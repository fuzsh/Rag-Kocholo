Without a doubt, Hall is a true scene stealer in the entire movie franchise. Appearing in Scary Movie 1 through 4 (we'll pretend 5 never happened, sorry Tisdale), the character is a fan favorite. Many would love a movie with Regina Hall in her own spin off as Brenda, but all these years later and we're still waiting. Until that moment comes, if ever...let's take a look at some of her best and funniest scenes:\n\nShe don't love herself! — Scene from Scary Movie (1999)\n\nWell it just would have been you! — Scene from Scary Movie 2 (2001)\n\nBrenda at the Movies — Scene from Scary Movie (1999)\n\nBrenda pranks Cindy, fights Samara — Scene from Scary Movie 3 (2003)\n\nDirrty Talk — Scene from Scary Movie 2 (2001)\n\nStop calling me! — Deleted Scene from Scary Movie (1999)\n\nNow who the fuck did that!? — Scene from Scary Movie 3 (2003)\n\nDetroit — Scene from Scary Movie 4 (2006)\n\nBrenda and Cindy in Saw — Scene from Scary Movie 4 (2006)\n\nOr y'all can watch, IDGAS! — Scene from Scary Movie 3 (2003)\n\nTake it Brandon!

The Spice Girls were at the height of their success as a global phenomenon and earning millions with their name on almost any product you can imagine, albeit reaching a point of overexposure after two and a half years of Spicemania.\n\nOn May 27th 1998, the Spice Girls were set to perform on the National Lottery to promote their single at the time \"Viva Forever\", which apparently was still a big deal for them to perform. Mel C did the honor of phoning in a reason of why Geri Horner fka Geri Halliwell did not make an appearance, stating that she was sick and wishing her to 'get well soon' -\n\nLittle did they know that they saw the last of Geri being part of the band just days before. She made her official announcement of departure on May 31st 1998 while she was a tax exile in France.\n\nThe Power of 5:\n\nIt made #headlinesfriendship never ends and devastated young fans, especially because it was before they were about to embark the American leg of the Spiceworld Tour (and also right before a European date). The girls' brand emphasized the #poweroffive with each member being as important as the next, ignoring you Posh haters.\n\nRetrospectively, Spice Girls fans recognized the oddness during the final months of the Spice Girls as a five piece. The girls made the bold move of firing their manager Simon Fuller 7 months prior after realizing about how much they were overworked. The press were skeptic about the decision because he was the 'mastermind' of leading the girls to where they were, but it seemed like a win for the girls to take more control.\n\nAesthetically speaking, the girls were changing too. Their outfits were toned down and less of their usual 'spice' personalities in daily wear - Geri's hair was no longer fiery red, Mel B's fro was shorter, Emma was wearing less babydoll dresses and more suits, and Victoria was becoming more personable and even smiling [more often] in their interviews, performances, and press photos... everything was just different:\n\nIn their interviews, the Geri's presence was starting to fizzle out.\n\nThe role of Ginger:\n\nGinger Spice was basically their head pr member with her outspokenness and remarks about the group's ambition, girl power, and politics (and not to discredit the other girls who did the same). Just note the classic Geri #antics like being flirty with Prince Charles when they met the royals, and her last minute DIY union jack dress which became an iconic symbol for the group and of the 90's.\n\nHer personality really clashed with member Mel B who was also known for her big personality. Together, they made up a volatile relationship. It's been known that these two connected well at first because of their dynamics in the group and because they both felt they met someone at their 'level'. This also meant frequent conflict.\n\nFans conspire with the idea Geri and Mel B had more than a friendship, given Mel B was experimental. Mel B's ex-boyfriend recounts that Mel B took Geri's exit the hardest because they were very close (see video at the end). It might be a stretch but this could have added to why Geri did not want to stay in the group.\n\nOver the years Geri varied the reasons why she left, so here's a short roundup:\n\n- The 'breast cancer campaign': Supposedly Geri was asked to be a spokesperson or endorse breast cancer awareness, but with the tight Spice Girls schedule, she was not allowed to. This triggered her to feeling like she was unable to do things on her own terms and lost the sense of control.\n\n- She felt that her role in the group was not needed: Since she was the oldest member, she had that 'lead' member cap on since day one. As the girls started to achieve success, it somehow meant that her importance in the group was diminishing. The girls were also discussing solo projects by this point.\n\n- Quarter-life crisis: In her Geri documentary, Geri confessed that her father passed away right before the beginning of the group. Being thrown into the whirlwind of a soaring pop career, she did not have time to cope with his death (also noting that she witnessed his dead body found in his home which she described in graphic detail). On top of dealing with loss, she was battling eating disorders and body dysmorphia. It became to much too handle. Luckily she had her idol growing up George Michael, who became a close friend to console her during the time she left and gave advice as she started her solo career.\n\nThe Spice Girls released \"Goodbye\" as their first single as a four-piece, and also dedicated a couple of tracks in reference to the fall out. As much as people want to undermine this era, the Spice Girls still did have a successful musical release with Forever, which spawned three more UK #1 singles for the group. It was a different image and sound, but a big shift nonetheless.\n\nGeri had some success in her career too with several hit singles, including the debut \"Look At Me\", featuring the infamous death of Ginger Spice, and the campy disco tune \"Bag It Up\". She very much carried the ginger spice attitude in her music, while critics were calling her desperate to become the next Madonna.\n\nLooking forward:\n\nYears later, Geri knew she made a huge mistake and sort of regretted the decision once she saw the girls were still succeeding with their r&b sound during 1999-2000. Of course the girls eventually forgave her and still thanked her at the Brit Awards in 2000 when both parties were performing separately.\n\nIn the end, what happened needed to happen.\n\nIt made an interesting turn of events in Spice Girls history given the fact that a pop act like them can reign supreme for only so long.\n\nWith Geri leaving, it gave them the push for reinvention and the girls to keep going as long as they could.\n\nI must say they kind of burned out in the right way, rather than faded. But they still reunited for that reunion tour in 2007! #cashthatcheck\n\nPeace, love, girl power, and #friendshipneverends\n\nAnd here are the points she made in her own words:\n\nOP might not have been existing long enough to be aware of life an active fan during the actual Spice Girls' heyday so if there is anything to mention/edit from this moment in #herstory it would be much appreciated!\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-flPOQ19Y4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTyWkyPUPlo\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SpiceGirlsNet/status/1000869227287412738\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFBWbH5CeRE\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/184674726\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Did Lady Gaga Copy Geri Halliwell?\n\nONTD Original:\n\nDid Lady Gaga Copy Geri Halliwell?\n\nMaybe the title of this is clickbaity because I truly want to make a \"Parallels between Geri and Gaga\" post a la my Hurts & Lana Del Rey post. I can't help but notice the fact that with some of these Gaga #moments, Geri Halliwell aka Geri Horner aka Ginger Spice of the best-selling girl group the Spice Girls did already years ago (and liddos like to act brand new). Queen of Pop Madonna can be the true person attributed for these women to thrive, so no this is not necessarily an exposé.\n\n💄\n\nOP's note: Definitely not comparing their musical and performance abilities, just so yall know.\n\n📰\n\nBut here's a #herstory lesson of the personal and creative parallels between these pop cultural icons.\n\nOpen Wide\n\nAt the 2000 Brit Awards, Geri did the grand entrance of appearing out of a pair of female legs for the flirty sex anthem \"Bag It Up\". Gaga had a similar performance style appearing out of a turkey inflatable body for the \"Born This Way\" number on the BTWB in 2013. What other pop stars have symbolically been rebirthed like this? Geri, an innovator.\n\nGeri (1999)&Five Foot Two (2016)\n\nI mean who loves a good documentary after a tumultuous pop phenomenon career? Each doc was filled with epiphanies by its subjects dealing with relationships and fame, topped with a moment where they were recorded in their bikini for a more #open talk.\n\nGeri was opening up about dealing with the loss of her father (that happened several years prior) after not deeply processing it. Gaga was beginning her #maudlin campaign about her father's sister Joanne, whom she mourns vicariously through her father's pain while her grandmother was lowkey cringing at ha.\n\nIdol to the Rescue\n\nGoing off with the Geri doc, she was at a rough point when she left the Spice Girls and became insecure about her abilities as an informally trained artist. Who better to run to than your idol growing up? Halliwell was very open about being a Wham/George Michael fan girl, even writing herself a love letter to him as a tween. The two finally met one day and became friends, where Michael offered her a place to stay after her departure in 1999. Since his death, Geri expressed how he was like an 'angel' to her in times of need.\n\nGeri on George Michael: \"I’d been part of a band and he literally picked up the phone and said come and live with me. He actually said, ‘come and live with me for the weekend’ and I stayed for about three months and then followed him everywhere... I was so broken and so sad and he scooped me up.\"\n\nGaga witnessed the same helping hand when she was going through ARTPOP turmoil where she admitted it was a time she was close to quitting music.\n\nIn her 2015 Billboard interview where she was quite on her pretentious musician high horse, she admitted how much Tony Bennett and Elton John were there for her: \"Tony has taught me a lot of things, Elton has taught me a lot of things... I'm very lucky when a lot of people turned their back on me and some of the modern universe turned their back on me, it was the classics that were there. They were there for me in friendship, professionally... 'we've been here before and we are here to tell you not to fuck this up'.\"\n\nLady Liberty 🗽\n\nBoth artists have also been very forward with integrating political imagery into their fashion, including their interpretations of the Statue of Liberty in tour costuming.\n\nGeri on the set of the \"Spice Up Your Life\" video shoot and Lady Gaga featured in V Magazine.\n\nGeri in Girl Power! Live in Istanbul and Lady Gaga on her Born This Way Ball Tour.\n\nMarilyn Moment 💋\n\nIt's another common thread that Marilyn Monroe were big inspirations to these women (and at this rate, who isn't). Both had a flirtatious encounter with a political leader when Geri planted a big one on Prince Charles' cheek during the Spice Girl's visit with the royals. She also attempted a more obvious Marilyn moment singing 'Happy Birthday' to him for his 50th.\n\nGaga was invited to perform for a Bill Clinton special in 2011 and made a cheeky move by dubbing \"Bad Romance\" with \"Bill Romance\". She said right on stage that she was having a Marilyn moment, and made a risque outro to her performance by playing \"Government Hooker\" which seemed to went pass the minds of regular people, but Gaga fans were in on the joke (He Stefani Lewinsky'd all on mah gowwwn).\n\n\"I Am Every Label\"\n\nWhen people try to put you in a box, you find ways to get out of them. Geri dealt with this theme in her debut \"Look At Me\" from the album Schizophonic when she depicted characters on how women are perceived to be.\n\nDuring the ARTPOP era where she felt the same thing, Gaga stated: \"The statement is that I’m not one icon. I’m every icon. I’m an icon that is made out of all the colors on the palette at every time. I have no restrictions. No restrictions.\"\n\nThey also embodied these figures to show they are not one dimensional acts.\n\n\"I play these four characters - what women are. I play a virgin, a vamp, a nun, and I think women have to take on so many roles in life. I think we're all of them and none of them.\"\n\nSchizophonic & ARTPOP\n\nWe love album titles that coin unoriginal portmanteaus as concepts! While Schizophonic is a little more digestable to understand, ARTPOP is a loose concept of 'putting art back on the soup can' or something like that.\n\nGeri spoke to Rosie about the lead single: \"The way we get obsessed with ourselves is bullcrap. We should take each other not on face value but on who you are as a human being. It's talking about labels'you're beautiful''you're fat''you're thing''you're gorgeous''you're gay''you're black'. I just find that you ought to see pass that as human beings.\"\n\nThis almost sound like lyrics to a particular song... Hmmmmm.\n\n\"Mi Chico Latino\"&\"Alejandro\"\n\nA Latin-pop tinged song where the music video features a homoerotic dance orgy number by a group of men in their boxer briefs? Geri BEEN doing that already. Get a little #herstory lesson here little monsters!\n\nAnywho, people have accredited Madonna's \"La Isla Bonita\" to inspiring these pop moments.\n\nSo, what's the tea? Geri has been pro-gay and girl power before the turn of the millennium when it was cool.\n\nAnd we'll have our sixth\n\nSpice Girl in this b****\n\nIt's a conspiracy yeah.gif\n\nSources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XciZowQi74\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO3kTdkzsR0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KszFVyBjGOs\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxI1iOi0t-c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUrLSRxuDoU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV5Yg4IQkyk\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/126458478\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n\"Who?\" Read a biography or a memoir for the ONTD Reading Challenge!\n\nJune's task in the 2018 ONTD Reading Challenge is \"Who?\" Read a Biography or a Memoir!\n\nMyself and milfordacademy have come up with 10 recs for this post.

And if you haven't yet, join the Goodreads group for the challenge!\n\nBIOGRAPHIES\n\nFrida: A Biography of Frida Kahloby Hayden Herrera\n\nOriginally published in 1983, Hayden Herrera's portrait of Frida Kahlo is the definitive biography of the tempestuous and original Mexican artist. Married to Diego Rivera and deeply involved in Mexican politics, she also had affairs with such diverse historical figures as Isamu Noguchi and Leon Trotsky. Her paintings, often autobiographical, have reached a wider audience through exhibitions over the last 20 years.Frida is both the basis for the new Miramax film and the primary source people will turn to for all the information on this dynamic figure of the 20th century.\n\nSophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionaryby Anita Anand\n\nIn 1876 Sophia Duleep Singh was born into Indian royalty. Her father, Maharajah Duleep Singh, was heir to the Kingdom of the Sikhs, one of the greatest empires of the Indian subcontinent, a realm that stretched from the lush Kashmir Valley to the craggy foothills of the Khyber Pass and included the mighty cities of Lahore and Peshawar. It was a territory irresistible to the British, who plundered everything, including the fabled Koh-I-Noor diamond.\n\nExiled to England, the dispossessed Maharajah transformed his estate at Elveden in Suffolk into a Moghul palace, its grounds stocked with leopards, monkeys and exotic birds. Sophia, god-daughter of Queen Victoria, was raised a genteel aristocratic Englishwoman: presented at court, afforded grace and favor lodgings at Hampton Court Palace and photographed wearing the latest fashions for the society pages. But when, in secret defiance of the British government, she travelled to India, she returned a revolutionary.\n\nSophia transcended her heritage to devote herself to battling injustice and inequality, a far cry from the life to which she was born. Her causes were the struggle for Indian Independence, the fate of the lascars, the welfare of Indian soldiers in the First World War – and, above all, the fight for female suffrage. She was bold and fearless, attacking politicians, putting herself in the front line and swapping her silks for a nurse's uniform to tend wounded soldiers evacuated from the battlefields. Meticulously researched and passionately written, this enthralling story of the rise of women and the fall of empire introduces an extraordinary individual and her part in the defining moments of recent British and Indian history.\n\nThe Woman Who Would Be King: Hatshepsut's Rise to Power in Ancient Egyptby Kara Cooney\n\nHatshepsut, the daughter of a general who took Egypt's throne without status as a king’s son and a mother with ties to the previous dynasty, was born into a privileged position of the royal household. Married to her brother, she was expected to bear the sons who would legitimize the reign of her father’s family. Her failure to produce a male heir was ultimately the twist of fate that paved the way for her inconceivable rule as a cross-dressing king. At just twenty, Hatshepsut ascended to the rank of king in an elaborate coronation ceremony that set the tone for her spectacular twenty-two year reign as co-regent with Thutmose III, the infant king whose mother Hatshepsut out-maneuvered for a seat on the throne. Hatshepsut was a master strategist, cloaking her political power plays with the veil of piety and sexual expression. Just as women today face obstacles from a society that equates authority with masculinity, Hatshepsut had to shrewdly operate the levers of a patriarchal system to emerge as Egypt's second female pharaoh.\n\nHatshepsut had successfully negotiated a path from the royal nursery to the very pinnacle of authority, and her reign saw one of Ancient Egypt’s most prolific building periods. Scholars have long speculated as to why her images were destroyed within a few decades of her death, all but erasing evidence of her rule. Constructing a rich narrative history using the artifacts that remain, noted Egyptologist Kara Cooney offers a remarkable interpretation of how Hatshepsut rapidly but methodically consolidated power—and why she fell from public favor just as quickly. The Woman Who Would Be King traces the unconventional life of an almost-forgotten pharaoh and explores our complicated reactions to women in power.\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine: A Lifeby Alison Weir\n\nRenowned in her time for being the most beautiful woman in Europe, the wife of two kings and mother of three, Eleanor of Aquitaine was one of the great heroines of the Middle Ages. At a time when women were regarded as little more than chattel, Eleanor managed to defy convention as she exercised power in the political sphere and crucial influence over her husbands and sons. In this beautifully written biography, Alison Weir paints a vibrant portrait of this truly exceptional woman, and provides new insights into her intimate world. Eleanor of Aquitaine lived a long life of many contrasts, of splendor and desolation, power and peril, and in this stunning narrative, Weir captures the woman-- and the queen--in all her glory. With astonishing historic detail, mesmerizing pageantry, and irresistible accounts of royal scandal and intrigue, she recreates not only a remarkable personality but a magnificent past era.\n\nMEMOIRS\n\nIn Order to Live: A North Korean Girl's Journey to Freedomby Yeonmi Park\n\n'I am most grateful for two things: that I was born in North Korea, and that I escaped from North Korea.'\n\nYeonmi Park was not dreaming of freedom when she escaped from North Korea. She didn't even know what it meant to be free. All she knew was that she was running for her life, that if she and her family stayed behind they would die - from starvation, or disease, or even execution.\n\nThis book is the story of Park's struggle to survive in the darkest, most repressive country on earth; her harrowing escape through China's underworld of smugglers and human traffickers; and then her escape from China across the Gobi desert to Mongolia, with only the stars to guide her way, and from there to South Korea and at last to freedom; and finally her emergence as a leading human rights activist - all before her 21st birthday.\n\nBookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Readingby Lucy Mangan\n\nShe was whisked away to Narnia – and Kirrin Island – and Wonderland. She ventured down rabbit holes and womble burrows into midnight gardens and chocolate factories. She wandered the countryside with Milly-Molly-Mandy, and played by the tracks with the Railway Children. With Charlotte’s Web she discovered Death and with Judy Blume it was Boys. No wonder she only left the house for her weekly trip to the library or to spend her pocket money on amassing her own at home.\n\nIn Bookworm, Lucy revisits her childhood reading with wit, love and gratitude. She relives our best-beloved books, their extraordinary creators, and looks at the thousand subtle ways they shape our lives. She also disinters a few forgotten treasures to inspire the next generation of bookworms and set them on their way.\n\nMy Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell\n\nMy Family and Other Animals is the bewitching account of a rare and magical childhood on the island of Corfu by treasured British conservationist Gerald Durrell. It is also the first book in Durrell's Corfu Trilogy, which inspired ITV's television series The Durrells.\n\nEscaping the ills of the British climate, the Durrell family - acne-ridden Margo, gun-toting Leslie, bookworm Lawrence and budding naturalist Gerry, along with their long-suffering mother and Roger the dog - take off for the island of Corfu.\n\nBut the Durrells find that, reluctantly, they must share their various villas with a menagerie of local fauna - among them scorpions, geckos, toads, bats and butterflies.\n\nRecounted with immense humour and charm My Family and Other Animals is a wonderful account of a rare, magical childhood.\n\nThe Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaustby Edith Hahn Beer\n\nEdith Hahn was an outspoken young woman in Vienna when the Gestapo forced her into a ghetto and then into a slave labor camp. When she returned home months later, she knew she would become a hunted woman and went underground. With the help of a Christian friend, she emerged in Munich as Grete Denner. There she met Werner Vetter, a Nazi Party member who fell in love with her. Despite Edith's protests and even her eventual confession that she was Jewish, he married her and kept her identity a secret.\n\nIn wrenching detail, Edith recalls a life of constant, almost paralyzing fear. She tells how German officials casually questioned the lineage of her parents; how during childbirth she refused all painkillers, afraid that in an altered state of mind she might reveal something of her past; and how, after her husband was captured by the Soviets, she was bombed out of her house and had to hide while drunken Russian soldiers raped women on the street.\n\nDespite the risk it posed to her life, Edith created a remarkable record of survival. She saved every document, as well as photographs she took inside labor camps. Now part of the permanent collection at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., these hundreds of documents, several of which are included in this volume, form the fabric of a gripping new chapter in the history of the Holocaust—complex, troubling, and ultimately triumphant.\n\nBrain on Fire: My Month of Madness by Susannah Cahalan\n\nWhen twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a hospital room, strapped to her bed and unable to move or speak, she had no memory of how she’d gotten there. Days earlier, she had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: at the beginning of her first serious relationship and a promising career at a major New York newspaper. Now she was labeled violent, psychotic, a flight risk. What happened?\n\nIn a swift and breathtaking narrative, Cahalan tells the astonishing true story of her descent into madness, her family’s inspiring faith in her, and the lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didn’t happen.\n\nNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass by Frederick Douglass\n\nPublished in the bicentenary year of Frederick Douglass’s birth and in a Black Lives Matter era, this edition of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass presents new research into his life as an activist and an author. A revolutionary reformer who traveled in Scotland, Ireland, England, and Wales as well as the US, Douglass published many foreign-language editions of his Narrative. While there have been many Douglasses over the decades and even centuries, the Frederick Douglass we need now is no iconic, mythic, or legendary self-made man but a fallible, mortal, and human individual: a husband, father, brother, and son. His rallying cry inspires today’s activism: “Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!”\n\nRecognizing that Douglass was bought and sold on the northern abolitionist podium no less than on the southern auction block, this edition introduces readers to Douglass’s multiple declarations of independence. The Narrative appears alongside his private correspondence as well as the early speeches and writings in which he did justice to the “grim horrors of slavery.” This volume also traces Douglass’s activism and authorship in the context of the reformist work of his wife, Anna Murray, and of his daughters and sons.\n\nOther Sources - Goodreads lists\n\nBest Strange and Twisted MemoirsBest Memoir / Biography / Autobiography\n\nBiography and Memoirs that are BETTER than Fiction\n\nBest Biographies\n\n100 Biographies & Memoirs to Read in a Lifetime: Readers' Picks\n\nAlso, since we're at the halfway mark for this year's challenge, here are links to our previous months' tasks:\n\nJANUARY - Read a book being adapted to a tv show or a film in 2018: Part 1; Part 2\n\nFEBRUARY -Come to Brazil!\n\nMARCH - Ha Impact!\n\nAPRIL - Sure, Jan\n\nMAY -Men Are Weak!\n\nSOURCES 12345678910\n\nBook post!!!\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: 5 Songs that are Superior to their Studio and/or More Well-Known Counterparts\n\nThere once was a demo song;\n\nin the studio, it all went wrong.\n\nThe Man said to \"fix it!\"\n\nProduction went and mixed it,\n\nalthough it was good all along.\n\nA demo, live, or one-off version of a song being preferred by fans to its studio counterpart is a tale as old as time. Here are five songs — chosen by your friendly neighborhood babs — that are examples of this. Add more to the comments!\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nғɪᴠᴇ. Diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey (Demo)\n\n\"I'm not gonna listen to what the past says, I've been waiting up all night /\n\nTake another drag, turn me to ashes / Ready for another lie?\"\n\nLana Del Rey has always been open about her love for Britney Spears, even once admitting that, \"there is something about Britney that [has always] compelled\" her. Lana's album Born To Die had a lot of Britney's musical influence, and 'Diet Mountain Dew' is one track that evolved with that influence. Its original form, however, had a more dramatic sound which, arguably, suited the bittersweet lyrics more than the catchy beat in the finalized edit.\n\nғᴏᴜʀ. Part of Your World from Disney's The Little Mermaid (Reprise)\n\n\"I don't know when, I don't know how, but I know something's starting right now /\n\nWatch and you'll see / Someday, I'll be part of your world\"\n\nIf you thought you were going to get a list of Lana Del Rey's demos and only Lana Del Rey's demos here, you'd be dead wrong, sonny boy. This collection wouldn't be complete without an original Disney track. Ariel sings about her wants and desires in 'Part of Your World', nearly dwelling on what could be. Interestingly, the more well-known track never says part of your world - rather, she sings part of that world. 'Your' world doesn't come until the reprise version of the song, which explores a more ambitious and encouraged Ariel. The track's prelude climbs as high as Ariel has at this point in the film and it stays there. The tune retains that naive, fresh optimism and finishes off with an epic explosion of desire. If there was ever character development in a set of songs, this is it.\n\nᴛʜʀᴇᴇ. Don't Dream It's Over by Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande (Cover)\n\n\"You're an angel, Ariana Grande\"\n\nThe original, by Crowded House, was majestic to begin with, but the addition of female voices really brought something extra to the ballad. The song, admittedly, could have done without Miley's shameless flirting and Bangerz/smoking-all-the-time-era voice, but Ariana's parts slayed a bit.\n\nᴛᴡᴏ. Boy by Aly & AJ / 78violet (Live session)\n\n\"I wanted a tree, boy / But you gave me a leaf, boy / It's nothing to me, boy /\n\nI gave you the world, boy / Without a return, boy / And now I'm just hurt, boy\"\n\nAly and AJ departed from Hollywood Records in 2009 after renaming themselves 78violet. The intention was to create music that they had full control over, rather than being held back by pop rock tunes. The Michalka sisters never released an album under 78violet, despite working on one. The studio version of 'Boy' never materialized, so this live session is technically the final product, but who's to say! They have performed this song in front of an audience, but nothing can quite compare to the haunting and unrefined sound the Tastemakers Session brought it.\n\nᴏɴᴇ. Sex[xx] Dreams by Lady Gaga (Demo/Raw)\n\n\"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my god!\"\n\nLady Gaga was once at the top.\n\nWhen an artist reaches her peak, it's only natural for her to go down. But she can either climb down with the strength and knowledge that brought her up, or she can tumble down. For quite some time, Lady Gaga has been the queen of disappointment: ARTPOP was the prelude to this. When she performed Sexxx Dreams at her iTunes #SWINEFEST nearly five years ago, fans and haters on ONTD had to change their pants. It was an instant hit and expectations were high. The studio version of Sexxx Dreams ended up being an over-produced mess that had us aggressively searching for an audience-free rip of her iTunes Festival version. Luckily, we now have access to the demo version, though this one isn't without its flaws; the dip in Gaga's voice at 1:34 in the OP video was a bad idea, and the entire track sounds like a demo. Yet, it still overpowers its finalized version in both sound and sex appeal.\n\nThough, OP's personal favourite is the small clip we got in its teaser video, before the added Xs/nonsense:\n\nSources: (1, 2), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nAdd your favs!\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: The 1960's Reimagined in Pop\n\nAriana Grande - \"Problem\"What I wanna say is that Pr*blem is one of Ari's worst singles and she could have used the 60's theme for the true lead single \"Be My Baby\" ft. Cashmere Cat with a \"Be My Baby\" Ronettes tribute. #JusticeForBeMyBaby\n\nMariah Carey - \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\"This is a less popular video to the song which encapsulated the 60's feel people tend to mistaken as a cover from that time. Just remember she is a *Mariah voice* songwriter who made demos in studios since she was 19 who WROTE AIWFC.Lana Del Rey - \"Lust For Life\"It was rumored the song+video referenced an actress from the 1920's named Peg Entwistle who killed herself falling off the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, but Lana later denied that. I still don't know the meaning of singing about the 'h' specifically.\n\nHonorable mention: \"Love\", every other LDR related thingWonder Girls - \"NOBODY\"I don't pay attention to kpop that often anymore but I remember this song being one of the bigger hits from SK that was given a big push to the U.S. (along with many other kpop attempts)Lauryn Hill - \"Doo-Wop\"An iconic debut from Lauryn Hill where she debuted at #1 on the Hot 100, Lauryn plays a 60's and contemporary version of herself. This was the only solo female rap #1 song for a while until recently with a certain song that may or may not have been a hit with a viral rapper.Lykke Li - \"Sadness Is a Blessing\"Lykke Li has proven time and time again she can write sad songs that sound happy/boppable. There's an official video, but in this performance video she directly takes from the retro television aesthetics.Kali Uchis - \"Know What I Want\"Por Vida alluded to a lot of lo-fi and doo-wop songs of the 60's. It was her main schtick until she mixed it up with the reggaeton \"Nuestro Planeta\".Cruel Youth - \"Diamond Days\"\"#JusticeForPerfectionist\n\nHonorable mentions: \"Kill My Boyfriend\", \"Boys Don't Cry\", \"Outta Time\", and 30MG EPMØ - \"Never Wanna know\"MØ, known mostly for her break out global hit \"Lean On\", is often overlooked for actually having the banger indie pop debut album No Mythologies to Follow. At the time the dreamy \"Never Wanna Know\" was released, she was often compared to rising star Lana Del Rey. Looking back, these comparisons were a reach with MØ's distinctive voice.Duffy - \"Mercy\"A name you probably haven't heard in years and a relic of the mid 2000s, Duffy is a one hit wonder was known for her breakout album Rockferry.Marina And The Diamonds - \"Primadonna\" (Acoustic)The Electra Heart era was a golden era for sad gay tumblr pop. Marina used a lot of girly vintage aesthetics during this time.Janelle Monáe - \"Dance Apocalyptic\"Legenelle stays an underrated artist even with her critically acclaimed discography and serves looks on looks 99% of the time. 60's themes were seen since the ArchAndroid.Beyonce - \"Get Me Bodied\"Bey paid tribute to Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity with this video featuring her lil sis and backup singers of a previous band she grew up working with.Emma Bunton - \"Maybe\"And a couple of years before Bey, Emma Bunton fka Baby Spice turned Sexy Spice paid tribute to the musical as well with the 60's French jazz pop-inspired \"Maybe\".Chløë Black - \"27 Club\"And to end on a macabre note, how can I leave out \"27 Club\" which is about the drug fueled rock & roll decadence of the 27 Club myth that name drops Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.

We're halfway done with '18 already (ya i know). This year has served some good horror so far, some blockbusters and some not! But we all know blockbusters and ratings don't mean shit (looking at you, Roseanne). So to mark, let's take a look at some of the standout horror in this year.\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nThe extended stretches of quiet really added to the jump scares. Originally considered to be part of the Cloverfield universe, that idea was scrapped but the monsters still give me Cloverfield mama monster teas.\n\nMom And Dad\n\nProbably the most slept on horror this year, this movie delivered and it was good to see the good sis Selma Blair back in something I would watch. THe premise? Parents get overwhelmed with the urge to kill their kids. It explores the theme of parental regret, both subtle and no-so-subtle, which is still too taboo to talk about and I can see parents watching this and secretly relating. Bonus if you love watching Nicolas Cage freak out.\n\nDownrange\n\nGripping, amazing, and gory!! The premise? A group of 20 somethings are carpooling and become a target of a nihilistic Tr*** supporter sniper and they take shelter from the side of their car. Minimal location of filming really lends to the intensity and it has a twist ending you will either love or hate.\n\nPyewacket\n\nA metalhead teen at odds with her mom, Andrea from TWD,Laurie Holden, takes to a spell to kill her. It is cliche that a teen dressing in black and listens to black metal would do something like this...but overlooking that, it becomes a race in time if she actually wants to see it through or no.\n\nThe Endless\n\nA decade after two brothers escape a death cult, they get a video from a member they left behind so they go back as a way of also getting closure. They find maybe the worship at Camp Arcadia wasn't bs after all.\n\nGhost Stories\n\nA professor and paranormal investigator is devoted to debunking anything supernatural. He gets three different unsolved mysteries and can't figure out how to debunk these ones. Hmm!\n\nThat's it for this half-year...Art the clown says see ya in December for the year-end list!\n\nSource23456\n\nOntd, what are your horror favs this year?\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: With Roseanne cancelled, here are five revival ideas ABC can replace it with\n\nWith Roseanne rightfully cancelled and off the air, the Twitterverse and several other outlets have come forward to give the ABC Network some revival ideas and suggestions to fill the spot left vacant by the show's recent cancellation. Here are five TV shows (mainly former ABC shows) that I've compiled thanks to social media. These are the shows that most people have been quite vocal about reviving long before and after the news about Roseanne's cancellation went public.\n\nEnlisted aired on FOX in 2014 for one season. The show is about three brothers enlisted in the Army and living together on the base. Now the show did not run on ABC, but show runner Kevin Biege tweeted the network offering to hire the entire Roseanne crew to work on a Enlisted revival: “Dear Channing Dungey, Since there's going to be a hole in your schedule next year can we bring back Enlisted? @MikeRoyce and me and the gang can put together a season very quickly! Also we can just hire the entire crew of that show that just went away! Love, Me” Bless.\n\nHappy Endings aired on ABC from 2011 to 2013 for three seasons and follows six best friends living in Chicago. No message from creator David Caspe to ABC here. But to be fair, he's been very vocal about it on several ocassions and just earlierthis month. Everyone else on Twitter took the opportunity to let ABC know that they want this revival for the 34,930,352th time.\n\nPushing Dasies aired on ABC from 2007 to 2009. A comedy drama that follows Ned with an ability to bring people back to life with a single touch. The day Roseanna was cancelled, show creator Bryan Fuller tweeted, “Not to be opportunistic, but if you're itching to fill that Roseanne slot with another former @ABCNetwork Show...” Several others on social media were very vocal about bringing back this show.\n\nSelfie aired on ABC in 2014 for one season and is based on the musical My Fair Lady. A story with a modern twist and gone too soon from our airwaves, we will never truly know what could have been. Another non-tweet from the creators, but plenty of online supporters.\n\nDon't Trust the Bitch in Apt 23 aired on ABC from 2012 to 2013 for two seasons. The show about two unexpected roommates who build a friendship also features James Van Der Beek as a parody of himself. No messages from the creator to ABC, but again, plenty of online support. Just maybe.\n\nShow creators tweet ABC:\n\nEveryone else:\n\n...and several others. But you get the idea. Or you know, new original content can be created too. But we know that will most likely end up cancelled too and Hollywood is running out of ideas anyways so. Bring back a show with a built in fanbase tbh.\n\nsending letters and selfies to ABC pleading our case like...\n\nSources:1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Top 4 Japanese Shows on Netflix That I Highly Recommend\n\n1. TERRACE HOUSE (BOYS & GIRLS IN THE CITY/OPENING NEW DOORS)\n\nGeneral synopsis: Terrace House is an unscripted show about six strangers, men and women, living together. The roommates have access to a car and are free to leave the house at any time to date, work or study. The cast are replaced individually throughout the show. There are presenters in a separate studio who comment on the developments in the house.\n\nReasons why you should watch this: After years of watching American reality television, it was a breath of fresh air to watch something that wasn't nearly as forced as say, 'Are You the One?', especially right as you're going to bed. There's nothing groundbreaking about Terrace House, but it's a slow burn that's perfect for relaxing. Although it should be noted that Aloha State is the worst among the three series on Netflix.\n\n2. HIBANA: SPARK\n\nGeneral synopsis: Tokunaga is an unpopular comedian. He happens to meet comedian Kamiya who has quite a foul mouth and a genius sense of comedy. Tokunaga is strongly attracted to Kamiya and asks if he could mentor him. Kamiya accepts. Every night they talk about comedy while drinking alcohol. Tokunaga slowly gains popularity as part of his comedy duo. Meanwhile, Kamiya has a hard time because everything doesn't work out. Kamiya falls into debt and suddenly he disappears.\n\nReasons why you should watch this: It was one of the most peculiar Japanese dramas I've ever watched, but the chemistry between the two main actors and the colorful supporting cast made it very enjoyable. The last episode was quite strange and one of the main characters does something idiotic and reckless. Watch to find out what that is!\n\n3. AINORI LOVE WAGON: ASIAN JOURNEY\n\nGeneral synopsis: Seven men and women board a pink bus in search of true love. On a journey through Asia with strangers, their goal is to return to Japan as a couple.\n\nReasons why you should watch this: Another slow burn Japanese reality show that revolves around a group of men and women who go on a road trip across several Asian countries in order to find love. Some will find it boring, but I found it highly enjoyable because of one cast member, Depparin, and the hilarious drama that ensued.\n\n4. REA(L)OVE\n\nGeneral synopsis: A dating show set on an Okinawan beach with 18 men and women, under pseudonyms, who all have a \"dark history\" of crime or adultery and want a new start with romance.\n\nReasons why you should watch this: It provides various dramatic scenes that are often funny. You should be warned though. One of the hosts, Atsushi Tamura, is extremely misogynistic in nature and makes inappropriate comments about several female cast members.\n\nSOURCES: Netflix, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nThank you for your time, ONTD.\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: What Ever Happened to the Kanye West Foundation?\n\nAfter the Twitter exchange between Kim Kardashian and Rhymefest with the former using childish taunts to undermine Rhymefest’s involvement with Donda’s House, the charity changed its named citing Kardashian’s social media rant. Before formally dropping the name, the charity alleged that sponsors had been dropping and that Kanye West was not supplying the financial backing for the charity to be sustained. (Donda’s House has also been cited this year by not being in good standing with Illinois after not submitting their data collection by the deadline. This has since been resolved with the charity now in “good standing”.) However, Donda’s House is not the only charity that seems be dropped by Kanye West. The Kanye West Foundation, a separate entity from Donda’s House, was founded around 2006 in order to curb high school dropout rates, which mostly affects black and Latino students. Though the Foundation was not financed by West, but instead companies associated with West. Why the foundation was closed was not directly cited, funding drastically slowed down after the death of West’s mother in 2007 with the foundation considered closed in 2011.\n\nThe foundation’s former executive director, Joseph Collins sent the following email to media outlets and sponsors: “I am reaching out to let you know that the Kanye West Foundation has officially closed it doors after a successful 4+ years of programming and events. It has been an incredible experience working with Kanye and the board to realize his mother’s vision and I am honored to have been given the opportunity to lead the Foundation.\" Collins did not elaborate and directed that any media outlet that wanted to know more needed to contact West, however there is no evidence of West commenting further about the foundation’s closure. Collins relocated from New York to Los Angeles to run the foundation, but is now President and CEO of Inner-City Arts in LA.\n\nOn record, there were two benefit concerts for the foundation called SHOW (Students Helping the World) which was planned to be an annual event in 2009 and 2010. The event was planned as a motivator for students to improve their GPA to earn tickets to the show. West donated $88,501 to the foundation in 2010. A compilation of finances showed the charity spent more money on overhead expenses, such as employee salaries, taxes, legal fees, travel expenses and a very small percentage of that money went to aid students with no money being given in 2010. IRS filings showed that only $583 going to causes in 2009. Usually only 15 – 20 percent of contributions should be used for overhead expenses in charities. The URL for the foundation now redirects to a shop selling custom mats.\n\nSources: 123456\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Is Chester Lockhart the Gay King of Pop We Need?\n\nWe've been putting our La Toya magnifying glass gif onto so many gay male pop stars and I can only think of MNEK who's giving the girls what we want and reppin the gays in which we need.\n\nThanks to newcomer legend Rina Sawayama's Twitter feed, I stumbled upon this artist named Chester Lockhart who's giving us queer pop ensembles, dance moves, and stage presence.\n\nIs he the gay king of pop we need in the midst of vanilla white bread brand of gay pop a la certain UK artists currently reigning?\n\nCheck out his music video for his single \"In Loving Memory\" -\n\nHis aesthetics is serving me Perfectionist era Natalia Kills and Liberation era Xtina lol\n\nSources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MycMhNFSw-U\n\nhttps://twitter.com/breezysoDOPE_/status/998319888975314944\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_EGxmGpNw\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD (not so) Original: Ugly trends on the rise!\n\nInspired by this ONTD post.\n\ni only did 5 bc i'm tired\n\nChunky dad sneakers\n\nThicc shoes are all the rage right now (and have been for a while). Thanks, Balenciaga. All your faves are sporting this look (e.g. Rihanna, pictured above). However, a lot of these shoes are in the $1000 range, despite their retro & dated look.

I'm seeing a lot of these on Instagram models and online stores like Missguided, Boohoo, Fashionnova, etc. They're a comfy trend, at least.\n\nShimmery, minimalistic eyeshadow\n\nInspired mostly by Stila's Shimmer & Glow Liquid Eye Shadow, this is a trend I've seen a few Youtube Beauty Gurus talk about (mainly only Stila's product in question tho, which possibly could mean they were paid to...? hmmmmmmmm) It's also a big trend in the South Korean makeup sphere right now (seemingly with more glitter), with multiple brands like 3CE&Clio having single products dedicating to creating the look.\n\nBum bags/Fanny packs/Belt bags\n\nThey're trending rn. Wearing one of these crossbody style is a l o o k, imo.\n\ncredit:\n\nchunky sneakers:img 1, img 2, one, two, three\n\nhair snap clips:img, one\n\nbiker shorts:img 1, img 2, one, two\n\nshimmery, minimalistic eyes:img, one, two, three\n\nfanny packs:img, one\n\ngeneral references: one,two, three& my eyes looking @ fashion sites.\n\nngl i like p much all of these trends lol\n\nwhat are y'all's favourite trend or trends? any that you hate with a passion? any you want to make a comeback? please share!\n\n↧\n\nIndie Film Release Guide: June 1st [An ONTD Original]\n\nThis week is pretty weak for big studio releases - Johnny Knoxville's Action Point is the only new thing in theaters.

Some particular bandmates have been accused of heinous crimes in recent times so we'll have to skip out on mentioning that certain band. But lettuce not forget the other acts that have been established/around for a while.\n\nHere's a lil flashback Friday to 6 underrated singles and album cuts from boybands that OP routinely plays.\n\n6. New Kids on the Block - \"Single\"\n\nI truly can't recall a classic NKOTB tune besides the \"step by step, ooOOoh baby\" line, so I was really introduced to them with \"Single\" which was written by Ne-Yo in his golden era. This was an excellent comeback song because it gave 90's r&b FEELS, and I personally prefer it over Ne-Yo's solo version off his Year of the Gentleman album.\n\n5. Jodeci - \"Every Moment\"\n\nAnother comeback single from the legendary boyband Jodeci, they picked right where they left off in \"Every Moment\" with their classic bass-y harmonies, rich melodies, and K-Ci runs. They did their original sound justice after a 20 year hiatus.\n\nHonorable mention: \"I'm Still Waiting\"\n\n4. NSYNC - \"Do Your Thing\"\n\nThis is a more recent discovery via independent pop icon LIZ who wrote with JC Chasez for her song \"Do I Like U\", which has a similar vibe to the album track \"Do Your Thing\" off of Celebrity.\n\n3. BIGBANG - \"Ego\"\n\n\"Ego\" is on their rerelase of the Alive album and I was 100% here for it and for them up until this era. I prefer this Japanese version bc the rhymes flowed better, but it's still a simple and underrated gem.\n\n2. Blackstreet - \"Think About You\"\n\n\"Think About You\" sonically reminds me of their remix version of Janet's \"I Get Lonely\". This Teddy Riley production is reminiscent of the popular late 90's r&b sound that was happening at the time a la other Timbaland songs and SftP's \"My Love is the Shhh\", another freaknasty bop.\n\n1. Shai - \"Waiting For the Day\"\n\nThis pure and innocent album cut about abstinence has the definitive new jack swing sound of the early 90's. The beat makes ya wanna dance and the airy synths just makes ya nostalgic about a time you didn't even live in.\n\nDo these songs give you the feels?\n\nSources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3rRj4opq6U\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k84exD3WKbc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xVdP_Sfu-g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL5GxwjqXNM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EJUDRpvIs0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iTkHE7Zyes\n\n↧\n\nONTD ORIGINAL: The half-year in review (In ONTD Comments)\n\nOne problem that has plagued forgetful ONTDers since time's beginning is....never remembering the posts and comments they want to nominate for the end of the year's \"Best of\" Festivities.\n\nSo, being someone who has saved thousands of internet comments from 2010 (seriously), I decided to poke through my 2018 collection and see, at the least, what I thought was funny enough. I didn't post everything, as I'm sure some stuff I have saved ya'll wouldn't find funny. Just one more tragedy of being a genius.\n\nThis obvs. isn't a comprehensive list. I don't go into every post about....The Bachelor or Teen Wolf or Sportball or whatever.\n\nI'm not familiar with her beyond \"All The Stars\", and surely, if the first two comments were well-wishers, the post would have started off differently.\n\nBut they weren't.\n\n(\"You can't injure what was already dead.\", \"I guess that's what happens when you sing in italics\")\n\nEventually, the comments did cycle around to \"Damn, ya'll mean, I hope she gets better :(\" and \"lol ONTD and their relationships with women.\"\n\nThe \"We are all learning\" protegeé netted a cover and people were pumped.\n\nI can't say those people were on ONTD, but they are somewhere, and they were pumped. Us, not so much.\n\n(\"I can tell I'm not attracted to him, because I don't even want to erotically wax his unibrow for him. Like, I'd do it, but I'd charge him money.\")\n\n(\"y tho? He looks like he is about to succumb to tuberculosis.\")\n\nTwo\n\nAll in all, he went home with nothing on Oscar Night.\n\nShifting gears to Timothée's Co-Star, Christmas Card King Armie Hammer and his millions of dollars couldn't take the heat of one author's Buzzfeed article and deleted twitter.\n\nBut what made him so upset?\n\n(\"so what exactly happened? every time I wanted to read the post, there were like 600 comments lmao\"\n\n\"Some edge white lady wrote a hit piece on him being a potato and he and his stans shat their pants\")\n\nI'm pretty sure he returned to Twitter, or perhaps he is lying in wait for another set of letters to come together and attack him.\n\nMy personal favorite post of the year so far, where everyone gathered around and truly proved the old ONTD slogan; The celebrities are disposable unless they are ugly white men, my own faves not included because I have the pinnacle of good taste.\n\nThere are just too many comments to pick;\n\n(\"Paul Ryan? omg he's so scary to look at.\")\n\nOne\n\n(\"Ok, I find Tom Hiddles and Jamie Bell attractive and I thought those were the type of guys that were going to be on this list. I came in all ready to shrug and just own it, but...\n\nC'mon girls, Mitt Romney? Look at your fucking choices\"\n\n\"Hiddles tho???\")\n\nTwo\n\nThough some people wanted it #gone.\n\n(\"mods, delete this republican propaganda\"\n\n\"this Sinclair Broadcasting post\")\n\nthree\n\nAgain, haven't clearly gotten through every post, so I leave the rest to you. What do you hope to remember in another 6 months besides the misdeeds of everyone's fave but yours?\n\nsources: Us! Also, they're linked throughout the post. I can change it to all down here if need be.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Exploring the Lyrical Content of Kanye's New Album, \"Ye\"\n\nAfter delving into Justin Timberlake's lyrical nonsense, I thought we could take a moment to examine Kanye's latest offering given the media storm surrounding the rollout of his latest album, Ye.Trigger Warning because it's jam packed with misogyny and some disturbing content regarding his mental health:\n\nTrack 1: I Thought About Killing You\n\n\"Today I seriously thought about killing you / I contemplated / pre-meditated murder / And I think about killing myself and I love myself way more than I love you...so...\"\n\n\"You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love\"\n\n\"I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it so it doesn't come off...bad.../ But sometimes I think really bad things / Really really really bad things\"\n\nTrack 2: Yikes\n\nAn aptly named song because the lyrics include the following:\n\n\"Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help / Sometimes I scare myself\"\n\n\"Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too / I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd / Thinkin' what if that happened to me too? / Then I'm on E! News\"\n\n\"See, ya'll really shocked but I'm really not / You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?\"\n\n\"I can feel the spirits all around me / I think Prince and Mike was tryna to warn me / They know I got demons all on me / Devil been tryna make an army / They been strategizin' to harm me / They don't know they dealin' with a zombie\"\n\nAt the end of the song he says his bipolar disorder isn't a disability, it's a super power:\n\n\"I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero! Agggh!\"\n\nTrack 3: All Mine\n\n\"If I pull up with a Kerry Washington / That's gon' be an enormous scandal / I could have Naomi Campbell / And still might want me a Stormy Daniels / Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up / I call that takin' Corey Gambles\"\n\n\"All these thots on Christian Mingle / Almost what got Tristan single / If you don't ball like him or Kobe / Guaranteed that bitch gonna leave you\"\n\n\"I love your titties 'cause they prove I can focus on two things at once\"\n\n\"Let me hit it raw, like fuck the outcome / Ayy, none of us would be here without cum\"\n\nTrack 4: Wouldn't Leave\n\n\"I said, 'Slavery a choice' - they said, 'How, Ye? / Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day / Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls / My wife callin', screamin', sayin', 'We 'bout to lose it all!' / Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe / Told her she could leave me now but she wouldn't leave\"\n\nTrack 5: No Mistakes\n\nPossibly addressing Drake here:\n\n\"Ain't no love lost but the gloves off\"\n\n\"Truth told I like you / Too bold to type you / Too rich to fight you / Calm down, you light skin!\"\n\nTrack 6: Ghost Town\n\n\"And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kind of free / We're still the kids that we used to be / I put my hand on a stove to see if I still bleed\"\n\nTrack 7: Violent Crimes\n\nThe last track on the album sees Kanye doing that classic male bullshit routine of, \"Now I have a daughter so I see women as people instead of objects!: Even though his lyrics still say otherwise...\n\n\"Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma / 'Cause now I see women as something to nurture / Not something to conquer\"\n\n\"Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates / Just play piano and stick to karate / I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's\"\n\n\"Curves under your dress / I know it's pervs all on the net / All in the comments, you wanna vomit\"\n\nWanna vomit, indeed!\n\nSources: 1 / 2 / 3\n\n↧\n\n10 (Alleged) Celeb Nose Jobs: Who Admits It, Who Denies It and Who Won't Say (ONTD Original)\n\nSome of them admit to it and some deny it, but these celebrities all appear to have lost some nasal real estate.\n\nScarlett Johansson once threatened to sue US Weekly for suggesting she had a nose job, but her nose does appear considerably narrower than it did in her teen years. Add in some peroxide, and she went from cute child actress to A-list sex symbol almost overnight.\n\nZachary Quinto had a much larger schnozz in his high school yearbook photo, years before he was cast as Sylar on Heroes or Spock in Star Trek.\n\nHe has never acknowledged it, but in 2014 he offered this defense of Renee Zellweger when she was getting criticized for alleged plastic surgery: \"Who’s not getting work done? Who’s not trying to bend to the unrealistic expectations of women when they’re young, let alone when they’re older? I thought she did it in a really bold and beautiful way. I think she looks amazing and if she’s happy, then shut the fuck up, everybody.”\n\nThe Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco happily admits to getting plastic surgery: “Years ago, I had my nose done. And my boobs — best thing I ever did. As much as you want to love your inner self … I’m sorry, you also want to look good. I don’t think you should do it for a man or anyone else, but if it makes you feel confident, that’s amazing.”\n\nTyra Banks admitted in her 2018 book Perfect is Boring that she had a nose job early in her modeling career, calling it \"cosmetic-slash-medical\" to fix damage done when she broke her nose when she was three years old.\n\n\"Natural beauty is unfair. I get really uncomfortable when women who are these natural beauties judge anybody who does anything to themselves...Fix it or flaunt it—I think women should be able to do both. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.\"\n\nBlake Lively's rep says once claimed it's \"100% not true\" that she had her nose done. But it was noticeably wider when she starred in the first Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants film in 2005.\n\nPatrick Dempsey was often typecast as a nerd until he apparently had his nose trimmed down and became McDreamy. He hasn't confirmed or denied it.\n\nGrainy yearbook photos are all the evidence that remain of the honker Lisa Kudrow once possessed, but she is happy to confirm that she had her nose done when she was just 16: \"I went from, in my mind, hideous to not hideous. I did it the summer before going to a new high school, so there were plenty of people in my new school who didn't know how hideous I looked before. That was a good, good, good change.\"\n\nNine years after The Mickey Mouse Club, Ryan Gosling catapulted to the A-list with his role in The Notebook. He has never confirmed or denied that his rise to romantic leading man was aided by a scalpel, but there has been speculation for years that he had his nose (and possibly his chin) reshaped.\n\nAlthough she doesn't admit to any plastic surgery, Megan Fox allegedly had a bump removed from the bridge of her nose around the time of the first Transformers film.\n\nBella Hadid continues to insist that her model good looks are completely natural and that she has merely \"grown into\" her features, but there's no doubt that she looked very different just a few years ago.\n\nSOURCES: 123456\n\nHave you ever had (or would you like to have) cosmetic surgery, ONTD?\n\n↧\n\nONTD Original: Summers of Early 2000's R&B\n\nForget Summer of Love '67, summers of early 2000's r&b was an era, a sound, and a look within itself. It was all jerseys, large rimless sunglasses, sheer #lipgloss, baggy clothes and bandanas galore. And everything sounded like Pharrell, Jermaine Dupri, Ja Rule and queen Ashanti.\n\nThis list is a little spin-off to Rap Songs Saved by Female Hooks with a couple of songs carried over. I wanted this list to have music videos with at least a beach setting, and I couldn't help but repeating a few artists. I know we're a few weeks away from the beginning of summer, but the heat is already here.\n\nHere are 15 rap and r&b songs to request at ya summer parties and barbecues.\n\n15.
