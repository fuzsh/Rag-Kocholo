        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - \"Grace Unplugged,\" a movie filmed mostly in Alabama last year, opened at 511 theaters nationwide on Oct. 4 and grossed $1,045,000 during its opening weekend, according to Boxofficemojo.com, a web site that tracks movie box office receipts.\n\nIt was the 15th highest-grossing movie of the weekend, while playing on fewer screens than most of the movies showing.\n\nThe movie fits a trend of low-budget but profitable feature dramas made with a Christian perspective, such as ''Fireproof'' and ''Courageous.'' The movies have a Christian message but are meant to be broadly entertaining.\n\n''It's a growing genre that has found a receptive market,'' said ''Grace Unplugged'' producer Chris Zarpas, former vice president of production for Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney and former CEO of Scott Free, the production company of directors Ridley Scott (''Gladiator'') and the late Tony Scott (''Top Gun'').\n\nZarpas said ''Grace Unplugged'' was filmed with a budget of less than $2 million. It was distributed by Lionsgate.\n\n\"Grace Unplugged\" features Birmingham prominently throughout the movie, even in scenes where it doubles as Los Angeles, where the rest of the movie was filmed.\n\nThe opening scenes were filmed at Liberty Park Baptist Church, as the movie announces onscreen that the setting is Birmingham, Alabama. The church is a recurring setting.\n\nHomewood Park, Dreamcakes, the Rick and Bubba Show and The Edge movie theater also make appearances in the movie. WorkPlay doubles as a nightclub in Los Angeles.\n\nOne scene was shot at The Club, with an overview of the city lights of Birmingham doubling as Los Angeles. The Alabama Theatre appears as itself, hosting a concert during the final scene, with the marquee on Third Avenue North shown prominently. That scene required 2,000 extras in the audience. Filming started in mid-August of 2012 in Birmingham and wrapped up on Sept. 7, 2012.\n\n\"Grace Unplugged\" stars A.J. Michalka as the daughter of a worship minister played by James Denton, of \"Desperate Housewives\" fame. Michalka plays the character Grace Trey, a teen church singer who strikes out on her own to land a record deal in Los Angeles. She cuts off contact with her parents, including her father, a former rock star turned worship leader at a small town Alabama church.\n\n''As soon as I read this, I felt Grace was a part of who I am,'' Michalka said. ''I connected with her immediately when I read the script.\"\n\nMichalka, 22, has appeared in the movies ''Secretariat,'' ''Super 8,'' ''The Lovely Bones'' and ''Jesus in Cowboy Boots.'' She sings in the group 78 Violet with her sister, Aly Michalka. The sisters previously performed as Aly and AJ and were featured stars on the Disney Channel. ''We grew up singing in church, leading worship,'' Michalka said. ''That's how I started. I feel like I'm back in church.'' Both Michalka and Denton sing and play guitar in the movie. Denton, who was a worship leader at a church before he became a professional actor and a star on ''Desperate Housewives,'' plays Johnny Trey. Denton grew up in Goodlettsville, Tenn., and after college in 1986-87 he was minister of music at Westmoreland United Methodist Church in Westmoreland, Tenn. He later worked at a Christian radio station before going into community theater in Chicago, where he was discovered and became a television actor. Denton said he was raised Southern Baptist and remains a committed Christian.\n\nThat's why he wanted to be involved in the project, which explores Christian themes and focuses on the father-daughter relationship. \"We all just fell in love with the script,\" Denton said. \"It stands alone without having to be called a Christian movie.\"\n\nThe cast includes veteran comedian and character actor Kevin Pollak, Michael Welch from the \"Twilight\" movies, and Shawnee Smith, who stars in the FX show ''Anger Management'' with Charlie Sheen.\n\nTrussville Cinema 16, Patton Creek 15 in Hoover, Summit 16, AmStar Stadium 14 in Alabaster and Lee Branch 15 in Birmingham; along with Valley Bend Stadium 18 in Huntsville, AMC Festival Plaza 16 in Montgomery, Hollywood 16 Cinemas in Tuscaloosa and Wynnsong 16 in Mobile were among the\n\nshowing the movie.\n\nï»¿\n\nFor more news on Christian movies made in Alabama, see these stories on AL.com:"
