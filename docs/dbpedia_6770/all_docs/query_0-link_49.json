        "text": "It was hard to draw the both in the beginning associating them for someone else, similar in shape. First, I drew Aly starting out with the same round heart shape, round and wide, almost completely round, but more like Geena Davis.\n\nAs you can see they have a very similar shape and they both even have a mole on their cheek too. So, when I figured out to draw her shape slightly rounder rather than wider I was able to draw Aly.\n\nNext, I drew AJ for the first time and ended up with either Amanda Seyfried or people similar to her whether it was Emma Stone or Michelle Pfeiffer. Then when much closer, but slightly wider in shape of Scarlett Pomers.\n\nSee the similarity…\n\nFinally…\n\nOnce I figured out differing her, AJ’s shape is much longer than them and her sister, I was able to draw her. It was definitly a challange at first drawing two people, related in real life, somewhat similar to each other. It was especially difficult to draw their teeth and contour. Now, since I figure the shape of fhe face, I can contour, draw the body pretty well to the shape. I darkened it best I could. This is an old pic of them, one of the first pic of them in BOP magazine during their first album release, when Aly was on Disney Channel in Phil of the Future. The teeth were most difficult and using the medium used throughout, being technical pencil, I carefully filled in the gaps. I started to draw Emma Stone’s similar shape, but within the teeth. Just with the teeth it started looking like Emma Stone, so I made the shape of teeth longer shaped like her shape of face, finished darkened the whole face of both.\n\nThey are sisters, but Aly has a much wider, almost completely round shape (round heart) while AJ has a much longer, flatter long heart shape. I carefully tried not to associate the two together while drawing or individually drawing them similar someone else in shape. The configuration of shape, the outline are seen for both. I wish the teeth were more definite. But, I am afraid to mess with the shape of teeth in Aly’s. So, I left them. Also the logo came out pretty good and my signature is bottom right. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have enjoyed drawing it from the original. I can draw them without a visual now, knowing their shape, identifying them, drawing them both exactly as themselves Aly and AJ.\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere are a few drawings of Alyson Michalka by herself…\n\nTechnical pencil makes such a difference, identified, distinct in shape of face.\n\nHere is the original…\n\nI start to look at the eyes, which almost look demented, crossed eyed, or not the same expression, but it is. Because the eyes are unfinished and they are shaded funny, it looks funny. However looking at the whole eye shape, not just how it is looking, how it looks within the eye, the unfinished part, you can see Aly is looking the same exact way, same expression. Also, at a diagonal position, perspective, it is even harder to draw the eyes because they are looking in the same direction the body is face, diagonal, but when looking at the camera straight away, so if not drawn right, in the direction they are looking, they end up looking funny. I found that drawing my Buffy the Vampire Slayer drawing, not found on the detail page, previous to this one. But, can be found on my blog. Anyway, the teeth were the hardest to draw. Still I thought, shaped like the shape of face Round Heart:round and wide. Also, I used a technical pencil too. The body was the most difficult part, also formed the same way. Also, the angle of her body slightly turned almost makes her look aneroxic, no arms, but just enough. Once I got the body to appear turned more at an angle, the arms appeared just enough in form.. The hardest part was the body being shoulders, arm and position waste was turned from neck to above the waste.\n\nHere is the original…\n\nThe scanner liked these two shaped eyes. Funny enough, are beneficial in this case. You can see her shape is very round and wide, almost completely round, but somewhat heart shaped:round + heart=round heart as seen here. But wait the features are shaded, with a not as bold, crisp outline. They are like that purpose, because the lighting of the picture leaves the shape of her eyes, nose, lips, slightly overexposed, you can’t see the usual blunt outline. However, if you look at one feature up close whether being eye, nose or mouth (in this case eye shape, left and right), are both shaped the same way as the face. They may not have the bold lined but are formed according to shape of face. If it wasn’t for face, the eye shape would be someone else’s different, similar shape instead of Aly’s, resulting in someone else completely different unintentional. So, that is a good reason to figure out configuration of shape of face before drawing, because details start to fade, lose shape and almost appear indefinite in formation, like the eyes shape seen here. Whereas the outline of shape of face is more defninite.\n\nHowever, you can still tell it is her because the eyes are formed like the shape of her eyes, her face:round & wide, still it needs a more bolder outline like the face seen here, seeming to define every feature within it. As I find, does for every person. Especially in this case, the shape definitely makes the structure.\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere are some more of the talented duo, recently known as the new band, 78 Violet…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nCan you guess who’s lip it is? Two hints: The shape-is round and very wide. Also, it is a closeup of the previous drawing. I saw the scanner automatically cropped this. I was thinking, it couldn’t be AJ’s mouth shape, because hers is much longer and flatter, while this lip shape is not, much rounder and wider-like Aly’s…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nI drew the arm not included in the original picture. Drawing shapes, proportion of face makes it easier to draw the body more proportionate as well. I can tell with the arm will extend, fall, reach out and end. However, I can telll Aly’s arm is too short. Her contour as well as length of her face shape is very long. So, I will go back and edit that little part. But, you can tell who both of them are with the definite face shape: Aly’s being round heart shaped and AJ”s being much longer, flatter slightly round on bottom shape. Or, what I like to refer to as, “Long heart shape”.\n\nHere is the original image\n\nI will provide the original when I find it.\n\nAJ Michalka\n\nHere is a quick sketched version, still in more detail-notice the detailed open mouth with shape of teeth?\n\nHere is the original image\n\nThis one above was really small, but easy to draw because the mouth was barely open-less teeth to draw here.\n\nHere is the original image…\n\nHere is one with some sidenotes saying, “FEC”, standing for Fix Eye Contact. Looking back, it is direct like the photo, so I can go back and erase that. But, it helps to have notes because after intricate details, little once can be sacrificed, from being left unnoticed.\n\nHere is the original image…\n\nThis one, almost associated for people someowhat similar-it almost starts to look ike Emma Stone with a slightly rounder face and shape of teeth. I always thought AJ in the movie Cow Belles reminded me of a blonde Emma Stone, Mila Kunis. So, I almost drew her in here. But knowing the shape, prevented that normally inevitable issue-therefore can be avoided. Notice the more definite formation around the face, confirming the shape is more elongated and flatter like AJ’s rather than a heart shape, appearing much more oval like Emma’s?…\n\nHere is the original…\n\nHere is the most recent original (Link is coming soon)\n\nAlso if necessary, I will be back for more elaboration. Thanks for visiting, enjoy the visual and let me know what you think…\n\nBack\n\nAbout keh1016\n\nI am going to Greenville Tech, majoring in Design, have thought and studied technical, analytical, full-proof methods/techniques for 20 years on the subject and consider every angle before publishing my posts. Then, utilize them in a fun, personal way using engaging activities critical thinking, up close and personal level on the subject-even using my own pictures for a comparison, on the subject of faces. Face it-when it comes to drawing the people, study compare and draw or utilize in a different way. Hey, use it or lose it right? Also, you can contact me via comment or the tumblr page available on the bottom menu. Thanks for visiting.\n\n*\n\nposted on\n\nby keh1016\n\nfiled under Uncategorized"
