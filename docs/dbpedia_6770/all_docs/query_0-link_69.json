        "text": "There are so many celeb siblings that call themselves best friends! I've always thought, if you have a sister or brother around, you've got a friend for life. There's an unbreakable bond between sisters and brothers - you can count on them no matter what. These celeb siblings recognize that bond because they're always having fun with each other and supporting each other through it all!\n\nSnapshot Survey\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\nPlease subscribe for your personalized newsletter:\n\nEmail address\n\n1.

Vanessa & Stella Hudgens\n\nVanessa is always bringing her little sis Stella as her date to red carpet events.

In that industry, it's definitely important to have a best friend you can trust!\n\n4.
