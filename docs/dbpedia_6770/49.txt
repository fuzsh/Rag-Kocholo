About

Born March 25, 1989, Aly Michalka showed an interest for acting at a young age, appearing in theater productions put on by local churches at the age of 5.

After two years of auditioning for different parts, Michalka landed the role of Keely Teslow on the Disney Channel show Phil of the Future. The show became a hit, and Michalka was able to pursue a singing career through Disney as well. She recorded songs for Herbie: Fully Loaded and Ice Princess.

Michalka and her younger sister AJ also make up the band duo 78violet (formerly known as Aly & AJ). They released their debut album, Into the Rush, in 2005. Their second album, Insomniatic, debuted at No. 15 and their single, “Potential Breakup Song,” went platinum.

In 2010, Michalka starred in the CW series Hellcats with fellow Disney star Ashley Tisdale. The show was canceled after one season.
