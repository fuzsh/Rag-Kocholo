        "text": "All Blacks coach Scott Robertson has named his first side of the season with Blues fullback Stephen Perofeta getting the nod over veteran Beauden Barrett at fullback to face England in Dunedin on Saturday.\n\nBarrett will come off the bench for his first top level action at home this year following a season in Japan. TJ Perenara returns to test level after a two-year break and will start at halfback with Damian McKenzie in the 10 jersey outside of him. Samipeni Finau joins Dalton Papali’i and Ardie Savea, also returning from Japan, in the loose forward trio.\n\nScott Barrett will captain the All Blacks for the first time, paired up with winning Blues skipper Patrick Tuipulotu in the locks. Mark Tele’a and Sevu Reece will start on the wing.\n\nAny thoughts of Crusaders bias from the multi-Super Rugby winning coach can brushed aside with the omission of Ethan Blackadder, with Luke Jacobson on the bench taking his likely place in the squad.\n\n“This was a very tough squad to pick, but we’ve selected the best 23 players to beat England on Saturday,” Robertson said. “There is a lot of excitement in the group for our first test and we’re walking together toward this opportunity to represent New Zealand and our families in Dunedin in front of a sold out stadium. We’ve prepared well and we’re ready.”\n\nThe All Blacks squad has a collective 934 test caps in total with none of five new caps in the series squad named in the match-day 23 meaning no debutants this weekend.\n\nA dynamic reserve bench is a mix of youthful energy and experience with backs Anton Lienert-Brown and Beauden Barrett bringing a combined 193 test caps to the squad.\n\nPerenara and Reece have both overcome serious injury setbacks to earn their respective places in the starting lineup.\n\nAt 32-years-old, Perenara is set to play his first test in nearly two years after rupturing his Achilles during the All Blacks 25-25 draw with England in London in 2022. Reece, who was Super Rugby Pacific’s top try scorer this year, is also in line to play his first Test since 2022, after missing most of the 2023 season when he ruptured his ACL playing for the Crusaders.\n\nPerofeta is in line to add to his three test caps after being named at fullback, in what will also be his first test cap since 2022, when he came off the bench against Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nFinau has been named to wear the No.6 jersey for what would be his second test after debuting at Forsyth Barr Stadium in 2023 where he scored a try during the All Blacks dramatic 23-20 Bledisloe Cup win over Australia.\n\nThe opening match of the All Blacks 2024 test season will mark the eleventh time the All Blacks and England have contested the Hillary Shield, which was introduced in 2008 to honour the legacy of Sir Edmund Hillary, and to recognise the links between the two countries.\n\nAll Blacks match-day 23 (Test caps in brackets)\n\n1.
