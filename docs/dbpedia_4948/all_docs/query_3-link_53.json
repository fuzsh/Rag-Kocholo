        "text": "There is now less than one month to go until the summer transfer window closes.\n\nIt opened on Friday 14 June and 19 of the Premier League’s 20 teams have used the opportunity to strengthen their squad, with Liverpool the one exception and only club yet to make a signing.\n\nHere we look at what business each of the clubs have done so far and what could still happen before the window slams shut on 30 August.\n\nSee: Every transfer completed so far\n\nArsenal\n\nMajor ins: David Raya (Brentford), Tommy Setford (Ajax), Riccardo Calafiori (Bologna)\n\nMajor outs: Mohamed Elneny, Cedric Soares (both released), Albert Sambi Lokonga (Sevilla - loan), Nuno Tavares (Lazio - loan)\n\nAfter finishing just two points behind champions Manchester City, only a few small tweaks are required to Mikel Arteta’s squad, allowing them to adopt a patient approach to this transfer window.\n\nDavid Raya’s loan move from Brentford has become permanent, as expected, and young goalkeeper Tommy Setford has also been brought in.\n\nThe arrival of versatile defender Riccardo Calafiori will give them another left-sided option, with left-back one area they had selection issues last season.\n\nWork is ongoing to strengthen other areas such as central midfield. “Things are happening in the background,” with outgoings too, Arteta confirmed. Emile Smith Rowe, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah are among those who have been attracting interest, with Smith Rowe reportedly close to sealing a move to Fulham, while Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares have been loaned out.\n\nAston Villa\n\nMajor ins: Lewis Dobbin (Everton), Ian Maatsen (Chelsea), Enzo Barrenechea, Samuel Iling-Junior (both Juventus), Ross Barkley (Luton Town), Cameron Archer (Sheffield United), Jaden Philogene (Hull City), Amadou Onana (Everton)\n\nMajor outs: Tim Iroegbunam (Everton), Omari Kellyman (Chelsea), Douglas Luiz (Juventus), Philippe Coutinho (Vasco da Gama - loan), Calum Chambers (Cardiff - free), Moussa Diaby (Al Ittihad)\n\nAhead of a big season featuring their first ever foray into the UEFA Champions League, Villa have been busy overhauling their squad. Eight players have already arrived to improve Villa’s depth for the increased demands ahead.\n\nHaving lost defensive lynchpin Douglas Luiz to Juventus, a reported club record £50million has been spent on the Brazilian's main replacement in Amadou Onana, with Ross Barkley and Enzo Barrenechea also arriving to bolster Aston Villa’s midfield.\n\nAcademy graduates Jaden Philogene and Cameron Archer have returned to add to Unai Emery's attacking options along with Samuel Iling-Junior and Lewis Dobbin, while Ian Maatsen is a further versatile addition, particularly down the left.\n\nAlong with Douglas Luiz, the sales of Tim Iroegbunam, Omari Kellyman and Moussa Diaby have helped facilitate all the incomings.\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n\nMajor ins: Luis Sinisterra (Leeds), Enes Unal (Getafe), Alex Paulsen (Wellington Phoenix), Daniel Jebbison (Sheffield United), Dean Huijsen (Juventus)\n\nMajor outs: Ryan Fredericks, Darren Randolph, Jamal Lowe (all released) Lloyd Kelly (Newcastle - free), Kieffer Moore (Sheffield United), Joe Rothwell (Leeds - loan)\n\nBournemouth have been quietly bolstering their squad as they look to build on their best ever Premier League points tally of 48. Two players who were already on their books, Luis Sinisterra and Enes Unal, have seen their moves become permanent this summer.\n\nThree young hopefuls, goalkeeper Alex Paulsen, striker Daniel Jebbison and defender Dean Huijsen, an especially promising addition, have also joined Andoni Iraola’s squad.\n\nMore importantly they have managed to keep hold of their best players, including last season's top scorer Dominic Solanke.\n\nBrentford\n\nMajor ins: Igor Thiago (Club Brugge)\n\nMajor outs: David Raya (Arsenal), Neal Maupay, Sergio Reguilon (end of loans), Thomas Strakosha (AEK Athens - free), Saman Ghoddos (released)\n\nIvan Toney’s future has been Brentford’s big transfer topic this summer. And how much longer he remains a Brentford player could hinge on the fitness of Igor Thiago.\n\nThe Brazilian striker joined the Bees, who reportedly missed out on Leeds United’s Archie Gray, this summer billed as Toney’s potential successor in a reported club record £30million deal. Two goals on his debut in a pre-season friendly against AFC Wimbledon was a promising glimpse of what may be to come but he suffered a knee injury in the same match, ruling him out until late 2024 after undergoing surgery.\n\nRaya’s departure to Arsenal was confirmed. Neal Maupay and Sergio Reguilon were helpful loanees amid Brentford’s injury issues last season but have now been allowed to return to their parent clubs Everton and Tottenham Hotspur respectively.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n\nMajor ins: Ibrahim Osman (FC Nordsjaelland), Yankuba Minteh (Newcastle), Mats Wieffer (Feyenoord), Amario Cozier-Duberry (Arsenal), Malick Yalcouye (IFK Goteborg)\n\nMajor outs: Adam Lallana (Southampton - free), Steven Alzate (released), Pascal Gross (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nThere has been change at the top, with former head coach Roberto De Zerbi departing and Fabian Hurzeler being appointed as his replacement and the Premier League’s youngest ever permanent manager.\n\nBut the potentially-clever Brighton transfer business and investment in their future has continued. After being hit by injuries in wide areas last season, in particular to Kaoru Mitoma and Solly March, Brighton will have more options in that department, with the additions of exciting youngsters Yankuba Minteh, Amario Cozier-Duberry and Ibrahim Osman.\n\nWith Pascal Gross departing for Borussia Dortmund and interest in Billy Gilmour from Napoli, Brighton have strengthened in central midfield too by signing Mats Wieffer and Malick Yalcouye.\n\nChelsea\n\nMajor ins: Tosin Adarabioyo (Fulham - free), Omari Kellyman (Aston Villa), Marc Guiu (Barcelona), Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester), Renato Veiga (Basel), Caleb Wiley (Atlanta United)\n\nMajor outs: Thiago Silva (Fluminense - free), Hakim Ziyech (Galatasaray), Ian Maatsen (Aston Villa), Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town), Lewis Hall (Newcastle)\n\nWhile not as hectic as some previous windows, there has still been a steady stream of transfer activity at Chelsea. The gap created by Thiago Silva’s departure has been filled by free agent Tosin Adarabioyo, while new head coach Enzo Maresca has added a player already familiar with his methods by bringing midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall with him from Leicester City.\n\nChelsea’s other additions - defender Renato Veiga, 21, attacking midfielder Omari Kellyman, 18, striker Marc Guiu, 18, left-back Caleb Wiley, 19 and goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen, 22 - are in keeping with their youthful transfer policy.\n\nTheir generally deep squad is perhaps only lacking a consistent scorer, something they could look to address in the next month.\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nMajor ins: Chadi Riad (Barcelona), Daichi Kamada (Lazio - free)\n\nMajor outs: Jairo Riedewald, James Tomkins (both released), Michael Olise (Bayern Munich)\n\nWho Palace retain will be as important as who they sign in what is left of this window. They have already lost Michael Olise, the Premier League’s most efficient attacker last season. No player had a better goals and assists return than Olise’s 1.13 per 90 minutes last season. Those qualities will now need replacing.\n\nThey will also be hoping to keep hold of the likes of Marc Guehi, an England standout at UEFA EURO 2024, and Eberechi Eze.\n\nThough they have at least already reinforced in the areas that Guehi and Eze can play by signing defender Chadi Riad and attacking midfielder Daichi Kamada.\n\nEverton\n\nMajor ins: Tim Iroegbunam (Aston Villa), Jack Harrison (Leeds), Iliman Ndiaye (Marseille), Jesper Lindstrom (Napoli), Jake O'Brien (Lyon)\n\nMajor outs: Andre Gomes (released), Lewis Dobbin (Aston Villa), Ben Godfrey (Atalanta), Amadou Onana (Aston Villa)\n\nEverton have successfully managed to add to Sean Dyche’s squad while losing only one key player in Onana to Villa. England youth international Iroegbunam is set to fill the Onana void having moved in the opposite direction, talented forward Iliman Ndiaye will increase their attacking options while giant Irish defender Jake O'Brien has also been prised away from French club Lyon to bolster Dyche's defence.\n\nEverton have made good use of the loan market so far by borrowing winger Jack Harrison again from Leeds United, along with Jesper Lindstrom from Napoli.\n\nFulham\n\nMajor ins: Ryan Sessegnon (free)\n\nMajor outs: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea), Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich), Bobby De Cordova-Reid (free)\n\nThe initial focus for Fulham was on resolving uncertain futures. Adarabioyo’s exit was expected and Bobby De Cordova-Reid departed in similar fashion. Joao Palhinha finally got the move he wanted to Bayern Munich too.\n\nNow Marco Silva can work on reshaping his squad. Palhinha’s move has seen Fulham lose the player with the most tackles in each of his two Premier League seasons, qualities in the defensive midfield area they will need to replace. The rebuild has begun with the return of Ryan Sessegnon on a free transfer after he left Spurs, while Emile Smith Rowe is set to join from Arsenal.\n\nIpswich Town\n\nMajor ins: Omari Hutchinson (Chelsea), Ben Johnson (West Ham - free), Jacob Greaves (Hull), Liam Delap (Manchester City), Arijanet Muric (Burnley), Conor Townsend (West Brom)\n\nMajor outs: Vaclav Hladky (Burnley - free)\n\nIpswich have wasted little time attempting to upgrade their squad with young hungry talent ahead of their Premier League return, with five major arrivals so far.\n\nWinger Omari Hutchison has joined permanently after a successful loan spell. Full-back Ben Johnson was a free transfer capture, with notable sums also spent on centre-back Jacob Greaves, striker Liam Delap and goalkeeper Arijanet Muric.\n\nMuric will replace Ipswich’s No 1 last season Vaclav Hladky, who has ended up going the other way and joining Burnley after leaving Portman Road this summer following the expiry of his contract.\n\nLeicester City\n\nMajor ins: Bobby De Cordova-Reid (Fulham - free), Michael Golding (Chelsea), Caleb Okoli (Atalanta), Abdul Fatawu (Sporting Lisbon)\n\nMajor outs: Marc Albrighton, Kelechi Iheanacho, Dennis Praet (all released), Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Chelsea)\n\nAfter a slow start to their window Leicester’s business did eventually pick up. Managerial uncertainty would have played its part after Maresca was prised away by Chelsea and Steve Cooper eventually named his successor.\n\nDewsbury-Hall’s move gave them some money to play with and moves for midfielder Michael Golding, defender Caleb Okoli and winger Abdul Fatawu - a loanee last season - have duly followed. De Cordova-Reid was also snapped up on a free after leaving Fulham.\n\nLiverpool\n\nMajor ins: None\n\nMajor outs: Thiago Alcantara (retired), Joel Matip (released), Adrian (Real Betis - free)\n\nLiverpool are the only Premier League club yet to add to their squad. Joel Matip and Thiago Alcantara left on free transfers while Liverpool's tail off in the title race last season has underlined the fact there is room for improvement. But new head coach Arne Slot is happy to bide his time and assess what he has inherited.\n\n“The first aim is to work with these players,” said Slot. “The standards are really high when it comes to bringing in new players because we have such a good team and such a good squad. But it would be a surprise for all of us if we don't bring any player in.”\n\nManchester City\n\nMajor ins: Savinho (Troyes)\n\nMajor outs: Sergio Gomez (Real Sociedad), Liam Delap (Ipswich)\n\nIt cannot be easy trying to improve the squad that made it a record four successive Premier League title wins last season. Man City have subsequently only tweaked things so far, just bringing in Brazil winger Savinho.\n\nFringe full-back Sergio Gomez and academy graduate striker Delap have been allowed to move on and any further departures may dictate who arrives in what is left of this window.\n\nManchester United\n\nMajor ins: Joshua Zirkzee (Bologna), Leny Yoro (Lillle)\n\nMajor outs: Anthony Martial, Brandon Williams (released), Raphael Varane (Como - free), Donny van de Beek (Girona - free), Willy Kambwala (Villarreal), Mason Greenwood (Marseille)\n\nThe Old Trafford club’s business up to this point has been significant both in terms of ins and outs. French duo, defender Raphael Varane and forward Anthony Martial, were allowed to leave at the end of their contracts and have been replaced by younger, big-money pair Leny Yoro (for a reported £58.9million) and Joshua Zirkzee (a reported £36.5million).\n\nSales of the likes of Donny van de Beek, Willy Kambwala and Mason Greenwood have brought in fees, and after Man Utd’s disappointing eighth-placed finish last season, the changes are only expected to continue, with manager Erik Ten Hag saying: “We are looking in all the positions to reinforce. We need a plan with the squad to make sure we are occupied in every area.\"\n\nNewcastle United\n\nMajor ins: Lloyd Kelly (Bournemouth), Odysseas Vlachodimos (Nottingham Forest), Lewis Hall (Chelsea), John Ruddy (Birmingham)\n\nMajor outs: Paul Dummett, Matt Ritchie, Loris Karius, Jeff Hendrick (all released), Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Yankuba Minteh (Brighton)\n\nNewcastle’s first priority was to balance the books and the sales of Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh, reportedly for a combined £65million, helped them do that.\n\nNewcastle shipped 29 more league goals last season than in the previous campaign and injury issues at the back were a big reason why. Sven Botman is out long term with a knee injury but the arrival of fellow left-sided centre-back Lloyd Kelly should now give them cover.\n\nGoalkeeper Nick Pope was also a big miss but that department has been strengthened too with the arrivals of Odysseas Vlachodimos and the experienced John Ruddy. Lewis Hall’s loan from Chelsea has become a permanent move while keeping hold of the likes of Bruno Guimaraes and Alexander Isak has been important too.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nMajor ins: Elliot Anderson (Newcastle), Carlos Miguel (Corinthians), Nikola Milenkovic (Fiorentina), Shae Cahill (Brisbane Roar), Jota Silva (Vitoria de Guimaraes)\n\nMajor outs: Orel Mangala, Noussa Niakhate (both Lyon), Odysseas Vlachodimos (Newcastle), Felipe, Cheikhou Kouyate, Wayne Hennessy, Scott McKenna (all released), Gio Reyna, Nuno Tavares, Gonzalo Montiel, Divock Origi (end of loans)\n\nBusy transfer windows are nothing new at Forest and this has been no different. A string of players have been loaned or released, Orel Mangala and Moussa Niakhate sold to Lyon and Vlachodimos to Newcastle.\n\nThey have welcomed a number of new faces too including midfielder Anderson, giant 6ft 8in goalkeeper Carlos Miguel and experienced Serbian centre-back Nikola Milenkovic, who could prove to be a shrewd purchase. Former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill’s son Shae could also be a name to keep an eye out for in the future.\n\nSouthampton\n\nMajor ins: Adam Lallana (Brighton), Taylor Harwood-Bellis (Man City), Charlie Taylor (Burnley), Ronnie Edwards (Peterborough), Nathan Wood (Swansea), Yukinari Sugawara (AZ Alkmaar), Flynn Downes (West Ham), Ben Brereton Diaz (Villarreal).\n\nMajor outs: Stuart Armstrong (released), Che Adams (Torino - free).\n\nSouthampton’s determination to avoid a repeat of their previous Premier League campaign, which ended in relegation, is underlined by their squad strengthening efforts already. They have been quick off the mark and one of busiest clubs this summer, making eight major and immediate additions. And there are a couple of recurring themes in what they have done so far.\n\nPrevious experience in English football seems key, with only Yukinari Sugawara having never experienced it before. Five of the new faces are also defenders indicating an area considered a priority for reinforcing by manager Russell Martin.\n\nChe Adams has been a headline free transfer departure and improving in attack is on Martin’s to-do list before the window closes. The capture of striker Ben Brereton Diaz from Villarreal is a promising start.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nMajor ins: Timo Werner (RB Leipzig), Lucas Bergvall (Djurgarden), Archie Gray (Leeds), Yang Min-Hyeok (Gangwon)\n\nMajor outs: Eric Dier (Bayern Munich - free), Ivan Perisic (Hadjuk Split - free), Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham - free), Japhet Tanganga (Millwall - free), Tanguy Ndombele (released), Joe Rodon (Leeds), Troy Parrott (AZ Alkmaar), Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Marseille)\n\nFarewells have been said to some notable names, even if some were no longer big contributors, giving Ange Postecoglou the chance to reshape his squad.\n\nRecord-signing Tanguy Ndombele had his contract terminated, Eric Dier, Ivan Perisic and Sessegnon were among those let go, while Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s time at Spurs was brought to an end, initially with a loan move to Marseille.\n\nThe future seems to be a big focus for Spurs, with 18-year-olds Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Yang Min-Hyeok all signed. Timo Werner has also been handed another chance to impress after injury cut short his loan spell last season.\n\nWest Ham United\n\nMajor ins: Luis Guilherme (Palmeiras), Wes Foderingham (Sheffield United - free), Maximilian Kilman (Wolves)\n\nMajor outs: Thilo Kehrer (Monaco), Angelo Ogbonna (released), Ben Johnson (Ipswich - free), Said Benrahma (Lyon), Flynn Downes (Southampton)\n\nThis has been a mixed window so far for West Ham. Exciting Brazilian winger Luis Guilherme has been recruited, Maximilian Kilman reunited with his former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Julen Lopetegui and Wes Foderingham brought in to bolster the goalkeeping department.\n\nBut they have been thwarted in attempts to improve elsewhere, having shown interest in the likes of defensive duo Jean-Clair Todibo, of Nice, and Bayern Munich's Noussair Mazraoui.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nMajor ins: Tommy Doyle (Man City), Rodrigo Gomes (Braga), Jorgen Strand Larsen (Celta Vigo), Pedro Lima (Sport Recife)\n\nMajor outs: Maximilian Kilman (West Ham)\n\nThe loss of their captain and centre-back Kilman has left Wolves with a big hole to fill. Not least because Kilman was one of just two outfielders to play every single Premier League minute last season."
