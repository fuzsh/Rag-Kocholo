        "text": "On Sunday, October 20, 2019, William Charles Scott, loving husband. father, grandpa, bumpa great grampa, and friend passed away at home at the age of 82.\n\n“Bill” as he was known to his friends and family lived an amazingly full, giving and happy life. He lived his life one day at a time and his glass was always half full. Born in Guelph in 1936 Bill made Guelph his lifelong home until his death and became part of the fabric of Guelph and the community he loved. Coach, teacher, vice principal, principal and finally superintendent were roles Bill loved and many he taught, mentored and worked with became integral parts of his life before and after retirement. His need and want to contribute to his community took on many roles but he truly loved being a part of the Rotarian community and found his involvement with Hospice Wellington very fulfilling.\n\nBill cherished his family and he will be very missed by all who loved him. He has left unforgettable memories with his loving wife and best friend of 61 years Donna (Churcher), daughter Johnna Clapperton (Peter), Biviano grandchildren Joel (Nicole), Hannah, Aaron and Sam, Clapperton grandchildren Zachary (Hayley), Jacob (Brianne and great granddaughter Avery) and Rees (Joshua) as well as his Scott family including big brother Jim (deceased) and his wife Yoli, sister Patti (Greg), and all of his many nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his daughter Judy and son Taylor whom he loved dearly.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday the 26th of October, 2019, at Trinity United Church, 400 Stevenson St. N., Guelph, Ontario. A reception will follow in the church auditorium. Arrangements entrusted to the WALL-CUSTANCE FUNERAL HOME & CHAPEL, 519-822-0051.\n\nIn lieu of flowers Donna and her family have asked that donations be made to Hospice Wellington."
