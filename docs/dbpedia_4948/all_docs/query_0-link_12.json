        "text": "Bill Scott was a lifelong Guelphite with a passion for sports, education and helping others.\n\nScott grew up playing hockey, baseball and football, all at competitive levels. He was known as a coachable and dependable athlete, which then translated into his ability to be a dedicated coach in his later years.\n\nScott studied at McMaster University and decided to pursue a career in education, where he was instrumental in providing counselling and direction to all of his students.\n\nHis roles as a secondary school teacher, vice principal and principal with the Wellington County School Board gave him the opportunity to keep sports in his life and coach young athletes. Scott was the senior football coach at John Ross Collegiate and Vocational School, where he also taught physical education, history and geography.\n\nLike all great leaders, he was a listener with tremendous empathy towards his colleagues, parents, staff and students.\n\nIn his role as a coach, he demonstrated skills of leadership, mentorship and insight. He taught the disciplines of the game on the field and in the classroom and instilled the finer skills of the sport to his students: how to be a worthy winner and a gracious loser. These lessons helped his students to become future leaders in their own lives.\n\nAfter years of serving as a vice principal and principal, he was promoted to superintendent of schools for the Wellington County School Board.\n\nScott’s numerous contributions make him an admirable recipient of this year’s Legacy award.\n\n“He was a phenomenal individual in the community and was very well respected,” said Warren Gregg, Scott’s neighbour and longtime friend. “When he passed away, it was the largest funeral to ever be held at Trinity United Church.”\n\n“He is a worthy winner of this award. I’m really glad that he was selected,” Gregg added.\n\nIn addition to his educational and athletic responsibilities, Scott also made a commitment to giving back to his community. He held leadership positions with Arc Industries, Guelph General Hospital, Hospice Wellington, Alumnae Association of McMaster University, YMCA and The Sunrise Equestrian Centre.\n\nFrom his retirement to his passing in 2019, he was a dedicated volunteer and made a major contribution to the Rotary Club of Guelph as chair. As a result, he earned the title of “Rotarian for Life”.\n\nScott made a lasting impression throughout the Guelph community during his life and will continue to be missed by many.\n\nThe Legacy Award is awarded posthumously to an individual who has created lasting change and measurable difference in our community through commitment and perseverance. This award pays tribute to an individual’s professional, social or cultural leadership, and vision, and his or her ongoing legacy.\n\nThank you to the friends and family of Bill Scott who are keeping his memory alive and have graciously accepted this award on his behalf.\n\nThis award is proudly sponsored by Gilbert MacIntyre and Son Funeral Homes."
