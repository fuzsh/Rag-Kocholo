        "text": "​​​\n\nJacksonville University's President's Parents Council (PPC) is an important group that serves as a liaison between campus administrators and the parent body. President’s Parents Council members serve as representatives in their geographic area to prospective Jacksonville University students and families and make future Dolphins feel welcomed into the JU Family. Members of the Council support the University by making annual gifts at the Order of the Dolphin level or one of its giving societies. Members receive direct access to the President and executive staff, and provide the University with direction by studying issues, offering guidance, and acting as liaisons to administration on key issues for our campus and in higher education.​​\n\nView President's Parents Council Highlight Photos\n\nFrom the President's Parents Council\n\nClass of 2027 Family Letter\n\nby Shane and Janny Sims P'24\n\nHelping Your Child Manage Stress\n\nby Nancy Gilreath P'22 and Loren Rutulante P'21, P'23\n\nDecember 2019 Parent E-Newsletter\n\nGet Involved\n\nThe President's Parents Council is comprised of approximately 30+ families who have been invited to serve as a liaison between campus administrators and the parent body.
