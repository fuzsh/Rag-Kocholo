        "text": "Football writer Alex Keble assesses each Premier League club and their prospects for the 2024/25 season.\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n\nAndoni Iraola pulled off a miracle last season, and there is good reason to believe he’ll perform another this season.\n\nTaking AFC Bournemouth to their highest-ever Premier League points total of 48, with a 12th-place finish, was pretty extraordinary considering he radically altered their tactics in the process and failed to win any of his first nine matches.\n\nBut it gets better. Iraola managed all of that despite his 2023 summer signings Alex Scott, Tyler Adams, Hamed Traore and Romain Faivre accruing a meagre 13 league starts between them.\n\nThose injuries have now cleared up, and another summer of tactical training diminishes the likelihood of a slow start. In other words, incredibly, Bournemouth fans can expect an even better 2024/25 season.\n\nPerformance last season\n\nFA Cup: Fifth round\n\nEFL Cup: Fourth round\n\nLast five seasons\n\nSeason League position 2019/20 18th 2020/21 6th (Championship) 2021/22 2nd (Championship) 2022/23 15th 2023/24 12th\n\nBest Premier League finish\n\nNinth: 2016/17\n\nSee: More about Bournemouth's history\n\nSeason aims\n\nOnly once have Bournemouth managed a top-10 finish in the Premier League but that is a realistic goal for the season. Iraola’s side fell just one point short last campaign.\n\nIntegrating Adams, Faivre, Traore and Scott on a regular basis should mean no more heavy losing streaks, perhaps even bringing European qualification into play as a target. Eighth place might be enough for that; an improbable outcome but something to aim for.\n\nKey transfers\n\nLosing last season's top goalscorer Dominic Solanke to Tottenham Hotspur is a huge blow.\n\nThere are plenty of players who arrived last summer and are just now settling in, ready to take to the field \"like new signings\", as the cliché goes.\n\nBournemouth's key transfers so far\n\nPlayer Transfer Type Club Luis Sinisterra Transfer In Leeds United Enes Unal Transfer In Getafe Alex Paulsen Transfer In Wellington Phoenix Lloyd Kelly Released - Kieffer Moore Transfer Out Sheffield United Dean Huijsen Transfer In Juventus Dominic Solanke Transfer Out Tottenham Hotspur\n\nSee: Clubs' summer 2024 transfers\n\nTactics\n\nIraola has introduced a fast and direct playing style befitting a club of Bournemouth’s stature. Thanks to long days perfecting moves on the training pitch, blistering counter-attacks and well-choreographed pressing traps make Bournemouth one of the division’s best at attacking transitions.\n\nInjury report\n\nPlayer Injury Latest Update Tyler Adams Back - Enes Unal Foot - David Brooks Shoulder -\n\nSee: Latest injuries and news\n\nPre-season results and fixtures\n\n21 July AFC Bournemouth 1-1 WrexhamReport\n\n25 July Arsenal 1-1 AFC Bournemouth (Arsenal win 5-4 on pens)Reaction\n\n4 Aug AFC Bournemouth 1-0 Rayo VallecanoReport\n\n10 Aug v Girona (Vitality Stadium) Details\n\nWhat the manager says\n\nAndoni Iraola: “I think we have to continue improving the team, continue improving collectively, continue growing the different players individually. I don’t believe a lot in long-term goals. In the end, this changes every week. Now it’s going to be different. We can see teams are improving, signing very good players. Everyone is going to be better, so we have to be there also.”\n\nBest XI (4-2-3-1)\n\nNeto; Max Aarons, Marcos Senesi, Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez; Alex Scott, Tyler Adams; Antoine Semenyo, Ryan Christie, Justin Kluivert; Enes Unal\n\nOpening PL fixtures\n\nKits\n\nSee: More details at AFC Bournemouth's online store\n\nWhere will they finish?"
