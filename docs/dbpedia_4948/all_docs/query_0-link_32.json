        "text": "The squad selected by All Blacks Head Coach Scott Robertson and his four assistant coaches Scott Hansen, Jason Holland, Leon MacDonald and Jason Ryan, will play two Tests against England in Dunedin and Auckland, and one against Fiji in San Diego.\n\nThe 32-strong Steinlager Ultra Low Carb Series squad is as follows: (age, Super Rugby club, province, Test caps)\n\n* denotes new cap\n\nForwards (18)\n\nHookers\n\nAsafo Aumua (27 / Hurricanes / Wellington / 6)\n\nCodie Taylor (33 / Crusaders / Canterbury / 85)\n\nGeorge Bell* (22 / Crusaders / Canterbury / 0)\n\nProps\n\nEthan De Groot (25 / Highlanders / Southland / 22)\n\nTyrel Lomax (28 / Hurricanes / Tasman / 32)\n\nFletcher Newell (24 / Crusaders / Canterbury / 13)\n\nPasilio Tosi* (25 / Hurricanes / Bay of Plenty / 0)\n\nOfa Tu’ungafasi (32 / Blues / Northland / 57)\n\nTamaiti Williams (23 / Crusaders / Canterbury / 7)\n\nLocks\n\nScott Barrett (30 / Crusaders / Taranaki / 69) (Captain)\n\nTupou Vaa’i (24 / Chiefs / Taranaki / 25)\n\nPatrick Tuipulotu (31 / Blues / Auckland / 43)\n\nLoose Forwards\n\nEthan Blackadder (29 / Crusaders / Tasman / 10)\n\nSamipeni Finau (25 / Chiefs / Waikato / 1)\n\nLuke Jacobson (27 / Chiefs / Waikato / 18)\n\nDalton Papali’i (26 / Blues / Counties Manukau / 32)\n\nArdie Savea (30 / Hurricanes / Wellington / 81) (Vice Captain)\n\nWallace Sititi* (21 / Chiefs / North Harbour / 0)\n\nBacks (14)\n\nHalfbacks\n\nFinlay Christie (28 / Blues / Tasman / 21)\n\nTJ Perenara (32 / Hurricanes / Wellington / 80)\n\nCortez Ratima* (23 / Chiefs / Waikato / 0)\n\nFirst five-eighths\n\nBeauden Barrett (33 / Blues / Taranaki / 123)\n\nDamian McKenzie (29 / Chiefs / Waikato / 47)\n\nMid-fielders\n\nJordie Barrett (27 / Hurricanes / Taranaki / 57) (Vice Captain)\n\nRieko Ioane (27 / Blues / Auckland / 67)\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown (29 / Chiefs / Waikato / 70)\n\nBilly Proctor* (25 / Hurricanes / Wellington / 0)\n\nOutside backs\n\nCaleb Clarke (25 / Blues / Auckland / 20)\n\nEmoni Narawa (24 / Chiefs / Bay of Plenty / 1)\n\nStephen Perofeta (27 / Blues / Taranaki / 3)\n\nSevu Reece (27 / Crusaders / Southland / 23)\n\nMark Tele’a (27 / Blues / North Harbour/ 9)\n\nThe following players were not considered due to injury: Sam Cane, Will Jordan, Samisoni Taukei’aho, Cam Roigard.\n\nScott Barrett, 30, will become the 81st man to captain the All Blacks in a Test should he add to the 69 Test caps he has earned since his debut against Ireland in 2016, and will be assisted by two Vice Captains in Ardie Savea and Jordie Barrett.\n\n“When you think of the leaders who have gone before you, it’s quite humbling to be asked to captain the All Blacks, so it’s not something I took lightly. It’s a big responsibility, but I have two great leaders beside me in Ardie and Jordie, and I know we’ll have the full backing of the coaches,” Barrett said.\n\nRobertson said his long-standing relationship with Scott Barrett was a factor in his choice of captain.\n\n“There are some great leaders in our group, but having that existing connection to Scott was important. He’s tactically astute, he leads from the front, and he’s got the respect of the players and coaches. Leadership is a shared responsibility and Ardie, Jordie and our wider leadership group will be crucial to how we come together and connect ahead of the first Test against England.\n\n“As a coaching group, we are excited about the squad we’ve selected. We know it’s a group that can play the style of rugby we want the All Blacks to play in 2024.”\n\nRobertson also congratulated the five uncapped players in the squad – hooker George Bell, prop Pasilio Tosi, halfback Cortez Ratima, centre Billy Proctor and loose forward Wallace Sititi, who at 21-years-old is the youngest player in the squad.\n\n“It’s a proud moment for them and their families. They’ve earned their places through performance and consistency and it’s an exciting time in their careers. As coaches, we will get them ready so they can take their opportunity when it comes.”\n\nThe All Blacks Steinlager Low Carb Series squad will gather at NZCIS in Wellington for the first time on Wednesday 26 June where they’ll be joined by hundreds of junior rugby players and guests to officially launch the 2024 Test season.\n\nBlues lock Sam Darry, Hurricanes outside back Ruben Love and the Crusaders pair of prop George Bower and midfielder David Havili will also assemble with the squad as cover."
