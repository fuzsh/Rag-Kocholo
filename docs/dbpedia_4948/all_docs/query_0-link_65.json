        "text": "All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson has revealed why outside centre Rieko Ioane has been dropped from the starting line-up for their Rugby Championship Test with Argentina in Wellington on Saturday.\n\nThe experienced centre has been named amongst the replacements for the highly anticipated encounter at the Sky Stadium with Anton Lienert-Brown replacing him in the run-on side.\n\nLienert-Brown started at inside centre in New Zealand‘s previous match against Fiji in San Diego with Billy Proctor lining up outside him in the centres.\n\nThe duo combined well and there was a feeling that Ioane could be replaced by Proctor but Robertson has opted for Lienert-Brown, who is comfortable in both midfield positions.\n\n‘Trust the skill set’\n\nWhen asked for the reasoning behind Ioane‘s demotion and if he had a message for the player, Robertson replied: “Look, those conversations are private. We talk about the individual stuff, but probably the big thing is to trust the skill set.”\n\nRobertson said competition is tight for the outside centre berth but is confident that Lienert-Brown will give a good account of himself.\n\n“We had a conversation with Rieko and it’s a competitive position,” he added. “We’ve got two or three guys we can pick now and it’s a performance-based sport and everyone has got areas to work on and I’ve gone with Anton.”\n\nBlues rookie Sam Darry was another surprise inclusion to start in the second-row and Robertson revealed that he was selected due to an injury to Patrick Tuipulotu, while Josh Lord will offer cover off the replacements bench.\n\nAll Blacks team: Rieko Ioane DROPPED, Scott Robertson’s favourite starts as tight-five stocks bare for Argentina clash\n\n“Yeah, obviously with Patrick, who had a calf injury, so Sam comes in and Josh Lord’s come back from a couple of games, so perfect timing for us,” he said.\n\n“There’s some fresh blood coming through with the second-row, the locks, and Sam’s been impressive since he’s come in, and Josh has worn a black jersey before.\n\n“He’ll get straight up to the mark and standard.”\n\nTuipulotu’s injury means there is a lack of experience in the All Blacks’ second-row as first choice captain Scott Barrett is also ruled out due to a finger injury.\n\nBacking his young locks\n\nBarrett and Tuipulotu were expected to be the All Blacks’ first choice locks after the retirement of Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick after last year’s Rugby World Cup in France but Robertson is backing Darry and Lord to do well against Argentina.\n\n“I think it’s exciting,” he said. “We’ve got a big six foot eight lock coming in and a six foot nine lock on the bench, and they’re good athletes.\n\n“When someone retires, someone gets an opportunity and it’s their opportunity. So we set them up the best we can to perform and they’ve done it themselves as well.\n\n“They’ve earned the role and the opportunity this week.”"
