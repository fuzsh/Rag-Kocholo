Coach: Jake Betts.\n\nPanthers halfback Josh Merritt has not been named to play this weekend as of Friday afternoon but could be a late inclusion. Panthers' differential is currently -12 so they need a strong win to overhaul Bathurst St Pat's (+21) and take fourth place.\n\nCYMS: 1 Jesse Buchan, 2 Ethan Kennedy, 3 Adam Stanford, 21 Marcel Ikinofo, 5 Kiyan Shaw, 6 Liam Wilson, 7 Dan Mortimer, 8 Dylan Kelly, 9 Pat Williams, 10 Jack Buchanan, 11 Ethan Bereyne, 12 Sam Dwyer, 13 Ryan Griffin; Bench: 14 Jack Nobes, 15 Matty Fuller, 16 Angus Thompson, 17 Mitch Collins. Coach: Jack Buchanan.\n\nOrange CYMS will welcome back two key men this weekend with Ryan Griffin and Jack Nobes named to take on the Panthers. Griffin missed last week's game against Dubbo CYMS, while Nobes hasn't featured since a foot injury suffered in round six. A win for Orange CYMS would clinch fourth spot and two chances in the finals.\n\nJack Nobes has been named for play for Orange CYMS for the first time since Sunday, June 2. Picture by Carla Freedman\n\nMacquarie Raiders v Parkes Spacemen\n\nApex Oval, Dubbo\n\nKick-off 2:30pm (league tag starts 11am)\n\nRAIDERS: 1 Charlie Kempston, 2 Ash Widders, 3 Tyson Fuller, 4 Josateki Masibalavu, 5 Carl Ralph, 6 Kyjuan Crawford, 7 Jason Boney, 8 Shaq Gordon, 9 Kane McDermott, 10 Jack Kavanagh, 11 Jack Kempston, 12 Jordan Reynolds, 13 Billy Gilbert; Bench: 14 Aisake Masiwala, 15 Johnny Mafiti, 16 Alex Ronayne, 17 TBC. Coach: Jack Kavanagh.\n\nMacquarie will welcome back captain-coach Jack Kavanagh for their massive home game against Parkes. Kavanagh served a five-week suspension and will start at prop. Charlie Kempston moves to fullback, Ash Widders goes to the wing and Carl Ralph comes back into the side. The Raiders are currently ninth so need to win and hope Wellington is beaten.\n\nPARKES: 1 Sam Dwyer, 2 Malakai Folau, 3 Tuhi Pompey, 4 Fiohira Faingaa, 5 Jacob Smede, 6 Joe Dwyer, 7 Chad Porter, 8 Jake Hutchings, 9 Jake Porter, 10 Nikola Sovatabua, 11 Riley Scott, 12 Brandon Paige, 13 Cody Crisp; Bench: 14 TBC, 15 TBC, 16 TBC, 17 TBC. Coach: Chad Porter.\n\nJoe Dwyer is back at five-eighth in a huge boost for the Spacies after missing last round. Parkes are destined to play Dubbo CYMS in the first week of finals but this weekend's results will decide who finishes second and hosts that fixture.\n\nForbes Magpies v Wellington Cowboys\n\nSpooner Oval, Forbes\n\nKick-off 2pm (league tag starts 10:30am)\n\nFORBES: 1 Tom Toohey, 2 Connor Greenhalgh, 3 Coopa Martin, 4 David White, 5 Jordan Hartwig, 6 Jack Smith, 7 Nick Greenhalgh, 8 Tom Phillips, 9 Tom Hurford, 10 Jake Haddrill, 11 Jack Hartwig, 12 Ben Maguire, 13 Jake Grace; Bench: 14 Joe Morrison, 15 TBC, 16 TBC, 17 TBC. Coach: Cameron Greenhalgh.\n\nStill no sign of Charlie Lennon for Forbes as the Magpies name the same side which defeated Lithgow last weekend. A win for the Magpies could move them into sixth on the ladder and mean they host a finals match.\n\nWELLINGTON: 1 Tyrone Tattersall, 2 Ben Cook, 3 Jeff Lingwoodock, 4 Brock Naden, 5 Brian Baxter, 6 Mason Williams, 7 Rylee Blackhall, 8 Mac Dutfield, 9 Richard Peckham, 10 Manassah Timu, 11 Justin Toomey-White, 12 Jake Newman, 13 Nat Lindsay; Bench: 14 Elijah Colliss, 15 Logan Conn, 16 Jai Merritt, 17 Kenny Everson. Coach: Justin Toomey-White.\n\nIt's mixed news for the Cowboys as playmaker Jai Merritt returns via the bench. Merritt's return from an ankle injury is timely with Wellington being without Seaun Stanley Jr for four weeks after he was suspended. It's simple for the Cowboys, if they win this weekend they'll play finals. Lose, and they'll need things to go their way.\n\nMacquarie's Jack Kavanagh is back for the final round.\n\nMudgee Dragons v Lithgow Workies Wolves\n\nGlen Willow Sporting Complex, Mudgee\n\nKick-off 2pm (league tag starts 10:30am)\n\nMUDGEE: 1 Nathan Orr, 2 Ethan Pegus, 3 David West, 4 Camden Sutton, 5 Josh Wilson-Tuckey, 6 Billy Carberry, 7 Pacey Stockton, 8 Nick Bligh, 9 Kain Munro, 10 Luke Moody, 11 Ryan O'Connor, 12 Cody Godden, 13 Chad Chandler; Bench: 14 Ben Thompson, 15 Hayden Carpenter, 16 James Goonrey, 17 TBC. Coach: Clay Priest.\n\nThe minor premiers won't be risking several key men this weekend when Lithgow come to town. Clay Priest and Jack Beasley both won't play this weekend with Chad Chandler and Kain Munro replacing them. Ben Thompson and Hayden Carpenter make up an experienced bench.\n\nLITHGOW: 1 Tom Large, 2 Riley Dukes, 3 Elias Dukes, 4 Lachie Thompson, 5 Aaron Kelso, 6 Kaidyn Whittaker, 7 Eli Morris, 8 Tom Fraser, 9 Harry Bender, 10 Lachlan Large, 11 Kye Cameron, 12 Travis Dukes, 13 Luke Brown; Bench: 14 Braith Green, 15 Hayden Rodham, 16 Kevin Large, 17 TBC. Coach: Peter Morris.\n\nLithgow haven't made any changes to their starting side but their bench has gone through a minor reshuffle. Braith Green returns to the bench with Jhy Rowley and Ben Fraser dropping out of the side.\n\nNyngan Tigers v Dubbo CYMS\n\nLarkin Oval, Nyngan\n\nKick-off 2pm (league tag starts 10:30am)\n\nNYNGAN: 1 Charlie Wykes, 2 Matty McDougall, 3 James Tuitahi, 4 Terrance Ryan, 5 Connor Elwood, 6 Cooper Black, 7 Will Black, 8 Bill Quarmby, 9 Aidan Bermingham, 10 Vincent Leuluai, 11 Corey Cox, 12 Jackson Cox, 13 Jacob Neill; Bench: 14 Ratu Manoa Satala, 15 Dane Casey, 17 Kelevi Ralulu, 18 Rory Quarmby. Coach: James Tuitahi.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
