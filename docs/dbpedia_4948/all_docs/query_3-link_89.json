        "text": "Scott Robertson has picked lock Scott Barrett as All Blacks captain as the new coach looks to transfer a winning Crusaders combination into the Test arena.\n\nRobertson - a breakdancing, surf loving coach with a personality very different from his predecessors - opted for Barrett ahead of Ardie Savea as skipper despite public polls indicating a preference for the world player of the year.\n\nSavea and Jordie Barrett - Scott's younger brother - were named as vice captains at an event in Christchurch on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch Wallabies vs Wales, All Blacks vs England and Springboks vs Ireland, exclusively ad free, live and on demand on Stan Sport\n\nIt had been previously announced that Sam Cane - who led New Zealand to the final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup - would retire from Test rugby at the end of the season and immediately step down as captain.\n\nCane was not named in a squad of 32 players to prepare for two July Tests against England and one against Fiji.\n\nThe All Blacks said Cane, Will Jordan, Samisoni Taukei'aho and Cam Roigard were not considered due to injury.\n\nREAD MORE: Racing legend in ICU after 'catastrophic' 500km/h crash\n\nREAD MORE: Maroons star bites back at Joey's Latrell claim\n\nREAD MORE: Harsh reality as $800k star weighs Tigers future\n\nBarrett previously served under Robertson as Crusaders captain.\n\n\"There are some great leaders in our group, but having that existing connection to Scott was important,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"He's tactically astute, he leads from the front, and he's got the respect of the players and coaches. Leadership is a shared responsibility and Ardie, Jordie and our wider leadership group will be crucial to how we come together and connect ahead of the first Test against England.\n\n\"As a coaching group, we are excited about the squad we've selected. We know it's a group that can play the style of rugby we want the All Blacks to play in 2024.\"\n\nBarrett, 30, will become the 81st man to captain the All Blacks.\n\nHe has played 69 Tests and debuted against Ireland in 2016.\n\n\"When you think of the leaders who have gone before you, it's quite humbling to be asked to captain the All Blacks, so it's not something I took lightly,\" Barrett said.\n\n\"It's a big responsibility, but I have two great leaders beside me in Ardie and Jordie, and I know we'll have the full backing of the coaches.\"\n\nFormer All Blacks playmaker Lima Sopoaga expressed his surprise that Barrett was preferred to Savea as captain.\n\nSavea had previously filled in as Test skipper when Cane was absent.\n\nIn form players unlucky to miss out included Hoskins Sotutu, Peter Lakai, Ruben Love, Harry Plummer and Brayden Iose.\n\nRobertson named five uncapped players in his squad.\n\nThey were Crusaders hooker George Bell, Hurricanes centre Billy Proctor, Chiefs halfback Cortez Ratima, Chiefs No.8 Wallace Sititi and Hurricanes prop Pasilio Tosi.\n\n\"It's a proud moment for them and their families,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"They've earned their places through performance and consistency and it's an exciting time in their careers. As coaches, we will get them ready so they can take their opportunity when it comes.\"\n\nNEW PODCAST! Michael Atkinson and Sam Worthington chat Wallabies and All Blacks squads plus big Waratahs developments\n\nRobertson said All Blacks forwards coach Jason Ryan had \"fallen in love\" with tighthead Tosi's scrummaging and ball carrying despite only starting six games for the Hurricanes in 2024.\n\n\"He's just an incredible athlete,\" Robertson said of the 25-year-old former loose forward.\n\n\"He took his opportunity when Tyrel (Lomax) was out. He took that opportunity week in and week out. He can start, he can come off the bench and he's a big man and that's what football's about. He's a great kid and he's going to do a great job in the black jersey.\"\n\nHurricanes fullback Love will assemble with the squad as cover along with Blues lock Sam Darry, Crusaders prop George Bower and Crusaders utility David Havili.\n\nRobertson chose only three locks in Barrett, Tupou Vaa'i and Patrick Tuipulotu, who led the Blues to the Super Rugby Pacific title on Saturday while struggling with a knee injury.\n\n\"If he can play with a knee like that and with the other ankle strapped and carry on, he's mentally tough,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"We named him in the squad after a great performance.\"\n\nSititi, 21, edged out Sotutu, Lakai and Iose in a highly competitive selection battle.\n\n\"It was the position that we spent the longest time on,\" Robertson said.\n\n\"My big thing for loose forwards is for them to be great on both sides of the ball, mentally tough and physically tough and that's why we've selected the players we have.\"\n\nMeanwhile, England lock Charlie Ewels was dropped from the tour of New Zealand after receiving a two match ban on Sunday.\n\nEwels was red carded for a dangerous ruck clearout of Japan captain Michael Leitch in their 52-17 Test win on Saturday in Tokyo.\n\nAt his judicial hearing, Ewels didn't believe the foul was red card worthy but the panel disagreed.\n\nHe was suspended from England's next two Tests against the All Blacks on July 6 in Dunedin and July 13 in Auckland.\n\nEwels became the first England international to be sent off twice.\n\nAfter the first instance against Ireland in 2022, he was banned for three games.\n\nEwels was replaced in the tour party by Saracens forward Nick Isiekwe, who was last capped in the 2023 Six Nations.\n\nBarrett also holds the distinction of being the only All Blacks player to be sent off twice in Test matches. - with AP\n\nALL BLACKS SQUAD\n\nHookers: Asafo Aumua, Codie Taylor, George Bell\n\nProps: Ethan de Groot, Tyrel Lomax, Fletcher Newell, Pasilio Tosi, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Tamaiti Williams\n\nLocks: Scott Barrett (c), Tupou Vaa'i, Patrick Tuipulotu\n\nLoose forwards: Ethan Blackadder, Samipeni Finau, Luke Jacobson, Dalton Papali'i, Ardie Savea, Wallace Sititi\n\nHalfbacks: Finlay Christie, TJ Perenara, Cortez Ratima\n\nFive-eighths: Beauden Barrett, Damian McKenzie\n\nMidfielders: Jordie Barrett, Rieko Ioane, Anton Lienert-Brown, Billy Proctor"
