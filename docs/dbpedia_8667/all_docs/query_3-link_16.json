        "text": "XII – Lyon (and surroundings), December 31, 1942: delivery, emotions and broadcasting!\n\nIn the middle of the morning, in the district of the University: “Here is finally the object, Blaise! »\n\n- It was minus one!\n\n– You don't believe so well to say… Can I listen? I didn't dare with my old needle phono, and my wife would have asked me questions!\n\n– You are right, André, these discs are very fragile. Ah, they put it in the pocket of an old Tino Rossi, which they lined with felt to protect it. They even put the labels that go with it! Take the helmet, there...\n\n(…)\n\n– Well, “Catarineta Bella” is Reynaud’s text, you play it first, and “Marinella” is De Gaulle’s. You will remember!\n\n- Of course !\n\n– A word of advice: put it in the middle of a few others while transporting it. That way, if you're controlled...\n\n- You are right. Well, I'm going to take the phonograph to the farm now, by bike, and I'll come back for the records afterwards.\n\n– Be careful… And be on time!\n\n- By the way, how did it happen?\n\n\"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you!\" Ah, these young people, no idea of security! Okay, speaking of security: once Laval's speech is over, don't linger, even if you haven't finished with the speeches of our ministers. Understood ?\n\n………\n\nAs Blaise had just returned to the farm with the discs, he was intercepted by four Economic Control agents. The “Economic Security Guards” were hoping to get their hands on some prohibited (for others) and profitable (for them) goods on this last evening of the year. Discovering nothing better than a piece of dry bread in the panniers of the bike, they were interested in the contents of Blaise's bag: \"Ah, records! We are going to party ? To dance ? »\n\n- But it's not forbidden!\n\n– Dancing, no, except in public! We would dance well, too, you invite us?\n\n– After your work?\n\n- Don't be smart. We set our schedules, and what is prohibited or not!\n\n– Let’s see… I wouldn’t be surprised if this young gandin liked the records of American negroes, banned on pain of a fine!… What! Frehel! Who can still listen to this! Trenet, pff, a zazou for bourgeois! Tino Rossi, without interest! Ah, here's what's better: a Suzy Solidor and a Maurice Chevalier… Confiscated! We have to have fun too, right?\n\nAnd, as Blaise opened his eyes in bewilderment (and actually relief): “Come on, get the hell out of here before we do some skeet shooting with the rest – and happy new year, ha ha! »\n\n………\n\nHe had had a narrow escape and was still sweating, despite the cold, when he arrived at the farm. Six-thirty, it was more than time to install the equipment... Five minutes before seven o'clock, he was ready, headphones on, the disc in place. When the announcer announced Laval's speech, he turned on his record player and flipped the switch, then changed the connection of his headphones, to check what he was sending on the line.\n\nDamn, still moved, he had taken the wrong side: it was not Reynaud's speech, but that of the General: \"While Christmas Day had brought us the fall of Rome, the first enemy capital to fall to power of the allied forces and first of the French and American forces, while the Italians themselves, throwing off the yoke of tyranny, united with the allied armies in the fight against Germany, the last days of the year we offered the liberation of Corsica! Yes, Corsica is free, free from the Germanic yoke, free from the yoke of the Mussolinians, free from the yoke of their henchmen who claim to be French! Corsica, bloodied last year in an admirable struggle, is now the first parcel of national territory occupied by the enemy to have been liberated! (…)\n\nThe turn will come from the other provinces of France, perhaps from this new year. And the turn will come from Paris, Paris of which we think every day! French, your release is near! French, hope, and, when the day comes, act! »\n\nPascal-Blaise only listened to the first few words, plugging his headphones back in to monitor what was coming from the studio. At the end of the speech, he hesitated to return the disk and gave up for fear of a false move – he had just noticed that his fingers were shaking so much that the disk risked slipping out of their hands! Bewildered, he took a deep breath, forced himself to calm down, and put the tonearm back to the start of the Marinella face, replaying the General's speech. But less than a minute later, that of Laval ended and the announcer began to announce the rest of the program. Blaise stopped his installation, unplugged it, then checked one last time that everything was in order. No problem, the music was going well, he could recognize the first bars of an Auvergne bourrée. He put the boards and piles of hay back in place, hiding his equipment before going to knock on the door of the inhabited part of the farm. It was Martine's father who opened the door to her: \"Finally, Pascal! We were just waiting for you! You missed something! I even sent Martine to the cellar to look for a good bottle to celebrate! »\n\n– Oh? What did I miss?\n\n– The speech on Radio-Lyon! You would have heard that! We were told Laval, but we were treated to a fine speech by General De Gaulle, the Minister of War!\n\nLike almost everyone, when he was with reliable people, the farmer referred to “Africans” as the legal government. He wore a big smile: “He confirmed the liberation of Corsica. Ah, it warms my heart to hear that. The Swiss had talked about it a bit, but with the mess in Italy, they weren't sure of anything! And, wait, even better, after the speech, they played “O Corse île d’amour”, by Tino Rossi! All this on Radio-Lyon! I wonder how they did it! »\n\n– And the other stations, what do they say?\n\n– You know very well that we do not catch them with the position we have!\n\nPascal smiled: he knew perfectly well that, if Algiers was jammed almost all the time, London passed the night correctly.\n\nIt was on a small cloud that he started to have dinner, especially since Martine was sitting next to him! But, after the second bite of cardoons, she slipped to him: “A few minutes after the end of the speech, the station stopped broadcasting! He blanched, thinking that his installation was no longer letting the signal through! However, he was sure he had checked everything, and he still had the rhythm of the Auvergne bourrée in his ears. Martine reassured him as best she could and he decided to honor the dinner. It would have been a shame to spoil the chicken and especially the Pommard that came with it, although the latter did not really have time to reach the right temperature. But in war as in war!\n\nXIII – Rhône Prefecture, December 31, 1942: a scandal on the airwaves\n\n7:15 p.m. – The SONEF man was furious: “Mr. Prefect, it’s a scandal! Radio Lyon broadcasts a speech by… the… traitors of Algiers. They dared to say that they had regained control of Corsica. We have to stop this! »\n\n“Don't get upset, Sergeant! Algiers on Radio Lyon, come on, come on! At least you haven't been drinking?...\n\nThe SONEF man turned scarlet, which went rather well with his black uniform, but the prefect preferred to appease him: “Yes, yes, I’m checking. He motioned to one of his secretaries, \"Call the studio and give it to me.\" »\n\n(…)\n\n– So, for you, everything is in order? Is that the President's speech that you played?\n\n- Of course ! And then, folk songs from the French provinces, starting with Corsica, in your honor, Monsieur le Préfet, then Auvergne in honor of the President.\n\n\"Corsica, in my honor?\" It's very nice, but with the latest events, you could have been discreet! Angeli snarled, forgetting that the official NEF radios hadn't yet said anything about the situation in Corsica.\n\n– Really?… Anyway, we got through Monsieur Laval’s speech well. If we didn't give all our speeches, we would have been unemployed or in prison for a long time! We know our job, after all!\n\nThe prefect hung up, displeased. This story of Corsican folk song remained on his stomach. The superintendent approached to slip him: “Monsieur le Préfet, this crazy story is confirmed. One of my men heard the speech... from Algiers. But if it's not the studio, it's the transmitter! »\n\n\"Call the sender and pass it to me!\"\n\n(…)\n\n\"They don't answer, Monsieur le Préfet!\"\n\n– Insist!\n\n(…)\n\n- Always not.\n\n- Alright ! So let's take the cars and see on the spot!\n\nThree Citroën Traction Avant, the prefect's 15 CV leading the way, left the courtyard of the prefecture a few minutes later. They crossed the Rhône, then the Saône, which they ascended for a few minutes before swerving towards the Nationale 7, in the direction of Paris. At the exit of the city, they had to stop: “What is happening? »\n\n– German control, Mr. Prefect.\n\n- Missing more than that !\n\nThe Wehrmacht non-commissioned officer took the papers the driver handed him and, after scrutinizing them for exactly thirty seconds, handed them back, then gave a sharp salute as the soldiers cleared the horses.\n\n- Why did they cut the road?\n\n– Their entire staff is at the Charbonnières casino, which they requisitioned for the New Year, Monsieur le Préfet\n\n– Ah… Good, we are coming.\n\nThe three cars stopped in front of the gate, which was strangely wide open. The door to the building was also open. They entered, everything seemed deserted and abandoned… However, calls were heard, coming from behind a door which was locked. One of the big guys who accompanied the prefect smashed it, not without difficulty – on the other side, they found a dozen technicians and the four guards on duty, all handcuffed, in what was the rest room.\n\n\"Who's the boss here?\"\n\n- It's me, Mr. Prefect\n\n\"Tell me what happened!\"\n\n– We were attacked while we were all together, here, in the canteen, having a drink in honor of the President, while his speech was on! It's tradition, and at the studio, they do the same!\n\n– But you listened to the program?\n\n- But yes of course. The loudspeaker is there, it picks up everything that comes from the studio! We have followed President Laval's entire speech.\n\nAngeli squeaked angrily, \"You're the only ones, apparently!\" »\n\nThe chief technician did not seem to notice the prefect's irritation: \"They arrived, armed to the teeth, at least half a dozen here, and surely others outside, they handcuffed us, and they m asked to follow them. »\n\n- What did they want?\n\n– The chief said to me: You stop your thing or I explode a grenade in the middle! So I obeyed, you think: the equipment had to be preserved, it is the property of the President! I did the simplest thing: I cut off the current properly.\n\n- And after ?\n\n“They sent me back to the rest room, with the others, and handcuffed me to a table leg!\n\n\"Couldn't you do anything?\"\n\n“On the ground, handcuffed, with two guys who were aiming at us with submachine guns?\n\nThe prefect heaved an exasperated sigh. Compassionate, the commissioner took over: “And then? »\n\n- There was a huge noise! Then they left, locking the door. All in all, it didn't last more than ten or twelve minutes.\n\nOne of the prefect's secretaries came into the room and whispered a few words in his ear. This time, Angeli stamped his foot in annoyance: “That noise was the antenna collapsing! They dynamited it! »\n\n– Could you recognize them? asked the commissioner.\n\n– That is to say that they were hooded! Ah, and they were in Army uniform…\n\n- Which army?\n\n– But the nô… I mean, the people of Algiers, of course.\n\nThe prefect sighed again and turned to the superintendent: \"Who do you think he is?\" »\n\n– Terrorists in the pay of the traitors of Algiers, of course!\n\n- And for the speech?\n\n– While one group subdued the technicians who were toasting, other terrorists tinkered with the installation to get their message across. Then they demolished the antenna.\n\n- Yes, it must be that. Do you think we have a chance of finding them?\n\n- They don't have much of a lead. Does the phone still work?\n\n“Yes,” replied one of the technicians.\n\n– Amateurs… Where is the set? They will not escape us!\n\nWhile the commissioner sounded the alarm, the technicians were sent home. Very discreetly, passing in front of a desk, one of them moved a switch… The one that sent the sound from the studio to the loudspeaker in the rest room by the emergency telephone line and not by the main cable.\n\nXIV – Lyon, January 1, 1943… and more\n\nOn this New Year's Day, the people of Lyon, while greeting each other in the street to wish each other a happy new year (or a better year, for the most part, but that's already what they wished for a year earlier) , did not depart from their austere mien. For some, it was out of prudence, because they had heard THE speech, but did not want an enigmatic smile to betray them. For the others, it was out of spite – they hadn't heard it! It was only in private that they could express their satisfaction and, of course, exaggerate the event somewhat, such as by asserting that the transmitter had blown up or, for the most naive, that De Gaulle himself had come. in Lyon speak at the microphone!\n\nPascal-Blaise, for his part, was still not reassured. He returned to the barn, this time accompanied by Martine, and feverishly entered his installation. No matter how hard he plugged in his headphones and tried all the positions of the switch, everything remained silent. Only half reassured, he decided to walk to the transmitter, only three kilometers away. He did not go all the way: he understood when he saw the disappearance of the huge antenna from afar. I didn't know about the whole plan, he thought. The secret, of course! »\n\nHowever, one who did not understand everything, and he was far from the only one, was “Pelletier”. The sabotage of the transmitter was not on the program of Operation Brouilly, but then not at all. Was it an operation of the communist networks, who used to do as they please (the Boss was going to have a lot of work to do on that side, as soon as he returned from Algiers, he thought? he), on the pretext that the fatherland of the Workers had been betrayed and invaded by the co-signatories of their Pact? Or was it an initiative of one of the collabo, pro-Laval or other factions, a kind of provocation?\n\nIn any case, the investigation carried out by the commissioner never worried the staff of the transmitter, at least one member of whom bore a heavy responsibility in the affair of the speeches, if not in that of the blasting of the antenna. Indeed, when Laval's speech had been dispatched from the studio, it had as always followed two paths: that of the cable which Blaise had tackled, but also that of an emergency telephone circuit. This is how the General's speech was broadcast on the air while Laval's was broadcast in the rest room...\n\nAs for the destruction of the antenna, the absence of a claim, the damage that is altogether minor and above all Laval's rather weak reaction today tip the scales towards a scheme on his part, coinciding by chance with the substitution of speeches by the Resistance. Indeed, fifteen days later, when Radio-Lyon had resumed its broadcasts with a temporary antenna, Laval decided to rent to the Occupation its station so threatened by the actions of the Sedition, to broadcast programs intended for the Wehrmacht. , which, following the Italian defection, strengthened its presence in the south-east of France. While the President was receiving a generous rent, the antenna was repaired and raised and the site, now strictly guarded, ceased to be a place for Sunday walks! The antenna was shot down again a few months later, but by the Germans themselves, when they left.\n\nPascal-Blaise finished his year of study and, diploma in hand, returned to Haut-Beaujolais, not under construction sites, but in the maquis, to escape the final requisitions in Germany. He only went to Germany as a soldier in the French Army, which incorporated him into the new Signals arm. Thereafter, he occupied various technical functions of increasing importance in television – he nevertheless returned to visit his father-in-law's farm regularly, in particular to celebrate New Year's Eve with his family.\n\nPrefect Angeli was retired by Laval in the spring of 1943, which did not prevent him from being heavily condemned at the Liberation, barely escaping the firing squad.\n\nAs for the Radio-Lyon transmitter, although unused for more than half a century, it still stands not far from the National 7, a few kilometers before Lyon coming from Paris. Pascal's father-in-law's farm, on the other hand, is now unrecognizable, with almost all the buildings, including the barn, having been demolished and rebuilt.\n\nThe “little war” in German doctrine\n\nAccording to a very commonplace, the rigid German army has always favored the doctrine of direct confrontation resulting from a (questionable) reading of Clausewitz: concentration of forces and tactical superiority allowing the destruction of the main body of the adversary have indeed long represented the alpha and omega of strategic thinking in Berlin. How, under these conditions, could the use of units whose impact is by nature indirect be integrated into the 1939 battle plan?\n\nQuite simply because it is the fruit of a long tradition of struggle against the various separatist or insurrectionary movements which plagued the Austro-Hungarian Empire throughout the 19th century. Faced with bands of irregulars who have long since mourned any ambition to defeat the K.u.k Armee on the battlefield, but nevertheless are determined to carry on a guerrilla war in spite of machine guns, repeating rifles and transport trains of troops, the imperial officers quickly became aware of the extreme vulnerability of the logistics of modern armies. To face this threat, they thus formed Banden, small forces of light infantry intended to protect their provisions and to carry the iron at the adversary, on its own ground.\n\nOne of the first was the Streifkorps, a border guard unit stationed between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, created by the Habsburg Empire in 1883. It was mainly made up of local volunteers, poachers and soldiers targeted by measures disciplinary, all supervised by officers who are keen hunters. The Strafunis (or “grey hawks”) had to operate with great efficiency against Chetnik infiltration, smugglers and other häidouks regularly crossing the border…\n\nOn the German side, it was not there: the fight against the snipers in Alsace-Moselle had been improvised by units of reservists, who multiplied the reprisals, according to the instructions of Chancellor Bismarck, and with the... firmness that the we know. Subsequently, around 1890, the Second Reich, following the Austrian example, formed many Jagdkommandos of light infantry, but for very different reasons. It was then for the Deutsches Heer to monitor the huge border with the Russian Empire, using very mobile units. The Hohenzollern army, with its iron discipline, framed by a nobility jealous of its privileges and prompt to the most brutal punishments at the slightest prank, always affected to despise the action of the \"francs-tireurs\" - those of the enemy had to be systematically shot in the event of capture *...\n\nIt will therefore be necessary to wait for the Boxer War for a young Bavarian Leutnant, Franz Ritter von Epp (future dignitary of the Nazi Party…), to deploy Jadgkommandos in combat for the first time. It was then above all a question of operations of repression, carried out moreover with more brutality than efficiency, but which nevertheless allowed the birth of the concept of Bandenbekämftung (literally hunt for bandits), later formalized in a chapter of the manual of the German infantry under the title Operations against the Chinese bandits.\n\nThese German-speaking light forces were then seen above all as an instrument of repression and defense much more than of attack. The observation of the Boer War in South Africa – during which the Afrikaner Kommandos put Her Britannic Majesty's powerful forces through hell – also provided food for thought in Vienna as in Berlin… but without any lessons in be fired! Under the weight of conservatism requiring constant visual control of formations, ambushes and sabotage were once again postponed, as they were deemed unworthy and above all not necessary for the conflict in preparation. Still the weight of Clausewitz and Hannibal… This, moreover, despite the bloody application of the Bandenbekämftung in Deutsch-Südwestafrika (current Namibia, then a German colony) by Generalleutnant von Trotha, in the face of the revolt of the Hereros and Namas **! And all the while the Japanese were attacking Port Arthur by the methods of their Prussian advisers, that is, bayonets in close ranks, and suffering properly appalling casualties in utter indifference.\n\nSo, apart from the fight against infiltration and counter-guerrilla tactics, it will take the stalemate of trench warfare – apart from the real guerrilla warfare led by von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa – for the Central Powers deign to consider the use of light infantry for offensive purposes. Once again, and initially, this will be essentially the work of the Austro-Hungarians who, confronted with the Russian “small hunting teams” (Akotnitchyi Komandyi), systematically set up Jadgkommandos copying the methods of the enemy , one section per regiment. As for the German army, during the 1914 offensive it had indeed resorted to a few fast automobile groups, sometimes in enemy uniform, to infiltrate the Allied lines (one of them blew up the bridge of the Canaples railway, north of Amiens ***) … However, it relied above all on its Sturm-Pioniere, equipped in particular with flamethrowers, to strike the enemy in the heart. Even if they did put the French to rout at the start of the battle of Verdun, we cannot speak here of light infantry and harassment... The whole - Jadgkommandos like Sturm-Pioniere - was then absorbed by the famous Sturmtruppen.\n\nThe latter, resulting from a Prussian reflection based on the successes of the Sturm-Abteilung Rohr in the Vosges then (also) in Verdun, were perhaps the closest to the concept of offensive special forces as we understand it in today: small shock troops, selected, mobile, knowing the terrain perfectly, very well trained and capable of achieving a strategic objective by their own means. That of the Sturmtruppen was above all to seize the first trenches to allow the breakthrough, thus replacing the tanks which the Second Reich never had. Even if the concept soon showed its limits, its imprint – thanks to triumphs such as during the Matz offensive – marked a whole generation of promising officers, even if the Sturmtruppen operated much more here as shock infantry than as light infantry.\n\nExample of Sturm-Pioniere equipement\n\nAs soon as the Treaty of Versailles was signed and Germany (theoretically) disarmed, the Reichswehr quite naturally integrated a concept of inexpensive, motivated and easily concealed units into its plan for \"continuation\" of the interwar period, then in its new doctrine of mechanized breakthrough followed by enemy annihilation. And this with all the more ease since such units already often constituted the heart of the Freikorps defending Germany against the Soviets and other Poles in Silesia ****! The new Spezial Einheiten would have the task of seizing the infrastructures necessary for the progress of the Panzerdivisions, of disorganizing the adversary and thwarting his rise in line, of disrupting his communications and more generally of spreading panic on his rear. The famous \"Fifth Column\" which still haunts the minds of many witnesses of the terrible spring of 1940 was in the making... But let's first examine the circumstances of their creation.\n\n* There is no need to recall here the sack of Louvain in 1914 – and this tradition, alas, would not be lost with the fall of the Empire.\n\n** This tactic eventually replaced the initial attempts at encirclement battles. More than 85,000 Africans were to die during this campaign...\n\n*** Let us cite here, for the record, the action of Oberleutnant Maximilian von Cossel, who carried out on the night of October 2 to 3, 1916 the first airborne raid in history by being dropped off by a Roland C.II 85 kilometers behind Russian lines to blow up a railway line. There was absolutely nothing strategically organized about such individual actions, however.\n\n**** The Freikorps will end up, according to the wishes of Marshal Hindenburg, by forming a separate unit, the Grenzschutz Ost (Guardians of the East). Theoretically dedicated to defence, some will nevertheless go to defend Greater Germany as far as Latvia...\n\nA hesitant birth\n\nThe existence of the regiment z.b.V. 800 Brandenburger is inseparable from that of another organization: the Abwehr, the intelligence service of the German Navy for the Wehrmacht. The latter, during the 1920s, vegetated under the influence of the Treaty of Versailles, like the majority of the German army – and as much, moreover, because of the sanctions imposed as the lack of interest that the Reichswehr took in intelligence. and small war. The creation of the Wehrmacht in 1935, after Admiral Canaris was appointed head of the Abwehr on January 1 of that year, led to the renewal of the service. Canaris hastened from that moment to reactivate the Eastern Freikorps in anticipation of the inevitable conflict with Poland *.\n\nThe growth of the Abwehr is spectacular: in two years, the numbers in Berlin have increased from 150 people to more than a thousand! Question of ambition, in the perspective of the world conflict which is announced. Question of survival, too, in the face of Reinhardt Heydrich's Sicherheitsdienst, who aspires to seize all the intelligence of the Reich in the name of the SS...\n\nHowever, to allow its organization to develop, Canaris must recruit. And the most political profiles are already largely monopolized by the Black Order, he is forced to look elsewhere. For example in the ranks of the Grenzschutz Ost, and more specifically of the Spezialpolizei des Oberschlesischen Selbstschutz – the Special Self-Defense Police of Upper Silesia. An organization absolutely not state, but nevertheless linked to the Freikorps, and which had brought together up to 200 men in civilian clothes responsible for committing attacks or assassinations in the territories occupied by the Polish militias **. His insignia (a sword ripping open a knot of vipers) would later be taken up by some Brandenburgers as part of their anti-partisan actions. Its two main conductors, Heinz Hauenstein and Gerhardt Roßbach, had not however made a career. The first, after having been one of the main members of the Heinz organization (responsible for resisting the occupation of the Ruhr by sabotage), had been expelled from the NSDAP following apparatus struggles. The second had meanwhile been a political victim of the Night of the Long Knives. On the other hand, middle managers of the Spezialpolizei, such as Oberleutnants Hubertus von Aulock and Friedrich-Wilheim Heiz, all former members of the SA, remained available.\n\nSpezialpolizei des Oberschlesischen Selbstschutz Insigna\n\nThus, from its birth, the future Brandenburger Regiment was particularly political and closely linked to the Nazi regime, regardless of the sometimes more measured opinions of some of its members. These professionals of irregular warfare, for the most part multilingual, were most often recruited after eight years of membership in the NSDAP! They soon joined the Abteilung II of the Abwehr, in charge of sabotage.\n\nBut a set of talents does not make a military force – it was still necessary to find a charismatic and undisputed personality capable of uniting this disparate group to make it the armed fist of the Abwehr. Surprisingly, like a return to origins, the solution came from Africa… Among the soldiers who had participated in von Lettow-Vorbeck's campaign in East Africa against forces ten times superior, one name stood out: the Feldwebel Theodor von Hippel. The latter, returned to Berlin in 1919 with a certain number of sons of settlers from the former Deutsch-OstAfrika – men quickly won over by the most revengeful theses – was transferred from the Engineering to the Abwehr on November 1, 1937. He hastened to propose setting up small units specializing in infiltration and sabotage… A suggestion immediately rejected – as usual – by the central staff, but which nonetheless caught Canaris' attention. The latter therefore gave her some control over the Abteilung II, and charged her with forming the Freikorps made up of Sudeten Germans who were to sow trouble in Czechoslovakia during the Munich crisis in 1938. Subsequently, this unit also implanted Volksdeutsche all along the Polish border during the summer of 1939, in order to prevent any destruction in Upper Silesia and facilitate the progression of the Wehrmacht…\n\nThe Founding Father: Theodor Von Hippel\n\n*The Abwehr will go so far as to infiltrate Polish industrial sites with agents intended to prevent any act of sabotage during the invasion.\n\n** These veterans of the Marine-brigade and the freikorps Roßbach had gone so far as to hold up a prison guarded by French soldiers to free 21 prisoners held by the allied commission of Cosel !\n\nFirst weapons in Poland\n\nDuring the invasion of Poland in September 1939, for lack of formed units, the Abwehr had to rely on these Volksdeutsche, but also on smugglers and other Germanophile local minorities (the Kashubians, the Sorbs and only a few Ukrainians) to weigh in the battle. These disparate elements are brought together by the now Hauptmann von Hippel within the Ebbinghaus battalion, which will put several detachments at the disposal of the Wehrmacht during its advance.\n\nThese elements will experience mixed fortunes…\n\nThus, crossing the Slovak border a few hours before the start of hostilities, the Sudetenlanders of the Leutnant der reserve Hans-Albrecht Herzner group attacked the Mosty station and (especially) its strategic double tunnel passing under the Beskid mountains – which separate the former Czechoslovakia of Poland. Crossing the forest on foot, these 70 men seized their objective during a sudden assault, and defused the charges set up by the Poles in the tunnel *. A brilliant success, then… except that we are on August 31, 1939, and Hitler has just postponed Fall Weiss to September 1. Alerted by a courageous switchboard operator, Warsaw sends reinforcements which force Herzner to flee. The tunnel will be blown up on September 1, 1 hour 15 minutes after the start of the fighting **.\n\nHans-Albrecht Herzner - the man who took a tunnel before the war\n\nThe same in the middle of his group, before the operation\n\nAnother action, much further north and which this time will start on time: the capture of the Graudenz road bridge, spanning the Vistula, in the Danzig corridor. The men of Oberleutnant Tanzer, in Polish uniforms ***, try to seize it... much too slowly, because they are overtaken by the regular German infantry who have left in the meantime and are made prisoners of war! By the time the misunderstanding had cleared up, the bridge had blown up... A little further down the river, at Tczew, Major Medem's KampfTrupp was no luckier. Ambushed in a freight car, he had to seize the railway bridge over the Vistula as soon as his firing post was destroyed by the Luftwaffe. But his train leaves late and is directed to a siding where a good part of the Polish garrison is waiting for him, while the Heinkel 111s miss their target! The work will jump, of course...\n\nFinally, in Danzig itself, the detachment in charge of seizing the Polish post failed in its assault and had to call on the SS to reduce the resistance of the fifty or so Poles who had entrenched themselves there. The surviving defenders, captured, will be shot…\n\nFinally, only the group of the Leutnant der reserve Siegfried Grabert showed real efficiency. Disguised as railway workers, his 80 men seized by force and despite significant resistance the vital railway junction of Katowice. Let's remember the name of Grabert - he will still be talked about...\n\nSiegfried Grabert - one of the best soldiers in the unit. Died on the Eastern Front in 1942 OTL (in the Caucasus)\n\nThe rest of the campaign is spent in in-depth reconnaissance and specific interventions, whether successful or not. Thus, in Demblin, a group of Volkdeutsches who had served in the Polish army took the bridge over the Vistula by taking advantage of a Stuka raid, and without firing the slightest shot! The demolition charges are defused as the first panzers loom on the horizon… But further afield, in Warsaw, when Major Schmalschläger's group tries to seize the Polish army's intelligence service headquarters, Piłsudski square, he had to fall back almost immediately against the stubborn resistance of the defenders of the capital.\n\nBeginnings… so sluggish, moreover marred by numerous rumors of war crimes ****, which contrast singularly with the 'apparent' success of Operation Gleiwitz (the fake attack on the radio station by the Polish army), organized by the SD to trigger the conflict... The Nazi hierarchy, however, decides to retain the positive (after all, the majority of failures are linked to a deplorable lack of coordination!) and sends the whole unit back to Brandenburg-sur-Havel, for a creation that was going to make history...\n\nThis was the culmination of a process that was circumspect to say the least: from September 15, 1939, and despite multiple rebuffs from the staff and other vexations on the ground, the first Deutsche Kompanie z.b.V. was created, in absolute secrecy and on the orders of Hauptmann Putz (Head of the Abwehr II office in Vienna). The latter then brought together only 80 veterans of the Sudetendeustches Freikorps and 150 volunteers from various backgrounds. Sign of the discretion in which the case was set up, the unit (commanded by the Hauptmann der reserve Verbeek then by the Oberleutnant der Reserve Kniesche) then went to the town of Sliač, in Slovakia, to train for the capture of works of art in the uniform of Monsignor Tiso's army, embellished with a simple Deutsche Kompanie armband. But a few days later, in Berlin, Admiral Canaris - finally assured of his back and the support of his hierarchy - ordered von Hippel to raise a specific unit devoted to special operations. And, on October 25, 1939, the Bau-Lehr-Kompanie z.b.Z.800 was finally founded.\n\nThe Brandenburgers – so named because their GeneralfeldzeugMeister-Kaserne was located in Brandenburg an der Havel – were born.\n\nWe note here, weight of the history of the First World War and concern for confidentiality oblige, that the Brandenburg Regiment administratively falls under the Engineers. Indeed, Bau-Lehr explicitly refers to the pioneers. However, z.b.Z. stands for Zur Besonderen Vewendung – “for special use”, a term sometimes used for marching units. And in fact, the regiment will have very diverse formations, including several mountain companies.\n\n*This point remains highly disputed by local military historians, some of whom still claim today that the Warsaw army never lost control of the work.\n\n** Convinced that it was appropriate to pay tribute to the bravery of his men, Canaris will propose Hans-Albrecht Herzner for the Iron Cross 2nd class. The latter will be refused by Generaloberst Keitel on the pretext that at the time of the action, the Reich was not at war! Herzner will finally be decorated on October 29 – this vexation is only further proof of the contempt of the hierarchy for commando actions.\n\n*** German light infantry have always tended to use unregulated tricks of war (soldiers pretending to surrender to better open fire, French uniforms dressed to approach English troops, “Cease fire” bells played just before a assault). Simply tolerated during the First World War, these practices were then legitimized under the pretext of Revenge – and ended up being almost integrated into the Rules.\n\n**** Warsaw notably accused the Ebbinghaus battalion of the massacre of 17 defenders (including scouts!) in Pszczcyna, as well as the torture and then the murder of 29 civilians in Orzesze.\n\nExpansion and training\n\nFor an initially discreet unit with reduced numbers, the Brandenburg regiment quickly grew in size. Around the Ebbinghaus battalion – which could now claim experience in fire – came to agglomerate a crowd of volunteers from all arms and attracted by the rumor of the formation of an elite unit. This impressive flow nevertheless quickly dried up in the face of the dangerousness of the planned missions. It was therefore necessary to relaunch recruitment on a regular basis through visits to the Heer regiments and to the staffs – most often to the great displeasure of the local officials, who had no desire to see their best elements leave… To these recruits s added a certain number of Volksdeutsches from abroad, called by the NSDAP/AO* and who presented themselves on the territory of the Reich to avoid being mobilized in their country of residence – which would undoubtedly be an adversary tomorrow. Coming from the Balkans, the Baltic and the Americas, these profiles, both motivated and diverse – but necessarily suitable for infiltration – were to be recruits of choice for the Brandenburg.\n\nBut of course, being a polyglot was not enough to be recruited. The selection was drastic: a certain physical condition, but also an ability to blend into the environment and… a great ability to obey the finger and the eye were required for the admission of recruits. It was a question of training elite soldiers, as reliable as they were ingenious.\n\nAfter this first skimming, followed a series of absolutely all eliminatory tests: calculation of IQ, psychological resistance, extremely harsh physical tests, testing of anger control, study of the ability to improvise... All of these ordeals, all of them very restrictive, but without cultural a priori, naturally led to a great social mix: from former Sturmpioniere to ex-Gebirgsjägers, passing through the sons of African settlers, former members Freikorps, university sportsmen, German-speaking Belgians** or even veterans of the French Légion étrangère (!), everyone had to rub shoulders!\n\nThe majority of these men, however, had not known the front or the fire – they therefore needed experienced leadership, which was taken from the reserve units of the Wehrmacht. We thus found in Brandenburg a large number of members of the “Turkish mission” deployed in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, who proudly wore the Gallipoli star on their jacket! Finally dressed in their new black uniform – but that of the pioneers, not that of the SS*** – the 320 recruits joined the 250 veterans already in training at Sliač or deployed in Romania.\n\nDelighted with such a copious contingent (much more than expected), the Abwehr decided to divide these 570 men into two companies, under the unified command of von Hippel:\n\n– the 1. Kompanie (the former Kompanie z.b.V. of Slovakia, which would eventually be encased in Neustift-Innermanzing) – Oberleutnant Der Reserve Kniesche;\n\n– the 2. Kompanie (the new Bau-Lehr-Kompanie z.b.Z. 800) – Hauptmann Fabian, then Oberleutnant Wolf-Justin Hartmann ****.\n\nWolf-Justin Hartmann\n\n– A 3. Kompanie created later in Bad Münstereifel – Hauptmann Hans-Joachim Rudolf, former pioneer from Latin America and fluent in Spanish.\n\nTo take account of this new workforce, the Bau-Lehr-Kompanie z.b.Z. 800 became the Bau-Lehr-Bataillon “Brandenburg” on December 15, 1939 – thus marking a further expansion … which was not the last! The new battalion was further reinforced in February 1940 by a 4. Kompanie formed from two groups recruited by Siegfried Grabert and Hans-Albrecht Herzner. She was entrusted to Oberleutnant Wilhelm Walter – a defector from the 5. ID bearing on his cheek the mark of a few manly fencing tournaments. Each of the four companies was then divided into half-companies (1. and 2. Halßkompanien) for more operational flexibility. Gathering men representing 15 nationalities and speaking more than 20 languages, the battalion gradually took on more than substantial importance in the projects of the Abwehr.\n\nWilheim Walther and his scar\n\nCombat training was finally carried out discreetly at the specialized (and autonomous) Combat School at Gut Quenzsee. On the shores of the lake, just 3 kilometers from their HQ, the Brandenburgers first underwent extreme pioneer training – shooting, pipe bombing, sabotage, mine clearance, reconnaissance, hand-to-hand combat, sentry neutralization, infiltration , mob psychology, first aid, designing false papers, driving foreign vehicles and even learning about the everyday environment of the enemy soldier were all subjects at the Oberleutnant Kustsche school. In addition, volunteers could take courses in sailing*****, swimming, switch neutralization and parachuting (at the Fallschirmjäger school in Oranienburg).\n\nGebirgsjaegers in training:\n\nThe whole therefore fully corresponded to the modus operandi of the unit, which von Hippel had directly developed with Canaris. Beyond this, a particular constant dominated: infiltration under double uniform or Halßtarnung (half-camouflage)******. However, the permanent wearing of enemy uniforms (Volltarnung, complete camouflage) would sometimes be practiced, notably on the Russian front or for the anti-partisan struggle in the Balkans – but in these operations, little quarter was expected in the event of capture. Constant reminder of the commitment as well as the risks incurred – these missions will never be imposed, but always based on volunteering.\n\nDuring the winter of 1940, the battalion gradually acquired a very special esprit de corps – all the more easily as the skills of a simple soldier could supplant that of his superior in many areas. The hierarchy, although present, became relaxed… We no longer saluted, we shook hands – within the confines of the barracks at least*******.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, as the Reich prepared to sweep across Western Europe, unity was ready. A sign of its recognized importance: it can only be activated by the OKH, after validation by the OKW, its effective deployment being the responsibility of at least one army. Its regulations specify that it is a “unit formed for [a particular type] of action and difficult to replace (…). [His commitment] must be motivated and [must] be reserved for specific tasks or desperate cases. When the front becomes stationary, the unit is to be removed from the front. »\n\nProud of his new tool, Theodor von Hippel brags during an inspection: “With these men, we will seek the Devil all the way to hell! He didn't know how right he was.\n\nHeinz and the recruits in training at the Gut Quenzsee ground in 1941:\n\n*The organization centralizing the Nazi parties abroad.\n\n** Originally from the three cantons of Eupen, Malmedy and Saint-Vith, these elements were considered very unreliable by the Belgian command, which had grouped almost all of them into the Troupes auxiliaires de l'Armée (Auxiliary Troops of the Army). The acronym TAA, which could be interpreted as \"Tiere Aller Art\" - \"Various Animals\", was seen as a real leper's bell by those who wore it.\n\n*** It will later be replaced by a better known light green, accompanied by an armband bearing the name of the unit. But in reality, a large number of recruits wore their original uniform for routine activities.\n\n**** Hartmann presented a most atypical profile – therefore representative of the Brandenburgers. Born in South America, he had been a combatant in the Asien-Korps, a prisoner of war in Egypt, a member of the Freikorps and a novelist!\n\n***** Essentially, it was about training ship crews to allow for the insertion of troops – the Geistersegler (ghost sailors).\n\n****** Precaution to escape the fate of the spies – the Brandenburger was supposed to infiltrate in enemy uniform and then, once in place, fight under German colors. Obviously, to do this, and although undressing classes were planned (!), coats were preferred to leotards.\n\n******* This practice was no doubt encouraged in order to make the Brandenburgers lose the military stiffness which was to betray many German agents on mission.\n\nDiscreet triumphs in Scandinavia and Benelux\n\nIn April 1940, prior to his Westfeldzug, and fearing an Allied intervention in Sweden by Norway – a truly disastrous eventuality for its metal supply – Hitler urgently ordered the launch of Operation Weserübung: the invasion of Denmark and Norway. The Brandenburg battalion takes part in it by improvising a Nordzug composed mainly of experienced skiers and Polish or English speaking personnel. This Nordzug is divided into several sections to achieve as many objectives.\n\n- In Denmark, the section of Feldwebel Sorgenfrey must cut communications between Gedser and Nykøbing Falster, seize Tinglev station and finally seize the railway bridge near Padborg. Infiltrated as civilians, these men will accomplish their mission without difficulty – with all the more ease since the Danish resistance will be very brief. All the more brief as the section of the Leutnant Lotzel, deployed in gliders, landed without incident and seized the bridges over the Great Belt strait, thus notably facilitating the progress of the Heer towards Copenhagen.\n\n- In Norway, the 42 men of Major Kewisch first reach Oslo by train (and in civilian clothes of course). The command ordered him to neutralize the radio and telephone communications, which he accomplished without difficulty,\n\nThen later, when the situation evolved favorably for the Wehrmacht – at least in the south of the country – the whole group was redeployed towards Trondheim and a section was even sent to Narvik, where it fought until the Allied troops re-embarked and the Norwegian surrender on June 10, 1940.\n\n………\n\nMeanwhile, on the Dutch-Belgian border, the other Brandenburgers are preparing to strike in the West in isolated cantonments and forcefully subjected to military secrecy. Two units were assigned to the invasion of Benelux: the 4. Kompanie with the 6. and 18. Armee, facing the Netherlands, and the 3. Kompanie with the 4. Armee, facing Belgium. Their task is fully consistent with their training as well as with their doctrine: to seize crossing points on the Meuse, the Meuse canal and the Albert canal. The capture of the Maastricht bridges is the responsibility of another specific unit of the Abwehr, the Infantry-Batallion z.b.V. 100 (Hauptmann Fleck), not related to the Brandenburgers. To assist them, the Germans can count on local auxiliaries: trusted Nazi sympathizers who will serve as guides and facilitators in the event of an encounter with a patrol...\n\n…\n\nIn the Netherlands, the sections of the 4. Kompanie experienced varying fortunes, but most often favorable: if that in charge of capturing the Arnhem bridge failed (captured section, Unteroffizier Wurst killed while trying to flee), that in charge of the bridges of Nijmegen seizes without striking a blow the works of art of Malgen and Hatert – the demolition charges are deposited and the garrisons neutralized.\n\nA little further south, the 3rd section (Leutnant Witzel) advances on the Heumen bridge, disguised as prisoners escorted by gendarmes. As soon as the dam opens, the foxes throw themselves into the henhouse! But the casemates defending the work resist fiercely and it will take a fierce fight to seize the objective. Even further south, the 1st section of Oberleutnant Walther took advantage of the two local NSNAP collaborators who accompanied them to also play strong and convincing deserters… The Dutch guarding the east bank of the Gennep bridge let them approach – and the surprise of seeing the 'captives' and their escort pointing arms at them as soon as they were within range. However, for lack of manpower – the Brandenburgers are only 9! – they cannot honestly repeat the operation on the west bank, where 30 Batavian soldiers are wondering what is going on. Playing boldly, Walther advances with only two men, as if to discuss ... before throwing grenades at the Dutch, reservists who disperse in nature. By the time they rally and return to the charge, the 256. ID has arrived… For this extraordinary feat, Walther will become the first Brandenburger to receive the Iron Cross (June 24).\n\nView of the Gennep bridge (Holland) after the assault - Batavian uniforms are still appropriate:\n\nHowever, not everything can work equally well. The 2nd section (Leutnant Siegfried Grabert) must take the four bridges between Buggenum and Maaseik. Disguises - it's a mania! – as railway workers, the men of Unteroffizier Hilmer seize the Buggenum bridge by surprise, but let two soldiers slip away who manage to warn the sappers. The bridge collapses into the Meuse, taking with it three of the Brandenburgers (who also have three wounded). For its part, the Feldwebel Weber group is surrounded by a patrol of reservists and forced to reveal itself – when the German uniforms appear, the Batavian sentries run away screaming! However, they give the alert early enough for the Roermonde bridge to be blown up, before the last two bridges are also destroyed in the process.\n\nFinally, north of Maastricht, the men of Leutnant Kürschner seized three of the four bridges over the Juliana Canal without a shot – the defenders of the last, located at Born, welcomed the Germans with machine guns and 47-mm cannons. mm. It will be necessary to wait for the artillery of the 7. ID to force the Dutch to surrender – but the defenders having no explosives, the work remains intact. The Germans have only 14 wounded and take 175 prisoners. Later, a detachment of Belgian motorcyclists trying to go up towards Holland in turn fell on the Germans – surprised, the latter had to fall back, abandoning their wounded.\n\nFor its part, in Maastricht, the Infanterie-Batallion z.b.V. 100 completely fails to infiltrate – all targeted bridges elude him and are destroyed. The action of the 4. Kompanie of Brandenburg was therefore decisive for the success of the invasion of Holland.\n\n…\n\nIn Belgium, Rudloff's 3. Kompanie was no less effective – in any case, it was not content to observe from afar the paratroopers of the Sturm-Abteilung Koch storming the fortress of Eben-Emael. Disguised as civilians or Belgian soldiers, his men carried out a series of individually insignificant but decisive actions for the benefit of Rommel's 7. Panzer: cut in communications, seizure of the Saint-Vith station, capture of three bridges on the Our which will allow the tanks of the future Balkan Fox to head south. Out of 24 designated targets, 19 will fall – but not smoothly. At Saint-Vith station, the Brandenburgers came up against elements of another elite formation: the Chasseurs Ardennais, embarking westward. The fight drags on and begins to go awry for the Germans…until the train driver panics and starts the convoy off, giving them the battlefield! Leaving the station, the train finds itself under fire from another section which has just seized the railway bridge – it stops it and forces it to surrender. In the meantime, one of the bridges of Saint-Vith is destroyed by the Belgian sappers, alerted by the noise of the fight... The day finally ends with the attack on the local police station, where the Feldwebel Kretschmar - a Sudeten - slips behind the Belgian police to force them to lay down their arms. For only three wounded, the 3. Kompanie captured several dozen enemy soldiers and seized all the crossing points (except the Saint-Vith bridge and two bridges further south, destroyed during the approach). She will collect 8 1st class Iron Crosses and 84 2nd class – a great performance for a single day of combat.\n\nFinally, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the sections of Oberleutnants Schöller and Eggers – in civilian clothes – easily seized the bridges over the Sûre and the Our. Guderian will not be stopped here.\n\nA few days later, when the group was recalled to Germany, the 2. Halbkompanie of the 4. Kompanie (Leutnant Grabert) was tasked with preventing the destruction of the Nieuport locks by the British. This will be Operation Martin. On the evening of May 27, about twenty soldiers dressed in English uniforms tried to get into a captured bus. The ruse does not work: the vehicle is strafed and the group must take shelter. The situation remains frozen until nightfall. Taking advantage of the very professional regularity of the British (who only fired their flares one by one, letting them burn to the end), Grabert, his deputy Janowski and four other Brandenburgers crawled to the enemy positions to cut the wires of the explosives… This done, they appear out of nowhere, dropping grenades and bursts on stunned defenders while the rest of the group charges. The Tommies are put to flight and the work stormed – another complete success, therefore, for the regiment.\n\nGrabert poses proudly after his raid on the locks of Nieuport:\n\nIt is surprising that these multiple feats of arms have not been the subject of more publicity. It is that, unlike the SS – who benefit from the political support of their weapon – and the Fallschirmjägers – whose praises Goebbels sings day and night – the Brandenburg has no benefactor to give it a spotlight… that he doesn't want. It is not in the nature of intelligence services to seek publicity…\n\nIts story could undoubtedly have ended there in Western Europe if the French Republic had not chosen to continue the fight. While he aspired to rest if not to glory, the Brandenburg was therefore called to France during the operational break at the end of June - beginning of July, necessary for the re-establishment of German logistics and which would allow (alas) the conclusion of the first French campaign.\n\nAlpes et Provence – Mountains, river and fortifications\n\nHartmann's 1. Kompanie is the first to enter. In fact, and despite the ordered break, the fighting is struggling to really stop around Lyon... And for lack of works to seize as in Holland - almost all the bridges over the Rhône have been destroyed - the Brandenburgers are quickly solicited by the 16. Armee (in the Alps) to try to force the locks put in place by the French. Indeed, at the gates of Grenoble, the Heer accumulated losses in the Voreppe gully against the guns firing from the summits... Wolf-Justin Hartmann therefore dispatched half a company - mainly former mountain troops, of course - while he is preparing the sequel on the banks of the Rhône. On July 3, he will witness the defeat of the troops trying to seize Tain-L'Hermitage, which convinces him that it is only possible to cross the rivers at an acceptable cost by trickery.\n\nOn July 10, the Brandenburgers take action. In the valley of Grenoble, leaving to the Gebirgsjägers the task of attacking the Chartreuse, 40 men infiltrated towards the Vercors plateau by crossing the Isère around Vinay, disguised as refugees from the region… The line of front crossed – it is very sparsely furnished in this not very strategic sector, the French have left a minimum of troops behind – they climb towards Malleval-en-Vercors then walk through the woods towards their objective.\n\nAt the same time, near Châteauneuf-sur-Isère, a dozen men chosen by Hartmann from among Germans speaking English – even African dialects *– and dressed in French uniforms tried to infiltrate at night through three different crossing points. Their goal is to secure an embryonic bridgehead which will allow the landing of the rest of the group, which will clear a space facilitating the future assault... Indeed, given the vigilance of the French - who are of course expecting an attempt to passage in force on the bridges of Romans – the Oberleutnant has given up on seizing the works of art. Might as well send his men to the massacre. On the other hand, very long and very meticulous reconnaissance - carried out under enemy fire, while hoping that the flow of the Isère would eventually drop... - made it possible to identify several weak points in the defenses, faults that the Brandenburgers are keen to enlarge. And yet, the attempt of July 10 is not really successful: the first group is spotted as soon as the canoe is in the water – under fire, it has to withdraw towards the friendly bank. The second group – that of the “Africans” – does not manage to cross, as the current is strong. He must give up. As for the third group, it drifts, carried along towards the current, to a deserted area west of its objective. At least he was able to cross! Learned from this experience and even though the “regular” assault is already on the way to failure**, Hartmann prefers to call back these lost children – no need to take risks for nothing; we will start again later, with the concern of both security and discretion. During this time, Wilhelm List observes the French cannons bludgeoning his armored points, and is annoyed as much by the lack of progress of his men as by the modesty of these Brandenburgers who do nothing useful!\n\nIt will take two days for Hartmann to succeed in taming the waves and proving him wrong, taking full advantage of the multiple German engagements all around him, which drain the French means, the attention of the defenders and the fire of their artillery. . On the night of July 12 to 13, the Brandenburgers finally infiltrated the wetlands north of the place called Les Robins, west of Châteauneuf-sur-Isère. Falling by night and in French uniforms on exhausted sentries, the Abwehr men (although they approached the sentries speaking English!) cleared a bridgehead about 500 meters wide, which would be very useful to the Heer forces to cross in inflatable boats before heading towards Valence and Romans.\n\nThere is currently no evidence that the 2. Kompanie participated in the fighting in Valence and the abuses that were committed there. Admittedly, it is possible, if not probable, that the Brandenburgers gave a few occasional helping hands to raise barricades or hedgehogs, as during the Polish campaign, but it is very doubtful that von Hippel nevertheless authorized his men to risk their life in simple urban combat retardants. Unfortunately, this did not change the outcome of the fighting and the Wehrmacht was finally able to surge south.\n\nMeanwhile, west of Grenoble, the 40 soldiers who had left three days earlier discreetly crossed the Vercors in small groups – avoiding patrols and villages, walking through woods and mountains to finally descend via Saint-Nizier-Du-Moucherotte towards Pariset, Seyssinet-Pariset and especially towards their objective: the fort de Comboire, an essential link in the old fortified belt west of Grenoble and which fires the 155 mm long cannon on the German waves rising to the assault. The work being what it is – located on a rocky outcrop between the Drac and the Vercors, in the middle of the forest – it is very difficult for the Stukas to silence it. No less than four positions lined with anti-aircraft weapons prevent the vultures from approaching.\n\nThe fort de Comboire nowadays\n\nFinally regrouped around the small village of Cossey, the 35 men *** spent the night of July 13 to 14 scouting. Recovering from here and there a dozen French uniforms, the Brandenburgers do what they know how to do best: infiltrate by taking advantage of the darkness and the confusion. Three of the four anti-aircraft batteries are silenced in less than an hour – the defenders did not expect to see soldiers in friendly uniform approaching from this direction. For the fourth, on the other hand, the closest to the fort, the task turns out to be more complicated... All this bustle of course puts the fort on alert, but far from coming out to help their comrades – which would have done the business of the detachment – the garrison takes refuge in the work and alerts the entire belt of infiltration in progress. And once the battery was destroyed, the Brandenburgers were therefore obliged to withdraw under cover of the woods, pending the continuation.\n\nIt will not be long: at 10:00 a.m., several Staffels of Stukas of StG.1 come to bludgeon the French artillery positions... Their anti-aircraft aircraft reduced to a few machine guns, the Comboire defenders can do nothing against the birds of misfortune which dive and destroy the most parts, finally silencing the position. It wouldn't have been long before the Germans discovered anyway that these batteries were running out of ammunition after so many days of fighting.\n\nMeanwhile, a little further north, the rest of the half-company is fighting south of the Chartreuse to help the Gebirgsjägers seize the Bastille fort, under the watchful eye of Néron. In the afternoon, the Bastille, then Comboire surrendered, definitively reduced to silence. In the valley, the Landsers have already forced the lock on the capitale des Alpes and are marching south to eliminate the part of the fortified belt facing south and Italy; this one, less garrisoned and oriented towards Italy - therefore the East - will pose much fewer problems. The Brandenburgers deployed in Grenoble will then render a few more minor services, in particular by reducing several fortified positions in Queyras, south of Briançon – but without taking too many risks. It would be doing too much service to the Regio Esercito when the Armée des Alpes, wedged between Germans and Italians, must retreat anyway.\n\nThe fort de la Bastille nowadays\n\nFor its part, and once the line of the Isère is forced, the rest of the 2. Kompanie accompanies the 12. Armee in its progression along the Rhône valley. He helped in the capture of Montélimar by confusing the retreating French troops with false signposts and by destroying or blocking several sections of mountain road in the south of the Drôme. On July 17, a group had their photo taken on the rocher de Pierrelatte – the weather was very nice and the Drôme Provençale is a beautiful region… The advance was ever more brisk (the Germans were in Bollène the next day!), the Brandenburgers hardly have the opportunity to shine. From time to time, they help clear the host of obstacles left by the retreating French – their pioneer training is very useful, since the unit will not mourn any deaths during this period, which will not be the case for everyone in the 12. Army. Even today, a tenacious rumor claims that Obergruppenführer Theodor Eicke would have disdainfully refused the offer made to him to assist him during his crossing of the Ardèche. Questioned much later on such a scenario, General Lambert disdainfully commented that if by chance the German army had sent 'its' Brandenburgers forward, they would have been at least as painfully surprised anyway by falling on the Chasseurs Ardennais: \"some might have had the right accent, but anyway, it wouldn't have been the right uniform...\" ****\n\nThe rocher de Pierrelatte nowadays\n\nThe rest of the campaign takes place along the Rhône. On July 26, the Brandenburgers of the 2. Kompanie – finally reunited – took the Col du Télégraphe at a run, which opened the way to the Etang de Berre, at the height of Salon-de-Provence. In this sector without opposition, they are very quickly overtaken by Panzers in a hurry to dip their tracks in the Vieux Port. The latter will nevertheless have to wait two days for the Vitrolles chain to be forced – here, the French troops are making their last square, and they know very well that they cannot be evacuated anyway…\n\nRemaining very fortunately for them far from the carnage of the infantry rising to the assault, Hartmann and his men attacked all the same on the night of July 27 - for lack of other available pioneers - the fort de Figuerolles, where the 178e Batterie d'Artillerie covers Marseilles. But the Germans were not very comfortable in the scrubland, stuck on a piece of rock between the sea and the front... It took them two days to overcome the fort, which fell on July 29, while the battle de Vitrolles ends – the last defenders will surrender to the regular forces of the Heer after two more days of resistance, trapped in galleries without water… The battery destroyed, Hartmann did not see fit to send men to look for them, while he has already lost 4 dead and several injured in the affair.\n\nThe fort de Figuerolles nowadays and it's wiew toward Marseille\n\nLet us take this opportunity to reaffirm a point: there is no trace of an attempt by the Brandenburgers to infiltrate as far as the port of Marseille in order to disrupt the Grand Déménagement – and it is even doubtful that they received the order. The reason is very simple: from July 20, the evacuation of the French forces still transferable is practically only carried out at night, in a city subjected to bombardments, teeming with soldiers with easy triggers, and in a port whose dockworkers – who all know each other, of course – are exhausted, nervous and often armed. Under these conditions, a few men injected into such an anthill would have been, at best, sent back to the front, at worst unmasked, unless a German bomb mowed them down on the way... Certainly, no doubt it is not impossible that he group was sent as lost children on July 12 – but such risk-taking for the sole pleasure of aggravating the chaos would still seem quite surprising… even if we will see a little further than the 1. Kompanie attempted actually something like that.\n\nAnyway, the campaign of France of the men of Hartmann stops in Toulon, on August 4, where their group is among the first to penetrate the Arsenal which has just capitulated. The Kriesgmarine – which is obviously linked with the Abwehr – still hopes to limit the destruction of the installations a little by a rapid takeover allowing the charges to be defused… Of course, this will not be the case. The 2. Kompanie will finally pack up to go up to Brandenburg an der Havel from the 10th.\n\n* Dialects from Togo or Cameroon. The faces of these men were blackened with shoe polish, but Hartmann chose to overlook the fact that most French “Senegalese” obviously do not speak the dialects in question!\n\n** As usual, the Heer chose not to let its tempo be imposed by such a small unit – moreover, attached to the navy and using despicable combat methods.\n\n*** A group of 5 men got lost on the way – they will never be found. It is still unknown today whether they were unmasked and shot as spies, victims of fire from a French detachment more nervous than the others... or machine-gunned by a marauding Stuka.\n\n**** Even today, resentment against German-speaking Belgians is tenacious among some veterans...\n\nThe Atlantic coast – full speed ahead\n\nFor the 1. Kompanie of the Oberleutnant der Reserve Kniesche, made available to the 4. and 18. Armee (at the rate of half a company per army), the situation is quite different. In the Atlantic sector, the French had hardly any relief on which to entrench themselves and even fewer forts to serve as support... already next. Indeed, if they can only play a small role in the fight to break through the line of defense, it is up to them on the other hand to sow chaos in the enemy rear and to hinder its movements by proceeding in small independent groups.\n\nThe course of events will help them. While the front cracked on the 14th and finally gave way on the 16th, the possibilities of infiltrating through the woods of Limousin or even the Charente multiplied. Kniesche's groups, disguised in French uniforms, assault command posts, creating confusion and their mere presence - \"The Fifth Column!\" – makes the French believe that the breakthrough is much wider and deeper than it really is. But, beyond this little war, the Brandenburgers none the less mounted an assault on the most strategic positions, from the start of the offensive and with varying success: on the 14th, at Rochefort, they failed to just in front of the suspension bridge of Tonnay-Charente – mined for a long time, the latter jumps at the last moment thanks to the stubborn resistance of the marines of Rear-Admiral Jardel.\n\nThe suspension bridge of Tonnay-Charente before destruction.\n\nOn the other hand, on the 15th, in Châteauneuf-sur-Charente, Kniesche's men seized a road structure, arriving at full speed from the rear on captured vehicles to discreetly cut the wires of the charges. The artificer in charge of the shot will have the misfortune to hesitate a few seconds too long... It will nevertheless take very hard fights to allow the Panzers to pass.\n\nOnce the front is irreparably dislocated, the brandenburgers must adapt. Faced with a much more fluid situation than their comrades in the east of the country, they will now focus on disrupting the retreat of the French army as much as possible. Sections of 5 to 10 men (always in French uniforms) overtake the troops which fall back, or even join them to multiply the sabotages. Sugar appears in the reservoirs, the switches of the railways are blocked and the tank trucks explode without the gendarmerie being able to do much about it... At Chalus, disguised – precisely – as gendarmes, Kniesche's men completely drove unfortunate columns of refugees who were sent back into the path of the 7th Army, no doubt contributing to its subsequent partial encirclement. Obviously, all these crimes only increased the size and reputation of the famous 5th Column... Confronted from then on by soldiers who systematically treated the isolated groups encountered as enemies, the Brandenburgers ended up having to be discreet and relax their talons - because of the atmosphere of paranoia that they largely contributed to create.\n\nOn July 16, in Nexon, a section was unmasked by retired Spanish volunteers thanks to the indications of a Limousin civilian less paralyzed than the others by the situation, and who wondered about this astonishing group of soldiers who spoke little but requisitioned telephones and fuel… In the exchange of fire which followed, the Germans abandoned a dead man and a wounded man, who was taken prisoner – he owed his salvation only to the rapid intervention of the local gendarmerie and a Army Captain...\n\nAnother case, unfortunately very different: the same day, in Libourne, German refugees trying to cross the Gironde are taken for saboteurs because of their accent. They suffered numerous shots from the section responsible for the defense of the structure, before being interrogated bluntly. We will deplore 4 wounded - by bullets or by ill-treatment - before the arrival of the military police allows things to calm down and the unfortunates to be freed... This painful episode will unfortunately not be the only one: more than one isolated soldier stopping in a village to ask for a drink or else the phone will be beaten up by locals screaming at the spy…\n\nNevertheless, and regardless of post-war literature, it is doubtful that the Brandenburgers had the means – both human and technical – to contribute to the resumption of air raids on Toulouse \"by following the fighters to flush out their advanced terrain” (according to some authors). It is difficult to see how such a tactic could have succeeded. And anyway, the bombardments resumed on July 20, while the Brandenburgers were still between Bordeaux and Cahors.\n\nBe that as it may, now that the panzers are rushing towards the Gironde without the adversary being able to stop them, the problem becomes just as much to slow down the French army (Kniesche will go so far as to propose destroying certain bridges! ) than to prevent the destruction by the enemy of his own industrial installations. In Berlin, in the premises of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, one looks with envy at the Bloch factories on the outskirts of Bordeaux, which continue to turn against all odds. As for the Kriegsmarine, it rightly considers that anything that will not be scuttled in the Gironde estuary should not be dredged up later...\n\nTheir hopes will be in vain: on July 17, Rommel's 7. Panzer Division seizes Royan and the mouth of the Gironde - thus rendering the port industrial installations almost useless for the French, who take measures accordingly. And when on July 19, the Heer finally forced its way through Libourne, the Brandenburgers rushed west to find nothing intact. The entry into Bordeaux on July 21 is made under a sky of ashes…\n\nNevertheless, what was missed on the Atlantic coast, Kniesche can still hope to succeed in Toulouse by overtaking the French. Abandoning the sterile fighting in the Landes where he could in any case do nothing except lose people, he rushed ahead of the motorized units of the Heer with a column of recovery trucks or armored cars, deploying the french flag in front of him. tricolor. Sometimes, traffic jams open in front of his troop… sometimes, the latter is greeted with gunfire. However, with no organized defense until Agen, the Brandenburgers are moving fast.\n\nOn July 26, they are already in Colomiers and then set a trap for one of the last convoys leaving the Dewoitine factory by directing it on a road of no return... The Germans thus recover piles of documents on the Dewoitine projects. A real success, but marginal. In the surrounding chaos, while the evacuations or destructions have already been largely carried out, the Brandenburgers could hardly do better than wait for the panzers until July 28... Their campaign will end in the Pyrenees, trying to ban passage to Spain for the last fugitives.\n\nFor the Bau-Lehr-Bataillon “Brandenburg”, as for the entire Wehrmacht, the campaign was therefore a huge success, although tinged with a little bitterness. Admittedly, they triumphed over all their adversaries, achieved all their geographical objectives and conquered France… but this victory is not complete: like all the other occupied countries, France continues the war. The Brandenburg lost 12 killed, including 2 non-commissioned officers, and 10 seriously wounded. It's expensive to pay – and even if the fights have a break in Europe, we will have to prepare for the sequel.\n\nSeelöwe, Felix… chimeras\n\nIn September 1940, it is hard to see what operation the Wehrmacht could launch before next spring. For the time being, Africa or even Corsica are far away – and the Axis navies are struggling in the Mediterranean against the Royal Navy and the Marine Nationale.\n\nFor lack of the possibility of crossing the “great blue cemetery”, the OKW now plans to land in England or to seize Gibraltar, with the assistance of Nationalist Spain… or even without! The Brandenburgers take advantage of the break to strengthen themselves, while carefully studying more or less fanciful plans.\n\nThey will be able to count on reinforcements - as of May 15, in view of the excellent results obtained in the Benelux, Admiral Canaris ordered to change Bau-Lehr-Bataillon “Brandenburg” to regiment format. After grouping together the various combat units of the battalion, the latter will be “inflated” by drawing from the pool of Heer volunteers, always numerous, reinforced by Volksdeutsches from Italy (Tyrol) or even… from the USSR (Bukovina) repatriated following bilateral agreements.\n\nIn the somewhat chaotic conditions of August 1940, it is easy to understand that the new Brandenburg Regiment (like the entire Wehrmacht) was absolutely not ready to go into action in September. The Abwehr then decided to take advantage of this extended truce to create new specialized companies within the Brandenburger, intended to intervene in all possible theaters of operations*.\n\nAll winter 40-41, the Brandenburgers trained for Seelöwe – even though the OKW had in fact abandoned this project. Attached to the 16. Armee and 6. Armee, the brand new I. and III. Battalions of the Lehr-Regiment Brandenburg z.b.V. 800 prepare on the island of Heligoland to carry out amphibious assaults, while receiving English lessons and British uniforms. The two battalions even have their designated objectives: the I. will have to destroy the locks of Folkestone and secure the Dungeness peninsula; the III. will have to conquer the radar station of Weymouth, in Dorset. Obviously, nothing will come out of these exercises, except an experience that will be very useful... elsewhere.\n\nOperation Felix – the capture of the Rock of Gibraltar – seems on the other hand a much more serious eventuality, at least initially. Admittedly, Franco simpered and marketed (from Berlin's point of view) his entry into the war against the Allies, but in any case (and always from Berlin's point of view) the German forces could force their way south without difficulty. .. Admiral Canaris, whom a sincere friendship binds to the Caudillo, nevertheless hopes that the latter will rally to the Axis – moreover, the latter did not give him his agreement so that he sends staff to Madrid to collect all useful information for the future?\n\nThe head of the Abwehr even went there in person at the end of August, accompanied by Oberst Hans Piekenbrock (head of Abteilung I of the Abwehr – foreign intelligence). They will be joined a little later by the Hauptmann Rudolf, past head of the III. Battalion of the Brandenburger and whose perfect knowledge of Spanish (despite South American twists) works wonders, as well as by Oberleutnant Hans Mikosch, veteran of the capture of Eben-Emael. So many glorious specialists supposed to reassure Spain on the speed and effectiveness of a possible action... In Algeciras, the Germans will spend long moments in scouting, while their leader discusses with Franco in person.\n\nIf the Francoists rally to the Axis, Felix must mobilize two German army corps: a motorized one, intended to cover a possible British reaction from Portugal, and a mountain one (1. GebirgsJägerDivision **, Régiment GroßDeutschland and Pionnier-Bataillon (mot.) 51), charged with the capture of the Rock proper. For this, the Brandenburgers must provide 100 men and 2 English-speaking officers, who will have to infiltrate, blow up the barbed wire network, secure the main access roads and prevent at all costs the destruction of the east-west tunnel passing under the fortress. Tasks, of course, to be carried out in British uniform, after insertion by speedboats. Other groups are also supposed to sow chaos according to custom, by blowing up fuel tanks, the power plant, repair shops...\n\nUnder the direction of Leutnant Hettinger and Oberleutnant Thun, the chosen men will settle in Biarritz for training coupled with regular (and tolerated) incursions into Spanish territory in order to conduct scouting there. Despite the questionable results of the Hitler-Franco meeting of October 23, these preparations would continue until February 1941 before being totally abandoned.\n\n*In this beginning of splitting, the Gebirgsjägers will be the first to distinguish themselves – in particular by the return of the Bergmütze and the Edelweiss insignia.\n\n** Who will train briefly in Besançon to prepare for this operation.\n\nRomania: friendly matches and non-public takeover bids\n\nBefore returning to the campaign, other more trivial tasks – although no less strategic – however awaited the unit: in this case the guard, undercover, of major industrial sites located in foreign territory. Indeed, during the first years of the conflict, and despite the efforts of the entire chemical industry of the Reich, Germany remained totally dependent for its fuel on foreign suppliers – namely, essentially the USSR and Romania. And one of these partners being doomed to… eventually cease its exchanges, Bucharest was of course only more important in the campaigns to come! It is well known that, from October 20, 1940, German troops were deployed in this country to ensure the safety of the wells which served the Reich ever more widely. It is less so that the Abwehr went well beyond this protection, settling in Romania (as early as 1939!) for political and strategic reasons.\n\nIndeed, between 1939 and 1941, and even if the country of Carol II slipped irreparably on the Axis, Germany was still a very far minority in the control of the oil installations of the country. Evidenced by the distribution of oil capital at the end of 1939: 43% Romanian shareholders, 45% English, French, Belgians and Dutch, 9% Americans, 3% Italians and … 0.2 % of Germans.\n\nObviously, at the end of the summer of 1940, Germany had hastened to have the Laval government sign the transfer of its shares as “war reparations”. But Bucharest would not dare to recognize this step until November 1940 - in the meantime, London and Algiers had signed an agreement for the temporary transfer of their shares to American companies *. Thus, the majority of the Romanian oil industry, essential to the German war effort, did indeed belong to powers neutral or even hostile to the Reich. Curious situation – and Romania swarming with foreign nationals, it is easy to understand that there was fear in Berlin of the sabotage, even the destruction of factories of which it was nevertheless hoped to recover full ownership in the long term.\n\nTo counter such a scenario, a team of Brandenburgers commanded by the Feldwebel Gustl Süss had therefore gone to Bucharest in the winter of 39-40 to audit (we would say today) the security of the installations and prepare for the arrival of reinforcements. substantial: 60 men from the Deutsche Kompanie z.b.V. from Sliač, transferred in small groups and disguised as Czech workers, with the blessing of the Siguranța. These teams initially had to physically protect the purely Romanian refineries – including Astra Română in particular – against any attempt at sabotage. In truth, they would also very quickly crisscross the trains (disguised as railway workers) and even indulge in a kind of pimping to try to extract confessions on the pillow from Franco-British nationals! Their investigations were to lead to the arrest of a hundred British saboteurs, whose project would have been to obstruct the Danube (!) by scuttling ships there then by striking down the cliffs of Kazan… Nothing less!\n\nMoreni Oilfields and Astra Română refinery circa 1941\n\nThis activity of the Brandenburgers was obviously to increase with the continuation of the war. In October 1940, the Brandenburg received the order to make its Romanian, Hungarian or Bulgarian-speaking personnel available, in order to distribute them all along the oil supply chain, from the terminals to the river and rail depots. The Germans were not long in playing their role, sometimes disguised as simple civilians, sometimes as railwaymen, sometimes as policemen (accompanied by a member of the Siguranța). Beyond their surveillance activities, they also endeavored to discredit the French, English and Americans with Romanian public opinion by concealing weapons or explosives in the belongings of people who were then to be reported anonymously to the police, or even directly in the Shell or Essolub tugboats, subsequently raided on the denunciation of a good citizen... A vast program because, to the chagrin of Marshal Antonescu, all the personnel of the oil installations were not Germanophiles, far from there ! A Romanian petrochemical company was even outright murdered for having planned to plug wells with concrete reinforced with steel balls.\n\nOn November 23, 1940, Romania finally emerged from ambiguity by signing the Tripartite Pact – a pact one clause of which provided for the delivery of 90% of oil production to Berlin. As of November 24, 1940, Bucharest would expel all nationals of Allied countries. However, it remained to guard against a backlash from the SOE or the French services, with the possible help of Romanians, or even American or even Soviet agents. To protect itself, the 6. Kompanie (Oberleutnant Meissner) launched Operation Wiking on December 1, 1940: 125 men and 3 officers settled on the left bank of the Danube, at Roussé (in Bulgarian territory), opposite the terminal. of Giurgiu. It was a question of strengthening the Reich's control over oil supplies, but discreetly and above all without offending Moscow, a gesture of humor always seemed possible.\n\nA sign of this tartufferie, also intended to somewhat preserve the fiction of Romanian neutrality and Bulgarian independence **, the Brandenburgers therefore invited themselves to Roussé as… a football team awaiting authorization to enter Romania . A very mediocre team, whose results will not be up to a strangely overstaffed workforce. The “footballers” will finally go to Romania on January 10, 1941, where they will then have the task of monitoring the American installations while the Flak and the Heer will in turn ensure the protection of the other installations. This arrangement would definitely end with Germany's declaration of war on the United States on December 11, 1941 - although some Brandenburgers would later remain on site as instructors seconded to the Romanian army during the winter of 1941-42. However, in this region of the world, it is not from Romania that the surprise would come. Indeed, on February 19, 1941, when the bulk of Brandenburg was already engaged (a little) in Merkur and (much more) in the preparation of Barbarossa, Greece declared war on Italy!\n\nBrandenburgers in Bulgarian uniforms during the surveillance of the refineries in 41:\n\n*Obviously outrageously favorable to these, but it was still better than a seizure...\n\n** At the same time, the first elements of the 8. Kompanie entered Bulgaria to ensure the protection of its sensitive sites (power stations, dams, stations, etc.).\n\n25” or how to destroy a nation\n\nAs usual, the objectives entrusted to the Brandenburgers are above all intended to support the advance of the Panzer Divisions to strike down Yugoslavia: bridges, above all – but not only.\n\nIndeed, Admiral Canaris personally ordered the unit to support Pionier-Bataillon 651 (Oberst Bazing) responsible for seizing the Iron Gates, the famous point of passage for those who want to go up the Danube. Fifty Brandenburgers are made available to the pioneers – a mixed commando will leave from the Romanian airfield of Mehadica on the night of May 3. The plan is simple: force the Danube in Sturmboots* at the level of Orșova, seize any fortifications there and above all prevent the Yugoslavs from scuttling in the river the barges loaded with cement and sand that they have specifically gathered for this purpose. The Brandenburgers will make it a point of honor to show themselves to be worthy of their reputation: ahead of the Pioneers, they climb to attack the enemy positions, silently eliminating the sentries, before suddenly charging the strongpoints and the docks in a surprisingly short, successful assault with no casualties! Disappointed to have met so little resistance, the group then pushed towards Tekija and Novi Sip, then Petrovo Selo and Kladovo – but met no further opposition. In fact, the Royal Yugoslav Army has other concerns than recapturing the Iron Gates…\n\nBecause the Reich strikes hard, very hard even. Learning from the example of the First World War, Hitler wanted to take the kingdom by storm in order to stifle the mobilization of the numerous Yugoslav army and thus spare himself an interminable struggle in the mountains of Bosnia or Montenegro - not to mention the upcoming campaign in Greece. In the mind of the dictator, “25” is just a contingency; it must be carried out efficiently and brutally, to end it as quickly as possible. For this task and the one that will follow, the German special forces are plethoric: 380 men divided into six commandos!\n\nHere too, the Brandenburgers are keen to grant the wishes of the Guide, in particular the 5. Gebirgsjäger-Kompanie (Oberleutnant Kniesche). Deployed on the Slovenian border for the benefit of the 2nd Army, the latter must ensure the rapid seizure of the passageways to the south. Leaving from Rosenbach (Austria), the soldiers of the half-company of Leutnant Rolf Hettinger crossed the mountain on foot to surprise the Yugoslavs in the early morning defending the southern exit of the Karawanken tunnel – 7,800 meters long, the latter allows Avoid crossing the Wurzen or Loibl passes, which are strongly defended. Eight men commanded by Leutnant Paul Gebbers single-handedly neutralize the tunnel guards... but the structure was destroyed the day before! A shot in the dark then – but it was up to the Brandenburgers to lead the way.\n\nDespite this setback, the Germans hurriedly crossed Slovenia – little contested because deemed indefensible – to enter Croatia and make the most of the confusion generated by the Croatian mutinies, which took on a catastrophic scale. The 4th Yugoslav Army, although supposed to defend this region, collapses. In 24 hours, three regiments have already turned their heads and are marching towards Zagreb, against their leaders the day before, in favor of an Ustashi state! 48 hours after the start of the offensive, the Yugoslav army no longer exists in central Croatia – between mutinies, desertions, sabotage, delay in mobilization and (also…) combat, the formation supposed to defend the sector against an entire army German has fallen to less than 20% of its workforce! On May 7, 1941, the Brandenburgers were among the first to enter the new capital of the NDH, welcomed (this is new) with flowers and thanks. A new friendship between peoples, therefore, which was unfortunately not going to stop there...\n\nYugoslav reservists captured while joining their units, in 41:\n\nNot really the regiment, but it gives an idea of the atmosphere - Panzers pass in front of the gebirgsjäger somewhere in the Balkans...\n\nHettinger's half-company, however, continued without delay towards the southwest, amid the loyalist debris fleeing towards Bosnia. On May 9, she is already in Karlovac. Lacking resistance (while in the south, the Franco-British forces were moving towards Macedonia and the Metaxas line), the Brandenburgers advanced very quickly. On May 11, they finally joined north of Fiume with the Italian 2nd Army, which was descending along the Adriatic towards Mostar and Albania. The Germans then assisted the latter in the reduction of some redoubts in Delnice and Jasenice, where Serbian forces led a hopeless fight against three adversaries at once!\n\nFurther east, the Brandenburgers of the Belgrade sector ** are not left out – although their objectives are very different. A small group infiltrates the Serbian capital during its brief siege to seize the archives of the Ministry of Defense. A task accomplished brilliantly, as of May 9, and which will have significant consequences on the attitude of a certain number of Chetnik leaders in the years to come. But for now, the most important thing is not on the Danube, but well to the south, where a small province unknown to everyone, if not to history – Macedonia – will become the center of many struggles.\n\n* Fast Assault Boats.\n\n** Deployed alongside the XLVI.ArmeeKorps (mot)."
