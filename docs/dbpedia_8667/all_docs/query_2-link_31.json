        "text": "This volume shows the panorama of the contemporary studies of the Polish Renaissance, presented here in the Italian and South European and transalpine context, taking into consideration its characteristics. An important aspect of this volume is the specification of the research needs and the definition of new directions of studies and their methodology. A large, multiethnic and multireligious state, which was Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów) shaped its modern identity in the 16th century. This period gave rise to the flowering of literature and art, creating the Golden Age of Polish culture. The ideas of Renaissance humanism proved to be vitally attractive for the domestic elites and contributed to the creation of the foundations of the political system of the Commonwealth, becoming its pride – a republic with an elected king, where both passive and active electoral rights were vested in the entire Gentry Nation. The Latin Culture of the Renaissance became also an integrating factor for this multilingual state organism, and Latin, together with Polish was the main medium of communication among nobility (who accounted for about 10% of the inhabitants of the Republic). The disintegration of this commonwealth, the loss of independence for more than a century (1795-1918), and then loss of sovereignty for another half of a century (1939-1989) and then isolation between Poland and the West resulted in the fact that the culture of this area was not included in the studies of the European Renaissance, which were commenced in the 19th century. This gap has been seen until today in the Western course books and more general overviews. The purpose of this volume is, at least to a limited degree, to fill in the lack of scientific analyses of the Polish Renaissance in western languages and also to invite foreign scholars to a debate about Polish humanistic literature. Particular chapters concentrate on the following issues: From the History of the Renaissance Idea; The State of Research on the Renaissance Humanism: Poland Case; Editing of Primary Sources; Old and Contemporary Translation Studies; The Renaissance Genres (Theory and Practice).

An important aspect of this volume is the specification of the research needs and the definition of new directions of studies and their methodology. A large, multiethnic and multireligious state, which was Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narod?w) shaped its modern identity in the sixteenth century. This period gave rise to the flowering of literature and art, creating the Golden Age of Polish culture. The ideas of Renaissance humanism proved to be vitally attractive for the domestic elites and contributed to the creation of the foundations of the political system of the Commonwealth, becoming its pride--a republic with an elected king, where both passive and active electoral rights were vested in the entire Gentry Nation. The Latin Culture of the Renaissance became also an int...\n\nThe present study offers a re-evaluation of literary production in Hungary under the Jagiellonian kings Wladislas II and Louis II. Traditionally, the literary works produced in this period have been contrasted to the blossoming of humanist literature under King Matthias, and disregarded in many respects. The aim of this study is to make a survey of the main authors and other agents of the literary culture of this period and to stress that this age experienced an unseen growth and expansion in late medieval and humanist scholarly and lay culture. While János Horváth called the authors of this period \"humanists with party allegiances\", I argue that their stronger \"party allegiance\" is, in fact, the direct result of the steady growth in the number of intellectuals with a modern, humanistic educational outlook, and of a less centralized state.\n\nThe main purpose of the paper is to provide a bilingual (Latin – English) edition of a brief essay De ratione studii (On the Programme of Studies) by Stanislaus Sokołowski (1537–1593), a professor of rhetoric at the Academy of Cracow and a royal preacher at Stephen Báthory’s court. A short introduction examines the rhetorical strategies used by the author in the description of “good letters” (bonae litterae) and “more humane studies” (humaniora). It also considers the place of rhetoric in humanist studies. Sokołowski and many Renaissance authors of educational treatises combined studies in three verbal arts (artes sermocinales: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic) with aspirations to moral excellence (virtue). In this way, the praise of “good letters” turns out to be the praise of man. The transcription, translation, and some notes on the text are presented in the second part of this paper."
