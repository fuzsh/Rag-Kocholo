Expected impact level of the Programme is improved business relations and economic activities of participating companies. The paper is addressing the problem:,,successful implementation of the projects does not ensure sustainability of the achieved results at cross-border level,,. The primary research is testing the attitudes of various groups of beneficiaries regarding achieved impact of projects on cross-border cooperation and on strengthened competitiveness of participating SME companies. Findings from secondary research correspond to results from the primary research. Cross-border cooperation program/project management needs capacity upscaling in order to maintain achieved projects results and to establish long-term partnership."
