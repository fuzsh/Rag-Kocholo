        "text": "The Correlation between the Scores of Written Examination, the Clinical Clerkship Examination, the Clinical Skill Assessment, and the Graduation Examination of the Medical Students.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoh, Suk Bong; Park, Hye Jin\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate correlations between medical student scores on 4 examinations: the written examination, clinical clerkship examination, clinical skill assessment, and graduation examination. Scores for 51 students who entered Daegu Catholic Medical School in 2005 on the written examination, clinical clerkship examination, clinical skill assessment, and graduation examination were included. Correlations between the scores were analyzed statistically. The scores on the written examination showed a strong correlation with those of the clinical clerkship assessment (0.833) and graduation examination (0.821). The clinical clerkship assessment scores correlated significantly with graduation examination scores (0.907). In addition, clinical skill assessment scores correlated with the written examination (0.579), clinical clerkship examination (0.570), and graduation examination (0.465) scores. Overall, the correlation between the scores on the clinical clerkship examination and the written examination was more significant than the correlation between scores on the clinical clerkship examination and clinical skill assessment. Therefore, we need to improve the evaluation method for the clinical clerkship examination and clinical skill assessment.\n\nAn Optometric Clinical Practicum Examination Model.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEskridge, Jess B.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA practical clinical examination model for use by state board examiners in optometry is described including purpose, format, examination design, procedures, evaluation examples and administration. (JMF)\n\nClinical examiners, simulated patients, and student self-assessed empathy in medical students during a psychiatry objective structured clinical examination.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Connor, Karen; King, Romaine; Malone, Kevin M; Guerandel, Allys\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThis study aims to assess and compare objective and subjective scores of empathy in final-year medical students by using firstly a validated student self-assessment just prior to the psychiatry objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and then comparing this to clinical examiner's and simulated patient's (SP's) assessments of empathy of students using a Global Rating of Empathy scale (GRE) during a psychiatry OSCE. In 2011, all final-year medical students in the University College Dublin were invited to complete a subjective, self-assessed empathy questionnaire (The Jefferson scale of physician empathy-student version (JSPE-S)). They were also assessed for empathy in four OSCEs by the clinical examiner and the SP acting in that OSCE scenario. Included in the analysis were 163 of 184 final-year students JSPE-S (88.6%) questionnaires. The female students scores on the JSPE-S were significantly higher than those of their male peers (t=3.34, p=0.001). Concurrent validity was greater between the SPs' assessments of empathy in the OSCE and the JSPE-S score than between the clinical examiners assessments of empathy and the JSPE-S score (r=0.23, p<0.005; r=0.14, p<0.08). Inter-rater reliability of SP's and clinical examiner's using the GRE was found to be high (F=0.868 (df=171, 171), p value<0.001). SPs may be valid assessors of empathy in medical students during an OSCE.\n\nPerformance in physical examination on the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills examination.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeitzman, Steven J; Cuddy, Monica M\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo provide descriptive information about history-taking (HX) and physical examination (PE) performance for U.S. medical students as documented by standardized patients (SPs) during the Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) component of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. The authors examined two hypotheses: (1) Students perform worse in PE compared with HX, and (2) for PE, students perform worse in the musculoskeletal system and neurology compared with other clinical domains. The sample included 121,767 student-SP encounters based on 29,442 examinees from U.S. medical schools who took Step 2 CS for the first time in 2011. The encounters comprised 107 clinical presentations, each categorized into one of five clinical domains: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and respiratory. The authors compared mean percent-correct scores for HX and PE via a one-tailed paired-samples t test and examined mean score differences by clinical domain using analysis of variance techniques. Average PE scores (59.6%) were significantly lower than average HX scores (78.1%). The range of scores for PE (51.4%-72.7%) was larger than for HX (74.4%-81.0%), and the standard deviation for PE scores (28.3) was twice as large as the HX standard deviation (14.7). PE performance was significantly weaker for musculoskeletal and neurological encounters compared with other encounters. U.S. medical students perform worse on PE than HX; PE performance was weakest in musculoskeletal and neurology clinical domains. Findings may reflect imbalances in U.S. medical education, but more research is needed to fully understand the relationships among PE instruction, assessment, and proficiency.\n\nUse of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination in Clinical Nurse Specialist Education.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuevas, Heather E; Timmerman, Gayle M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHelping patients maximize their potential using expert coaching to facilitate lifestyle change is an important practice area for clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). The purpose is to determine the usefulness of objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) for evaluating CNS students' coaching competencies in the context of facilitating lifestyle change. Despite the use of OSCEs to assess competencies in clinical skills (eg, performance of procedures, decision making), its potential for evaluating coaching competencies for lifestyle change has not been demonstrated. We developed 4 OSCEs dealing with coaching patients in exercise, weight loss, stress reduction, or nonpharmacologic management of hyperlipidemia. Evaluation criteria included (1) approach to the patient, (2) information gathering, (3) motivational interviewing, and (4) management (medical and behavioral strategies). Student performance ranged from highly organized with proficient coaching skills to disorganized and focused solely on clinical management and prescriptive communication. Student responses were positive. Objective structured clinical examinations were highly useful for evaluating CNS students' coaching competencies for lifestyle change. Using OSCEs early in the semester to provide students feedback on their performance and again at the end to determine improvement optimizes use of this teaching strategy.\n\nClinical examination of subjects with halitosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonaldson, A C; Riggio, M P; Rolph, H J; Bagg, J; Hodge, P J\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo develop and apply a detailed clinical protocol for screening and assessing subjects with a complaint of halitosis. Cross-sectional. Several methods were used to recruit subjects with a complaint of halitosis, including a newspaper advertisement. A definition of halitosis arising from within the oral cavity, which is not related to generalized chronic gingivitis, chronic periodontitis or pathology of the oral mucosa was used. An extensive list of exclusion criteria was applied at the initial visit. Eligible subjects were asked to follow strict instructions and complete a questionnaire prior to their second visit for data collection. The clinical examination consisted of an organoleptic assessment, Halimeter reading and periodontal examination. The best method of recruiting subjects was advertising. Of 66 individuals recruited, four failed to attend the screening visit and 25 were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were poor oral hygiene and existing periodontal disease. Thirty-seven completed the full protocol, resulting in identification of 18 with halitosis and 19 controls. Application of the exclusion criteria resulted in significant attrition of eligible participants. Our results suggest that organoleptic assessment should be regarded as a useful standard for defining subjects with halitosis.\n\nExamination to assess the clinical examination and documentation of spine pathology among orthopedic residents.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaglin, Jack M; Zeller, John L; Egol, Kenneth A; Phillips, Donna P\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines requires residency programs to teach and evaluate residents in six overarching \"core competencies\" and document progress through educational milestones. To assess the progress of orthopedic interns' skills in performing a history, physical examination, and documentation of the encounter for a standardized patient with spinal stenosis, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was conducted for 13 orthopedic intern residents, following a 1-month boot camp that included communications skills and curriculum in history and physical examination. Interns were objectively scored based on their performance of the physical examination, communication skills, completeness and accuracy of their electronic medical record (EMR), and their diagnostic conclusions gleaned from the patient encounter. The purpose of this study was to meaningfully assess the clinical skills of orthopedic post-graduate year (PGY)-1 interns. The findings can be used to develop a standardized curriculum for documenting patient encounters and highlight common areas of weakness among orthopedic interns with regard to the spine history and physical examination and conducting complete and accurate clinical documentation. A major orthopedic specialty hospital and academic medical center. Thirteen PGY-1 orthopedic residents participated in the OSCE with the same standardized patient presenting with symptoms and radiographs consistent with spinal stenosis. Videos of the encounters were independently viewed and objectively evaluated by one investigator in the study. This evaluation focused on the completeness of the history and the performance and completion of the physical examination. The standardized patient evaluated the communication skills of each intern with a separate objective evaluation. Interns completed these same scoring guides to evaluate their own performance in history, physical examination, and communications\n\nComputer assisted Objective structured clinical examination versus Objective structured clinical examination in assessment of Dermatology undergraduate students.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaudhary, Richa; Grover, Chander; Bhattacharya, S N; Sharma, Arun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe assessment of dermatology undergraduates is being done through computer assisted objective structured clinical examination at our institution for the last 4 years. We attempted to compare objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and computer assisted objective structured clinical examination (CA-OSCE) as assessment tools. To assess the relative effectiveness of CA-OSCE and OSCE as assessment tools for undergraduate dermatology trainees. Students underwent CA-OSCE as well as OSCE-based evaluation of equal weightage as an end of posting assessment. The attendance as well as the marks in both the examination formats were meticulously recorded and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Intercooled Stata V9.0 was used to assess the reliability and internal consistency of the examinations conducted. Feedback from both students and examiners was also recorded. The mean attendance for the study group was 77% Â± 12.0%. The average score on CA- OSCE and OSCE was 47.4% Â± 19.8% and 53.5% Â± 18%, respectively. These scores showed a mutually positive correlation, with Spearman's coefficient being 0.593. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between attendance scores and assessment score was 0.485 for OSCE and 0.451 for CA-OSCE. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all the tests ranged from 0.76 to 0.87 indicating high reliability. The comparison was based on a single batch of 139 students. Such an evaluation on more students in larger number of batches over successive years could help throw more light on the subject. Computer assisted objective structured clinical examination was found to be a valid, reliable and effective format for dermatology assessment, being rated as the preferred format by examiners.\n\nPhysical Examination for the Academic Psychiatrist: Primer and Common Clinical Scenarios.\n\nPubMed\n\nAzzam, Pierre N; Gopalan, Priya; Brown, Jennifer R; Aquino, Patrick R\n\n2016-04-01\n\nAs clinical psychiatry has evolved to mirror the patient care model followed in other medical specialties, psychiatrists are called upon increasingly to utilize general medical skills in routine practice. Psychiatrists who practice in academic settings are often required to generate broad differential diagnoses that include medical and neurologic conditions and, as a result, benefit from incorporating physical examination into their psychiatric assessments. Physical examination allows psychiatrists to follow and to teach patient-informed clinical practices and comprehensive treatment approaches. In this commentary, the authors encourage routine use of a targeted physical examination and outline common scenarios in which physical examination would be useful for the academic psychiatrist: delirium, toxidromes, and unexplained medical conditions (e.g., somatic symptom disorders).\n\nClinical versus ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland in common clinical practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrander, A; Viikinkoski, P; Tuuhea, J; Voutilainen, L; Kivisaari, L\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn a prospective series of 72 patients, clinical and ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland were compared in detail. Normal-sized lobes were differentiated from enlarged ones both by inspection and by palpation. When lobar size was assessed by palpation, the estimate was most clearly influenced by increase in width. The correlation between two examiners in lobe size assessment was significant. In the classification of thyroid disease as diffuse, solitary, or multinodular, clinical examination and ultrasonography correlated significantly. However, only one third of the clinically solitary nodules proved to be solitary by ultrasound examination. Of 77 separate nodules, 43 escaped detection on clinical examination. Of these 43, 14 nodules exceeded 2 cm in diameter. It is concluded that the use of ultrasonography frequently alters the primary evaluation of thyroid nodularity based on palpation.\n\n[Clinical examination and the Valsalva maneuver in heart failure].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiniado, Guillermo E; Beck, MartÃ­n A; Gimeno, Graciela M; GonzÃ¡lez, Ana L; Cianciulli, TomÃ¡s F; Castiello, Gustavo G; Gagliardi, Juan A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCongestion in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is relevant and closely linked to the clinical course. Bedside blood pressure measurement during the Valsalva maneuver (Val) added to clinical examination may improve the assessment of congestion when compared to NT-proBNP levels and left atrial pressure (LAP) estimation by Doppler echocardiography, as surrogate markers of congestion in HFrEF. A clinical examination, LAP and blood tests were performed in 69 HFrEF ambulatory patients with left ventricular ejection fraction â¤ 40% and sinus rhythm. Framingham Heart Failure Score (HFS) was used to evaluate clinical congestion; Val was classified as normal or abnormal, NT-proBNP was classified as low (< 1000 pg/ml) or high (â¥ 1000 pg/ml) and the ratio between Doppler early mitral inflow and tissue diastolic velocity was used to estimate LAP and was classified as low (E/e'< 15) or high (E/e' â¥ 15). A total of 69 patients with HFrEF were included; 27 had a HFS â¥ 2 and 13 of them had high NT-proBNP. HFS â¥ 2 had a 62% sensitivity, 70% specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.08 (p=0.01) to detect congestion. When Val was added to clinical examination, the presence of a HFS â¥ 2 and abnormal Val showed a 100% sensitivity, 64% specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.8 (p = 0.0004). Compared with LAP, the presence of HFS = 2 and abnormal Val had 86% sensitivity, 54% specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.86 (p = 0.03). In conclusion, an integrated clinical examination with the addition Valsalva maneuver may improve the assessment of congestion in patients with HFrEF.\n\nThe Clinical anatomy of the physical examination of the abdomen: A comprehensive review.\n\nPubMed\n\nBilal, Muhammad; Voin, Vlad; Topale, Nitsa; Iwanaga, Joe; Loukas, Marios; Tubbs, R Shane\n\n2017-04-01\n\nPhysical examination of the abdomen is an essential skill. Knowledge of its clinical anatomy and application is vital for making diagnoses. Misinterpretation of anatomy during examination can have serious consequences. This review addresses understanding of the anatomy, methodology, and complications of abdominal physical examination. It includes particular reference to modern technology and investigations. Physical examination is performed for diagnostic purposes. However, the art of physical examination is declining as more and more clinicians rely on newer technology. This can have regrettable consequences: negligence, waste of time and resources, and deterioration of clinical skills. With a sound knowledge of clinical anatomy, and realization of the importance of physical examination of the abdomen, clinician, and patients alike can benefit. Clin. Anat. 30:352-356, 2017.

The aim of this research was to determine oral health in a representative sample of professional footballers in the UK and investigate possible determinants of oral health and self-reported impact on well-being, training and performance. Clinical oral health examination of senior squad players using standard methods and outcomes carried out at club training facilities. Questionnaire data were also collected. 8 teams were included, 5 Premier League, 2 Championship and 1 League One. 6 dentists examined 187 players who represented >90% of each senior squad. Oral health was poor: 37% players had active dental caries, 53% dental erosion and 5% moderate-severe irreversible periodontal disease. 45% were bothered by their oral health, 20% reported an impact on their quality of life and 7% on training or performance. Despite attendance for dental check-ups, oral health deteriorated with age. This is the first large, representative sample study in professional football. Oral health of professional footballers is poor, and this impacts on well-being and performance. Successful strategies to promote oral health within professional football are urgently needed, and research should investigate models based on best evidence for behaviour change and implementation science. Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence to support oral health screening within professional football. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was performed in an academic surgical residency program in a tertiary care hospital, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio. The participants were 140 surgical postgraduate year 1 residents from 2000 to 2009. Interns from 2000 to 2004 were grouped together and completed a self-directed learning curriculum. Interns from 2005 to 2009 participated in a structured educational curriculum that included lectures and the use of an online program. Lectures were based on the American College of Surgeons curriculum. The online program consisted of 8 to 12 hours of assigned tutorials and quizzes that corresponded to the lectures and 3 multiple-choice (MC) examinations. Use of a structured educational curriculum led to improved ABSITE scores (66 Â± 9%) compared with that of those who had no curriculum (55 Â± 10%, p < 0.001). Several variables positively correlated with the ABSITE score: United States Medical Licensing Examination step 1 score (p < 0.001), monthly quiz scores (p = 0.003), average MC examination scores (p = 0.005), lecture attendance (p = 0.02), and time spent online (p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the step 1 United States Medical Licensing Examination score, time spent online, and MC examination score are predictive of total the ABSITE score. When ABSITE subscores (basic science and clinical science) were compared, the online curriculum had a greater effect on basic science subscores, whereas lectures had a greater effect on clinical science subscores. Providing surgery residents a structured curriculum with lectures and an online component positively impacts ABSITE scores. Copyright Â© 2015 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Although there have been many studies on the reliability of both screening techniques, there is still controversy in the screening strategies; clinical vs. selective or universal ultrasound screening. To determine the screening strategy, we assessed the agreement among the methods; clinical examination by an experienced pediatric orthopedic surgeon, sonographic morphology, and sonographic stability. From January 2004 to June 2009, a single experienced pediatric orthopedic surgeon performed clinical hip screenings for 2,686 infants in the neonatal unit and 43 infants who were referred due to impressions of hip dysplasia before 3 months of age. Among them, 156 clinically unstable or high-risk babies selectively received bilateral hip ultrasound examinations performed by the same surgeon using the modified Graf method. The results were analyzed statistically to detect any correlations between the clinical and sonographic findings. Although a single experienced orthopedic surgeon conducted all examinations, we detected only a limited relationship between the results of clinical and ultrasound examinations. Ninety-three percent of the clinically subluxatable hips were normal or immature based on static ultrasound examination, and 74% of dislocating hips and 67% of limited abduction hips presented with the morphology below Graf IIa. A total of 80% of clinically subluxatable, 42% of dislocating and 67% of limited abduction hips appeared stable or exhibited minor instability on dynamic ultrasound examination. About 7% of clinically normal hips were abnormal upon ultrasound examination; 5% showed major instability and 3% showed dysplasia above Graf IIc. Clinical stability had small coefficients between ultrasound examinations; 0.39 for sonographic stability and 0.37 for sonographic morphology. Between sonographic\n\nImportant clinical descriptors to include in the examination and assessment of patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome: an international and multi-disciplinary Delphi survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nReiman, M P; Thorborg, K; Covington, K; Cook, C E; HÃ¶lmich, P\n\n2017-06-01\n\nDetermine which examination findings are key clinical descriptors of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) through use of an international, multi-disciplinary expert panel. A three-round Delphi survey utilizing an international, multi-disciplinary expert panel operationally defined from international publications and presentations was utilized. All six domains (subjective examination, patient-reported outcome measures, physical examination, special tests, physical performance measures, and diagnostic imaging) had at least one descriptor with 75% consensus agreement for diagnosis and assessment of FAIS. Diagnostic imaging was the domain with the highest level of agreement. Domains such as patient-reported outcome measures (PRO's) and physical examination were identified as non-diagnostic measures (rather as assessments of disease impact). Although it also had the greatest level of variability in description of examination domains, diagnostic imaging continues to be the preeminent diagnostic measure for FAIS. No single domain should be utilized as the sole diagnostic or assessment parameter for FAIS. While not all investigated domains provide diagnostic capability for FAIS, those that do not are able to serve purpose as a measure of disease impact (e.g., impairments and activity limitations). The clinical relevance of this Delphi survey is the understanding that a comprehensive assessment measuring both diagnostic capability and disease impact most accurately reflects the patient with FAIS. V.\n\nThe rational clinical examination. Does this patient have strep throat?\n\nPubMed\n\nEbell, M H; Smith, M A; Barry, H C; Ives, K; Carey, M\n\n2000-12-13\n\nSore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence. To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat. MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination. Large blinded, prospective studies (having > or =300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies. The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations. While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.\n\nDoes Changing Examiner Stations During UK Postgraduate Surgery Objective Structured Clinical Examinations Influence Examination Reliability and Candidates' Scores?\n\nPubMed\n\nBrennan, Peter A; Croke, David T; Reed, Malcolm; Smith, Lee; Munro, Euan; Foulkes, John; Arnett, Richard\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) are widely used for summative assessment in surgery. Despite standardizing these as much as possible, variation, including examiner scoring, can occur which may affect reliability. In study of a high-stakes UK postgraduate surgical OSCE, we investigated whether examiners changing stations once during a long examining day affected marking, reliability, and overall candidates' scores compared with examiners who examined the same scenario all day. An observational study of 18,262 examiner-candidate interactions from the UK Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons examination was carried at 3 Surgical Colleges across the United Kingdom. Scores between examiners were compared using analysis of variance. Examination reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha, and the comparative distribution of total candidates' scores for each day was evaluated using t-tests of unit-weighted z scores. A significant difference was found in absolute scores differences awarded in the morning and afternoon sessions between examiners who changed stations at lunchtime and those who did not (p < 0.001). No significant differences were found for the main effects of either broad content area (p = 0.290) or station content area (p = 0.450). The reliability of each day was not affected by examiner switching (p = 0.280). Overall, no difference was found in z-score distribution of total candidate scores and categories of examiner switching. This large study has found that although the range of marks awarded varied when examiners change OSCE stations, examination reliability and the likely candidate outcome were not affected. These results may have implications for examination design and examiner experience in surgical OSCEs and beyond. Copyright Â© 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

In this study, we aimed to assess the awareness and use of these examination routines in undergraduate medical teaching in UK medical schools and UK postgraduate clinical practice. Electronic questionnaires were distributed to adult and paediatric musculoskeletal teaching leads at UK medical schools and current UK doctors in training. Responses were received from 67 tutors representing teaching at 22/33 [67Â %] of all UK medical schools, and 70 trainee doctors across a range of postgraduate training specialities. There was widespread adoption, at responding medical schools, of the adult examination routines within musculoskeletal teaching (GALS: 14/16 [88Â %]; REMS: 12/16 [75Â %]) and assessment (GALS: 13/16 [81Â %]; REMS: 12/16 [75Â %]). More trainees were aware of GALS (64/70 [91Â %]) than REMS (14/67 [21Â %]). Of the 39 trainees who used GALS in their clinical practice, 35/39 [90Â %] reported that it had improved their confidence in musculoskeletal examination. Of the 17/22 responding medical schools that included paediatric musculoskeletal examination within their curricula, 15/17 [88Â %] used the pGALS approach and this was included within student assessment at 4 medical schools. We demonstrate the widespread adoption of these examination routines in undergraduate education and significant uptake in postgraduate clinical practice. Further study is required to understand their impact upon clinical performance.\n\nSignificance of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations to Plastic Surgery Residency Training.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimmons, Brian J; Zoghbi, Yasmina; Askari, Morad; Birnbach, David J; Shekhter, Ilya; Thaller, Seth R\n\n2017-09-01\n\nObjective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) have proven to be a powerful tool. They possess more than a 30-year track record in assessing the competency of medical students, residents, and fellows. Objective structured clinical examinations have been used successfully in a variety of medical specialties, including surgery. They have recently found their way into the subspecialty of plastic surgery. This article uses a systematic review of the available literature on OSCEs and their recent use in plastic surgery. It incorporates survey results assessing program directors' views on the use of OSCEs. Approximately 40% of programs surveyed use OSCEs to assess the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. We found that 40% use OSCEs to evaluate specific plastic surgery milestones. Objective structured clinical examinations are usually performed annually. They cost anywhere between $100 and more than $1000 per resident. Four milestones giving residents the most difficulties on OSCEs were congenital anomalies, noncancer breast surgery, breast reconstruction, and practice-based learning and improvement. It was determined that challenges with milestones were due to lack of adequate general knowledge and surgical ward patient care, as well as deficits in professionalism and system-based problems. Programs were able to remediate weakness found by OSCEs using a variety of methods. Objective structured clinical examinations offer a unique tool to objectively assess the proficiency of residents in key areas of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. In addition, they can be used to assess the specific milestones that plastic surgery residents must meet. This allows programs to identify and improve identified areas of weakness.\n\nItem Dependency in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nIramaneerat, Cherdsak; Myford, Carol M.; Yudkowsky, Rachel\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAn Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is an assessment approach employed in medical education, in which residents rotate through multiple stations of standardized clinical tasks to evaluate their clinical competence.

Part 1: anatomy, and clinical examination/diagnosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHooper, Troy L; Denton, Jeff; McGalliard, Michael K; BrismÃ©e, Jean-Michel; Sizer, Phillip S\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a frequently overlooked peripheral nerve compression or tension event that creates difficulties for the clinician regarding diagnosis and management. Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.

However, there are contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of such reforms. A study of internal medicine students was carried out using a static group design. The experimental group consisted of 77 students participating in 7 sessions of communication training, 7 sessions of skills-laboratory training and 7 sessions of bedside-teaching, each lasting 1.5 hours. The control group of 66 students from the traditional curriculum participated in equally as many sessions but was offered only bedside teaching. Students' cognitive and practical skills performance was assessed using Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) testing and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), delivered by examiners blind to group membership. The experimental group performed significantly better on the OSCE than did the control group (P < 0.01), whereas the groups did not differ on the MCQ test (P < 0.15). This indicates that specific training in communication and basic clinical skills enabled students to perform better in an OSCE, whereas its effects on knowledge did not differ from those of the traditional curriculum. Curriculum reform promoting communication and basic clinical skills are effective and lead to an improved performance in history taking and physical examination skills.\n\nHybrid Simulation in Teaching Clinical Breast Examination to Medical Students.\n\nPubMed\n\nNassif, Joseph; Sleiman, Abdul-Karim; Nassar, Anwar H; Naamani, Sima; Sharara-Chami, Rana\n\n2017-10-10\n\nClinical breast examination (CBE) is traditionally taught to third-year medical students using a lecture and a tabletop breast model. The opportunity to clinically practice CBE depends on patient availability and willingness to be examined by students, especially in culturally sensitive environments. We propose the use of a hybrid simulation model consisting of a standardized patient (SP) wearing a silicone breast simulator jacket and hypothesize that this, compared to traditional teaching methods, would result in improved learning. Consenting third-year medical students (NÂ =Â 82) at a university-affiliated tertiary care center were cluster-randomized into two groups: hybrid simulation (breast jacket + SP) and control (tabletop breast model). Students received the standard lecture by instructors blinded to the randomization, followed by randomization group-based learning and practice sessions. Two weeks later, participants were assessed in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), which included three stations with SPs blinded to the intervention. The SPs graded the students on CBE completeness, and students completed a self-assessment of their performance and confidence during the examination. CBE completeness scores did not differ between the two groups (pÂ =Â 0.889). Hybrid simulation improved lesion identification grades (pÂ <Â 0.001) without increasing false positives. Hybrid simulation relieved the fear of missing a lesion on CBE (pÂ =Â 0.043) and increased satisfaction with the teaching method among students (pÂ =Â 0.002). As a novel educational tool, hybrid simulation improves the sensitivity of CBE performed by medical students without affecting its specificity. Hybrid simulation may play a role in increasing the confidence of medical students during CBE.\n\nAssociation of the pre-internship objective structured clinical examination in final year medical students with comprehensive written examinations.\n\nPubMed\n\nEftekhar, Hasan; Labaf, Ali; Anvari, Pasha; Jamali, Arsia; Sheybaee-Moghaddam, Farshad\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of the pre-internship Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in final year medical students with comprehensive written examinations. SUBJECTS AND MATERIAL: All medical students of October 2004 admission who took part in the October 2010 National Comprehensive Pre-internship Examination (NCPE) and pre-internship OSCE were included in the study (n = 130). OSCE and NCPE scores and medical grade point average (GPA) were collected. GPA was highly correlated with NCPE (r = 0.76 and P<0.001) and moderately with OSCE (r = 0.68 and P < 0.001). Similarly a moderate correlation was observed between NCPE and OSCE scores(r = 0.6 and P < 0.001).Linear stepwise regression shows r(2) of a model applying GPA as predictor of OSCE score is 0.46 (Î² = 0.68 and P < 0.001), while addition of gender to the model increases r(2) to 0.59 (Î² = 0.61 and 0.36, for GPA and male gender, respectively and P < 0.001). Logistic forward regression models shows male gender and GPA are the only dependent predictors of high score in OSCE. OR of GPA and male gender for high OSCE score are 4.89 (95% CI = 2.37-10.06) and 6.95 (95% CI = 2.00-24.21), respectively (P < 0.001). Our findings indicate OSCE and examination which mainly evaluate knowledge, judged by GPA and NCPE are moderately to highly correlated. Our results illustrate the interwoven nature of knowledge and clinical skills. In other words, certain level of knowledge is crucial for appropriate clinical performance. Our findings suggest neither OSCE nor written forms of assessments can replace each other. They are complimentary and should also be combined by other evaluations to cover all attributes of clinical competence efficiently.\n\nAssociation of the pre-internship objective structured clinical examination in final year medical students with comprehensive written examinations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEftekhar, Hasan; Labaf, Ali; Anvari, Pasha; Jamali, Arsia; Sheybaee-Moghaddam, Farshad\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAim The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of the pre-internship Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in final year medical students with comprehensive written examinations.

No clear predictors of symptomatic lumbar zygapophysial joints have yet been demonstrated. To identify significant components of a clinical examination that are associated with symptomatic lumbar discs, zygapophysial joints and SI joints. A prospective, criterion-related concurrent validity study performed at a private radiology practice specializing in spinal diagnostics. The sample consisted of 81 patients with chronic lumbopelvic pain referred for diagnostic injections. Contingency tables were constructed for nine features of the clinical evaluation compared with the results of diagnostic injections. Statistical analysis included chi-squared test for independence, phi and odds ratios with confidence intervals. Patients received blinded clinical examinations by physical therapists, and diagnostic injections were used as the criterion standard. Significant relationships were found between discogenic pain and centralization of pain during repeated movement testing, and pain when rising from sitting. Lumbar zygapophysial joint pain was associated with absence of pain when rising from sitting. Sacroiliac joint pain was related to three or more positive pain provocation tests, pain when rising from sitting, unilateral pain and absence of lumbar pain. Significant correlations exist between clinical examination findings and symptomatic lumbar discs, zygapophysial and SI joints. The strongest relationships were seen between SI joint pain and three or more positive pain provocation tests, centralization of pain for symptomatic discs and absence of pain when rising from sitting for symptomatic lumbar zygapophysial joints.\n\nPrevalence of clinical findings at examinations of young Swedish warmblood riding horses\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Soundness of an individual horse is important for animal welfare and owner economy. However, knowledge of health status in normal horse populations is limited due to lack of systematic health recordings. The aim of the investigation was to study the prevalence of veterinary clinical findings in 4-5-year-old Swedish warmblood riding horses, and their influence on overall health scores, where associations to future longevity has been indicated. Results The prevalence of clinical findings in 8,281 horses examined during 1983â2005 was studied according to a standardised protocol and related to overall health scores in linear statistical models. Effects of sex, age, examination event and changes over time were included. In total, 49% of the horses had clinical findings of medical health (MED), 42% in hooves (HOOF) and 74% of palpatory orthopaedic health (PALP). However, only 6%, 3% and 24% had moderate or severe findings, of MED, HOOF and PALP, respectively. Flexion test reactions were reported in 21% of the horses (5% moderate/severe), heavily influencing the overall score (H2). One fifth of these horses also had findings of unprovoked lameness while 83% had PALP findings (44% with moderate/severe findings). Acute clinical signs, i.e. heat or soreness, had a large influence on the H2 score but were rare, whereas more common clinical findings had smaller effects on overall health. Large variations in recorded health results were observed among events. A decrease in findings has occurred since 1983, in particular for PALP findings. Conclusions Results of occurrence and relevance of evaluated clinical findings could be used for advice on preventive actions to keep horses sound, and possibly for benchmarking, and genetic evaluation of health traits. The distinct effect of event on recorded clinical findings emphasises that further harmonisation of veterinary examinations are desirable.

Although mammographic screening without clinical breast examination has not been recommended, its introduction is anticipated. The efficacies of mammographic screening with and without clinical breast examination were evaluated based on the results of randomized controlled trials. PubMed and other databases for studies published between 1985 and 2014 were searched. The study design was limited to randomized controlled trials to evaluate mortality reduction from breast cancer. Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis of mammographic screening without clinical breast examination. The relative risk for women aged 40â74Â years was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.67â0.83). Three studies evaluated the efficacy of mammographic screening with clinical breast examination. The relative risk for women aged 40â64Â years was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.77â0.98). The number needed to invite was always lower in mammographic screening without clinical breast examinationÂ than in mammographic screening with clinical breast examination. In bothÂ screening methods, the number needed to invite was higher in women aged 40â49Â years than in women aged 50â70Â years. These results suggest that mammographic screening without clinical breast examination can afford higher benefits to women aged 50Â years and over. Although evidence of the efficacy of mammographic screening without clinical breast examination was confirmed based on the results of the randomized controlled trials, a Japanese study is needed to resolve local problems.

Thus, we investigated which factors in a surgery clerkship curriculum have a positive effect on academic achievement on the National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in Surgery. A retrospective analysis of 83 third-year medical students at our institution with 4 unique clinical experiences on the general surgery clerkship for the 2007-2008 academic year was conducted. Records of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores, National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in Surgery scores, and essay examination scores for the groups were compared using 1-way analysis of variance testing. Rush University Medical Center, Chicago IL, an academic institution and tertiary care center. Our data demonstrated National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in Surgery scores from the group with the heavier clinical loads and least time for self-study were statistically higher than the group with lighter clinical services and higher rated self-study time (p = 0.036). However, there was no statistical difference of National Board of Medical Examiners Subject Examination in Surgery scores between the groups with equal clinical loads (p = 0.751). Students experiencing higher clinical volumes on surgical services, but less self-study time demonstrated statistically higher academic performance on objective evaluation, suggesting clinical experience may be of higher value than self-study and reading.

Does this infant have pneumonia?\n\nPubMed\n\nMargolis, P; Gadomski, A\n\n1998-01-28\n\nAcute lower respiratory tract illness is common among children seen in primary care. We reviewed the accuracy and precision of the clinical examination in detecting pneumonia in children. Although most cases are viral, it is important to identify bacterial pneumonia to provide appropriate therapy. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE from 1982 to 1995, reviewing reference lists, reviewing a published compendium of studies of the clinical examination, and consulting experts. Observer agreement is good for most signs on the clinical examination. Each study was reviewed by 2 observers and graded for methodologic quality. There is better agreement about signs that can be observed (eg, use of accessory muscles, color, attentiveness; kappa, 0.48-0.66) than signs that require auscultation of the chest (eg, adventitious sounds; kappa, 0.3). Measurements of the respiratory rate are enhanced by counting for 60 seconds. The best individual finding for ruling out pneumonia is the absence of tachypnea. Chest indrawing, and other signs of increased work of breathing, increases the likelihood of pneumonia. If all clinical signs (respiratory rate, auscultation, and work of breathing) are negative, the chest x-ray findings are unlikely to be positive. Studies are needed to assess the value of clinical findings when they are used together.\n\nThe Associations Between Clerkship Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) Grades and Subsequent Performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nDong, Ting; Zahn, Christopher; Saguil, Aaron; Swygert, Kimberly A; Yoon, Michelle; Servey, Jessica; Durning, Steven\n\n2017-01-01\n\nConstruct: We investigated the extent of the associations between medical students' clinical competency measured by performance in Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) during Obstetrics/Gynecology and Family Medicine clerkships and later performance in both undergraduate and graduate medical education. There is a relative dearth of studies on the correlations between undergraduate OSCE scores and future exam performance within either undergraduate or graduate medical education and almost none on linking these simulated encounters to eventual patient care. Of the research studies that do correlate clerkship OSCE scores with future performance, these often have a small sample size and/or include only 1 clerkship. Students in USU graduating classes of 2007 through 2011 participated in the study. We investigated correlations between clerkship OSCE grades with United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Knowledge, Clinical Skills, and Step 3 Exams scores as well as Postgraduate Year 1 program director's evaluation scores on Medical Expertise and Professionalism. We also conducted contingency table analysis to examine the associations between poor performance on clerkship OSCEs with failing Step 3 and receiving poor program director ratings. The correlation coefficients were weak between the clerkship OSCE grades and the outcomes. The strongest correlations existed between the clerkship OSCE grades and the Step 2 CS Integrated Clinical Encounter component score, Step 2 Clinical Skills, and Step 3 scores. Contingency table associations between poor performances on both clerkships OSCEs and poor Postgraduate Year 1 Program Director ratings were significant. The results of this study provide additional but limited validity evidence for the use of OSCEs during clinical clerkships given their associations with subsequent performance measures.\n\nBell palsy: Clinical examination and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Donika K; Levin, Kerry H\n\n2015-07-01\n\nBell palsy is a common neurologic disorder characterized by acute facial mononeuropathy of unclear cause presenting with unilateral facial weakness. Careful examination and a detailed history are important in making an accurate diagnosis. Early recognition is essential, as treatment with corticosteroids within 72 hours of onset has been shown to hasten recovery.

Methods: Data include assessments from a multistation OSCE taken by 194 medical students at the completion of a neurology clerkship. Facets evaluated in this study include cases, domains, and items. Domains refer to areas of skill (or constructs) that the OSCE measures. G theory is used to estimate variance components associated with each facet, derive reliability, and project the number of cases required to obtain a reliable (consistent, precise) score. Results: Reliability using G theory is moderate (Î¦ coefficient = 0.61, G coefficient = 0.64). Performance is similar across cases but differs by the particular domain, such that the majority of variance is attributed to the domain. Projections in reliability estimates reveal that students need to participate in 3 OSCE cases in order to increase reliability beyond the 0.70 threshold. Conclusions: This novel use of G theory in evaluating an OSCE in neurology provides meaningful measurement characteristics of the assessment. Differing from prior work in other medical specialties, the cases students were randomly assigned did not influence their OSCE score; rather, scores varied in expected fashion by domain assessed.

Japan is the world's third largest drug market with a unique health care system, making it a key inclusion as an operational region for MRCT (MRCT-JP) for global drug development. We aimed to identify the factors required for efficient drug development by comprehensively reviewing the clinical trials of drugs approved in Japan to identify the factors associated with whether or not MRCT-JP is implemented. We surveyed the review reports and summaries of application data published by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. We identified drugs for which the clinical trial data package included MRCT-JP and selected the same number of drugs for which the clinical trial data package did not include MRCT-JP from the most recent survey period for comparison. We also examined other publication information, in addition to the review reports, as necessary. The influence of each explanatory variable was analyzed by logistic regression analysis, with whether or not MRCT-JP was implemented as the explanatory variable. Statistical significance was set at 5%. In the survey period up to September 2017, 165 drugs developed with MRCT-JP were approved for manufacture and sale in Japan. \"Respiratory system,\" \"inhalation,\" \"biological drug,\" and \"under review\" evaluation status for the United States, European Union, and other areas, \"approved\" evaluation status for the United States, \"new ingredients,\" \"priority review,\" \"non-Japanese firm,\" and \"Top 1-10\" and \"Top 11-20\" drug sales rankings for pharmaceutical companies were identified as potential factors leading to the implementation of MRCT-JP. In contrast, \"general anti-infectives for systemic use,\" \"various,\" \"external,\" \"chemical compound,\" \"unsubmitted\" evaluation status for both the United States and European Union, and \"Top 51+\" drug sales rankings were potential factors for\n\nPredictors of clinical outcome following lumbar disc surgery: the value of historical, physical examination, and muscle function variables.\n\nPubMed\n\nHebert, Jeffrey J; Fritz, Julie M; Koppenhaver, Shane L; Thackeray, Anne; Kjaer, Per\n\n2016-01-01\n\nExplore the relationships between preoperative findings and clinical outcome following lumbar disc surgery, and investigate the prognostic value of physical examination findings after accounting for information acquired from the clinical history. We recruited 55 adult patients scheduled for first time, single-level lumbar discectomy. Participants underwent a standardized preoperative evaluation including real-time ultrasound imaging assessment of lumbar multifidus function, and an 8-week postoperative rehabilitation programme. Clinical outcome was defined by change in disability, and leg and low back pain (LBP) intensity at 10 weeks. Linear regression models were used to identify univariate and multivariate predictors of outcome. Univariate predictors of better outcome varied depending on the outcome measure. Clinical history predictors included a greater proportion of leg pain to LBP, pain medication use, greater time to surgery, and no history of previous physical or injection therapy. Physical examination predictors were a positive straight or cross straight leg raise test, diminished lower extremity strength, sensation or reflexes, and the presence of postural abnormality or pain peripheralization. Preoperative pain peripheralization remained a significant predictor of improved disability (p = 0.04) and LBP (p = 0.02) after accounting for information from the clinical history. Preoperative lumbar multifidus function was not associated with clinical outcome. Information gleaned from the clinical history and physical examination helps to identify patients more likely to succeed with lumbar disc surgery. While this study helps to inform clinical practice, additional research confirming these results is required prior to confident clinical implementation.\n\nQuality of referral: What information should be included in a request for diagnostic imaging when a patient is referred to a clinical radiologist?\n\nPubMed\n\nG Pitman, Alexander\n\n2017-06-01\n\nReferral to a clinical radiologist is the prime means of communication between the referrer and the radiologist. Current Australian and New Zealand government regulations do not prescribe what clinical information should be included in a referral. This work presents a qualitative compilation of clinical radiologist opinion, relevant professional recommendations, governmental regulatory positions and prior work on diagnostic error to synthesise recommendations on what clinical information should be included in a referral. Recommended requirements on what clinical information should be included in a referral to a clinical radiologist are as follows: an unambiguous referral; identity of the patient; identity of the referrer; and sufficient clinical detail to justify performance of the diagnostic imaging examination and to confirm appropriate choice of the examination and modality. Recommended guideline on the content of clinical detail clarifies when the information provided in a referral meets these requirements. High-quality information provided in a referral allows the clinical radiologist to ensure that exposure of patients to medical radiation is justified. It also minimises the incidence of perceptual and interpretational diagnostic error. Recommended requirements and guideline on the clinical detail to be provided in a referral to a clinical radiologist have been formulated for professional debate and adoption.

(MSE)\n\nThe relationship between medical students' epistemological beliefs and achievement on a clinical performance examination.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Sun-A; Chung, Eun-Kyung; Han, Eui-Ryoung; Woo, Young-Jong; Kevin, Deiter\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThis study was to explore the relationship between clinical performance examination (CPX) achievement and epistemological beliefs to investigate the potentials of epistemological beliefs in ill-structured medical problem solving tasks. We administered the epistemological beliefs questionnaire (EBQ) to fourth-year medical students and correlated the results with their CPX scores. The EBQ comprised 61 items reflecting five belief systems: certainty of knowledge, source of knowledge, rigidity of learning, ability to learn, and speed of knowledge acquisition. The CPX included scores for history taking, physical examination, and patient-physician interaction. The higher epistemological beliefs group obtained significantly higher scores on the CPX with regard to history taking and patient-physician interaction. The epistemological beliefs scores on certainty of knowledge and source of knowledge were significantly positively correlated with patient-physician interaction. The epistemological beliefs scores for ability to learn were significantly positively correlated with those for history taking, physical examination, and patient-physician interaction. Students with more sophisticated and advanced epistemological beliefs stances used more comprehensive and varied approaches in the patient-physician interaction. Therefore, educational efforts that encourage discussions pertaining to epistemological views should be considered to improve clinical reasoning and problem-solving competence in the clinic setting.\n\n42 CFR 21.41 - Professional examinations, holding of; subjects to be included.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Professional examinations, holding of; subjects to be included. 21.41 Section 21.41 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PERSONNEL COMMISSIONED OFFICERS Appointment Â§ 21.41 Professional examinations, holding of...\n\nDo Clinical Clerks Provide Candidates with Adequate Formative Assessment during Objective Structured Clinical Examinations?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nReiter, Harold I.; Rosenfeld, Jack; Nandagopal, Kiruthiga; Eva, Kevin W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nContext: Various research studies have examined the question of whether expert or non-expert raters, faculty or students, evaluators or standardized patients, give more reliable and valid summative assessments of performance on Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Less studied has been the question of whether or not non-facultyâ¦\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Dysfunction: Concordance of Clinical Findings, Doppler Ultrasound Examination, and Shunt Venography.\n\nPubMed\n\nOwen, Joshua M; Gaba, Ron Charles\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the concordance between clinical symptoms, Doppler ultrasound (US), and shunt venography for the detection of stent-graft transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction. Forty-one patients (M:F 30:11, median age 55 years) who underwent contemporaneous clinical exam, Doppler US, and TIPS venography between 2003 and 2014 were retrospectively studied. Clinical symptoms (recurrent ascites or variceal bleeding) were dichotomously classified as present/absent, and US and TIPS venograms were categorized in a binary fashion as normal/abnormal. US abnormalities included high/low (>190 or <90 cm/s) TIPS velocity, significant velocity rise/fall (>50 cm/s), absent flow, and return of antegrade intra-hepatic portal flow. Venographic abnormalities included shunt stenosis/occlusion and/or pressure gradient elevation. Clinical and imaging concordance rates were calculated. Fifty-two corresponding US examinations and venograms were assessed. The median time between studies was 3 days. Forty of 52 (77%) patients were symptomatic, 33/52 (64%) US examinations were abnormal, and 20/52 (38%) TIPS venograms were abnormal. Concordance between clinical symptoms and TIPS venography was 48% (25/52), while the agreement between US and shunt venography was 65% (34/52). Clinical symptoms and the US concurred in 60% (31/52) of the patients. The sensitivity of clinical symptoms and US for the detection of venographically abnormal shunts was 80% (16/20) and 85% (17/20), respectively. Both clinical symptoms and the US had low specificity (25%, 8/32 and 50%, 16/32) for venographically abnormal shunts. Clinical findings and the US had low concordance rates with TIPS venography, with acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity. These findings suggest the need for improved noninvasive imaging methods for stent-graft TIPS surveillance.\n\nTransjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Dysfunction: Concordance of Clinical Findings, Doppler Ultrasound Examination, and Shunt Venography\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOwen, Joshua M; Gaba, Ron Charles\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the concordance between clinical symptoms, Doppler ultrasound (US), and shunt venography for the detection of stent-graft transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction.

The series is taken from the Faculty of General Dental Practice UK (FGDP[UK]) 2016 Good Practice Guidelines book on this topic, edited by A. M. Hadden. This particular article discusses history taking, where information may be gathered prior to the patient seeing the clinician or, in some cases, this may be carried out chairside by the individual. The information gathered can include a medical history, socio-behavioural history, and patient anxiety levels. It is important to note that throughout this article (and the BDJ series and associated FGDP[UK] book), the specific guidelines will be marked as follows: A: Aspirational, B: Basic, C: Conditional. Further information about this guideline notation system is provided in Part 1 of this series ( 2017; 223: 765-768).\n\nSignificance of clinical examination, CT and MRI scan in the diagnosis of posterior pelvic ring fractures.\n\nPubMed\n\nNÃ¼chtern, J V; Hartel, M J; Henes, F O; Groth, M; Jauch, S Y; Haegele, J; Briem, D; Hoffmann, M; Lehmann, W; Rueger, J M; GroÃterlinden, L G\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPatients with a fracture in the anterior pelvic ring often simultaneously demonstrate pain in the posterior pelvic ring. The aim of the present prospective study was to assess the sensitivity of CT, MRI and clinical examination in the detection of fractures in the posterior pelvic ring in patients with fractures of the anterior pelvic ring diagnosed in conventional radiographs. Sixty patients with radiographic signs of an anterior pelvic ring injury were included in this prospective analysis. Following a focused clinical examination of the posterior pelvis, all patients underwent both a CT and then a MRI scan of their pelvis. Two board certified radiologists evaluated the CT and MRI scans independently. To estimate the presence of osteoporosis the Hounsfield units of the vertebral body of L5 were measured in each case. Fifty-three women and seven men, with a mean age of 74.7+/-15.6 years were included into the study. A fracture of the posterior pelvic ring was found in fourty-eight patients (80%) patients using MRI. Fractures of the posterior pelvic ring would have been missed in eight cases (17%), if only CT had been used. Eighty-five percent of the patients with a posterior fracture had an osteoporosis. The majority of the cases suffered from a low energy trauma. Thirty-eight patients (83%) with positive clinical signs at the posterior pelvic ring actually had a fracture of the posterior pelvic ring in the MRI. The clinical examination proved to be equally effective to CT in detecting posterior pelvic ring fractures. The significance of both, clinical examination and CT was confirmed in the detection of fractures in the posterior pelvic ring. MRI examination of the pelvis however, was found to be superior in detecting undislocated fractures in a cohort of patients with a high incidence of osteoporosis. Using MRI may be beneficial in select cases, especially when reduced bone density is suspected. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known regarding clinical technique and how it relates to diagnostic accuracy. We sought to quantify breast examination search patterns and hand utilization with a new data collection and analysis system. Participants performed the CBE while the sensor mapping and video camera system collected performance data. From this data, algorithms were developed that measured the number of hands used during the exam and active examination time. This system is a feasible and reliable method to collect new information on CBE techniques.\n\nSpecial Physical Examination Tests for Superior Labrum Anterior-Posterior Shoulder Tears: An Examination of Clinical Usefulness\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSandrey, Michelle A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nReference/Citation: Calvert E, Chambers GK, Regan W, Hawkins RH, Leith JM. Special physical examination tests for superior labrum anterior-posterior shoulder injuries are clinically limited and invalid: a diagnostic systematic review. J Clin Epidemiol. 2009;62(5):558â563. Clinical Question: The systematic review focused on diagnostic accuracy studies to determine if evidence was sufficient to support the use of superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) physical examination tests as valid and reliable. The primary question was whether there was sufficient evidence in the published literature to support the use of SLAP physical examination tests as valid and reliable diagnostic test procedures. Data Sources: Studies published in English were identified through database searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database (1970â2004) using the search term SLAP lesions. The medical subject headings of arthroscopy, shoulder joint, and athletic injuries were combined with test or testing, physical examination, and sensitivity and specificity to locate additional sources. Other sources were identified by rereviewing the reference lists of included studies and review articles. Study Selection: Studies were eligible based on the following criteria: (1) published in English, (2) focused on the physical examination of SLAP lesions, and (3) presented original data. A study was excluded if the article was limited to a clinical description of 1 or more special tests without any research focus to provide clinical accuracy data or if it did not focus on the topic. Data Extraction: The abstracts that were located through the search strategies were reviewed, and potentially relevant abstracts were selected. Strict epidemiologic methods were used to obtain and collate all relevant studies; the authors developed a study questionnaire to record study name, year of publication, study design, sample size, and statistics. Validity of the diagnostic test study was determined by\n\nSpecial physical examination tests for superior labrum anterior-posterior shoulder tears: an examination of clinical usefulness.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandrey, Michelle A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCalvert E, Chambers GK, Regan W, Hawkins RH, Leith JM.

Knowledge of clinical history has also been shown to enhance the more complex cognitive task of physical examination diagnosis, possibly by enabling early hypothesis generation. However, it is unclear whether clinicians adhere to these early hypotheses in the face of unexpected physical findings, thus resulting in diagnostic error. A sample of 180 internal medicine residents received a short clinical history and conducted a cardiac physical examination on a high-fidelity simulator. Resident Doctors (Residents) were randomised to three groups based on the physical findings in the simulator. The concordant group received physical examination findings consistent with the diagnosis that was most probable based on the clinical history. Discordant groups received findings associated with plausible alternative diagnoses which either lacked expected findings (indistinct discordant) or contained unexpected findings (distinct discordant). Physical examination diagnostic accuracy and physical examination findings were analysed. Physical examination diagnostic accuracy varied significantly among groups (75âÂ±â44%, 2âÂ±â13% and 31âÂ±â47% in the concordant, indistinct discordant and distinct discordant groups, respectively (F(2,177) â=â53, pâ<â0.0001). Of the 115 Residents who were diagnostically unsuccessful, 33% adhered to their original incorrect hypotheses. Residents verbalised an average of 12 findings (interquartile range: 10-14); 58âÂ±â17% were correct and the percentage of correct findings was similar in all three groups (pâ=â0.44). Residents showed substantially decreased diagnostic accuracy when faced with discordant physical findings. The majority of trainees given discordant physical findings rejected their initial hypotheses, but were still diagnostically unsuccessful.

This study was undertaken to compare the clinical evaluation of 15 patients who suffered inversion injuries of the ankle with the results found on magnetic resonance imaging within 48 hours of the injury. Physical examination was found to be 100% accurate in the diagnosis of grade III ligament injuries but only 25% accurate in the diagnosis of grade II injuries. Clinicians most often underestimate the damage with a grade II ligament tear. Furthermore, other associated injuries, such as significant capsule ruptures and tendon damage, were often overlooked at physical examination.\n\nThe reliability of the clinical examination in predicting hemodynamic status in acute febrile illness in a tropical, resource-limited setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoek, Felix; Poe, Poe; Charunwatthana, Prakaykaew; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Wattanagoon, Yupaporn; Chierakul, Wirongrong\n\n2018-05-19\n\nThe clinical examination alone is widely considered unreliable when assessing fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Little evidence exists on the performance of the clinical examination to predict other hemodynamic derangements or more complex hemodynamic states. Patients with acute febrile illness were assessed on admission, both clinically and per non-invasive hemodynamic measurement. Correlations between clinical signs and hemodynamics patterns were analyzed, and the predictive capacity of the clinical signs was examined. Seventy-one patients were included; the most common diagnoses were bacterial sepsis, scrub typhus and dengue infection. Correlations between clinical signs and hemodynamic parameters were only statistically significant for Cardiac Index (r=0.75, p-value <0.01), Systemic Vascular Resistance Index (r=0.79, p-value <0.01) and flow time corrected (r=0.44, p-value 0.03). When assessing the predictive accuracy of clinical signs, the model identified only 62% of hemodynamic states correctly, even less if there was more than one hemodynamic abnormality. The clinical examination is not reliable to assess a patient's hemodynamic status in acute febrile illness. Fluid responsiveness, cardiodepression and more complex hemodynamic states are particularly easily missed.\n\nPortfolio of prospective clinical trials including brachytherapy: an analysis of the ClinicalTrials.gov database.\n\nPubMed\n\nCihoric, Nikola; Tsikkinis, Alexandros; Miguelez, Cristina Gutierrez; Strnad, Vratislav; Soldatovic, Ivan; Ghadjar, Pirus; Jeremic, Branislav; Dal Pra, Alan; Aebersold, Daniel M; LÃ¶ssl, Kristina\n\n2016-03-22\n\nTo evaluate the current status of prospective interventional clinical trials that includes brachytherapy (BT) procedures. The records of 175,538 (100 %) clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov were downloaded on September 2014 and a database was established. Trials using BT as an intervention were identified for further analyses. The selected trials were manually categorized according to indication(s), BT source, applied dose rate, primary sponsor type, location, protocol initiator and funding source. We analyzed trials across 8 available trial protocol elements registered within the database. In total 245 clinical trials were identified, 147 with BT as primary investigated treatment modality and 98 that included BT as an optional treatment component or as part of the standard treatment. Academic centers were the most frequent protocol initiators in trials where BT was the primary investigational treatment modality (p < 0.01). High dose rate (HDR) BT was the most frequently investigated type of BT dose rate (46.3 %) followed by low dose rate (LDR) (42.0 %). Prostate was the most frequently investigated tumor entity in trials with BT as the primary treatment modality (40.1 %) followed by breast cancer (17.0 %). BT was rarely the primary investigated treatment modality for cervical cancer (6.8 %). Most clinical trials using BT are predominantly in early phases, investigator-initiated and with low accrual numbers. Current investigational activities that include BT mainly focus on prostate and breast cancers. Important questions concerning the optimal usage of BT will not be answered in the near future.\n\nThe Skin Cancer Objective Structured Clinical Examination (SCOSCE): A multi-institutional collaboration to develop and validate a clinical skills assessment for melanoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarg, Amit; Biello, Katie; Hoot, Joyce W; Reddy, Shalini B; Wilson, Lindsay; George, Paul; Robinson-Bostom, Leslie; Belazarian, Leah; Domingues, Erik; Powers, Jennifer; Jacob, Reza; Powers, Michael; Besen, Justin; Geller, Alan C\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAssessing medical students on core skills related to melanoma detection is challenging in the absence of a well-developed instrument. We sought to develop an objective structured clinical examination for the detection and evaluation of melanoma among medical students. This was a prospective cohort analysis of student and objective rater agreement on performance of clinical skills and assessment of differences in performance across 3 schools. Kappa coefficients indicated excellent agreement for 3 of 5 core skills including commenting on the presence of the moulage (k = 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.96), obtaining a history for the moulage (k = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.94), and making a clinical impression (k = 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.92). There were no differences in performance across schools with respect to 3 of 5 core skills: commenting on the presence of the moulage (P = .15), initiating a history (P = .53), and managing the suspicious lesion (P value range .07-.17). Overall, 54.2% and 44.7% of students commented on the presence of the moulage and achieved maximum performance of core skills, respectively, with no difference in performance across schools. Limitations include overall sample size of students and schools. The Skin Cancer Objective Structured Clinical Examination represents a potentially important instrument to measure students' performance on the optimal step-by-step evaluation of a melanoma.

Fixed costs included staff time, medical supplies, facility fee, standardized patient (SP) training time, and one OSCE session. Variable costs were incurred for additional OSCE sessions. Costs per resident were calculated and modeled for increasing the number of test takers. American College of Surgeons OSCE materials and examination facilities were free. Fixed costs included training 11 SPs for 4Â hours ($1,540), moulage and simulation material ($469), and administrative effort for 44Â hours ($2,200). Variable cost for each session was $1,540 (SP time). Total cost for the first session was $6,649 ($664/resident), decreased to $324/resident for 3 sessions, and projected to further decline to $239/resident for 6 sessions. The cost decreased as the number of residents tested increased. To manage costs, testing more trainees by regional collaboration is recommended. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Material and Methods: This paper has a descriptive character and represents a narrative review of the literature and new model implementation. Results: Marketing models are primarily used to improve the inclusion of a larger (and appropriate) number of patients, but they can be credited for the stay and monitoring of patients in the trial. Regulatory mechanisms play an important role in the application of various marketing strategies within clinical trials. The value for the patient as the most important stakeholder is defined in the field of clinical trials according to Kotlerâs value model for the consumer. Conclusion: In order to achieve the best results it is important to adequately examine all the elements of clinical trials and apply this knowledge in creation of a marketing plan that will be made in accordance with the legal regulations defined globally and locally. In this paper, two challenges have been highlighted for the adequate application of marketing tools in the field of clinical trials, namely: defining business elements in order to provide an adequate marketing approach for clinical trials and technology transfer and ensuring uniformity and regulatory affirmation of marketing attitudes in clinical trials in all regions in which they are carried out in accordance with ICH-GCP and valid regulations.
