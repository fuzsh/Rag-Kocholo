        "text": "Analysis of XPS spectra of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions in oxide materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamashita, Toru; Hayes, Peter\n\n2008-02-01\n\nSamples of the iron oxides Fe 0.94O, Fe 3O 4, Fe 2O 3, and Fe 2SiO 4 were prepared by high temperature equilibration in controlled gas atmospheres. The samples were fractured in vacuum and high resolution XPS spectra of the fractured surfaces were measured. The peak positions and peak shape parameters of Fe 3p for Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were derived from the Fe 3p XPS spectra of the standard samples of 2FeOÂ·SiO 2 and Fe 2O 3, respectively. Using these parameters, the Fe 3p peaks of Fe 3O 4 and Fe 1- yO are analysed. The results indicate that high resolution XPS techniques can be used to determine the Fe 2+/Fe 3+ ratios in metal oxides. The technique has the potential for application to other transition metal oxide systems.\n\nA poly-epoxy surface explored by Hartree-Fock ÎSCF simulations of C1s XPS spectra\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGavrielides, A.; Duguet, T., E-mail: thomas.duguet@ensiacet.fr, E-mail: Paul.Bagus@unt.edu; Esvan, J.\n\nWhereas poly-epoxy polymers represent a class of materials with a wide range of applications, the structural disorder makes them difficult to model. In the present work, we use good experimental model samples in the sense that they are pure, fully polymerized, flat and smooth, defect-free, and suitable for ultrahigh vacuum x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS, experiments. In parallel, we perform Hartree-Fock, HF, calculations of the binding energies, BEs, of the C1s electrons in a model molecule composed of the two constituents of the poly-epoxy sample. These C1s BEs were determined using the HF ÎSCF method, which is known to yield accuratemoreÂ Â» values, especially for the shifts of the BEs, ÎBEs. We demonstrate the benefits of combining rigorous theory with careful XPS measurements in order to obtain correct assignments of the C1s XPS spectra of the polymer sample. Both the relative binding energiesâby the ÎSCF methodâand relative intensitiesâin the sudden approximation, SA, are calculated. It results in an excellent match with the experimental spectra. We are able to identify 9 different chemical environments under the C1s peak, where an exclusively experimental work would have found only 3 contributions. In addition, we observe that some contributions are localized at discrete binding energies, whereas others allow a much wider range because of the variation of their second neighbor bound polarization. Therefore, HF-ÎSCF simulations significantly increase the spectral resolution of XPS and thus offer a new avenue for the exploration of the surface of polymers.Â«Â less\n\nXPS Spectra Analysis of Ti2+, Ti3+ Ions and Dye Photodegradation Evaluation of Titania-Silica Mixed Oxide Nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChinh, Vu Duc; Broggi, Alessandra; Di Palma, Luca; Scarsella, Marco; Speranza, Giorgio; Vilardi, Giorgio; Thang, Pham Nam\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides have been prepared by the sol-gel technique from tetrabutyl orthotitanate and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The prepared materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that the TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides have a large surface area and a nanoscale size. FT-IR spectra show that Ti atoms are bonded to silica by oxygen bridging atoms in Ti-O-Si bonds. The titanium valence states in TiO2-SiO2 mixed oxides were investigated by XPS, and their spectra report the presence of Ti2+ and Ti3+ cations for high silica concentration, suggesting the formation of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials has been evaluated for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). The mixed oxides were activated by means of a UV light source, and the concentration of MB was monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The synthesized TiO2-SiO2 shows significantly higher MB removal efficiency in comparison with that of the commercial TiO2 Degussa, P25.\n\nUse of XPS to clarify the Hall coefficient sign variation in thin niobium layers buried in silicon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemchenko, Iraida N.; Lisowski, Wojciech; Syryanyy, Yevgen; Melikhov, Yevgen; Zaytseva, Iryna; Konstantynov, Pavlo; Chernyshova, Maryna; Cieplak, Marta Z.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nSi/Nb/Si trilayers formed with 9.5 and 1.3 nm thick niobium layer buried in amorphous silicon were prepared by magnetron sputtering and studied using XPS depth-profile techniques in order to investigate the change of Hall coefficient sign with thickness. The analysis of high-resolution (HR) XPS spectra revealed that the thicker layer sample has sharp top interface and metallic phase of niobium, thus holes dominate the transport. In contrast, the analysis indicates that the thinner layer sample has a Nb-rich mixed alloy formation at the top interface. The authors suggest that the main effect leading to a change of sign of the Hall coefficient for the thinner layer sample (which is negative contrary to the positive sign for the thicker layer sample) may be related to strong boundary scattering enhanced by the presence of silicon ions in the layer close to the interface/s. The depth-profile reconstruction was performed by SESSA software tool confirming that it can be reliably used for quantitative analysis/interpretation of experimental XPS data.\n\nAcetate- and thiol-capped monodisperse ruthenium nanoparticles: XPS, XAS, and HRTEM studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nChakroune, Nassira; Viau, Guillaume; Ammar, Souad; Poul, Laurence; Veautier, Delphine; Chehimi, Mohamed M; Mangeney, Claire; Villain, FranÃ§oise; FiÃ©vet, Fernand\n\n2005-07-19\n\nMonodisperse ruthenium nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of RuCl3 in 1,2-propanediol. The mean particle size was controlled by appropriate choice of the reduction temperature and the acetate ion concentration. Colloidal solutions in toluene were obtained by coating the metal particles with dodecanethiol. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS for the Ru K-absorption edge) were performed on particles of two different diameters, 2 and 4 nm, and in different environments, polyol/acetate or thiol. For particles stored in polyol/acetate XPS studies revealed superficial oxidation limited to one monolayer and a surface coating containing mostly acetate ions. Analysis of the EXAFS spectra showed both oxygen and ruthenium atoms around the ruthenium atoms with a Ru-Ru coordination number N smaller than the bulk value, as expected for fine particles. In the case of 2 nm acetate-capped particles N is consistent with particles made up of a metallic core and an oxidized monolayer. For 2 nm thiol-coated particles, a Ru-S bond was evidenced by XPS and XAS. For the 4 nm particles XANES and XPS studies showed that most of the ruthenium atoms are in the zerovalent state. Nevertheless, in both cases, when capped with thiol, the Ru-Ru coordination number inferred from EXAFS is much smaller than for particles of the same size stored in polyol. This is attributed to a structural disorganization of the particles by thiol chemisorption. HRTEM studies confirm the marked dependence of the structural properties of the ruthenium particles on their chemical environment; they show the acetate-coated particles to be single crystals, whereas the thiol-coated particles appear to be polycrystalline.\n\nMorphology and Chemical Composition of soot particles emitted by Wood-burning Cook-Stoves: a HRTEM, XPS and Elastic backscattering Studies.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarabali-Sandoval, G. A., Sr.; Castro, T.; Peralta, O.; De la Cruz, W.; DÃ­as, J.; Amelines, O.; Rivera-HernÃ¡ndez, M.; Varela, A.; MuÃ±oz-MuÃ±oz, F.; Policroniades, R.; Murillo, G.; Moreno, E.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe morphology, microstructure and the chemical composition on surface of soot particles were studied by using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elastic backscattering spectrometry. In order to obtain freshly soot particles emitted by home-made wood-burning cook stoves, copper grids for Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) were placed on the last two of an 8-stages MOUDI cascade impactor. The analysis of HRTEM micrographs revealed the nanostructure and the particle size of soot particles. The XPS survey spectra show a large carbon peak around 285 eV and the oxygen signal at 533 eV. Some differences observed in the carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio of the particles probably depend on the combustion process efficiency of each cook-stove analyzed. The C-1s XPS spectra show an asymmetric broad peak and other with low intensity that corresponds to sp2 and sp3hybridization, which were fitted with a convolution using Gaussian functions. Elastic backscattering technique allows a chemical elemental analysis of samples and confirms the presence of C, O and Si observed by XPS. Additionally, the morphological properties of soot aggregates were analyzed calculating the border-based fractal dimension (Df). Particles exhibit complex shapes with high values of Df. Also, real-time absorption (Ïabs) and scattering (Ïsct) coefficients of fine (with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 Âµm) soot particles were measured. The trend in Ïabs and Ïsct indicate that the cooking process has two important combustion stages which varied in its flaming strength, being vigorous in the first stage and soft in the second one.\n\nExtended study on oxidation behaviors of UN0.68 and UN1.66 by XPS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuo, Lizhu; Hu, Yin; Pan, Qifa; Long, Zhong; Lu, Lei; Liu, Kezhao; Wang, Xiaolin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe surface oxidation behaviors of UN0.68 and UN1.66 thin films are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the traditional U4f/N1s, O1s, valence band spectra as well as the unconventional U4d and U5d spectra are collected for the understanding of their oxidation behavior in-depth. Similar asymmetrical peak shape of the U4f spectra to uranium is observed for both uranium nitrides, despite of a slight shift to higher energy side for UN1.66 clean surface. However, significant difference among the corresponding spectra of UN0.68 and UN1.66 during oxidation reveals the distinctive properties of each own. The coexistence of UO2-x, UO2 and UO2-x.Ny on UN0.68 surface results in the peculiar features of U4f spectra as well as the others within the XPS energy scale, where peaks of the oxidized species firstly shift to higher energy side compared to the clean surface, and then return closely towards those of stoichiometric UO2. For UN1.66, the generation of U-N-O ternary compounds on the surface is identified with the symmetrical U4f peaks at 379.9eV and 390.8 eV, which locate intermediate between UO2 and UN1.66, and gradually expanding to higher energy side during the progressive oxidation. Furthermore, the formation of N-O species on UN1.66 surface is also detected as an oxidation product. The metallic character of UN1.66 is identified by the intense signal at Fermi level, which is greatly suppressed by the increasing oxygen exposure and implies the weakening metallic properties of the as-generated U-N-O compounds. Higher uranium oxides, such as UO3 and U4O9, are deduced to be the final oxidation products, and a multistage mechanism for UN1.66 following the exposure to oxygen is discussed.\n\n13C NMR and XPS characterization of anion adsorbent with quaternary ammonium groups prepared from rice straw, corn stalk and sugarcane bagasse\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCao, Wei; Wang, Zhenqian; Zeng, Qingling; Shen, Chunhua\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDespite amino groups modified crop straw has been intensively studied as new and low-cost adsorbent for removal of anionic species from water, there is still a lack of clear characterization for amino groups, especially quaternary ammonium groups in the surface of crop straw. In this study, we used 13C NMR and XPS technologies to characterize adsorbents with quaternary ammonium groups prepared from rice straw, corn stalk and sugarcane bagasse. 13C NMR spectra clearly showed the presence of quaternary ammonium groups in lignocelluloses structure of modified crop straw. The increase of nitrogen observed in XPS survey spectra also indicated the existence of quaternary ammonium group in the surface of the adsorbents. The curve fitting of high-resolution XPS N1s and C1s spectra were conducted to probe the composition of nitrogen and carbon contained groups, respectively. The results showed the proportion of quaternary ammonium group significantly increased in the prepared adsorbent's surface that was dominated by methyl/methylene, hydroxyl, quaternary ammonium, ether and carbonyl groups. This study proved that 13C NMR and XPS could be successfully utilized for characterization of quaternary ammonium modified crop straw adsorbents.\n\nX-PEEM, XPS and ToF-SIMS characterisation of xanthate induced chalcopyrite flotation: Effect of pulp potential\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKalegowda, Yogesh; Chan, Yuet-Loy; Wei, Der-Hsin; Harmer, Sarah L.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nSynchrotron-based X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (X-PEEM), X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy were used to characterize the flotation behaviour of chalcopyrite with xanthate at different processing conditions. The flotation recovery of chalcopyrite decreased from 97% under oxidative conditions (Eh ~ 385 mV SHE, pH 4) to 41% at a reductive potential of - 100 mV SHE (at pH 9). X-PEEM images constructed from the metal L3 absorption edges were used to produce near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra from regions of interest, allowing the variability in mineral surface chemistry of each mineral particle to be analysed, and the effect of pulp potential (Eh) on the flotation of chalcopyrite to be determined. XPS, ToF-SIMS and NEXAFS analyses of chalcopyrite particles at oxidative conditions show that the surface was mildly oxidised and covered with adsorbed molecular CuEX. The Cu 2p XPS and Cu L2,3 NEXAFS spectra were dominated by CuI species attributed to bulk chalcopyrite and adsorbed CuEX. At a reductive potential of - 100 mV SHE, an increase in concentration of CuI and FeIII oxides and hydroxides was observed. X-PEEM analysis was able to show the presence of a low percentage of CuII oxides (CuO or Cu(OH)2) with predominantly CuI oxide (Cu2O) which is not evident in Cu 2p XPS spectra.\n\nEffects of Mn Ion Implantation on XPS Spectroscopy of GaN Thin Films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMajid, Abdul; Ahmad, Naeem; Rizwan, Muhammad; Khan, Salah Ud-Din; Ali, Fekri Abdulraqeb Ahmed; Zhu, Jianjun\n\n2018-02-01\n\nGallium nitride (GaN) thin film was deposited onto a sapphire substrate and then implanted with 250 keV Mn ions at two different doses of 2 Ã 1016 ions/cm2 and 5 Ã 1016 ions/cm2. The as-grown and post-implantation-thermally-annealed samples were studied in detail using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS peaks of Ga 3 d, Ga 2 p, N 1 s, Mn 2 p and C 1 s were recorded in addition to a full survey of the samples. The doublet peaks of Ga 2 p for pure GaN were observed blue-shifted when compared with elemental Ga, and appeared further shifted to higher energies for the implanted samples. These observations point to changes in the bonds and the chemical environment of the host as a result of ion implantation. The results revealed broadening of the N 1 s peak after implantation, which is interpreted in terms of the presence of N-Mn bonds in addition to N-Ga bonds. The XPS spectra of Mn 2 p recorded for ion-implanted samples indicated splitting of Mn 2 p 1/2 and Mn 2 p 3/2 peaks higher than that for metallic Mn, which helps rule out the possibility of clustering and points to substitutional doping of Mn. These observations provide a framework that sheds light on the local environment of the material for understanding the mechanism of magnetic exchange interactions in Mn:GaN based diluted magnetic semiconductors.\n\nComparative study of the native oxide on 316L stainless steel by XPS and ToF-SIMS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTardio, Sabrina, E-mail: s.tardio@surrey.ac.uk; Abel, Marie-Laure; Castle, James E.\n\n2015-09-15\n\nThe very thin native oxide film on stainless steel, of the order of 2ânm, is known to be readily modified by immersion in aqueous media. In this paper, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ions mass spectrometry are employed to investigate the nature of the air-formed film and modification after water emersion. The film is described in terms of oxide, hydroxide, and water content. The preferential dissolution of iron is shown to occur on immersion. It is shown that a water absorbed layer and a hydroxide layer are present above the oxide-like passive film. The concentrations ofmoreÂ Â» water and hydroxide appear to be higher in the case of exposure to water. A secure method for the peak fitting of Fe2p and Cr2p XPS spectra of such films on their metallic substrates is described. The importance of XPS survey spectra is underlined and the feasibility of C{sub 60}{sup +} SIMS depth profiling of a thin oxide layer is shown.Â«Â less\n\nCore-level spectra and binding energies of transition metal nitrides by non-destructive x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy through capping layers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGreczynski, G.; Primetzhofer, D.; Lu, J.; Hultman, L.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe present the first measurements of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) core level binding energies (BE:s) for the widely-applicable group IVb-VIb polycrystalline transition metal nitrides (TMN's) TiN, VN, CrN, ZrN, NbN, MoN, HfN, TaN, and WN as well as AlN and SiN, which are common components in the TMN-based alloy systems. Nitride thin film samples were grown at 400 Â°C by reactive dc magnetron sputtering from elemental targets in Ar/N2 atmosphere. For XPS measurements, layers are either (i) Ar+ ion-etched to remove surface oxides resulting from the air exposure during sample transfer from the growth chamber into the XPS system, or (ii) in situ capped with a few nm thick Cr or W overlayers in the deposition system prior to air-exposure and loading into the XPS instrument. Film elemental composition and phase content is thoroughly characterized with time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-E ERDA), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and x-ray diffraction. High energy resolution core level XPS spectra acquired with monochromatic Al KÎ± radiation on the ISO-calibrated instrument reveal that even mild etching conditions result in the formation of a nitrogen-deficient surface layer that substantially affects the extracted binding energy values. These spectra-modifying effects of Ar+ ion bombardment increase with increasing the metal atom mass due to an increasing nitrogen-to-metal sputter yield ratio. The superior quality of the XPS spectra obtained in a non-destructive way from capped TMN films is evident from that numerous metal peaks, including Ti 2p, V 2p, Zr 3d, and Hf 4f, exhibit pronounced satellite features, in agreement with previously published spectra from layers grown and analyzed in situ. In addition, the N/metal concentration ratios are found to be 25-90% higher than those obtained from the corresponding ion-etched surfaces, and in most cases agree very well with the RBS and ToF-E ERDA values. The N 1 s BE:s extracted from\n\nQuantitative analysis of Ni2+/Ni3+ in Li[NixMnyCoz]O2 cathode materials: Non-linear least-squares fitting of XPS spectra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Zewei; Hu, Juntao; Hu, Wenlong; Yang, Shiyu; Luo, Yunfeng\n\n2018-05-01\n\nQuantitative analysis of Ni2+/Ni3+ using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is important for evaluating the crystal structure and electrochemical performance of Lithium-nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide (Li[NixMnyCoz]O2, NMC). However, quantitative analysis based on Gaussian/Lorentzian (G/L) peak fitting suffers from the challenges of reproducibility and effectiveness. In this study, the Ni2+ and Ni3+ standard samples and a series of NMC samples with different Ni doping levels were synthesized. The Ni2+/Ni3+ ratios in NMC were quantitatively analyzed by non-linear least-squares fitting (NLLSF). Two Ni 2p overall spectra of synthesized Li [Ni0.33Mn0.33Co0.33]O2(NMC111) and bulk LiNiO2 were used as the Ni2+ and Ni3+ reference standards. Compared to G/L peak fitting, the fitting parameters required no adjustment, meaning that the spectral fitting process was free from operator dependence and the reproducibility was improved. Comparison of residual standard deviation (STD) showed that the fitting quality of NLLSF was superior to that of G/L peaks fitting. Overall, these findings confirmed the reproducibility and effectiveness of the NLLSF method in XPS quantitative analysis of Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio in Li[NixMnyCoz]O2 cathode materials.\n\nGold/silver core-shell 20 nm nanoparticles extracted from citrate solution examined by XPS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEngelhard, Mark H.; Smith, Jordan N.; Baer, Donald R.\n\nSilver nanoparticles of many types are widely used in consumer and medical products. The surface chemistry of particles and the coatings that form during synthesis or use in many types of media can significantly impact the behaviors of particles including dissolution, transformation and biological or environmental impact. Consequently it is useful to be able to extract information about the thickness of surface coatings and other attributes of nanoparticles produced in a variety of ways. It has been demonstrated that X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) can be reliably used to determine the thickness of organic and other nanoparticles coatings and shells. However,moreÂ Â» care is required to produce reliable and consistent information. Here we report the XPS spectra from gold/silver core-shell nanoparticles of nominal size 20 nm removed from a citrate saturated solution after one and two washing cycles. The Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA) program had been used to model peak amplitudes to obtain information on citrate coatings that remain after washing and demonstrate the presence of the gold core. This data is provided so that others can compare use of SESSA or other modeling approaches to quantify the nature of coatings to those already published and to explore the impacts particle non-uniformities on XPS signals from core-shell nanoparticles.Â«Â less\n\nThe (001) 3C SiC surface termination and band structure after common wet chemical etching procedures, stated by XPS, LEED, and HREELS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTengeler, Sven; Kaiser, Bernhard; Ferro, Gabriel; Chaussende, Didier; Jaegermann, Wolfram\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe (001) surface of cubic silicon carbide (3C SiC) after cleaning, Ar sputtering and three different wet chemical etching procedures was thoroughly investigated via (angle resolved) XPS, HREELS, and LEED. While Ar sputtering was found to be unsuitable for surface preparation, all three employed wet chemical etching procedures (piranha/NH4F, piranha/HF, and RCA) provide a clean surface. HF as oxide removal agent tends to result in fluorine traces on the sample surface, despite thorough rinsing. All procedures yield a 1 Ã 1 Si-OH/C-H terminated surface. However, the XPS spectra reveal some differences in the resulting surface states. NH4F for oxide removal produces a flat band situation, whereas the other two procedures result in a slight downward (HF) or upward (RCA) band bending. Because the band bending is small, it can be concluded that the number of unsaturated surface defects is low.\n\nRECENT XPS STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON NB SRF SURFACES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHui Tian; Binping Xiao; Michael Kelley\n\nXPS studies have consistently shown that Nb surfaces for SRF chiefly comprise of a few nm of Nb2O5 on top of Nb metal, with minor amounts of Nb sub-oxides. Nb samples after BCP/EP treatment with post-baking at the various conditions have been examined by using synchrotron based XPS. Despite the confounding influence of surface roughness, certain outcomes are clear. Lower-valence Nb species are always and only associated with the metal/oxide interface, but evidence for an explicit layer structure or discrete phases is lacking. Post-baking without air exposure shows decreased oxide layer thickness and increased contribution from lower valence species, butmoreÂ Â» spectra obtained after subsequent air exposure cannot be distinguished from those obtained prior to baking, though the SRF performance improvement remains.Â«Â less\n\nXPS and bioactivity study of the bisphosphonate pamidronate adsorbed onto plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coatings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcLeod, Kate; Kumar, Sunil; Smart, Roger St. C.; Dutta, Naba; Voelcker, Nicolas H.; Anderson, Gail I.; Sekel, Ron\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThis paper reports the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate bisphosphonate (BP) adsorption onto plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings commonly used for orthopaedic implants. BPs exhibit high binding affinity for the calcium present in HA and hence can be adsorbed onto HA-coated implants to exploit their beneficial properties for improved bone growth at the implant interface. A rigorous XPS analysis of pamidronate, a commonly used nitrogenous BP, adsorbed onto plasma sprayed HA-coated cobalt-chromium substrates has been carried out, aimed at: (a) confirming the adsorption of this BP onto HA; (b) studying the BP diffusion profile in the HA coating by employing the technique of XPS depth profiling; (c) confirming the bioactivity of the adsorbed BP. XPS spectra of plasma sprayed HA-coated discs exposed to a 10 mM aqueous BP solution (pamidronate) for periods of 1, 2 and 24 h showed nitrogen and phosphorous photoelectron signals corresponding to the BP, confirming its adsorption onto the HA substrate. XPS depth profiling of the 2 h BP-exposed HA discs showed penetration of the BP into the HA matrix to depths of at least 260 nm. The bioactivity of the adsorbed BP was confirmed by the observed inhibition of osteoclast (bone resorbing) cell activity. In comparison to the HA sample, the HA sample with adsorbed BP exhibited a 25-fold decrease in primary osteoclast cells.\n\nXPS and UPS studies on electronic structure of Li 2O\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTanaka, Satoru; Taniguchi, Masaki; Tanigawa, Hisashi\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThe adsorption behavior of H 2O on Li 2O was studied by X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photo electron spectroscopy (UPS). XPS and UPS spectra of Li 2O single crystals which were exposed to different pressure of H 2O vapor were observed. In O(1s) region, two peaks were observed and they were assigned to O(1s) in precipitated LiOH on the surface and O(1s) in Li 2O. After H 2O exposure, a peak broadening and an appearance of a new peak were observed at the higher binding energy region than O(1s) in Li 2O. They were attributed to surface -OH and H 2O molecule adsorbed on the surface. The adsorption behavior of H 2O was discussed from the observation of electronic structure in Li 2O surface.\n\nTranscription analysis of pilS and xpsEL genes from Xylella fastidiosa.\n\nPubMed\n\nColtri, Patricia P; Rosato, Yoko B\n\n2005-04-01\n\nXylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited phytopathogen responsible for diseases in several plants such as citrus and coffee. Analysis of the bacterial genome revealed some putative pathogenicity-related genes that could help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of plant-pathogen interactions. In the present work, the transcription of three genes of the bacterium, grown in defined and rich media and also in media containing host plant extracts (sweet orange, 'ponkan' and coffee) was analyzed by RT-PCR. The pilS gene, which encodes a sensor histidine kinase responsible for the biosynthesis of fimbriae, was transcribed when the bacterium was grown in more complex media such as PW and in medium containing plant extracts. The xps genes (xpsL and xpsE) which are related to the type II secretion system were also detected when the bacterium was grown in rich media and media with 'ponkan' and coffee extracts. It was thus observed that pilS and xpsEL genes of X. fastidiosa can be modulated by environmental factors and their expression is dependent on the nutritional status of the growth medium.\n\nTheoretical modeling of the uranium 4f XPS for U(VI) and U(IV) oxides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBagus, Paul S.; Nelin, Connie J.; Ilton, Eugene S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nA rigorous study is presented of the physical processes related to X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS, in the 4f level of U oxides, which, as well as being of physical interest in themselves, are representative of XPS in heavy metal oxides. In particular, we present compelling evidence for a new view of the screening of core-holes that extends prior understandings. Our analysis of the screening focuses on the covalent mixing of high lying U and O orbitals as opposed to the, more common, use of orbitals that are nominally pure U or pure O. It is shown that this covalent mixing is quite different for the initial and final, core-hole, configurations and that this difference is directly related to the XPS satellite intensity. Furthermore, we show that the high-lying U d orbitals as well as the U(5f) orbital may both contribute to the core-hole screening, in contrast with previous work that has only considered screening through the U(5f) shell. The role of modifying the U-O interaction by changing the U-O distance has been investigated and an unexpected correlation between U-O distance and XPS satellite intensity has been discovered. The role of flourite and octahedral crystal structures for U(IV) oxides has been examined and relationships established between XPS features and the covalent interactions in the different structures. The physical views of XPS satellites as arising from shake processes or as arising from ligand to metal charge transfers are contrasted; our analysis provides strong support that shake processes give a more fundamental physical understanding than charge transfer. Our theoretical studies are based on rigorous, strictly ab initio determinations of the electronic structure of embedded cluster models of U oxides with formal U(VI) and U(IV) oxidation states. Our results provide a foundation that makes it possible to establish quantitative relationships between features of the XPS spectra and materials properties.\n\nCompositional and surface characterization of HULIS by UV-Vis, FTIR, NMR and XPS: Wintertime study in Northern India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, Varun; Goel, Anubha; Rajput, Prashant\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis study (first attempt) characterizes HULIS (Humic Like Substances) in wintertime aerosols (n = 12 during day and nighttime each) from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP, at Kanpur) by using various state-of-the art techniques such as UV-VIS, FTIR, 1H NMR and XPS. Based on UV-Vis analysis the absorption coefficient at 365 nm (babs-365) of HULIS was found to average at 13.6 and 28.8 Mm-1 during day and nighttime, respectively. Relatively high babs-365 of HULIS during the nighttime is attributed to influence of fog-processing. However, the power fit of UV-Vis spectrum provided near similar AAE (absorption Angstrom exponent) value of HULIS centering at 4.9 Â± 1.4 and 5.1 Â± 1.3 during daytime and nighttime, respectively. FTIR spectra and its double derivative revealed the presence of various functional groups viz. alcohols, ketones aldehydes, carboxylic acids as well as unsaturated and saturated carbon bonds. 1H NMR spectroscopy was applied to quantify relative percentage of various types of hydrogen atoms contained in HULIS, whereas XPS technique provided information on surface composition and oxidation states of various elements present. A significantly high abundance of HâCâO group has been observed in HULIS (based on 1H NMR); 41.4Â± 2.7% and 30.9Â± 2.4% in day and nighttime, respectively. However, aromatic protons (Ar-H) were higher in nighttime samples (19.3Â± 1.8%) as compared to that in daytime samples (7.5 Â± 1.9). XPS studies revealed presence of various species on the surface of HULIS samples. Carbon existed in 7 different chemical states while total nitrogen and sulfur exhibited 3 and 2 different oxidation states (respectively) on the surface of HULIS. This study reports structural information and absorption properties of HULIS which has implications to their role as cloud condensation nuclei and atmospheric direct radiative forcing.\n\nChemical Visualization of a GaN p-n junction by XPS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaliskan, Deniz; Sezen, Hikmet; Ozbay, Ekmel; Suzer, Sefik\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe report on an operando XPS investigation of a GaN diode, by recording the Ga2p3/2 peak position under both forward and reverse bias. Areal maps of the peak positions under reverse bias are completely decoupled with respect to doped regions and allow a novel chemical visualization of the p-n junction in a 2-D fashion. Other electrical properties of the device, such as leakage current, resistivity of the domains are also tapped via recording line-scan spectra. Application of a triangular voltage excitation enables probing photoresponse of the device.

The cross section is plotted as a function of incident electron energy, which determines which resonant anion state is populated, i.e., along which normal coordinate the wave packet is launched, and of the electron energy loss, which reveals into which final states each specific resonant state decays. The 2D spectra are presented for acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, at the incident energy range 0.095-1.0 eV, where the incoming electron is temporarily captured in the lowest Ïâ orbital. The 2D spectra reveal selectivity patterns with respect to which vibrations are excited in the attachment and de-excited in the detachment. Further insight is gained by recording 1D spectra measured along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal cuts of the 2D spectrum. The methyl group in methacrylonitrile increases the resonance width 7 times. This converts the sharp resonances of acrylonitrile into boomerang structures but preserves the essence of the selectivity patterns. Selectivity of vibrational excitation by higher-lying shape resonances up to 8 eV is also reported.\n\nAFM AND XPS Characterization of Zinc-Aluminum Alloy Coatings with Attention to Surface Dross and Flow Lines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarding, Felipe A.; Alarcon, Nelson A.; Toledo, Pedro G.\n\nSurfaces of various zinc-aluminum alloy (Zn-Al) coated steel samples are studied with attention to foreign surface dross by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/ESCA). AFM topographic maps of zinc-aluminum alloy surfaces free of dross reveal the perfect nanoscale details of two kinds of dendrites: branched and globular. In all magnifications the dendrites appear smooth and, in general, very clean. XPS analysis of the extreme surface of a Zn-Al sample reveals Al, Zn, Si and O as the main components. The XPS results show no segregation or separation of phases other than those indicated by the ternary Al-Zn-Si diagram. For surfaces of Zn-Al plagued with impurities, high resolution AFM topographic maps reveal three situations: (1) areas with well-defined dendrites, relatively free of dross; (2) areas with small, millimeter-sized black spots known as dross; and (3) areas with large black stains, known as flow lines. Dendrite deformation and dross accumulation increase notably in the neighborhood, apparently clean to the naked eye, of dross or flow lines. XPS results of areas with dross and flow lines indicate unacceptable high concentration of Si and important Si phase separation. These results, in the light of AFM work, reveal that dross and flow lines are a consequence of a high local concentration of Si from high melting point silica and silicate impurities in the Zn-Al alloy source.\n\nXPS and EELS characterization of Mn2SiO4, MnSiO3 and MnAl2O4\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrosvenor, A. P.; Bellhouse, E. M.; Korinek, A.; Bugnet, M.; McDermid, J. R.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are strong candidate techniques for characterizing steel surfaces and substrate-coating interfaces when investigating the selective oxidation and reactive wetting of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) during the continuous galvanizing process. However, unambiguous identification of ternary oxides such as Mn2SiO4, MnSiO3, and MnAl2O4 by XPS or EELS, which can play a significant role in substrate reactive wetting, is difficult due to the lack of fully characterized standards in the literature. To resolve this issue, samples of Mn2SiO4, MnSiO3 and MnAl2O4 were synthesized and characterized by XPS and EELS. The unique features of the XPS and EELS spectra for the Mn2SiO4, MnSiO3 and MnAl2O4 standards were successfully derived, thereby allowing investigators to fully differentiate and identify these oxides at the surface and subsurface of Mn, Si and Al alloyed AHSS using these techniques.\n\nA comparative theoretical study on core-hole excitation spectra of azafullerene and its derivatives\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDeng, Yunfeng; Department of Physics, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025; Gao, Bin, E-mail: bin.gao@uit.no\n\n2014-03-28\n\nThe core-hole excitation spectraânear-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS), x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shake-up satellites have been simulated at the level of density functional theory for the azafullerene C{sub 59}N and its derivatives (C{sub 59}N){sup +}, C{sub 59}HN, (C{sub 59}N){sub 2}, and C{sub 59}NâC{sub 60}, in which the XPS shake-up satellites were simulated using our developed equivalent core hole Kohn-Sham (ECH-KS) density functional theory approach [B. Gao, Z. Wu, and Y. Luo, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 234704 (2008)] which aims for the study of XPS shake-up satellites of large-scale molecules. Our calculated spectra are generally inmoreÂ Â» good agreement with available experimental results that validates the use of the ECH-KS method in the present work. The nitrogen K-edge NEXAFS, XES, and XPS shake-up satellites spectra in general can be used as fingerprints to distinguish the azafullerene C{sub 59}N and its different derivatives. Meanwhile, different carbon K-edge spectra could also provide detailed information of (local) electronic structures of different molecules. In particular, a peak (at around 284.5 eV) in the carbon K-edge NEXAFS spectrum of the heterodimer C{sub 59}NâC{sub 60} is confirmed to be related to the electron transfer from the C{sub 59}N part to the C{sub 60} part in this charge-transfer complex.Â«Â less\n\nRondorfite-type structure â XPS and UVâvis study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDulski, M., E-mail: mateusz.dulski@smcebi.edu.pl; A.Chelkowski Institute of Physics, University of Silesia, Uniwersytecka 4, 40-007 Katowice; Bilewska, K., E-mail: kbilewska@us.edu.pl\n\n2015-10-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ Structural and spectroscopic characterization of chlorosilicate mineral, rondorfite. â¢ Characterization of main photoemission lines and valence band spectra. â¢ The study of color originâs using UVâvis spectroscopy. â¢ Analysis of structural changes in context of origin of natural fluorescence. â¢ Discussion of a new application possibilities of analyzed mineral - Abstract: This paper focuses on X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron and UVâvis spectroscopy of two different (green, orange) rondorfite samples. The differences in the sample color originate from various O/Cl ratios. The orange color was found to be related either to the isomorphic substitution of Fe{sup 3+}/Al{sup 3+} formoreÂ Â» Mg{sup 2+}, the presence of atypical [MgO{sub 4}] tetrahedrons in crystal structure or electronegativity of the sample. The tetrahedron is known to be very prone to accumulation of impurities and substitute atoms. Moreover, the XPS data showed tetrahedrally coordinated Mg{sup 2+} and isomorphic substitution of Al{sup 3+}/Fe{sup 3+} for Mg{sup 2+}, which influences local disordering and the point defects density and distribution. Non-equilibrium chlorine positions inside the crystal cages as well as Ca-Cl bonds have also been found. The XPS measurements as a function of temperature indicate occurrence of a structural transformation at about 770 K which is accompanied by a rotation of silicate tetrahedra within magnesiosilicate pentamer and luminescence disappearance.Â«Â less\n\nQuantifying the Impact of Nanoparticle Coatings and Non-uniformities on XPS Analysis: Gold/silver Core-shell Nanoparticles\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWang, Yung-Chen Andrew; Engelhard, Mark H.; Baer, Donald R.\n\n2016-03-07\n\nAbstract or short description: Spectral modeling of photoelectrons can serve as a valuable tool when combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Herein, a new version of the NIST Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA 2.0) software, capable of directly simulating spherical multilayer NPs, was applied to model citrate stabilized Au/Ag-core/shell nanoparticles (NPs). The NPs were characterized using XPS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to determine the composition and morphology of the NPs. The Au/Ag-core/shell NPs were observed to be polydispersed in size, non-circular, and contain off-centered Au-cores. Using the average NP dimensions determined from STEM analysis,moreÂ Â» SESSA spectral modeling indicated that washed Au/Ag-core shell NPs were stabilized with a 0.8 nm lÂ«Â less\n\nEffects of the low Earth orbit space environment on the surface chemistry of Kapton polyimide film: An XPS study\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Myung; Rooney, William; Whiteside, James\n\n1992-01-01\n\nKapton H (DuPont Trademark) polyimide specimens exposed to the low earth (LEO) space environment suffered significant weathering with surface erosions of approximately 8.0 microns. Despite these effects, no significant changes in bulk chemistry were observed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine local changes induced from approximately 25 percent in 1980 vintage ground control specimens to nearly 53 percent in space exposed specimens. The greatest increase was observed for the divalent oxygen moieties, although a slight increase in carbonyl oxygen was also measured. Furthermore, the chemical shifts of all XPS peaks of space-exposed Kapton are shifted to higher energy. This is consistent with a higher oxidation state of the space exposed surface. Finally, space exposed specimens had distinct silicon peaks (2p 100 eV and 2s 149 eV) in their XPS spectra in agreement with widespread reports of silicon contamination throughout the LDEF satellite. These results are discussed in terms of surface reactivity of the polyimide exposed to the LEO environment and the chemical nature of contaminants deposited on flight surfaces due to satellite outgassing.\n\nThe Effect of Thermal and Mechanical Treatments on Kaolinite: Characterization by XPS and IEP Measurements.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres SÃ¡nchez RM; Basaldella; Marco\n\n1999-07-15\n\nThe surface transformations induced on kaolinite by different thermal and mechanical treatments have been investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Bremsstrahlung induced Auger spectroscopy, and isoelectric point (IEP) measurements. Heating the kaolinite at temperatures between 500 and 750 degrees C results in the change of a substantial fraction of surface Al from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination, which we associate with the dehydroxylation of kaolinite. Heating at 900 and 980 degrees C brings about the development of an octahedral Al fraction which is associated with the formation of gamma-Al(2)O(3). The development of an Al tetrahedral component in the Al KLL spectra of the mechanically treated (ground) samples has been also observed. The Si/Al atomic ratio obtained by XPS in the thermally treated samples is the same as that shown by the original kaolinite. However, the XPS data show a clear reduction of the Si/Al atomic ratio in the mechanically treated samples, which suggests that the mechanical treatment has induced an Al enrichment of the kaolinite surface. The IEP values indicated a thermal transformation to metakaolinite and mullite with the increase of temperature (750 to 980 degrees C). The IEP change for the milled samples can be only explained by assuming a 30% kaolinite coating by the Al oxide neoformed by grinding.

D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTribotests performed on boron-based thermal films have revealed higher mechanical durability and lower wear coefficients compared to results from tests performed on boron-free thermal films. In the current study, in order to follow and identify the tribochemical reactions taking place in the contact regions, post-characterization has been carried out on the steel ball and on the steel disc. The techniques adopted to achieve this goal were small-area X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The contact areas have been investigated before and after failure of the thermal films, revealing thermal-film removal inside the wear track on the disc and the presence of a transfer film in the contact area on the steel ball following tribotesting. Furthermore, borate contributions in the deeper layers within the tribo-stressed area on the disc were revealed at the end of the tribotest. These procedures shed light on the tribomechanical and tribochemical reactions taking place in the contact region, on the ability of boron species to sustain tribological stress and provide mechanical stability, and on the mechanical-mixing processes occurring within the sliding contacts. The mass spectra collected before tribotesting on all thermal films suggest the presence of phosphate- and borate-containing structures.\n\nSurface and electronic structure of Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O superconductors studied by LEED, UPS and XPS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Z.-X.; Lindberg, P.

The surface structure of the single crystals was characterized by LEED to be consistent with that of the bulk structure. Our data suggest that Bi2CaSr2Cu2O8 single crystals are very stable in the ultrahigh vacuu. No change of XPS spectra with temperature was observed. We have also studied the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CuO6, which has a lower superconducting transition temperature Tc. Comparing the electronic structure of the two Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O superconductors, an important difference in the density of states near EF was observed which seems to be related to the difference in Tc.\n\nStructural, XPS and magnetic studies of pulsed laser deposited Fe doped Eu{sub 2}O{sub 3} thin film\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKumar, Sandeep; Prakash, Ram, E-mail: rpgiuc@gmail.com; Choudhary, R.J.\n\n2015-10-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ Growth of Fe doped Eu{sub 2}O{sub 3} thin films by PLD. â¢ XRD and Ramanâs spectroscopy used for structure confirmation. â¢ The electronic states of Eu and Fe are confirmed by XPS. â¢ Magnetic properties reveals room temperature magnetic ordering in deposited film. - Abstract: Fe (4 at.%) doped europium (III) oxide thin film was deposited on silicon (1 0 0) substrate by pulsed laser deposition technique.

XRD and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the grown film is singlemoreÂ Â» phased and belongs to the cubic structure of Eu{sub 2}O{sub 3}. XPS study of the Eu{sub 1.92}Fe{sub 0.08}O{sub 3} film shows that Fe exists in Fe{sup 3+} ionic state in the film.

Such large TMR values are predicted by theory due to the high degree of order apparent in the barrier and electrode materials. However, as grown ultra-thin MgO films generally contain defects that can influence electron transport properties through the creation of low energy states within the bulk MgO band-gap. We will report the results of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of (001) textured ultra-thin MgO layers that are prepared by RF magnetron sputtering and electron beam evaporation on ordered ferromagnetic electrodes and in ordered MTJ structures with and without post growth vacuum annealing. XPS spectra for both MgO deposition techniques clearly indicate a surface oxygen species that is likely bound by defects in the oxide^(3) in half-formed junctions and improvements in MgO quality after counter electrode deposition. We will discuss our results regarding the chemical properties of the oxide and its interfaces directed towards possibly providing guidance to engineer improved MgO MTJ devices. [1] S.S.P.

P.; Grunthaner, F. J.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA simple method of determining oxide uniformity is derived which requires no knowlege of film thickness, escape depth, or film composition. The method involves only the measurement of oxide and substrate intensities and is illustrated by analysis of XPS spectral data for thin SiO2 films grown both thermally and by low-temperature chemical vapor deposition on monocrystalline Si. A region 20-30 A thick is found near the SiO2/Si interface on thermally oxidized samples which has an inelastic mean free path 35% less than that found in the bulk oxide. This is interpreted as being due to lattice mismatch resulting in a strained region which is structurally, but not stoichiometrically, distinct from the bulk oxide.\n\nComparing XPS on bare and capped ZrN films grown by plasma enhanced ALD: Effect of ambient oxidation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMuneshwar, Triratna; Cadien, Ken\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this article we compare x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on bare- and capped- zirconium nitride (ZrN) films to investigate the effect of ambient sample oxidation on the detected bound O in the form of oxide ZrO2 and/or oxynitride ZrOxNy. ZrN films in both bare- and Al2O3/AlN capped- XPS samples were grown by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technique using tetrakis dimethylamino zirconium (TDMAZr) precursor, forming gas (5% H2, rest N2) inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and as received research grade process gases under identical process conditions. Capped samples were prepared by depositing 1 nm thick PEALD AlN on ZrN, followed by additional deposition of 1 nm thick ALD Al2O3, without venting of ALD reactor. On bare ZrN sample at room temperature, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements with increasing ambient exposure times (texp) showed a self-limiting surface oxidation with the oxide thickness (dox) approaching 3.7 Â± 0.02 nm for texp > 120 min. In XPS data measured prior to sample sputtering (tsput = 0), ZrO2 and ZrOxNy were detected in bare- samples, whereas only ZrN and Al2O3/AlN from capping layer were detected in capped- samples. For bare-ZrN samples, appearance of ZrO2 and ZrOxNy up to sputter depth (dsput) of 15 nm in depth-profile XPS data is in contradiction with measured dox = 3.7 nm, but explained from sputtering induced atomic inter-diffusion within analyzed sample. Appearance of artifacts in the XPS spectra from moderately sputtered (dsput = 0.2 nm and 0.4 nm) capped-ZrN sample, provides an evidence to ion-bombardment induced modifications within analyzed sample.\n\nXPS study of the surface chemistry of UO2 (111) single crystal film\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaslakov, Konstantin I.; Teterin, Yury A.; Popel, Aleksej J.; Teterin, Anton Yu.; Ivanov, Kirill E.; Kalmykov, Stepan N.; Petrov, Vladimir G.; Springell, Ross; Scott, Thomas B.; Farnan, Ian\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA (111) air-exposed surface of UO2 thin film (150 nm) on (111) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) before and after the Ar+ etching and subsequent in situ annealing in the spectrometer analytic chamber was studied by XPS technique. The U 5f, U 4f and O 1s electron peak intensities were employed for determining the oxygen coefficient kO = 2 + x of a UO2+x oxide on the surface. It was found that initial surface (several nm) had kO = 2.20. A 20 s Ar+ etching led to formation of oxide UO2.12, whose composition does not depend significantly on the etching time (up to 180 s). Ar+ etching and subsequent annealing at temperatures 100-380 Â°C in vacuum was established to result in formation of stable well-organized structure UO2.12 reflected in the U 4f XPS spectra as high intensity (â¼28% of the basic peak) shake-up satellites 6.9 eV away from the basic peaks, and virtually did not change the oxygen coefficient of the sample surface. This agrees with the suggestion that a stable (self-assembling) phase with the oxygen coefficient kO â 2.12 forms on the UO2 surface.\n\nXPS and XANES studies of biomimetic composites based on B-type nano-hydroxyapatite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoloshchapov, D.

Yu.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe paper presents an investigation of the local atomic structure of nanocrystalline carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite (CHAP) contained in biomimetic composites - analogues of intact human tooth tissues. Using the XPS technique, the presence of impurity Mg and F atoms and structurally bound carbon in CHAP, at the concentrations typical of apatite enamel and dentine was determined. The XANES method was used to study the changes occurring in P L2,3 spectra of biocomposites with CHAP, depending on the percentage of the amino acid matrix. The appearance of maxima in the spectra of XANES P L2,3 near 135.7 eV for the samples with the composition of amino acid complex/hydroxyapatite - 5/95, 25/75 and the splitting of a broad peak of 146.9 eV in the spectrum of a biocomposite with a composition of 40/60 indicates at the interaction of molecular complex of amino acids with atomic environment of phosphorus. This fact can be used in the fundamental medicine for synthesizing of new biomaterials in dentistry.\n\nX ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of Photosensitive ZrO2 array\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Y.; Zhao, G.; Zhu, R.; Kou, Z.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBased on organic zirconium source as the starting material, by adding chemical modifiers which are made up with photosensitive ZrO2 sol.

And studied the ultraviolet light in the process of the variation of the XPS spectra, Zr3d5/2 to 184.9 eV corresponding to the binding energy of the as the combination of state peak gradually reduce; By combining with the status of Zr-O peak gradually increase; The strength of the peak is gradually decline. This suggests that in the process of ultraviolet light photo chemical reaction happened. This study is of great significance to the micro fabrication of ZrO2 array not only to the memory devices but also to the optical devices.\n\nStructure, spectra and thermal, mechanical, Faraday rotation properties of novel diamagnetic SeO2-PbO-Bi2O3-B2O3 glasses\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Qiuling; Su, Kai; Li, Yantao; Zhao, Zhiwei\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFaraday rotation diamagnetic glass has attracted research attentions in photonics, sensing and magneto optical devices due to their high refractive index, wide transmittance in UV and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) range and temperature independent Faraday rotation. Selenite modified heavy metal oxides glasses with composition of xSeO2-(10-x) B2O3-45PbO-45Bi2O3 (x = 0, 1, 5 and 10mol%) and 15%SeO2-40%PbO-45%Bi2O3 have been fabricated by melt-quenching method in present study. The influence of SeO2 on glass forming ability, thermal, mechanical properties and Faraday rotation were evaluated through X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectra (FT-IR), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Vicker's hardness and Verdet constant measurements. XRD spectra reveal that the good vitrification was achieved for glass with SeO2 amounts â¤10% even without B2O3. FT-IR, Raman and XPS spectra ascertain the existence of characteristic vibration of SeO4, SeO3, PbO4, BiO3 and BO3 units. The incorporation of SeO2 increases the connectivity of glassy network by increasing the Tg, thermal stability and mechanical hardness. The small band gap, high polarizable Se4+ ions and isolated SeO3 units contribute to Faraday rotation improvement.\n\nA perspective on two chemometrics tools: PCA and MCR, and introduction of a new one: Pattern recognition entropy (PRE), as applied to XPS and ToF-SIMS depth profiles of organic and inorganic materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChatterjee, Shiladitya; Singh, Bhupinder; Diwan, Anubhav; Lee, Zheng Rong; Engelhard, Mark H.; Terry, Jeff; Tolley, H. Dennis; Gallagher, Neal B.; Linford, Matthew R.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are much used analytical techniques that provide information about the outermost atomic and molecular layers of materials. In this work, we discuss the application of multivariate spectral techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution (MCR), to the analysis of XPS and ToF-SIMS depth profiles. Multivariate analyses often provide insight into data sets that is not easily obtained in a univariate fashion. Pattern recognition entropy (PRE), which has its roots in Shannon's information theory, is also introduced. This approach is not the same as the mutual information/entropy approaches sometimes used in data processing. A discussion of the theory of each technique is presented. PCA, MCR, and PRE are applied to four different data sets obtained from: a ToF-SIMS depth profile through ca. 100 nm of plasma polymerized C3F6 on Si, a ToF-SIMS depth profile through ca. 100 nm of plasma polymerized PNIPAM (poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)) on Si, an XPS depth profile through a film of SiO2 on Si, and an XPS depth profile through a film of Ta2O5 on Ta. PCA, MCR, and PRE reveal the presence of interfaces in the films, and often indicate that the first few scans in the depth profiles are different from those that follow. PRE and backward difference PRE provide this information in a straightforward fashion. Rises in the PRE signals at interfaces suggest greater complexity to the corresponding spectra. Results from PCA, especially for the higher principal components, were sometimes difficult to understand. MCR analyses were generally more interpretable.\n\nXPS/NEXAFS spectroscopic and conductance studies of glycine on AlGaN/GaN transistor devices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMyers, Matthew; Khir, Farah Liyana Muhammad; Home, Michael A.; Mennell, Christopher; Gillbanks, Jeremy; Tadich, Anton; Baker, Murray V.; Nener, Brett D.; Parish, Giacinta\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe report on a study using a combination of XPS/NEXAFS and conductivity measurements to develop a fundamental understanding of how dipolar molecules interact with the heterostructure device surface and affect the device conductivity of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure-based transistors. In such structures, which are increasingly being investigated for chemical and biological sensing, a 2-dimensional electron gas spontaneously forms at the layer interface that is sensitive to the charge characteristics of the exposed surface. Glycine, chosen for this study because it is the simplest of the amino acids and is known to form a zwitterionic configuration when stabilized through intermolecular interactions, was evaporated under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto the device surface and subsequently both XPS/NEXAFS and conductivity measurements were conducted. NEXAFS spectra show a preferential orientation for the Glycine molecules on the surface and evidence for both neutral and zwitterionic species on the surface. In situ conductivity measurements suggest that the negatively charged carboxylate group is closest to the surface. These results are a unique and pivotal contribution to the previous and at times conflicting literature on the zwitterionic nature of Glycine.\n\nStability of boron-doped graphene/copper interface: DFT, XPS and OSEE studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoukhvalov, D.

Z.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTwo different types of boron-doped graphene/copper interfaces synthesized using two different flow rates of Ar through the bubbler containing the boron source were studied. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and optically stimulated electron emission (OSEE) measurements have demonstrated that boron-doped graphene coating provides a high corrosion resistivity of Cu-substrate with the light traces of the oxidation of carbon cover. The density functional theory calculations suggest that for the case of substitutional (graphitic) boron-defect only the oxidation near boron impurity is energetically favorable and creation of the vacancies that can induce the oxidation of copper substrate is energetically unfavorable. In the case of non-graphitic boron defects oxidation of the area, a nearby impurity is metastable that not only prevent oxidation but makes boron-doped graphene. Modeling of oxygen reduction reaction demonstrates high catalytic performance of these materials.\n\nXPS analysis of activated carbon supported ionic liquids: Enhanced purity and reduced charging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFoelske-Schmitz, A.; Weingarth, D.; KÃ¶tz, R.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nHerein we report on XPS measurements on five different [EMIM] based ionic liquids (IL) prepared on activated carbon and aluminium supports. The anions were [TFSI], [BF4], [FAP], [B(CN)4] and [EtOSO3]. The results show that impurities such as O, Si or hydrocarbons were significantly reduced or no longer detected when preparation was performed on the high surface area carbon support. All core level spectra were fitted and for [EMIM][FAP], [EMIM][B(CN)4] and [EMIM][EtOSO3] de-convolution procedures of the C 1s lines are suggested. Comparison of the determined binding energies with published data strongly suggests that sample charging is irrelevant when preparation is performed on the activated carbon support. This observation is supposed to refer to the high capacitance of the high surface area carbon.\n\nTutorial: Novel properties of defects in semiconductors revealed by their vibrational spectra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStavola, Michael; Fowler, W. Beall\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis is an introductory survey of the vibrational spectroscopy of defects in semiconductors that contain light-mass elements. The capabilities of vibrational spectroscopy for the identification of defects, the determination of their microscopic structures, and their dynamics are illustrated by a few examples. Several additional examples are discussed, with a focus on defects with properties not obviously accessible by vibrational spectroscopy, such as the diffusivity of an impurity, the negative U ordering of electronic levels, and the time constant for a nuclear-spin flip. These novel properties have, nonetheless, been revealed by vibrational spectra and their interpretation by theory.\n\nXPS and 31P NMR inquiry of Eu3+-induced structural modification in SnO-containing phosphate glass\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJimÃ©nez, JosÃ© A.; Fachini, Esteban Rosim; Zhao, Chunqing\n\n2018-07-01\n\nThe influence of Eu3+ doping on the structural properties of SnO-containing phosphate glass has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Oxygen 1s XPS data indicates that the Eu3+ doping results in a higher concentration of non-bridging oxygens in the glass matrix, whereas 31P NMR shows an increase in the terminal phosphate chain tetrahedral units, i.e. the amount of Q1 sites with only one bridging oxygen. Accordingly, both techniques agree with a depolymerization effect induced by the Eu3+ ions. Further, XPS reveals that together with the Eu3+ doping, the presence of Sn4+ is supported while the presence of Eu2+ is also indicated. The structural changes are then indicated to be a consequence of redox chemistry between Sn2+ and Eu3+ promoting a transition of tin from Sn2+ with a role as network former to Sn4+ acting as network modifier in the glass system.\n\nXPS Protocol for the Characterization of Pristine and Functionalized Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSosa, E.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has proved to be a useful analytical tool for nanoscale surface characterization of materials including carbon nanotubes. Recent nanotechnology research at NASA Johnson Space Center (NASA-JSC) helped to establish a characterization protocol for quality assessment for single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Here, a review of some of the major factors of the XPS technique that can influence the quality of analytical data, suggestions for methods to maximize the quality of data obtained by XPS, and the development of a protocol for XPS characterization as a complementary technique for analyzing the purity and surface characteristics of SWCNTs is presented. The XPS protocol is then applied to a number of experiments including impurity analysis and the study of chemical modifications for SWCNTs.\n\nVersatile technique for assessing thickness of 2D layered materials by XPS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZemlyanov, Dmitry Y.; Jespersen, Michael; Zakharov, Dmitry N.; Hu, Jianjun; Paul, Rajib; Kumar, Anurag; Pacley, Shanee; Glavin, Nicholas; Saenz, David; Smith, Kyle C.; Fisher, Timothy S.; Voevodin, Andrey A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been utilized as a versatile method for thickness characterization of various two-dimensional (2D) films. Accurate thickness can be measured simultaneously while acquiring XPS data for chemical characterization of 2D films having thickness up to approximately 10 nm. For validating the developed technique, thicknesses of few-layer graphene (FLG), MoS2 and amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) layer, produced by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) respectively, were accurately measured. The intensity ratio between photoemission peaks recorded for the films (C 1s, Mo 3d, B 1s) and the substrates (Cu 2p, Al 2p, Si 2p) is the primary input parameter for thickness calculation, in addition to the atomic densities of the substrate and the film, and the corresponding electron attenuation length (EAL). The XPS data was used with a proposed model for thickness calculations, which was verified by cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurement of thickness for all the films. The XPS method determines thickness values averaged over an analysis area which is orders of magnitude larger than the typical area in cross-sectional TEM imaging, hence provides an advanced approach for thickness measurement over large areas of 2D materials. The study confirms that the versatile XPS method allows rapid and reliable assessment of the 2D material thickness and this method can facilitate in tailoring growth conditions for producing very thin 2D materials effectively over a large area. Furthermore, the XPS measurement for a typical 2D material is non-destructive and does not require special sample preparation.

The rationale for the particular V-shaped deformed structure is discussed and understood. The moleculeâsurface bond is made evident by mapping the charge redistribution. Upon X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) from the molecule, the bond with the surface is destabilized by the electron density rearrangement to screen the core hole. This destabilization depends on the ionized carbon atom, inducing a narrowing of the XPS spectrum with respect to the molecules adsorbed hypothetically undistorted, in full agreement to experiments. When looking instead at the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra, individual contributions from the non-equivalent C atoms provide evidence of the molecular orbital filling, hybridization, and interchange induced by distortion. The alteration of the CâC bond lengths due to the V-shaped bending decreases by a factor of two the azimuthal dichroism of NEXAFS spectra, i.e., the energy splitting of the sigma resonances measured along the two in-plane molecular axes.

Changes in the state of the silver were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Silver cations in titanosilicate Ag-ETS-10 are fully reduced to Ag(0) at temperatures as low as 150 degrees C. The characteristic features of the XPS spectrum of silver in this Ag-ETS-10 species correspond to only metallic silver. The signal for metallic silver is not observed in the XPS spectrum of aluminosilicate Ag-mordenite, indicating that silver cations are not reduced, even after heating to 350 degrees C.\n\nApplications of XPS in the characterization of Battery materials\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nShutthanandan, Vaithiyalingam; Nandasiri, Manjula; Zheng, Jianming; ...\n\n2018-05-26\n\nIn this study, technological development requires reliable power sources where energy storage devices are emerging as a critical component.

However, it is difficult to make inferences from these data because of the need to disentangle effects of gas absorption from haze extinction. Here, we turn to the quintessential hazy world, Titan, to clarify how high-altitude hazes influence transit spectra. We use solar occultation observations of Titan's atmosphere from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. Data span 0.88-5 Î¼m at a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. Our approach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit radius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering, refraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to explore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong methane-absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most importantly, the data demonstrate that high-altitude hazes can severely limit the atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to pressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. Unlike the usual assumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations of potentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, and creates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to those from the strongest gaseous-absorption features. These findings have important consequences for interpreting future exoplanet observations, including those from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nTitan solar occultation observations reveal transit spectra of a hazy world\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRobinson, Tyler D.; Maltagliati, Luca; Marley, Mark S.; Fortney, Jonathan J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHigh-altitude clouds and hazes are integral to understanding exoplanet observations, and are proposed to explain observed featureless transit spectra.

J.; Smekal, W.; Werner, W. S. M.\n\n2005-09-01\n\nWe describe a new NIST database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA). This database provides data for the many parameters needed in quantitative Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, AES and XPS spectra can be simulated for layered samples. The simulated spectra, for layer compositions and thicknesses specified by the user, can be compared with measured spectra. The layer compositions and thicknesses can then be adjusted to find maximum consistency between simulated and measured spectra. In this way, AES and XPS can provide more detailed characterization of multilayer thin-film materials. We report on the use of SESSA for determining the thicknesses of HfO2, ZrO2, HfSiO4, and ZrSiO4 films on Si by angle-resolved XPS. Practical effective attenuation lengths (EALs) have been computed from SESSA as a function of film thickness and photoelectron emission angle (i.e., to simulate the effects of tilting the sample). These EALs have been compared with similar values obtained from the NIST Electron Effective-Attenuation-Length Database (SRD 82). Generally good agreement was found between corresponding EAL values, but there were differences for film thicknesses less than the inelastic mean free path of the photoelectrons in the overlayer film. These differences are due to a simplifying approximation in the algorithm used to compute EALs in SRD 82. SESSA, with realistic cross sections for elastic and inelastic scattering in the film and substrate materials, is believed to provide more accurate EALs than SRD 82 for thin-film thickness measurements, particularly in applications where the film and substrate have different electron-scattering properties.\n\nCombined PIXE and XPS analysis on republican and imperial Roman coins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaccÃ , A.; Prati, P.; Zucchiatti, A.; Lucarelli, F.; MandÃ², P.

Principle component analysis (PCA) of the pH dependent spectra apparently reveals that only two chemical species are adequate to fully account for the color changes, with which the spectral decomposition is readily performed by using augmented alternative least-squares (ALS) regression analysis. The quantity variation by the ALS analysis also reveals the practical acid dissociation constant, pKaâ§. The determination of pKaâ§ is performed for various ionic strengths, which reveals the thermodynamic acid constant (pKa = 7.5) and the number of charge on each chemical species; the yellow form is negatively charged species of - 1 and the blue form that of - 2. On this chemical information, the quantum chemical calculation is carried out to find that BTB molecules take the pure quinoid form in an acid solution and the quinoid-phenolate form in an alkaline solution. The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for the theoretically determined chemical structures account for the peak shift of the electronic spectra. In this manner, the structures of all the chemical species appeared in equilibrium have finally been confirmed.\n\nA New NIST Database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA): Application to Angle-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of HfO2, ZrO2, HfSiO4, and ZrSiO4 Films on Silicon\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPowell, C.J.; Smekal, W.; Werner, W.S.M.\n\n2005-09-09\n\nWe describe a new NIST database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SESSA).

M.; Nesbitt, H. W.; Ho, R.; Shaw, D. M.; Tse, J. S.; Biesinger, M. C.\n\n2009-08-01\n\nHigh resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) core-level Si2p and O1s spectra of the nonconductors Î±-SiO2 (quartz) at 120 and 300 K and vitreous SiO2 at 300 K were obtained with a Kratos Axis Ultra XPS instrument (instrumental resolution of <0.4eV ) which incorporates a unique charge compensation system that minimizes differential charge broadening on nonconductors. The Si2p and O1s linewidths at 300 K ( Ë1.1 and Ë1.2eV , respectively) are similar for all silicates (and similar to previous thin film SiO2 spectra obtained previously), showing that differential charging does not contribute significantly to our spectra. At 120 K, there is a small decrease (0.04 eV) in the Si2p linewidth of Î±-SiO2 , but no measurable decrease in O1s linewidth. The O1s lines are generally and distinctly asymmetric. We consider all possible sources of line broadening and show that final state vibrational broadening (FSVB) and phonon broadening are the major causes of the broad and asymmetric lines. Previous high resolution gas phase XPS studies have identified large FSVB contributions to the Si2p spectra of SiCl4 , SiF4 , and Si(OCH3)4 molecules, and this vibrational structure leads total Si2p3/2 linewidths of up to Ë0.5eV , even with individual peak linewidths of <0.1eV . The Si atom of Si(OCH3)4 is an excellent analog for Si in crystalline SiO2 because the Si-O bond lengths and symmetric stretch frequencies are similar in both compounds. Similar vibrational contributions to the Si2p and O1s spectra of solid silicates are anticipated if the Si2p and O1s core-hole states produce similar changes to the Si-O bond length in both phases. To investigate the possibility, Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations were performed and show that changes to Si-O bond lengths between ion and ground states (Îr) for both Si2p and O1s hole states are similar for both crystalline SiO2 and gaseous Si(OCH3)4 . Îr are -0.04Ã for Si2p and Ë+0.05Ã for O1s in both compounds.

The SORCE spacecraft has been operating in what is known as Day-Only Operations (DO-Op) mode since February of 2014. In this mode it is not possible to collect data, including dark-counts, when the spacecraft is in eclipse as we did prior to DO-Op. Instead, we take advantage of the position of the XPS filter-wheel, and collect these data when the wheel position is in a \"dark\" position. Further, in this mode dark data are not always available for all observations, requiring an extrapolation in order to calibrate data at these times. To extrapolate, we model this with a piece-wise 2D nonlinear least squares surface fit in the time and temperature dimensions. Our model allows us to calibrate XPS data into the DO-Op phase of the mission by extrapolating along this surface. The XPS version 11 data product release benefits from this new calibration. We present comparisons of the previous and current calibration methods in addition to planned future upgrades of our data products.\n\nDetermination of equilibrium structures of bromothymol blue revealed by using quantum chemistry with an aid of multivariate analysis of electronic absorption spectra.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimada, Toru; Hasegawa, Takeshi\n\n2017-10-05\n\nThe pH dependent chemical structures of bromothymol blue (BTB), which have long been under controversy, are determined by employing a combined technique of multivariate analysis of electronic absorption spectra and quantum chemistry. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the pH dependent spectra apparently reveals that only two chemical species are adequate to fully account for the color changes, with which the spectral decomposition is readily performed by using augmented alternative least-squares (ALS) regression analysis. The quantity variation by the ALS analysis also reveals the practical acid dissociation constant, pK a '. The determination of pK a ' is performed for various ionic strengths, which reveals the thermodynamic acid constant (pK a =7.5) and the number of charge on each chemical species; the yellow form is negatively charged species of -1 and the blue form that of -2. On this chemical information, the quantum chemical calculation is carried out to find that BTB molecules take the pure quinoid form in an acid solution and the quinoid-phenolate form in an alkaline solution. The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for the theoretically determined chemical structures account for the peak shift of the electronic spectra. In this manner, the structures of all the chemical species appeared in equilibrium have finally been confirmed. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.
