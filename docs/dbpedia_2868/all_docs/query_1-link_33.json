        "text": "(14) Mass Observation 1980s\n\nAdded 25 January 2019\n\nDid you write for the Mass Observation project in the period 1980-1989? As part of the further development of the Mass Observation project, the Mass Observation team are collaborating with their historic publishing partner Adam Matthew Digital Limited to digitise and further engage with the academic community. We’re hoping to get in contact with all Mass Observers who contributed to the project in the time period 1980 – 1989 to discuss this exciting project and what it’ll mean for research and academia in the future.\n\nAdam Matthew Digital Limited has a twenty-eight-year history working with libraries and archives to make archival material available on a digital platform and international stage. Their previous work with the Mass Observation team resulted in the fascinating and extensive Mass Observation Online, which made available the papers and material from the early Mass Observation Archive dating from 1937 to the mid-1950s to academics, researchers and students at libraries, universities and archives all over the world. This collection is viewed as an essential insight into the social history of Britain in the 20th century and the continuation of this digital collection will further enhance research and teaching for modern audiences.\n\nIf you, or someone you know, contributed to the Mass Observation project between 1980 and 1989, we’d like to hear from you. Please contact the Mass Observation team at: mao@sussex.ac.uk\n\n(9) Race Relations in America\n\nAdded January 2016\n\nWe are looking to trace copyright holders for a number of speeches and other items contained in the Race Relations Department of the United Church Board for Homeland Ministries records, 1943-1970, housed at The Amistad Research Center, New Orleans.\n\nThe Race Relations Department was established in 1942 to define problem areas related to race relations in the United States, to develop programs and techniques designed to promote constructive action, and to work toward relieving areas of tension utilizing, wherever possible, local resources.
