Categorization suggestions can be directed to the guide editors.\n\nAdam Matthew is a digital publisher of unique primary source collections from around the world. Based in the UK, Adam Matthew has partnered with libraries, archives, and research institutions to make their materials available online for researchers. Each Adam Matthew collection comprises a curated set of materials from a repository that has been digitized and enhanced with metadata, OCR, supplemental essays, and in some cases, Adam Matthew's Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) search technology, delivering document-level full-text search results across all handwritten manuscript documents."
