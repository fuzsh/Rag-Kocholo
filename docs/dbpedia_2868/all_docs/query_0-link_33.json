        "text": "Adam Matthew Digital is delighted to announce today that University of Exeter has become the first European university to purchase its entire digital primary source portfolio of over 100 modules.\n\nThe University, a long-time supporter of AM Digital, made its first digital purchase in 2008, and this week has completed its portfolio, with the addition of all new content publishing in 2019, as well as the entire suite of digitised microfilm.\n\nOliver Stacy, Head of International Sales at AM Digital commented: We are delighted to welcome the University of Exeter to the select group of institutions around the world that have access to the entire Adam Matthew Digital portfolio. This is a landmark moment, opening up a vast body of unique, globally sourced primary source content to an important new academic audience.\n\nExeter's faculty and students can now access all content from the award-winning publisher, including key collections publishing this year: Shakespeare's Globe Archive; Food and Drink in History; and Sex & Sexuality. AM Digital's diverse portfolio, developed in collaboration with leading libraries and archives around the world, spans the social sciences and humanities, with many centuries of manuscript, print and AV content, and the publisher's leading platform technology transforming engagement in video, newspaper, and handwritten materials.\n\nJames Anthony-Edwards, University Librarian commented: Building on the strengths of our existing digital collections, we chose to work with Adam Matthew Digital as part of our 21st Century Research Library project, enhancing access to unique resources for our researchers across the humanities and social sciences. We are at the forefront of providing digitised historic content and these digital archives will enable our academics to expand the depth and scope of their research, opening up new directions from a vast collection of content available at their fingertips. At the same time, students who benefit from our research led approach to education, will be able to use this wide range of resources to develop their skills and put research at the heart of their studies.\"\n\nThis partnership shows Exeter's pioneering approach to collection development, and the team at AM Digital is excited about what this means for the future of European teaching and research across the humanities and social sciences.\n\nTo find out more about the partnership, contact Nia Phillips, UK and Ireland Sales Manager (nia@amdigital.co.uk.)\n\nAbout Adam Matthew Digital\n\nAdam Matthew Digital is an award-winning publisher of primary source content with 30 years' experience identifying and making accessible primary resource collections from leading archives and libraries around the world.
