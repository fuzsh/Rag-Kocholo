This social history archive, digitized for the first time, covers topics such as Thatcherism and the AIDS crisis, events such as the royal wedding of Charles and Diana, and “mundane” everyday life in the U.K. According to Adam Matthew, “Mass Observation Project is the 1981 revival of the original Mass Observation, first launched in 1937. The aim of the project was, and remains, to document the social history of the United Kingdom through the personal responses to a diverse selection of topics, sent in by ‘mass observers’ located across the country. The Mass Observation Archive is now held at the University of Sussex, and is one of Art Council England’s ‘Designated’ collections of national and international importance.”\n\nThe second module, covering the 1990s, will debut in 2021, and the third module, covering the 2000s, will launch in 2022.\n\nFor more information, read the press release.\n\nSend correspondence concerning the Weekly News Digest to NewsBreaks Editor Brandi Scardilli"
