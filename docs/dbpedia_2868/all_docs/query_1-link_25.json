        "text": "Adam Matthew Digital Limited values our relationship with you and recognises the importance of respecting and protecting your personal information and privacy\n\nThis policy (together with any other resources referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal information you provide to us (or data we collect about you from other sources) will be processed (meaning collected, stored, and otherwise used) by us.\n\nPlease read this policy carefully as it sets out what you can expect from us and gives you our contact details if you wish to ask any questions or raise concerns about how we are processing your personal information.\n\nFor the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the data controller is Adam Matthew Digital Ltd, Pelham House, Pelham Court, London Road, Marlborough, SN8 2AG.\n\nThis privacy policy is provided in a layered format so you can click through to the specific areas set out below. We have included a glossary at the end of this privacy policy to explain the meaning of some of the wording we use in this privacy policy.\n\nThe different types of personal information that we collect\n\nPersonal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include information where the identity has been removed (anonymous information).\n\nAdam Matthew Digital Limited is an academic publisher of primary source collections for teaching and research. Our digital resources are used for educational purposes and our customers are academic institutions and libraries.\n\nWe process the following different types of personal information: licensed material personal data, copyright personal data and user personal data. More information on each is set out below.\n\nLicensed material personal data\n\nTo produce our digital resources, we license primary source material from libraries and archives around the world for inclusion in our digital resources. This primary source material sometimes contains personal information, such as names, images, as well as special category personal information. Special category personal information includes information such as details about your ethnicity, religious beliefs, political opinions. We call all of this information licensed material personal data.\n\nLicensed material personal data is processed in the following ways:\n\nwe create digital copies of the material for inclusion in our published, digital resources\n\nwe view digital copies for quality assurance purposes, to ensure they are appropriate and functional in the published resource.\n\nwe index the primary source material to make it searchable (capturing e.g. names, keywords, places)\n\nwe create transcripts and databases of the text to make it searchable\n\nwe may create searchable databases within our resources for data analysis purposes\n\nwe use a limited number of primary sources in our marketing material\n\nwe may redact or remove personal data, including special category personal data, from our primary sources to protect an individual’s personal data using a third-party supplier in a third country.\n\nAs a data controller, the law imposes certain obligations on us in relation to the use, storage and processing of personal information.\n\nHowever, under Data Protection legislation an exemption applies to processing personal information for journalistic purposes and academic, artistic or literary expression (the academic exemption). This exemption means that the majority of the obligations under Data Protection law do not apply to our processing of licensed material personal data.\n\nIn particular, for special category personal information and relying on the academic exemption, we can process Licensed Material Personal Data without your consent and transfer it to countries outside the UK and outside the European Economic Area, including to third party service providers who provide services to us. However, we put in place appropriate security measures in respect of licensed material personal data.\n\nCopyright personal data and user personal data\n\nSometimes we obtain personal information, such as names and addresses and other contact details, from libraries and other archive holders. This information is used by us for researching and contacting copyright holders to request permission to include primary source material in our resource. We call this copyright personal data.\n\nWe collect, store and process personal information from employees of our customers and of our prospective customers, as well as personal information of users (such as students) accessing our digital publications. We call this user personal data and it includes:\n\nidentity and contact data: user names and email addresses of users accessing our digital publications; names, email addresses, telephone number, academic institution, affiliation, job title and subject specialism of employees of our customers and prospective customers;\n\nfinancial data: financial or credit card details, details about payments from our customers and what has been purchased;\n\ntechnical data: internet protocol (IP) address, login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices our customers employees and users use to access our publications and our websites;\n\nusage data: information about how our customers employees and prospective customers employees use our website, products and services;\n\nmarketing data: our customers’ employees and prospective customers’ employees preferences in receiving marketing from us and their communication preferences.\n\nOur obligations and your rights\n\nThe law imposes certain obligations on us in relation to copyright personal data and user personal data.\n\nData protection legislation also gives you a number of rights to protect you against an organisation mishandling this type of personal information. It is important that you understand your rights, and in this policy, we have set out what those rights are and how you can exercise your rights in respect of Adam Matthew Digital Limited processing those types of personal information.\n\nHow we collect copyright personal data and user personal data\n\nInformation you provide to us.
