        "text": "From the early days of the European empires that introduced new and exciting ingredients to Europe, through to mass production and the introduction of the microwave, food and drink is a unique lens through which to view the history of society, empires, migration, business, and trade.\n\nThis new resource from Adam Matthew Digital, Food and Drink in History, focuses on this evolution of food and drink within every day and domestic life, charting key issues around agriculture and food production, and looking into advertising histories of key food and drink brands such as Heinz and J S Fry and Sons.\n\n“The study of food is such an interesting way to view world-changing events from a different perspective. Whether it’s the growth of the British Empire aligned with the business interests of the spice trade, or even the cultural and social impact of the microwave, this collection offers scholars, students, and researchers an exciting way to explore these themes.”\n\nMartha Fogg, Publishing Director, Adam Matthew Digital\n\nThe materials in this digital collection illustrate the deep link between food and identity, politics and power, gender, race, and socio-economic status, as well as charting key issues around agriculture, nutrition, and food production. Material has been sourced from institutions across the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and France, with a focus on gaining as global a view on food history as possible.\n\n“A veritable feast for food and drink scholars across time and space: with primary sources ranging from cookbooks to company records and ephemeral objects, this is a one-stop collection of exciting materials from all over the globe.”\n\nProfessor Beat Kümin, University of Warwick\n\nFood and Drink in History is now available.
