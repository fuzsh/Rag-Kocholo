Sandra Goldbacher, the UK writer-director who impressed buyers at Cannes with her second feature Me Without You, has started work on two contemporary scripts, Faith and Utopia.

Faith is a London-set story about magic and witchcraft, while Utopia is set in a commune in an arctic-like region. Goldbacher, who debuted with The Governess, is writing Faith herself and working on Utopia with Wonderland writer Laurence Coriat, with whom she collaborated on Me Without You. She has also just started writing a new draft of Zola adaptation Nana for Bedrooms And Hallways producer Ceci Dempsey.

"She doesn't want to be pigeonholed," said her London agent Frances Arnold at Rochelle Stevens. "You've never seen so many Jewish period pieces as she got offered after The Governess."

Me Without You, which competes in next month's Venice International Film Festival, triggered strong interest amongst buyers after it screened in the market at Cannes. The story of two girls' friendship from the late seventies to the present day, which stars Anna Friel, Michelle Williams and Kyle MacLachlan, is being handled in the UK by Momentum Pictures and by Capitol Films for international sales.

Industry Entertainment represents Goldbacher in the US.
