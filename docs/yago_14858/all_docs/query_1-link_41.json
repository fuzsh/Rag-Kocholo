        "text": "Ken Russell, film director\n\nAt my local Odeon, there is now a nice bar, disco and restaurant. It's a lively place, and in Southampton there are not many of those. It's a whole evening out now: you have a drink, a meal and there are 10 screens or more. And there are some pretty good films about but they are all American. I liked Spielberg's new film, Minority Report, and Memento. They have intriguing, imaginative subjects, which are the ones that audiences go for.\n\nI think films are getting generally better. In the 60s, I was making films for the Americans because England never asked me to. When the Americans packed up and left, the surrounding excitement went with them. Now Britain makes films about men painting electric pylons. Brits go in for dull, worthy subjects and to get noticed here, you've got to be Scottish, a girl or under 17, otherwise forget it. I can't get films set up here but I can in America. There they seem to cherish their older film-makers.\n\nSandra Goldbacher, film director\n\nI don't think more people are seeing arthouse films. I guess it's down to American blockbusters, rather depressingly. There do seem to be new growing audiences, like younger women. I've been approached by studios to make high-school teen films. There has been a huge market for them in America - like 10 Things I Hate About You - and we follow. It would be nice if they went to see British films.\n\nMike Hodges, film director\n\nI don't know why this is. I don't live in London, and really have no idea what is happening. I just make films. When I was young, in the 40s and 50s, cinema was the only form of mass entertainment other than radio, so everyone went weekly. It is interesting in a world where there are a lot more avenues for entertainment, that cinema seems to be taking precedence. Especially when it looked as if it would be killed by TV. Maybe it says something about the state of TV at the moment. The BBC used to be really good but it's absolute rubbish now. I really object to paying my TV licence.\n\nStephen Frears, film director\n\nI haven't a clue why. I go and see films because I don't like watching videos. Of course it's encouraging, but it doesn't particularly affect what I do. You make the films you have to make; I'm not that calculating. But it's better than people not going to the cinema.\n\nDuncan Kenworthy, film producer\n\nThe British cinema-going average is about 2.7 visits per year, about half of Australia's, which is five, and in America it is a little more than that. So we're not as strong a movie-going nation as we could be. Cinema-going is at the very heart of the British film industry and it would be churlish to see anything but good news in this statistic. But you can have a year when people go to cinemas in record numbers but see fewer films, and I suspect that now until Christmas there will be three movies dominating the box office: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and the latest James Bond.\n\nShane Meadows, film director\n\nI've been shocked to my very core. Most people working on my film haven't worked for 12 months. From the British perspective, it is completely bizarre. Film 4 closes within Britain's biggest cinema going year. Obviously this is an American success. I was expecting almost the opposite news. In this country there is a problem with British-financed films getting audiences. It's the age-old story that American cinemas control the industry, and the films we see in this country. The British boom from when I started is very much over. But I'll stay and fight, or the gap will get bigger and bigger.\n\nRichard Napper, managing director, Columbia Tristar Films UK\n\nIt is wonderful news. The wave of new cinema multiplexes are reaching capacity and there have been a lot of films that really capture the imagination of UK audiences. Cinema-going is firmly back on the agenda. And with Spiderman and Men in Black that I have released, plus Monsters Inc and Star Wars, there is a wave of popularity. Admissions have grown to a projected 175 million for this year.\n\nDistributors are spending more on marketing, with more partner promotions such as screening programmes with magazines, or like the Nokia partnership with Charlie's Angels.\n\nMatt Singleton, duty manager, Warner Village, Leicester Square\n\nPeople have more money than before and there are a lot more event movies coming out.\n\nNatalie Gorf, 21, sales assistant, Odeon, Leicester Square\n\nPeople come to the cinema more because the world is getting too much for them, so they need escapism.\n\nMalcolm Brown, projectionist, Glasgow Film Theatre\n\nBecause the telly is so bad and the papers, particularly the broadsheets, are boring.\n\nRory, 15, cinema-goer\n\nThere's nothing else to do.\n\nLisa, 22, cinema-goer\n\nThey have realised that the cinematic experience is far better than television will ever be. Plus, it brings people together, outside the home."
