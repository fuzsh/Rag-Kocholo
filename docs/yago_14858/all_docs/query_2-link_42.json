        "text": "By Chlotrudis Independent Film Society\n\nRating: 3.8 cats\n\nDirector: Sandra Goldbacher\n\nStarring: Anna Fiel | Michelle Williams | Oliver Milburn | Trudy Styler\n\nCountry: germany, united_kingdom\n\nYear: 2002\n\nRunning time: 107\n\nIMDB: http://us.imdb.com/Details?0263725\n\nMichael says: “The final day of the Boston International Festival of Women’s Cinema kicked off with a film that was being co-presented by the Boston Jewish Film Festival. ME WITHOUT YOU was directed by Sandra Goldbacher, who did the film THE\n\nGOVERNESS (which I didn’t like at all.) ME WITHOUT YOU looks at two women who grew up near London in the 70’s, and remained best friends through the changing decades. As they experiment with drugs, listen to punk music, mature through college and fall in and out of love, their friendship, while hitting some highs, and frequent lows, continues on throughout. As Holly realizes her life is being stifled by the control she allows Marina to have over her, she finally makes the break that will ultimately serve them both.\n\n“ME WITHOUT YOU was surprisingly well done, most notably with the performance of Holly by Dawson’s Creek alum, Michelle Williams (also great in DICK.) Holly struggle through her life being overshadowed by the more flamboyant Marina. Each time she tries to become her own person and assert herself, Marina subtly, or not-so-subtly reigns her back in with deceit, guilt and manipulation. What makes the film work is the way neither friend truly understands what they are doing. It’s all played out on a subconscious level. Great soundtrack, and nice performances make this film work.\n\n“I did have one complaint, and unfortunately, for me, it was a big one. I don’t really like stories about childhood loves that carry on throughout life. I didn’t really enjoy the neat, happy ending of ME WITHOUT YOU, and would have preferred a more satisfying, and still happy ending that didn’t follow an easier, feel-good path. Still, the film was fun, and rather interesting, and I recommend it with reservations.” 3 cats\n\nLaura says: “American Michelle Williams is impressive as a quiet English girl who gradually comes into her own, hurting no one but the mother who’s best prepared her for life. Friel, however, nails the pretty girl who flounders when her surface alone won’t suffice, pulling everyone within reach down with her. The miracle of Friel’s performance is that she manages to maintain sympathy, perhaps best illustrated when her immediate reaction to a kindness from Holly’s father is seduction – when gently rebuffed, her realization and self loathing are evident. Corduner is lovely as that perfect, reactive dad while Findlay’s mom is more proactive, setting up the character for hurt. Trudie Styler bravely portrays an aging swinger as an unflattering signpost for her character’s daughter. Oliver Milburn’s Nat is both dreamily romantic and urgently pragmatic, the perfect man for Holly.\n\n“Art Direction by Steve Carter and Set Decoration by Rebecca Alleway bring the 70s, 80s and present to vivid life. Rosie Hackett’s Costume Design both defines the eras and the friends’ differences. The film’s soundtrack is an 80s’ music lovers’ delight featuring such bands as The Clash, Adam and the Ants and Echo and the Bunnymen.\n\n“ME WITHOUT YOU is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades. With this following the slightly artificial LOVELY & AMAZING, it’s clear that independent film is a much better medium for realistic presentations of female relationships than Hollywood’s Ya Yas.” 4 1/2 cats\n\nFor Laura’s complete review: “http://www.reelingreviews.com/mewithoutyou.htm”\n\nRobin says: “Marina (Anna Friel) and Holly (Michelle Williams) have been next-door neighbors and friends since they were kids. Although the girls are getting older and their interests take different paths there has always been a bond between them. This bond, even when is serves neither of them well, endures regardless in screenwriter/director Sandra Goldbeater decades-spanning ME WITHOUT YOU.\n\n“Don’t be mislead into thinking that, just because this is a movie about two girls and their life long friendship, it won’t have any appeal to guys. Helmer/screenwriter Goldbacher tells a story that anyone who has had a childhood friendship will understand just how that relationship can (and did, for me) start to disintegrate as the friends grow and change into different people, eventually going their separate ways. ME WITHOUT YOU keeps the girls together long past when you would have expected Marina and Holly to part ways. The nicely rendered screenplay gives continuity to what, for most, would have been a long-forgotten friendship. It is a very intelligent and personal what-if story that examines friendship, jealousy, betrayal, love and lust with fair treatment given to all aspects.\n\n“Both of the stars, Anna Friel as the teen/adult Marina and Michelle Williams as Holly, command the screen, but each in a different way. Friel is wild and crazy and lives for the moment and whose gregarious nature takes pity on the bookish, Jewish Holly. Harina, their mutually shared nickname and personality, is an amalgamation of the two girls, one that is dominated by the flamboyant Marina. Holly, though, is not merely a follower and has learned something from all the years of having her nose stuck in books. As the girls get older, the roles change and we see that it is Marina who needs Holly. The characters don’t meld into each other and each actress gives a good, sharp edge to her performance. American Williams doesn’t go overboard with her Brit accent, keeping it subdued enough so I didn’t even think about it. ” 4 cats\n\nFor Robin’s complete review: “http://www.reelingreviews.com/mewithoutyou.htm”"
