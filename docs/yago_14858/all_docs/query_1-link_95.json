        "text": "Steam Media's Sandra Goldbacher is enjoying huge success as part of team behind ITV's 'Victoria' with the programme holding its own against the daunting challenge of BBC's 'Poldark'.\n\nThe director - who splits her time between drama and TVC work - has directed two episodes of the 19th Century drama which has proven quite a hit after being handed the prestigious Sunday evening slot by ITV.\n\nI love a bit of bodice-ripping on a Sunday night. Don't we all! And sometimes it's nice to see it on the television too.\n\nBit cheeky. Which are Sandra Goldbacher's episodes? She directed last week's instalment 'The Clockwork Prince' and next week's which is called 'An Ordinary Woman'.\n\nAs you might expect from the title, last week's dealt with the first meeting between Victoria and her future husband, Prince Albert.\n\nFuture husband! Hey, no spoilers! Um, didn't you study history?\n\nI must have missed school that day... I have literally no idea how this turns out but it looks to me as though she's the kind of tragic Victorian heroine who doesn't make it past chapter four. Er, right. Anyway, it was obviously hugely exciting for Sandra Goldbacher to be asked to direct episodes of a drama which ITV were staking so much on. But not exactly surprising given her track record.\n\nWhat else has she directed? She's something of a period drama specialist. She's directed an episode of 'Endeavour' - the Inspector Morse spin-off which shows he wasn't always a misanthropic old bloke played by John Thaw... once upon a time, he was misanthropic young bloke played by Shaun Evans.\n\nAnd she directed a couple of episodes of 'The Hour' which starred Dominic West, Romola Garai and Ben Whishaw and was basically the film 'Broadcast News' but set in 1950s London. Goldbacher and her fellow directors did a fantastic job with a fairly ludicrous script.\n\nAnd she's directs TVCs, you say. She certainly does. These days she's represented by Steam Media but during stints with other production companies she directed ads for Ferrero Rocher, Kellogg's Special K, Scottish Widows and a trail for Strictly Come Dancing."
