        "text": "Looking at Sandra Goldbacher’s moody, stylised showreel, it is hard to\n\nbelieve that this is the director responsible for two boxing\n\ndocumentaries, and a gritty 90-second film in Channel 4’s current Broke\n\nseries about a 17-year-old Birmingham chambermaid who at night sleeps in\n\na tiny Citroen car.\n\nBut a closer look at the lush ads on the reel, and not least the work\n\nfor Sheridan’s and Northern Rock, betrays a fascination with narrative\n\nsubstance as much as with style. ‘It’s nice to create a certain look,’\n\nGoldbacher says. ‘But I do like working with performers, building\n\ncharacters and creating stories. The feature projects I’m working on,\n\nfor example, are relationship-based and certainly not visual\n\nextravaganzas.’\n\nGoldbacher, having progressed from art school at Middlesex Polytechnic\n\nto the National Film School, started out as a documentary film-maker.\n\nShe was hired by the BBC after graduating and worked on arts\n\ndocumentaries for two-and-a-half years. Then came the boxing films for\n\nChannel 4, one of which was set in a Sheffield gym and included footage\n\nof a young Prince Naseem Hamed, now a world champion.\n\nThe break into commercials directing came with a move to Propaganda, and\n\nthen a switch to Rose Hackney Barber at the beginning of 1996. ‘I\n\ndefinitely see commercials directing as what I do now and if and when\n\nfeature projects happen I think they’ll help my commercials work.\n\nCommercials work is a great opportunity to experiment with different\n\nlooks,’ Goldbacher says.\n\nGoldbacher is currently shooting a Hedex ad for Ogilvy and Mather, which\n\nis the first overtly humorous script she has tackled, although there was\n\nplenty of visual humour in the series for Radio Times that made it on to\n\nher reel. ‘It’s nice to do something funny. I really don’t want to get\n\npigeonholed as a good stylist or as someone who can handle domestic\n\ndrama, which certainly can be a factor for women directors.’\n\nOther new directing projects include feature films - she had a 20-minute\n\nshort at last year’s London Film Festival - and writing more\n\ncommercials’ scripts."
