        "text": "Adam Sandler is to appear in a phone sex comedy. The 34-year-old comedian is set to star opposite Britain's Emily Wilson as the struggling owner of a phone sex service. Ananova reports that the film, provisionally titled Punchdrunk Love, is to be directed by Magnolia's Paul Thomas Anderson. It is billed as a \"romantic comedy.\"\n\nLaura Linney, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for You Can Count On Me, looks likely to star opposite Kevin Spacey in a new drama about capital punishment, in which the Academy Award-winning American Beauty star will play a professor who advocates the abolition of capital punishment. But when he is falsely accused and convicted of murdering Constance Harraway, his best friend and work colleague, he finds himself on death row and desperately requests that a journalist take up his case. Linney is in the frame to play Harraway, while The Hollywood Reporter says that Nicole Kidman has been offered the role of the journalist.\n\nSandra Goldbacher, the British writer-director who impressed buyers at Cannes with her second feature, Me Without You (starring Anna Friel and Kyle MacLachlan), has started work on two contemporary scripts, Faith and Utopia. Screendaily reports that Faith is a story of magic and witchcraft, while Utopia is set in a commune. Goldbacher first came to notice with her debut, The Governess."
