        "text": "Sandra Goldbacher, who also crafted the wonderful friendship film Me Without You, delivers a stunning debut with the woefully underseen and misunderstood The Governess.\n\nThe story begins with Rosina (Minnie Driver), a young sheltered Sephardic Jew, living in London under the protection of her doting father and dreaming of becoming an actress. However Rosina's plans are destroyed when her father is murdered under suspicious circumstances and her mother falls apart under the weight of his many debts. Unwilling to be married off to a fish merchant she decides to reinvent herself as a protestant governess called Mary Blackchurch and despite her hopes that she will find employment in her home city she is quickly whisked off to an isolated gothicâ€¦\n\nWhen her father dies Rosina, played by Minnie Driver leaves her Scotland home and finds work with a wealthy family as a governess.\n\nShe also catches the eye of the man of the house and they begin a passionate affair.\n\nBetter than I had expected.\n\n( 28 Days of Romance 2019 - Day 10 )\n\nI'm not really sure how to feel about this movie. The acting was fine, the camera work was good, I appreciated the male full frontal nudity vs female nudity, and I appreciated getting to see the life of Jewish people in London in the 19th century (even if it was obviously the more upper-class circle). The costumes and art direction were fine except for the dress Driver mainly wore which was distracting as hell.\n\nWhy does her dress look like leather? Why does her coat look like black latex? Am I missing something here?\n\nAlso her character's motives seem very confusing. At first they are clearly established and then they change suddenly? I suppose that was to show how impulsive she was or something but I don't really know.\n\nNot a bad movie. I'm just left kinda baffled by parts of it."
