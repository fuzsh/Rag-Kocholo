        "text": "51. Letter From President Nixon to Japanese Prime Minister Sato1\n\nSecretary Rogers spoke with you last month about developments in Cambodia. It is a topic which deeply and personally concerns me.\n\nI believe that you share my conviction that the stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia are of great importance to American and Japanese interests, and to those of all the peoples of Asia. It was heartening to learn that following an initial contribution by your Government of emergency relief supplies to Cambodia, your country is intending to improve transportation in Cambodia through the provision of $2,000,000 for trucks and other commodities. This improvement is very much needed. Japan’s efforts to meet Cambodia’s urgent requirements are a most significant beginning. Further steps will be essential.\n\nIt is my earnest hope that you will continue to be able to address yourself personally to this problem. In my view, its importance transcends the boundaries of one small and beleaguered Southeast Asian nation.\n\nSincerely,"
