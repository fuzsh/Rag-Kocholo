His party nevertheless continued to lose support. (Paragraphs 1–2.) 2. Mr Tanaka a self-made man of a type not hitherto considered appropriate to lead the party and govern Japan. (Paragraph 3.) 3. Mr Sato’s success in doubling the national income and handling student unrest. His failures over pollution and the quality of life. (Paragraphs 4–5.) 4. Foreign affairs and the reversion of Okinawa. (Paragraphs 6–8.) 5. Liberal Democratic Party contrived to maintain a large Diet majority on a minority of popular votes cast. The causes of complaint which Mr Sato failed to remedy but which his successor might be bold enough to tackle. (Paragraphs 9–11.) 6 July 1972 Mr Eisaku Sato has resigned as President of the Liberal Democratic Party and Prime Minister of Japan after seven years and eight months in office. At an extraordinary party conference of the LDP on 5 July, Mr Kakuei Tanaka was elected President of the party and on 6 July confirmed in the Diet as the new Prime Minister. 2. I believe that subsequent history will say of Mr Sato that in handling the factions in his party he was a traditional Japanese politician of great personal charm and consummate skill. One could say of the Japanese regime of this period, as was said, I think by Bagehot, of an earlier phase of British democ- * FEJ 1/3 – The British Chargé d’Affaires at Tokyo to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs – received 6 July 1972. 338 THE GROWING POWER OF JAPAN, 1967–1972 racy, that no one had the smallest inkling of the matter unless they recognized that government by a club was ‘a standing wonder’. Under this style of management, Japan achieved amazing economic growth with remarkably few stresses. But there was one fatal flaw: over a period of more than twenty years the Liberal Democratic Party and its lineal ancestors lost the support of the electorate at a steady rate of a little over 1 per cent per year. Mr Sato could not reverse this trend, and the members of the club reluctantly came to the conclusion that Mr Sato had to go. 3. He will be remembered as the last, but by no means the least, of a series of patrician Prime Ministers. As the younger brother of Nobusuke Kishi (Prime Minister from 1957 to 1960) and a protegé of Shigeru Yoshida (Prime Minister from 1946 to 1954), Mr Sato comfortably fitted the traditional mould of the well-to-do, well-connected, Tokyo University-educated gentleman, the only type hitherto considered appropriate to head the Liberal Democratic Party and to govern the country. The election of Mr Tanaka has put an end to this tradition, at least temporarily. Mr Tanaka is without respectable antecedents, lacking a university education, and yet enormously successful; in short, the archetypal self-made man, and one who is privately despised as a parvenu among some sections of the LDP. 4. When Mr Sato took over as Prime Minister in November 1964 he inherited from Mr Kishi and Mr Ikeda a plan to double the national income by 1970 . This grandiose plan was fulfilled and exceeded. Mr Sato also promised Japan stable growth and a massive increase in ‘social capital’ in the form of welfare, housing, parks, etc. These promises came to nothing. This was partly because of a basic lack of political will, and partly because of an understandable complacency at the continuing high rate of economic growth, which according to the laissez-faire philosophy of Japanese conservatism ought to leave social problems to solve themselves by creating prosperity for all. 5. Indeed the technique of masterly inactivity, of waiting for opinion to crystallize and seeming to be in the van of that opinion, was one of the most enduring traits of his Government. Perhaps the most outstanding example of this was his handling of student unrest which was at one time threatening to bring advanced education to a standstill. The unrest has virtually petered out – its only monument the incredibly well equipped and disciplined riot police – while violence is now confined to a lunatic fringe. As against this, however, Mr Sato failed to move fast enough on the issue of pollution and the quality of life, and a record of quiet success in overseas diplomacy was suddenly set at naught when Mr Nixon..."
