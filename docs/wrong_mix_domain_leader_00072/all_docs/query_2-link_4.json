        "text": "(1901–75). As prime minister of Japan between 1964 and 1972, Sato Eisaku presided over his country’s development as a major economic and world power. His antimilitaristic doctrine led to Japan’s signing of a key treaty to stop the global spread of nuclear weapons. It also helped ease tensions between Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Sato was awarded, with cowinner Seán MacBride, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974.\n\nSato was born on March 27, 1901, in Tabuse, Japan. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo) in 1924. Afterward, he joined the Ministry of Railways. He became the chief of its bureau of control in 1941 and vice-minister for transportation in 1948. He joined the Liberal Party in 1941 and was elected in 1949 to the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Later, Sato became a leader of the new coalition called the Liberal Democratic Party, which was formed when the Liberal and Democratic parties merged. He served as Japan’s minister of finance from 1958 to 1960. He was then director of the Science and Technology Agency from 1963 to 1964. The Diet chose him to replace Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato, who resigned because of illness, in November 1964.\n\nAs prime minister, Sato successfully pursued economic growth at home and improved relations abroad. He signed a friendship pact with South Korea in 1965. In 1969 he reached an agreement with the United States for the future return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan. The United States had held these islands since the end of World War II. The two countries also agreed to continue the Mutual Security Treaty, whereby Japan relied on the United States for its defense and allowed U.S. military bases to be stationed in Japan. The United States was to return Okinawa, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, to Japan. However, Sato faced heavy criticism within Japan for allowing U.S. military forces to remain on Okinawa. Sato also outlined a “peace policy” by which Japan agreed never to own, produce, or acquire nuclear weapons. Japan signed the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1970.\n\nSato resigned from office in June 1972, shortly after the Ryukyus were officially returned to Japan. He died on June 3, 1975, in Tokyo."
