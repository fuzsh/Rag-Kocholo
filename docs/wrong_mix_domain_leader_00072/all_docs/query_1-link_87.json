        "text": "THIS IS an historic occasion for the United States and Japan, and in particular for you, the people of the Bonin Islands.\n\nIn November of 1967, Prime Minister Sato and I reviewed the status of the Bonin Islands and agreed that the mutual security interests of Japan and the United States could be accommodated within arrangements for the return of administration of these islands to Japan. I take pleasure in the fact that these consultations have now been successfully concluded. I fully share Prime Minister Sato's view as stated in our joint communiqu√© of November 15, 1967, that the return of administrative rights over the Bonin Islands will contribute to solidifying the ties of friendship between Japan and the United States.\n\nAs you begin your new lives today once again under Japanese administration, I extend to you my best wishes for the future."
