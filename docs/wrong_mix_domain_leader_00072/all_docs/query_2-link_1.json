        "text": "Satō Eisaku (born March 27, 1901, Tabuse, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan—died June 3, 1975, Tokyo) was the prime minister of Japan between 1964 and 1972, who presided over Japan’s post-World War II reemergence as a major world power. For his policies on nuclear weapons, which led to Japan’s signing of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, he was awarded (with cowinner Sean MacBride) the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1974.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in law from Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo) in 1924, Satō joined the Ministry of Railways, becoming the chief of its bureau of control in 1941 and vice-minister for transportation in 1948. That same year he joined the Liberal Party and was elected in 1949 to the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Becoming minister of construction in 1952, he resigned his post the following year to become chief secretary of the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party was merged with the Democratic Party, Satō became one of the leading members of the new coalition called the Liberal-Democratic Party. During the late 1950s he served as minister of finance in the cabinet of his older brother and political mentor, Kishi Nobusuke. Kishi was succeeded in 1960 by Ikeda Hayato, in whose cabinet Satō also served.\n\nAfter Ikeda resigned because of ill health, the Diet in November 1964 chose Satō as his successor. As prime minister Satō presided over the continued growth of the Japanese economy and the improvement of Japanese relations with other Asian countries. Although Satō increased Japanese trade with mainland China to some extent, China distrusted his policies toward Taiwan and his support of the United States cause in the Vietnam War. In 1969 Satō reached an agreement with U.S. President Richard M. Nixon for future return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan, the removal of all nuclear weapons from the area, and the continued maintenance of the U.S.-Japanese Mutual Security Treaty. Satō came under heavy criticism for provisions in the agreement that allowed U.S. military forces to remain on Okinawa Island after its return to Japan."
