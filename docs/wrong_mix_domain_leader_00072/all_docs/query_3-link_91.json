Alexis Johnson, a career Foreign Service Officer and Japan specialist, set out to be very different from his predecessor, Professor Edwin Reischauer. Reischauer felt it necessary to fix what he perceived as a 'Broken Dialogue' (from the title of his piece in Foreign Affairs) between the U.S. and Japan in the aftermath of the 1960 Anpô struggle. In contrast Johnson came to Tokyo believing that a return to 'Quiet Diplomacy' was necessary. Where Reischauer had stressed the importance of cultural relations, Johnson stressed a more realist, government-level dialogue between the two countries coupled with an effort to foster a greater appreciation of security issues among the Japanese people.\n\nJohnson's tenure as ambassador therefore represents a compelling counterpoint to Reischauer's. This paper explores the extent to which Johnson's approach was the most appropriate for the time and whether his efforts were successful.\n\nThis paper outlines my dissertation research on U.S.-Japanese political and military relations during the tenure of Prime Minister Satô Eisaku, 1964 -1972.

Satô’s overriding concern during his premiership was the maintenance of good relations with the United States so as to bring about the reversion of Okinawa and to ensure Japan’s security in light of China’s nuclear development. Given the largely pacifist mood of the Japanese people in this period, as well as a growing anti-Americanism caused, in part, by U.S. actions in southeast Asia, this was not a simple task. This research sheds new light on Satô’s preoccupations and motivations and is based on diaries and memoirs of Satô and his closest associates, newly released official papers from the Diplomatic Record Office in Tokyo as well as material from the U.S. National Archives and the Johnson and Nixon Presidential libraries.\n\nTo an observer, Japan’s approach to nuclear weapons can appear confused and contradictory.

The only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons is variously described as a pacifist and non-nuclear nation and as a proliferation threat. These widely varied and conflicting conclusions are understandable given that conflicting messages are sent by senior figures. However Japan’s stance is in fact a coherent, if not uncomplicated, response both to its security needs and to domestic public opinion. However, the security provided by US extended nuclear deterrence underlines and enables this approach. The key policies and decisions were taken in both Washington and Tokyo between China’s first nuclear test (1964) and Japan’s ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (1976). How the United States came to offer this additional security guarantee to Japan and how Japan came to rely upon it underscore this complex stance and are crucial to understanding a longstanding and ongoing security arrangement and source of stability and security in northeast Asia."
