Top Secret; Sensitive. Wickel drafted this memorandum of conversation on November 24. The meeting took place at the White House. Two additional memoranda of conversation from the same dinner were found. According to one: “During dinner the Prime Minister noted his pleasure at the recent political success of President Park in the Republic of Korea, since he was the ʽonlyʼ leader there who could be trusted. Unfortunately, he said, none of those around him were worthy of any great trust.” (Ibid.) The other noted: “In separate dinner conversations with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Sato, the President noted the value of the experience of his visit to Japan as Vice President in 1953, and said that he hoped to have Vice President Agnew visit Japan soon. The Prime Minister agreed that this was a good idea. (Note: He did not warmly welcome this nor did he pursue the idea.)” (Ibid.)\n\nVol. XXIX, Eastern Europe, 1969-1972\n\nRomania\n\n190.

Top Secret; Sensitive. Sent for action. No drafting information appears on the memorandum. Sonnenfeldt forwarded it to Kissinger on November 19. In a covering memorandum, Sonnenfeldt commented: “The message [from Brandt] seems to be an effort to establish, from his end, the special relationship with the President. He shrewdly uses information on a message to Kosygin to do so. The letter to Kosygin, insofar as he discloses the text to us, seems rather hard-nosed for Brandt, but he clearly keeps the door open for bilateral exchanges with Moscow. The Germans seem worried that the Soviets are trying to avoid bilateral dealings (or are being driven to do so by the GDR) by pressing hard on the European Security Conference in which the GDR would take part as a full-fledged member. (The Soviets just told Scheel again that American-Canadian participation was dependent on GDR participation.) If Brandt’s letter says what he told the President, it is not likely to get a very forthcoming response from a Warsaw Pact meeting.” (Ibid.)\n\nVol. E-1, Documents on Global Issues, 1969-1972\n\nU.S. Policy Towards International Production and Trafficking in Illegal Drugs\n\n154.
