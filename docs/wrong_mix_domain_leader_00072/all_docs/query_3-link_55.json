        "text": "H-Diplo Article Review 1202\n\n7 February 2024\n\nGiulia Garbagni, “‘Better to Be a Chicken’s Head than an Ox’s Tail’: Japanese Envoy Diplomacy in the Mediation of Konfrontasi (1965),” Cold War History 23:1 (2023): 389-409\n\nhttps://hdiplo.org/to/AR1202\n\nEditor: Diane Labrosse | Commissioning Editor: Lori Maguire | Production Editor: Christopher Ball\n\nReview by Andrew Levidis, Australian National University\n\nThe decade of the 1960s was an important moment for reconfiguring Japan’s relations with southeast Asia. Politically and diplomatically, the complex arrangement of war reparations treaties which governed Japan’s post-1945 “return to Asia” had been transformed into an infrastructure of Cold War development.[1] As Japanese leaders restructured the political economy on a regional scale, they sought a new role for Japan in Asia. In so doing their attitudes were underpinned by an internationalist discourse of Japan as a civilizational bridge (kakehashi) between the First and Third worlds. One outcome of this historical intersection of high economic growth and conservative internationalism was the decision in 1965 by Japanese premier Satō Eisaku to dispatch a personal envoy to mediate an end to the Konfrontasi (1963–1966), a military campaign to block the formation of Malaysia. For this he turned to Kawashima Shōjirō, a powerbroker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\n\nKawashima epitomized a generation of postwar Japanese political leaders who profited handsomely from reparations and then development aid to southeast Asia. Yet he was much more than a “Machiavellian backroom operator” (392). Kawashima cast his mission as the realization of the ideal of postwar nonpartisan diplomacy (chōtōha gaikō) that aimed to transcend the compromises of party politics in the name of an overarching and transcendental national unity and solidarity among the national leadership. It is this episode of postwar Japanese envoy diplomacy that forms the subject of Giulia Garbagni’s thought-provoking intervention in Cold War History. At its core this is a story of back channels, diplomatic freelancers, political brokers, and party politicians who at different times in the 1960s were pivotal in Japan’s “return to Asia.”\n\nIn April and August 1965, Kawashima Shōjirō led two delegations to southeast Asia which Garbagni carefully sketches from a multilingual archive in order to uncover the “tensions, aspirations, and expectations” (389) that accompanied Japan’s unsuccessful offer of mediation. Kawashima’s missions coincided with a period of intense hegemonic competition that was galvanized by the strategic convergence between Beijing and Jakarta. Chronologically, Kawashima’s visits to Jakarta were juxtaposed between President Sukarno’s withdrawal from the UN and Indonesia’s political crisis on 30 September that replaced Sukarno with a new configuration of power centered on Major-General Suharto. Garbagni contextualizes Kawashima’s attempts at mediation within a broader geopolitical context, sketching a convincing and fresh picture of the complexities and tensions of Great Britain’s relationship to Japan. Mistrust of Japan’s offer of mediation was rife among British diplomats, who blended pointed questions over Kawashima’s relations to nationalist elites in Jakarta with a nexus of fears over the wider implications for Great Britain of Japan’s new centrality in postcolonial Asia.\n\nWritten as part of the bourgeoning historical turn in international relations, Garbagni examines Japanese offers of mediation with an unfailing eye for the hard world of Realpolitik and power politics.[2] Envoy diplomacy serves as a stand in for several different things, in particular, post-1945 Japanese “aspirations of influence and autonomy” (390). In a departure from the mainstream historiography, Garbagni contends that Japan acted as an “aspiring regional power,” (394) whose “paternalistic” (390) attitudes demonstrate the persistence of an imperial mindset and civilizational hierarchies that belies positive appraisals of Japan’s post-1945 relations with the Asian states.[3] To underpin this argument, Garbagni presents Japanese opposition to a role for Thailand’s military-led government in peace efforts as a universal claim, “aspiration to exert control over a perceived sphere of influence” (398).\n\nRe-situating Kawashima’s mission within political scientist Saadia Touval’s framework of “biased mediation,” (394) Garbagni adds an interesting level of analysis to Japan’s offer of mediation, as well as to the wider story of spatial and ideational conceptions about southeast Asia as Japan’s “constituency” (396).[4] What were the interests driving Japanese mediation? Sukarno’s Indonesia was the keystone of Japan’s system of repatriation treaties, and where Indonesia was concerned Japan was proving to be something of a truculent ally of the United States. At a simple level, Japanese premier Satō sought a expand Japan’s influence and enhance its international status. His determination to position Japan as a “reliable regional manager” (395) was seen as strategically advantageous ahead of negotiations for return of administration over Okinawa. Kawashima’s attitudes provide a useful counterpoint, highlighting his commitment to the ideal of autonomous diplomacy (jishū gaikō) with a particular emphasis on recreating, the author contends, Japan’s “lost great power role” (395).\n\nOne comes away from this work with a view that Kawashima’s mission to southeast Asia was notable only for what he failed to achieve. Garbagni herself offers an unsparing appraisal of the “incoherence” (399) and “diplomatic blunders” (405) of Japan’s mediation efforts, which were pursued in a flat-footed manner on the world stage by envoys for whom the dictates of conservative politics were foremost. It would scarcely be an exaggeration to say that Kawashima made serious missteps during his mission. Ahead of a meeting with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai on the sidelines of the tenth anniversary of the 1955 Bandung conference in Jakarta, Kawashima suggested that Japan was ready to establish relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). On another occasion, in a meeting with Malaysian leader Tunku Adal Rahman, Kawashima’s presentation of Sukarno’s vague pronouncements on ending the armed struggle were received as an “assurance,” (405) which resulted in acrimony and recrimination when Sukarno backtracked. Kawashima’s mission, Garbagni witheringly concludes, was that of a “self-interested mediator” (394).\n\nThis is a compelling and well-written account of Cold War international history. But the conclusions are not completely persuasive. For the sake of brevity I will focus on two major challenges. First, Garbagni situates Kawashima’s mission in the context of divisions in post-1945 Japanese conservative politics between so-called mainstream and anti-mainstream party politicians. Put simply, these divisions serve as placeholders, which are best understood as shorthand for political and personal rivalries of the 1950s and 1960s. Yet in terms of Japan’s foreign relations, these political fractures are less important and more fluid than the narrative allows; they demand thinking in terms of new scales and frameworks to capture reconceptualization of the “conservative imaginary” as the age of empire was ending.[5]\n\nKawashima’s two visits to Jakarta in 1965 took on a particular significance in the historical context of what Jeffry James Byrne called a “turning point” in histories of the Third World.[6] The visits took place on highly symbolic dates—tenth anniversary of the Bandung conference and Indonesian Independence Day. These choices were not coincidental. Nor was Kawashima’s commitment to the ten-principles of Bandung “predictable,” (405) or based upon nebulous aspirations. Rather, his relationship to Asia-Africa movement and decolonization is central to the motivations behind the mission to end the Konfrontasi. Kawashima’s involvement in the Asia-Africa movement was extensive. In 1962 he provided international support to the Asian Games in Jakarta, which served as a “beacon of Third worldism,” (400) and were to have led the Japanese representation to the second Asia-Africa meeting in Algiers before tensions led to the postponement (later abandonment) of the June conference. The discourse of Bandung and Asia-Africa (AA) internationalism appealed to Japanese conservatives as they reimagined a role for their post-imperial country in bridging the historical processes of decolonization and modernization. This is precisely what Kawashima meant when he spoke of Japan linking the ten principles of Bandung with “provision of development aid” (405).\n\nThroughout the 1960s, conservative politicians such as Kawashima, Kishi Nobusuke, Chiba Saburō, and Utsunomiya Tokuma were pivotal to shaping a new regional order. They also guided an analogous intellectual reconfiguration of Japan as civilizational bridge to meet the unfolding developments of Third World internationalism and Japan’s self-subordination to the US. Through the internationalist spiritual movement called Moral Re-Armament (MRA) led by American-Swiss theologian Frank Buchman and anti-Communist organizations including the Asian Peoples Anticommunist League (APACL) and the Asian Parliamentarian Union (APU), Japanese conservatives fashioned a new role for their country in mediating the “economic inequalities and racial hierarchies of the postimperial world.”[7] Japan’s mission to the Asia-Africa movement was to redirect anticolonial nationalists away from Communism and towards the idea that anti-Communism was the one true path to material and social progress. Kawashima saw his role as a personal envoy in these terms and believed that it was possible to mediate and reconcile Sukarno’s anticolonial nationalism with the anti-Communist West.\n\nOne reason for the narrative’s misreading of historical context is the conceptual framework of the article that shaped the narrative choices. The second is based upon the fact that the article was not situated within continuing historiographical debates in Japanese secondary sources.[8] This leads to a final point. Historians are taught to be circumspect and analytical; to ask hard questions of their sources; weigh up multiple claims; and be alive to power and production embodied by their sources. Not doing so risks handing power to historical agents who produced the archives, thus distorting context and events. Here the sources are taken at face value. In describing Kawashima’s negotiating style as “bulldozer diplomacy” (404) pursued in a “brazen, transactional, and risk-taking style,” (408) the narrative reproduces sotto voce the Foreign Office or its Japanese counterparts whose resentment at politicians trespassing on their prerogative is palpable.\n\nThe political theorist Cynthia Enloe writes that international politics is a personal realm where governments rely on “certain kinds of allegedly private relationships to conduct their foreign affairs.”[9] At its best, Garbagni’s synthetic work recovers the personal in the relationship between history and IR. On its own merits, the work is an important intervention on Japanese informal diplomacy that is made at the intersection of international history and decolonization. It is a story that deserves to be widely read and is also a story ripe for retelling."
