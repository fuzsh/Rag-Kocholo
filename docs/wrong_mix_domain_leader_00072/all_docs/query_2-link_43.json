        "text": "Fintan Hoey is a historian of modern Japan and of U.S.-Japanese relations, with research interests in nuclear proliferation, the Cold War in Asia and American diplomatic history.\n\nHis research monograph, Satō, America and the Cold War on U.S.-Japanese diplomatic and security relations during the tenure of Satō Eisaku, Prime Minister of Japan, 1964-1972, was published in 2015. This draws on recently released material from the Japanese Foreign Ministry Archive as well as US archival material and Satō’s diary. The book, the first major study in English, argues that Satō’s foreign policy was not motivated by a slavish adherence to Washington but from a realist appraisal of Japan’s security imperatives.\n\nMore recently his research has focused on nuclear proliferation, particularly Japan’s role in the emergence of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its attempts to secure full freedom of action in its pursuit of nuclear power technology. He is a member of several global research collaborations including, the Nuclear Proliferation International History Project, the Nuclear Diplomacies collaboration of diplomatic historians and historians of science, and the Constitutional History of the NPT, a project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York which will provide expert briefings to the Treaty’s Review Conference.\n\nIn 2019 he was an SNF-funded fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington DC. He has held research appointments at Kyoto University and Rikkyo University, Tokyo and teaching appointments at Queen’s University Belfast and Maynooth University, Ireland.\n\nIn addition to teaching courses related to his research interests, his wider teaching interests include modern France, modern Ireland and the British empire. He is the co-founder and director of the Minor in Postcolonial Studies.\n\n2023-2024 Courses\n\nHIS 100 Western Civilization I: Ancient and Medieval FALL 2023 This survey course is an introduction to the political, economic, social, and intellectual history of the west from the Neolithic to the voyages of discovery in the sixteenth century. Our knowledge and understanding of the past is contingent and contested. The course explores areas of contestation to give students a better understanding of the forces and events which shaped the ancient and medieval worlds and continue to shape the modern world. (It is recommended that HIS 100 be taken prior to HIS 101.) HIS 257 Early Modern Europe and the European World c.1500-1800 FALL 2023 In a relatively short period from 1500 to 1800, Europe was completely transformed and in turn transformed the world during the first major period of globalization. This course considers the changing economic and social conditions for the majority of Europe's population. It also explores how the religious and intellectual unity of the West was shattered under the weight of new ideas of church reformation and spiritual renewal and later by a revolution which asserted the Rights of Man. It analyzes how modern methods of rationalized administration changed governance, and finally how the new European states built global empires of conquest, confession and commerce. HIS 101 Western Civilization II: Modern SPRING 2024 This survey course is an introduction to the political, economic, social, and intellectual history of the west from the scientific revolution to the present. Our knowledge and understanding of the past is contingent and contested. The course explores areas of contestation to give students a better understanding of the forces and events which have shaped the modern world. HIS 268T History of Modern Japan SPRING 2024 Following over two centuries of self imposed isolation, Japan was forcibly opened to the west in the 1850s by America's 'black ships'. Since then it has experienced revolutionary changes as its leaders struggled to align Japan with the prevailing trends of the world system. These efforts have had far reaching and lasting consequences for the Japanese people and for Japan's neighbors. This course examines these changes as Japan struggled to catch up with the western powers, to industrialize, build modern systems of administration, establish itself as an imperial power, and later, to recover from the ravages of war and meet the challenges of economic success and stagnation and the ever present danger of natural disaster. This Academic Travel course includes a period of field-research throughout Japan. NOTE: This Academic Travel course carries a supplemental fee: CHF 1500 (for students invoiced in CHF) or USD 1765 (for students invoiced in USD) NOTE: This Academic Travel course will only run with a minimal enrollment of 22 students HIS 310W The Cold War SPRING 2024 The Cold War was many things. It was primarily a global power struggle between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, two Superpowers which divided the world into competing alliances and engaged in proxy wars. It was a tense and often unstable nuclear standoff. It was also an ideological clash between freedom and totalitarianism; between economic equality and exploitation; and between imperialism and anti-colonial nationalism. This course examines these intersecting facets as well as the ways in which the Cold War is interpreted and its profound and continuing impact not only on the principal protagonists but on all of the peoples of the world. (This writing-intensive course counts towards the Academic Writing requirements.)\n\nPublications:\n\nBooks:\n\nSatō, America and the Cold War. US-Japanese Relations, 1964-1972.
