        "text": "<%=company1%> (Murray Hill, NJ) signed a strategic and preferred supplier agreement with Tele1 Europe, a Nordic competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), for the deployment of a pan-Nordic, high-speed, broadband access network. The frame agreement is worth between US$29.2 - 70 million over the next three years.\n\nTele1 will be able to deliver broadband services to its business customers in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. The network construction starts in January 2000 and is expected to be completed in three years.\n\nLucent will supply its WaveStar dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM) products for Tele1 Europe's backbone transport network. The products will enable service providers to simultaneously transmit information across multiple wavelengths of light so carriers can increase network capacity without having to incur the cost of laying new fiber. In addition, Lucent will also provide support 24-hours a day, seven days a week using NetCare Professional Services offerings and network management systems."
