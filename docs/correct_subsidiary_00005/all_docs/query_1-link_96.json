        "text": "ITC^DeltaCom, a provider of integrated communications services, has completed the deployment of Alcatel-Lucent’s next-generation multiplexers as part of its long haul SONET ring network upgrade.\n\nDeltacom has also completed Metro SONET ring expansions across several markets in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Alabama and Georgia with expectations to complete several others by the end of 2009.\n\nDeltacom’s deployment of Alcatel-Lucent’s 1665 data multiplexer ethernet-over-SONEThybrid ethernet, SONET and SAN platform currently enables DS-3 to OC-192 SONET protected on- and off-ramps between Deltacom’s long haul and metro networks and its DWDM backbone.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent said that the SONET ring infrastructure supports traditional private line, transport for ethernet private line, and ethernet packet ring services delivered to Deltacom’s business and enterprise customers and to its interstate FiberNet wholesale customers.\n\nIn addition to the Alcatel-Lucent 1665 DMX, Deltacom will deploy the Alcatel-Lucent optical integrated network controller for integrated, multi-vendor network management capabilities, including security, fault, performance, and configuration management. Alcatel-Lucent will also provide maintenance on the equipment.\n\nJim O’Brien, executive vice president of operations for Deltacom, said: The Alcatel-Lucent solution offers a growth platform as we continue to augment our network infrastructure to provide SONET protected services in our expanding Southeast footprint. Customers across all of our business segments will benefit from the increased service availability and greater on-net reach."
