        "text": "Seeking to become a larger player in the carrier-class telecommunications equipment market, Alcatel SA said it would buy Newbridge Networks Inc. in a stock deal valued at $7.1 billion.\n\nThe acquisition will immediately make Alcatel a rival to Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. in the market for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) equipment.\n\nNewbridge Networks holds approximately 25% of the ATM market, Alcatel said.\n\nThe deal is part of a major restructuring in the telecommunications industry, said Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst in Marietta, Ga.\n\n“In five years, we won’t recognize the industry or the players,” Kagan said. “They are all scrambling to expand their size, scope, footprint, reach, core competencies and customer base in order to be everything to everyone, no matter where they are on the globe. This (acquisition) helps position (Alcatel) to do that.”\n\nMichael Neiberg, an analyst at Chase H&Q in New York, said the merger helps Alcatel keep pace with Cisco, which bought StrataCom Inc., and Lucent, which acquired Ascend Communications. StrataCom and Ascend are Newbridge competitors.\n\nThe merged company will have the necessary size to compete, said Neiberg. And Newbridge will benefit from Alcatel’s experience in turning around companies.\n\nAfter the merger, Paris-based Alcatel plans to create a Carrier Internetworking Division based at Newbridge’s headquarters in Kanata, Ontario. The division will consist of Newbridge Networks and Alcatel’s Carrier Data Division, which includes the company’s Assymetric Digital Subscriber Line, IP and Internet-related equipment divisions.\n\nAlcatel said acquiring Newbridge will help it get into the market for high-bandwidth data networking equipment for telecommunications carriers faster than it could by developing its own products."
