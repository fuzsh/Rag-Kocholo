        "text": "Facing even bigger rivals than before, Cisco Systems is getting ready to introduce a fast system for routing all kinds of traffic over a single network.\n\nThe world's largest computer-network hardware vendor said its new system, based on a device called the Virtual Switch Controller, will let communications carriers send voice, video, and data traffic through public or private networks. The company plans to begin marketing the service to Internet service providers, telcos, and big companies in about two months.\n\nCisco's (CSCO) disclosure of its latest product launch comes less than two weeks after its biggest rival, Lucent Technologies, agreed to acquire another rival, Ascend Communications. Some saw Cisco's product plans as a mild response.\n\n\"As a comeback to Lucent buying Ascend, it doesn't sound like much of a cap gun,\" said Steve Kelly, vice president and co-founder of Castle Networks, a start-up that develops switching technology for voice and data traffic. \"It telegraphs the message that, 'Clearly, we're not going to join these guys.'\"\n\nCisco and Lucent are racing to create a single networking device that can route computer data, telephone calls, and video through global telecommunications networks. Ascend (ASND), which Lucent is buying for about US$20 billion, specializes in routers and carrier-class switches for large corporate and public telecom networks.\n\nBesides Lucent, Cisco faces a host of other competitors looking to build new voice-and-data networks, including Siemens, Nortel Networks, and Ericsson. A number of start-ups are developing technology in the field, too.\n\nTechnical details of the new system are so far scant, and Cisco officials said the company is still working on beta versions of the new system. But a spokesman said the new routing architecture will be far faster than previous incarnations. It even will be fast enough to handle traffic on a traditional telephone network.\n\n\"My guess is that this isn't even the beginning of the Cisco response to Lucent buying Ascend,\" Kelly said.\n\nIt’s Shockingly Easy to Buy Off-Brand Ozempic Online, Even if You Don’t Need It\n\nWeight-loss drugs like Ozempic are in shortage, and telehealth startups are selling “compounded” versions. A WIRED investigation looks at how easy it is to order these meds online.\n\nHospitals Around the World Are Struggling in the Aftermath of the Great IT Meltdown\n\nDoctors find themselves without critical systems and diagnostic tools—and face the daunting reality that a full recovery could take days—after CrowdStrike’s botched deployment of a software update.\n\nIt Will Soon Be Easier for Americans to Recycle Batteries\n\nImproperly discarded batteries leak toxic chemicals and are prone to exploding. A new program funded by the Department of Energy will prop up battery drop-off sites across the US.\n\nParis Mayor Defies Poop Threats to Swim in Seine, and Prove a Point\n\nFrench politicians’ pledge to make swimming possible in the iconic river is a way to ward off criticism about the cost of the cleanup operation."
