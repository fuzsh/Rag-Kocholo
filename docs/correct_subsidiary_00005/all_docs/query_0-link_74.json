        "text": "CHELMSFORD – There was a time when it appeared Sycamore Networks Inc. would become the region’s next Wang Laboratories, employing thousands of people and generating annual revenues of billions of dollars. But the late 1990s telecom boom went bust, and Sycamore’s decade of stagnant to declining sales will soon come to a close.\n\nOfficials from the onetime high-flying Internet-equipment company announced Tuesday that they will wind down Sycamore’s operations after selling its bandwidthmanagement unit to a private investment company for $18.75 million. “After careful consideration of the company’s strategic alternatives, we believe these actions are in the best interests of Sycamore’s stockholders, as well as its customers and employees,” President and CEO Dan Smith said in a statement. Sycamore’s hardware business is being sold to a subsidiary of Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Marlin Equity Partners, an action that requires shareholder approval. In the company statement, Sycamore indicated that Marlin has agreed to offer employment to “substantially all” affected employees and that the sale is expected to be finalized sometime during the first quarter of 2013.\n\nHowever, Sycamore also plans to divest a software unit, called IQstream, through either sale or closure. An undisclosed number of employees affiliated with that division are being laid off.\n\nA spokesman for the company, Scott Larson, said in an email that Sycamore wasn’t commenting further. The company reports employing 250 employees worldwide, as of an SEC filing made on July 31. It’s unclear how many of those are at the headquarters on Mill Road in Chelmsford.\n\nChelmsford Town manager Paul Cohen said the town hasn’t heard anything from the company in regards to its future plans.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” he said. “It’s always disappointing when a company leaves town. We’ll just have to see what happens these next few weeks.”\n\nIndeed, for many, the news is seen as shocking for a company that just a dozen years ago was a star of the telecommunications boom.\n\nSycamore was co-founded in 1998 by the “Desh and Dan” team of Gururaj “Desh” Deshpande and Smith. This same pair had already made themselves (and their investors) a fortune with the $3.7 billion sale of Westfordbased Cascade Communications Inc. to Ascend Communications Inc. in 1997 (Ascend was later sold to Lucent Technologies).\n\nInvestors took an immediate liking to Sycamore shares after the company went public in October 1999. Reflecting the jubilance associated with the stock market in general, and telecommunications startups in particular, Sycamore within months boasted a market cap of $18 billion (it’s now about $170 million), briefly making Andover resident Deshpande a billionaire.\n\nShares of Sycamore shot up to a split-adjusted price of $275 per share in the spring of 2000, as enthusiasm for technology stocks reached a fever pitch.\n\nSycamore was growing so rapidly at first that it planned to buy a parcel of land off Route 3 in Tyngsboro to build a new campus housing more than 1,000 employees.\n\nBut after the Internet boom went bust, those plans were shelved.\n\nAs recently as fiscal 2008, Sycamore reported annual revenues of $115 million, although it still posted a small loss. The company was hit hard by the recession that began late that year, and saw its sales plummet to $67.3 million in fiscal 2009, with a net loss of $53.5 million.\n\nFor its most recent fiscal year, which ended July 31, Sycamore reported a net loss of $12.9 million on revenues of $57.2 million.\n\nThroughout the past decade, Sycamore did have in its favor huge cash holdings. But as it failed to generate higher sales, or consistent profits, it resorted to offering shareholders special one-time dividends, including one for a whopping $10 per share earlier this month. On Tuesday it declared another one-time dividend, for $2 per share, payable on Nov. 12 to shareholders of record on Nov. 2.\n\nAfter growing to more than 30,000 employees and seeing its annual revenues peak to $3 billion during the 1980s, the former Wang Labs went bankrupt in 1992. It reorganized and was eventually sold to a Dutch firm, Getronics, in 1999.\n\nDespite its hot start, Sycamore never reached that scale.\n\n“It’s been quite a turnaround in the past 10 years,” Cohen said.\n\nCo-founder Deshpande is a strong advocate of innovation and entrepreneurship. His nonprofit foundation is among several entities behind the Merrimack Valley Sandbox, which is aimed at helping the region make the leap from industrial city to a city at the forefront of entrepreneurship.\n\nDeshpande is also chairman of Waltham-based A123 Systems Inc., a maker of lithium-ion batteries used in automobiles and grid systems. Last week, that company filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nShares of Sycamore closed Wednesday at $5.67, down 31 cents, in Nasdaq trading.\n\nFollow Dan O’Brien on Twitter at dobrien_thesun."
