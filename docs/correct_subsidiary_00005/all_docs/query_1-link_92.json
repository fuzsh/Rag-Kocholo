        "text": "The negotiations launched by Lucent to acquire control or ownership in Metalink of Israel which develops chips enabling the broadening of the band on the copper infrastructure of telephony companies using various DSL technologies, is not surprising. All the world's major communications manufacturers, and Lucent today is held to be the biggest of them all, are in a whirl of acquisitions in order to adopt technologies that will enable them to provide as complete a solution as possible to as many customers as possible. That is the name of the game today.\n\nAll of them - Lucent, Cisco, Alcatel, Nortel and Siemens, claim that they already have a complete solution, and all are acquiring non-stop, with Israel constituting one of the main targets for the purpose of such acquisitions. It seems that Israeli technology companies increase their size and upgrade themselves like a flock of geese, in order to meet the needs of the communications giants. Not that there is much of a choice. It is far harder to compete against them and much easier to drown in the sea of money they offer.\n\nThe three Israeli DSL companies are considered world leaders in this field, and today they are ripe for sale. Infineon, a subsidiary of Siemens, last week acquired Savan of Israel for $147 million.\n\nThe chips company of Orckit, which is evidently due to be formed this week under the name Silicon Value, is also on the sights of various companies for acquisition purposes. Tomorrow, Alcatel is due to declare a material deal, and rumor has it that this concerns the chips company of Orckit.\n\nGlobes learns that it is apparently not going to happen this time, and that Alcatel is about to announce an acquisition from Canadian DSL company Metal (???). The third company, Metalink, is, as stated, in touch with Siemens.\n\nIf Lucent does in fact purchase Metalink, then this deal will be one more in a series acquisitions already made by Lucent in Israel. The first of them was the 10% investment in Chip Express, by the micro-elecronics division which is in contact with Metalink. The second was the purchase of Lannet, from Madge of Holland, which previously acquired it from the RAD group. The third was the purchase of wireless access company Web Access.\n\nLucent's presence in Israel is not expressed merely in acquisitions. The company has for some years been selling equipment in Israel, ever since it was set up after being separated from AT&T in 1995. It sells Lannet's brands here through Bynet, sells ATM switches through Telrad (through Ascend which it purchased), and won a tender for setting up the public ATM system of Bezeq, which is shortly due to be inaugurated. It sells microelectronics products through Vectronix and co-operates closely with companies such as ECI Telecom and Nice Systems.\n\nThis January, Lucent set up Lucent Israel, headed today by Shemil Levy, who manages the activity of the former Lannet. Next September, Lucent is due to make a spin-off of its entire organisations and data communications division, including Lannet, and issue it on the stock exchange. At that time, Lucent Israel will become to all intents and purposes a marketing company, headed by Ronny Bar-Orr.\n\nLucent's principal current activity in Israel is dealing with communications infrastructure tenders issued by bodies wishing to compete with Bezeq - Tevel Telecom of th cable companies, Ofek of the Eurocom group and Cellcom. Winning one or more of these tenders will, one may reasonably assume, lead Lucent to further deepen its presence in Israel."
