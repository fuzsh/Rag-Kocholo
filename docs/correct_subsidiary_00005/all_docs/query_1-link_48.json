        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started?\n\nSo the backstory as an entrepreneur probably begins early in my career when I was focusing on computer networking, and even before that in college, where I focused on math and physics. And then when I started working, I began in the computer networking field and it was very early in the technology at that point. I worked at Digital Equipment Corporation on the East Coast working on DECnet, a suite of network protocols, and then moved to Intel Corporation on the West Coast, where I was responsible for creating the national and international specification standards of the ethernet. Eventually I launched Ascend Communications, which I started with founders in 1989.\n\nWhat was the “Aha Moment” that led to the idea for your current company? Can you share that story with us?\n\nThe moment that led to the AHA was literally the Board of Directors… we were plowing along and we were about a $15 or $16 million company with a communications product that is utilized inside of a video rooms. They did not have Zoom and things back then, and the board decided that they’re just going to sell the company for about 30 million, about two times our revenues. And it just so happened coincidentally that that was double their investment in Ascend, which was by agreement. They took out two times before anybody shared, so in essence, all of the employees and founders would get zero. So we were in a bind. I talked to the Board and after heated discussions, we got a stay of execution of six months and we went through a process that I called the Sunflower Code, which I was inventing on the fly, which was a collaborative innovation process that involved the innovation, the walkabout, and finally the execution. And that process led us to the internet infrastructure world where we had the AHA moment that our core technologies could solve a lot, if not all of the problems that were holding back the spread of the internet. Most of the internet back in the early 1990s was in blackout mode. They were in bankruptcy or soon to be bankruptcy, or they were being sued.\n\nWas I a natural born entrepreneur or did you develop that aptitude?\n\nI think the answer is a little bit of both. I’d been entrepreneurial since grade school in running little businesses. I had always been entrepreneurial within larger corporations and leading major efforts such as DECnet and ethernet. And even before that, the high-speed modem project, which was the only way the internet talked in the early days, via the V 32 modem. So the V 32 work and the ethernet work on its own would’ve been tremendous accolades. The DECnet work while at Digital Equipment Corporation created the first distributed routing algorithms, which are still used today. So all of that led me to believe that at some point in time I would become an entrepreneur. The actual event that caused that was a firing of me and a blackballing of me in Silicon Valley, forcing me into a situation where I had no choice but to become an entrepreneur.\n\nWas there somebody in your life who inspired or helped you?\n\nYes, my wife Terry was the inspiration during the bleak times, such as the blackballing. She supported me financially or us financially, but also mentally. She kept saying that I could show them and beat them on the street. Ultimately, I did exactly that. The company that had fired me and the individual that had fired me, later on, realized that he had let go of me and I had grown something that was hundreds of times bigger than his company.\n\nWhat do you think makes your company stand out?\n\nWell, Ascend was 1989 through 1999, and Ascend built the infrastructure for the worldwide modern internet. So without Ascend, there was no internet. That story is being told in a movie called The Man Who Saved The Internet With A Sunflower, which is currently working its way in and around the film festival circuit.\n\nYou are a successful business leader. Which three character traits do you think were most instrumental to your success? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nInstrumental? I think humility, laughter, being able to laugh at yourself, and integrity. Those are some of the traits that I think are important in approaching life. Humility allows others to see that you’re human. It also allows you to realize that you should be open always to ideas and that you don’t have all the answers. Laughter diffuses situations in a world in which it seems that most of the people want to create tensions rather than diffuse things. And finally, integrity. Without integrity, there’s no trust. Without trust, there’s no ability to do anything.\n\nOften leaders are asked to share the best advice they received. But let’s reverse the question. Can you share a story about advice you’ve received that you now wish you never followed?\n\nInteresting, I’ve always made up my own mind on everything in the world, so my critical thinking abilities are pretty exceptional. I’m trained as a mathematician and logician. I also really value reading and analyzing and doing things in a thoughtful way. So I’ve not really followed any poor, poor advice. I’ve ignored it or I’ve challenged it.\n\nWhich tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them create a work culture in which employees thrive and do not “burn out” or get overwhelmed?\n\nI think my ‘Sunflower Code’ creates that kind of culture. It creates collaboration, first of all. So you take people- they’re collaborating on some form of innovation. It could be product innovation, it could be process innovation, and they’re collaborating in a democratic way, in a respectful way. Once you do that and they then in turn see the process all the way through testing the ideas out on accounts, and finally executing. If it gets to that stage, life in the world of your company or business is a lot more interesting, if you feel you’re part of the decision making and you’re being challenged to be innovative and creative.\n\nWhat are the most common mistakes you have seen CEOs & founders make when they start a business? What can be done to avoid those errors?\n\nWell, I think one of the single biggest common mistakes that has been made over all the years that I’ve been involved in entrepreneurship is it’s very easy to spend money. It’s very hard to make money to be profitable. So many startups today confuse raising a lot of money with having actually built a company. They haven’t. To me, you built a company that is a profitable entity that is a consistent entity, meaning quarter by quarter, it’s profitable and increasing and that’s hard. Plus to me, you take on challenging things to do and you’ve accomplished them in a profitable way, just taking money and spending money. Any fool can spend money. It takes quite a good CEO to spend very little money and produce lots of money. At the same time, you create a culture that is focused on performance and is proud.\n\nOk fantastic. Thank you for those excellent insights. Let’s now shift to the main focus of our interview about How to Successfully Ride The Emotional Highs & Lows Of Being An Entrepreneur. The journey of an entrepreneur is never easy, and is filled with challenges, failures, setbacks, as well as joys, thrills and celebrations. This might be intuitive, but I think it will be very useful to specifically articulate it. Can you describe to our readers why no matter how successful you are as an entrepreneur, you will always have fairly dramatic highs and lows? Particularly, can you help explain why this is different from someone with a “regular job”?\n\nSo in my career, my regular jobs had highs and lows because I was attempting to do great things inside of those companies — building the first high-speed modem, the first commercial ethernet, the first international standards, and the first distributed set of algorithms. So I was always trying to focus on the state-of-the-art project. When you’re in a startup mode, first and foremost, you’re working with other people. So at least 70% of the battle is the collaboration with people. If that collaboration is productive and it’s focused on performance, innovation, and execution, then that workspace is going to be a good workspace. It also should be focused on fairness and consistency, meaning what you do for one, you do for others. You would never do for one and not do for others or said in a different way is, if you’ve created a model of how you’re paying and then you break that model for one person, you’ve just sunk the ship, and people do that all the time. The highs and lows are going to occur by accomplishing a mission or set of goals, not by the tension constructed by interactions with the board whose goals may not be completely aligned with yours and your team. So you’re always going to be riding the ups and downs. In my own career, there were monstrous ups and downs. They were more like the valleys of Death Valley up to Mount Everest. Probably over the course of my leadership, there were probably 10 or 12 times the board was in the process of firing me as CEO, and yet in the end, Ascend built the worldwide internet. It was sold for $25 billion in the 1990s, the largest in the history of the United States for a venture back until recently. So you’re going to have the ups and downs, and if you can’t ride that rollercoaster or can’t push your way through that, then you don’t belong in the kitchen.\n\nI mean, I’ve gone over briefly one of the low periods in a sense where the board expected to terminate us by selling us for $30 million to a modem manufacturer. After all the years of building stuff and having a company that was say $16 million and profitable, we didn’t have the chance to actually benefit any of the employees. That was kind of a low period. The high was after we hammered out a truce with the board, and I can go into that in the interview, but suffice to say it was not an easy experience. We then went on to build the internet, grow the company in exponential form, and that was very satisfying. It was very satisfying also to see people in and around my neighborhood, or anybody that knew about Ascend, was gobbling up Ascend shares, and they were very proud to own them, and it changed their lives. They put a roof on their house, their daughter through college or whatever, and I would get all of these stories. So that’s kind of rewarding.\n\nWhat are your “Five Things You Need To Successfully Ride The Emotional Highs & Lows Of Being An Entrepreneur”?\n\nOne is you need a partner, you need a strong spouse who is with you. I think that’s essential. If your partner is pulling in a different direction then it’s going to be close to impossible. So number one is my wife.\n\nNumber two is a moral compass, a set of values for me. Things are very black and white. There are no intermediate colors, so I don’t really struggle with things that other people have a lot of struggle for because I’m not fearful that you’ll walk out or three people will quit or whatever. If they wanted to quit, that exit door was always there. I’d rather have the 10 people that were really with me than the 25 people, 15 of whom were threatening things.\n\nThe other characteristics are a connection with people and a humility. If you have a connection with people, then everybody is riding the waves together. And if you share information with the whole company, including how well it’s doing or not doing, then we’re all in the same boat together. And another factor is if you show by your actions what you want from people in terms of your work habits, your ethics, then that spreads.\n\nWe are living during challenging times and resilience is critical during times like these. How would you define resilience? What do you believe are the characteristics or traits of resilient people?\n\nI mean, resilience to me is you’re going to be faced with blows. You’re going to be faced with ups and downs. You’re able to integrate them over time, realizing that the low dark day will be followed by sun. The incredibly sunny days might be followed by some dark days. So you do not get overly excited by the sunny, sunny or overly depressed by the dark, dark. You have a confidence in you and your people that you’re headed in the right direction. Things are moving in the right direction and in time you will succeed.\n\nIn your opinion, do you tend to keep a positive attitude during difficult situations? What helps you to do so?\n\nYeah, I do keep a positive attitude towards difficult situations.\n\nKeep a positive attitude. I also had measurable performance goals that we built for the company, and we took them very seriously. They weren’t suggestions. They were built collaboratively with the teams. And the environment was such that I’m trusting you as an adult. I’m interacting with you as an adult. You’re building goals, measurables, and we better do them. We’re not making a suggestion that you should do them. If you don’t follow that, then the exit sign is appropriate because it is much better to have a very, very lean company with people that are all synchronized as to how the culture is. So to me, I was always attempting to spend as little money as possible on myself and others in the highest performing culture that was accomplished. Ascend was the highest in measurements of revenues per employee and performance. Profits per employee were off the charts. In fact, they were number one, and that’s indicative of the type of culture it was. We’re not trying to spend a lot of money, but the money that we spent brought in lots of money and people were focused on success in the business space.\n\nCan you help articulate why a leader’s positive attitude can have a positive impact both on their clients and their team?\n\nI think instead of reverting to a happy smile in the form of positive, I think what you really have to do is share and collaborate with people. A set of what we termed, and I termed King of Milestones, king of basically is what does the company want to be king or queen of. And what does it mean to be king of; what does it mean to the marketing department, the sales department, the engineering, manufacturing and so on? And when you hammer that out and you have literally on a set of whiteboards, your king of plan for a company, and that’s been collaborated with lots of people in the company, then what you have is a pretty positive culture. It’s positive because it gives a clear set of guidelines and framework for people to operate. It’s positive in the sense of what is expected of you and what is demanded of you is well known. And to me, cultures and Ascend’s culture thrived on people who wanted to be winners. They want to actually accomplish something in life that they’re proud of and they’d like to make some money doing that.\n\nYou can do all three, but it’s not a goody two shoes kind of thing. It’s setting up some king of plan, which I can go into detail with you over the course of the interview. And then executing that king of with all the employees and with the board, you literally report or the employees report to the board on how well it’s executed. So each of my management heads would report to the Board on their set of king of goals and how well they’re doing. That was kind of great for the Board and the employees got exposed to the Board. And so again, it’s open and collaborative, even with the Board.\n\nOk. Super. We are nearly done. What is your favorite inspirational quote that motivates you to pursue greatness? Can you share a story about how it was relevant to you in your own life?\n\nI think that there are a lot of things that impact my thinking and my entrepreneurship and my life. But I think if you go back to Churchill, at the beginning of World War II, there were quotes, and he is quite quotable, and I am not memorizing all of them, but there were very many quotes on basically the grit that he expected from the nation, great Britain, the UK, under the evil forces that were being applied to them, Germany and the Nazi regime, and how he expected to never quit. And I think he used the word never many times, never, never, never quit. I think people quit. They don’t have a good framework of what they’re doing. They haven’t thought things through. Their leadership is not that collaborative and not that smart, and they quit. And so I feel that didn’t apply specifically to me. I’m not going to quit.\n\nI’m going to be still standing. You’re really going to have to beat me. I’m not going to beat myself. And I think anytime you do that, you’re upholding yourself, first of all, because you are a winner in your own eyes. And other people realize to stand tall. It becomes an emotional connection and something great that they’re doing. Then it’s not just a workplace then it’s not just a, oh, I want to work from home. I don’t want to work there. You’ll want to work there because you’re emotionally connected and you’re involved and you’re not going to be involved sitting in your closet or your bedroom dialing in.\n\nHow can our readers further follow you online?\n\nWebsite: https://www.themenwhosavetheintrenet.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555943720821\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/themanwhosavedtheinternetfilm\n\nThe film’s official trailer: https://youtu.be/Qt3vI07hWx0?si=6Ut7vpM2HEA1aEec\n\nThis was very inspiring.
