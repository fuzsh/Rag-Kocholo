        "text": "Shareholders filed four lawsuits against Ascend Communications, charging that the company shortchanged them when it accepted a takeover offer from Lucent Technologies valued at about US$20 billion.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed in Delaware's Chancery Court, accuse Ascend's directors of breaching their fiduciary duty and failing to maximize shareholder value by agreeing to a Lucent (LU) acquisition.\n\nLucent said Wednesday it agreed to buy Ascend (ASND), ending months of speculation about a possible agreement. Ascend, based in Alameda, California, makes routers and switches to send information over global computer networks. Lucent, based in Murray Hill, New Jersey, is the largest maker of telecom equipment.\n\nShareholders filed the lawsuits almost immediately after the companies announced the planned acquisition. Such suits are common in takeover situations and have been on the rise in recent years as the pace of large-scale corporate mergers accelerates.\n\nIn addition to the Delaware suits, Ascend is also facing charges from a 1997 shareholder class action. In that case, investors who bought Ascend shares between November 1996 and September 1997 are charging that the company misled investors regarding the moneymaking potential of new modems it had developed. The case is pending before US District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles."
