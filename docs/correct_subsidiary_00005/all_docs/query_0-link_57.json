The agreement enables Mitsubishi to further broaden its leadership in serving the carrier market by providing its customers with the industry's most scalable, reliable and open Voice-Over-Packet solutions. The Sonus GSX9000 and the Sonus Open Services ArchitectureTM (OSA) will enable Mitsubishi's carrier customers to rapidly develop and deliver competitive new customer services, fueling important new revenue streams.\n\nHajime Kimura, Division COO of Mitsubishi Corporation's Information Systems & Services Div.A, noted: \"We have selected Sonus Networks as our distribution partner based on their unique ability to enable our customers to realize the promise of IP Telephony.
