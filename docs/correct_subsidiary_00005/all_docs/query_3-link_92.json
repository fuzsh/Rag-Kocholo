        "text": "Anti-Social Proof\n\nIn the words of the great Fred Wilson – “If you can’t figure out why you like an investment and why it will be successful, don’t make it”.\n\nRecently, I came across this awesome (like always!) 2012 post from Fred Wilson (Union Square Ventures) – Social Proof Is Dangerous. Quoting a line that captures its essence:\n\nIf you can’t figure out why you like an investment and why it will be successful, don’t make it.\n\nOne of the big investing ideas I have distilled from studying the best investors across asset classes – from Charlie Munger and Howard Marks to Bruce Flatt and Vinod Khosla, is that to outperform the average (the index), one has to be “non-consensus-and-right”.\n\nIn fact, in my July’23 post ‘An Investing Framework To Find Startup Diamonds‘, I outlined a Consensus vs Signal 2×2 and argued that the outlier venture returns opportunities tend to be found in the High-Signal-Non-Consensus quadrant.\n\nIt was only in 2022, almost a decade after I first started my career as an institutional VC, that I truly embarked on this journey of trying to become a non-consensus-and-right venture investor. As I have outlined in the above 2×2, molding my mindset toward this approach has required consciously working on the following 2 elements:\n\n1/ Having a unique world-view and trusting my instincts to be able to spot ‘Signal’.\n\n2/ Totally ignoring any social proof noise while doing this.\n\nI have observed that while it was really hard to ignore social proof early on in my career (eg. which VC is leading the deal), having seen so many Tier 1 VCs across geos do such foolish things over a decade, I must say with much humility that as of today, I find it much easier to ignore their POVs on something.\n\nA few months back, I also came across comprehensive LP data that validates this organic learning. David Clark of VenCap shared with Jason Calacanis how loss ratios are surprisingly similar across various percentiles of funds, and even the best strike out a lot.\n\nThat’s why in my view, it’s foolish to do one-off deals purely on the basis of the social proofing of a lead investor in that deal unless one is actually replicating their entire portfolio construction (which is a benefit only LPs in their Funds get).\n\nThis idea also explains why I remain skeptical of loose angel networks, angel communities, and syndicates that really don’t have a unique, grounds-up world-view and right-to-win, and therefore in most cases, do spray-and-pray on allocations in deals being done by VCs.\n\nThese deals often suffer from major adverse selection (“if the founder/ startup is so good, why are they raising from you?” OR “what specific value are you bringing to the table because of which a star founder is giving you allocation?”) and are therefore, likely to be on the wrong side of the loss ratios of major funds.\n\nComing back to the point of social proof, let me neatly summarize my POV on it:\n\nIf the best Tier 1 VCs are striking out as much as an average Joe VC, there is no value in blindly following them.\n\nThere could be value in investing in the “best” companies of a Tier 1 VC portfolio but especially at the seed stage, it’s impossible to know beforehand which company will turn out to be this “best” company. Also, companies keep going in and out (and back in) of this “best” bucket multiple times anyway during a Fund’s 10-year lifecycle.\n\nEven if there was a way to know which company is indeed the best company in a Tier 1 VC portfolio, why would they give me allocation in it? The best VCs want to keep every bps of ownership in their best companies only for themselves.\n\nHence, what’s the point of doing a deal purely because of social proof? I would rather spend that effort looking for the best contrarian deals in places where no one is looking, doing the work (and trusting my instincts) to spot Signal in them, and investing in them as early as possible, driven only by my strongest conviction and nothing else.\n\nThis approach is already starting to reflect in the early Operators Studio Fund 1 portfolio. In a majority of recent investments (eg. Soulside, Confido, Loop, Astrophel Aerospace, and a recent one in Stealth), I was literally the first investor to build conviction and say “yes” even before the round started coming together with other VCs. In several of these deals, I ended up catalyzing the round itself, making intros to eventual lead investors and even sharing my customer diligence notes with VCs evaluating the company.\n\nIn a way, this approach is Anti-Social proof and Pro-Signal. What is Signal, you ask? It can be of two types, as I explained in my July’23 Investing Framework post (quoting from it here):\n\nInternal – extraordinary founder-market fit eg. the founder has spent a decade just going deep in the field. Or a backstory that provides an authentic “why” behind pursuing this idea. Or an execution track record in the startup’s arc that is outstanding on important elements like capital efficiency, iteration velocity, or organic customer acquisition.\n\nExternal – eg. a visionary customer is taking a bet, partnering with them in building the early product. Or a domain expert, skilled operator, perhaps even a specific GP in a venture firm, has taken the time to evaluate & build high conviction in the company.\n\nAs you can see, there is a little bit of social proofing baked into evaluating Signal too, but it’s much more oriented around operating and execution-oriented conviction vs deal FOMO and an investing herd mindset.\n\nAs you churn on this post, here are more POVs on this topic from some really distinguished venture investors over the years (Source: a 13-year-old Quora post titled Is social proof a rational approach to investment selection?)\n\n1/ Roger Ehrenberg (Founding Partner – IA Ventures, one of the best-performing seed funds of all time)\n\n2/ Naval Ravikant (Co-founder – AngelList, one of the best angels of all time)\n\n3/ Dave McClure (Founder – 500Startups, now running PracticalVC)\n\nAdditional readings: The Death of Social Proof by Hunter Walk (Co-founder of a very successful seed VC Homebrew).\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nNotes From India Trip Q2’24 – Elections, Deeptech, Fundraising\n\nNotes from my Q2’24 India trip – everything from post-election vibes to public markets and the state of the venture ecosystem.\n\nJust returned from my quarterly trip to India. With the recently held elections (and a bit of a surprising result there!), it was interesting to get a pulse of what’s happening on the ground. Here are some key takeaways from my meetings with founders, investors, and operators in the ecosystem:\n\n1/ Real reasons behind BJP’s weakened mandate\n\nWhile Modi created a massive pre-election narrative of the BJP coming back to power with an even bigger majority than in 2019, it ended up losing ground in the actual results tally.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t see it coming but talking with people on the ground, one of the major reasons behind the weakening of BJP seems to be shrinking employment opportunities, especially for young graduates. While the India macro story stays strong, there are pockets of economic distress in the poor states and amongst the lesser-skilled parts of the population/ those graduating from non-top-tier universities.\n\nIt’s clear that while Modi focused a lot on infra buildout over the last 2 terms, one of his core focus areas in the 3rd term needs to be continuous job creation for all sections of society. This might require some bold reforms.\n\n2/ Investors are largely unperturbed by the election results\n\nGiven that the BJP-led NDA coalition still has a comfortable majority in the Parliament, and Modi continues to be the PM with a largely unchanged cabinet, Investors are expecting political and economic continuity in this 3rd term of the govt.\n\nSo, expect continued momentum on key execution tracks from the last 2 terms, including physical infrastructure buildout, expansion of digital public goods, and focus on technology startups.\n\n3/ General Catalyst acquiring Venture Highway\n\nThe news of GC acquiring VH broke out while I was in Bangalore. While it could be a one-off development, it’s still a positive greenshoot that a large Silicon Valley-based, premier capital pool is allocating to the India venture market.\n\nPersonally, I also believe it’s a smart move from Hemant Taneja to acquire a high-performing team that is local and has developed on-ground expertise, versus parachuting people in from the Bay Area or doing the fly-in-and-out model.\n\nNot recruiting and empowering a high-quality local leadership team is a classic India entry mistake that both Y Combinator and AngelList did, which is why they have struggled to crack the market.\n\n4/ All VCs talking deeptech now\n\nSimilar to the Valley, deeptech has now clearly become the flavor of the season. Even a few years back, major Indian VCs spending time at the IIT incubators or looking at sectors like manufacturing and semiconductors was unheard of. This time, I heard multiple instances of VCs writing large seed checks into deeptech companies.\n\nMy only fear is that based on past history, the Indian VC ecosystem tends to behave in steep emotional cycles, flooding hot sectors with capital in tandem like a herd (eCommerce 15 years back, fintech 10 years back, lending and SaaS 5-7 years back), and then abandoning verticals also in tandem like a herd (eg. no one is touching edtech now).\n\nThese emotional cycles are incredibly counter-productive for long-term company building, and also tend to be incredibly disturbing, especially for younger, 1st-time founders. As the deeptech wave begins, I hope some lessons are learned and implemented from previous cycles.\n\n5/ Angels suffering from 2021 vintage markdowns and illiquidity\n\nOne of my observations on the Indian venture ecosystem has been many new-gen angels tapping out in 2023/24. While some of the marquee spray-and-pray ones, as well as the conventional IAN/Mumbai Angels persona, continue to be active, many high-quality operator angels seem to have bowed out of the game.\n\nOn bringing this point up with folks, they confirmed that the portfolios of many new angels who started deploying in 2020 and 2021 are suffering from either major markdowns and writeoffs or prolonged illiquidity of marked-up positions. I would also add layoffs, salary rationalizations, and a lack of broader ESOP liquidity (barring a few cases here and there) to the list of reasons behind many angels bowing out of the game.\n\n6/ Seed capital is plenty but wants more traction. Series As continue to be hard.\n\nSimilar to the Bay Area, I heard that while there is plenty of pre-seed/seed capital available in the ecosystem right now, the bar for raising Series A has significantly gone up. As a result, companies are seeing both larger seed rounds as well as extension/ top-up rounds happening as we speak.\n\nSeveral seed investors shared with me that one of their learnings from doing many idea-stage deals in 2021 is how companies are taking so much longer than they initially estimated to go from zero to even $100k ARR. This is adversely impacting the IRRs of seed portfolios. Also, given valuations have now massively corrected, the next round markup isn’t in line with the time it’s taking to get to early traction.\n\nGiven this dynamic, many seed investors are now tracking companies and waiting to see more traction before pulling the trigger on idea-stage companies. Btw, am seeing similar behavior even in the late seed/ pre-Series A/ Series A spectrum too, where VCs are waiting to see a long enough timeline of revenue growth, retention, and other metrics before engaging seriously.\n\nAnother related observation – growth capital for tech companies is a major gap in the India venture ecosystem right now. Many strategics and hedge funds that were writing large checks post-pandemic have either completely exited the market (eg. Softbank, Alibaba, and Tencent) or are triaging their current portfolios. Recent cases like Prosus writing off its entire ~$500Mn investment in Byju’s isn’t helping to build confidence either.\n\n7/ Public markets continue to rip, lots of FO appetite for pre-IPO rounds\n\nAfter a brief blip post-election results, Indian public markets have continued to rip. There is a whole new generation of young Indians who are leveraging new-age brokerage apps like Zerodha and Groww to actively participate in the markets. In fact, recent F&O retail trading numbers suggest that a majority of this activity might in fact, be speculative rather than long-term, fundamental investing.\n\nIt is noticeable to see frequent ads on Indian TV channels encouraging everyone to invest in mutual funds. An uncle who recently visited us in SF was bragging over chai about how he “made 55 lakhs in the market already this year”.\n\nDuring this India trip, I saw my father casually opening and checking his brokerage app dashboard multiple times daily. I also noticed that a majority of YouTube consumption by this age group is financial influencer and stock tips content.\n\nOn a similar note, a few institutional investors shared how domestic Family Offices are showing an increased appetite for pre-IPO investments in companies like Lenskart, FirstCry, and Oyo. In fact, with the domestic index doing really well, FOs are more skeptical of taking LP positions in venture funds right now, preferring to either stay liquid in public markets or take relatively de-risked, later-stage positions in pre-IPO private companies.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nFederer at Dartmouth\n\nRecapping “tennis lessons” from Roger Federer’s 2024 commencement address at Dartmouth.\n\nI am a big believer in collecting mental models from various disciplines in life, and as part of that, I look to learn from top sportspersons. So I naturally found the “tennis lessons” Roger Federer shared in his recent commencement address at Dartmouth to be particularly insightful.\n\nIn addition to capturing some defining experiences and approaches from Roger’s life, the speech was also filled with some amazing one-liners. I always find these to be really useful as they help us cognitively index, remember, and recall powerful concepts that others have experientially learned.\n\nHere are some powerful ideas from the speech that stayed with me:\n\n1/ “Effortless is a myth”\n\nThe truth is, Roger had to work really hard to make it look easy. A lesson for all of us chasing excellence in our respective fields – you have to embrace hard work before you become an expert.\n\n2/ “Everybody can play well for the first 2 hours”\n\nThe real game starts after that, when the body is tired, the mind wobbly and the discipline fading. This highlights the importance of stamina, and of grit, in life.\n\n3/ “My warm-ups at the tournament were so casual, people didn’t think I was training hard. But I had been working hard…before the tournament…when nobody was watching”\n\nThe importance of prep, putting in the reps, breaking a sweat. Excellence during the most crucial moments in life is a result of all the work put in during the years prior.\n\nReminds me of the famous General Patton quote – “He who sweats more in training bleeds less in battle”.\n\n4/ “Belief in yourself has to be earned”\n\nRoger didn’t explain this thought much, but my interpretation is this – self-belief is a by-product of the work you put in to go deep into a skill, and of the chances & risks that you take to make yourself better.\n\n5/ “I beat some of the top players I really admired by aiming right at their strengths”\n\nRoger tried to beat the baseliners from the baseline, beat the attackers by attacking, and beat the net-rushers from the net. He did this to amplify his game and expand his options, preparing for scenarios where one strength breaking down could be replaced by another one.\n\n6/ “In tennis, there can be many types of talent”\n\nRoger cites some of them – grit, discipline, patience, trusting yourself, embracing the process, managing your life, managing yourself. Also mentioning that everyone has to work on these things.\n\nI would add that these are talents not just for tennis, but also for life.\n\n7/ “You can work harder than you thought and still lose”\n\nTennis is a brutal game where at the end of a tournament, only one player gets a trophy while everyone else gets on a plane, thinking “how the hell did I miss that shot?”.\n\nLife is going to be a roller-coaster for all of us. It’s how you manage and behave after losing a game, is that defines how big you will eventually win.\n\n8/ “In tennis, perfection is impossible”\n\nRoger shares some really interesting stats from his career – in the 1,526 singles matches he played, he won almost 80% of these matches. BUT he only won 54% of points across these matches. So, even the greatest of all time tennis players barely win half of all the points they play!\n\nWhy is this important? Roger says it teaches players to not dwell on previous points and to play each point on its merit. In other words, stay in the moment and play each point as if it’s the most important point in the world.\n\nPS: like me, if you love learning from sportspersons, then I highly recommend Open – Andre Agassi’s autobiography. It helped me through some of the lowest points in my life.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nThe Success Flywheel – Part 2 (Superhuman, Perplexity)\n\nFollowing up with a Part 2 of my last year’s post on ‘The Success Flywheel’ – how the journey of the Founder of Superhuman, as well as Perplexity’s cap table, shows that winners keep winning.\n\nWhile attending the recent Camp Hustle’24 (which btw, was an awesome LP-GP event; my notes from the event here), I got the opportunity to witness a candid fireside chat with Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman.\n\nI have followed Rahul’s journey for a while now. My last startup Workomo was tackling a similar problem statement to Rahul’s previous startup Rapportive. Also, his article ‘How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product Market Fit‘ from First Round Review really helped me as a 0-to-1 founder. In fact, I wrote a post on it myself in 2019 deconstructing Superhuman’s PMF playbook.\n\nListening to Rahul talk through his life journey in detail during Camp Hustle reminded me of one of my core mental models – the ‘Success Flywheel‘. I first wrote about it in a May’23 post. It essentially means that our world is wired in a way that winners keep winning.\n\nUnpacking this a bit more, I have seen that in every case, the “winner” had a clear first event of success that then kickstarted the Success Flywheel in their lives.\n\nLet’s look at Rahul Vohra’s life journey as an example (from what he shared during Camp Hustle):\n\nStarted coding at the age of 8.\n\nCompleted undergrad in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. Went on to enroll in the PhD program but dropped out.\n\nReid Hoffman (Founder of LinkedIn) was speaking at an event in Cambridge. Rahul met him and asked for one piece of advice, to which Reid responded – “move to the Bay Area”.\n\nRahul followed this advice, moved to SF, started Rapportive, and as luck would have it, got acquired by LinkedIn!\n\nAs Rahul was thinking through his next startup idea after spending a couple of years at LinkedIn, he got this golden advice from a mentor:\n\nIf you are a first-time founder, start by going after a niche market with little competition, even if it’s small in the beginning, so you can differentiate more easily.\n\nIf you are a second-time founder, go after a very large and crowded market from the very beginning, because you are likely to out-execute and out-raise competition in the space.\n\nRahul followed this advice and started building Superhuman to go after the behemoth Gmail (which…is free!). On the back of his previous success with Rapportive, Superhuman was able to get backed by top-tier VCs like a16z, First Round, and IVP, in addition to celebrity angels like Ashton Kutcher, Will Smith, and the Chainsmokers.\n\nThrough Rapportive and now Superhuman, Rahul obviously became deeply entrenched in the Valley venture ecosystem, building relationships with some of the best founders, angels, and VCs out there. Given this access, he started angel investing on the side and soon started running into Todd Goldberg (Founded Eventjoy; Acquired by Ticketmaster) on several deals.\n\nThey both connected, decided to join hands, and started Todd and Rahul’s Angel Fund. If the founding and operating success weren’t enough, check out some of the portfolio companies of this Fund – Mercury, Circle, Descript, Clearbit, and AngelList.\n\nRahul’s journey is another great example of the Success Flywheel in action – how he was able to keep parlaying his initial success into more success, and it continues.\n\nEven before his move to Silicon Valley and starting up, the initial success event that seems to have catalyzed the Flywheel in Rahul’s journey was his getting into the ultra-competitive CS undergrad course at a top-tier uni like Cambridge. Few get the opportunity to meet OGs like Reid Hoffman in person, let alone get his advice. Being part of a highly selective cohort of young students positioned him to get this sort of early exposure.\n\nAs I was ruminating on these learnings from Camp Hustle, I saw this LinkedIn post from Aravind Srinivas, Co-founder and CEO of Perplexity:\n\nBased on current vibes, Perplexity seems to have the best odds among the new generation of AI-native companies to be the “Google-killer”. If this is true, then check out who has access to the next (potential) Google – Jeff Bezos, the entire YC gang, Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Balaji Srinivasan, Tobi of Shopify, and other successful repeat founders, operators & prominent investors. It’s the same set of folks who succeeded first in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, many of whom then also benefited in Web 3.0/ Crypto.\n\nThese individuals are already at the top of the pyramid, operate at the tip of the spear of capitalism, and keep parlaying their success from one economic cycle to the next, one asset class to the next, and one technology to the next. Each of their Success Flywheels keeps ripping and getting exponentially stronger with each rep.\n\nOf course, it’s important to acknowledge the hustle, passion, and hard work that continues to grease these Flywheels. But the Flywheel nature ensures that the ROI on each ounce of input keeps compounding at an exponential pace. Then it’s a personal choice whether one eases the input-effort but still gets growing outcomes, or like Bezos and Musk, keeps growing the input-effort and given improving ROI, translates to even better outcomes with each parlay.\n\nPS: for thoughts on how to get the Success Flywheel going in your own life, check out my May’23 post ‘The Success Flywheel‘.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nTips & Insights For Emerging VC Managers – Notes From Camp Hustle’24\n\nMy notes from attending Camp Hustle, a unique LP-GP gathering. Includes actionable tips for those raising Funds 1 and 2.\n\nIt was a great experience to attend Camp Hustle last week. I have been following the work of Elizabeth Yin (co-founder of Hustle Fund, a pre-seed fund that organized this event) on X for some time now. All this while, I kept seeing posts from the last 2 editions of the event.\n\nThis time, I was in town, in a relationship-building zone, and looking to add new and interesting LP-GP folks to my community. So, I landed up at the event (who would say no to spending 2.5 days in the idyllic surroundings of Los Gatos and Saratoga anyway!).\n\nHonestly, I didn’t arrive with a specific agenda or expectations from the event. I just went in with an open mind and knowing the vibe of the Hustle Fund team, I instinctively knew this would likely be the best frame of mind for this gathering.\n\nThe event turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Now I know why the name has the word “Camp” in it – the entire event had an informal, outdoorsy, campy, yet energetic and authentic vibe to it. Everyone agreed to an informal social contract – no explicit pitching, no so-called networking and no shallow talk. Everyone bought into the idea of just getting to know a bunch of folks and really bringing their whole, authentic selves to the event.\n\nWhile the free-flowing, candid conversations amidst nature were the highlight of the event, I did end up with some really actionable insights shared by the Hustle Fund team, other emerging managers as well as a few LPs. Sharing my notes below:\n\n1/ Fundraising for emerging fund managers – via Charles Hudson (Precursor Ventures) and Virginie Raphael (Full Circle)\n\nWhile interacting with potential LPs, focus on making them a “fan” of the fund first. That is the first step towards eventually converting to an LP.\n\nOne common mistake during fundraising as a first-time manager is chasing people too aggressively. The key is to put out your story and let people come to you.\n\nA great way to engage potential LPs is to send out a monthly/ quarterly newsletter. Also, Virginie mentioned doing informal LP meets in the Spring and Fall, so folks stay connected with the fund.\n\nThe majority of potential LPs you meet today might eventually invest in Funds 2 and 3. So, it’s important to start building relationships from now.\n\nI asked Charles a question on ways to increase conversion on warm intros that a GP gets via existing LPs. While intuitively one might expect a healthy conversion on this type of lead, Charles confirmed that in his fundraising experience, the conversion on these referrals was indeed lower than expected.\n\n2/ Venture investing learnings from the Hustle Fund team\n\nDuring an informal AMA, Hustle Fund co-founders Elizabeth, Eric, and Shiyan shared the following top venture investing learnings from their anti-portfolio:\n\nAlways bet on your friends.\n\nDon’t penny-pinch on valuation (they passed on an initial round of one of the largest consumer Internet outcomes because of valuation).\n\n“Good deals have legs” – when you like a founder, push as hard as possible to get into the deal. Don’t be afraid of being perceived as a pain, if it can help you get into the deal.\n\nDon’t over-index on what a market or company looks like right now. Learn to imagine what the market or a company can become “over a period of time”.\n\n3/ Tips from an institutional LP\n\nCourtney McCrea (Co-founder of Recast Capital) is one of the most experienced institutional LPs out there. In a candid Bonfire Session, she shared some insightful tips for emerging managers:\n\nDuring an LP pitch, don’t be afraid to talk about how great you are. In fact, spend the first 3 minutes in a pitch just talking about your unique superpowers.\n\nIf you are having trouble creating a unique narrative for why your fund is different, ask your portfolio founders why they picked you and how they would pitch you to their friends.\n\nLPs look at who you co-invest with and who does follow-ons in your companies, as signals for the quality of your deal flow.\n\nThere are so many LPs out there who aren’t pitched very often. Try and focus on them to improve your odds. Don’t underestimate the amount of capital that is out there looking to be deployed.\n\n4/ Other helpful convos\n\nMatthew Stotts of Cerulean Ventures shared that outlining the 10-year vision and story of what the fund is looking to do, goes a long way in generating excitement as most LPs are looking not just for financial returns but also for impact in whatever their personal mission is.\n\nTo re-engage with potential LPs in your funnel, try going back to them when you have an interesting development or story to share from the portfolio (eg. “we invested in Company X at the pre-seed stage and now, 12 months later, they just cracked a $XMn ACV deal”). This could also be done with a new differentiated investment or interesting deal flow.\n\n[Via Rahul Vohra, Founder and CEO of Superhuman] One of the best pieces of advice Rahul got while building Rapportive was to pick a strategy to go from Point A to Point B, never change your mind about it, and continue relentlessly executing it. The goal could be say reaching 1Mn users, $100k MRR, or any other metric. The key is to stick with it.\n\nHope these notes help emerging managers out there. Once again, thanks so much Team Hustle Fund for creating this unique event format. Am excited for the next one!\n\nPS: For those in SE Asia, the next Camp Hustle is in Bali in September🏖️\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nLeading With Grit\n\nGrit needs not just perseverance, but also passion for a long-term goal.\n\nLoved this talk on “Leading with grit” by Angela Duckworth at the recent Norges Bank Investment Conference 2024. This is a particularly interesting topic for me given scouting gritty founders is one of the pillars of my venture strategy.\n\nSome interesting insights from this talk:\n\n1/ Definition of Grit\n\nGRIT is sustained passion and perseverance for especially long-term goals.\n\nGrit needs not just perseverance, but also passion for a long-term goal.\n\n2/ Talent & IQ has NO correlation with Grit\n\nGrit actually unlocks the latent talent of people.\n\n3/ A nuance of the 10,000-hour rule\n\nIt’s not just the quantity of practice that makes a world-class expert, it’s also the quality. High-quality practice can be called “deliberate practice”. Low-quality practice will only take you to the plateau of “arrested development”.\n\n4/ “Dropping out” can be valuable in certain cases\n\nIf you start something and with some practice, realize that you aren’t enjoying it, or that the opportunity cost is too high, or things are just not working out for some reason, it’s perfectly acceptable to drop out.\n\nEssentially, mindless grit should be avoided.\n\n5/ Three elements of deliberate practice\n\n(a) Decide on a small sub-skill to practice.\n\n(b) Practice with 100% focus (the opposite of “multi-tasking”).\n\n(c) Feedback and reflection.\n\nWhile the best at this practice alone, they also work with a coach to show them the results of their practice and get feedback.\n\n6/ The hierarchy of goals\n\nImportant to have a top-level goal that is long-term. But then, this goal should be broken down into a set of mid-level goals that in turn, are broken down into extremely tactical low-level goals with a daily/ weekly cadence.\n\nLeading with grit means being extremely stubborn with the top-level goal but highly flexible and agile with low-level goals.\n\nPS: if you found this intriguing, check out one of the all-time best TED talks by Angela on Grit.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nThe Funnel Of Doing New Stuff\n\nWhenever someone thinks of starting anything new, say a habit like working out or reading regularly, a side hustle, a passive income project, or even a full-time venture, they should expect to enter the “Funnel of Doing New Stuff”.\n\nThis past week, I launched an experiment of extending An Operator’s Blog into a podcast (I call them “jamming sessions”). Through these sessions, my idea is to discuss real operating questions and challenges faced by early-stage founders and folks in the venture ecosystem. Also, invite guests who are deep experts in their area but aren’t very visible.\n\nThe first episode is on “Doing 0-to-1 as a cybersecurity startup” where I went into brass tacks with two amazing venture-backed founders and engineering leaders in the domain – Buchi Reddy B (Founder and CEO of Levo.ai; ex-Traceable AI, ex-AppDynamics) and Ruchir Patwa (Co-founder and CEO of SydeLabs; ex-Google, ex-Mobile Premier League).\n\nIf there is one thing I learned from my past experience as a founder, it was to ship the MVP and put it in front of users as fast as possible so that the iterations can begin. Therefore, we recorded the episode on Apr 19 and I released a fully edited version to the public on Apr 23. Even before experimenting with this new format, I had resolved to ensure that whenever an episode gets recorded, it gets released within the next few days.\n\nThis idea also stems from my frustration wherein I was a guest on podcasts where the episodes were still not public even after a few months of recording. I thought this was just my experience but talking to others in my network, this apparently is quite common.\n\nGiven we live in an age where content is being thrown at us with high velocity from every direction, even the most insightful conversations have a relatively limited shelf life. An episode recorded 2 months back is likely to feel stale to listeners today. Then why are these part-time recorders hell-bent on maintaining a huge backlog of recorded material?\n\nI was brainstorming this with my better half and an interesting idea developed during the conversation. Whenever someone thinks of starting anything new, say a habit like working out or reading regularly, a side hustle, a passive income project, or even a full-time venture, they should expect to enter the “Funnel of Doing New Stuff”.\n\nThis is how the funnel plays out in real life – almost everyone out there is constantly ideating about something new they want to do. Everyone wants to start posting more on LinkedIn, or write more, or hike more, or network more.\n\nHowever, this is where the first stage of drop-offs happens. Very few people take the first step. The inertia of being busy with daily life kicks in for most people. Other times, it’s the fear of failure that stops folks. Or the potential public embarrassment in case things don’t work out.\n\nNext, for the few brave hearts who take the first step, a new challenge awaits them. This is the challenge of staying consistent with this new thing. This is another stage of massive drop-offs, where people begin but don’t consistently execute and eventually give up.\n\nI see a few psychological aspects at play in this stage of the funnel. People generally struggle with any new habit formation, in part because they are unaware of nudges and brain hacks one can use to make the process easier.\n\nAlso, we are dopamine-driven creatures wherein our brain naturally seeks excitement. And this excitement is easily found more in doing new things and getting into new experiences (eg. travel, adventure sports, trying new restaurants, social media, etc.) vs. repeating the same task. Hence, consistent repetition is always a mental and psychological challenge for most people.\n\nNow, even for this next cohort of amazing souls who have both started and also stayed consistent, the game isn’t over yet. For any new initiative to translate into real outcomes (business, financial, or life), it’s crucial to constantly iterate and improve on the initial minimal offering (eg. my podcast MVP).\n\nThe initial phase of any new project is almost always internally driven – a hypothesis, belief system, or worldview. But for it to resonate with others – your users, customers, audience, partners, or even your own sensibilities, requires running a continuous feedback loop that includes perpetual learning and refinement until people start loving it. Then, this love is a currency that one can use to drive many types of outcomes.\n\nThis loop of continuous iteration and improvement isn’t natural to even the best talent, hence there are again drop-offs at this final stage of the funnel. Staying grounded in reality, listening to feedback, and having the humility to change or let go of stuff are all ingredients needed to succeed at this stage. Many don’t make the cut here.\n\nThis funnel idea also has an interesting implication for how one should view competition. At a macro level, most fields look cluttered and competitive because one tends to focus on the top of the funnel (the ideating mass) as competition. The reality is that the real competition is at the bottom of the funnel – the handful of highly driven people who started, stayed consistent, and also constantly improved with each rep*. That number is usually fairly small in whatever area or field you look at, and in my view, there is always room for more there.\n\n*An analogy that people who grew up in India would understand – for a serious student attempting to crack the prestigious IIT JEE engg. entrance exam, the competition isn’t the 1Mn students who have registered to take the exam but only the ~100k or so who have put in adequate reps to prep for it.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nImmigrants Building The Future\n\nAs we enter the era of a new generation of critical technologies, from AI and AR/VR to EVs and robotics, the technical and entrepreneurial horsepower of immigrants will be more important than ever for Silicon Valley.\n\nYesterday, I had the opportunity to attend Entrepreneur First‘s first-ever demo day in San Francisco. Folks in the US and India might not be too familiar with EF – they are one of Europe’s top incubator programs, with a particularly strong presence in London and programs now in Paris, New York, and Bangalore.\n\nEF’s model is interesting – they operate in the -1 to 0 stage, spotting deeply technical founders, mostly in their early-to-mid 20s with many straight out of college, and help them identify and incubate a startup idea that aligns with their core technical skillsets and achievements.\n\nAnd they are definitely spotting some outlier talent. Within this cohort, I saw everything from a Math Olympiad gold medalist, a Material Science PhD from Cambridge, and a 3rd year PhD dropout in Brain-Computer Interfaces to a Formula 1 aerodynamics engineer, someone who built systems for the US Department of Defense and another who worked on JP Morgan’s first AI systems.\n\nThis is what made the demo day super interesting for me. With the advent of AI, Europe is gaining prominence in the global tech scene courtesy of excellent technical universities and research institutions that produce some of the most cutting-edge research talent. A majority of EF cohort companies are in deeptech/ applied sciences and therefore, this demo day in a way, gave a glimpse into the future that leading AI research can potentially bring to life.\n\nMy 1 line takeaway from seeing these 32 companies pitch – the future is brighter, and full of “tech magic”, than we can probably imagine right now. Get a load of some of the ideas that are already in early productization:\n\n1/ World’s first AI training processor using photons (directly taking on Nvidia).\n\n2/ Optimizing farming 24×7 with low-cost swarms of Roomba-like robots that live in fields and spray everything from fertilizers to pesticides.\n\n3/ AI platform that does automatic product placement within creator videos (a YouTuber can place everything from a Nike shoe to a Fiji bottle within a video in a matter of minutes).\n\n4/ AI-powered real-time language translation that freelancers in non-English speaking nations can use to work with clients across geos.\n\n5/ Exponentially simplifying going from a 3D render to a detailed pre-manufacturing drawing & design for any production process.\n\n6/ Non-invasive neural links that can help soldiers in a hot zone communicate with each other without talking (telepathy brought to life?).\n\nThe raw intellect of these founders, combined with the product progress they appeared to have made in a short period, makes me think that many of these ideas are not that far away from commercialization.\n\nWhat EF is smartly doing is relocating this entire batch to Silicon Valley, where the founders will live full-time, building product and raising capital. Seeing the ambition level of ideas the cohort is taking on, they definitely need the risk appetite and vision-backing mindset of the Bay Area. Can’t think of any other ecosystem in the world where such technically complex and capital-intensive ideas can be backed by a combination of talent, risk capital, institutional knowledge, and diverse networks.\n\nWhich brings me to another thought – how talented immigrants continue to move to the Bay Area to build the future. Imagine such unique outlier talent from places like Europe and India choosing to uproot themselves from their home countries, moving to the Valley, and offering their unique skills & knowledge to companies here. This makes me super-long on the Bay Area and clearly shows that the Silicon Valley immigration flywheel is still as strong as ever.\n\nThis macro trend is what also makes me equally excited about India’s emergence as a key supplier of founder talent for the world. And not just to the US, but also to regions like SE Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. I believe the Indian diaspora will make a defining impact on the global knowledge economy over the next 20 years. Combine this with the rise of a new generation of critical technologies (AI, EVs, AR/ VR, robotics, semiconductors, etc.), and this transforms into a generational opportunity that energizes me as a venture investor in the US-India corridor.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nEarly Career Points Count\n\nLife is cumulative. It unfolds in a geometric progression and therefore, the timing of your initial wins has a major impact on future outcomes down the road.\n\nMet someone earlier this week who has had a bunch of major outcomes as an angel investor. This sparked my curiosity and I asked him about his backstory and career trajectory. Turns out these venture outcomes were a result of a series of parlays and things coming together over a decade-and-a-half:\n\nHe was early at a leading startup in the mobile supercycle, which was acquired by a BigTech in a marquee transaction. He continued at the BigTech for a few years (which in hindsight, was still relatively small at that stage), thus rapidly compounding both his net worth and network.\n\nHis spouse was an early engineer at a now-leading BigTech, then left to become an early engineer at a startup that was acquired in another OG marquee transaction. Through this journey, she also built a deep relationship with one of the OG Tier 1 venture firms in the Valley.\n\nThe couple used the capital acquired from this track record to start writing angel checks. Alumni of all the companies they worked at gave them access to some of the best deals.\n\nThe guy also went on to join a venture firm later, which further added to his creds and network.\n\nEssentially, as a direct outcome of their early individual successes, this couple benefited from a self-compounding flywheel of relationships and capital. Pooling these assets as a married-team further magnified their impact. To their credit, in addition to being highly capable, they had the hustle, risk appetite, and foresight to keep taking shots at various opportunities that came along their way.\n\nBtw, this story is not that uncommon in Silicon Valley. Though the extent of financial outcomes might vary, I know of many such stories where people have benefited from similar flywheels in their tech careers. In fact, this is one of the things that makes the Valley a unique place as there is an adequate density of talent, capital, networks, positive intent, and implicit trust within a small geographical region, which enables such flywheels to take shape in people’s lives. PS: I had written about this idea in my post ‘The Success Flywheel‘.\n\nThis story also highlights the importance of something I think about a lot, even from reflecting on my own career – there is a massive advantage to putting points on the board early on in life.\n\nLife is cumulative. It unfolds in a geometric progression and therefore, the timing of your initial wins has a major impact on future outcomes down the road.\n\nMark Spitznagel, famous tail-risk trader and Taleb’s Partner at Universa, talks about this concept in the context of financial portfolio management and risk mitigation in his book ‘Safe Haven‘.\n\nWe are not a casino, or a portfolio of our distribution of possible simultaneous returns. Rather, we are one wager compounded through time. We only get one chance, and, if we shine a bright light on that, we will avoid many mistakes—start thinking about the right things, with a better internal valuation metric: making sure this chance maximizes its chance.\n\nSafe Haven (by Mark Spitznagel)\n\nThe idea is simple but powerful – having early wins enables the player to parlay the fruits of that win into the next opportunity while also having a long enough time runway for significant geometric compounding.\n\nBeing in the right zipcode like Silicon Valley in tech or NY in finance, also provides a large enough sample set of opportunities for continuous parlaying as well as high rates of compounding given the inherent leverage in these ecosystems.\n\nThis idea also makes the case for why students try so hard to get into Ivy Leagues, or why VCs try their best to get into prominent logos early in their track records. It also frames the competitive advantage folks get by starting as a fresh undergrad Analyst at Goldman, engineers who joined Google in the mid-2000s straight out of college, or those in their 20s joining OpenAI right now. The difference in getting these early wins starts showing up a decade later when the slope of the curve of these folks is markedly steeper than those who didn’t.\n\nOf course, logging early wins isn’t by itself a sufficient driver or a definite leading signal of holistic success later in life. Everyone has their own unique journey and has to walk their own path. Still, given the sheer leverage these early points provide, it’s worthwhile to have this at the back of your head while executing your career strategy.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers.\n\nIndia Needs To Avoid This Mistake From The Mobile Supercycle\n\nIn Q4 2014, top 3 Indian OEMs Micromax, Intex, and Lava together had >30% smartphone market share. In Q4 2023, there are now ZERO Indian companies in the top 5 smartphone vendors!\n\nThere is a critical lesson here that India needs to learn as the AI supercycle dawns on it.\n\nIt has been fascinating to see videos showcasing Xiaomi’s SU7 EV sedan emerge over the last few days. The interior UX, in particular, looks fantastic. With BYD having entered India in 2021, and Xiaomi’s well-known expertise in product design and global distribution, China has emerged as a powerful player in the global EV space. Of course, with its prowess in hardware manufacturing, it was never a question of ‘if’, only ‘when’!\n\nIn parallel, the AI supercycle in the US is having positive ripple effects in hardware and robotics. Apple is expected to make significant progress in the next couple of years on the 1st gen Vision Pro. Meta is focused on rapidly improving the Quest 3, while it also collaborates on the Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuck also recently spoke about developing a neural interface in the form of a wristband, which can read the signals your brain sends to hands and arms.\n\nUS startups are already going gun-ho on imagining new form factors to deliver AI capabilities to users. These include AI pins, AI necklaces, and desktop robots that turn your smartphone into a whimsical companion.\n\nWith massive investments going into the chips and infra layer in the AI cycle (read my post: ‘AI Musings #6: The Bull Run Is Just Beginning (90s Telecom Boom Vibes)‘), the resulting drop in compute prices and democratized access to it is providing tailwinds to hardware verticals whose adoption has been previously blocked by uncomfortable form factors.\n\nWith all this hardware action in the US and China, I believe it’s a matter of national importance that India now steps up its game in key verticals of consumer hardware, and avoids ceding this territory to overseas players.\n\nIn the mobile supercycle, I had a ringside view into how in smartphones, homegrown Indian companies like Micromax, Karbonn, Intex, and Lava didn’t end up investing in domestic manufacturing capabilities, playing the short-sighted game of buying stock hardware from Chinese OEMs/ ODMs, and just putting a sticker and packaging on it.\n\nFurther, even with a solid local software talent pool, these companies also under-invested in software, building only basic wrappers on top of stock Android. Essentially, Indian smartphone OEMs ignored both these key areas of competitive differentiation, diverting capital away from capex & R&D, and towards brand building and customer acquisition.\n\nThis strategy was found wanting when Chinese OEMs like Xiaomi and OnePlus aggressively entered the Indian market. Given their deep manufacturing and digital expertise in China, these companies had strong differentiation in both hardware and software. Plus, they had deep pockets to outspend Indian OEMs on marketing. Therefore, despite entering the Indian market much later and starting well-behind Samsung and Indian OEMs, Chinese smartphone companies managed to build strong local brands in a fraction of the time.\n\nThe end result is this – in Q4 2014, top 3 Indian OEMs Micromax, Intex, and Lava together had >30% smartphone market share. In Q4 2023, there are now ZERO Indian companies in the top 5 smartphone vendors!\n\nGiven the ambitious goals we are setting for the Indian economy over the next decade, and the national importance of critical technologies like AI, automotive, energy, space and defense, it’s important India doesn’t repeat the strategic mistakes of the mobile supercycle. It’s imperative that indigenous hardware capabilities get built during this next AI supercycle (and other constituent subcycles in AR/VR, EVs, space etc.).\n\nFrom what I am hearing about all the foundational work already happening in semiconductors, automotive, space, and general manufacturing, this is totally doable if the Indian public and private sectors can come together, backed by an encouraging policy stance from the govt. We are already seeing early greenshoots of this in space tech, where ISRO is actively collaborating with Indian spacetech startups.\n\nI want to throw out a challenge for Indian founders, asking them to be more courageous in picking tough hardware problems to solve. There is enough global capital available that is positive on India and in its chase for alpha, will be ready to back this courage.\n\nFurther, this is also the right time for Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Mahindra to step up in a meaningful way and drive INR capex in these critical sectors. In parallel, the govt’s policies should ensure that while hardware manufacturing attracts investments from all over the world, the strength of homegrown players also get built up in this supercycle.\n\nChina is a good example of leveraging foreign capital to strengthen its domestic manufacturing and digital capabilities. Technology indigenization is critical in this age of fickle geo-politics where everything from trade to currencies are being weaponized.\n\nThis current generation of Indian founders also have the benefit of home-grown role models like Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, who stood up to US and Chinese competition in eCommerce, ultimately ensuring a homegrown & enduring market leader like Flipkart continues to thrive to this day.\n\nSubscribe\n\nto my weekly newsletter where in addition to my long-form posts, I will also share a weekly recap of all my social posts & writings, what I loved to read & watch that week + other useful insights & analysis exclusively for my subscribers."
