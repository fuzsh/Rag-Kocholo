        "text": "Nokia’s recent announcement to acquire Infinera marks another significant step in the company’s extensive history of mergers and acquisitions. This deal aims to enhance Nokia’s networking capabilities, solidifying its position as a leader in the telecommunications industry. Over the years, Nokia has strategically acquired companies like Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, which greatly expanded its telecommunications equipment and services portfolio. This merger itself was a combination of Alcatel and Lucent Technologies, highlighting the layers of consolidation that have shaped Nokia into a global powerhouse.\n\nAlongside these acquisitions, Nokia has been actively restructuring to streamline its operations and enhance profitability. As part of a strategic plan announced in October 2023, Nokia aims to empower its business groups with more autonomy and agility.

The restructuring plan targets a reduction in the cost base by EUR 800–1,200 million by the end of 2026, involving significant operational changes and a projected reduction in personnel from 86,000 to between 72,000 and 77,000 employees.
