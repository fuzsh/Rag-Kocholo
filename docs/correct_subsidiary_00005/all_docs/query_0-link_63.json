        "text": "Last week, the Finnish telecom gear maker said it will acquire its Franco-American rival in an all-stock deal valued at 15.6 billion euros ($16.6 billion).\n\nThis will create an entity with a combined market cap of about 45 billion euro (close to $49 billion) and a revenue base of around 26 billion euro (about $28 billion).\n\nBased on annualised revenue figures of 2014 fiscal, Nokia earned a revenue of 12.7 billion euro, with 26 per cent (about euro 3.4 billion) coming in from APJ/India.\n\nIn the case of Alcatel-Lucent, whose 2014 revenue stood at 13.2 billion euro, 10 per cent (about 1.3 billion euro) flowed from APJ/India, according to data with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIf the deal goes through, the firm’s combined revenue base will hit 26 billion euro, with APJ/India contributing 18 per cent or 4.7 billion euro (about $5 billion or close to Rs 31,300 crore).\n\nInteracting with reporters after making the announcement, Nokia President and CEO Rajeev Suri said: “Our strengthened presence in all geographies —- particularly in the US, China, Europe and Asia-Pacific —- would give us the scale and reach to better serve our customers’ global needs.”\n\nNokia Group will lead the new firm — Nokia Corporation — with Risto Siilasmaa to serve as Chairman and Suri as Chief Executive Officer. The combined entity will have a headcount of about 1.14 lakh.\n\nThe two firms announced that the deal is likely to be completed in the first half of 2016 and will result in 900 million euro of operating cost savings by 2019-end.\n\nThis can be the biggest deal in the telecom industry since Lucent Technologies acquired Ascend Communications for about $21 billion in 1999 and can be compared with Alcatel’s 2006 purchase of Lucent for $13.4 billion.\n\nIt will be bigger than Nokia’s acquisition of map provider Navteq Corp for about $8 billion in 2008. Nokia had last year sold its struggling devices business to Microsoft for over $7.2 billion and is now exploring the sale of its HERE mapping unit, which analysts are estimating can fetch the firm up to $7.5 billion."
