        "text": "Protecting humanity from dangerous space objects\n\nThe Earth is silently but continuously threatened by near-Earth objects—asteroids—some of which we will not spot until it is too late. The National Space Society works tirelessly to urge Congress to address these potential Earth-wrecking objects, but much remains to be done.\n\nThe Way Forward for Clean, Limitless Energy\n\nImagine a world in the not-distant future where millions of animal species have gone extinct, the oceans are dying, agriculture is failing, and humanity clings by a thread. None of us want that, but we are facing this potentially existential threat. We know what needs to be done, and we need your help.\n\nOrbital Debris\n\nOrbital debris is a term used to describe derelict objects in space, including fragments of spacecraft, discarded equipment, and debris from explosions. This debris can travel at high speeds, causing damage to satellites and spacecraft, and poses a risk to future space exploration and commercial activities.\n\nNSS Space Settlement Nexus\n\nWe look forward to people living and working in thriving communities spread throughout the solar system, making use of the vast resources of space for the betterment of humanity. As space resources are discovered and developed more and more people will find it advantageous to live and work in space, culminating in a sustainable ecosystem of settlements in both free space and on various celestial bodies. A foundational principle of our vision is that space must be open to all nations and all peoples, with no artificial limits on who can go or how they choose to live."
