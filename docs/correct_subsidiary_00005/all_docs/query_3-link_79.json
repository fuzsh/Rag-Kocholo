        "text": "NVIDIA, AMD, and now Cornami, Inc. (backed by Applied Materials, Qualcomm, & SoftBank Investment Advisers) are accelerating AI use cases. NVIDIA earns most of the headlines around chip production, other chipmakers are expanding production and services in an effort to compete. One such competitor, AMD, recently announced plans to acquire Silo AI for $665 million in an effort to challenge NVIDIA, whose valuation recently surpassed $3 trillion. NVIDIA’s competitors have increasingly been focused on funding or acquiring businesses that can help them compete with the market leader, as evidenced by the amount of money raised by a number of other AI startups, as well as by AMD’s above acquisition, and AMD’s recent rollout of its line of MI300 chips. In an economy where the race to the top of the computing market shows no signs of slowing down, the need for top-of-the line chips, artificial intelligence-enabled services, and increased cybersecurity are quickly accelerating. Companies that fall into any of these niches, such as Impact Venture Capital portfolio company Cornami, Inc., will allow for fast, accurate data processing while maintaining data security. Cornami, as a provider of greater security via fully-homomorphic encryption, represents a potential future direction for the market, as companies like it will only grow in importance with the increasing amount of data moved yearly. Safe, secure computing will be integral to the future success of the technologically-driven society that we are moving towards in the wake of events like COVID-19 that accelerated the digital transition. The ability of financial and healthcare systems, as well as other necessary infrastructure, to securely transmit sensitive data will likely be a primary driver of how quickly we can move towards a more interconnected world. Impact Venture Capital's investment in Cornami represents a commitment to helping fund a safer digital future and to help enable our world to work more connected, but also more secure, than ever before.

MBA, Alexander Fortmüller, Yatish Mishra https://lnkd.in/gYEmpS88\n\nFollowing his success in building a $24 Billion company using a new business process, it was fun to see the movie about Rob Ryan - and spend time with him! \"The Man Who Saved The Internet With a Sunflower\", had its World Premiere at the Dances with Films Festival in Los Angeles last Friday. This incredible true story stars Martin Delaney as Rob Ryan and is directed by ori yardeni. The movie documents Rob Ryan's launch of Ascend Communications (with the support of his wife Terry Ryan) and its growth all the way through its acquisition by Lucent Technologies for $24 Billion in 1999 -- the largest technology acquisition in history at that time. Entrepreneurs: Take a few minutes to learn about the \"sunflower\" business process as you launch and scale your new tech startup . . . and learn from one of the greatest technology entrepreneurs the world has ever known: Rob Ryan.\n\nThanks Lori Rianda -- it was great you made time on behalf of Bank of America to join us for the Oak Ridge High School Entrepreneurs Club showcase event! The President of the ORHS Entrepreneurs Club (my daughter) Makena Crawford and I were also happy to meet your community collaborators Susan Nelson / Deb Jolette / MariJane Lopez-Taff from Junior Achievement USA and learn about the @National Association of Women Business Owners. I look forward to expanding my collaboration with you and the team from Bank of America to continue supporting education and entrepreneurship in Northern California.
