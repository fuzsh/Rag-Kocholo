        "text": "Tammy Kehe, Owner and President of Network Affiliates, carries a deep admiration for her experiences with the late Norton Frickey who pioneered legal advertising and personally hired Kehe in 1987.\n\nAfter more than 30 years of committed tenure, her ascent within the organization is a point of pride and testament to her unwavering belief in Network’s singular purpose: to provide exclusive, loyal marketing partnerships, superior expertise and results to attorneys across the country.\n\nKehe has been a recognized speaker and panelist at both local and national legal conventions. She is a published thought-leader and particularly enjoys exploring and demonstrating the power of extraordinary branding—and that no matter the market challenge, incredible things are possible when collaboration, creativity, and wicked strategy are leveraged in new and exciting ways.\n\nIn addition to managing day-to-day operations at Network Affiliates, Kehe is deeply invested in the individual success of every Network member along with the goals and aspirations they have for their firms, their families, and communities.\n\n“Client relationships are, and always have been, our top priority,” says Kehe. “Network members are like family to us, and we cultivate those relationships with our own experience and personal investment in every partnership we make. We cherish our clients!”\n\nTammy is a proud Colorado native with a deep commitment to family. While in college at the University of Colorado Boulder, she met the love of her life, Eric, and together they’ve raised three incredible young men who all share a passion for sports. “Bleachers are my life!” she says. “And life is very good!”\n\nBridget has more than 15 years of advertising experience, including media research, planning, buying, auditing, and account management. Her first marketing job came while in college as an Account Management intern at Network Affiliates in 1995! Her fondness for numbers and data drew her to the world of media, where she enjoys creating and utilizing efficient processes to strategize and implement strong media placement. From the beginning to the end of a campaign, she treats each client’s dollar as if it were her own.\n\nBridget has a Business degree with an emphasis in marketing & international business from the University of Colorado. She’s a Colorado native and enjoys traveling, snowboarding, and reading a good book. She also loves good ole’ American road-trips and mountain hikes with her family.\n\nIt’s hard to explain what a Vice President of production services does. Some days I sit in that big director’s chair and yell “action”. Other days I sit in a room with our amazing and talented creative staff thinking of the next great legal creative campaign that will generate all kinds of leads and cases. And others, I’m sitting in an edit suite nitpicking over the tiniest of details, because what may seem like a trivial detail actually makes a big difference in the end product. I’m very grateful to work with such an amazing group of creatives, producers, editors, sound engineers, colorists, photographers and on and on. We take a lot of pride in what we do at Network, and we do legal creative like nobody else. We know our creative isn’t meant for every law firm, but what we do know is we’re going to give it everything we’ve got to make sure the clients we do work with have the best creative in their market, and are blowing the doors off the competition. I love what I do, I love this place, and I’m very proud of what we create.\n\nKara Wilkoff is a true Renaissance woman. She has a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Denver with a major in Statistics and a minor in Psychology. Before she became an on-set Producer and Casting Director at Network Affiliates, Kara was the Budget & Operations Manager for a local non-profit and even became a Registered Nurse (RN)! In 2016, she joined a talent agency and began her acting career; and she did all of this while being a loving partner and committed parent to three children.\n\nKara brings organization, creativity, and high-level communication to all production projects at Network Affiliates. Her passion for people and client-first mentality make Kara extremely personable, giving clients room to explore their own creativity in a safe, collaborative environment.\n\nWhen Kara’s not busy being creative you’ll find her enjoying the great outdoors with family and friends. Kara is an athlete and enjoys running, hiking, and playing sports.\n\nWhere would we all be without Nancy? We certainly don’t want to find out! Nancy has been an integral part of Network Affiliates for more than 35 years and knows every “in and out” of our lawyer advertising business. There isn’t a department in existence that Nancy doesn’t contribute to. She is the mastermind behind our attorney networking convention preparation, and the right-hand person to our attorney advertising agency management team. In addition, she works closely with our media department and production department to ensure the smooth order of commercial selection and schedule implementation.\n\n“Network is a special place. Where else can you find an organization so completely dedicated to professional service marketing with such a wide variety of client associations spanning over 20 years, while maintaining a family atmosphere with great opportunities for growth? Network Affiliates is that organization!”\n\nThe epitome of a “family woman”, Nancy enjoys sharing time with her two grown children, Steve and Shannon, as well as her extended family, Granddaughters, Taylor and Amelia and Great-Granddaughter, Esme. She loves to travel and looks forward to many more years with the Network family!\n\nNatasha has been with Network Affiliates for more than 15 years, and now serves as the company’s Controller. In this role, Natasha manages the company’s operational accounting and staff, is responsible for the generation of financial reports, maintains the accounting system as well as the company’s cash flow.\n\nNatasha holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting and started her career in the field working for a non-profit agency in her hometown of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She and her husband moved to the Denver area in 2006 and absolutely love everything Colorado has to offer. In her free time, she enjoys going out to see live music, working in her garden in the summer and cuddling up with a good book in the winter.\n\nAdrianne Patton, or Adi, as we like to call her, has served as the Staff Accountant on the Network Affiliates team since April 2017. With nearly a decade of administrative accounting experience, Adi brings efficiency and integrity to our company’s financial recording processes. She aides in maintaining daily, financial operations while working closely with the media team to produce timely and accurate billing for our clients. Adi is a Colorado native and is honored to work for a Colorado proud company alongside great co-works and high end clientele. One of her career highlights is the selfie she managed to capture with David Gruber! When Adi isn’t working, she loves getting into the next home improvement project with her husband, Adam, or playing in the sun with her two Aussies, Indy and Toby.\n\nAn Account Director at Network Affiliates since the mid-90s, Brian serves as a primary point person between the agency and the attorney advertising clients. He tries to approach each work day with a simple motto –understand what the client is saying or asking, respond as promptly and appropriately as possible and learn something new. “I’m very ‘seasoned’ in my role at Network Affiliates. I don’t know all the answers, but I’m completely focused on finding a right answer…and the best solution. Network Affiliates is a wonderfully collaborative agency that is exceptionally privileged to work with some of the country’s leading law firms. After 20+ years, I’m still honored to come to work each day.”\n\nBrian has worked with numerous clients on their advertising and marketing campaigns including television, radio and print, and he’s even learned a thing or two about streaming services. He understands how to generate cases for you – whether through personal injury, workers comp, social security disability, or mass tort advertising campaigns.\n\nA proud alumnus of Colorado State University, Brian enjoys his time away from the office at a Saturday tailgate, or on a high-country trail avoiding rattlesnakes and some the region’s other scary critters.\n\nAfter more than 10 years in marketing, seven as a Media Buyer/Planner in the Automotive Industry, Kasey joined Network Affiliates’ Team in 2020. “Planning and buying media within the automotive industry was a wonderful experience, but after a decade, I was ready to expand and grow my expertise within a new vertical .” So the Montreal native, and longtime resident of South Florida packed up her car and moved to Denver. “I’ve loved digging into media buying for personal injury attorneys. Although the mediums may be similar (TV, Cable, Radio, Outdoor and Streaming Media), the thought process for selling and stimulating demand for a product is vastly different than the thought process for elevating a brand and “selling” a professional service. My philosophy has always been to use a firm but fair approach in negotiating.” A proud alumnus of the University of Florida (Go Gators!), Kasey enjoys her time away from the office discovering her new hometown, learning to exercise at altitude and learning to ski (and drive in the snow). Outside of the fact I have a naked cat (Hi Drax!), most people are surprised to know I have a love of music and am an avid record collector.\n\nKatie graduated from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln in 2018 with a degree in Marketing and a degree Business Management. Growing up in Nebraska, Katie and her family would vacation in Breckenridge every year. She was attracted to Colorado’s energy, its outdoor recreation, and the opportunity to explore a new mountain town every weekend! So, after graduation, Katie moved to make Colorado her forever home.\n\nIn the summer, Katie can be found hiking, camping, traveling, going to farmer’s markets, and practicing yoga. In the winter, you’ll find her on the ski slopes or, more likely, inside the lodge by the fire. Katie is thankful to find family and community at Network Affiliates, which has become her home away from home.\n\nKirk grew up in Littleton, Colorado causing trouble and playing instruments from an early age.

By nature, “I’m curious and a problem solver.” Whether that was formulating a sound strategy for a marketing campaign, managing schedules related to her children’s events and activities, and her husband’s business, along with some freelance writing interests and specialties, and now back at Network Affiliates picking up right where she left off in 2006, she remains committed to ensuring things run well, run right and are successful!. “I’m so excited to be back ‘home,’ helping our clients and their firms grow their business and elevate their brand.”\n\nRemember: “Success is not final; Failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” ~Winston Churchill\n\nOriginally from Venezuela, Javier moved to the U.S. in 2000 and received his B.F.A. with a concentration in graphic design at Colorado State University.

A native of Queens, NY, he came to Colorado to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder and never left! However, he still remains a true Mets, Jets, Knicks and Rangers fan. In his many years here, Eric has done it all! His career in post-production has taken him from client services and tape room operator, to editor, producer, senior colorist, and director. The landscape of production and post has evolved over the years, and so has Eric’s wonderful artistic talents and contributions!\n\nIn his free time, Eric can be found spending time with his wife and their two beautiful children.
