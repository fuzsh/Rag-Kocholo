        "text": "Lucent Technologies announced Jan. 13 it will merge with Ascend Communications, creating what may become the world's largest communications networking company. Under terms of the agreementalready approved by each company's board of directorseach share of Ascend will be converted into 0.825 shares of Lucent. Based on the Lucent's Jan. 12 closing price of $107-7/8, the deal is valued at approximately $20 billion.\n\nThe move continues the consolidation of the networking hardware business into three major powerhouses: Lucent, Nortel Networks, and Cisco Systems. Both Lucent, spun-off from AT&T in April 1996, and Canadian telephone equipment-maker Nortel have strong backgrounds in traditional voice equipment. Each company also has been on a shopping spree in recent years to build up their data networking expertise. A notable example is Nortel's $9.1 billion merger with Bay Networks in Aug. 1998.\n\nIn the last two years Lucent has acquired 11 companies with strategic networking skills making it possible for the company to introduce more than 30 new products in 1998 alone. Lucent's strategy has proven successful. For fiscal year ended Sept. 1998, its revenues rose 14% to $30.15 billion, while net income rose 79% to $970 million.\n\nThe Lucent/Ascend merger will allow the company to compete head-to-head with Cisco, the Silicon Valley-based giant that literally invented data networking as it exists today. Ascend competes directly with Cisco selling the hardware the comprises the Internet. Through its own acquisition of Cascade Communications in 1997, Ascend enjoys a large installed base of asynchronous transfer mode backbone switches installed at the core of the Internet. The battle to upgrade these switches with newer technology is now shaping up and Lucent has made itself a major contender.\n\nConcurrent with the merger, Lucent is establishing a Broadband Networks Group to be led by Dan Stanzione, Lucent's chief operating officer and group president. The new group will consist of the Ascend organization combined with Lucent's data networking systems, optical networking, and communications software groups. Bell Labs, Lucent's research arm, will continue to report to Stanzione. Ascend's CEO, Mory Ejabat, will stay with Lucent for a transitional period.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be completed during Lucent's third fiscal quarter ending Jun. 30, 1999, and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Lucent expects the merger to be neutral to earnings in fiscal 1999 and accretive beginning in fiscal 2000, the first full year of combined operation."
