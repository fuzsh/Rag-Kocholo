Hans Zimmer often named Ennio Morricone as his idol and role-model, whose repertoire will be feautured with excerpts from „The Good, the Bad and the Ugly“ and „Once Upon a Time in America“.\n\nZimmer followed Morricones example of composing the film music before instead of after filming and shaped the entire work. For example he changed the beginning of Ridley Scott’s „Gladiator“, subsequently the world-famous director moved into the studio of Hans Zimmer, who is an artist with a social conscience and who also composed a song for the victims of the Batman cinema shooting in Aurora, as well as music against climate change – all of which will be heard in the program.\n\n„The Music of Hans Zimmer & Others – A Celebration of Filmmusic“ will be performed by an international film orchestra and choir, and star soloists who will perform Gladiator and Ennio Morricone’s „Ecstasy of Gold“ as well as excerpts from The Lion King, Zimmers most recent boxoffice-smash-hit – in an impressive show with light installations, laser projections and selected film clips.\n\n„The Music of Hans Zimmer & Others – A Celebration of Filmmusic“ is an unforgettable audiovisual event for all age groups, film enthusiasts, music lovers and families.\n\nExcerpt from the musical program:\n\nTop Gun\n\nDune\n\nJames Bond\n\nThe Lion King\n\nPirates of the Caribbean\n\nGladiator\n\nPearl Harbour\n\nInterstellar\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nDunkirk\n\nInception\n\nEarth\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nMan of Steel\n\nSpider-Man\n\nEnnio Morricone:\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\n\nOnce upon a time in America\n\nCOMPOSERS\n\nHANS ZIMMER\n\nHans Florian Zimmer (*September 12, 1957 in Frankfurt on Main) is a German film composer, arranger and music producer.
