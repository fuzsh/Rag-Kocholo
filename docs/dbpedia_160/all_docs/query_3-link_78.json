        "text": "#20: “Iron Man” by Black Sabbath\n\n“Iron Man” (2008)\n\nWhile it might be on the nose, the end song for the Marvel film “Iron Man” still provides the needed jolt to emphasize the surprise ending. As Tony Stark announces that he’s been the armored crusader all along, the erupting chaos gives way to the metal classic. Sure, Black Sabbath’s famous hit was an obvious choice, but it sold the moment better than any track could. Leaving comic book fans pumped, this song ensured that every theatergoer would leave with a dose of pure metal energy. As the unofficial theme of the movie, the rock riff of “Iron Man” is the jewel in the crown of a hugely entertaining movie.\n\n#19: “Surf Rider” by The Lively Ones\n\n“Pulp Fiction” (1994)\n\nAfter the many twists and turns of Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” the film finally ends back at the beginning of the story. Hitmen Jules and Vincent survive a robbery at a diner and casually exit before the cops arrive. In a laidback stroll, the stars leave the restaurant as \"Surf Rider\" rings out. Playing into the film’s usage of surf rock, this track by The Lively Ones was the perfect song to encapsulate the cool demeanor of the assassins’ exit. Helping to get across an easygoing, California vibe, their beach-inspired single brilliantly wrapped up this 90s masterpiece.\n\n#18: “Just Like Honey” by The Jesus and Mary Chain\n\n“Lost in Translation” (2003)\n\nSofia Coppola’s romantic comedy “Lost in Translation” features an iconic performance from Bill Murray, along with a stellar soundtrack. To close out the film, Coppola’s choice of “Just Like Honey” captures the wistful and melancholic nature of the open-ended conclusion. After Murray’s character whispers an unheard message to Scarlet Johansson, the two part ways to most likely never see each other again. Capturing the mood, The Jesus and Mary Chain song haunts the final minutes as the actor contemplates his future. Something in the track soothes the viewer, making it seem that the two leads were changed for the better. Whatever the true meaning of the ending was, “Just Like Honey” provided the perfect counterpoint.\n\n#17: “Heroes” by David Bowie\n\n“The Perks of Being a Wallflower” (2012)\n\nEarly in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” lead character Charlie accompanies his two new friends through a tunnel while listening to this David Bowie song. That track, “Heroes,” would come to be their anthem as a friend group and as people. It’s only fitting that it comes back once more to end the film. Driving through the same tunnel, Charlie stands up and embraces the wind as the inspirational hit plays the film out. Despite all of the character’s personal troubles and uncertainties, it’s the final moment that provides him with a new lease on life. With the help of Bowie’s glorious song, anything feels possible for the young cast as they drive into the night.\n\n#16: “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth\n\n“Furious 7” (2015)\n\nIn honor of Paul Walker, the end of \"Furious 7\" featured a heartfelt tribute to the actor. With a song by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, the pop and hip-hop mashup served up an emotional climax and fitting end for the character Brian. Watching the lead actors drive one last time was a special moment that recalled their relationship going back to the first film. Serving up poetic rhymes, Khalifa raps about mourning those who we've left behind. In an intense chorus, singer Puth delivers the hook in a trademark pitch-perfect performance. Punctuating a successful film with a grounded moment of reflection, this ending track proved that even a film like \"Furious 7\" could tug at the heartstrings.\n\n#15: “Extreme Ways” by Moby\n\n“The Bourne Supremacy” (2004)\n\nAfter nearly getting caught by the authorities and assassinated by a Russian hitman, Jason Bourne makes it out of this sequel to fight another day. In his last moments on screen, the former agent calls CIA deputy director Pamela Landy. To help sell the moment, the series' signature song \"Extreme Ways\" gives way to one of the series’ best moments. After Bourne gets another clue about his identity, he reveals that he’s been watching her the entire time. Moby’s introductory cue, with its loud strings, was never used more fittingly. The sense of surprise accentuates the final line, sending the titular operative off to his next adventure.\n\n#14: “Stand by Me” by Ben E. King\n\n“Stand by Me” (1986)\n\nThere was no chance that “Stand by Me” would end without the Ben E. King classic playing at least once. Over the course of the film, the track serves as a theme for the loyalty between four young friends. After he recalls his childhood adventures, the older Gordie looks to his own children as the King hit echoes his final sentiments. According to the lead narrator, there's nothing better than the friendships you have as a kid. While the wise writer leaves to hang out with his own kids, the song becomes much more than an obvious choice. Earning a place at the end of a heartfelt film, \"Stand by Me\" capitalizes on an equally beloved work of art.\n\n#13: “Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime” by Beck\n\n“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004)\n\nMixing romance and sci-fi, “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” contemplated a world where you can erase a relationship from your memory. Jim Carrey’s Joel unsuccessfully recants on the procedure, but ends up reconnecting with his love anyways. Beck's words bring out the hurt and emotion at the heart of this story. Even if Joel and Clementine can't make it work, there's a chance that they'll learn from their past mistakes. Simple and somber, the track delivers the tough love that both the characters and the audience need. Bringing a masterful film to a poignant end, “Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime” makes us believe in both the possibility and imperfections of love.\n\n#12: “Born Slippy .NUXX” by Underworld\n\n“Trainspotting” (1996)\n\n“Trainspotting” and its soundtrack made for one of the cultural touchstones of 90s cinema. As a group of Scottish friends struggle with addiction, Renton kicks the habit and makes off with their cash. Matching the renewed energy of the main character, \"Born Slippy .NUXX\" sends the movie out with a kaleidoscope of trippy sounds. Recounting the opening scene, the character remembers the mantras that kept him moving forward as the Underworld piece plays. On a list of bangers, the dance hit brings a surprising amount of sincere emotion to the final moments of \"Trainspotting.\" Underworld’s “Born Slippy .NUXX” provides a bouncy synth track to follow Ewan McGregor into a questionable world.\n\n#11: “The End” by Doors\n\n“Apocalypse Now” (1979)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s vision of Vietnam began and ended with the immortal words of Jim Morrison. Following Willard's descent into madness as he kills Kurtz, \"Apocalypse Now\" needed a song to match the surreal and poetic feel of the film. Bookending the movie, \"The End\" foreshadows the darkest reaches of the characters' souls. Having already provided a soundtrack for the late 60s and early 70s, The Doors' music was primed to score a story about the Vietnam War. After Kurtz's death, the lead assassin boards a riverboat to reconsider his actions. In conclusion, \"The End\" heightens the impact of a cerebral war film like \"Apocalypse Now.\"\n\n#10: “Bittersweet Symphony” by The Verve\n\n“Cruel Intentions” (1999)\n\nA moderate box-office success, “Cruel Intentions” adapted “Dangerous Liaisons” into a high school setting. Plotting a devious game of deception, step-siblings Sebastian and Kathryn corrupt the lives of other students. With the game leaving the former sibling dead and the latter humiliated, it’s only fitting that “Bittersweet Symphony” concluded the twisted plot on an ambiguous note. The iconic strings enter into the final funeral scene as Kathryn gets her comeuppance. The highly acclaimed track only makes the movie's dramatic conclusion more impactful. With the greatness of The Verve's performance behind it, \"Cruel Intentions\" ends in a wave of both happiness and anguish.\n\n#9: “A Real Hero” by College & Electric Youth\n\n“Drive” (2011)\n\nWith a nod to the 80s, “Drive” paid tribute to crime films with an iconic soundtrack. One of many great songs, \"A Real Hero\" provided the driver with an awesome anthem. Through Nicolas Winding Refn’s vision, the Los Angeles criminal underworld never sounded better. Nothing makes the final drive more atmospheric than this dreamy synth powered song. Once Ryan Gosling’s wounded wheelman drives into the sunset, it becomes clear with this piece accompanying him that real heroes don't wear capes. Even if the main character didn’t get to be with Carey Mulligan, he did get to drive away to a supremely cool track. Without College and Electric Youth’s musical collaboration, “Drive” would’ve been missing a vital ingredient for its striking outcome.\n\n#8: “My Way” by Sid Vicious\n\n“Goodfellas” (1990)\n\nBy the end of “Goodfellas,” gangster Henry Hill became an informant to save his life. Having lost almost everything, the former mobster plans to live out a boring existence in witness protection. In choosing the final song, Scorsese could have easily picked the classic Sinatra version of \"My Way\" to describe the character's decisions. Instead, he chose Sid Vicious' unsympathetic and scorching rendition to end the film. Since the singer's performance comes off like an unremorseful and tongue-in-cheek statement, it adds another compelling layer to the conclusion of the criminal's story. Suggesting that Hill's personality won't mesh well with civilian life, \"Goodfellas\" ends with a sarcastic smile from the lead and the prickly voice of Vicious.\n\n#7: “Mad World” by Michael Andrews feat. Gary Jules\n\n“Donnie Darko” (2001)\n\nAmong the most beloved cult films of the 2000s, “Donnie Darko” was full of breakout performers and amazing songs. As the titular outsider wonders about his newfound visions, tracks like \"Mad World\" give the film its richly textured 80s setting. In the film's final montage, the death of the lead character hangs over the remaining cast as they reel from the tragedy. Accompanying that sequence, Michael Andrews and Gary Jules' version of \"Mad World\" turns a throwback song into a poignant piano ballad. The singer's voice laments the absurdity of modern life, along with the various character's fates coming to fruition. “Donnie Darko” played audiences with its sci-fi and horror ideas, but also left a lasting impression with its usage of this remixed hit.\n\n#6: “Lose Yourself” by Eminem\n\n“8 Mile” (2002)\n\nIn a semi-autobiographical film, Eminem played a Detroit factory worker chasing his dream of being a local rap legend. After his character Jimmy wins his final battle, “8 Mile” closes with the rap anthem “Lose Yourself.” Tapping into his real story and upbringing, the fury of Mather's verses feel especially fitting for such an authentic movie. In many ways, the entire track provided its own epilogue to secure the performer's mythic status. Solidifying Eminem's abilities as an artist, it's hard to imagine the inspirational tale ending with any other song. Becoming bigger than the movie and its ending, this Oscar-winning hit propelled the emcee’s career to the next level.\n\n#5: “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds\n\n“The Breakfast Club” (1985)\n\nThere are few film and song combos as legendary as “The Breakfast Club” and “Don’t You (Forget About Me).” Defining the landscape of the 80s, this teen film provided iconic lines, heartbreaking scenes, and a soundtrack for the decade. Following a productive detention session, the five students part ways as Simple Minds claims that they’ll never forget about each other. Among the iconic images from the film, the track blares as Bender throws his fist into the air. If nothing else, the freeze frame helps sell the inspirational sound of the hit single. Whether or not the teenagers remained friends, the movie and song give the cathartic film a cheerful ending.\n\n#4: “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn\n\n“Dr. Strangelove” (1964)\n\nWith a surprisingly funny vision of nuclear war, \"Dr. Strangelove\" stands as one of the blackest Cold War satires in history. Even though the film ends with nuclear war, there was still room for an ironic song to make it all funny - kind of. Using Vera Lynn's version of \"We'll Meet Again,\" director Stanley Kubrick capped off one of his best movies with a hilarious needle drop. Who knew that visions of explosions could be made to look somewhat hilarious? All it took was the filmmaker's subversive genius to make such destruction sound palatable. With this historic song usage, the genre of film satire was never quite the same.\n\n#3: “Wake Up” by Rage Against the Machine\n\n“The Matrix” (1999)\n\nIn 1999, \"The Matrix\" set a new standard for action filmmaking. It was thematically important that the film end with an image to send viewers out into the world. As Neo prepares to fly, the rumblings of \"Wake Up\" by Rage Against the Machine build until the hero takes flight. A metaphor for the characters \"waking up\" to reality, the use of this rap rock song underscores the film's philosophical explorations. It's a gut punch of fierce guitar that's nothing short of energizing. It's no small feat to end an action film on such a high note and the use of \"Wake Up\" is just the right song to make it all worth it.\n\n#2: “The Sound of Silence” by Simon & Garfunkel\n\n“The Graduate” (1967)\n\nWith a soundtrack from Simon & Garfunkel, the iconic film \"The Graduate\" features many reflective pieces such as \"The Sound of Silence.\" Bookending the film, this mournful track captures the lead character Ben in a state of uncertainty. He spends the entire film looking for a greater purpose, first with a complicated affair with Mrs. Robinson. At the film's end, Ben steals Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine from the altar and boards a bus to start a new life. As the couple realizes that they have no idea where they're going, this Paul Simon-penned classic plays over their complicated expressions. This iconic song perfectly sums up the ambiguity and ambivalence at the heart of \"The Graduate.\"\n\n#1: “Where Is My Mind?” by Pixies\n\n“Fight Club” (1999)\n\nThere are few ending songs that capture the mood and tone of a film better than \"Where is My Mind?\" Director David Fincher concludes his mind-bending satire with a trippy Pixies’ track that questions reality itself. With the narrator witnessing the depth of his illness, the musical number kicks off as the world around him literally crumbles. Edward Norton’s immortal last line feels even more ironic with distorted guitars ringing out underneath him. Having endured a story about dissociation from one's self and society, it's only fitting that this alternative rock piece finishes out the movie. Possibly the most memorable final song choice in film, \"Fight Club\" and \"Where is My Mind?\" will always be a part of pop culture history."
