        "text": "The latest release from Intrada is a five-disc set (!) featuring the scores for FEAR STREET TRILOGY, the three interconnected 2021 horror thrillers (released on Netflix) inspired by the book series by R.L. Stine. The scores were composed by two-time Oscar nominee Marco Beltrami with collaborators Anna Drubich, Brandon Roberts and Marcus Trumpp.\n\nThe latest release from La-La Land is volume 6 in their series STAR TREK - THE ORIGINAL SERIES: THE 1701 COLLECTION, featuring the cues from the original 1960s TV series previously released on the label's epic boxed set. This two-disc set features the scores for the episodes \"And the Children Shall Lead\" (George Duning), \"I, Mudd\" (Samuel Matlovsky), and \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" (Jerry Fielding), as well as alternate, outtakes, and recordings from the show's music library of episodes scored by Duning, Alexander Courage, Gerald Fried and Fred Steiner.\n\nCDS AVAILABLE THIS WEEK\n\nFear Street Trilogy - Marco Beltrami, Anna Drubich, Brandon Roberts, Marcus Trumpp\n\nA Fistful of Dollars - Ennio Morricone - Beat\n\nThe Golden Age of Science-Fiction Vol. 5 - Raoul Kraushaar, Elisabeth Lutyens - Dragon's Domain\n\nLa pistole non discutono (Bullets Don't Argue) - Ennio Morricone - Beat\n\nMusic from Classic Western Soundtracks - Chuck Cirino, Jim Cox, Lee Holdridge - Buysoundtrax\n\nNightmare Castle - Ennio Morricone - Beat\n\nPapillon [reissue] - Jerry Goldsmith - Quartet\n\nStar Trek - The Original Series - The 1701 Collection, Vol. 6 - Alexander Courage, George Duning, Jerry Fielding, Gerald Fried, Smauel Matlovsky, Fred Steiner - La-La Land\n\nThe latest releases from Buysoundtrax and their related labels are - FALLEN ANGELS VOL. 1, featuring episode cues from the 1990s noir anthology TV series, scored by Peter Bernstein (this volume covers the entire six-episode first season, with episodes helmed by Tom Cruise, Alfonso Cuaron, Tom Hanks, Phil Joanou, Jonathan Kaplan, and Steven Soderbergh); THE GERALD FRIED COLLECTION VOL. 2, featuring the Emmy-winning/Oscar-nominated composer's music for the 1979 film of Sylvia Plath's classic novel The Bell Jar, and the 1976 action thriller Vigilante Force; and Kevin Kiner's score for the 1999 Showtime movie SAFE HOUSE (no relation to the Denzel Washington/Ryan Reynolds vehicle), starring Patrick Stewart.\n\nIn a recent column I listed Anthony Willis's score for 2023's SALTBURN as a new CD release. I just received my copy from Amazon, and despite what the Amazon site had implied, the CD is entirely a song album with none of Willis's score. (his score is available on LP, for those who are interested).\n\nA few weeks ago Andrew McCarthy’s “Brats” documentary was released, profiling the at-times frustrating career trajectories of members of the ‘80s “Brat Pack.” That unofficial “gang” of rising stars found themselves being shut out of projects due to their “membership” in the Pack, though debate remains over what stars and movies are part of the list. Though not a film that’s usually associated with the Brat Pack, the 1983 Orion comedy CLASS (94 mins., 1983, R; MGM) was released right before the John Hughes teen era began, and offers a fascinating list of young and future ‘80s stars right on the cusp of stardom: Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, John Cusack, Alan Ruck, Casey Siemaszko, Virginia Madsen, Joan Cusack, and Lolita Davidovich all appear in this highly uneven, yet undeniably entertaining, mix of high school comedy and coming-of-age drama. The soundtrack world was saddened this week to learn of the passing of Douglass Fake (1952-2024). Fake founded the Intrada label in 1985, their first release an LP of Basil Poledouris' score for the original Red Dawn, and in the nearly 40 years since, he and his label released a treasure trove of film music on CD. While the label is probably most associated with Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton and Basil Poledouris, their catalog encompasses nearly every major composer in English-language cinema, including such current A-listers as Danny Elfman, Michael Giacchino, Thomas Newman, John Powell, Alan Silvestri and Hans Zimmer. One of the many wonderful things about Doug and his label was their genuine enthusiasm for all the composers they worked with and the scores they released. They have also produced expert film music re-recordings, and just this week their Kickstarter campaign to re-record Frank Skinner's Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein reached its funding goal.\n\nOur condolences to Fake's family and his Intrada colleagues. The label's website has a fitting and detailed tribute to Doug at this link.\n\nOn a personal note, I first met Doug in 1980, when he was selling soundtrack LPs out of what was otherwise a movie memorabilia shop called CineMonde on Vallejo Street in San Francisco (in a location that is now a pilates studio). I was there with a friend to shop for movie posters and lobby cards, so finding Doug and his LPs there must rank as one of the most momentous accidental discoveries of my life. I bought my first \"expensive soundtrack\" there (an innocent time when a $15 Japanese import LP of Game of Death could count as \"expensive\") and remained a loyal customer ever since - until their business moved from San Francisco to Oakland, a trip to their store was always my first priority when I would visit the Bay Area after moving to Los Angeles in 1982. I was also lucky enough to able to contribute liner notes to some of their releases, an opportunity for which I will always be grateful. Doug will always be one of the true heroes of the soundtrack world, a genuinely nice man whose work enriched the lives of film music lovers around the world. (For the record, my personal favorite Intrada release is probably their two-disc edition of Goldsmith's remarkable Alien, but there are countless other spectacular and treasured releases to choose from.)\n\nGuiseppe Tornatore’s ENNIO (156 mins., 2021; Music Box) has at last reached the shores of the U.S. after having been released elsewhere around the world over the last couple of years. So what took this terrific documentary so long to find a U.S. distributor? One wonders, since Morricone’s legacy – a list of literally hundreds of movie soundtracks and concert works, plus a massive influence on both Italian and worldwide pop music that came before them – spans decades of popular film scores, some of which transcended the cinematic creations they originally accompanied. The latest release from Intrada is a re-recording of some of Jerry Goldsmith's earliest works, episode scores for the TV anthology series GENERAL ELECTRIC THEATER, which aired from 1953 to 1962. Leigh Phillips conducts this recording with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, with the scores dating back to as early as 1959. The collection also includes \"Autumn Love,\" a suite Goldsmith composed for the CBS Music Library.\n\nCDS AVAILABLE THIS WEEK\n\nThe Dead Don't Hurt - Viggo Mortensen - Milan\n\nEye of the Needle: The Deluxe Edition - Miklos Rozsa - Varese Sarabande CD Club\n\nFor Love of the Game: The Deluxe Edition - Basil Poledouris - Varese Sarabande CD Club\n\nIl cittadino si ribella - Guido & Maurizio De Angelis - Digitmovies\n\nJerry Goldsmith at the General Electric Theater [re-recording] - Jerry Goldsmith - Intrada\n\nLacrima Movies Trilogy - Franco Micalizzi - Digitmovies\n\nLast Action Hero - Michael Kamen - La-La Land\n\nStelvio Cipriani Soundtracks Rarities Vol. 1 - Stelvio Cipriani - Digitmovies\n\nIN THEATERS TODAY\n\nDandelion - Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner\n\nFly Me to the Moon - Daniel Pemberton\n\nHow to Come Alive With Norman Mailer - Jacques Brautbar\n\nLonglegs - Zilgi\n\nLumina - Gino McKoy, Matthew Sargent\n\nMother, Couch - Christopher Bear\n\nNational Anthem - Nick Urata\n\nThe Nature of Love - Emile Sornin\n\nSing Sing - Bryce Dessner\n\nSkywalkers: A Love Story - Jacques Brautbar\n\nTouch - Hogni Egilsson"
