        "text": "Having already ploughed our way through the best new series, funniest films, browsed the offerings of the new streaming service Disney Plus and learned a whole lot from unmissable documentaries since the days have started getting shorter, we're taking a new approach.\n\nCombining our love for TV and music along with the cosy colder months, why not revisit or watch for the first time a series which is acclaimed for its soulful soundtrack among other credentials?\n\nWe can even perhaps ignore cheesy acting or questionable plot twists, if we focus on the music alone (though many of our recommendations below are incredible TV viewing, music aside).\n\nHere are ELLE UK's favourite TV shows with incredible soundtracks. Even if you've watched the below before (or 12 times from start to finish in the case of Friends), try re-watching them now through the lens of their musical offerings...\n\nWe should be feeling like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day every time those first few chords of Harry Nilson’s Gotta Get Up restart in this show, yet we’re somehow still tempted to set it as our alarm – a catchy song for a binge-worthy series. Not only did this show get us through lockdown, perhaps partly because we sympathised with our fiery protagonist (played by Natasha Lyonne) living the same day over and over, but it also introduced us to some truly phenomenal tracks. Our faves are 'I Go To Sleep' from the queen of cover songs Anika, the delicate vocals of ALA.NI in 'Cherry Blossom', and the haunting 'Alone Again Or' by the psychedelic rock band Love.\n\nDavid E. Kelley’sBig Little Lies was not only fantastic viewing but became one of the most streamed playlists on our Spotify when it first hit screens in 2017.\n\nWhen the opening titles rolled with Michael Kiwanuka’s 'Cold Little Heart', we knew this was one to watch. And, when Madeline’s (Reese Witherspoon) daughter Chloe had better music taste than us, as a six-year-old, it was a done deal. Leon Bridges, Sade, Charles Bradley, Elvis, Otis Redding, Frank Ocean… need we go on?\n\nWith a soundtrack as eclectic as Chuck Bass’s fashion sense, Gossip Girl knew how to highlight a moment via music. The very opening scene made the soundtrack instantly exemplary, with Serena’s return to NYC marked by Peter Bjorn and John’s 'Young Folks'.\n\nWho could forget the gorgeous Gare du Nord scene when Blair rescues a lost Chuck from Paris, heightened thanks to Sia’s 'I’m In Here'. Or Sohodoll’s 'Stripper' when the pop-culture famous couple first got together during a night out.\n\nIntertwined with addictive drama was song after song: The XX, Lana Del Ray, Janelle Monae, Goyte, Sum 41, Robyn… and, of course, the show also housed music from their very own Jenny Humphrey, aka Taylor Momsen’s band The Pretty Reckless."
