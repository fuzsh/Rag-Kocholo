        "text": "Cue sheets for silent films were not widely used until the 1920s. The composer Ernst Luz was a prolific compiler of music for cue sheets, and many of the cue sheets in the Library's collections bear his handiwork. Many of the cue sheets in the Music Division's collections also include annotations from performances, giving some information as to how they may have actually been used in accompanying silent films.\n\nYou can also browse silent film music cue sheets using the \"Cue sheets (Music)\" subject heading.\n\nPhotoplay albums were published through a variety of methods. Some were published individually, as quasi-serialized runs that may or may not have been numbered sequentially. Items published individually within a series publication have been cataloged individually. Other photoplay series were published in single albums of a few or over 600 short pieces, and their cataloging provides the titles of individual pieces when the number of pieces is not prohibitive.\n\nThe following titles offer a representative sample and link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. Links to additional online content are included when available.\n\nA great deal of published music, although not published specifically for silent film accompaniment, was used by performers and conductors for that very use. One of the largest genres frequently employed is often referred to as \"salon orchestra music.\" These scores are primarily compositions and arrangements for reduced orchestra, most often found under the M1350 classification. The Library holds thousands of these works, which span from the 19th and well into the 20th centuries.\n\nPublisher series such as G. Schirmer's Galaxy Series or Jungnickel's Artist's Orchestra Repertoire, which were often used for silent film accompaniment, can be found under M1350. But only a relatively small portion of these scores are fully cataloged in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. The vast majority are organized by the composer's - and occasionally arranger's - last name.\n\nScores from the M1350 class are not included in the Silent Film Scores and Arrangements digital collection. Researchers with more questions about locating pieces under this call number should contact the Music Division using Ask A Librarian.\n\nThe following titles offer a representative sample and link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog.
