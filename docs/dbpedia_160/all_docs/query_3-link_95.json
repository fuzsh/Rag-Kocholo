        "text": "Opera usually differs to Musical theatre in that opera has a story that is nearly all sung. This sung dialogue is called a libretto. In Musical theatre the story itself is not always delivered in song; often the songs are comments upon what is happening, providing additional insight into how a character is feeling or exploring a theme of the piece. Spoken dialogue is used alongside song and dance. Occasionally the songs themselves can be âspokenâ. A famous example of this would be the character of Henry Higgins who âspeaksâ his songs in the musical, My Fair Lady, which is based on George Bernard Shawâs play, Pygmalion. Although this was mainly due to the fact that Rex Harrison, the actor who portrayed Higgins on stage and in the 1964 film wasnât a singer!"
