        "text": "You probably know more opera music than you think you do. If you like to watch TV or go to the movies, you’ve undoubtedly heard music from operas used in ways the original composers could never have even imagined. We’ve raided the Seattle Opera archives to put together a playlist featuring some of opera’s greatest hits—tunes you may already know because you’ve heard them in the cinema.\n\n#1: From Apocalypse Now: Ride of the Valkyries (Die Walküre)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola used the “Ride of the Valkyries,” famous music from the second opera of the Ring cycle, not for Wagner’s Norse goddesses of death but for American helicopters dealing out death from above in Vietnam in Apocalypse Now. It made for a brilliant, chilling moment—opera music used not just for emotional effect but as part of a film’s story.\n\nSung by Wendy Bryn Harmer, Jessica Klein, Suzanne Hendrix, Luretta Bybee, Tamara Mancini, Sarah Heltzel, Renée Tatum, and Cecelia Hall, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Asher Fisch.\n\n#2: From Sex and the City: Flower Duet (Lakmé)\n\nThe Lakmé Flower Duet has been used in Sex in the City, Laura Croft Tomb Raider, even the Quentin Tarantino film True Romance. Its sensual blending of female voices powerfully underscored a sexual tryst between two lady vampires, Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon, in the horror movie The Hunger.\n\nSung by Joan Sutherland and Huguette Tourangeau, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge.\n\n#3: From The King’s Speech: Overture to The Marriage of Figaro\n\nMozart’s whirligig overture to the beloved grandaddy of all opera comedies has been used by everybody from Schwarzenegger to Seinfeld to Mad Men. In the Colin Firth film The King’s Speech, speech pathologist Geoffrey Rush played this music to distract his patient, King George VI of England, from the ghastly sound of his own voice.\n\nPlayed by the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Dean Williamson.\n\n#4: From A Night at the Opera: Anvil Chorus (Il trovatore)\n\nOne of the Marx Brothers’ greatest comedies used the pretensions of opera-goers—and the complications of one of opera’s most Romantic plots, Il trovatore—to hilarious effect. The noisy effect of the anvil-banging just makes this familiar music that much sillier.\n\nPerformed by the Seattle Opera Chorus and Orchestra, conducted by Yves Abel.\n\n#5: From A Room with a View: “O mio babbino caro” (Gianni Schicchi)\n\nMovies love that big, lush sound of Romantic Italian opera music. Who could forget the spellbinding beauty of the aria “O mio babbino caro,” from Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi, as heard when a repressed girl from Edwardian England learns about passion while on holiday in Tuscany in the beloved Merchant-Ivory romantic comedy A Room with a View?\n\nSung by Cynthia Haymon, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Cal Stewart Kellog.\n\n#6: From The Fifth Element: Mad Scene from Lucia di Lammermoor\n\nDon’t worry, we haven’t forgotten about action movies and sci-fi. Fans of the Bruce Willis film The Fifth Element may remember the alien Plavalaguna, who is hiding the Fifth Element—and who performs her own riff on the famous mad scene from Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor.\n\nSung by Aleksandra Kurzak, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Bruno Cinquegrani.\n\n#7: From The Witches of Eastwick: “Nessun dorma” (Turandot)\n\nJack Nicholson, as the devil Daryl van Horne, creeped us out in The Witches of Eastwick to the sound of an unforgettable Puccini melody: “Nessun dorma” from Turandot, which became one of the most famous arias in all of opera when Luciano Pavarotti made it his theme song. Start at :50 for the most recognizable part of this piece.\n\nSung by Antonello Palombi, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Asher Fisch.\n\n#8: From Driving Miss Daisy: Song to the Moon (Rusalka)\n\nJust as Pavarotti became associated with “Nessun dorma,” Renee Fleming has been a champion of the beautiful Song to the Moon from Dvorak’s Rusalka. Not many people in America knew how gorgeous that opera is until Ms. Fleming started singing it—beginning with her Seattle debut in 1990. This wistfully beautiful aria featured in the popular movie Driving Miss Daisy.\n\nSung by Renee Fleming, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Bruce Ferden.\n\n#9: From The Shawshank Redemption: Letter Duet (The Marriage of Figaro)\n\nIn the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption, convict Tim Robbins seizes control of his prison’s PA system and plays this wonderful music by Mozart for all his fellow prisoners, including Morgan Freeman, who has this to say about it: “I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. ... I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words. ... those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. ... For the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free.”\n\nSung by Bernarda Bobro and Nuccia Focile, with the Seattle Opera Orchestra conducted by Gary Thor Wedow.\n\n#10: From Pretty Woman: “Sempre libera” (La traviata)\n\nTo conclude our celebration of opera music in the movies, here’s one that gets at the heart of the glamor and passion that opera represents: Pretty Woman, starring Julia Roberts. This movie is a Cinderella-story, about a downtrodden gal who gets one shot at attending the prince’s ball—in this case, Richard Gere hires her to be his date for an opera. Of course he takes her to La traviata, the ultimate opera about a woman who gets paid to entertain men. And what she hears there changes her world.\n\nSung by Dana Pundt, with the orchestra of the Seattle Opera Young Artists Program conducted by Brian Garman."
