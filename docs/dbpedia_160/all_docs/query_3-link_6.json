        "text": "This article is more than 5 years old.\n\nWhy do so many current TV shows have background music so loud it drowns out the dialogue? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\n\nAnswer by Laurence Shanet, Director of TV, Films, Commercials, on Quora:\n\nAs many of the existing excellent answers have already covered in pieces, there are a few different things that may be at work here, some of which you can address and others which you can't.\n\nThe actual audio mixers of the TV shows: AsKenneth van der Walt so insightfully mentioned, the audio mixer(s), director, editor, composer, sound designer and other creative personnel involved with doing the final mix of the show have already heard the dialogue dozens (and maybe hundreds) of times. Further, they've also read the script many times. So they know what the characters are saying. This makes it much easier for them to understand the dialogue even when the relative levels are too low for a novel viewer to understand. It's basically a function of the nervous system and how you process language and sound.\n\nWhat the soundtrack is trying to accomplish: When they do a sound mix, the artists mentioned are mostly concerned with things like emotion and action, and keeping things dynamic. So they tend to err on the side of emphasizing sound effects, music and all the non-dialogue elements of the soundtrack.\n\nThe time frame: TV production tends to be very rushed compared to feature films, and they often spend less time perfecting the dialogue's equalization. This can become even more complicated by the fact that they are often using \"ADR\".\n\nADR: This stands for \"automated dialogue replacement', \"additional dialogue replacement\", or \"additional dialogue recording\", depending on whom you ask. Basically they have the actors record a lot of the lines of dialogue in a studio after the actual shoot in case they need to replace any of it during the edit. In TV, this is done more hastily than in films, and isn't always finessed. Also, it makes the overall dialogue sequence uneven and hard to mix so that it all sounds like one smooth thing. Sometimes the difficulty in hearing things comes from them trying to smooth out this patchwork quilt of sound and hide the edits.\n\nYour TV and sound system: Every television has different speakers of different quality geared towards reproducing different kinds of sounds. And if you use a home theater audio system, this is another variable in what you hear. The audio mix is optimized to a totally different set of equipment than than you are listening on. And how you've adjusted your system can affect how easy or hard it is to hear the dialogue.\n\nYour speaker arrangement: Though it's part of the sound system mentioned above, it bears calling out on its own. Modern sound mixes are designed to be heard on surround sound systems that feature anywhere from 4 to 12 speakers. Each of those components have a different part of the sound range they are responsible for, and their relative balance is important. In a system designed for surround sound, the absence or incorrect integration of a central sound bar can make the dialogue much harder to hear, as can listening to it without the system type the mix was designed for.\n\nYour seating position:Audio systems are made to be listened to from a specific position for optimal performance. Speakers can be focused on a specific area and tuned to a room.\n\nYour own hearing:We all have different hearing ability just as we all have different eyesight. Some people pick up different parts of the sonic range better than others. Also, as we get older, and as the instrument that is our ears gets used and abused over time, the ability to hear the higher end of the range diminishes and the lower/bass end can feel emphasized. This bass end is more likely to be part of the music or sound effects than dialogue, and parts of the sonic components of dialogue can be lost.\n\nYour settings:Your TV, cable/satellite box, receiver, and each element of your audio system all have their own settings. Because there are so many options, one may override or cancel out some of the others, resulting in a less than optimal mix.\n\nSo what can you do? Most of these things, especially the sound mix itself, are out of your control. But there are a few things you can look into to help your plight. It may not fix every show, and you may have to make different adjustments for different programs, but you can at least try some of these measures:\n\nTry adjusting the audio settings on your TV (if that is the main set of speakers that you listen on). Your TV will probably have various options for tweaking the audio in its menus. Some have presets for different types of viewing (sports, talk, movie, etc.). Some allow you to directly play with the dynamic range and emphasize different parts. You may also want to try different modes, such as turning surround off, or going with simple stereo or mono to get everything on fewer channels. Some even have options for emphasizing dialogue. Explore the internal audio menus, and don't even worry about what the menu says they're for. Try them all. Presets especially don't always do what they say, but they usually do something. Also, resist the temptation to turn the overall volume way up. The louder you turn up your the sound to try and hear it, the more it's likely to distort over your TV's speakers, which usually aren't as capable of handling loud sounds as a stereo system's.\n\nTry adjusting the audio settings on your source (the cable, satellite, or digital receiver) menu. There are sometimes options on this component that emphasize different parts of the audio range, just like those on your TV. Again, regardless of what they say they are designed for (sports, movies, etc.), try them all and see which one works best for you. If the source is providing limited or crappy sound, it doesn't matter what your TV or sound system are doing; they can only use the signal they're given.\n\nAdjust your home theater or sound system or change speakers. Same idea as the above two things, but there will be more options here. If you don't have a home theater or sound system, consider adding one. Your electronics store can point you at ones that help emphasize soundtrack dialogue. Conversely, if you currently use a sound system, consider turning it off and listening only to the television speakers. Sometimes by narrowing the range of available sounds you can de-emphasize the music and SFX. It's about finding a way to optimize the soundtrack for your hearing.\n\nAdd a sound bar. If you don't have one already, you can often add a sound bar to a TV's built-in sound system, and you can almost always add one to a separate sound system. Modern mixes are made to play the dialogue over this channel, and if you don't have one, that could be part of the problem. On some you can control the volume of this element separately and boost the dialogue till it's as high as you like.\n\nIf all of those things don't help at all, you can consider adding a graphic equalizer to your system. A multi-channel graphic equalizer can allow you to boost specific frequencies of sound and lower others, so you can boost what you want to hear. They're often not very expensive if you already have a sound system.\n\nTry headphones. This may be a last resort, but you and your husband may have better luck understanding dialogue over headphones. They can eliminate outside sounds that make things harder to hear, and they distort less at high volumes than room speakers do.\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
