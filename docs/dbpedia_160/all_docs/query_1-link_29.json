        "text": "Absurdism\n\nSee Theatre of the Absurd.\n\nAfrican American Theatre\n\nAfrican American theatre refers to theatrical productions created by and featuring African American people. It has a rich and complex history that dates back to the early 19th century when African American actors first began performing on stage in the United States.\n\nTheatre played an important role in the African American community during the period of slavery, as it was one of the few forms of entertainment and self-expression available to enslaved people. In the decades following the Civil War, African American theatre flourished, with black-owned and operated theatre companies springing up in major cities across the United States.\n\nDuring the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, African American theatre experienced a resurgence, with playwrights and performers exploring issues of race, identity, and culture in their work. Since then, African American theatre has continued to thrive, with productions ranging from classic plays by August Wilson and Lorraine Hansberry to contemporary works that explore a wide range of themes and issues affecting the black community.\n\nAgitprop Theatre\n\nAgitprop theatre, originating in the early 20th century, is a form of political propaganda theatre that emerged in the Soviet Union, specifically designed to agitate and propagate the ideals of communism. The term itself is a portmanteau of “agitation” and “propaganda,” reflecting its dual purpose of rousing the audience to a specific political cause while educating them about the ideology behind it. This genre of theatre was developed during a tumultuous period marked by the Russian Revolution of 1917, serving as a tool for the Bolsheviks to communicate and promote their revolutionary ideas to the masses. Agitprop theatre groups, often mobile, utilised simple and direct messages, engaging with audiences in public spaces such as streets, factories, and farms, aiming to make political messages as accessible and influential as possible.\n\nThe characteristics of agitprop theatre are distinct in their simplicity, directness, and integration of various performance elements. Performances are typically short, precise in their message, and designed to be easily understandable to people of all educational backgrounds. Humour and satire are typical, making the content relatable and engaging. Visually, agitprop theatre relies on minimalistic sets and costumes, emphasising the message over theatrical aesthetics. Music and songs often reinforce the themes and messages, making them memorable to the audience. The participatory nature of agitprop performances encourages the audience to engage actively with the content, blurring the lines between performers and spectators and fostering a sense of community and collective action towards the promoted cause.\n\nExamples of agitprop theatre can be found globally, adapting to the political and social contexts of different times and places. In the Soviet Union, the Blue Blouse troupes were among the most famous, performing sketches and scenes that depicted socialist achievements and criticised capitalist systems. Beyond the Soviet borders, agitprop theatre found resonance in various social movements throughout the 20th century, including in the United States during the Great Depression, with groups like the Federal Theatre Project incorporating elements of agitprop into their productions to address social and economic injustices. In more recent times, agitprop theatre has evolved to include digital media, but its essence remains the same: to use performance as a means of political engagement, education, and transformation.\n\nAllegorical Drama\n\nCommonplace during the Middle Ages, allegorical dramas used symbolic characters such as Faith, Hope, Charity, Pride, Envy, or Sloth, to represent abstract concepts, virtues, or vices, in the process conveying moral and religious messages to the audience. They were often performed in cycles, consisting of a series of plays. Performers included the guilds of craftsmen and tradesmen, who would each be responsible for staging one or more plays in the cycle.\n\nThe allegorical play was an important form of drama in the Middle Ages because it allowed the Church to communicate moral and religious messages to the largely illiterate population. Through the use of allegory, these plays could convey complex theological concepts in a way that was accessible and entertaining for the audience. The most famous example of an allegorical drama is the anonymously written play Everyman (c.1510).\n\nAlternative Theatre\n\nAlternative theatre refers to any form of theatrical production that falls outside of the mainstream, commercial theatre industry. It typically refers to smaller, more experimental, and often more politically or socially engaged productions that challenge the conventions of traditional theatre.\n\nAlternative theatre can take many forms, including performance art, physical theatre, puppetry, devised theatre, and site-specific theatre. These productions may be performed in non-traditional venues, such as warehouses, galleries, or public spaces, and sometimes involve audience participation or interaction. Alternative theatre often explores different forms of expression and challenges the status quo.\n\nAmateur Theatre\n\nSee Community Theatre.\n\nAmerican Realism\n\nAmerican Realism in theatre emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, diverging sharply from the melodramatic productions of its time. This movement, aligning with realism in literature and art, sought to accurately portray everyday life and society’s issues, influenced by significant social changes, industrialisation, and urbanisation in the United States.\n\nPlaywrights and practitioners of American Realism aimed to present human behaviour without embellishment. They provided audiences with a reflective look at their own lives and environments. The works of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen were notably influential, prompting American playwrights to pursue similarly realistic narratives.\n\nThe defining characteristics of American Realism include detailed sets, authentic dialogue, and complex characters accurately mirroring real life on stage. Authenticity in acting was prioritised, focusing on genuine emotion rather than exaggerated theatrics. The themes often revolved around family dynamics, social issues, and moral dilemmas, urging audiences to reflect on their own values. This movement spotlighted the struggles of everyday individuals, especially the working class, addressing poverty, race, and gender inequality and making theatre a medium for social critique.\n\nExamples of American Realism abound with works from renowned playwrights like Eugene O’Neill, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller. O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” delves into family and despair, setting a benchmark for realism in American drama. Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire” and Miller’s “Death of a Salesman” highlight character depth and social critique, becoming cornerstones of American theatre.\n\nApplied Theatre\n\nApplied Theatre is a form of theatre that seeks to use techniques and principles to address social, cultural, and political issues and effect positive change in individuals, communities, and society. It is a practice-oriented field that applies theatrical approaches and methods to non-theatrical settings, such as schools, prisons, hospitals, community centres, and other public spaces.\n\nApplied theatre can include community theatre, theatre in education, theatre for development, and participatory theatre. It can involve various techniques, such as role-play, improvisation, forum theatre, and storytelling. The primary goal of applied theatre is to engage participants in an active and reflective process that leads to personal and social transformation.\n\nApplied theatre can address various issues, including social justice, health, education, environment, and human rights. It can facilitate dialogue and understanding among diverse groups, promote empowerment and agency, and create spaces for marginalized voices to be heard.\n\nAqua Drama\n\nAqua Drama was a form of theatrical entertainment that became popular in the 19th century. It was a type of spectacle that combined drama, music, and water effects, usually performed in a large tank or pool on stage. The performers would act out scenes (which were often naval battles) and perform music while splashing, diving, and swimming in the water.\n\nAqua Drama originated in France in the 1820s and soon became popular in other European countries, particularly in Germany, where it was known as Wasserspiele (water plays). The genre reached its peak of popularity in the mid-19th century, but it gradually declined in the latter half of the century as other forms of entertainment became more popular.\n\nAtellan Farce\n\nAtellan Farce was a form of ancient Roman comedy that originated in the town of Atella, near Naples, Italy, around the 4th century BCE. Atellan Farce was a popular theatrical genre that often involved slapstick humour, physical comedy, and satirical commentary on contemporary society and politics.\n\nThe performances usually featured stock characters such as Maccus, the cunning and mischievous slave; Bucco, the greedy and gluttonous fool; Pappus, the bumbling old man; and Dossennus, the boastful soldier. These characters wore masks and costumes that emphasized their distinguishing traits and provided opportunities for exaggerated gestures and physical comedy.\n\nAtellan Farce often included improvised elements, and actors might use their own experiences and observations to create topical jokes and satirical commentary. The genre was influential in the development of later forms of comedy, including commedia dell’arte in Italy and medieval farce in Europe.\n\nToday, few examples of Atellan Farce survive, but its influence can still be seen in the comedic traditions of theatre and performance around the world.\n\nAutobiographical Play\n\nAn autobiographical play is a theatrical production that tells the story of the playwright’s own life or experiences. It is a genre of theatre that allows playwrights to explore their personal stories, memories, and experiences on stage.\n\nAutobiographical plays often feature the playwright as a character in the story, and they may also include other characters based on real people from the playwright’s life. These plays can range from humorous and lighthearted to serious and emotionally intense, depending on the subject matter and tone of the playwright’s story.\n\nThe use of autobiographical material in theatre can create a powerful connection between the audience and the playwright, as the story being told is often deeply personal and relatable to the audience’s own experiences. Autobiographical plays can also be a powerful tool for social and political commentary, as they can shed light on issues and experiences that may not otherwise be represented in mainstream theatre.\n\nAuto Sacramental\n\nAuto sacramental theatre is a type of Spanish religious drama that originated in the 17th century. It consists of a one-act play that is usually performed during the Corpus Christi celebrations, which commemorate the Catholic belief in the transubstantiation of the Eucharist.\n\nAuto sacramentals typically feature allegorical characters that represent theological concepts, such as Grace, Faith, and Sin. The plays often centre around a conflict between these characters, with the outcome ultimately illustrating a lesson or moral message.\n\nAuto sacramental theatre was popular in Spain during the Baroque period and continued to be performed in Spanish-speaking countries for centuries. The plays were often accompanied by music and dance, and the elaborate costumes and sets were meant to dazzle the audience and enhance the religious experience.\n\nSome of the most famous Spanish playwrights of the auto sacramental genre include Pedro Calderón de la Barca and Lope de Vega.\n\nAvant-Garde Theatre\n\nAvant-garde theatre is a form of experimental theatre that pushes the boundaries of traditional theatrical styles, often in terms of conventions, structure, content, and performance techniques. It emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century as a response to the perceived limitations of naturalistic and realistic theatre.\n\nAvant-garde theatre often seeks to challenge the audience’s expectations and assumptions about theatre, by incorporating unconventional elements such as non-linear narratives, fragmented dialogue, abstract imagery, surrealism, and minimalism. It may also incorporate unconventional performance techniques such as improvisation, audience participation, and multimedia elements.\n\nExamples of avant-garde theatre include the works of playwrights and directors such as Samuel Beckett, Antonin Artaud, Jerzy Grotowski, and Robert Wilson, among others.\n\nBallad Opera\n\nBallad operas were a type of musical play that combined spoken dialogue with songs that were often borrowed from popular folk tunes and given new lyrics to fit the story being told. They typically satirised social and political issues of the day and were known for their comedic and often bawdy nature. One of the most famous examples of a ballad opera is The Beggar’s Opera by John Gay, which premiered in 1728. Bertolt Brecht’s play The Threepenny Opera (1928) is based on this work.\n\nBeijing Opera\n\nBeijing Opera, also known as Peking Opera, is a traditional Chinese theatrical art form that combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. It originated in the late 18th century in the capital city of Peking and quickly became one of China’s most popular forms of entertainment.\n\nBeijing Opera tells stories from Chinese history, folklore, and literature, and features a distinctive style of singing and acting that emphasises the performer’s skill and artistry. The music in Beijing Opera is typically performed on traditional Chinese instruments, such as the erhu, pipa, and bamboo flute, and includes a variety of melodies and rhythms.\n\nThe performers in Beijing Opera wear elaborate costumes and makeup, with different colours and patterns used to indicate the character’s gender, age, and social status. The movements and gestures used in Beijing Opera are highly stylised and symbolic, with each action representing a particular emotion or meaning.\n\nBiographical Play\n\nA biographical play is a form of theatre that tells the story of a person’s life. It usually dramatises key events, experiences, and relationships from the person’s life, and aims to provide a deeper understanding of their character, motivations, and impact on history or society.\n\nBiographical plays can be based on famous individuals, such as political figures, artists, writers, musicians, or scientists, or on less well-known individuals who have made important contributions to their communities or fields of endeavour.\n\nExamples of biographical works include “Hamilton” by Lin-Manuel Miranda, which tells the story of founding father Alexander Hamilton, and “The Lion in Winter” by James Goldman, which focuses on the complex relationship between King Henry II of England and his family.\n\nBiomechanics\n\nBiomechanics for the theatre was spearheaded by Russian theatre director and actor Vsevolod Meyerhold, who studied under the renowned Russian theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski.\n\nMeyerhold was heavily influenced by Stanislavski’s ideas on physical expression and movement. He believed that the body was the primary tool for an actor and that an actor’s movement on stage was essential in conveying the character’s emotions and intentions to the audience. He believed that an actor’s physical movements should be deliberate, precise, and expressive and that the body could be trained to perform these movements with greater ease and grace.\n\nMeyerhold developed a series of exercises and techniques, known as biomechanics, designed to train actors in precise and expressive movements, focusing on body control, balance, coordination, and flexibility. They included movements such as jumps, rolls, and falls, as well as more complex movements such as acrobatics and lifts. Biomechanics has been influential in the development of modern physical theatre.\n\nBlackface Theatre\n\nBlackface theatre was a form of entertainment popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, in which white performers would darken their faces with makeup and caricature stereotypical depictions of Black people. The performances typically included singing, dancing, and comedic sketches, often portraying Black people as lazy, ignorant, and overly emotional.\n\nThe use of blackface in theatre was deeply offensive and harmful to Black people, perpetuating negative stereotypes and reinforcing racial hierarchies. It was also part of a broader cultural trend of racial segregation and discrimination in the United States. Blackface performances have largely disappeared from mainstream entertainment.\n\nBlack Box Theatre\n\nSee Chamber Theatre.\n\nBlack Comedy\n\nA black comedy is a type of comedy that often deals with dark or taboo subject matter such as death, violence, or disease. It is characterised by a humourous or satirical approach to these topics, often using irony, sarcasm, or other forms of dark humour. Black comedies can be found in literature, film, television, and theatre, and they are often used to challenge traditional norms and values or to critique society and its institutions.\n\nBlack Light Theatre\n\nBlack light theatre is a form of theatrical performance that originated in the 1950s in Prague, Czech Republic. It is a type of visual theatre that uses black curtains, a darkened stage, and special UV lighting to create an illusion of objects and performers moving in space without visible support or manipulation.\n\nIn a black light theatre performance, the performers dress in black clothing and use fluorescent props and puppets that glow in the dark under UV light. The UV light makes the props and puppets appear to float and move by themselves, while the performers, who are dressed in black, remain invisible to the audience.\n\nThe performance is accompanied by music, narration, and sound effects to create a magical and surreal atmosphere. Black light theatre is often used to create visual spectacles that are impossible to achieve in traditional theatre and can be used to convey a range of themes, from comedic to serious.\n\nBlack Theatre\n\nBlack theatre refers to the theatrical productions, performances, and plays that are created by and for the Black community, often dealing with themes of Black culture, identity, and experiences. Black theatre emerged as a response to the underrepresentation of Black voices in mainstream theatre and the need for a space where Black artists could tell their own stories.\n\nBlack theatre encompasses a range of styles and genres, from traditional African storytelling and music to contemporary works that incorporate elements of hip-hop, spoken word, and multimedia. It also includes plays and musicals that explore historical events, social issues, and political struggles related to the Black experience.\n\nBlack theatre has played an important role in promoting cultural awareness, social justice, and community building among Black audiences. It has also contributed to the diversity and richness of American theatre.\n\nBook Musical\n\nA book musical is a type of musical theatre production that tells a story through songs, dialogue, and dance. It is called a “book” musical because it has a scripted story or book that forms the basis of the production.\n\nThe songs in a book musical are not standalone pieces but are written specifically for the show and serve to advance the plot or reveal character. A book musical typically consists of well-developed characters with clear motivations and desires. The music, dance, and production design are all integrated to create a cohesive theatrical experience that aims to engage the audience emotionally.\n\nExamples of well-known book musicals include West Side Story, The Sound of Music, Les Misérables, and Hamilton.\n\nBoulevard Drama\n\nThe boulevard drama was a type of theatrical genre that emerged in the 19th century, particularly in France. It was characterized by a highly structured plot that relied on a series of carefully orchestrated revelations and twists, as well as a focus on creating a believable illusion of reality through detailed sets, costumes, and dialogue.\n\nThe term “boulevard” refers to the wide, tree-lined avenues in Paris where many of these plays were first performed. Boulevard dramas were often set in the fashionable, upper-class world of Parisian society, and the plot typically revolved around a central secret or scandal that threatened to disrupt the characters’ lives. The plays often featured a surprise twist at the end, which was designed to provide a satisfying resolution to the story.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of boulevard drama include The Corsican Brothers by Alexandre Dumas, Frou-Frou by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, and The Lady From Maxims by Georges Feydeau. Although the genre was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it eventually fell out of fashion as audiences began to favour more experimental and avant-garde forms of theatre.\n\nBourgeois Drama\n\nBourgeois drama is a type of theatrical genre that emerged in the 19th century and reflects the lives, values, and conflicts of the middle class or bourgeoisie. This form of drama often focuses on interpersonal relationships, family dynamics, and the pursuit of material success and social status.\n\nBourgeois drama typically features characters who are concerned with their social standing and economic well-being. The plays explore the tensions and contradictions that arise when individuals are forced to choose between their personal desires and their obligations to society and their families. Often, the characters in bourgeois dramas struggle with issues such as infidelity, divorce, and social conformity.\n\nHenrik Ibsen’s play “A Doll’s House” and Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard” are excellent examples of bourgeois drama.\n\nBoutique Theatre\n\nSee Intimate Theatre.\n\nBroadway Theatre\n\nWhile not a theatrical genre or style, Broadway theatre refers to theatrical productions that are staged in the commercial theatres located in the Theatre District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nBroadway theatre is often associated with musicals, but it also encompasses non-musical plays, one-person shows, and other types of performances. Broadway shows are known for their high production values, elaborate sets and costumes, and top-notch performers.\n\nTo be considered a Broadway production, a show must be presented in a theatre with a seating capacity of at least 500 and run for a minimum of 8 performances a week for at least 1 week. These productions are typically funded by investors, with the goal of earning a profit by attracting large audiences.\n\nBroadway theatre has a rich history, with its origins dating back to the late 19th century. It has become a cultural institution and a symbol of American theatre, attracting audiences from all over the world.\n\nBunraku\n\nBunraku is a traditional form of Japanese puppet theatre that has been performed for over 400 years.\n\nBunraku puppets are large, about half the size of a human, and are operated by three puppeteers. One puppeteer manipulates the head and right arm, another manipulates the left arm, and a third operates the legs and feet. The puppeteers are dressed in black, and are visible on stage, moving the puppets in unison with the music and the narrator.\n\nBunraku performances typically tell historical or legendary stories, often with themes of love and tragedy. The narration is undertaken by a single person, who speaks all the parts, while a shamisen player provides musical accompaniment.\n\nBurlesque\n\nBurlesque is a form of theatrical entertainment that originated in the 19th century and has undergone several transformations over time. At its core, burlesque is a type of comedy that exaggerates, parodies, or satirises different aspects of popular culture, such as music, dance, theatre, or politics.\n\nIn its early years, burlesque shows were considered somewhat risqué and often featured bawdy humour, scantily clad performers, and sexually suggestive themes. These shows were typically performed in theatres or vaudeville venues and were often accompanied by live music.\n\nButoh\n\nButoh is a type of avant-garde dance and theatre that originated in Japan in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was developed by a group of Japanese artists who were interested in creating a new, experimental form of dance and theatre that rejected traditional forms and techniques.\n\nButoh is characterised by slow, controlled movements, often performed with a hunched or contorted posture. Performers in butoh often wear white body paint or other types of body makeup, which emphasizes their movements and expressions.\n\nThe themes explored in Butoh are often dark and taboo, including death, decay, and other aspects of the human experience that are typically considered uncomfortable or unsettling. Butoh is often described as a way of exploring the depths of the human psyche and expressing emotions that are difficult to put into words.\n\nButoh is a highly improvisational and experimental art form, and its performers often draw on a wide range of influences, including Japanese dance and theatre traditions, as well as contemporary art and culture.\n\nCabaret\n\nA cabaret is a form of live entertainment that features a combination of music, dance, comedy, and drama. It is typically performed in a nightclub or restaurant setting, and the performances are usually intimate, interactive, and often provocative.\n\nCabaret shows often include a variety of acts, such as singers, dancers, comedians, magicians, and other performers. The performances are usually presented in a sequence of short pieces, with each act providing a different type of entertainment.\n\nThe origins of cabaret can be traced back to 19th-century Paris, where it was originally a form of entertainment for wealthy patrons. Over time, cabaret evolved to include a wider range of performers and became popular in other cities around the world.\n\nCabaret Voltaire\n\nCabaret Voltaire was a pioneering artistic movement that emerged in Zurich, Switzerland in 1916, during World War I. It was founded by a group of avant-garde artists, including Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Tristan Tzara, and Marcel Janco, who sought to challenge traditional cultural norms and express their opposition to the war.\n\nCabaret Voltaire quickly became a hub of artistic experimentation, where artists, writers, poets, and musicians would gather to exchange ideas, perform and collaborate on new works. The performances at the Cabaret Voltaire often included poetry readings, music, dance, and experimental theatre, which were designed to provoke and challenge the audience’s perceptions.\n\nCape-and-Sword Play\n\nA cape and sword play, also known as a swashbuckler, is a type of play that typically features heroic and romantic characters engaged in adventurous and daring feats. The term “cape and sword” refers to the costume of the main characters.\n\nCape and sword plays were especially popular in the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe, particularly in France and Spain. These plays typically featured chivalrous knights, daring pirates, and adventurous noblemen engaged in sword fights, rescuing damsels in distress, and performing other daring feats.\n\nChamber Play\n\nA chamber play is a type of play that typically involves a small cast of characters and a relatively small and intimate setting such as a single room or a few interconnected rooms. The term “chamber” refers to the idea of a private space, typically a room within a larger building.\n\nIn a chamber play, the focus is usually on the relationships and interactions between the characters, rather than on elaborate sets or costumes. Because the setting is often limited, the character’s actions and words take on greater importance.\n\nChamber plays have been popular since the early 20th century, particularly in Europe. Some well-known examples of chamber plays include August Strindberg’s Miss Julie, Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, and Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie.\n\nChamber Theatre\n\nChamber Theatre is a form of theatrical performance that takes place in a small, intimate space, often a room or chamber, rather than a large stage. This type of theatre is characterised by its simplicity, minimalism, and focus on character and dialogue.\n\nChamber Theatre is also sometimes called “black box theatre” or “studio theatre,” as it typically takes place in a simple, unadorned black box or studio space with a few basic props and set pieces. This allows the audience to focus on the actors and their performances, as well as the dialogue and story being presented.\n\nThe performances in Chamber Theatre are often highly engaging and immersive, as the close proximity of the audience to the actors creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy. This form of theatre can be used to stage a wide range of productions, from classic plays to experimental works, and can be an effective way to showcase emerging artists and new works in a more intimate setting.\n\nChildren’s Theatre\n\nChildren’s theatre is a form of live theatre that is specifically created and performed for young audiences, typically ranging in age from toddlers to teenagers. The content and style of children’s theatre productions are often tailored to the developmental needs and interests of children, using storytelling, songs, puppetry, and other interactive elements to engage and entertain young viewers.\n\nChildren’s theatre can take many forms, from adaptations of classic fairy tales and children’s books to original works that explore contemporary issues and themes. Productions may be performed in traditional theatre spaces or in alternative venues such as schools, community centres, or parks. Some children’s theatre productions may also incorporate educational elements, such as lessons on history, science, or social skills.\n\nChronicle Play\n\nA chronicle play is a type of historical drama that was popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. It typically presents a dramatised version of a historical event or a series of events, often using verse and prose. The name “chronicle play” comes from the fact that the source material for these plays was often taken from chronicles, or historical accounts, of the period.\n\nChronicle plays were typically characterised by their emphasis on historical accuracy, their use of multiple plotlines, and their incorporation of real-life historical figures into the action. Many chronicle plays also included elements of spectacle, such as elaborate stage effects and large-scale battles.\n\nSome well-known examples of chronicle plays include Shakespeare’s “Henry IV” and “Henry V,” Marlowe’s “Edward II,” and Middleton’s “A Game at Chess.”\n\nChristmas Pageant\n\nSee Nativity Play.\n\nChuanqi\n\nChuanqi is a genre of Chinese theatrical drama that was popular during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

The plays typically included lively and colourful characters, witty dialogue, and often featured elements of satire, poking fun at the follies and pretensions of the city’s inhabitants.\n\nCity comedies were an important form of entertainment during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, and many of the great playwrights of the time, such as Ben Jonson and Thomas Middleton, wrote plays in this genre. The plays were often performed at the city’s many public theatres, such as the Globe and the Rose, and were popular with audiences of all social classes.\n\nClassical Drama\n\nClassical drama refers to a type of theatre that originated in ancient Greece in the 5th century BC and was later adopted by the Romans. It typically involves a performance in which actors portray characters who engage in dialogue, often in verse or poetry, and enact a plot that follows a strict structure and set of conventions.\n\nClassical drama is characterised by its adherence to formalized rules and techniques, including the use of a chorus, a group of actors who provide commentary on the action, and the strict observance of the three unities: time, place, and action. These unities dictate that the action of the play should take place in a single location, over a short period of time, and should have a single, unified plot.\n\nClassical drama often deals with themes that are universal and timeless, such as love, power, revenge, and tragedy. Some of the most famous works of classical drama include plays by playwrights such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in Greece and by writers such as Plautus and Terence in Rome.\n\nCloset Drama\n\nCloset drama is a type of play that is not intended to be performed on stage but is meant to be read privately. “Closet” in this context refers to a private room, often a study or a small room, where people would go to read or write in solitude. Closet dramas were popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in England and France.\n\nUnlike stage plays, closet dramas are written primarily for the reader, not the audience. They often contain long soliloquies, philosophical reflections, and complex language that would be difficult to convey on stage. Closet dramas also tend to have a more literary style, with elaborate imagery and metaphors.\n\nFamous examples of closet dramas include John Milton’s Samson Agonistes, Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, and Lord Byron’s Manfred. While these plays were not originally intended for performance, some have been adapted for the stage in modern times.\n\nClown Theatre\n\nClown theatre is a genre of theatrical performance that emphasizes physical comedy, absurdity, and audience engagement. It typically features one or more performers, known as clowns, who use a range of theatrical techniques to entertain and engage the audience.\n\nIn clown theatre, the performers often wear brightly coloured costumes, exaggerated makeup, and other visual elements that accentuate their physicality and presence on stage. They may use props, music, and other elements of physical comedy to create a lively and engaging performance that combines humour, spectacle, and improvisation.\n\nOne of the defining features of clown theatre is its focus on direct audience interaction. The performers may address the audience directly, involve audience members in the performance, or even invite them onto the stage to participate in the show. This creates a sense of intimacy and connection between the performers and the audience, and can make for a highly memorable and engaging theatrical experience.\n\nCollage Drama\n\nCollage drama is a type of theatre that uses a montage or collage of different elements, such as dialogue, music, movement, and visual imagery, to create a theatrical experience. This form of theatre typically employs non-linear storytelling and often incorporates multimedia elements, such as video projections or audio recordings.\n\nIn collage drama, the various elements are juxtaposed and overlaid to create a larger thematic whole. This can involve the integration of different historical or cultural perspectives, as well as the exploration of multiple viewpoints on a particular topic or issue.\n\nCollage drama is often associated with experimental theatre and is used by playwrights and directors as a way to challenge traditional notions of narrative structure and character development. It can be a powerful tool for exploring complex or controversial topics, as it allows for a more free-flowing and non-prescriptive approach to storytelling.\n\nComedia Nueva\n\nComedia nueva, also known as the “New Comedy,” was a theatrical genre that emerged in Spain in the late 18th century. It was characterized by a focus on realism, everyday characters, and contemporary themes, in contrast to the more formal and stylized dramas that had dominated Spanish theatre in the preceding centuries.\n\nThe origins of comedia nueva can be traced back to the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, science, and empirical observation. The playwrights of this period sought to create works that reflected the changing social and political landscape of Spain, as well as the new ideas and values of the Enlightenment.\n\nOne of the most important figures in the development of comedia nueva was Leandro Fernández de Moratín, who wrote plays such as “El sí de las niñas” (“The Maiden’s Consent”) and “La comedia nueva” (“The New Comedy”). These works were notable for their wit, humour, and realistic portrayal of everyday life.\n\nComedia nueva was also characterised by a focus on language and dialogue, with playwrights seeking to create naturalistic and authentic speech patterns for their characters. This often involved incorporating colloquialisms and regional dialects into the dialogue, as well as exploring the nuances of social interaction and interpersonal relationships.\n\nComedy\n\nComedy in the context of theatre refers to a type of performance that is intended to make the audience laugh or find humour in the situation or dialogue presented on stage. Comedy is a genre of dramatic art that typically features amusing or ridiculous situations, humorous dialogue, and exaggerated characters.\n\nComedy can take many forms, from slapstick and physical humour to witty wordplay and satire. Some comedies are structured as farces or comedies of errors, where misunderstandings and miscommunications lead to chaotic and humorous situations. Other comedies may focus on social or political satire, using humour to comment on contemporary issues and critique societal norms and values.\n\nIn theatre, comedy often involves the use of exaggerated gestures, facial expressions, and vocal inflections to enhance the comedic effect. Actors may also use improvisation and audience interaction to further engage the audience and create a lively and entertaining atmosphere.\n\nComedy of Character\n\nA comedy of character, also known as a character comedy, is a type of theatrical comedy that relies on the unique personalities, traits, and quirks of the characters to create humour. In this type of comedy, the characters’ individual flaws, behaviours, and mannerisms are exaggerated for comedic effect. Comedy is often derived from the clash of different characters with conflicting personalities, or the absurdity of certain traits or actions.\n\nComedies of character were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in French theatre, where the genre was known as “comédie de mœurs” or “comédie de caractère.” Famous examples include Molière’s “The Misanthrope” and “Tartuffe,” which feature exaggerated, larger-than-life characters that are both comical and satirical.\n\nComedy of Humours\n\nA comedy of humours was a popular form of comedy in the theatre in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, particularly in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. It was a type of character-driven comedy that focused on the absurd and exaggerated behaviours of characters, who were defined by their particular “humour” or personality trait.\n\nThe idea of the four humours, or bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile), was a popular concept in medieval and Renaissance medicine. According to this theory, each person had a unique balance of the four humours that determined their physical and mental characteristics.\n\nIn a comedy of humours, the characters were often caricatures, with exaggerated and sometimes ridiculous personalities that were determined by their dominant humour. For example, a character with an excess of black bile might be melancholy and morose, while a character with an excess of yellow bile might be hot-tempered and rash.\n\nThe humour-based characters in a comedy of humours were often involved in intricate plots and subplots that led to misunderstandings, mistaken identities, and other comedic situations. These plays were popular with audiences of the time and were written by playwrights such as Ben Jonson and George Chapman.\n\nComedy of Ideas\n\nA comedy of ideas is a genre of theatre that focuses on exploring and satirizing intellectual or philosophical concepts through humour. The term is often associated with the works of the playwrights of the 18th-century Enlightenment era, such as Moliere, Voltaire, and Beaumarchais.\n\nIn a comedy of ideas, the humour often comes from characters who embody different intellectual positions or beliefs and who engage in witty dialogue, debate, and repartee. These plays often take on weighty subjects such as politics, morality, religion, and society, but do so in a lighthearted and entertaining way.\n\nFor example, Moliere’s play “Tartuffe” satirizes religious hypocrisy and the dangers of blindly following religious leaders, while Voltaire’s “Candide” skewers philosophical optimism and the idea that we live in the “best of all possible worlds.”\n\nComedy of Intrigue\n\nThe Comedy of Intrigue, also known as the Comedy of Machiavellianism, was a popular form of comedy in theatre that emerged in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. This genre of comedy is characterized by its focus on political power struggles, cunning scheming, and deceitful manipulation.\n\nIn a Comedy of Intrigue, the plot often revolves around the schemes of a cunning and manipulative character who is trying to gain power or achieve their goals through deceitful means. These characters are usually aristocrats, politicians, or other figures of authority who use their social status and influence to manipulate the other characters in the play.\n\nThe dialogue in a Comedy of Intrigue is often witty and fast-paced, with characters engaging in verbal sparring and clever wordplay to outmaneuver their opponents. The humour in these plays often comes from the absurdity of the situations that arise from the characters’ schemes and the irony of their ultimate failure or comeuppance.\n\nFamous examples of Comedy of Intrigue include William Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure” and “All’s Well That Ends Well”, as well as works by French playwrights Molière and Pierre de Marivaux.\n\nComedy of Manners\n\nComedy of manners (sometimes known as comedy of morals) is a genre of theatrical comedy that became popular in the late 17th century in England. It is characterized by witty dialogue, social satire, and a focus on the manners, social norms, and behaviour of the upper classes. It highlights the absurdity and superficiality of high society while entertaining audiences with clever wit and satire.\n\nComedy of manners often involves a romantic plot and typically features characters who are members of the aristocracy or upper middle class. The humour often arises from the characters’ preoccupation with status, reputation, and etiquette, and their tendency to judge others based on these factors. The characters may also engage in clever wordplay, irony, and sarcasm.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a comedy of manners is Oscar Wilde’s play “The Importance of Being Earnest.” In this play, the character’s preoccupation with social status and the conventions of courtship lead to a series of misunderstandings and comic situations.\n\nCommedia dell’Arte\n\nCommedia dell’arte is a form of improvised theatre that originated in Italy during the 16th century and was popular throughout Europe until the 18th century. The term “commedia dell’arte” literally means “comedy of art,” which reflects the high level of skill and creativity required of the performers.\n\nThe origins of commedia dell’arte are somewhat uncertain, but it is believed to have emerged from a variety of popular theatrical traditions in Italy, including the masked comedies of ancient Rome and the travelling bands of improvisational actors who performed in the piazzas and marketplaces of medieval Italy.\n\nThe first recorded performances of commedia dell’arte date back to the 16th century, when troupes of actors began to perform in the courts of Italian nobles. These early performances were characterized by their use of stock characters, or archetypes, who were recognizable to audiences across Italy. The most famous of these characters include Arlecchino (Harlequin), Pantalone (an old miser), and Pulcinella (a hunchbacked clown).\n\nCommedia dell’arte quickly spread throughout Europe, with troupes of Italian actors touring France, Spain, England, and other countries. As the art form evolved, it became more sophisticated, with actors developing elaborate scenarios and improvising dialogue to suit their characters.\n\nCommunity Theatre\n\nCommunity theatre refers to theatrical performances and productions that are created and performed by members of a community, often for the entertainment and enjoyment of the community itself.

They may include musicals, plays, and other forms of performance art, and can be adapted to suit the interests and abilities of the community members involved.\n\nIn addition to providing entertainment for the community, community theatre can also serve as a valuable outlet for artistic expression and creativity, as well as an opportunity for individuals to develop their skills in theatre production and performance. It can also foster a sense of community spirit and bring people together in a shared experience of creativity and entertainment.\n\nConcept Musical\n\nA concept musical is a type of musical theatre in which the central theme or idea is more important than the plot or character development. The concept is usually a social or political issue, a philosophical or psychological idea, or a visual or musical motif.\n\nIn a concept musical, the storyline is structured around the concept, with the characters and their relationships serving to illustrate or explore it. The music, lyrics, and choreography are often unconventional and experimental, with the aim of enhancing the audience’s emotional and intellectual engagement with the concept.\n\nSome examples of concept musicals include “Hair,” which explores the counterculture and anti-war movement of the 1960s; “A Chorus Line,” which examines the lives of Broadway performers and the struggle to succeed in show business; and “Hamilton,” which uses hip-hop and other musical styles to tell the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and explore themes of immigration, identity, and political power.\n\nContemporary Theatre\n\nContemporary theatre refers to the current state of theatre that reflects the social, cultural, and political issues of our time.

The term derived from the fact that these dramas often depicted characters engaging in tea-drinking ceremonies, which were associated with the genteel and refined aspects of Victorian society.\n\nCup and saucer dramas were known for their emphasis on dialogue and character development, rather than action or plot. They often portrayed complex social dynamics, including romantic entanglements, family conflicts, and struggles for social status or acceptance. The dramas were usually set in middle-class homes or other domestic environments, and the characters were often portrayed as struggling to maintain their social position or reputation.\n\nCup and saucer dramas were a popular genre in the late 19th century, particularly in the UK and the US. They appealed to middle-class audiences who could relate to the characters and their concerns, and who enjoyed the opportunity to see their own lives reflected on stage. Some notable examples of cup and saucer dramas from this period include Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest “and Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House”.\n\nDance Drama\n\nDance drama is a form of theatrical performance that combines elements of dance, music, and drama to tell a story. In this genre, the story is conveyed through movement, facial expressions, and gestures, as well as through spoken dialogue or song.\n\nThe performers in a dance drama typically use choreography to express emotions, actions, and relationships between characters, rather than relying solely on spoken words.

However, while site-specific theatre focuses on the unique qualities of a specific location, environmental theatre is more concerned with creating an immersive experience that transforms the space into a theatrical environment.\n\nEpic Theatre\n\nEpic theatre is a style of theatre developed by Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht in the 1920s and 1930s. It aimed to use the stage as a platform for social and political commentary, often challenging the audience’s assumptions and beliefs.\n\nOne of the key features of epic theatre is the use of techniques that create a sense of distancing, between the audience and the characters on stage. These techniques include breaking the fourth wall, using music and songs to comment on the action, and presenting scenes out of chronological order. By interrupting the natural flow of the play and making the audience aware of the theatrical artifice, epic theatre sought to create a critical and reflective distance that would allow viewers to engage with the performance intellectually rather than emotionally.\n\nBrecht’s epic theatre also frequently employed montage, a technique derived from film editing, in which short, rapid scenes were juxtaposed to create meaning through association. This approach helped to break down the traditional narrative structure of theatre and highlight the social and political forces that shape individual lives.\n\nEquestrian Drama\n\nEquestrian drama is a genre of theatrical performance that involves horses and horse riding as a prominent element of the production. It was popular in the 19th century, particularly in Europe and America, and often featured elaborate stunts and displays of horsemanship.\n\nEquestrian dramas typically featured live horses and riders, who would perform intricate choreography, stunts, and acrobatics on stage. The productions often included colourful costumes, music, and special effects to enhance the spectacle. The stories in equestrian dramas ranged from historical and mythological themes to contemporary tales of adventure and romance.\n\nOne of the most famous equestrian dramas was “The Corsican Brothers,” which premiered in London in 1852. It was based on a novella by Alexandre Dumas and featured a climactic horseback chase scene. Other notable equestrian dramas include “Mazeppa,” “The Black Crook,” and “The Two Orphans.”\n\nEsoteric Theatre\n\nEsoteric theatre is a form of theatre that explores spiritual, mystical, or occult themes and often employs symbolism and metaphor to convey its message. It typically involves performances that are designed to elicit a deeper understanding of the self and the world around us, often incorporating elements of ritual and ceremonial practices.\n\nEsoteric theatre can take many forms, including experimental theatre, performance art, and even traditional theatre productions that incorporate esoteric themes and symbolism. It is often associated with esoteric traditions such as Hermeticism, alchemy, and Gnosticism, as well as with contemporary spiritual movements such as New Age and neo-paganism.\n\nEsoteric theatre can be challenging for audiences who are not familiar with the traditions and symbols being used, as it often requires a degree of prior knowledge and understanding to fully appreciate. However, for those who are interested in exploring deeper spiritual themes and ideas through the medium of the theatre, esoteric theatre can be a powerful and transformative experience.\n\nEthnic Theatre\n\nEthnic theatre refers to theatrical performances, plays, and productions that are created and performed by members of a specific ethnic group or community. The term encompasses a wide range of performances, from traditional folk plays to contemporary productions that explore the experiences and perspectives of different ethnic groups.\n\nEthnic theatre is often used as a means of cultural expression, allowing members of a community to explore and celebrate their cultural identity, history, and traditions. It can also serve as a way to educate others about different cultures and promote cultural understanding and tolerance.\n\nEthnic theatre has a long history, with many traditions and forms of performance originating in specific ethnic communities. For example, the Noh theatre of Japan, the puppet theatre of Indonesia, and the musical theatre of Broadway are all examples of ethnic theatre.\n\nEthnographic Theatre\n\nEthnographic theatre is a form of theatre that seeks to represent and interpret the customs, beliefs, and practices of a particular culture or community. It is a type of performance art that often involves the use of storytelling, music, dance, and other traditional art forms to create a rich and immersive experience for the audience.\n\nEthnographic theatre emerged in the mid-20th century as a way to bridge the gap between cultures and promote cross-cultural understanding. It is often associated with the work of anthropologists and other social scientists who seek to document and analyze the cultural practices of different groups.\n\nIn ethnographic theatre, performers may draw on their own personal experiences or those of members of the community they are representing to create a narrative that reflects the beliefs and values of that culture. They may also work closely with members of that community to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of their portrayal.\n\nOne of the key features of ethnographic theatre is its focus on the experiential, rather than simply the intellectual, aspects of culture. This can be seen in the use of music, dance, and other sensory elements to create a more immersive and emotional experience for the audience.\n\nExperimental Theatre\n\nExperimental theatre is a form of theatre that focuses on exploring new and innovative styles of performance, often pushing the boundaries of traditional theatre. It is characterized by a willingness to experiment with unconventional staging techniques, non-linear narratives, abstract themes, and non-traditional casting.\n\nThe primary goal of experimental theatre is to challenge the audience’s preconceptions and assumptions about theatre by presenting them with something unexpected and unique. This can involve breaking down the fourth wall, using multimedia elements like video and sound, or incorporating performance art, dance, and music into the production.\n\nExperimental theatre often emphasizes the process of creating theatre over the final product. It encourages collaboration between actors, directors, designers, and writers to explore new ideas and push the limits of what can be achieved on stage.\n\nExpressionism\n\nExpressionism is a style of theatre that emerged in Germany in the early 20th century, characterized by the distortion of reality and an emphasis on expressing inner emotions and thoughts. In Expressionist theatre, the external world is often depicted as nightmarish or surreal, reflecting the inner turmoil and psychological states of the characters.\n\nSome common features of Expressionist theatre include exaggerated movements and gestures, distorted scenery and props, stylized makeup and costumes, and the use of heightened language or non-realistic dialogue. Expressionist plays often focus on themes of isolation, alienation, and the struggle to find meaning in a chaotic and oppressive world.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of Expressionist theatre is the play “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz, which was adapted into a silent film in 1920. The play and the film use distorted sets and costumes to create a sense of unease and disorientation, reflecting the psychological states of the characters.\n\nOther notable Expressionist playwrights include Georg Kaiser, Ernst Toller, and Bertolt Brecht. While Expressionist theatre was most popular in Germany in the early 20th century, its influence can be seen in later movements such as Surrealism and Absurdism, as well as in contemporary experimental theatre.\n\nFabula\n\nHistorically, “fabula” referred to the plot or story of a play in ancient Greek and Roman theatre. In these early forms of theatre, plays were often based on myths, legends, or historical events, and the fabula was an important element in conveying the message and meaning of the play.\n\nIn Greek theatre, the fabula was known as the “mythos,” and it was typically structured around the traditional three-act structure. The plot was developed through the use of dialogue, choral odes, and action on stage. The fabula was often designed to convey a moral or philosophical message to the audience, and it was considered an essential element of the theatrical experience.\n\nIn Roman theatre, the fabula was similarly important and plays often featured complex plots and intricate character development. Roman playwrights such as Terence and Plautus were known for their mastery of the fabula, and their plays often included elements of comedy, satire, and social commentary.\n\nFantasy\n\nThe fantasy genre in theatre involves creating a fictional world with magical or supernatural elements that do not exist in our reality. In a fantasy play, the characters, settings, and plots often involve mythical creatures, magical powers, and enchanting worlds that are not constrained by the laws of physics or reality.\n\nFantasy plays can be set in any time period or location, and may include characters such as dragons, wizards, fairies, and other magical beings. These characters often have supernatural abilities and powers, and the plots often revolve around quests, battles, and struggles between good and evil.\n\nFantasy plays can be comedic or dramatic, and can explore a wide range of themes and ideas. Some common themes in fantasy plays include the struggle between good and evil, the power of love and friendship, the consequences of greed and ambition, and the importance of courage and perseverance.\n\nIn addition to traditional stage productions, the fantasy genre has also been explored through musicals, puppet shows, and other forms of theatre. A well-known example of a fantasy play is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\n\nFarce\n\nA farce is a type of comedy that emerged in the late 16th century and was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the theatre, a farce is a light, humorous play characterized by exaggerated, improbable situations, physical humour, and broadly-drawn characters. Farces often involve mistaken identity, misunderstandings, and absurd situations that lead to chaotic and comic consequences.\n\nIn a farce, the characters are usually caricatures of real people, and their actions are often exaggerated for comedic effect. Farces often involve rapid dialogue, frantic physical action, and slapstick comedy, with characters running in and out of doors, hiding in closets, and engaging in other forms of physical comedy.\n\nSome famous examples of farces in theatre include Georges Feydeau’s “A Flea in Her Ear,” Michael Frayn’s “Noises Off,” and Richard Bean’s “One Man, Two Guvnors.”\n\nFate Drama\n\nFate drama typically refers to a type of tragedy that explores the role of fate or destiny in human affairs. These dramas often feature characters who are subject to powerful forces beyond their control, such as the gods, supernatural powers, or the workings of fate itself. The outcome of the story is often predetermined, with characters unable to escape their fate despite their efforts to do so.\n\nSome famous examples of fate dramas in theatre include the plays of Sophocles, such as “Oedipus Rex” and “Antigone,” which explore the tragic consequences of human actions in the face of fate. Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” and “Hamlet” also contain elements of fate, with the characters ultimately succumbing to their predetermined destinies despite their efforts to change their paths.\n\nFeminist Theatre\n\nFeminist theatre is a type of theatre that emerged during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s. It is a form of political theatre that seeks to challenge and critique the patriarchal society and the systemic oppression of women.\n\nFeminist theatre aims to give voice to women’s experiences and to raise awareness of issues such as gender inequality, sexism, misogyny, violence against women, and other forms of oppression. It often features female characters in lead roles, and female playwrights, directors, and actors are prominently involved in its creation.\n\nFeminist theatre is characterised by its use of non-traditional performance styles, such as guerrilla theatre, street theatre, and performance art. It often employs experimental techniques such as breaking the fourth wall, using multimedia elements, and incorporating music and dance.\n\nSome notable examples of feminist theatre include works by playwrights such as Caryl Churchill, Eve Ensler, and Maria Irene Fornes. The play “The Vagina Monologues” by Eve Ensler is a particularly well-known example of feminist theatre that has been performed in many countries around the world.\n\nFolk Theatre\n\nFolk theatre, also known as traditional theatre, is a form of theatre that originates from the culture and traditions of a specific region or community. It encompasses a variety of performances including plays, musicals, dance, and puppetry that are based on the customs, beliefs, and values of a particular group of people.\n\nFolk theatre has a long history and can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, where it was used as a means of entertainment and education. In more recent times, folk theatre has been used as a way to preserve cultural heritage and promote community bonding.\n\nSome examples of folk theatre from around the world include Japanese Kabuki, Indian Kathakali, Chinese Opera, Italian Commedia dell’Arte, and African Drumming and Dance. These forms of theatre often feature colourful costumes, lively music, and stylized movements that are characteristic of the region or culture they originate from.\n\nFormalism\n\nFormalism in theatre refers to a style or approach to creating and experiencing theatre that places a high emphasis on form, structure, and technique. In the context of theatre, formalism is often associated with the work of 20th-century avant-garde artists and movements such as the Russian Formalists.\n\nOne of the key principles of formalism in theatre is the idea that the form or structure of a play is just as important, if not more so, than its content or narrative. Formalists often sought to break down traditional narrative structures and explore new ways of organizing and presenting theatrical material. They were also interested in using techniques such as repetition, abstraction, and fragmentation to create a sense of disorientation and challenge audiences to actively engage with the work.\n\nFormalist theatre also tends to be highly self-conscious, drawing attention to the theatricality of the performance and emphasizing the role of the audience as active participants in the creation of meaning.\n\nFormalism in theatre can be seen as a rejection of traditional storytelling conventions and a commitment to exploring new forms and structures that challenge both artists and audiences to think differently about the possibilities of theatre as an art form.\n\nForum Theatre\n\nForum Theatre is a type of interactive theatre developed by Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal in the 1960s. It is a form of theatre that invites the audience to actively participate in the performance, with the aim of promoting social and political change through dialogue and action.\n\nIn Forum Theatre, the actors perform a short play or scene, usually depicting a social or political issue or injustice. The play ends at a crucial point, where the protagonist faces an obstacle or a dilemma. At this point, the audience is invited to suggest different ways in which the story could be continued or resolved.\n\nThe actors then perform the play again, incorporating the audience’s suggestions, and continue until a satisfactory resolution is reached. This process is called “intervention,” and it allows the audience to actively engage with the performance, experimenting with different solutions to the problems presented in the play.\n\nThe goal of Forum Theatre is not only to entertain, but also to provoke critical thinking, discussion, and social action. Through this process, the audience becomes aware of their own agency and the possibility of change, and they are encouraged to take action in their own lives and communities.\n\nForum Theatre is a powerful tool for social and political transformation, as it encourages dialogue, critical thinking, and collective action towards a more just and equitable society.\n\nFrench Farce\n\nFrench farce was a genre of comedic theatre that originated in France in the 16th century and became popular throughout Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is characterized by its use of exaggerated, improbable, and often absurd situations to create humour.\n\nFrench farce typically features a fast-paced plot, with characters engaging in physical comedy, slapstick, and other forms of humour. Mistaken identities, sexual innuendo, and social satire are also common elements of French farce.\n\nOne of the most famous French farce playwrights was Molière, who wrote plays such as “Tartuffe,” “The Misanthrope,” and “The Imaginary Invalid.” His plays often featured exaggerated characters and situations, as well as social commentary on the French aristocracy and religious hypocrisy.\n\nFrench farce continued to be popular in the 19th and 20th centuries, with playwrights such as Georges Feydeau and Jean Anouilh continuing to develop the genre.\n\nFringe Theatre\n\nFringe theatre refers to a type of experimental and alternative theatre that is typically produced outside of mainstream commercial theatre circuits. It is often characterized by its low-budget, avant-garde approach and its willingness to take creative risks and push boundaries.\n\nThe term “fringe” originally referred to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which was established in 1947 as an alternative to the more traditional Edinburgh International Festival. The Fringe quickly became a platform for new and emerging artists to showcase their work, and it has since inspired the development of similar festivals and movements around the world.\n\nFringe theatre often challenges conventional theatrical forms and conventions, and it may incorporate elements of performance art, improvisation, and audience participation. It may also address controversial or taboo subjects and explore social and political issues in unconventional ways.\n\nFringe productions are typically produced on a shoestring budget and may be staged in unconventional performance spaces such as warehouses, pubs, and parks. The focus is often on creativity and experimentation rather than commercial success, and fringe artists may use the platform to develop their skills and gain exposure to new audiences.\n\nFuturist Theatre\n\nFuturism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It was characterized by a focus on technology, speed, and modernity, and a rejection of traditional forms of art and culture. In the realm of theatre, futurism sought to break away from the established conventions of realism and naturalism and instead embraced experimentation, abstraction, and the use of new technology.\n\nFuturist theatre was marked by its use of new and innovative stage designs, lighting effects, and soundscapes. Performances often featured rapid, fragmented scenes that were meant to reflect the fast-paced nature of modern life. Actors were encouraged to break free from traditional styles of performance and instead embrace a more physical, non-naturalistic approach.\n\nFuturism in theatre also embraced a highly political and socially engaged approach. Many futurist plays were overtly political, exploring issues such as nationalism, war, and the role of the individual in society.\n\nDespite its radical nature, futurism in theatre had a significant influence on the development of modern theatre and performance. Its emphasis on experimentation and innovation helped to pave the way for later avant-garde movements such as surrealism and absurdism.\n\nHappening\n\nHappening is an avant-garde theatre movement that emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s, primarily in the United States, under the influence of artists such as Allan Kaprow, who is often credited with coining the term. Happenings were a radical departure from traditional theatre, blurring the distinctions between art and life, performer and audience, and script and improvisation. This movement sought to create an art form that was immediate, interactive, and engaged directly with the realities of the world around it.\n\nThe defining characteristic of a Happening is its emphasis on the experiential aspect of performance, often taking place in unconventional settings like streets, homes, and abandoned buildings rather than traditional theatre spaces. These performances were not meant to be watched passively but experienced actively, with the audience being an integral part of the event. The fluidity of the narrative, the absence of a clear beginning or end, and the incorporation of everyday activities into the performance underscored the Happening’s aim to break down the barriers between art and life.\n\nHappenings were inherently ephemeral and unique, designed to occur only once and never to be replicated in the same way again. This emphasis on impermanence highlighted the movement’s challenge to conventional notions of art as a commodity. The performances often included multimedia elements such as visual art, music, dance, and technology, reflecting the movement’s interdisciplinary nature.\n\nAllan Kaprow’s works, such as “18 Happenings in 6 Parts” (1959), illustrate this movement’s experimental and participatory nature. Other artists associated with the Happening movement include Claes Oldenburg, whose mock store “The Store” (1961) blurred the line between art exhibition and commercial space, and Carolee Schneemann, whose performances explored the body, gender, and sexuality in bold and innovative ways.\n\nHarlequinade\n\nHarlequinade is a theatrical genre rooted in the Italian Commedia dell’arte, flourishing in England from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. Originating from the character Harlequin, a nimble and cunning servant, this genre is marked by its silent mime, slapstick comedy, and elaborate, magical transformations. The essence of Harlequinade lies in the chase and escape antics of Harlequin, often pursuing love with his counterpart, Columbine, while evading the obstacles placed by characters such as Pantaloon and Clown.\n\nThe defining characteristics of Harlequinade include a specific set of characters drawn from Commedia dell’arte, with Harlequin at the centre of the narrative, adorned in a distinctive checkered costume. The genre is notable for its lack of spoken dialogue, relying instead on physical comedy, acrobatics, and visual spectacle to tell its story. This performance style heavily influenced the development of pantomime in Britain, integrating with it to form the ‘panto’ tradition, particularly in its Christmas season performances.\n\nHarlequinade’s popularity peaked in the Victorian era, when it became a significant part of the British theatre scene, often presented as a part of a night’s entertainment that included a pantomime followed by the Harlequinade. John Rich, a prominent figure in 18th-century theatre, is credited with transforming the character of Harlequin into the magical, romantic hero central to the genre. This era saw innovations such as the introduction of the ‘slapstick’—a device that produced a loud slapping noise, symbolising the physical comedy and chaotic energy of the performances.\n\nExamples of works that incorporate elements of Harlequinade include the 19th-century pantomimes and fairy extravaganzas, where magical transformations and mischievous escapades were a staple. Theatre companies specialising in pantomime and traditional British theatre often revive elements of Harlequinade, ensuring its conventions and characters continue to entertain audiences. While the pure form of Harlequinade has declined in modern times, its influence persists in slapstick comedy and whimsical narratives in contemporary theatre and cinema.\n\nHeritage Theatre\n\nHeritage theatre is a type of theatre that seeks to preserve and celebrate the cultural heritage of a particular community or region. It typically involves performances that highlight the history, traditions, and customs of a specific cultural group or location.\n\nHeritage theatre can take many forms, including historical reenactments, traditional dances and music performances, and plays that explore the stories and myths of a particular culture. It is often used as a means of promoting cultural understanding and preserving cultural traditions for future generations.\n\nSome examples of heritage theatre include Native American ceremonial dances, traditional Chinese opera, and historical plays about the founding of a particular city or region. Heritage theatre can be found all over the world, as many cultures have unique performance traditions that reflect their heritage and history.\n\nHeroic Drama\n\nA heroic drama, also known as a heroic tragedy, was a popular genre of theatre during the Restoration period (1660-1688) in England. It typically depicted stories of noble, heroic figures who faced great challenges and tragic endings.\n\nThe plays were characterized by their grandeur, elevated language, and highly emotional scenes. They often featured larger-than-life characters such as kings, queens, princes, and knights, and were set in ancient or exotic locations. The plots usually revolved around themes of love, honour, duty, and sacrifice.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a heroic drama is John Dryden’s play “The Conquest of Granada” (1670), which tells the story of the fall of the Muslim kingdom of Granada to the Christian forces of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. Other notable examples include Thomas Otway’s “Venice Preserved” (1682) and Nathaniel Lee’s “The Rival Queens” (1677).\n\nThe genre fell out of favour in the 18th century, as audiences began to prefer more realistic and less melodramatic plays.\n\nHeroic Tragedy\n\nSee Heroic Drama.\n\nHigh Comedy\n\nHigh comedy is a type of theatrical comedy that is characterized by sophisticated wit, clever wordplay, and intellectual humour. It is often associated with the upper classes and uses elevated language, elaborate metaphors, and references to literature and culture.\n\nHigh comedy is different from low comedy, which relies on physical humour, crude jokes, and slapstick. Instead, high comedy focuses on clever banter and clever repartee between characters, often involving social commentary or satire.\n\nExamples of high comedy in the theatre include plays by Oscar Wilde, such as “The Importance of Being Earnest” and “An Ideal Husband,” as well as works by George Bernard Shaw, such as “Pygmalion” and “Arms and the Man.” These plays use clever wordplay and satire to comment on social norms and expectations and are often performed with a sense of elegance and refinement.\n\nHilarotragedy\n\nA hilarotragedy is a genre of ancient Greek theatre that combines elements of both tragedy and comedy. The term is derived from the Greek words “hilaros” (meaning “cheerful” or “amusing”) and “tragedy” (meaning “goat-song”).\n\nHilarotragedies were typically shorter than full-length tragedies and often had a happy ending. They featured serious themes and characters, but also included comedic elements such as satire and parody. The genre was popular during the 4th century BCE in Athens and was often performed at festivals.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of a hilarotragedy is the play “The Birds” by Aristophanes, which combines serious political and social commentary with whimsical, fantastical elements and comedic dialogue.\n\nHippodrama\n\nA hippodrama was a type of theatrical performance in ancient Greece that combined elements of drama and horse racing. It was a popular form of entertainment in the ancient world, especially in Athens during the 5th century BCE.\n\nIn a hippodrama, the stage was often designed to resemble a racetrack, with chariots and horses racing around it. The actors would perform scenes and interact with the horses and chariots as they raced by, often incorporating stunts and physical feats into their performances.\n\nThe most famous example of a hippodrama is the play “The Persians” by Aeschylus, which was performed in 472 BCE and depicted the Persian defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The play featured a large cast of actors, chariots, and horses, and was performed in the Theater of Dionysus in Athens.\n\nHistorical Theatre\n\nHistorical theatre is a theatrical genre that involves the presentation of plays or performances that are based on historical"
