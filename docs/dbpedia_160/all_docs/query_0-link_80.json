        "text": "Music in crime drama films or audio books serves as a powerful storytelling tool.\n\nAside from setting the staple suspense vibe, it helps by enhancing the visual or spoken narrative, eliciting emotions, and contributing to the overall experience. A crime story just isn’t the same within that thrilling, suspense soundtrack!\n\nHi, I’m Mik, one of TunePocket music composers. I went though our huge catalog of royalty free music and picked some of our best crime drama music tracks filled with cinematic tension or mystery. Watch the video below or jump straight to the playlist.\n\nWhat background music works best in crime drama content?\n\nThe crime drama films, podcasts, and audio books typically revolve around criminal stories, investigations, and the pursuit of justice.\n\nCrime dramas can take various forms, including police and detective stories, heist films, and legal dramas with emphasis on suspense, tension, and intricate plots.\n\nCrime drama music soundtracks commonly feature tense orchestral scores, mysterious underscores, or brooding electronic soundscapes, depending on the film’s setting and style.\n\nHowever, depending on the story line, you may need to use sneaky music for comic crime skits or news broadcast music if your story focuses on the work of police of investigative journalists.\n\nWhen looking for the soundtrack for you next crime drama story, focus the music that delivers tension, suspense, and a dark, brooding atmosphere with mysterious or enigmatic tones.\n\nI’ve listed some examples below:\n\nBest crime drama music for videos, films, podcasts, and audio books\n\nAll crime drama music in this playlist comes with lifetime royalty free music license. Learn how to license music for crime drama videos, films, investigative documentaries, podcasts, and audio books."
