        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions for Institutions\n\nWhat is the Musical Theater Common Prescreen?\n\nThe Musical Theater Common Prescreen is an agreed upon set of criteria used for the videos that are required as part of the application process to musical theater programs. These institutions settled on given guidelines to initiate a streamlined process for both applicants and schools as well as to promote inclusivity in the admittance process.\n\nWho can participate?\n\nAny institution that requires a digital prescreening for applicants may participate in the Musical Theater Common Prescreen. This includes universities, colleges, conservatories (domestic and international), independent schools of theater and theater education programs. Your institution will need to register your options each season so we can update our website. Email us at mtcp@getacceptd.com to receive an updated form.\n\nDo institutions need to utilize an online media platform such as Acceptd or Slate to be part of this initiative?\n\nNo. Participation is voluntary and not dependent on affiliation with any organization. The Musical Theater Common Prescreen is not a centralized online platform. Instead, it is a set of guidelines applied to a program’s existing application process. Each individual institution will continue to receive applications and digital media. Wherever guidelines are listed, schools should state that they are a participant in the Musical Theater Common Prescreen and list the options they have chosen.\n\nIf a program does not use a digital prescreening process, can they be involved?\n\nAny program may utilize the criteria for any number of screening opportunities including digital audition submissions and live auditions. Heads of Department should contact Acceptd (mtcp@getacceptd.com) so their name can be added to the master list for press and distribution and to identify how their program will be using the guidelines.\n\nIs this Common Prescreen linked or associated to the Common App?\n\nNo. The word “common” was utilized to promote inclusivity and to reinforce that one “common” set of guidelines would be recognized amongst various musical theater training programs.\n\nDoes this take the place of or change the criteria for a live audition?\n\nNo. Schools are urged to keep their live audition criteria as specific to their individual program needs as possible. We recognize that the audition process communicates the culture of a school and believe that students can learn greatly about an institution by what is asked of them in their live audition.\n\nWhat does it cost the university to participate in the Musical Theater Common Prescreen?\n\nThere is no fee to the school or to the student. Institutions will continue to set their own individual application fees.\n\nWhat categories of required material does the Musical Theater Common Prescreen cover?\n\nThe MTCP Committee set criteria for “Song”, “Monologue”, “Dance, “Wild Card”, and “Slating” requirements. A resources page of “quick tips” to help applicants was added in 2020.\n\nThere are two options for each category. Do institutions have to choose just one or can we use both?\n\nInstitutions may use one option or allow the student to choose either option.\n\nAre institutions permitted to change and tweak the verbiage in the Musical Theater Common Prescreen?\n\nNo. To be a participant, an institution must utilize verbiage verbatim. The promotion of “common” verbiage is what will create ease of process and discourage confusion and questions."
