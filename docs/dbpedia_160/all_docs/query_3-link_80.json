        "text": "From baseball diamonds to “Bond, James Bond,” Madonna’s film forays include unbridled hits and misguided mishaps. As the Queen of Pop celebrates her 60th birthday on Aug. 16, it’s the perfect time to celebrate her decades in the spotlight.\n\nWe’ve compiled 10 of her biggest movie theme songs that are worth another listen. But remember: “Evita” was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, “Vogue” was a hit single shoehorned onto an album inspired by a movie starring Madonna and “American Pie” was a cover, so none of those high-profile numbers makes this list.\n\nIf you want to party, Valley Bar in downtown Phoenix is throwing a birthday bash in her honor Thursday evening. Here’s hoping some of these timeless tunes will reverberate through the underground venue.\n\nMORE: Essential Madonna: Her 30 best singles of all time\n\n'Into the Groove'\n\nFor \"Desperately Seeking Susan,\" 1985.\n\nIn a crowded club scene in Susan Seidelman’s “Desperately Seeking Susan,” an effervescent and cheese-puff-inhaling Madge sways and seduces a dull hot-tub salesman. This is the quintessential dance-floor meet-up jam when you’re about to finish your second drink and make eyes with a stranger across a sweaty, neon-drenched throng of gyrating bodies. There’s nothing you can do but step to the beat of this uptempo bop.\n\n'Beautiful Stranger'\n\nFor \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" 1999.\n\nFrom its airy psychedelic crescendos to Madonna's capri-covered high kicks, this Sprite green-hued video promoting the second Austin Powers installment reads like an expensive Gap commercial today. However, even in the Instagram age, Madonna’s infatuation with someone easily translates. Today, it’s par for the course to swoon over beautiful strangers who can make your world come tumbling down with just one look in their eyes.\n\n'Crazy for You'\n\nFor \"Vision Quest,\" 1985.\n\nReleased the same year as the delightfully dance-y “Into the Groove,” this downbeat ballad made for “Vision Quest” earned Madonna her first Grammy nomination in 1986. She makes an appearance as a club singer serenading an entwined Matthew Modine and Linda Fiorentino with this slow-jam prom staple.\n\n'Sooner or Later'\n\nFor \"Dick Tracy,\" 1990.\n\nBathed in sensuous pink light and poured into a slinky sequined gown framed with a fur boa, Madonna goes full-on vamp in her 1991 Academy Awards performance of this song. Penned by Stephen Sondheim for her to perform as lounge singer Breathless Mahoney in “Dick Tracy,” the Oscar-winning jazz number lets the singer dig into her deepest soulful register with ease.\n\n'Live to Tell'\n\nFor \"At Close Range,\" 1986.\n\nDramatic and foreboding, “Live to Tell” accompanies her then-husband Sean Penn’s film “At Close Range” with an undercurrent of suspicion and resilience in its lyrics. It’s one of the most somber songs of her early career, including self-written lyrics like: “Hope I live to tell/The secret I have learned, ’till then/It will burn inside of me.” It’s also notable for stripping down her loud early ‘80s style for a subdued, matured look of subtle makeup and wavy golden tresses.\n\n'Die Another Day'\n\nFor \"Die Another Day,\" 2002.\n\nGetting to perform the theme song for a James Bond movie is no small accomplishment and can transform an artist’s career. But Madonna didn’t need to perform the 20th title tune to the longest-running film franchise to reach another level. She was already two decades into a chart-topping career. But when EON Productions calls, you answer. Her techno-infused theme and are accompanying title sequence is unlike any other in the franchise, and the film is nonsensical and over the top, full of early 2000’s decadence and triviality. Neither ages well.\n\nMORE: Best James Bond Themes: John Barry, Wings\n\n'This Used to Be My Playground'\n\nFor \"A League of Their Own,\" 1992.\n\nThough this song didn’t appear on the soundtrack to Penny Marshall’s “A League of Their Own,” Madonna’s melancholy musings were tied in with the movie as a single. It reached No. 1 just months before her sexually charged “Erotica” dropped a new era of controversy.\n\n'I'll Remember'\n\nFor \"With Honors,\" 1994.\n\nSubdued and sentimental, “I’ll Remember” is a saccharine song full of breathy vocals offering feel-good introspection. Tied in with the university-set drama “With Honors,” the theme is one of her most low-key singles. It later was featured on the ballad-driven “Something to Remember” compilation.\n\n'Who's That Girl'\n\nFor \"Who's That Girl,\" 1987.\n\nThe title track from Madonna’s 1987 star vehicle, “Who’s That Girl?” is her second single to feature lyrics sung in Spanish (following “La Isla Bonita”). Curious, cute and completely infatuated with Latin culture, the single captures a definitive moment in the middle of “True Blue”-era Madonna.\n\n'Causing a Commotion'\n\nFor \"Who's That Girl,\" 1987.\n\nInspired by her tempestuous, headline-grabbing relationship with actor Sean Penn, Madonna’s second single from “Who’s That Girl” is surprisingly upbeat. She reflected on Penn’s violent behavior, telling “Rolling Stone” in 1987: “I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it.\" The song was recently revived by Welsh singer-songwriter Rod Thomas, who performs as Bright Light Bright Light for his ‘80s-influenced “Cinematography 2: Back in the Habit” cover album."
