        "text": "Hmm, let's see what YouTube says about breaking into a bank vault with music:\n\nOne could argue that Tangerine Dream's music for Thief has become a bit of a template for this kind of thing for some other movies. But that's about as far as it goes.\n\nThe director is the database.\n\nWhich is fortunate as I'm not sure I want to be in a world where every comedy animation involves a slide flute.\n\nI think maybe what you're really looking for is an understanding of the unique musical characterstics typically associated with different types of cues: action, comedy, fantasy, drama, epic, etc...\n\nI would suggest doing a Google and/or YouTube search for \"how to compose fantasy\" or \"how to compose romantic comedy\" or \"how to compose action\", etc... There are lots of composition tutorials that walk through the basic musical components typically associated with specific types of cues.\n\nThat said, as others have already pointed out, if you try to gather examples from different movies, you'll quickly find there's no single one-size-fits-all musical approach for a love scene, action scene, suspense scene, etc. Ultimately, it all depends on what the director wants. Some directors may want an orchestral score (Gladiator), a jazz score (The Transporter), a lo-fi indie score (Juno), an experimental score (Tenet), or whatever...\n\nYou may also want to search for articles and videos that explain how to convey different emotions with music. For example, this article from the Abbey Road Institute:\n\nEmotion in Music (Part II), a practical approach\n\nWelcome to part 2 of our ‘Emotion in Music’ blog series. In our previous blog from our ‘emotion in music series,’ we explored the neuroscience of music. In other words; what happens in your brain when you listen to music from an emotional perspective. You can find the article here...\n\n...that contains this chart:\n\nThis video provides an extremely simple breakdown of how to convey different cinematic emotions, and includes direct comparisons with actual film scores:\n\nHave fun!\n\nI think maybe what you're really looking for is an understanding of the unique musical characterstics typically associated with different types of cues: action, comedy, fantasy, drama, epic, etc...\n\nYessir!\n\nif you try to gather examples from different movies, you'll quickly find there's no single one-size-fits-all musical approach for a love scene, action scene, suspense scene, etc.\n\nI know I am not looking for a one-size-fits-all sort of thing, I am instead looking for something to use as a guideline. Something to get me started, and I will take it from there. I look at this as a good way to learn. Then eventually, I won't need a chart. Thanks.\n\nI know I am not looking for a one-size-fits-all sort of thing, I am instead looking for something to use as a guideline. Something to get me started, and I will take it from there. I look at this as a good way to learn. Then eventually, I won't need a chart. Thanks.\n\nDo what works best for you, but personally I would advise against this kind of thing, so as to avoid falling into tired clichés and tropes. If there is a formula of how a love scene is composed with a high percentage of boxes to be ticked, I would say that's probably the fastest road to sounding generic and stocky.\n\nYou got a lot of replies to this on Facebook, but the one other thing I would add is to listen to films and music and really internalise how you would suggest 'danger', 'peacefulness', 'tension' etc - just on piano. Or just on guitar. And then with a small ensemble or synths or orchestra etc.\n\nSo much of this depends on the stylistic language of the film and the context of the scene within it. You need to be able to respond to a director saying 'this love scene is really a tragedy, but it needs to be sexy too - and we need to play in the same electro-atonal space as the rest of the score' by having an instinctual idea of where you will go musically. And a database of tropes is unlikely to help too much with that.\n\nYou got a lot of replies to this on Facebook,\n\nYeah - those people are nuts! LOL\n\nOf course there is listening to films and music, and studying what other composers do. I never said I wouldnt do that. But I want to learn. And that's one way. Another way would be looking at a sheet of paper with staves and notes and emulating what you see. Another way would be to look at a sheet of paper that has a generalization of what type of music may work with what scene. Love scene - high sweeping violins, and harp arpeggios. Ok, now that I see that, put it to the side, and put my hands on the kbd. It's just a learning tool is all - it's not the way to score a film - nor the way to score a scene. It's just another tool to add to the arsenal.\n\nWhat you are looking for is typically classified under “musical topics” in the scholarly literature and there is no comprehensive database, though there are many studies of individual topics. Genre is closely related to topic and so genre studies often has the sort of information you are looking for as well.\n\nSilent film anthologies often classified music by mood, topic, and genre so can be helpful in offering sets of exemplars, and something similar was true of music publishers during the period, who offered catalogues of the standard repertory classified in this fashion so it could be more easily identified by music directors and librarians of silent film theaters.\n\nAfter sound film, this practice didn’t disappear as a commercial practice, since radio continued to have a use for the classifications as did any films using library music, as was common outside the big studios. That would eventually lead to the library music industry that is current today, and you can still recognize some of the old moods and topics in the tags and other classificatory devices used as finding aids.\n\nAs far as I know there isn’t a good analytical glossary, however, to any of it, the academic studies of individual topics still being the best sources for in-depth coverage and “how to”s.\n\nDefinitely check out the Orchestration Recipes. I grabbed Vol 2 on Black Friday sale and it's wonderful! Vol 2 is cinima focused and gives detailed explanation of what instruments to use, how to use them, and the role they each play in generating the mood for that recipe. I've barely gotten into these yet, but It's definitely the most inspiring and valuable musical purchase I've made in a long time.\n\nthe one other thing I would add is to listen to films and music and really internalise how you would suggest 'danger', 'peacefulness', 'tension' etc\n\nYes, absolutely. Good thing to do. But I also want to hear how other people interpret these things as well. It's all part of the learning process, tho some people apparently can't see it that way.\n\nThere's a book you might find interesting called Motion Picture Moods For Pianists and Organists. It was originally published in the 1920s for the house pianist/organist in a cinema so they knew what to play alongside whatever scene was currently on the screen. You can find the 1970s reprint available quite cheaply.\n\nNo scene is an island. If you're scoring a love scene you're not necessarily scoring what's on the screen. How does that scene relate to the broader story? Maybe the love scene is an illicit affair and the man is feeling guilty, so then you're scoring guilt. Or maybe it's some kind of honey trap so now you're scoring deception. Or maybe it's a new relationship for the woman after the death of her husband, so how would you score that?"
