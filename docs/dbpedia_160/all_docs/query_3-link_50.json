        "text": "Are you having a productive day? Perhaps consider Dolly Parton and think again.\n\nOne afternoon in 1973, a flash of inspiration saw her sit down and write two classics back to back.\n\nFirst came Jolene - a career-defining smash, synonymous with Parton alone. The next? I Will Always Love You.\n\nNot a bad nine-to-five.\n\nThat tender second track, released 50 years ago this week, remains one of her lesser-known credits, despite soundtracking love and heartbreak for half a century. It was Whitney Houston's cover version, recorded for the soundtrack of The Bodyguard in 1992, that elevated the song to classic status.\n\nA response to Parton's Instagram post celebrating the anniversary of \"her song\" made the public's confusion clear.\n\n\"It will always hold a special place in my heart as I hope it does yours,\" Parton wrote on Tuesday, only for one of the top-rated replies to confess: \"I never realised it was your song.\"\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

What a way to make a living.\n\nCold-blooded beginnings\n\nThe sweetness of Dolly Parton's original version belies the independent, lone-wolf mindset that created it.\n\nHaving moved to Nashville from east Tennessee after leaving school in 1964, Parton found only middling success as a singer-songwriter before catching the eye of singer Bill Phillips, who duetted on her song Put it Off Until Tomorrow.\n\nCountry star Porter Wagoner then invited Parton to be the \"girl singer\" on his TV show - eventually signing her to his label and giving her the big break she craved.\n\nParton's first single on that label, a cover of Tom Paxton's The Last Thing on My Mind, was a duet with Wagoner. When it made the country top 10 in 1968, it sparked the beginning of a formidable musical partnership.\n\nBut by 1973, Parton wanted to make the stage and TV screens hers alone. \"I had come to Nashville to be my own star,\" she told DJ Howard Stern in 2023.\n\n\"I really felt like I needed to move on. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life being a girl singer. I knew my destiny. I knew that I had to continue doing what I felt... drawn to do.\"\n\nMaking her mind up was one thing, breaking the news to Wagoner another.\n\nRecalling the agony of conflicted emotions, she said: \"How am I going to make him understand how much I appreciate everything, but that I have to go?\n\n\"I thought, well, what do you do best? You write songs. So I sat down and I wrote this song.\"\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

(Parton had herself tried, performing it onscreen alongside Burt Reynolds in 1982's The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. The re-recorded film version once again topped the Billboard country chart, a first at the time, but failed to make the main top 40).\n\nIt was Costner, according to Stereogum's The Number Ones column, who suggested Houston sing a country song.\n\nScepticism reigned, but a tape was made of potential tunes, including Linda Ronstadt's 1975 cover of Parton's humble ballad. Producer David Foster reworked it into a brooding, ultimately climactic tour de force that let Houston's voice run riot.\n\nWhitney Houston told Rolling Stone magazine she thought Parton was \"a hell of a writer and a hell of a singer\", adding she was \"concerned\" how she would feel about the cover.\n\nShe added it meant so much when Parton said she was \"floored\" by her version.\n\n\"Parton's recording has an understated purity and authenticity that's irresistible. Houston's version is similarly affecting but delivered on a vastly different scale,\" Lee tells the BBC.\n\nIts a capella opening, again included on Costner's suggestion to better fit the film, builds to Houston's lung-busting final verse and note.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

It was ringing some sort of bell... By the time I realised that she was ready to go into the chorus... I couldn't believe my little country sad song could even be done like that.\n\n\"That was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had in my entire life.\"\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\nHouston's version became a mammoth hit worldwide, spending 10 weeks at number one in the UK, where it was the biggest-selling single of the year, and 14 weeks atop the US Billboard charts. It proved so successful that it eventually won record of the year at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nWith global sales topping 20 million, the song reportedly earned Parton more than $10m (£7m) in royalties from Houston's cover in the 1990s alone.\n\nIn 2021, she told chat show host Andy Cohen she had invested some of the money in a black neighbourhood in Nashville as a tribute to Houston, who died at the age of 48 in 2012.\n\n\"It was mostly just black families and people that lived around there,\" Parton said. \"It was a whole strip mall. And I thought, 'This is the perfect place for me to be, considering it was Whitney'.\"\n\nThe former star of The Pussycat Dolls, Melody Thornton, was trying to sing her solo when people began joining in and singing completely out of tune.\n\nThornton said she \"fought really hard\" and \"felt awful\" the show had been cut short.\n\nAs for Presley, Parton says she's since made enough money from all iterations of the song combined to be able to afford to buy his famous Graceland property multiple times over.\n\nAnd in an effort to solve the mystery of his 'lost' cover, Lee says: \"I imagine he would have treated it respectfully, layering it with the kind of subtlety and vocal restraint he brought to his covers of songs like Can't Help Falling in Love and Unchained Melody.\"\n\nFan versions, made through AI, (sort of) reach the same conclusion.\n\nAll that's left is for you to take a deep breath, turn up the volume on the chorus and, well, you know the rest. It would be rude not to. For Parton, Presley and Houston."
