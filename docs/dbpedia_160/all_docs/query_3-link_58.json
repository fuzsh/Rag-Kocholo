        "text": "Celine Song: We should do the intro. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Hi. I'm Sofia Coppola and this is...\n\nCeline Song: Celine Song. This is the A24 podcast.\n\nSofia Coppola: Well, I'm happy to see you and talk about movies.\n\nCeline Song: I'm so happy to see you.\n\nSofia Coppola: Do you feel like enough time has passed after your movie that you can think about it or are you still tired of talking about it?\n\nCeline Song: It's been a whole year.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: It's been whole year.\n\nSofia Coppola: When did it come out?\n\nCeline Song: Came on Sundance. Sundance was world premier last year.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, my gosh. Years ago.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: I went back.\n\nSofia Coppola: One year ago, or two years ago?\n\nCeline Song: One year ago.\n\nSofia Coppola: Really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, my God. I remember seeing Past Lives at the Angelika when it was there. It was like the first time I'd been in a theater with an audience and I just loved it. The room was packed and people were so into it. It just made me excited about movies, the kind of movies that I love. It was so personal. It's always when something that's touching, but not embarrassing. It's done just with restraint and taste. Yeah. I loved it.\n\nBut I'm just curious, I know you were a playwright before, and this is your first film. Did you make short films before or is this the first time you ever did something with the camera?\n\nCeline Song: It's the first time. Well, I think that I was in theater for 10 years. I remember transitioning into film. Then I was thinking about this before, which is that when we first met, we met at the Chanel event. I remember sitting there and looking over at you and being like, \"Oh, my God. Sofia Coppola is here. Oh, Sofia is here.\"\n\nThen of course you came up and then you told me that you saw it at the Angelika. To me, I'm like that's just feels so special because, of course, the New York film.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. To be in New York and go in my neighborhood and see it.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah. Walk over to the movie theater. That was one of my favorite parts of moving to New York, that you can just walk over to your neighborhood movie theater and be like, \"I hope the movie I want to see is there.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Were you excited that your movie was at the Angelika? Did you go there?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Of course.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: I feel like that was such a wild thing. I feel like being in theater, so much of your life is about ... theater is local.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Right? In such a deep way.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Have you wanted to work in theater?\n\nSofia Coppola: I did once. I directed an opera in Rome. At the Rome Opera House, I did La Traviata.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, my God.\n\nSofia Coppola: It was really the scariest thing I've ever done and just rely so much on my cinematographer that not having the camera to tell the story was really interesting. But then it realized it wasn't that different. You're still telling a story with actors and just using lighting and staging. It was so exciting. Because I remember that she has to walk down this big staircase and thought, \"What if she falls?\" That live thing is so ... yeah, it was such an exciting different experience.\n\nCeline Song: But I love that about film where I'm just like, you're never going to miss the lighting cue. You're never going to miss the sound cue. Because that's a natural part of live performance. It's like your stage manager is always having to do that accurately every night. They're there every night, hitting the ...\n\nSofia Coppola: I never thought about that. For you, you can really get it exactly how you imagine and not worry about something being off.\n\nCeline Song: A movie. Anytime you play it's going to be the same. But in theater, it might be a little sooner, a little bit later than you might want it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. And does each performance feel different to you?\n\nCeline Song: Of course. Well, the audience is different and actors are ... they're people. In fact, they are people.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I find it really mysterious because it's not that familiar to me. But I thought it was exciting. But it's totally foreign.\n\nCeline Song: Well, because the actors respond to the animal that is the audience. You're seeing the actors changed their performance.\n\nSofia Coppola: Interesting.\n\nCeline Song: We get to see that, I feel like in film in front of the camera.\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. Right. But the audience doesn't choose it.\n\nCeline Song: Of course. I'm sure that's what was happening to you, because that's what's happening to me where if I look happy, the actors, I'm their audience, the actor will ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Play for you.\n\nCeline Song: Play for you. Yeah. Right. Then if I look worried, they're like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That's so interesting that you probably have ... That's so smart that as you're directing that you know that you're the audience, because you've had that experience in the theater. But that's totally ... I didn't think of it as that you're being their audience live. But it makes sense. They totally are looking for your reaction and shapes it.\n\nCeline Song: You're the chief audience. The director is the chief audience. But of course, the whole crew, our cinematographers, they're also the audience, too. Also, the director sets the tone.\n\nSofia Coppola: Definitely.\n\nCeline Song: There's a bit of performance that I felt like I had to do.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That's interesting. No. I do feel like that everyone's looking, too. I think of it as motherhood because it's the same kind of role where they're looking at you. Is it okay? It's the same thing I feel like with kids or something. I feel like, yeah, and definitely setting the tone, I think that makes a huge difference.\n\nI know people have said, \"Oh, your sets are calm.\" I realize I don't spend time on other people's sets that much, but I definitely have a rule about no yelling or I never want an AD that's a screamer. That's so unnecessary. I do think that the atmosphere is important. I bet from your movie that it was ... because of your demeanor, that it was calm.\n\nCeline Song: I think yelling everything. But I feel like more importantly, it's like it just can't ever turn personal, because we're all there to do work. I think to me, I'm like that when you talk about motherhood, I felt that way so much.\n\nSofia Coppola: You want to take care of your people.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Because I'm not a mother. It really, I think, that directing a movie made me realize that I could do it. I could be a mom. There was a real revelation for me because before I made Past Lives, I was like, \"Can I be a mom? Is that something that I can do?\" Then once I made it, I'm just like, \"I can do it.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: You can do anything after that. You're taking care of people and everyone's looking to you at the same time can falls down, they look at you and then you have to be like, \"Yeah. You're fine.\" Yeah. It's a similar thing.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. You were so right. I think you're just holding it down, and even when you're scared.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You have to.\n\nCeline Song: You can't let the kids know.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. You're all set.\n\nCeline Song: You can let your partner know. Because sometimes I feel like ... sometimes the partner's different.\n\nSofia Coppola: Definitely. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Usually, I feel like my producer is usually they're the partners that I can go to them and say, \"I'm scared.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. No. I love having ... I have a producer that I work with all the time, and I feel like I could fall apart - I don't have to be strong with him. But I remember I was having a hard time right before I was about to start shooting on Priscilla, we had to cut a bunch of the script down the week before. My kids were calling from ... I was in Toronto. My kids were in New York. They needed me.\n\nI looked at my DP and he's really sensitive. I look like I was about to fall apart. I was like, \"I need to be strong.\" He's like, \"You don't have to be strong all the time.\" It was so sweet. But having those relationships with your crew that you really trust and that you can have doubts and be vulnerable, I felt like is so ...\n\nCeline Song: Totally. I feel like you can always ask for help from them. There was a moment where I was like ... everything had gone very badly for that day, and we didn't know if we're going to get what we needed. For all the technical reasons. Basically, we were trying to catch this one sunset. We had a whole plan about catching the sunset. That day, because it was cloudy, there was no sun. We scouted that location 10 times.\n\nSofia Coppola: For that sunset.\n\nCeline Song: For that sunset. We had prepped it for the sunset, and there was no sun to set.\n\nSofia Coppola: What did you do?\n\nCeline Song: Well, it was funny. There was a part of it, because we had invested so much into that sunset that we were all like, I don't know, you don't want to give up on it. In a funny way, I think that me and my DP and our whole crew, we were acting like a miracle was going to happen. But of course, miracle didn't happen. Then there was a moment where I had to be like, \"Well, the miracle is not coming. We're going to have to go and ask our actors to bail us out.\" That's what happened.\n\nI asked my actors, Teo and Greta, who were waiting to go. I went to them and I was like, \"There's no sunset. We have time for maybe three takes. You're going to have to bail us out.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Meaning that they're going to have to make the magical moment?\n\nCeline Song: They're going to have to ...\n\nSofia Coppola: You shot it without a sunset.\n\nCeline Song: We shot it without the sunset. But it's the scene in front of the carousel where it's just like a one ... you just one position for the camera. Then we just do the whole scene there. We just roll on that three times.\n\nSofia Coppola: Until you lose the light?\n\nCeline Song: Until you lose the light. But of course, when I was in the edit, I was like, \"Oh.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: You forgot about ...\n\nCeline Song: The sunset was going to be too much.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, see. It works out the way ... I hope always works out the way it's supposed to.\n\nCeline Song: Sometimes I'm like, \"Well, there's a movie god, and sometimes a movie god is blessing you.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. But I feel like an experience it always works out the way it's supposed to. Sometimes if an actor ends up falling out, you can't get them. You have to get someone else. Then you're always like, \"Oh, I'm so glad it was them. They're so much better than that.\" I felt like there is. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Well, the right person is the right person always.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Things like that. It would've been too much. I felt like it. Well, you just have to make what you can with what you have. But I think usually it works out the way it's meant to be something.\n\nCeline Song: Exactly. I mean, it is a delusion? But I don't think.\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I don't think so.\n\nCeline Song: Sometimes it's objectively better.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the excitement of it, because you lose a location or the weather or something and you have to figure it out, and then you come up with something that you might not have thought of.\n\nCeline Song: I mean, I feel like what I always think about with your films is the, of course, casting is everything, but I feel like the way that your voice is also seen through casting. I always think about that so much.\n\nSofia Coppola: I loved your cast.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I loved your cast, too. I feel like your cast, you can tell what your director's voice is actually seen very much through casting. I feel like I was always so curious about the way that you cast. Like, \"What was your process of thinking about Jacob and Cailee?\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Thank you. Yeah. I loved your cast. I think, I guess it's a reflection of your taste or how you see a woman and what qualities.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I never thought about that. The personality of the person does come through.\n\nCeline Song: Of course.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I usually just think I meet people that you connect with, you think that they have the same sense of humor, or they seem smart, or it's a taste thing of how they would ... then you trust them of how they would approach things. I feel like when I first worked with Kirsten Dunst, I felt like, it was my first film. Just having that being on the same wavelength helped me so much, because she got what I was talking about without having to explain so much. Then as we worked together over the years, that's something that I love, having that rapport.\n\nBut you think it's just you're drawn to certain people and talking to them, they get what you're talking about. They have to convey what you have in your mind.\n\nCeline Song: Totally. It's like if they get it, they get it, right?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: I do think it's about a tasting, too. Sometimes, I can't explain why that's the right person, even though if you were to break it down objectively, maybe the person that I don't think is right, and the person that I do think are right, most people can't tell the difference, but I know.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I feel like whoever you're just excited about, that's when I can't tell. I'm just like, \"Who would I be excited to see in that part?\"\n\nCeline Song: Totally.\n\nSofia Coppola: But that's a big part, what I'm writing that motivates me. The part I love is getting the actors there and seeing them play it out. Do you imagine sometimes actors when you were writing that or ...\n\nCeline Song: I have real trouble doing that.\n\nSofia Coppola: Well, this story seems so personal. Were you just putting yourself into it? How autobiographical was it?\n\nCeline Song: Well, I feel like I would say it was inspired by an autobiographical moment, because it's like the opening scene of sitting between the child sweetheart who come to visit and your husband.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, I love that opening. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: That was happening.\n\nSofia Coppola: What's going on? Did that happen to you?\n\nCeline Song: That happened to me. I was sitting there with my child sweetheart, who was now a friend and had come to visit me from Korea. It wasn't like that kind of a thing. But we did speak a separate language than the one I have with my husband who I live with in New York City.\n\nSofia Coppola: He doesn't speak English?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. He doesn't speak English. My husband tries. But doesn't really speak Korean. I think that really translating between these two people and realizing both of them know a part of me that the other person doesn't know, but they're trying. What a beautiful thing that they're trying to know what the other person knows.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. The different sides of yourself?\n\nCeline Song: Different sides of myself. But also, I felt like, \"Well, I'm only whole. I could only be known wholly if both of them are here. I can only be known by them collectively if they both are trying to communicate what they know about me.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. You're the only one that ...\n\nCeline Song: I'm the only one also. So I had to be loved in this way, and that's the only way I could be loved and full, and how good they were to each other, and how much they wanted to be decent to each other.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so sweet.\n\nCeline Song: That was such a moving thing. I think that moment was the inspiration for the whole thing.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so interesting.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I feel like when it comes to autobiographical things, some of it is about like, \"Well, what does the character want?\" Sometimes it's like, \"Well, this part of autobiography is really interesting for the character.\" Some of it I'm just like, \"It's not that interesting.\" I think it's just a puzzle for that. That's one. But I would feel like in general in my life, I don't think I've ever been able to write for a specific actor.\n\nSofia Coppola: Because you're thinking about moments.\n\nCeline Song: Because it's a character.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Or yourself.\n\nCeline Song: Because you're trying to create characters that exist for the film alone.\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. Right.\n\nCeline Song: I wish that I was a little bit more like if I get blah, blah, blah for this role, it'd be perfect. Also, I want to see new sides of actors, too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Definitely.\n\nCeline Song: You know what I mean?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I think that's exciting when you see someone, you're like you know that they could do something that they haven't shown before.\n\nCeline Song: I love that.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That's super exciting.\n\nCeline Song: Because it's like I want to always be able to say that to the actor that I'm working with every day to be like, \"We're going to do something new today.\" Otherwise, I think they feel like tools or objects for the thing.\n\nSofia Coppola: You want it to be exciting and a challenge for everyone.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. You want it to feel like it's a relationship we're having.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That you're finding it together.?\n\nCeline Song: Exactly. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you ever explore that in a play before you decided to make it as a film?\n\nCeline Song: No. No.\n\nSofia Coppola: Or you were thinking about a film and that story could fit as a film instead of a play?\n\nCeline Song: Well, I think I actually felt like the film was the only way that this particular story could work, because it spans decades and continents. It kind of is like you kind need to feel the location and the ... My joke is usually that it's the villain of the story is 24 years in Pacific Ocean. That's the reason why they're not together. It's not because of anything else. It's because of the way that our lives work out.\n\nSofia Coppola: Changed. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Of course. I assume that when you're working on Priscilla, part of it is that you fell in love with the book of it, right?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Just in her book, I was surprised with that ... there were parts that were relatable and just the human aspect that any girl had gone to these different moments, and then to hear what she went through. It was just surprising. Just that the complexity of their relationship. I think, I don't know, I guess it related to that we all go through, or when you're younger, you can be in relationships where you think it's your whole life.\n\nThen of course, it just becomes a moment in your life that shapes you and just how much you'll learn and put up with in a relationship. Yeah. Just what she went through, I thought it was relatable to that experience of being young and crushes.\n\nCeline Song: Of course. But also, the wanting to be in a relationship with Justin Bieber.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Right.\n\nSofia Coppola: Exactly.\n\nCeline Song: Because that's who Elvis was. Because Elvis was just the biggest possible star. It's how teenage girls want to be in a relationship with Timothee Chalamet.\n\nSofia Coppola: If they could.\n\nCeline Song: There's a lot of fan fiction about that.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Or about Harry Styles.\n\nCeline Song: Like Harry Styles. There's a really famous one, I think. But I don't totally get it. Because I think it's like he locks you up. I want to say. Which I think is ... I was thinking about it.\n\nSofia Coppola: I never understood those 50 Shades of Gray. Did you ever read Nine and a Half Weeks, the book?\n\nCeline Song: No. I haven't read 50 Shades of Gray either.\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I haven't either. I mean, I think I tried to. They sent it to me when they were making it. I was like, \"No way.\" I don’t want to insult anyone but just it's so funny.\n\nCeline Song: I mean, I think it's just that thing where it's funny, the desire to be dominated by the person that you adore.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I don't get that as an adult. But I can see it as a teenager that it's like ...\n\nCeline Song: I think so.\n\nSofia Coppola: ... there's so much mystery.\n\nCeline Song: I wonder if it's also a part of being such a ... Because something that really struck me about your movie, Priscilla, is such a good girl.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. But I feel she has a rebellious side.\n\nCeline Song: Well, that's what I mean. Well, I was a pretty good girl when I was little. I think that part of it is when you're a good girl, but you want all these ... but you're so burning for something. A part of it's that you just have bad desires. Because at school, I'm like, I do my homework. I show up.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Me too. I'm not that rebellious.\n\nCeline Song: Were you like this as well? But then I feel like because of that ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You want to have another side.\n\nCeline Song: You want to have another side. What an amazing thing that your other side is, for Priscilla, it's being in a secret relationship with Elvis.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. To me, it's like the ultimate of all the desires of that age.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. That you don't want to be ... You've been in so much trouble. You know what I mean? What a special feeling. But then you're in so much trouble, but you're so in love, and he's the most powerful person ever.\n\nSofia Coppola: It's so crazy. But I think it's super romantic in the eye ...\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah. But it's not what it seems, too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. No. I love that, that it looks like this fairytale and then the darkness of it. I'm excited that about you starting this as a film. How did you put your team together? I feel like it takes a while to find your team and this being your first film. Did you know any of the crew before? Or how did you find them?\n\nCeline Song: I show them my script and then they wanted to do it.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's great.\n\nCeline Song: I mean, I usually call it my seduction technique, the Animal Kingdom that you have ... they have ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yours is writing, that's your superpower.\n\nCeline Song: I had to show them the script. Of course, the script is meant as a pitch document, because it’s meant to be like, \"This is the movie it's going to be.\" It's like if they wanted to come and do it ... By the way, it's not like most of the people, first person that we would sent to, they would read it and they'll want to do it. But I think sometimes you don't get it. Then that's okay. Then I'm like, \"Oh, that's such a lovely way to know.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: If they're the right person.\n\nCeline Song: I'm Like, \"Well, the movie that I want to make isn't changing. If they don't really think that it's cool, then that's not totally okay.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That's so wise of you. I remember when I was trying to do Lost in Translation, and I met a few different producers, and my script was very slim, and it was very, very minimal. I remember some producer being like, \"Oh, we'll work on the story more\" and just didn't get it at all. Then I met another producer, they were like, \"Oh, yeah. This is cool. We can do it.\" Then they end up working with them. It's true. Maybe your project just finds who clicks with it.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I agree. I think it is like dating. Where's just like, well, for somebody, you're exactly what they're looking for. You don't want to be with anybody who is not ... that you're not that for you.\n\nSofia Coppola: Doesn't get you. I think so much of it is a sensibility. I love the guy who plays your husband. Had you worked with him in the theater?\n\nCeline Song: No. I met all of them in audition or a meeting.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you know Greta from other ...\n\nCeline Song: No. I didn't know her.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I didn't know her from ... I hadn't watched that show. But she was more of a comedy person.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. I think most of her work was in comedy. A lot of it was in TV. Then she auditioned. She sent in a tape.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: Teo, who plays Hae Sung sent in the tape.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you know right away when you saw them?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You just do.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. You just meet them and then you're like, \"I think it's you.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Right. Then you just try to see if you're right. That's what the audition was. My callback audition, which I did for three hours each.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: I talked to Greta for two and a half hours. I talked to Teo for three and a half hours. But that's just to confirm that ...\n\nSofia Coppola: That you guys can spend this time together. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Also, I need to know that my instinct is right. Because you meet them and you're like, \"I think you're right.\" But then you have to be like, \"Okay.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Check it out a little.\n\nCeline Song: Exactly.\n\nSofia Coppola: Second date.\n\nCeline Song: Second date. You just have to keep pushing on the date and being like, \"Are we right about this together? Right about this?\" Well, we're not quite right about that, but we know that we have this other common ground. I think it's getting to know them in that way.\n\nSofia Coppola: When you're in the theater, did you direct plays to your ...\n\nCeline Song: No. I just wrote.\n\nSofia Coppola: But the writer more the prominent voice into that?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're the author.\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. You're always working with the director about how you want the tone or whatever?\n\nCeline Song: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: It wasn't that different from what you had done in it?\n\nCeline Song: No. I learned it's not that much different at all, actually. I mean, I feel like when you met Cailee and Jacob, did you also feel like, \"I think this is the right person?\" Or does it take you a longer courtship?\n\nSofia Coppola:No. No. I just met Cailee. I met them each once. Then I looked at other people's tapes and stuff, but I always came back to them. I learned from when I was casting Somewhere, Elle Fanning, I met her when she was 11. Fred Roos who helps me. We've met her and we loved her. But he is always like, \"We have to be thorough. We have to meet everyone. But she's the one to beat.\" I always remember that. She's our favorite.\n\nThen we meet all these girls and everyone. I was like, \"No. They're not Elle. They're not Elle.\" I think when you meet someone you just know, but then there's that thoroughness of making sure you meet everyone.\n\nCeline Song:\n\nTotally.\n\nSofia Coppola: But I felt like... you get excited. You see them as that, and you're excited about seeing them in that part. I want to ask you about writing, because I find that the hardest part. Do you ever get stuck or do you have rituals around writing? Do you procrastinate a lot? Do all writers procrastinate?\n\nCeline Song: I think so.\n\nSofia Coppola: Are you disciplined about writing?\n\nCeline Song: No. Well, I think that discipline, I think comes in a different shape. Because I feel like in my discipline, do I write five hours a day? No.\n\nSofia Coppola: Do you have an office that you go to or you write to ...\n\nCeline Song: Kitchen table.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. I've done that. But now I have kids, I have to get out. But yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I would say it's the hardest part anyway.\n\nSofia Coppola: Your husband's a writer?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. He's a writer. I feel like part of it is you're just ... I don't know, you just feel like a little piece of broccoli on the kitchen counter for most of the process of writing. You're just so useless for so long.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Do you ever ... I think of having an inkling of idea, but you don't know the rest of it. Then do you feel like you just force yourself to ...\n\nCeline Song: I feel like I can't start unless I know how it's going to go and how it ends.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's where the procrastination comes in.\n\nSofia Coppola: It's just walking around and thinking about it.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Then just writing three lines of dialogue and then calling it a day.\n\nSofia Coppola: Do you have to force yourself when you don't feel like it just to do something?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Well, I feel like I usually find it to be ... If there's an assignment, there's an adaptation, there's an assignment, those I can do.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Me too. But when you have to write your own personal thing?\n\nCeline Song: I think it's a little bit more like you just sit and then you just like ... I don't know. I wish that I knew how to describe it in a way that sounds more like “It's awesome! Let's go!”\n\nSofia Coppola: No. No. I find it the hardest.\n\nCeline Song: You just sit there and you're just like, \"Well, I clearly don't know how to do this. Never been able to do it. Was I ever good? Was I ever able to do it? How do you finish that last script? I can't remember.\" Then you just are like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: I'll do it.\n\nCeline Song: ... just little piece of broccoli just sitting in the side of the kitchen, just a kitchen counter drying out. Then eventually you're like, \"Oh, wait. Maybe that's\" ...\n\nSofia Coppola: I feel like sometimes I just make stuff up, because I need something. Then it ends up being part of the story, even though I feel like it's just some dumb thing that happened to me. I put it in because I need some pages.\n\nCeline Song: Well, I think about that when it comes to ... Well, you're talking about just the dumb thing that you just worked on part of it, where it's like, \"I think it is kind of like that. I think we have to allow ourself to be bad and stupid.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I guess your subconscious is part of it at some point. Did you ever hear about ... it was really popular in the '90s, The Artist's Way, this book that we used to do Morning Pages?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: My friend was looking at it again, or someone told me to get it from my daughter. Then I was like, \"Oh, should we do this with the Morning Pages?\" I haven't done it. But I wondered if ...\n\nCeline Song: It's a prompt or something.\n\nSofia Coppola: I think it's just the idea that every morning you write a couple pages without thinking about it, and it's supposed to get your creativity flowing, but I don't know.\n\nCeline Song: I wonder if that's for morning people, another one?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. It's from ...\n\nCeline Song: Are you a morning person?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I used to write at night. I stay up all night writing. But now with kids, I can't do that. But there's something, but there's less pressure at night. I feel like you're not really part of the real working world. It makes it more like a hobby. It also makes a freedom in that.\n\nCeline Song: What's your working hour? How are your working hours usually?\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't know. But I used to just stay up all night writing. Yeah. Enjoy that while you can. But with having kids then I had to figure out, just getting out of ... going to a little office and then sitting there. Or I find it a lot when I leave, if I go away for a couple of days on my own, then I can just get lost in it. It's hard to switch with being responsible. I feel like when you're in the mode of a story, you need to be lost in it.\n\nCeline Song:Yeah. I think so. Then sometimes it happens ...\n\nSofia Coppola: I have to figure that.\n\nCeline Song: ... conveniently. You're like, \"Oh, my God. I'm about to walk into something.\" I'm already like, \"I want to go and work on that thing.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. When you get obsessed with it, then it's exciting. It feels a lot of like not knowing ... you're doing, and then you get thoroughly into something.\n\nCeline Song: Totally.\n\nSofia Coppola: Are you writing now? Do you know what you're going to do?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I mean, I am trying to write. But I think that's the issue when I'm ready.\n\nSofia Coppola: It's hard when you're still talking about this movie, probably.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. But the beginning of it, I think it's a lot of procrastination, a lot of feeling like a broccoli. Then I feel like it gets to a place where I feel like then I become a demon for that thing. Then I just need ... it usually takes me four weeks to write a script.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow. Well, that's fast.\n\nCeline Song: It's really fast. But that's because I don't do anything else for those two, four weeks.\n\nSofia Coppola: You just get into that.\n\nCeline Song: I cancel all my plans. I don't leave and I eat. When I eat, that's when I do emails. I mean, it's so ...\n\nSofia Coppola: You just get obsessed.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. It just becomes demonic.\n\nSofia Coppola: Do you just walk around and think about something until it gels enough that you can go into that mode?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I mean, honestly, it's more like, \"I just need to get this done by the end of the month.\" Sometimes it's just not even like, \"Eureka.\" Sometimes it's like, \"I have a bunch of eurekas, but more importantly, I want to get it done this month. I'm no longer interested in.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. Just want to get it out. Did you have a few ideas that you were thinking about before? Or do you feel pressure after this movie that everyone's excited to see your next movie?\n\nCeline Song: The pressure is I feel like how you see it. I feel like the first movie was tremendous amount of pressure, too, in a way.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I guess so.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. But I just thought because people are so love this movie and they're waiting for the next one, do you feel more pressure? I don't want to say that. It might make it worse.\n\nCeline Song: No. I know what you mean. But I think it's like, to me, I'm like, in a way, no, because it has to be good anytime. You're not going to walk into your next movie being like, \"Well, it's not my second one, so I'm chill.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's always ...\n\nCeline Song: You're always as good as the thing that you just made.\n\nSofia Coppola: It should be. You always want to make something that you don't want to put energy into something that you don't feel is the best version of it. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Exactly. In a way, I don't think it's any more of a pressure just because, in a way, I feel like it's less because at least people know what I did.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You know how to do it. Yeah. You know how to do it. At least to yourself, for yourself, too.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I just remember after my first film, Virgin Suicides, doing these young director things, and there was another director who had made her first film. I was like, \"I don't know what I'm going to do next. I don't know what I'm doing. Do you?\" She was like, \"Oh, yeah. I know it all what I'm doing.\" I was like, \"Okay. I don't know.\" I feel like I have to wander after each thing and just feel like the other one has to sink in before I know where I'm going next.\n\nCeline Song: Right. But then your second movie is Lost in Translation. Isn't it?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yes. Yes. It is. Yeah. But I so did not know what ... But I always have little inklings of wanting to do something from my experiences there.\n\nCeline Song: Of course. I mean, I feel like my answer when someone asks me about the stress around the second film, I'm always just like, \"There's so many filmmakers whose second films are amazing, and I hope to be one of them.\" I think about you. You know what I mean? Yeah. I'm like, \"What are you talking about, Sofia is\" ... nobody, whatever the second film slump or whatever.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: I'm just like, \"You know who didn't have one?\" Being a sophomore slump. You know who didn't have one? Sofia Coppola.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, thank you. I'm glad I could be.\n\nCeline Song: Of course.\n\nSofia Coppola: But I remember that moment of like, \"Now, I'm doing this. I fought so hard to make my first movie.\" Then it was like, \"Oh, now I can do this. Now what? But well, I'm glad. Well, I'm excited to see ...\n\nCeline Song: Me too.\n\nSofia Coppola: ... your next one.\n\nCeline Song: I can't wait to show you the next one. I can't wait to make it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I find that exciting when you have people that you have your team.\n\nCeline Song:Yeah. I think that I want my department heads. You know what I mean? It's like you just meet them and then you have an amazing experience working with them. Then you do it again. All I just want to do is do it again. I mean, do you all feel the itch to go back?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It's funny. Because at the end I'm like, \"I never want to do this again.\" My husband's like, \"You say that every time. I'm never doing this again.\" Now I'm thinking like, \"Oh, I want to try to not rush into something else and catch up on life when you,\" because you put it all aside. But then I get excited about certain actors. I'm like, \"Oh, I would love to do something with them.\" Kirsten, I always want to find something we can do together.\n\nCeline Song: She’s so amazing.\n\nSofia Coppola: That part motivates me and my great AD that I love in Toronto, I had such a great team on Priscilla that I am ... I loved working in Toronto. I feel like, \"Oh, there's this whole setup.\" I never used a built sets on stages before. That inspired me now that like, \"Oh, you could do anything.\" It's always exciting and it's great.\n\nCeline Song: The built set, I feel like it sounds not glamorous. But then every time I walked into the ... because we had built sets for Past Lives.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. The dorm room.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. It looks so natural. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: It's amazing teams. The dorm room and the Hae Sung's room where they do Skype together, because we needed to figure out how to do a live Skype acting.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, you're doing it at the same time?\n\nCeline Song: We're doing it at the same time.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's so smart. Don't you also, for the tax thing, you have to do a certain percentage on stage.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you shoot in New York?\n\nCeline Song: Shot in New York. Yeah. Shot in New York for 25 days, and then we shot in Korea for 10 days.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: In Korea, the set is even cheaper and faster.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: We had some set there, built the set in New York. I remember being like, \"Man, shooting on set. What even is that?\" Then you go in and you're just like, \"You can move walls. Put camera wherever you want. Then I can control everything.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I know. It's such a different. I always thought like, \"Oh, it has to be in a real place to feel real.\" But then once you do that, it's like, \"Yeah. You could do anything.\" Do you go to Korea often, or had you not been back for a long time?\n\nCeline Song: I hadn't been. Been back since 2015.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. I went back to visit my family there. But then I hadn't been. But also, this is the first time I went to Korea to work.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: It's the first time I met people in film, met people who work and do things.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so cool.\n\nCeline Song: It was really cool.\n\nSofia Coppola: I've never been.\n\nCeline Song: You've never been?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. No.\n\nCeline Song:\n\nYou've never been?\n\nSofia Coppola:\n\nNo. I really want to go.\n\nCeline Song:\n\nYou have to go.\n\nSofia Coppola: I want to go to Seoul. I might pronounce it. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I think you should go to Seoul and I think you should go to Busan. I think you should go.\n\nSofia Coppola: I'm going to check with you before I ...\n\nCeline Song: Maybe you want to go to Jeju, too. I feel like this little island, it's where you go for honeymoon. It's like Hawaii in Korea.\n\nSofia Coppola: Okay. I'm going to.\n\nCeline Song: I think you'll feel really happy and inspired there.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, cool.\n\nCeline Song: Feel it's great.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Okay. I’ll get your list before I go.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSofia Coppola: I mean, I feel like everyone always asks me which part of the process you like the best, the editing, but it's ...\n\nCeline Song: What's your favorite?\n\nSofia Coppola: It's hard to say because they all ... I think writing the least, except for when you hit print and you finish a draft, then that's the best. But I think writing is lonely. Yeah. I love editing.\n\nCeline Song: I love editing.\n\nSofia Coppola: You have all your stuff and putting it together. But it's fun to be on set, too. But I think editing, you don't have the time pressure. You can just play around.\n\nCeline Song: My line producer asked me the question, \"Fuck Mary. Kill pre-production, production, post-production.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, post production is kill?\n\nCeline Song: No. It's like you tell them which you would fuck and, which you would marry, an which you would kill.\n\nSofia Coppola: Okay. Okay.\n\nCeline Song: But the options are ...\n\nSofia Coppola: I thought was at stages. That you fuck ...\n\nCeline Song: No. No. The options are prep, production and post-production. For me, I would fuck production. Because it's so exciting. Then you have limited time, but there's so much that can happen. It's unpredictable. It's a lot of energy from hundreds of people. You don't know what you're going to get. Really ups and downs. Everybody's like passionate and we're trying to figure it out. We're going to do the best today.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. There's the rush.\n\nCeline Song: Post-production I would marry. It's day in and day out. It's like partnership and you feel connected to it. Then every day it gets better and hopefully ... Then sometimes some days it doesn't. Then you're grumpy. But you're annoyed. But also, you do it again and it's amazing. Then you build on something. You build a life. Pre-production, I would kill.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Mostly because it makes me feel like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: It's stressful.\n\nCeline Song: It's stressful. Also, I think it was especially hard of my first film because I'm being asked to make these massive binary decisions.\n\nSofia Coppola: You've never seen it before.\n\nCeline Song: I'm like, \"Oh, wow. That's going to cost how much, $200,000?\" I have to make a decision to spend that $200,000 right now.\n\nSofia Coppola: Before you've seen anything. Yeah. You're right.\n\nCeline Song: Seen anything. I don't have even a centimeter of film. But I'm saying, \"Yeah. Let's do it. It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be amazing.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: That's true. I always feel like in prep, I'm like, \"Let's just get started already. It feels like it takes forever is just a million schedule meetings.\" I'm like, \"Let's just do it.\"\n\nCeline Song: Well, we need it though. I really think prep is so ...\n\nSofia Coppola: But to me it's like doing homework. Let's just get to it. But the visual part is fun. I love the art department and the costumes. But the scheduling not so fun.\n\nCeline Song: Scheduling not so fun. But also, I don't know, I think sometimes I can get my Virgo organizer brain.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. How you're going to do it. That is fun. When you figure out like, \"We'll do this there.\" Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I'm like, \"Well, what if we put this over here?\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That's true.\n\nCeline Song: That can feel kind of fun.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's true.\n\nCeline Song: But I don't like the part of not knowing what the movie's going to be, but everybody's looking at you to believe in it. Because being a director is you're the center of the ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Captain of the ship.\n\nCeline Song: Captain of the ship. You need to be like, \"We know where we're going to go.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: But I do feel like sometimes I'll be like, \"I'm not sure I need a second to think about it,\" which I think is good to know that you can do that. You don't always have to pretend. I remember my dad saying that. Even he was like, \"Wait. I'm not sure I need to think about it.\" I was like, \"Well, if he can say that\" ... You don't have to always pretend everyone's looking at you. You don't have to pretend like you know what you're doing all the time.\n\nCeline Song: Yes. Of course.\n\nSofia Coppola: You can take a second to think about it and figure it out.\n\nCeline Song: Well, I feel there's such power in saying like, \"Well, I don't know yet.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. It takes more strength.\n\nCeline Song: I actually need some help figuring it out. It's so powerful because people want to help. People want to be a part of it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Maybe that helps not being a macho guy that you're okay to be like, \"I don't know. I need help.\" Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah. I mean, that was such a magical thing. I just want to help this.\n\nSofia Coppola: There’s lot people around helping you.\n\nCeline Song: I'm confused. Help me.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yes. Everyone helping you.\n\nCeline Song: It's great.\n\nSofia Coppola: I know. I was thinking I wanted you some time ... I'll ask you when we're not filming that I have an idea for a play, but I don't, I just have a concept. I have a setting. But I have no idea the rest of it. The audience is the screen and it's a family and all the dynamics between the family, it maybe it's a short one act play. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Well, I feel like you already know how it is. It's just more like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Who the characters are.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I love when the dynamics are ... It's like under the surface and you're saying one thing, but meaning another thing.\n\nCeline Song: Of course.\n\nSofia Coppola: Which I guess you just have to feel your way through it. That's the best kind of writing.\n\nCeline Song: Well, I feel like it's probably about what's away from the room.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, what's happening before and after. Or another ...\n\nCeline Song: I mean, just it's in another room. Because I feel like that's very Chekhovian to me what you're describing. I mean, death and shootings happen outside of the, what I would say a frame, which is the stage, outside of it is where all that drama happens.\n\nSofia Coppola: Think about what's happening outside of the moment?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Then you can conceal and reveal.\n\nSofia Coppola: People can come in and out.\n\nCeline Song: Easily.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's really helpful. There's one just dynamics with certain peers have issues with certain ones. But yeah, the real drama is happening outside of the frame.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Some of the drama can happen there. Then there's such power in somebody walking into the stage, which is of course the frame. If you've got to think about that as a frame, and you can only put the camera in one place. That's it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Right. What's happening outside of that.\n\nCeline Song: That's the whole frame. Yeah. It's the same logic. An actor entering into that space is so much more powerful then ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Because you're like ... yeah. It's a new person shows up.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah. It's so amazing. Everybody's just like ... the closeup or the focus is happening through blocking.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Just the person stepping. No one's moving and one person's stepping forward. That's equivalent of a closeup.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. When I was doing the stage, I was like, \"What do you do without a closeup?\"\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I know.\n\nSofia Coppola: It's a different thing. Oh, that's so interesting.\n\nCeline Song: Or they can be like, \"You can step into the light. There's so many ways that you can do the closeup that you can do the blocking.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's cool. That'd be fun when I think about that. Did you see that play Stereophonic?\n\nCeline Song: No.\n\nSofia Coppola: I saw it at Playwrights Horizon. It just closed. But it's coming to Broadway in March. You should go see that.\n\nCeline Song: Cool. I'll see that.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I loved it. My husband's a musician and it all takes place in a recording studio.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Okay. I want to go see this.\n\nSofia Coppola: They use what's happening in the room, and then behind the glass. It's based on Fleetwood Mac making “Rumors.” But the way the sound is ... I thought it was really cool.\n\nCeline Song: I love that. These are singing.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: That's great.\n\nSofia Coppola: Their voices are incredible. It sounds really corny because it's fake version of '70s Fleetwood Mac style music. It sounds like it'd be awful. But the music's really good.\n\nCeline Song: I'm sure it is.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was really impressive.\n\nCeline Song: Okay. I'm going to see it.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't see that much theater, but I love how they use the space.\n\nCeline Song:\n\nI think that's the thing about blocking. Blocking has to do all the storytelling and dialogue.\n\nSofia Coppola: In fact, that they had the glass partition, so you can't hear. You can turn the sound off and on in the different spaces. It was cool. But that's so helpful. Thank you for that.\n\nCeline Song: I think it's true. I think it's also, usually the difference that I think about is the time and space is so literal in film. If you want to have an old lady, then you need to cast an old lady. But in theater, you don't have to do any of that. A kid can show up and say, \"Well, I'm 92,\" and the whole audience is going to believe it.\n\nIf you want to make a movie set on Mars, you have to build Mars or go to Mars. But in theater, all you have to do is ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Have a rock.\n\nCeline Song: I can sit on a couch like this. Exactly. Not even a rock. Just turn the light a little red and then just be like, \"So I got to Mars,\" and then the whole audience will come with you to Mars.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so cool. That's fun to think about.\n\nCeline Song: That's the strength of it, I think.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I'm curious because it's so mysterious and unfamiliar to me. But ...\n\nCeline Song: I think you love it. It's true.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, thank you very much for that.\n\nCeline Song: Okay.\n\nSofia Coppola: I'm going to think for it. That's really helpful what you said about the stage. Okay. These are some questions I guess from people.\n\nCeline Song: Give me some, too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Okay. Is heartbreak necessary for a great love story? I think so. Yeah. I would say I feel like, I mean, all the great ones have heartbreak.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Because I feel like at the end of the day, love story is about the stories that are, I don't know, it's about the biggest drama of our lives.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You need some obstacle or hindrance or else it would be boring. All love stories have ...\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Boring.\n\nSofia Coppola: ... something to overcome.\n\nCeline Song: I think so. Because otherwise, then you're like, \"Well, what is it worthy of telling a story?\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Heartbreak is just romantic and it touches you in the deepest way, I think so. I feel like it's essential.\n\nCeline Song: Well, heart It's meant to be broken. That's how you grow, too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. All the love stories that I love always have a tragic side. Did you ever read Spring Snow by Mishima?\n\nCeline Song: Yes. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I felt like ... I love it. Okay. Do you want one to be yours?\n\nCeline Song: What's a genre you'd like to pursue more?\n\nSofia Coppola: I always thought it'd be fun to do science fiction as something that I would not know how to do.\n\nCeline Song: I want to see your science fiction so bad. Okay. Cool.\n\nSofia Coppola: What about you?\n\nCeline Song: I want to do Western.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that'd be cool.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. I think it'd be really cool.\n\nSofia Coppola: You could get women in it. I feel like Western ... I can't watch ones that are all guys, because I get them all mixed up.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. But I think the position of it, I feel like the macho of it and in the way that it gets subverted is always really amazing. Also, I like stories about just bravery.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It'd be cool. American West, it's such a tradition. I'd like to see your Western.\n\nCeline Song: It's also about fame. I feel like westerns are not fame, notoriety.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah.\n\nCeline Song: I think it's really interesting.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's cool. I would love to see your Western. Okay.\n\nCeline Song: I want to see your sci-fi so bad.\n\nSofia Coppola: Where is your favorite spot to write?\n\nCeline Song: It really is wherever I can. It truly is wherever I can. I don't have a favorite spot. I like the plane.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. Because no one can interrupt you.\n\nCeline Song: It's pretty good, right?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I do too.\n\nCeline Song: What about you?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I agree about the plane. Also, I think the lack of oxygen makes you feel like what you're writing is more exciting than it probably is. It's just like watching movies on the plane or ...\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: If you had to watch one movie scene every day for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's really hard. One scene. I don't know. Do you have one?\n\nCeline Song: I'm thinking.\n\nSofia Coppola: I know. I have a favorite scene that I revisit a lot, which is in Barry Lyndon. There's a scene where Marisa Berenson has a fur hood on, and he's smoking a cigar, and he’s blowing the smoke all over her, and she's really annoyed and he has no perception of her at all. It says so much in this one scene. It's a scene that I revisit a lot, and I looked at for when I was shooting a scene with Elvis and Priscilla in the limousine. They're disconnected. But it says so much and they don't say anything, and it's just ...\n\nCeline Song: I love that.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yes. That's one of my favorite scenes.\n\nCeline Song:\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nSofia Coppola: Do you have a scene that you revisit from time to time that you love?\n\nCeline Song: Feel like I think that there must be a scene in a Miyazaki film. Do you know what I mean? I bet that amazing scene in Howl's Moving Castle, where it's just this beautiful feel be on the door. We were just sitting there and just live there. I'm like, \"Well, that feels like heaven to me.\" If I had to live, I have to ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Live with the scene over and over.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Over and over. I'll just sit there and I'll just be like, \"I had a spa.\" It's amazing.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you watch the document ... There's one documentary I saw of him that was touching. So cool.\n\nCeline Song: He's so dour.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I love it.\n\nCeline Song: He's like, \"I'm sick of this.\" And I'm like, \"Me too.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: The best.\n\nCeline Song: Your movies are like a dream.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I'm glad he's good. Okay. This one says, how do you call action on your set if you do?\n\nCeline Song: I usually ask my AD to do it. Yeah. What about you?\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so funny because there was always a thing where you have to say it yourself. But I don't mind when we're a big loud thing for my AD to say it, or it's a small, quiet area.\n\nCeline Song: Totally. I usually give the AD the go. Go ahead. Because he's the one who's checking if everything's speeding and everything. He knows when to start.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You don't want to say it the wrong ... I've done it at the wrong time. Just excited me before this call.\n\nCeline Song: Me too. Yeah. I'm like, \"We're not ready.\" I'm like, \"Well, he knows when we're ready. He should just say when he can. You don't mind him.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: I think my dad always said, \"You have to say action. They know that you're the boss and say it loud.\" I'm in the habit of saying it. But I am happy for the AD, too, if we're outside and it's loud.\n\nCeline Song: Totally. Well, I feel like they know I'm the boss. You know what I mean? I'm like, \"I don't need to tell them. They know.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I guess I do out of habit.\n\nCeline Song: Totally. Just for you specifically.\n\nSofia Coppola: Okay.\n\nCeline Song: Would you ever consider directing a horror movie?\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. I would. But yeah, I haven't thought about it. But when I was a kid, we would make little video movies and we made horror movies, because it was just fun to get blood out. We lived in an old Victorian house. It felt very conducive to horror movies.\n\nCeline Song: I love that.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't really like gore, but ...\n\nCeline Song: I wrote a horror script, but I would get so spooked by my own. It had to be so scary. But it has to be scary to me. I don't know if it's scary to anybody else, but it's really scary to me.\n\nSofia Coppola: What's the premise? Can you say, are you going to tell me after? It's top secret?\n\nCeline Song: No. It's not top secret. I probably will never make it, because I'll be too scared to make.\n\nSofia Coppola: I want to see it. I know. I don't like super scary.\n\nCeline Song: I don't like it.\n\nSofia Coppola: What's the setting?\n\nCeline Song: It's not even wild. It's a totally conventional snowy cabin thing. But this cabin is fucked up and that's it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, it's the scary stuff that can happen. You're stuck in the ...\n\nCeline Song: It's just so scary. It's like going there and then this person acting like they know you. Then you realize that like, \"Yeah. I guess you're my cousin.\" You just buy it. Then eventually ...\n\nSofia Coppola: You stuck with a crazy ...\n\nCeline Song: Oh, then you're stuck with them. Then you just realize, \"I don't think this is my cousin.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, no.\n\nCeline Song: To me, that's the scariest thing.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, I used to always be scared of the Body Snatchers. I remember telling my brother when I was little ...\n\nCeline Song: So scary.\n\nSofia Coppola: ... like, \"Let's have a code word. If you're snatched, I'll know It's really you.\" But that Body Snatchers is really scary.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, my God. It's really scary. Really, it's like the person ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Closest to you taken over. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: When my child, and one of the scariest stories that I heard in Korea, which is it's like your mom starts laughing, and then your mom goes like, \"Do I look like your mom?\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. That's terrifying.\n\nCeline Song: That's so scary. I was too young. I was like, \"This is the scariest thing.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. That is.\n\nCeline Song: Anyway. That is. But anyway. Sorry.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don’t want to think about horror. What movie makes you cry every time?\n\nCeline Song: There was a time where, I don't know why, but Big Fish.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don’t think I saw that.\n\nCeline Song: It's a Tim Burton film.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. No. I never saw that.\n\nCeline Song: With Ewan McGregor?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: For some reason the ending of that, I think that would just kill me.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow. I never saw that movie, but I know why, I love his movies. I love them.\n\nCeline Song: I think you see it. But it's about ... I don't know. I think that it's ... I feel like weirdly children could never make me cry, but older people could.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. What about you?\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't know. I feel like on a plane, any movie will make me cry.\n\nCeline Song: The Transformers are crying.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. Anything. I know. I feel like ... Oh, I know. It's really embarrassing, my kids love that movie. It's called Instant Family about, like a rom-com, but they adopt some foster children and then yeah, embarrassing, crying at the end.\n\nCeline Song: I think family just is ... it's one of those things that you're just like.\n\nSofia Coppola: But it's like Terms of Endearment is the classic if you want to cry.\n\nCeline Song: Yes. Of course. Who doesn't cry at that? The performance too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Favorite film camera to use?\n\nCeline Song: I only used one. I don't know.\n\nSofia Coppola: It was digital, I imagine.\n\nCeline Song: No. No. It was 35-millimeter film Panavision.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's cool.\n\nCeline Song: You shot digital?\n\nSofia Coppola: I always love film. But Priscilla was shot digitally.\n\nCeline Song: Really?\n\nSofia Coppola: I have a newfound. I was like, \"Wow. You made it look beautiful.\" I always like to shoot film if I can. But we were in such a hurry. Yeah. I was impressed that it doesn't have that creepy digital feeling that's something going to ...\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I was so sure it was shot on film, your film.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I think film has a different quality to it, but that's the magic of Philippe Le Sourd, because a lot of times it has a digital look, but I don't know how he ...\n\nCeline Song: How It went away.\n\nSofia Coppola: ... made it beautiful.\n\nCeline Song: Because it really doesn't look digital at all. But I think some stories ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Sometimes I think it suits it. Yeah. I think it's harder with period films. But I liked Zone of Interest felt very crisp and digital to me. I don't know if it was.\n\nCeline Song: It was, I think.\n\nSofia Coppola: But I like that.\n\nCeline Song: But I think it's meant to be, I think. I feel like it depends on the, I really think ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It depends on the ...\n\nCeline Song: ... it depends on the film.\n\nSofia Coppola: But usually I think period films, you want to be on film, because it's in the past and digital feels more immediate. But that one isn't acceptable. Yeah. It gives ...\n\nCeline Song: That's what it was. I mean, I feel like the part of the shooting it on film was very much like, \"Well, what do I know? Never made a movie before.\" But my DP was talking to me about film. I think that it was a couple things. I was like, \"Well, I want my DP to have a process that he believes in.\" Every day, it's about the look of the whole film.\n\nSofia Coppola: He wanted to shoot on film?\n\nCeline Song: He wanted to shoot on film. We were both talking. He's like, \"Well, as long as we don't destroy the budget, we'll do it.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: It's not really costly.\n\nCeline Song: We fought for it. It's so different. But also, on top of that, I feel like the thing that I felt was like, \"Well, it speaks to the philosophy of the movie,\" which is that it is about the ephemeral or time made tangible. There's a part of it where it's like the chemistry of it or the ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. There's a little mystery.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Which I think is ... or uncertainty. You don't know how it's going to turn out that it spoke to what the movie is. I think that's how it should be.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I think the story depends on what and ... Yeah. I don't know what the favorite camera, usually. It's what the DP wants to use. I always work with people that I love and respect. You want them to guide how they think to their best.\n\nCeline Song: Totally. Well, I feel like my DP showed me things and I was like, \"I like that.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Totally. I know. That's such a great partnership. What album do you have on repeat right now?\n\nCeline Song: Oh, my God. The same question.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, is it a copy or do people ask that?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Maybe two people ask that. I feel like I've been listening to the Mitski's new album.\n\nSofia Coppola: Who?\n\nCeline Song: Mitski.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't know who that is.\n\nCeline Song: Mitski. I think you'll like it. Mitski has a new album, and I listened to that on repeat. I listened to Hozier, his new album on repeat.\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't know anything new.\n\nCeline Song: What do you listen to?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. This morning I was listening to Chet Baker, Let's Get Lost because it's winter and we're home.\n\nCeline Song: Makes sense.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. But yeah, I don't have one that I'm over and over listening to.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I know your husband is a musician. Does he recommend, or is it a thing where it's like intentionally it means it's like he recommends less? You know what I mean?\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, no. I feel bad because, I'm always asking to put music on. It's living with a music supervisor all the time. Oh, for this occasion, we make a playlist for a cocktail party or whatever. It's fun. Because I love music, it's fun to be with someone that knows a lot about music and has good taste, or I like their taste to music.\n\nCeline Song: I feel like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: It helps me with my soundtracks.\n\nCeline Song: That's amazing though.\n\nSofia Coppola: I can't remember the music. Did you have a score?\n\nCeline Song: We did. Chris Bear and Dan Rossen from Grizzly Bear. They scored it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you just like their music and asked them to do it or ...\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I love their music. But I feel like it was also the conversation that I had with them. Of course, one level, I'm like, \"I'm 35, I'm genuinely ... they're like gods to me.\" Grizzly Bear's just like that's my ... They're the one. It was on one level, I was just fangirling. But on the other level, I also was having to really have a conversation. Because of course you're like, \"Well, do they want to be a part of a process where they're not crafting an album?\"\n\nSofia Coppola: I'm sure that's exciting to them.\n\nCeline Song: I think it was.\n\nSofia Coppola: But did you have to tell them if you don't like something, was that hard?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: But it was fine.\n\nCeline Song: I mean, because again, everybody knows I'm the boss. I have to be like ... Sadly, I'm the boss and it's not an album. It's a movie.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. What I need.\n\nCeline Song: We have to work on it together.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I remember I liked the music. But I can't remember outside of that, which is good. I think that it supported the story.\n\nCeline Song: Of course. Well, I think that's what I really wanted more than anything. I think ...\n\nSofia Coppola: You want to be thinking about it?\n\nCeline Song: No. Also, you don't want it to lead the audience.\n\nSofia Coppola: I hate when scores are really dramatic telling you how to feel. It really bugs me.\n\nCeline Song: Because my thing is then I think that the audience shuts down. I, as an audience member, shut down.\n\nSofia Coppola: Stop telling me what I'm supposed to be. I hate that.\n\nCeline Song: I know. I think so I feel like it's like you want the emotion to get there, arrive, and then you want the music to start.\n\nSofia Coppola: To kind support that. But let them ...\n\nCeline Song: To support that, to fully let them give them permission. But I don't think that it's a thing where it's like, if music, it's literally a timing of is it six more frames or later or earlier.\n\nSofia Coppola: It makes a big difference.\n\nCeline Song: Makes a huge difference. If you give audience room to feel it for themselves and then you give them permission with score as opposed to time to cry.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah. No. I like when it has goosebumps.\n\nCeline Song: Do you want to cry?\n\nSofia Coppola: I like when it has a goosebump effect, which is usually after. But yeah. Yeah. I know I hate when it's ...\n\nCeline Song: I know. I'm so sensitive to it. How did you enjoy the sound design process? Because I found it ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, I love that. What time do you find it?\n\nCeline Song: I actually found it so intense for me. I was really obsessive. That's the only part where I think. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. I guess, I don't know, I've always loved that part because it's like all of a sudden it becomes a movie. It was a mess and it just makes such a huge difference, I think. Luckily, I have a family friend who's like an uncle who helped me with my first short film, and then I always worked with him. But he retired recently. It's the first time without him. I was like, \"Oh, no. I can't.\"\n\nI don't think about it, just trust him so much. But I don't know, I learned so much. Richard Banks, who's a legendary sound guy. I remember on Virgin Suicides, there's a scene where the priest comes to visit them and he gave them a squeaky shoe when he walks up the stairs. All these details that now I think about all the details you can add with the sound. Yeah. I love that process. It's still mysterious to me because it's not visual. But it's a little bit abstract.\n\nBut I just think even on Priscilla, it was like when the sound design happened, then all of a sudden, the movie came together and it felt like a movie where before it was just a bunch of scenes stuck together. It's really adds a huge…\n\nCeline Song: Music as well. I mean, my director's cut, I feel like I spend more time, even the director's cut before we do any of the sound design, I feel like I'm so obsessive about sounding the temp. I feel like I get obsessed with temp. Because I'm like, \"Yeah. But people have to see it.\" I don't want it to sound too crazy. I feel like in the sound design, I'm asking about the process, because I'm like, \"I was in that room for 14 hours every day.\" You know what I mean?\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You wouldn't think of that when you make a movie. Yeah. I guess, I don't know if I spend that much on, because I let them do their thing and then I review it. But my editor, Sarah Flack, who's great, is really good with the temp sound. She's really meticulous. It makes a huge difference of all the timing of all that. But I love that moment when you see it with the first mix, because it's like, \"Oh, it's not terrible.\" Somehow it magically comes….\n\nCeline Song: Totally. It's a movie.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It becomes a movie.\n\nCeline Song: It's a movie. It's really ...\n\nSofia Coppola: But it's hard to know. Don't you think it's hard to know when you're done editing or you just run out of time and money?\n\nCeline Song: No. I think it was clear.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. You're like, \"It's done.\"\n\nCeline Song: To me, I could tell. I'm like, \"I think we're good, or I think we're good after this one little thing.\" But I think it's because of the way that I was a writer for the longest time. I mean, I feel like knowing when to stop is part of the job. It's similarly with the editing, I was like, it's very like, \"I know we're done after this. If I do more, we're going to start cutting into the things that are good, too.\" I think that. But sound design, I think is a part where I didn't know when to stop. My sound designer, his nickname for me was Miss Dog Ears, because I would just find it ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Every detail.\n\nCeline Song: I'm driving towards a perfection there that is not going to be achieved.\n\nSofia Coppola: Insane.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Right. Because unless I have a million years, because also I hope it's not just me. But I just think that the sound is so subjective. Volume hasn't changed. But I listened to it the first time and I was like, \"It's too loud.\"\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It's weird how you trust your impression. After a while ...\n\nCeline Song: It's so scary\n\nSofia Coppola: I don't know. It seems these are too ... Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: It made me scared. Because I was like, \"I thought this whole scene was so loud.\" Now that I hear it and no adjustment has been made, it sounds fine.\n\nSofia Coppola: It sounds different. I feel like that's where you rely on your team, that you trust them because that's what they're totally focused on. That helps. But it is abstract and a strange part of it.\n\nCeline Song: It is. I think you're right. It's like when it sounds good. Still, all I hear is imperfections. But you have to ... There's a part of where you just have to let it go.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. It's true. There's one little thing. You have to tweak it or else it's going to bog you. But yeah, it is a weird part of it. But let's lock this all out. I've forgotten all of this. I think it's like you have to forget it all or else it seems too daunting.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: It's like going into writing a script, I forget about all the different steps you have to go through.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. You're just like, \"Well, yeah. I feel like a brand new.\" I totally get it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You just have to write a script and then figure out the rest later. Of course. I think it's helpful to be naive and less experienced because when you're doing it for the first time, you don't know all the steps. Now it's like, \"Oh.\" I think you forget it all. It's always just some discovery.\n\nCeline Song: Well, I think that's so amazing though. There's this word in Korean that's choshim, and it's like cho is first and shim is heart. It's about first heart. They talk about it. It's mainly the thing that people talk about in creative settings. It's about how you have to go back to choshim, as in ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Your first intuition, your first ...\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. It's like your first heart. It's less intuition. It's a little bit more like what you're talking about.\n\nSofia Coppola: Your first impression.\n\nCeline Song: You've forgotten everything. You're starting with the same heart.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. Like a fresh heart, a first heart.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Even when you're making your next movie, or what. I'm sure when you're making Priscilla, it's like there's a part of it where you're holding onto the side of it that was working on Virgin Suicides.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCeline Song: Right. You're like, \"I don't know how this is going to go.\" Or the mystery of it.\n\nSofia Coppola: Or the mystery. Yeah. That's a good word. How do you say it?\n\nCeline Song: Choshim.\n\nSofia Coppola: It means first heart.\n\nCeline Song: First heart.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, yeah. That's nice.\n\nCeline Song: I think about it a lot because I feel like even when you were asking about what do I think about the second film? Or hopefully like you, so many films. I think when you're there, I think the feeling has to always be like, \"Well, I have to hold onto the first heart of it because you can't do\" ... You know what I mean? Because you can't just think about ... I don't know. You cannot build it on the thing that you already made because it's always ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Always starting over.\n\nCeline Song: It has to be new. He's always starting over. I think that's what it is.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. Seen my dad's in his 80s and he's so excited about this movie he's working on.\n\nCeline Song: It's amazing.\n\nSofia Coppola: I feel like you're always starting over.\n\nCeline Song: You're always starting over.\n\nSofia Coppola: Which makes it exciting.\n\nCeline Song: But I think that's what makes you feel alive. Also, it makes your work feel alive, too.\n\nSofia Coppola: Definitely.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. It's not like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Same old…\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Exactly. The thing I've done. Because I think that'll make me so sad if I'm ever there. If I'm 80, and I'm just like, \"How many times have I made this movie?\" You want to be like ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Look at Miyazaki.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I know. I sometimes always felt like I'm doing the same story over and over again. But you're always trying to figure something out.\n\nCeline Song: No. But I feel like doing the same story over ... I think that's just naturally though. It's like Tennessee Williams. They're all different plays. But it's all about her sister.\n\nSofia Coppola: We all have our obsessions.\n\nCeline Song: Oh, yeah. Like Arthur Miller. It's all about, I guess, Marilyn Monroe. I think it's all about. But they're all different plays. But they are ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Did you study playwriting?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I got an MFA.\n\nSofia Coppola: Where?\n\nCeline Song: Columbia.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: I got an MFA for playwriting at Columbia.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, cool. Did you really meet your husband at a writing retreat, in the movie? I figured.\n\nCeline Song: Edward Albee Foundation.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Edward Albee has a ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I knew him when he was alive. He used to come to the barn. Me and my husband, we met him there.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so cool.\n\nCeline Song: It was really cool. Totally magical.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, wow. That's so cool.\n\nCeline Song: Then, yeah, I feel like it is this barn that he bought and that he just used to just bring his friends over. Spalding Gray was there. It's really cool.\n\nSofia Coppola: Wow. Now, it's a playwright's retreat?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. It's like artist retreat and they can go. If you're a painter, you can go, if you're a photographer, writer of any kind.\n\nSofia Coppola: I didn't know that. That's so cool.\n\nCeline Song: But there are a lot of those. You've been to McDowell?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I've never been to those. But I'm going to the Rome Academy in June. I always thought that would be fun. You and your husband have go live in Rome for a year.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I have artists, painter friends that have done it. I just thought, I have a fantasy that I'll go, too.\n\nCeline Song: You're going to do for a year?\n\nSofia Coppola: No. I'm not doing a residency. I'm just going to an event they're doing. But a friend that's a sculptor, we were like, \"Oh, let's both go for a year and live in Rome and make art.\"\n\nCeline Song: Sounds amazing.\n\nSofia Coppola: You guys could do that.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: Yeah. You check out the Rome Academy.\n\nCeline Song: Check it out. We'll check out. I feel like I went to lot of these artist residencies. They are pretty productive, I find.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's cool. Because with other people all making stuff.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. At dinner, you meet everyone and then ...\n\nSofia Coppola: They're different. They're not all writers.\n\nCeline Song: No.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so fun.\n\nCeline Song: Someone’s a composer, someone is choreographer. It's kind of like a really ...\n\nSofia Coppola: It's like summer camp.\n\nCeline Song: It's like summer camp. Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: That sounds cool. I'm going to look into that.\n\nCeline Song: I think you should.\n\nSofia Coppola: I have a friend that used to go to Yado.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Yado is haunted.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. Famously.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really? Do you know who the ghost is? Is it a writer?\n\nCeline Song: I think it's like ... Well, Yado is how this little girl ... We have very ghostly conversation. But there's a little girl who was the daughter who died. She used to call the whole place Yado, because she's trying to say shadow.\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, that's why it's called Yado.\n\nCeline Song: It's called for the Yado.\n\nSofia Coppola: I didn't know that.\n\nCeline Song: It's so wild. I mean, but I think just like our most haunted places, it's one of the most productive residencies I've been to. It's a funny way. There was a room where Truman Capote was working on something. I feel like maybe in Cold Blood even. Then I think he was 1,000% haunted. Everybody's just ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Oh, really?\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. There's ...\n\nSofia Coppola: That's good to write a ghost story there.\n\nCeline Song: It really is. I think it's one of the most productive.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's so cool.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah. I think haunted places are really productive.\n\nSofia Coppola: That's good to know. My friend who went ... as a writer, she said they would just leave a little basket with your food and you just have to think about anything.\n\nCeline Song: Yeah.\n\nSofia Coppola: I have to look into that.\n\nCeline Song: It's really nice. But McDowell is ... I think that's the best one ...\n\nSofia Coppola: Where's that?\n\nCeline Song: ... for me. It's all Upstate New York or a state nearby in New York.
