COVID-19 is an infectious disease with flu-such as symptoms including fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. The virus was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, and spread globally including Western Europe, North America, and Asia. Steps by national governments to contain the transmission have resulted in a decline in economic activity and restricted movement of goods and services with countries entering a state of 'lock down'. The outbreak had a negative impact on businesses throughout 2020 and into 2021. However, many media markets have been unaffected or benefited from this as they transmit their content remotely through digital channels. It is expected that the film and music market will recover from the shock across the forecast period as it is a 'black swanâ€™ event and not related to ongoing or fundamental weaknesses in the market or the global economy.\n\nRevolutionizing Animation How Motion Capture Technology Is Transforming Film And Music Production\n\nFilm and music production companies are increasingly adopting motion capture technology to reduce costs associated with key frame-based animations. Motion capture is the process of recording a live motion event and translating it into actionable data that allows a 3D recreation of the performance. To achieve these, performers need to wear reflective markers all over their bodies which are then interpreted by a computer and turned into digital 3D models. Through this technology, real-time results are achieved faster, and it also reduces the cost of key-frame animation. Some recent box-office blockbusters which incorporated motion capture technology include Avengers, Captain America, Beauty, and the Beast, Guardians, Iron Man, and others.\n\nHarmonizing Entertainment Warner Music Group Joins Forces With Sk Global Entertainment For Music Documentaries And Narrative Programming\n\nMajor companies operating in the TV and radio broadcasting market are focusing on strategic collaborations such as Warner Music Group with SK Global Entertainment to better meet the needs of their existing consumers.
