        "text": "Drama criticism is the comparison, analysis, interpretation, and/or evaluation of dramatic works.\n\nVarious reference works describe literary criticism as essentially an opinion, supported by evidence, relating to theme, style, setting, historical context, or political context.\n\nIt usually includes discussion of the work’s content and integrates your ideas with other insights gained from research.\n\nCriticism may have a positive or a negative bias and may be a study of an individual piece of drama or an author’s body of work.\n\nAlthough criticism may include some of the following elements in order to support an idea, criticism is NOT a plot summary, an author's biography, simply finding fault with the work.\n\nAcademic criticism should not be confused with a simple review of a play or performance. A review generally focuses only on the performance's enjoyability."
