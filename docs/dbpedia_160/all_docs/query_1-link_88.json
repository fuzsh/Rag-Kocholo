        "text": "Drama, popularly understood as a performing art, is one of the major modes of representation of fiction. Alternatively, drama is also a genre of visual and written media, used for comparatively serious narrative fiction. However, drama in literature is characterized by a narrative with dialogues and performance. Whether enacted in theatres, radio shows or incorporated into written media, drama is all around us. In this article, let’s learn briefly about the history, significance and different types of drama in literature!\n\nWhat is Drama?\n\nEtymologically, the word drama comes from the Greek word “draō” which means “to do/ to act”. Have you ever noticed two marks representing drama? These masks identified with drama illustrate the classic conventional distinction between comedy and tragedy.\n\nDrama, to this day, remains a precious art of collaborative production and reception, performed at a theatre for an audience. You might have enjoyed one yourself. However, it wouldn’t be exaggerating to say that this art is slowly fading off. We have neglected the art too much but there’s still time. The importance of theatre art should be inculcated in everyone, whether children or adult.\n\nThere are many different forms of drama, including mime, closet drama, improvisations, musicals, opera and others. Some of these forms have found their way into a dramatic literary corpus. For example, a closet drama refers exactly to what was written for reading, not performance. Others are specifically performative drama such as mime. It refers to a theatrical performance of gestures and suggestions of emotions and actions without the use of dialogues.\n\nIn simple words, hence, drama in literature is a performance of a narrative with dialogues, performed sometimes with dance and music according to a script. This script in a written form is widely read and enjoyed.\n\nHistory of Drama in Literature\n\nAncient Greeks\n\nAs you can already guess, we can trace drama straight back to Ancient Greece, where Western drama originated. The cultural city of Athens mainly produced three types of drama– tragedy, comedy and satyr play. The exact origin of drama, or plays is obscure, as is the custom for so many cultural traditions.\n\nHowever, drama as a mode of celebration was institutionalised in Athens in the 5th century BC through competitions to honour the God Dionysus. From the ancient period, only the works of a few dramatists remain to this day.\n\nSome of them are:\n\nThe tragedians\n\nAeschylus,\n\nSophocles,\n\nEuripides\n\nThe comic writers\n\nAristophanes\n\nMenander.\n\nAncient Romans\n\nNext comes, yes, you guessed it right, Rome!\n\nThe Romans came across Greek drama when they captured several territories of the Ancient Greece in the 3rd century BC. By means of the Roman Empire, the art of drama spread far and wide. However, few works survive of the Roman dramatists.\n\nMedieval Period\n\nIn the medieval period, churches took it upon themselves to popularize drama by encouraging enactments of biblical events.\n\nThese types of drama would require two groups to sing in Latin and by the 11th century, this type of drama spread through the whole of Europe and even Russia.\n\nIn the middle ages, plays were generally religious in thematic contexts because they served as important means of disseminating religious codes and education. However, secular and morality plays were also popular.\n\nElizabethan Period\n\nThe 16th and 17th century England was perhaps the most important period for drama. At this time, most plays were written in verses in iambic pentameter. It is a type of metric line used in poetry and verse drama. It specifies the rhythm or meter in a particular line. In addition to William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton and Ben Jonson are important playwrights of this period. The themes of such plays were largely drawn from the mythology of Ancient Greece or Roman mythology.\n\nEnglish Restoration Comedies in the period of the 17th and 18th centuries were also popular, bringing on the renaissance of English drama in literature. Stealing from Greeks, Romans and other European counterparts, sexual explicitness, urbane, cosmopolitan wit, current topical literature, and dense, busy storylines marked English Restoration Comedies.\n\nDuring the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, William Congreve and John Vanbrugh’s “softer” plays sought to appeal to a more socially diversified audience with a large middle-class element, as well as female viewers.\n\nModern and Post-Modern Period\n\nInnovative branches of drama led by Norwegian Henrik Ibsen and German Bertolt Brecht marked the 19th and 20th centuries. These plays were marked by realist and modern, experimental themes, social critique. Some important playwrights of this period are George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Miller, Antonin Artaud and others.\n\nDramatic Expression\n\nExpression of drama, or the language of drama stems from the understanding and context of the text depicted. Different types of drama in literature have different expressions. It can be ritualistic and exaggerated or parallel the motion pictures. Britannica mentions the authors of ancient Greek ceremonial theatre who wrote in verses, and it is thought that their performers delivered this in an incantatory manner midway between speech and song. The result of such rhythmic word delivery was to raise the tone of the entire theatre to that of religious adoration.\n\nA poem accompaniment makes the performers’ highly stylized system of symbolic movements of head and eyes, arms and fingers a harmonic totality in Indian play. The tragic soliloquy in Shakespeare allowed the hero, alone on stage with the audience, to evaluate his thoughts aloud in the persuasive terms of poetry.\n\nWhat is Drama in Literature?\n\nDrama is strongly linked to literature, so much so that the two are practically inseparable. For an instance, the play Hamlet has both dramatic and literary value.\n\nDrama can reach an audience in two ways\n\nby way of hearing\n\nby way of sight.\n\nConsequently, drama is broadly of two types:\n\nthe drama of action\n\nthe drama of literature.\n\nDrama of literature or closet drama\n\nDialogues and scenes are written particularly to appeal to the reader.\n\nIn this, dramatists follow the narrative via written performance and build tension around the plot.\n\nFor an instance, let’s take Hamlet. We keep on wondering whether Prince Hamlet will ever revenge his father’s death and free himself of his bothersome ghosts and visions of floating daggers by slaying the play’s antagonist Claudius.\n\nTypes of Drama in Literature\n\nThere are 7 types of drama in literature to bring out the narrative. These are:\n\nComedy\n\nFarce\n\nTragedy\n\nTragi-Comedy\n\nMelodrama\n\nOpera\n\nMusical\n\nLet’s look at each of them!\n\nDrama Type – Comedy\n\nComedy is a type or genre of drama that is intended to make people laugh. However, humour is not the only quality that signifies a comedy. The main themes of a comedy are-\n\nThe tone is lighthearted.\n\nIngenious wordplay or twists of phrases.\n\nSerious issues are addressed in a lighthearted manner.\n\nMisunderstandings are amusing.\n\nA happy ending.\n\nCharacters who are silly and out of the ordinary.\n\nUsually concludes with a wedding, especially in romantic comedies.\n\nThe sub-genres of comedy include romantic comedies, sentimental comedies and others. William Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing” is one of the most famous instances of comedy. With smart banter and more than a few stupid misunderstandings, Beatrice and Benedick go from enemies to lovers. And, as is customary in Shakespearean comedies, it concludes with a wedding!\n\nAnother Shakespearean comedy is “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. This romantic comedy addresses one of his favourite themes, “love conquers all,” with a funny twist. Young couples continually fall in and out of love as a result of a sequence of humorous and surprising events. Their equally humorous real-world problems are magically solved by a mischievous sprite named Puck as they tackle the flaws of love. Old enemies will soon become friends, and truly loved ones will meet again to live happily at Shakespeare’s happy ending.\n\nFarce\n\nFarce is another type of drama in literature which is, broadly humorous, however, there are significant differences between a comedy and a farce. The main themes of farce are-\n\nExaggerated wit\n\nJokes that are slapstick\n\nThe plot is illogical.\n\nUnexpected occurrences\n\nHumor is frequently coarse and inappropriate.\n\nThe play “Waiting for Godot” by Samuel Beckett is a case on point. But, The plot revolves around two guys, Vladimir and Estragon. The men wait beneath a tree for Godot, a mystery figure. We do discover, though, that Godot continually sends word that he would arrive the next day, but this never happens. In other words, nothing happens with any surety in this drama.\n\nDrama Type – Tragedy\n\nTherefore, tragedies are one of the most common and popular types of drama. As you can probably guess, tragedies tend to be sad. However, there is more to tragedies than that. The main themes are-\n\nA fatal fault in the protagonist\n\nSituations that easily spiral out of control — and not in a good way\n\nHuman agony, hate, or poverty are frequent topics. These are darker topics than in a melodrama.\n\nDescribes the demise of a once heroic or well-liked persona.\n\nAn unredeemable conclusion in which one or more characters die\n\nArrives at a terrible catharsis\n\nShakespeare offers a plethora of tragedies from which to pick. Few, however, can compare to “Othello” in terms of its vicious villain, tragic demise of its hero, and heartbreaking denouement. Because he doesn’t believe he deserves the life he has, Othello loses everything he has ever loved or desired.\n\nTragi-Comedy\n\nThese complex among the types of drama in literature. They are more than just tragedy and comedy blended together. The main themes are-\n\nA serious plot delivered in a funny, sarcastic, or snarky manner.\n\nCharacters with tragic flaws whose acts do not result in death\n\nA confusing subject\n\nCharacters with broad personalities that act in stereotypically humorous ways\n\nThere is no joyful or funny conclusion.\n\nClassic plays were primarily concerned with clear-cut comedy, tragedy, or melodramatic genres. Tennessee Williams’ “A Streetcar Named Desire” contains enough comedic aspects to keep it from being classified as a tragedy – yet no one can argue that Blanche DuBois is anything other than a terribly broken character. It is the epitome of modern tragicomedy.\n\nDrama Type – Melodrama\n\nMelodramas are an exaggerated kind of drama in literature, in which conventional one-dimensional characters such as heroes, heroines, and villains contend with exciting, passionate, and frequently deadly situations. The main themes of melodrama are-\n\nCharacter clichés include heroes, heroines, villains, mentors, and so on.\n\nRomantic or sombre stories with sweeping arcs\n\nPlots and events that are larger-than-life (or very small stories told in big ways)\n\nCharacter reactions are exaggerated\n\nClearly defined literary topics\n\nCharacter flaws must be overcome in order to attain a resolution\n\nEnding that is sometimes cheerful and sometimes sad\n\nWhen referring to melodrama, take Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House”. Nora’s exaggerated emotions place the piece squarely in the category of melodrama. WOW!! The finale is a blend of Nora’s delight and hope and Torvald’s melancholy and despair. Sometimes called “tear-jerkers”, another example of such melodramas is the play “The Glass Menagerie” by Tennessee Williams.\n\nOpera\n\nMany a time, people don’t understand the difference between opera and musicals. An opera is a type of drama where the actors sing the lines or dialogues instead of speaking them. Also, the main themes of an opera are-\n\nArias, which are actually musical soliloquies.\n\nPlot-driving sequences that may or may not be melodious\n\nA libretto (text) that has been turned to music.\n\nTragic, comic, or melodramatic subject matter\n\nMay have a dancing aspect, but mostly depends upon vocal performances\n\nSet design, costume design, and production\n\nGiacomo Puccini’s “La Boheme” is one of the most famous operas of all time. It portrays the sad narrative of Rodolfo and Mimi, as well as the world of French Bohemia. The drama unfolds over the course of a year, set to one of opera’s most unforgettable compositions.\n\nDrama Type – Musical\n\nMusicals are different from opera. While lines in opera are sung, dialogues in musicals are infused with music and performances. The main themes of musicals are-\n\nFirstly Songs break up periods of conventional plot.\n\nCharacters frequently sing in unison to express their emotions.\n\nSongs as plot-altering devices\n\nStorylines that be dramatic or hilarious\n\nA memorable and unique musical score\n\nFrequently a lot of singing and dancing.\n\nMany musicals, such as “Les Miserables” and “Phantom of the Opera” are based on larger literary works. Both of these musical dramas communicate their topics directly via song and use musical sequences to advance the story. They simplify their original material by focusing on the most vital characters and plot components.\n\nInteresting Facts About Greek Drama and Theater\n\nThe term “theatre” is derived from the Greek word “theatron,” which means “seeing place.”\n\nThe masks allowed a single actor to play multiple roles in the same play.\n\nThe skene was a structure behind the orchestra. The skene was where actors changed their costumes. To create the background, pictures were sometimes hung from the skene. This is the origin of the term “scene.”\n\nThe chorus would occasionally comment on the characters in the play or warn the hero of impending danger.\n\nA man named Thespis was the first actor. Actors are sometimes referred to as “Thespians” nowadays.\n\nAncient Greece is where the drama masks that have come to symbolise theatre first appeared. The two masks represent the two main genres of Greek theatre, Comedy and Tragedy.\n\nIn ancient Greece, tragedy, a genre that focuses on human suffering, was the most popular theatrical form. Thespis, a playwright and actor, is credited with the first performance of tragedy at the Dionysia.\n\nParting Thoughts\n\nDrama in literature is an ancient art, that we should preserve.
