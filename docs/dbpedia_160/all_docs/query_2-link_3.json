        "text": "If you look at P!ink song you will see that this is regular song making process. It wasn't song made for movie.\n\nThe difference is that instead of making a decision at the production stage that the score will be written by particular artist (Like Zimmer/Huey Lewis),the director, producer, or studio exec will say, \"You know what would be good? If we use this song in this place or this song to promote the whole movie.\" For example, when the Exec is from the same company that is involved in making a movie and producing the music, then he will say, \"We have this new artist here, it would be nice if they did the song. We will write it to promote this movie\".\n\nMusic per se is rarely pre-made for a movie. By this I mean that original score doesn't exist until some pre-cut of the movie is made. Then the chosen composer, musical supervisor or director sits down, watches the movie, and thinks about the music.\n\nSometimes directors/screenwriters have certain song attributed to certain scenes in a movie (like Tarantino does or when in BTTF Johnny B. Good), but this not something you are interested in.\n\nSo - people who can say something about music chosen for movie, choose from very large library of music and decide that some score need to be done specifically for this movie. Sometimes they decide that such song exists, but must be remade to better suit the movie (See Trent Reznor Immigrant Song cover). And they have A LOT of knowledge of music and artists (there are schools specifically for those) and they propose that, for example, King of MetalRock should make some songs.\n\nWith large corporations, like Sony, it's just easier, cheaper, and faster to write songs, get them to perform with one of the top 10 artist they have contract with, and just earn more money on the whole marketing machine. After all, it's two horses pulling one cart."
