        "text": "Distributed by: Warner Bros.\n\nDirected by: Chris Columbus\n\nWritten by: Steve Kloves (based on “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” by J.K. Rowling)\n\nStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, Ian Hart, John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters\n\nThe track that proves it: “Hedwig’s Theme”\n\nBy this point in his career, Williams had created the soundtrack to the childhoods of at least two generations of moviegoers, so why not a third? Few pieces of music are more burned into the psyches of Millennials that his central theme for “Harry Potter.” Williams stepped back from the “Potter” franchise after 2004’s “The Prisoner of Azkaban,” but it’s still his music — dusted with magic and melancholy — that resonates throughout the franchise.\n\n-Adam B. Vary\n\nDistributed by: Columbia Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Steven Spielberg\n\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon, François Truffaut\n\nThe track that proves it: “Wild Signals”\n\nWilliams imbues much of Steven Spielberg’s first movie about aliens visiting Earth with an eerie, unsettling tension — lightyears away from his music for the other sci-fi classic he scored in 1977. Really, though, this movie is all about the climactic musical feast at the end, when humans and extra-terrestrials converse in a wondrous dialogue of complex variations on Williams’ iconic five-tone motif: Dah-dah-daah-DAH-DAAAAHHHHH.\n\n-Adam B. Vary\n\nDistributed by: 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios)\n\nDirected by: Chris Columbus\n\nWritten by: John Hughes\n\nStarring: Macaulay Culkin, Catherine O’Hara, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard\n\nThe track that proves it: “Somewhere in My Memory”\n\nIt’s so difficult for a holiday-themed movie to stand on its own outside of the traditional times of the year that it’s watched. Chris Columbus’ classic that made Macaulay Culkin one of the biggest stars on the planet is glued together by John Williams’ sleigh bells and quintessential suites. Here, he creates one of the finest Christmas scores ever.\n\n-Clayton Davis\n\nDistributed by: Paramount Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas, Philip Kaufman\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott\n\nThe track that proves it: “The Miracle of the Ark”\n\nThere’s action and adventure sprinkled all throughout the classic film starring Harrison Ford as the charismatic Indiana Jones. What’s so brilliant about Williams’ musical notes here are his methods to drum up suspense and downright terror, especially in the film’s big moment of opening the ark. And if you were a kid like me when this film came out, you watched that moment with your eyes closed, so only the music is pronounced in your memory.\n\n-Clayton Davis\n\nDistributed by: Universal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Steven Zaillian (based on “Schindler’s Ark” by Thomas Keneally)\n\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, Embeth Davidtz\n\nThe track that proves it: “Main Theme”\n\nWilliams’ score is an integral piece of Spielberg’s Oscar-winning masterpiece depicting the atrocities of the Holocaust. The film’s examination of the best parts of humanity found in one of civilization’s darkest hours is undoubtedly emotional, held within the cor anglais and violins that rest upon its most impactful scenes. If you ever feel like a good cry, watch Simone Lamsma and Davida Scheffers’ performances with the Dutch orchestra – a daughter and mother playing together for the first time after Scheffers suffered a neuromuscular condition that prevented her from playing music.\n\n-Clayton Davis\n\nDistributed by: Warner Bros.\n\nDirected by: Richard Donner\n\nWritten by: Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, Robert Benton (based on “Superman” by Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster)\n\nStarring: Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Margot Kidder, Valerie Perrine, Maria Schell, Terence Stamp, Phyllis Thaxter, Susannah York\n\nThe track that proves it: “Prelude and Main Title March”\n\nThis is Williams at his most unabashedly cornball, and it is glorious: a lushly symphonic score that is all about wonder and uplift and big, big, BIG themes that charge forward with an old-fashioned earnestness that perfectly fits the superhero at its center. Even Clark Kent and Lois Lane’s love theme is confidently sentimental. The poster tagline for this movie was “You’ll believe a man can fly,” and Williams’ soaring score is one big reason why.\n\n-Adam B. Vary\n\nDistributed by: Universal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Michael Crichton, David Koepp (based on “Jurassic Park” by Michael Crichton)\n\nStarring: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck, BD Wong, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards\n\nThe track that proves it: “Main Theme”\n\nThere was little doubt that Williams would bring the appropriate degree of overwhelming astonishment to the sight of dinosaurs walking amongst humans. But perhaps there’s no better way to put what he pulled off here than how Twitter user @PinkRangerLB did in December:\n\nSteven Spielberg: “I need a song for my dinosaur movie.”\n\nJohn Williams: “Cool, I’m going to write the most beautiful song in the entire world.”\n\n-Adam B. Vary\n\nDistributed by: Universal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Melissa Mathison\n\nStarring: Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore\n\nThe track that proves it: “Toys”\n\nJust writing this blurb risks collapsing into a puddle of tears — such is the indelible power of Williams’ near constant music for one of Spielberg’s most enduring classics. It’s as if Williams managed to burrow inside the hearts of Elliott (Henry Thomas) and the wide-eyed alien who befriends him, and bring us all inside the creation of their powerful emotional bond. The final moments of this movie, when Elliott and E.T. say goodbye to each other, contains some of the most stirring and poignant music ever put to film. Yup. Crying all over again.\n\n-Adam B. Vary\n\nDistributed by: Universal Pictures\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb (based on “Jaws” by Peter Benchley)\n\nStarring: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Grey, Murray Hamilton\n\nThe track that proves it: “Main Title”\n\nWith two simple notes, John Williams created one of the most terrifying and recognizable themes of all time. Blended with mystery and suspense, the score also depicts the whimsical nature of the beach and vacationing. All of this leads to one of cinema’s most ferocious villains to grace the screen: the man-eating great white shark. Better known as “Bruce,” he now sits in the Academy Museum, after being found in a junkyard.\n\n-Clayton Davis\n\nDistributed by: 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios)\n\nDirected by: George Lucas\n\nWritten by: George Lucas\n\nStarring: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness\n\nThe track that proves it: “Main Title”\n\nThe master has scored all nine of the “Star Wars” films. While all distinct, if operated separately, five of them would be indisputable inclusions on this list – “A New Hope” (1977), “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), “The Phantom Menace” (1999), “The Force Awakens” (2015) and “The Last Jedi” (2017). His inaugural outing in the 1977 classic, with an bombastic opening brass melody, could be easily considered the single best movie score in history. You can debate that amongst yourselves.\n\n-Clayton Davis"
