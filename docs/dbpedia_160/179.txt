Not every movie soundtrack has to go as hard as it does. The best soundtracks exist outside of the movie, giving you all the feels without all the *drama.* It's like a specially curated mixtape (aka a playlist, duh) from your favorite movie to you. There's often that one, epic song the movie's known for—the one that plays over the end credits and sends you out of the movie theater with a smile on your face—but there are also hidden gems that maybe only get a few lines in the film but are utter bangers in their own right. Movie soundtracks = an underrated way to find new music!

Important note: This list doesn't include scores, which are instrumental songs crafted specifically to pair with movie scenes (think: John Williams, Michael Giacchino, Hans Zimmer, and more of the greats that beef up our favorite movies). As my husband likes to say, a favorite movie score is for listening with the windows up while you're driving so you can appreciate the gorgeous sounds and probably cry. A favorite movie soundtrack is for listening in your car with the window open while you're driving so you can sing along. We're aiming for the latter with these bbs.
