        "text": "Kennedy Catholic Preparatory School has maintained a visible presence in Catholic education for over 50 years. Our school sits on a sprawling 64-acre campus in the bucolic town of Somers, NY, and stands as both a geographic and socioeconomic microcosm of the 60 New York State and Connecticut school districts, in addition to those from our international program, represented in our student population of 600 students.\n\nFounded in 1966 as the successor to St. Maryâ€™s High School in Katonah, Kennedy Catholic has continued to serve the educational needs of young men and women seeking a Christian, faith-driven academic setting in northern Westchester.\n\nAs a four-year college preparatory school enriched and enlivened by its Catholic identity, Kennedy helps form and deliver well educated, compassionate, articulate students to the world. Diocesan priests, deacons, sisters and lay men and women constitute the well-rounded faculty and staff of the Kennedy Catholic community."
