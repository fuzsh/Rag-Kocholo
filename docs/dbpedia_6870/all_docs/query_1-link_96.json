        "text": "TUITION\n\nA Catholic school education is a significant investment and commitment for any family. While every effort is made to keep tuition costs at a reasonable level, tuition is subject to increase each year. Kennedy Catholic depends on tuition, fundraising and conservative stewardship of our resources to maintain financial stability and viability. Our Finance Committee undertakes an annual review of tuition and fees which includes a current market survey. We believe a Kennedy Catholic education is the best value available in the Seattle and surrounding area.\n\nDuring the annual review process, we are guided by Verso L'alto and Five Year Financial Plan to effectively identify, plan and prioritize our resources and opportunities to not only sustain but also grow the school to meet the needs of our students and families. We receive no financial support or funding from the Archdiocese of Seattle, parishes or from the state. We encourage families to apply for assistance.\n\nKennedy Catholic High School is committed to making tuition affordable for students from all economic backgrounds through need-based tuition assistance grants. 45% of the student population receives some form of assistance. Tuition assistance awards are reviewed annually. It is our goal to offer continuing support as long as financial circumstances require. Decisions regarding admission to the school and eligibility for tuition assistance are made independently. We encourage families to apply. Kennedy Catholic offers tuition assistance distributed in the form of direct tuition assistance grants.\n\nParents/guardians are required to complete a minimum of 20 hours of volunteer service to the school per family (10 hours for single parent households) if receiving tuition assistance. Hours will be tracked independently by parents/guardians and submitted electronically at the end of each school year. If no hours are completed or submitted, future tuition assistance may be reduced or held.\n\nRequests for tuition assistance closed on December 31. Late applications are considered on a funds available basis."
