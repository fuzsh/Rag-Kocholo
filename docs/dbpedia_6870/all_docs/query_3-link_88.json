        "text": "Published Jan. 26, 2021.\n\nDuring the first 230 years of history of the United States, the great majority of the nation’s presidents were members of Christian churches other than Catholic; most were Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, or Baptist.\n\nJoe Biden is the second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy’s brief term sixty years ago. That alone made the 2020 U.S. election historically notable, distinctive in both the political and religious history of the United States.\n\nBut in addition to this, another set of circumstances made it an extraordinary election: Biden was elected during the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, after months of nationwide protests against racially motivated violence, and following a presidential administration that threatened and struck real blows against the rule of law and world order.\n\nAll this was happening while the newly elected president’s own Church has endured internal divisions among its American members like no other church and like never before in modern history.\n\nBiden’s presidency arouses not only political expectations but also religious, even salvific ones in the context of a global health emergency. This Catholic president is now called upon to heal the moral and physical damage inflicted upon the nation by Trump, the pandemic, and globalization.\n\nHe is the fourth Catholic to run for the American presidency (besides Kennedy, after Al Smith in 1928 and John Kerry in 2004). It is an office that is political but also moral and religious, and he begins it in a moment of delicate transition for both the nation and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe election of a Catholic to the presidency has historical value not only because this is only the second time it has happened but also because it allows us to closely examine the Catholic question in the United States: What does it mean to be both Catholic and American?\n\nThroughout American history, in ways not faced by members of other Christian churches, Catholics have had to engage in a certain kind of negotiation and mediation with their own Church, both on the national level and in terms of their relationship with the Vatican.\n\nBiden’s election is part of a particular historical moment of acceleration in the cultural and religious diversification of the country, including its politicians. This was evident in the swearing-in ceremonies of the new members of Congress in January 2019.\n\nWhile many were sworn in as they held their hands on the traditional Christian Bible, others among the new elect swore on the Koran, the Hebrew Bible, the Vedas of Hinduism, or the Buddhist Sutras.\n\nBut this is also a particularly Catholic moment. Biden’s election is the culmination of a rise of Catholics in American political life. As of January 20, 2021, the president of the United States, the Speaker of the House, the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and five other Supreme Court justices (six out of nine in all) are Catholic.\n\nTo be sure, the clear division of Catholics into two different ideological and political camps means that any talk of a Catholic takeover in America is misplaced. Catholicism has come far in two centuries in the context of the nation’s political life, but it is also very different from what it was at the time of John Kennedy.\n\nFor the first Catholic president, his being Catholic was a problem for important sectors of the Protestant establishment of the nation; for the second one, the country has no problem with his being Catholic, but a not insignificant segment of the American Church—from among its bishops, its clergy, and its faithful—has a problem with his Catholicism.\n\nHaving won numerous elections as a senator since 1973, two national elections to the vice presidency (2008 and 2012), and now one as president in 2020, Joe Biden lacks no political legitimacy. And yet significant sectors of the Catholic (and otherwise Christian) electorate question his moral legitimacy.\n\nIn the political history of the United States, Biden was not the first Catholic to run for or be elected to the presidency, but he is the first to do so while rising above and overcoming deep divisions within the American Catholic Church.\n\nFrom the point of view of popular culture, as a Catholic president, Biden follows the most famous president in entertainment history, the fictional Jed Bartlet of \"The West Wing\", the television drama conceived by Aaron Sorkin that aired for eight seasons (1999–2006) on NBC.\n\nAn economist, Nobel laureate, and University of Notre Dame alumnus, the Bartlet character— played and, at least in his Catholicism, modeled by the Catholic actor Martin Sheen—never had to deal with the political and religious polarization within U.S. Catholicism that exists today.\n\nBartlet’s liberal and at the same time devoted Catholicism is not unlike Biden’s. But the American Catholicism depicted in \"The West Wing\" is closer to Kennedy’s—at ease with the mainstream, ambivalent about the morality of abortion and the death penalty, but with ambivalence that remains on the level of individual conscience rather than fueling fundamental divisions within the Church or between the Church and society.\n\nIt is Catholicism as it was before the neoconservative and neo-traditionalist storm that was developing at the time depicted in the show and that has now reached a new theological, cultural, and political stage. It’s the long wave and the American Catholic version of the“revenge of God” about which Gilles Kepel wrote three decades ago.\n\nIn a country where political faiths have taken on a theological and dogmatic intensity, the renewed consideration of America as a political and moral project sees in American Catholicism a particular case study, one that includes convulsions within the body of the Church that reflect the external crisis of globalization and world order.\n\nAt the same time, there is a national context: Why does the election of a Catholic president deserve so much attention?\n\nOn one hand, there is the visible role that Biden’s Catholicism played in this election. One struggles to keep track of the times in which he, as a candidate, made direct or indirect references to his Catholicism.\n\nIn his speech to the nation on December 14, after the certification of the electoral college vote, Biden concluded by referring to the prayer popularly connected to St. Francis of Assisi:\n\n“So, as we start the hard work to be done, may this moment give us the strength to rebuild this house of ours upon a rock that can never be washed away, as in the prayer of Saint Francis, for where there is discord, union, where there is doubt, faith, where there is darkness, light. This is who we are as a nation. This is the America we love. And that is the America we are going to be. So, thank you all. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops and all those who stand watch over our democracy.\"\n\nIn his pre-Christmas speech, delivered on December 22, Biden quoted the German Jesuit Alfred Delp, an important figure in the Catholic resistance against Hitler, executed by the Nazis in February 1945, at the age of thirty-seven:\n\n“He wrote, ‘Advent is a time for rousing.’Delp believed, at first, we are shaken to our depths, and then we’re ready for a season of hope. As a nation, we’ve certainly been shaken to our depths this year. Now it’s time to wake, to get moving, a time for hope. We’ve gotten through tough times before in this nation. We’ll get through these difficult times as well. We’ll do it by coming together, by working with one another.”\n\nBiden made his Catholic faith a central part of the campaign, and he proved once again that Catholicism has a prominent place in the American project—a political, civil, social, and cultural project.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a Catholicism that has found itself in conflict in a variety of ways and at various times on some key issues in public life in the United States."
