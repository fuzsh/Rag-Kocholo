        "text": "Although it can only be viewed from above with the benefit of hindsight, and both families wouldn’t know it at the time, both the Kennedys and Fitzgeralds set upon their own path towards the American dream.\n\nBoth families came to American as regular laborers, peddlers, coopers and manual workers but the arrival of each new generation brought about an increase in fortune and standing in society.\n\nPeddlers and coopers gave way to retailers, clerks and tavern owners and they in turn eventually gave way to politicians, ambassadors and finally the highest seat of them all, the President of the United States of America.\n\nThroughout all of this both families, and JFK’s parents Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, retained a deep sense of heritage, “Irishness” and connection to their Catholic faith.\n\nThis manifested in all manner of ways but included JFK visiting Ireland for the first time in 1947 long before the glare of cameras and worldwide attention documented his 1963 summertime visit. Local folklore has it that the future President tracked down his long-lost relatives in Dunganstown, arrived at their farm in Wexford and simply introduced himself as “young cousin John from Massachusetts”."
