        "text": "School in Burien, , Washington, United States\n\nKennedy Catholic High School previously known as John F. Kennedy Catholic High School is a private, day and boarding, college-prep, Catholic high school in Burien, Washington, located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle.\n\nProfile\n\n[edit]\n\nKennedy Catholic was established in 1966 and is one of three Diocesan-operated high schools in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle. Kennedy Catholic was originally known as John F. Kennedy Memorial High School, but changed its name with the beginning of the 2009/2010 academic year in order to reflect its Catholic roots.[1]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Program\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen in school, students have the opportunity to earn up to 65 college credits, and are also able to be a part of the Honors Program which includes studies in religion, the arts, English, world languages, math, social studies and science. All these programs are coordinated through the Aquinas Honors Department at Kennedy Catholic.\n\nKennedy Catholic provides college credit classes through four sources: the Seattle University's Matteo Ricci College, the University of Washington, Seattle University, and the Advanced Placement Program.\n\nSaint Teresa of Calcutta Program\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint Teresa of Calcutta students take mainstream classes as needed.\n\nTeachers certified in special education\n\nLow student/teacher ratio\n\nSpeech therapy\n\nDiagnostic/academic testing\n\nDirect instruction\n\nSocial/study skills\n\nModified classes in algebra, basic math, biology, earth science, English, geometry, life skills, practical law, Spanish, study skills, U.S. history and world history\n\nAfter-school tutoring\n\nStudent tracking\n\nSAT modified testing\n\nInternational program\n\n[edit]\n\nProvides an academic year for foreign students who wish to study in the United States. All international students attending Kennedy High School must reside in the dormitory or with a guardian or host family. No student, regardless of age, may reside alone.\n\nCurrently there are 85 students from 11 different countries attending Kennedy.\n\nMinistries\n\n[edit]\n\nKOOCS (Kids Offering Others Care and Support) – Cook breakfast and visit with the homeless two Saturdays per month.\n\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society – Coordinates the JFK Advent Food Drive and Lenten Rice Bowl collection, sponsors projects for the needy with other Catholic high schools, and supports the adopted Mission Church of La Guardia, Bolivia.\n\nHuman Relations Coordinators – Representatives from each class plan assemblies and programs to further understanding among the various cultures present at JFK. Senior leaders work with the Campus Ministry Office in conflict resolution when necessary.\n\nRelay For Life – Established in the Fall of 2004, the Relay For Life team at Kennedy engages in the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life in the spring of each school year. Typically participating at the Green Lake Relay For Life in Seattle, the team raises money for cancer research throughout the year, selling shirts, baked goods, and car washes. They then present the money to the society at the Relay, an overnight event that occurs annually. The team is typically led by upperclassmen and involves 20–40 members each year.\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nKennedy Catholic is part of the Cascade Division of the North Puget Sound League within the WIAA's District 3 (West Central) [2] and has won 14 State Titles and over 145 League Titles. The Kennedy Lancers has produced some NCAA Division I Prospects in the last few years including Michelle French, Nate Williams, Everrette Thompson, Paul Arnold and Cole Madison.\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 13, 2020, two teachers were allegedly forced to resign after becoming engaged to same-sex partners, allegedly contradicting covenant agreements between the individuals and the school. While the religiously-affiliated school is exempt from Washington state workplace discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, students and community members argued that firing LGBT teachers contradicts the teachings of the Catholic Church.[3][4] In response, students, parents, alumni, and members of the larger Catholic community have protested in support of the two teachers.[5]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nFloyd Bannister (1973) – Major League Baseball player\n\nLizanne Falsetto (1981) – business entrepreneur, wellness expert, model, and public speaker\n\nMike Utley (1984) – former National Football League player\n\nJim Caviezel (1987) – film actor\n\nJ.
