        "text": "In 1962, efforts began to open a co-educational Catholic High School in south Seattle. While in Rome in 1963, the Archbishop of Seattle learned of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and announced that the yet to be built school would be named in his memory. In 1965, ground is broken to begin construction of John F. Kennedy Memorial High School. Monsignor John Doogan is appointed to be the school’s first principal. Future principals of the school included John Dempsey, John Goodwin and John C. (Jack) Schuster.\n\nThe first class of freshman students enrolled in the fall of 1966 and classes were conducted in portables at St. Thomas in Riverton Heights due to school construction. The 181 students from St. Thomas moved their classrooms in the spring to the partially completed school and began classes on the first floor of B-wing.\n\nOn May 25, 1968, the school grounds were blessed and dedicated and the cornerstone was laid. The design of the school is U-shape with the chapel located at the center of the “U” to represent the church as the central figure of the school, both literally and figuratively.\n\nThe school has changed in many ways since its inception. Over the years, the curriculum has expanded to include the addition of innovative and challenging electives and advanced courses, with numerous AP and college credit offerings. Today, students benefit from the addition of advanced technology and state-of-the-art science labs. Over the years, additions to the academic program included the formation of the Aquinas Honors Program, the International Program and more recently, the Blessed Mother Teresa Program.\n\nParent volunteer groups played an active role in the school. Parent Club, BSHARP and the Booster Club all support the development of successful school programs including outstanding athletics and award-winning performing and fine arts.\n\nStudent traditions continue to be enriched by years of memories and new traditions have been added."
