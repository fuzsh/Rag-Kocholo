        "text": "Why did your family choose Kennedy for your education?\n\nCatholic education was important to my family. I attended St. Stephen School in Niles, and when it was time for my older brother to move on to high school, my family chose Kennedy and it was a perfect fit for both of us.\n\nWhat is your favorite Kennedy memory?\n\nLong nights as a 24-hour walker during Relay for Life, volunteering through the ministry department with Mrs. Dixon, service trips to Ecuador and Nicaragua, and competing with the girls soccer team are among some of my favorite memories from my time at Kennedy. And of course, the near daily trips to the cafeteria for fresh baked cookies.\n\nDid you have a teacher or class that was a major influence on you?\n\nMr. Boyle’s senior religion class had a major impact on my worldview and helped shift my perception of religion and spirituality. My time spent in Mrs. Rupinsky’s AP calculus class (when math was not my forte) showed me what patience can look like, as she and my fellow classmates so graciously re-explained concepts to me over and over again. My time spent in Latin class with Mrs. BenDaali helped me to develop perseverance, because there’s nothing like toiling over translations to— in her words— put some hair on your chest!\n\nEducation/Professional Experience:\n\nWhat career did you choose and tell us a little bit about how you got there.\n\nI graduated from Miami University in 2019 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Public Health. After completing an internship with a non-profit in Cincinnati my sophomore year, it became clear to me sitting at a desk in an office was not the right fit for me. The summer following my junior year, I took a seasonal position as a teen programming director at a summer camp in the mountains of central Washington state. This decision, although I worried would set me behind my peers pursuing seemingly more productive or professional ventures, completely changed my personal and professional trajectory. I fell in love with leading backpacking trips, learning about backcountry medicine, and teaching wilderness first aid. I challenged myself and got out of my comfort zone. I met people from all around the world and made some of my dearest lifelong friends. I returned to this position for a second summer season after graduating from Miami, moved to Washington and took a position running an after-school program for a local elementary school in the fall.\n\nLike many folks experienced, my world was shaken up in March of 2020. The after-school program became obsolete when everything went virtual, and I went on to find work as a preschool teacher, a nanny, and at an archery range. On a whim, I applied to nursing school. It had been in the back of my mind, having always been interested in healthcare (Although I squeamishly opted-out of dissection day in biology during my time at Kennedy, I absolutely loved my semester of explorative dissection in a college anatomy course). My biggest role model— my dad— is a nurse. His parents met working as nurses in World War II. When a little voice in the back of my head told me it might just be a good fit, I reluctantly listened. And I’m glad I did. I completed an accelerated Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing program at Ursuline College and now work as a Hematology/Oncology (cancer) nurse on a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant floor in Cleveland. I learn so much every shift I work, and get to build relationships with my patients as they are on our floor getting treatment for weeks or months at a time. I look forward to exploring a variety of nursing specialties, and plan to continue pursuing opportunities for travel and seasonal work in the outdoor sector!\n\nWhat accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\nNot being intimidated by “starting over.” In this phase of life, it is easy to feel like you have to pick a track and stay on it in order to find success. I am glad that I pursued a variety of interests and jobs, took risks, and didn’t commit to an area of study or work that didn’t feel right. I’m happy I learned when I did that your path doesn’t have to look like anyone else’s, and you don’t have to limit yourself to one narrow path when it comes to a career. That mindset led me to beautiful places and fulfilling roles where I have been able to positively impact individuals and communities that I hold close to my heart."
