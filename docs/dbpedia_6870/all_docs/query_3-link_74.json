        "text": "“Are there footsteps?” this reviewer’s academic advisor, the esteemed Dorothy M. Brown, wondered about the originality of his John F. Kennedy-related dissertation topic. Almost three decades later, on the fiftieth anniversary of Kennedy’s assassination, there were about 40,000 books addressing some aspect of the nation’s thirty-fifth president. That’s a lot of footsteps.\n\nFortunately, those numbers would not deter Patrick Lacroix, whose 2017 dissertation has become a 2021 book, John F. Kennedy and the Politics of Faith. Before assessing the impact of Kennedy’s religion on his presidency, Lacroix confronts those who depict Kennedy as a nominal Catholic in a secular age. He concludes that Kennedy was more religious, and his religion was more consequential, than these critics believe.\n\nLacroix persuasively presents a politically astute President Kennedy who spent much of his maiden year in office dispelling non-Catholics’ qualms about his faith. Kennedy first adopted rigid positions [End Page 87] against funding of church schools in his unsuccessful education legislation and against grants to religious organizations in his successful Peace Corps initiative. He then felt free to compromise on education and the Peace Corps, doggedly pursue his Alliance for Progress in mostly Catholic yet heavily authoritarian Latin America, quietly welcome Pope John XXIII’s diplomatic involvement during and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, boldly conduct an ecumenical civil rights campaign, and loudly proclaim at Boston College his allegiance to the papal encyclical Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth).\n\nTo the author, Kennedy was a significant, if somewhat cautious and calculating, representative of his church. The two Johns—the pope and the president—inspired liberal reform of the Catholic Church and American society, while provoking a Protestant and Catholic conservative backlash to both. By defusing and inflaming the nation’s religious tensions, the Kennedy era foreshadowed the political challenges of the contemporary United States.\n\nTo the author’s credit, this slender volume, with fewer than two hundred pages of text, is an easy read. But in some ways it is too easy. Lacroix exhaustively mined documents from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and explored many important primary and secondary works. He nonetheless missed some of the recent literature on President Kennedy’s engagement with his church on matters of civil rights, contraception, and foreign policy, while virtually overlooking Catholic and Protestant archival documents.\n\nAs a result, the author makes a few weakly substantiated or contradictory claims. He quotes one of Kennedy’s diplomats as saying that the president’s religion “meant an awful lot to Latin Americans” without citing any Latin Americans (86). He asserts that Catholics and Protestants alike applauded Kennedy’s Boston College address, without citing any Catholic sources and only one Protestant source.\n\nLacroix lauds Kennedy’s commitment to the “institutional” (179) separation of church and state, even though the president’s initial opposition to federal aid to nonpublic schools “owed more to political than constitutional considerations” (46). He posits that the “decisive support” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump by [End Page 88] “evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics” in 2016 was partly due to vestiges of the “visible and powerful . . . conservative religious reaction” to President Kennedy, even though Kennedy’s education, Peace Corps, and foreign policy efforts had heartened many evangelical Protestants (183–184). Polling would reveal that Catholic support for Kennedy grew during his administration. And while more Catholic voters chose Trump than picked his opponent in 2016, more Catholics had selected liberal Democrats Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Jimmy Carter (once), Bill Clinton (twice), Al Gore, and Barack Obama (twice) than had opted for their rivals.\n\nThis is a good book, a valuable addition to the historiography on John F. Kennedy’s faith and presidency. It would complement other studies of the intersection between religion, politics, and the presidents in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. But it could have been even better—if only the author had heard more footsteps."
