        "text": "\"Lacroix has provided us with much food for thought and has offered resources and outlines for further research by scholars and consideration by interested readers.\"—Journal of Church and State\n\n\"Patrick Lacroix offers a number of important new insights into a figure and era that religious and political historians had thought had been picked clean. They were mistaken.\"—Catholic Historical Review\n\n“John F. Kennedy’s Catholicism has often been seen as merely a surmountable barrier to election. In fact, as Patrick Lacroix capably demonstrates, Kennedy’s religious engagement supplies a missing piece to histories of American Catholicism and to dominant narratives about the decline of the religious left and rise of the religious right. Through deft use of sources, including a treasure trove of oral histories, Lacroix reveals Kennedy as a catalyst for midcentury religious realignment and a figure who demands reconsideration.”—Elesha Coffman, author of The Christian Century and the Rise of the Protestant Mainline\n\n“As Patrick Lacroix explains with skill and grace, the ‘Catholic question’ in American politics was not put to rest with the presidential election of 1960. In John F. Kennedy and the Politics of Faith, we learn how Kennedy’s engagement with religion on a broad range of subjects produced surprising alliances, unlikely foes, and unexpected results, all of which shaped his presidency and the political culture of the United States going forward. Lacroix has made an important contribution to our understanding of the Kennedy legacy and of the 1960s.”—Jason K. Duncan, author of John F. Kennedy: The Spirit of Cold War Liberalism\n\n“Saying something new about John F. Kennedy and Catholicism might seem impossible, but Patrick Lacroix accomplishes this and much more. His astute and compelling study traces how Kennedy’s Catholicism shaped domestic and foreign policy choices on everything from education to Latin America. To read Lacroix is to understand how religion shaped not only the Kennedy presidency but also much of what followed during the not-so-secular 1960s.”—John McGreevy, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame, and author of Catholicism and American Freedom: A History"
