        "text": "HYANNIS — The Rev. Michael Fitzpatrick on Monday told parishioners at St. Francis Xavier Church that he had prayed to John F. Kennedy, asking that the day's commemorative Mass in his honor to run smoothly.\n\nThe Kennedy family, including the president, his siblings, and generations of Kennedys that followed, worshiped at the South Street church and Our Lady of Victory Church in Centerville.\n\nOn Monday — 100 years to the day since the late president’s birth — Fitzpatrick and the Rev. Mark Hession spoke of Kennedy’s devotion to justice, the nation and his faith. Leading up to and during his abbreviated presidency, the church was a place where Kennedy was both a larger than life celebrity and simply another parishioner, one of several aspects of the man's complicated relationship with his faith.\n\nAbout 70 people attended the Mass on Memorial Day, several of them donning American flags or wearing photographs of JFK on their clothing.\n\n“He lived and wanted to be a neighbor,” said John Allen, executive director of the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum, who attended the Mass with his wife, Maureen. “These were his neighbors coming to see him.”\n\nFaith in his own way\n\nYears before John Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected the 35th president of the United States, the first Catholic ever to occupy the Oval Office, he would snap on his roller skates, glide down the tree-lined streets of Brookline to his family’s church and quickly say a few prayers before continuing on with his day.\n\n“From what I understand about Jack as a young boy, he approached religion in his own way,” said James R. Roberts, a supervisory park ranger at the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site. “Their mother once took them all to church and asked them all to pray for a happy death. He later reported at the dinner table that he prayed for two puppies.”\n\nDespite being raised in a pious Irish Catholic home, regularly attending church and reciting prayers, historians remain skeptical of how big a role religion played in the president’s personal life.\n\n“That is the question. I’m still sort of on the fence even after studying Kennedy for several years,” said Patrick Lacroix, who recently completed his dissertation on JFK and religion. “He never wrote about it and in fact he never really discussed it with his closest adviser.”\n\nReligion in the Oval Office\n\nReligion became a contentious issue during the 1960 presidential election, with many concerned that, if elected, Kennedy would be the pope’s mouthpiece.\n\nTo address those concerns, Kennedy gave a speech Sept. 12, 1960 to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association.\n\n- Video from Monday's special commemorative Mass\n\n“I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference; and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him,” he told the crowd.\n\nAfter the speech, and the distribution of the text to clergy across the nation, the religious issue never again demanded the candidate’s or the nation’s full attention in connection with his run for office, but it never truly went away.\n\nLacroix, a historian of religion and immigration, and a former instructor at the University of New Hampshire, chronicled the anti-Catholicism Kennedy faced during his campaign and while in office, focusing on his outreach to Protestants, Jews and Catholics to form the “religious left.”\n\n“He was able to diminish anti-Catholicism while he was in office,” Lacroix said.\n\nBut some of his policies drew condemnation from leaders of his own faith, Lacroix and Roberts said.\n\nFrancis Joseph Spellman, a cardinal in New York City, had ended a long-standing relationship with the Kennedy family and supported Richard Nixon in the 1960 campaign after JFK announced he was against using federal funding to support parochial schools.\n\nToday, however, John F. Kennedy remains an idol among many Irish Catholic families in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nReligion at home\n\nKennedy’s mother, Rose Kennedy, the daughter of Boston Mayor John Francis “Honey Fitz” Fitzgerald, was the sixth American woman to be granted the title of Countess by the Vatican.\n\nThroughout her life, she was a devout Catholic, having studied at a convent school, and regularly attended Mass, eventually bringing her children to St. Aidan’s Church in Brookline every day.\n\nThe future president, like six of his younger siblings, was baptized at St. Aidan’s, which was built only a few years before the family bought the Brookline home.\n\nAlthough he served as an altar boy at the church with his brothers, it was JFK's younger brother, Robert Kennedy, who was nicknamed for the duty and was favored by his mother, Roberts said.\n\n- Photo gallery: St. Francis Xavier Church and the Kennedy family\n\nWhen Robert Kennedy died, Rose said she knew what the Virgin Mary felt like when Jesus died, Roberts said.\n\n“I do think he may have been not nearly as devout as his brothers Joe Jr. and Bobby,” Roberts said of JFK.\n\nWhile serving in World War II, he continued to observe rituals, but like many men witnessing the atrocities of war, he questioned his faith in letters home, according to Roberts.\n\nHe never stopped actively participating in his faith, but decades after his death, his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, said her late husband went through the rituals so quickly that she questioned if they had any meaning to him, according to Lacroix.\n\n“One thing's for sure: He was not nearly as influenced by his Catholic teachings in his politics as his brother Bobby,” Lacroix said.\n\nHyannisport\n\nIn 1928, Joseph and Rose Kennedy purchased their sprawling Hyannisport home and became summer parishioners at nearby St. Francis Xavier Church.\n\nThe church became a focus of media and the public seeking to capture images of the iconic young president and his family, with many waiting outside to shake his hand. But the family's faith, already tested by the death of JFK's older brother, Joseph, would be tried again and again with the deaths of JFK, Robert Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr. and other family members throughout the years.\n\nIn 1963, Monsignor Thomas Harrington was a young seminarian at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., when he was awoken and summoned to the White House to preside over the president's casket.\n\nHarrington, 78 and retired, recalled the wails of the women who gathered in the room to pray over Kennedy’s body.\n\n“He was the first president I could vote for,” Harrington said. “I voted for him.”\n\nAfter becoming ordained, Harrington was assigned to St. Francis Xavier and got a chance to continue his relationship with the Kennedy family.\n\nRose, he said, would attend daily, and sit among other parishioners.\n\n“Mrs. Kennedy came every morning. She was a very pious woman,” Harrington said. “Just one little old lady among others.”\n\nThe younger Kennedys, like Jacqueline and Ethel, would make arrangements to come to the church at night with their children, say prayers, and slip away.\n\nOn Sundays, however, the Hyannis Fire Department, for which Harrington served as the chaplain, would rope off a portion of the church parking lot where the Kennedys would park their cars so they wouldn’t be bothered by the crowds that gathered outside.\n\nHarrington would even make trips to the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport after Rose’s husband Joseph Kennedy had a stroke in December of 1961 and couldn’t make it to church on Sundays.\n\n“Bobby would serve (as an altar boy) sometimes with his son if nobody showed up,” Harrington said. “Occasionally, I would bring Holy Communion to the ambassador (Joseph P. Kennedy) at the compound.”\n\nA new generation\n\nIn his inaugural address, JFK spoke of a torch being passed to a new generation of Americans unwilling to witness the undoing of human rights.\n\nThe late president's grandchildren and their many cousins, as well as young people around the world, are now that new generation, Hession said during Monday’s Mass.\n\n“The president devoted his life to the work of justice, to what the late Jesuit Walter Burghardt so aptly described as ‘making things right,’” Hession said. “Lord help this new generation to help us all make things right.”\n\n— Follow Haven Orecchio-Egresitz on Twitter: @HavenCCT"
