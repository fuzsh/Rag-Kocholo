        "text": "1. Considering where you thought we'd be by 2002, how do you evaluate current technological progress?\n\nIn space exploration I have seen the retreat from any human presence beyond low earth orbit very dissapointing. I don't know enough about nanotechnology to judge how the realization has compared with the potentual in that field.\n\n2. Any surprises, in terms of developments arriving sooner than expected, or totally unexpected findings?\n\nThe biggest surprise is how one cannot count on continued progress in science and technology, and the relative stagnation in the appearence of things like new aircraft prototypes as compared with 50 years ago.\n\n3. In your opinion, who are the top 5 major players advancing the state of the art? And the 5 major areas where advances are being made.\n\nI can only name two people, Hans Morovec and Eric Drexler\n\n4. Besides getting themselves informed about MNT, what proactive steps can the general public take to help us steer clear of the potentially dangerous possibilities [such as the Gray Goo or \"runaway\" scenario]?\n\nIf there is a significent risk associated with such developments some method must be found to isolate the possible damage of a runaway scenario similar to the precautions taken in biologically hazardous work. Isolation of a facility in a space station at a libration point might be called for in extreme cases, such as could concievably be required to protect our biosystem from Martian life in returned samples.\n\n6. Based upon where we are now, do you anticipate any dramatic breakthroughs in the near future? In 5 years. In 10. In 25.\n\nWho knows? I still keep waiting for fusion power, perpetually dangled before us as 20 years away...\n\n7. With the advent of mature MNT, where do you see the most drastic changes occurring?\n\nWarfare, as a kind of mechanical plague against people and machines. If it is possible to produce clinically reliable treatments for various medical conditions so much the better, but it is easier to destroy than to build. War always benefits first and most from technological advances.\n\nHow can society and industry prepare for it?\n\nwho knows?\n\n8. What event has caused you the greatest concern?\n\nThe use of technology to snoop on people and ferret out those practising forbidden beliefs and lifestyles in order to persecute them.\n\nand the greatest hope?\n\nElectronic communications providing the means for people to network and obtain news independently of the corporate ruled media outlets.\n\nor is the most contentious?\n\nThe drowning out of real information amid the babble of fringe conspiracy tales and belief inspired agendas."
