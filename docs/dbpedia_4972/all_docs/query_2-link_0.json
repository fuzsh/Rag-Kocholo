        "text": "Congressman Don Davis was born and raised in Snow Hill, North Carolina. He has spent his life answering the call to serve -- as a veteran, educator, minister, and dedicated public servant.\n\nAs a young man, Congressman Davis worked in the tobacco fields and faithfully attended the same church where he currently ministers. He graduated in 1994 from the United States Air Force Academy and became a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force, where he actively served in uniform for eight years. As a First Lieutenant, Davis coordinated Air Force One and CODEL operations at Andrews Air Force Base and supported families of military members as a mortuary officer.\n\nCongressman Davis returned to eastern North Carolina as an assistant professor of Aerospace Studies at East Carolina University Air Force ROTC Detachment 600, where he taught national security affairs, military history, and leadership courses. As an educator for over 20 years, Davis mentored thousands of students as they completed their studies."
