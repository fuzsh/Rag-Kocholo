        "text": "PRINTER FRIENDLY VIEW\n\n(inverts site colors)\n\nBuy it... on the 2008 limited album if you desire a most balanced and palatable presentation of Don Davis' often difficult, postmodern score, the 1999 album too short and the 2021 complete version only for true franchise enthusiasts.\n\nAvoid it... if you demand the greater role of thematic tonality that develops in the two sequel scores by Davis, both featuring a more interesting blend of challenging dissonance and quasi-religious drama.\n\nEDITORIAL REVIEW\n\nFILMTRACKS TRAFFIC RANK: #22 WRITTEN 6/17/99, REVISED 7/25/21\n\nDavis\n\nThe Matrix: (Don Davis) Very rarely does a truly visionary concept come out of Hollywood, especially in the science fiction and fantasy genres that include thousands of entries over many decades. The existential issues raised by Andy and Larry Wachowski in 1999's The Matrix proposed the idea that everything man knows in terms of \"reality\" is a computer simulation controlled by machines in a real world of the future, a world in which humans' bodies are harvested for energy while their brains are fed the illusion of a world contemporary to viewing audiences. Those who have escaped the machines and their endless levels of competing programming hide deep under the surface of the planet, plugging into the virtual world when necessary to cause trouble and save people who didn't know they needed salvation. The primary target for both humans and machines is the character of Neo (Keanu Reeves), who is the Jesus Christ figure of this disjointed world and the one who can both save humanity and bring balance to the machine world. The film's March release revealed relatively low initial expectations from Warner Brothers, though an explosive return at the box office eventually opened the door for two successful sequels, both released (awkwardly) in 2003. The production elements of The Matrix are stunning, especially in the art direction and Wachowskis' unique techniques of shooting and editing fight sequences, the latter revolutionary at the time. The dimensions of time and space are distorted in the film's pivotal moments, yielding a marvelous spectacle of sight to coincide with the story's already unconventional propositions. The Wachowskis realized immediately that the film would require an unusual combination of music, especially when pertaining to the score. While the trilogy adopted more of a romantic sense of fantasy in its sequels, The Matrix presented an odd blend of horror and coolness in between its frantic chase sequences. The real-world veterans played by Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne exuded professional and cool personas that necessitated an equally ass-kicking personality in the music, and for these concepts, the Wachowskis relied on hard rock songs. This is especially evident as Neo adopts the same persona in the last flying sequence of the film.\n\nWith the hip, mainstream elements of The Matrix addressed by Marilyn Manson and others, the Wachowskis turned to their collaborator for the quirky Bound, Don Davis, to provide the unusual sounds necessary for the darker concepts. The directors specifically requested music that was different, and whether you label it postmodern or avant-garde, Don Davis' result certainly succeeds. It was a project that Davis referred to as a dream assignment, for it allowed him, as he stated, to rely more heavily on the \"postmodern works that are being done now on the concert stage.\" Davis has always enjoyed writing original concert pieces in his career, because it allows for a level of freedom and exploration that films don't often permit. He commented that The Matrix, despite being a good candidate for a different sound, would not have worked with a score heavily laden with synthesizers, and he justified this by claiming that electronic scores had become something of the norm by the late 1990's. Instead, when Davis arrived at a particular scene in the film, he tackled it by writing music in exactly the opposite mould of what initial reactions might dictate. Perhaps this is most evident in the cue \"The Power Plant,\" in which Davis arrives at the score's most monumental crescendo of harmonic resonance for full ensemble and (ironically Mormon) choir, albeit briefly, for the moment when the lead character discovers the horrors of the real world for the first time. Another example exists in the cue \"Welcome to the Real World,\" which is treated to a melancholy boy soprano solo despite the fact that that same man, Neo, is now surrounded by a group of real and genuinely caring people for the first time. Davis' work for the film is better recognized, however, for its harsh dissonance and startling brass tones in atonal bursts of energy that are indeed quite harrowing to hear. Even when the score isn't as truly unlistenable as the terrifying mangle of sound in \"Unable to Speak,\" Davis inserts unease into every cue. As a horror experience, The Matrix is one of the more engaging on album, though this statement remains interesting in that such material really doesn't define the music as heard in the film. For this score, there is significant difference between the two.\n\nWhile Davis has claimed that he looked back at no orchestral film score as his guide for The Matrix, there are actually distinct similarities between this work and that which resulted from the Alien sequels by James Horner and Elliot Goldenthal. Fans of the latter composer, specifically, will note that Davis' handling of layers of instrumentation in order to produce disharmony, highly organized despite being unpleasant, is remarkably reminiscent to Goldenthal's avant-garde tendencies. The unusually large and diverse role for the brass section is mostly responsible for this style in The Matrix, along with ominous rumbling of the piano and other percussion. Some of these instruments are electronically manipulated to give them a foreign sound. There are no simple themes in The Matrix despite the franchise's movement towards the romantic in the sequels. The superhero element for Neo does shine through in \"Anything is Possible,\" with the major-key statement on brass over choir in the cue providing an obvious hint of both his powers and his savior status. (This proves to be a theme in and of itself in the sequels.) Late in that cue, at 4:50 (as well as late in \"Ontological Shock\"), audiences hear the opening bars of the love theme for Neo and Trinity that would later flourish and resolve by \"Trinity Definitely\" in The Matrix Revolutions. The finale cue ends with a raucous crescendo that could easily fit in Alien 3, Heat, or Sphere. The two most distinct ideas in The Matrix are also staples of the series. First, the pulsating, pitch-defying brass polychord effect that wavers between trumpets on top and horns below is an extremely distinctive identity for the entire franchise. It's instantly recognizable and proves quite useful in the ease with which it can be integrated into nearly any cue. Davis' method of presenting the polychord motif at the very start of the film, with rolling piano and tingling metallic percussion, smartly carried over to the sequels. Secondly, the evil machines are given a rhythmic effect of a deliberate, accelerating movement, both tapped out lightly on the cymbals several times (a definite Horner influence) or blasted by brass in the aforementioned moment of choral tonality in \"The Power Plant.\" The sense of the inevitable in this motif cannot be missed. Also omnipresent are metallic sound effects through all of these ideas, sometimes making you wonder if one of your major household appliances is malfunctioning.\n\nOverall, The Matrix is extremely original, but it's not easy listening on album. The songs play such a prominent role in the film that there is often confusion for mainstream viewers about where the boundary between the songs and score exists. Perhaps the most obvious blurring of lines comes with the use of Rob Dougan's undoubtedly cool, rhythmically ascending \"Clubbed to Death\" piece for the scene when Neo is reintroduced to the matrix (and the lady in the red dress). So distinct was the adaptation of that piece into The Matrix that Dougan would himself expand the idea for The Matrix Reloaded. It's not surprising that most of the hype generated by the music of The Matrix came from the non-Davis material, which consists of songs that people often associate with the film when protesting and extending their belief that it inspires school shootings. The most interesting debate about music usage for the film ironically involved the use of \"The Eyes of Truth\" by Enigma, with a gothic new age style of heavy percussion and massive chorus that very obviously stirred anticipation in the film's trailers. The lack of an Enigma-like sound in the actual score was understandable when you look at the project from Davis' postmodern viewpoint, but it's interesting to observe that his two sequel scores slowly moved towards exactly that kind of sound. It's unlikely that this choice was made based on so much positive hype from the usage, but those listeners unsatisfied with the lack of that kind of score eventually heard something more to their liking. The Varèse Sarabande release of the score at the time of the film's debut only included 30 minutes of material, omitting a significant portion of the film's middle \"explanation scenes\" and final action music, upwards of ten minutes in the case of the latter alone. Among all of Varèse's 30-minute albums of the middle to late 1990's, which were short due to financial, re-use reasons and not by the choice of the label, The Matrix was among those that truly bothered film music collectors the most. But you can't fault Varèse in this case, taking into account the fact that the recording included a 90-piece Los Angeles (in other words: union) ensemble. To their credit, they assembled 30 minutes of material that included a competent selection to represent the various parts of Davis' work, including most of the prevalent tonal passages of fantasy appeal. For some casual listeners, this presentation may even suffice.\n\nThe problems posed by the Varèse album were solved for some film score collectors when the region 1 DVD was released with an isolated score track, and within a couple of years, 2-CD bootlegs of the music flooded the market. Surprising most in the community, Varèse chose to add The Matrix to its selection of \"Deluxe Edition\" entries within its series of limited Club titles in 2008, expanding the running time of the presentation to a whopping 78 minutes. Considering the relatively large pressing of 3,000 copies and the fact that many fans had already satisfied themselves with the DVD rip of the music, it should be no surprise that the album did not come close to selling out as quickly as some had anticipated, and copies remained on sale for less than $20 in 2009. As for the contents of the 2008 expanded product, nearly every major cue from the score is compiled into a well-rounded, if not perhaps overextended review of the score. Davis' material is obviously interesting enough in each of its minutes to retain attention from an intellectual standpoint, but there is some redundancy in the added music. Finally heard on a legitimate release is the plethora of rhythmic slapping, tingling, and wavering that accompanies Morpheus' crew as they maneuver or snap to action (\"Switch Out\" and \"Whoa, Switch Brokers\"). A better sense of propulsion is conveyed on this product, with rhythmic urgency translating to even the cues of minimalistic volume. Among the most important additions to the original album's material is the traumatic \"Nascent Nauseous Neo,\" the Japanese-flavored \"Domo Showdown,\" the rhythmically dense, synthetically manipulated \"Switch Out,\" and the pair of lengthy climax cues, \"That's Gotta Hurt\" and \"Surprise.\" Enthusiasts of the sequel scores are treated to another hint of the Neo and Trinity love theme in the middle of \"Switch Out.\" Still, if you tally all of these important additional cues, you end up with an optimized album running at far less than an hour in length, which would perhaps be the most comfortable compromise for an already difficult (and for some people, nearly intolerable) listening experience. The 2008 album did eventually sell out, as the film's cult status demanded more supply, and Varèse finally followed up in 2021 with a \"Complete Edition\" that boosted the presentation to 2 CDs with an overall running time just over 99 minutes and offers a plethora of brief new cues that often represent crescendos for a stinger moment.\n\nThe 2021 album for The Matrix will become tiresome for all but the film and score's most ardent enthusiasts, as most of the added material is at least somewhat redundant. More than a few cues, like \"Trinity Infinity,\" \"Nascent Nauseous Neo,\" and \"Ontological Shock,\" are presented in their longer variations with ambient opening or closing parts. The completely new cues are less vital in the first half of the score but illuminate important narrative movement in the latter half. Suspenseful crescendos await in \"Neo Con Brio\" and \"Switch Works Her Boa,\" while \"Follow the White Rabbit\" is a very brief extension of \"Neo Con Brio\" and the duo of \"Bring Me Dinner\" and \"The System\" explore slight and increasingly atonal ambience. Of more interest is the decent horror of \"Through the Surveillance Monitor,\" the tonal moment of gravity in \"Cypher Cybernetic,\" the source-like harp of \"Ignorance is Bliss/Cyber Cyphernetic,\" a brief optimistic swirl in \"See Who?,\" and meaty material added to \"Exit Mr. Hat.\" Later new inclusions are particularly vital to the narrative flow of the score and are most welcome, including the varied, important \"The Cure\" and the impressive pair of \"It's the Smell\" and \"The Lobby,\" both of which offer a notable industrial rhythm with good presence across soundscape, the latter with more aggressive percussion. Albeit short, \"Fast Learning\" is another important narrative cue with optimistic anticipation. Listeners hoping for additional performances of either the polychord motif of octave-defying alternations or the nascent love theme will be disappointed in that the newly revealed cues don't offer a greater role for those identities. Like the 2008 album, the 2021 offering will be too long for most casual listeners, but if a superior 40-minute arrangement of the score were to be edited for that audience, a few of the 2021 album-specific cues could make the cut. For audiophiles, Varèse released not only 2,000 copies of regular CD sets but another 1,000 copies of hybrid SA-CDs at a higher cost that are capable of providing the regular stereo experience on ordinary CD players and can also supply a 5.1 surround alternative via SA-CD and Blu-ray players. Like other recent Club products, the label offered high and low-resolution digital versions, too, and the insane, continued interest in LPs yielded a 3-LP version of the album as well. Generally, Warner Bothers handled the commercial album situation a bit better with the sequels, addressing the finer balance between score and songs, especially in The Matrix Reloaded. On the whole, while The Matrix is a fine and original score for its film, it's by far the least enjoyable of the three original entries on any of its albums. @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nMusic as Written for the Film: ****\n\nMusic as Heard on the 1999 Album: **\n\nMusic as Heard on the 2008 and 2021 Albums: ***\n\nOverall: ***\n\nBias Check: For Don Davis reviews at Filmtracks, the average editorial rating is 3.2 (in 10 reviews)\n\nand the average viewer rating is 3.06 (in 44,192 votes).

The insert for that product, however, offers no extra information about the film or score. The 2008 Varèse Club album contains lengthy notation about both the film and score, though it concentrates heavily on Davis' career rather than the construction of the music. The packaging creatively uses a green spine accent rather than the maroon usually seen on Varèse's products, an obvious nod to the color of the code in the film.\n\nThe insert of the 2021 album contains extensive information about the film and score. Varèse released the following information about the SACD product:\n\n\"The Complete Edition 2-5.1 SA-CD Matrix soundtrack comes on two Hybrid SA-CDs (Super Audio CDs). These Hybrid SA-CD's contain a CD layer that can be played on any CD player, and a hi-resolution SA-CD layer that contains DSD audio in stereo and surround versions. The audio on the SA-CD layer has been upsampled from 48 thousand samples per second 24bit PCM audio to 2.8 million samples per second 1 bit DSD audio. When these disks are inserted into an SA-CD player or a Blu-Ray player that can play SA-CD's, you will hear up-converted hi-resolution DSD audio in stereo or surround and realize the sonic enhancement that comes from the up-conversion.\""
