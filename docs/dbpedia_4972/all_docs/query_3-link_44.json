        "text": "Miles Davis was one of the few musicians who could adapt to any music trend. He wasn’t an Orthodox composer. He was a stubborn \"protestant” composer.\n\nI’ve been an avid jazz listener since my teenage years. My dad, a core lover of Afrobeat, used to play Fela’s recording on his old stereo player almost every morning.\n\nMy love for Afrobeat made jazz sound familiar to me on first listening. I can remember the first jazz music I listened to, “So What” by Miles Davis. Blasting two notes on the horns on top of detached jazz piano chord changes was soothing to my ear.\n\nI quickly came to realize that Miles Davis was the soul of Jazz. He was the heartbeat of the culture. From the outside, it seems as though Miles originated jazz. But he had predecessors; Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Louis Armstrong all came before him. But Miles stood out and was able to stay relevant for decades.\n\nEveryone else, even people like John Coltrane and Duke Ellington all belong to a certain era, a certain genre of jazz, and as wonderful as they are, they’ll always be known for that. But Miles is jazz. He represents the totality of jazz. And when he came back, he was still able to go into something else. — Milan Simich\n\nBut what made Miles stand out? How come someone who came years later became a figure for the jazz movement? How come so many great jazz musicians had to pass through him? What made him write over forty albums of his own? What made him evolve and never phase out for decades?\n\nI studied Miles and discovered one main thing: Miles loved music.\n\nThe only thing I’m interested in is the music and the musicians. I don’t acknowledge applause ’cause I’m giving them something. They’re not giving me anything with their applause. Can I write that down? — Miles Davis\n\nThe Beginning\n\nUnlike many stories of rags to riches, Miles’ was never impoverished. His was the story of a man who knew what he wanted and went for it, not a Hollywood tale of a youngster from the slums who discovered Jazz as a route out.\n\nMiles was raised in a pleasant, middle-class environment. Both his father and grandfather had been prosperous dentists and landowners. Cleota Henry Davis, his mother, was highly esteemed in the neighborhood. A maid was living there, and eventually, Miles’ father would purchase a 300-acre farm with pigs, cows, and horses. Therefore, he wasn’t impoverished.\n\nWhen I studied Miles, it was as if he was born to perform music. I couldn’t find any motivation for why he chose music, such as poverty or a lack of material possessions. Miles Davis became interested in music and spent hours listening to the radio.\n\nIt’s said that history began when he received his first trumpet at the age of nine.\n\nMiles’ Intentionality\n\nMiles' intentionality, in my opinion, lies halfway between subtle toxicity and a fervent attention to detail.\n\nFirstly, Miles was quite intentional about the kind of music he wanted to make, even though later in life, he began experimenting with many genres and electronic music.\n\nHe wanted to do jazz, and he wanted to do it well.\n\nSoon, I discovered Miles never really loved jazz; he just loved freedom. He was into jazz because it gave him freedom.\n\nIf traditional classical music in a school had allowed him the flexibility he desired, he would not have left Juilliard after a short stay.\n\nHis burning love for freedom can be found in one of his sayings:\n\nDo not fear mistakes. There are none.\n\nSecondly, even though his father was the one who sent him to Juilliard in New York, Miles' intentionality was evident in his decision to move to New York and pursue Charlie Parker.\n\nAccording to Branford Marsalis, Miles’ search for Parker reveals much about his approach to jazz and music.\n\nWhen you talked to Miles about jazz — and he said it in his book — he would say that he came to New York to play with Charlie Parker. Now that’s a very interesting statement to make, because Charlie Parker was one of the great geniuses of jazz. But so was Duke Ellington, so was Billie Holiday, so was Louis Armstrong, so was Coleman Hawkins and they were all there. But Bird was like the enfant terrible, the bad boy of the scene. He showed up late in crumpled suits and he was the one black guy who stood up to the system of social oppression. And Miles wanted to be around him, the controversial, bad boy of jazz. He wanted to be on the cutting edge of the hip shit and Bird was the hippest shit there was. Now the amazing thing about Miles was that if he had to become a seriously bad-ass trumpet player to do that, he was willing to do that. But the original reason to do that had nothing to do with his profound love of jazz, but more to be on the scene with the baddest dude.\n\nAfter they met, the two collaborated on numerous records. I think Miles took both good and negative lessons from him; it was reported that he picked up some of his toxic behaviors and how to handle his band later on. Charlie Parker often left his bandmates on stage to smoke and spoke to them abruptly.\n\nLastly, Miles' intentionality can be found in how he wanted his music to sound and who he chose to be his band member. Miles might be “technically limited” as opposed to Dizzy Gillespie, but he was impeccable in building a great band. This set him apart as a leader and as the greatest bandleader in the history of jazz (this is my opinion).\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Miles, pianist Herbie Hancock, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, bassist Ron Carter, and seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams formed another quintet. This almost once-in-a-lifetime group recorded \"Kind of Blue,\" one of the greatest albums in music history. Miles constantly built amazing bands and tried out different musicians throughout his life.\n\nMiles always knew how he wanted his music to sound.\n\nNevertheless, he did not write all the works attributed to him. Miles always gave his all to the entire creative process. However, Miles occasionally acted rather irrationally when speaking with his band. “You’re all playing like a bunch of faggots,” Miles stated after so many takes on the recording of \"Aida.\"\n\nMiles and his experimentation with music\n\nI’ve changed music four or five times. What have you done of any importance other than be white?\n\nMiles, the Autobiography (1989)\n\nThis was his response to a society lady sitting next to him at a White House reception honoring Ray Charles in 1987 when she inquired about what he had done to be invited.\n\nThough I find this conversation with the society lady to be another irrational speaking of Miles, truthfully, Miles changed music, particularly the Jazz culture.\n\nMiles' influence is inextricably linked with Modal Jazz. Miles was not the founder of modal jazz, but he popularised it with the recordings of \"Milestones\" and \"Kind of Blue.\" Musicians like Bud Powell had experimented with modality, but Miles declared it a significant shift.\n\nThe music has gotten thick. Guys give me tunes and they’re full of chords. I can’t play them...I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords, and a return to emphasis on melodic rather than harmonic variation. There will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them.\n\n— About the new modal style. Interviewed by The Jazz Review (1958)\n\nMiles moved away from bebop’s tonality paradigm, in which artists employed chords to give background harmonic accompaniment for solos, and towards the usage of modes, modulating among them rather than relying on the conventional tonal center."
