        "text": "Experience the warmth of a homespun story, know the goodness of a true tale.......\n\nDonald Davis was a young United Methodist minister when the telephone rang one morning. \"It's your daddy,\" the caller said, \"Mama just couldn't get him awake this morning. He is gone.\"\n\n\"A million questions about him began to line themselves up in my mind.\" Davis writes. \"Where did he go to high school? I did not know.\" Did he get any education behind that? What were his early jobs, and where did he live then? I was now only twenty-eight, my father was dead, and I had been too young and immature to know to ask for the stories that would have filled out his life for me.\"\n\nThe surprise of a lifetime came when he called home and his recently departed father picked up the phone: \"Hello! This is Joe Davis. What can I do for you today?\"\n\n“From the photo on the cover ... to the strings of hilarious and touching stories, Donald Davis takes us on a journey. This is not just his story, however; as a master storyteller, he not only tells you about himself, but also strikes familiar notes that reach into each listener’s memory bank.”\n\n—New York Journal of Books\n\n\"A well-told story is comfort food for the soul, and Davis's book is nourishing.\"\n\n—Foreword Reviews\n\n“Davis’s nostalgic tales are filled with the stuff of fondly remembered boyhood....There’s a little drama here but lots that is sweetly good-natured and often quite funny. Davis operates in the tradition of the late Jean Shepherd (A Christmas Story), though without Shepherd’s occasional saltiness.... which would be inconsistent with the warm-hearted tone that works well for this homespun raconteur.”\n\n—Booklist\n\n\"Every time Donald Davis shares a story, he creates a miracle—a miracle of laughter, pure joy, and love.\"\n\n—Jimmy Neil Smith, founder and past president of the International Storytelling Center, Jonesborough, TN"
