Its primary purpose is mixing, and it has the capability of handling 5.1 surround mixes with 24-bit resolution, remaining entirely in the digital domain. The room has been acoustically treated and tuned for accuracy in music monitoring. It also has an ample isolation area with tie lines to accommodate the recording of small live instrumental ensembles, drums, vocals, and piano."
