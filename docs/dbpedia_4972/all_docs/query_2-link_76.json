        "text": "Rev. Dr. Don Davis is a well known and respected leader in the Christian community. This video was filmed when David Phillips, the founder of Brand 316 was able to introduce Brand 316 to over 50 Wichita area pastors. Davidâ€™s goal was to introduce the program to the pastors and to plant the seeds so that they fully understood that Brand 316 has created a solution for the formerly incarcerated through its intense and detailed reintegration training program. In this video, Dr. Davis shares his thoughts in reference to Brand 316 and the call to help those in need. We were thankful that Dr. Davis took the time to hear about Brand 316 as well as share his thoughts. We encourage you to listen to it in full and do more research on how you can support Brand 316, Inc and our goals of lowering recidivism through the personal, professional and spiritual development of the formerly incarcerated.\n\nLearn More about Rev.
