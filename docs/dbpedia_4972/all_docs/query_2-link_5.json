        "text": "Rep. Don Davis replaced retired Democrat Rep. G.K. Butterfield this year and represents the stateâs first district in the eastern part of the state.\n\nPopulating the walls of Davisâs Capitol Hill office are pictures of his time crisscrossing eastern North Carolina.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nRep. Don Davis replaced retired Democrat Rep. G.K. Butterfield this year\n\nDavis has bucked his party on a number of big votes in his first year in Congress\n\nDavis had a reputation as a moderate Democrat in the General Assembly\n\nâSo often people in the east feel left out, they feel left out in Raleigh, they feel left out in D.C.,â Davis said.\n\nBut itâs his time in D.C. that has raised questions among some in his own party.\n\nDavis has bucked his party on a number of big votes. He was one of just four Democrats to vote for a Republican defense bill that includes the elimination of diversity programs in the military and bans the defense department from reimbursing service members who have to travel out of state for an abortion.\n\nDavis called the legislation, which is before the Senate, a work in progress.\n\nMore recently, he voted for a controversial bill that would fund new military aid for Israel, but it would cut billions of dollars in spending at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe votes shouldnât come as a surprise. Davis was known as one of the most moderate Democrats in the North Carolina General Assembly.\n\nâThere will always be a little bit of pushback. But again, my task here is to explain even to our leadership that Iâm fighting for the people of eastern North Carolina,â Davis said.\n\nThe votes could help him in his district next year.\n\nThe composition of North Carolinaâs congressional delegation could change dramatically after next yearâs election.\n\nIf theyâre upheld by the courts, the stateâs newly drawn congressional district could cut the number of Democrats the state sends to Washington by half.\n\nOne of the Democrats potentially facing a tougher reelection is Davis.\n\nThe stateâs new congressional district lines, drawn by state Republican lawmakers, makes the first a swing district, the only one under the new map.\n\nâI believe that we will be fine in the election because people will look at our record, look at the fighter they have before them,â Davis said.\n\nA number of Republicans have lined up to run against Davis in 2024.\n\nIn Congress, Davis said heâs focused on passing a bipartisan farm bill, combating inflation and creating more jobs in eastern North Carolina in 2024."
