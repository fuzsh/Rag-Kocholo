I like to describe myself as a vessel of sound and experience music in spirit and colors. Everything is an instrument to me.\n\nThe past few years have been magical- releasing records with my band Painted Shield, releasing my EP, opening up for Kingfish and recording a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR to name a few. We continue to do big things-I keep creating and love to feel your energy at live performances!"
