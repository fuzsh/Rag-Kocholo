Some of them have phony keys under my name and email address, made by someone else as a trick. See gpg.html for my real key.\n\nRichard Stallman has cancer. Fortunately it is slow-growing and manageable follicular lymphoma. Treatment put it into remission, and he can expect to live many more years. However, he now has to be even more careful not to catch Covid-19.\n\nFSF Giving Guide\n\nRobert Reich explains how the bullshitter and Republicans are trying to spread chaos to discourage non-fascists from voting. After creating as much real chaos as they can, they pretend there is even more of it, hoping Americans will give up and not vote, or support a fascist strong man.\n\nI urge you to vote in Democratic primaries for the progressive candidate, if there is one. And in the final election I urge you to vote for Democrats, unless a liberal independent had a good chance of winning.\n\nCanadians: I suggest you seek election advice at a local chapter of a group that pushes to curb global heating and has the courage to say, \"Canada should stop exporting fossil fuel.\" It will at least use the right goals to suggest who to vote for in your area.\n\nJoin a Friday climate strike.\n\nThat page is made by scraping Fridays for Future so you can get the information without running any Javascript code. I would be very glad if they made the information on their own site accessible from the Free World; then we could simply refer people to their site and do without the scraping etc.\n\nI am limiting the number of new political notes per day so as not to overload the volunteers who install new notes. If you'd like to help, please write to rms at gnu period org.\n\nIs your bank pressuring you to use biometric ID? If so, please write to rms at gnu dot org. It could be useful if you document what is happening.\n\nPlease join the Free Software Foundation to support its work for your freedom.\n\n\"They\" is plural â€” for singular antecedents, use singular gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nLink Policy\n\nThe largest part of the site is the political notes, and they are typically updated every day.\n\nI'm looking for people to\n\ncraft and post my political notes\n\nsend me examples of how proprietary programs have been designed to be addictive.\n\ncheck a few sites for me regularly and show me any new articles that I would like to see or link to. If you would like to help me in this way, please write to rms at gnu dot o r g.\n\nhelp me in maintaining stallman.org by occasionally looking for articles on a given point in the news.\n\nsend me examples of how proprietary programs have been designed to cause programmed obsolescence of products.\n\nwrite site-specific Firefox extensions or local scripts to operate specific web sites.\n\nhelp maintain and operate savannah.gnu.org.\n\nexperiment to find good ways to attach fruits to a Grav-mass tree.\n\nhelp web sites put free licenses on their Javascript code.\n\nCivil Liberties Minute:\n\nThe four factors of the apocalypse:\n\nglobal heating, global hating,\n\nglobal eating, global mating.\n\n[More Cartoons]\n\nCopy this button (courtesy of R.Siddharth) to express your rejection of Facebook.\n\nE-books\n\nNon-oppressive Commercial E-books\n\nDon't use Facebook\n\nFacebook's face recognition demonstrates a threat to everyone's privacy. I therefore ask people not to put photos of me on Facebook; you can do likewise.\n\nOf course, Facebook is bad for many other reasons as well.\n\nBoycott Harry Potter Books, Movies, etc.\n\nInternet Music EULAS\n\nBusiness Supremacy Treaties\n\nCountries to Stay Away From\n\nNo national identity cards\n\nI'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at gnu.org.\n\nHere's my list of countries with no national ID cards and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK. Australia's previous government tried to institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped the plan.\n\nIndia has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number in a grand act of oppression.\n\nSwitzerland has national ID cards which are optional, but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.\n\nIceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently. For example, the national ID number is often required to rent a video or use a gym.\n\nDenmark issues non-photo ID cards with a \"person number\", and many services use this card to identify people.\n\nNorway will impose a national biometric ID card.\n\nIreland - national ID card by stealth.\n\nACLU: the five dangers of national ID cards.\n\nWikipedia has a list of identity card policies by country.\n\nBorders\n\nStay away from certain countries because of their bad immigration policies.\n\nFlight connections\n\nAvoid flight connections in these airports because of their treatment of passengers.\n\nThe Lifelong Activist\n\nPeople often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for years without burning out. The best way I can answer is by recommending a book, The Lifelong Activist by Hillary Rettig.\n\nI disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as being marketing and sales, because those terms refer to business, and politics is something much more important than mere business. However, this doesn't diminish the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing techniques from marketing and sales.\n\nDisclosure: I am friends with the author.\n\nBob Chassell\n\nWriting (mostly science fiction) by my friend Bob Chassell who recently died.\n\nSolidarity Economy and Free Software\n\nPersonal Declaration of Richard Stallman and Euclides Mance on Solidarity Economy and Free Software.\n\nFalkvinge articles\n\nI have reposted some of Rick Falkvinge's articles. As posted on his site, you can't see them in a browser without running some nonfree Javascript code which is apparently non-free. These versions show the same text, without the obstacle."
