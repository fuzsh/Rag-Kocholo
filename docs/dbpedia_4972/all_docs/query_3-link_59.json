        "text": "Miles Davis – Porgy And Bess\n\nMiles Davis – Summertime\n\nIn a little less than a week, I’m going to leave for tour with my youth symphony. Don’t worry, you’ll still get your bi-weekly music posts (but I won’t be writing them). We’re going to central Europe, and the people who organized the tour requested a set filled with American songs. As such, we’re playing the famous “Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture.” It’s an arrangement done by Robert Russell Bennett that consists of a medley of songs from the original opera of Porgy and Bess, whose music was written by George Gershwin. Considering that the opera’s music was heavily influenced by African-American spirituals and folk songs that eventually became jazz, it was a perfect fit to turn into a more jazz-like setting. Miles Davis did just that, enlisting the help of arranger and conductor Gil Evans and a modified big band featuring trumpets, trombones, horns, tuba, three kinds of flutes, two kinds of clarinets, only one saxophone, and bass and drums. The entire album is 50 minutes long, and I suggest you listen to all of it, but I’ll be focusing on the most famous song from Gershwin’s opera, “Summertime.” Then, on Sunday, I’ll talk about the Russell Bennett arrangement and compare and contrast the two, which will serve as a vehicle to talk about the major structural differences between jazz and classical music.\n\n“Summertime” starts out with Miles riffing on the original melody of the opera version, although he eventually ditches that melody entirely and straight improvises. At the time, Davis was experimenting with modal jazz, jazz not based on chord changes, but on different scales and modes, and you can hear that he is soloing over a pentatonic scale. Incidentally, the melody of “Summertime” is almost completely pentatonic, much like another piece based on African-American folk songs. You can hear that the chord itself doesn’t really change, given that the woodwind background doesn’t change pitch much. Well, that’s the entire song. Miles Davis soloing as only Miles Davis can (he really has a distinctive tone and style, even while muted as he is on this song) over some backgrounds. It’s simple, yet it always sounds fresh because of the musical ideas that Davis implements in his solo.\n\nThat is the main difference between the two that I will talk about in this post (come back Sunday for more!) is that this one is all improvisation whereas the classical version has no improvisation. While it’s true that there are classical songs with improvisation (example that I am planning on doing a Sunday Classical on at some point) and I’m sure there are jazz songs with no improvisation (although I don’t listen to them), this is overall true of most songs of each genre. I already talked about how this represents the composer more in classical and the artist more in jazz in a previous Wednesday Jazz.\n\nCome back on Sunday when I’ll talk about the classical version of this song, compare and contrast the two a bit more, and talk about how I can like two genres that are so unbelievably separate."
