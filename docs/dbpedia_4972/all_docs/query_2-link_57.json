        "text": "\"Don, I want to thank you for all of the time and advice you have given me over the years. As someone who makes a living meeting with businesses and major companies about aspects of advertising and marketing, I have had a wide variety of exposure to diverse mindsets and business strategies over the past few decades, and I have always been amazed at how some businesses seem to have a kind of magic touch. Yours is one of those businesses.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I appreciate all of the advice and expertise that you have been so willing to share with me in such an easily-digestible manner and with such clarity. I have so often left meetings with you thinking, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I think of that? It makes perfect sense!‚Äù\n\nYour advice to me concerning strategies to acquire and keep good employees was particularly eye opening and so helpful as that has historically been the most difficult part of running a business for me. Our conversations have always been a calm and comfortable experience and I appreciate how freely you offer your guidance in times when I find myself most in need of it. You have really been an invaluable asset to me as a business owner.\"\n\nRick I. - Business Owner\n\n(click below to see more testimonials)\n\n\"I am writing to recommend Don Davis. I have known and had the pleasure of working with Don Davis for over 15 years. Don Davis has consistently proven himself to be an innovative and dedicated business owner. He is always on the cutting edge of trends in his industry and this has led to the success of his businesses on many levels.\n\nHis energy and leadership permeates his business environment leading to happy employees and repeat customers. His integrity and business ethics ensure vendors try to do everything they can for him to be certain of mutual success. He develops long term relationships due to the positive business environment he cultivates.\n\nHis success in business has led to a substantial amount of community involvement. Don is always donating his resources to improving the lives of others and the community. He actively donates to many causes in the community.\n\nDon also motivates those around him and has strong leadership and mentorship skills transforming the lives of those around him. Helping them to grow and prosper. Don is the tide that raises all ships and I have been fortunate to have been part of that rising tide.\"\n\nJulie T. - Account Executive\n\n(click below to see more testimonials)\n\n\"I have had the pleasure of knowing and doing business with Don Davis since the spring of 1993. He has a real passion for quality and ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù, and is consistently seeking ways to improve his personal and professional life. Whether it‚Äôs a small course correction or a major business decision, you get the feeling that it‚Äôs the quality of the next decision that is on his mind. And the compound effect of this decision making process shows up in ways that benefit the people around him, and I think that‚Äôs very important to him.\n\nThere have been times when I have gone over ideas with him, and even though it wasn‚Äôt a fit at the time, I still felt that he listened and gave the idea consideration. This actually may be his greatest asset, a philosophy of asking questions and listening, and then carefully proceeding (or not, in some cases üôÇ).\n\nI also think of him as a giver and someone who gets behind causes he believes in. Life is short, and it‚Äôs not what you have but who you become that defines you. And being a positive, thoughtful and genuine person is the core of what makes Don a success not only in business but in life.\"\n\nDonn R. - Manufacturer's Representative\n\n(click below to see more testimonials)"
