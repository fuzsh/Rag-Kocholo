        "text": "Neil Brown, Jr has booked a recurring role opposite Issa Rae and Yvonne Orji in HBO comedy series Insecure. Created, executive produced and starring Rae, the eight-episode series looks at the friendship of two black women and their uncomfortable experiences and racy tribulations. Brown will play Chad, a fast-talking “player,” but loyal to his friends. Brown was recently cast in BBC America’s Dirk Gently series and can next be seen in the feature Sandcastle opposite Henry Cavill. He’s repped by Don Buchwald & Associates and David Dean Management.\n\nJamie Ward (Septembers of Shiraz) has signed on for a recurring role in the third season of FX drama series Tyrant. It revolves around an unassuming American family drawn into the inner workings of a turbulent fictional Middle Eastern nation. Al-Fayeed, younger son of the war-torn country’s dictator, ends a self-imposed 20-year exile to return to his homeland. His reluctant homecoming leads to a dramatic clash of cultures as he is thrown back into the familial and national politics of his youth. Ward will play Nabil. He will next be seen opposite Adrien Brody, Selma Hayek and Shohreh Aghdashloo in Septembers of Shiraz, set for release next month. He also starred in thriller The Rezort with Dougray Scott and Jessica DeGouw, and appeared in British series The Durrells on ITV. Ward is repped by Abrams Artists Agency, Creative Artists Management in the UK, Gallant Management and Linsten Morris Management."
