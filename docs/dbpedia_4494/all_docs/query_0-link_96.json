        "text": "American film composer Mark Isham (b. 1951) began his career in films nearly four decades ago when he scored Carroll Ballard’s long-forgotten and highly underestimated “Never Cry Wolf” (1983). Since then, the Primetime Emmy Award and Grammy Award winner, who was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, has worked with august filmmakers such as Robert Altman, Gillian Armstrong, Kathryn Bigelow, Brian De Palma, Mike Figgis, Jodie Foster, William Friedkin, Paul Haggis, Werner Herzog, Sidney Lumet, Peter Medak, Robert Redford, Karel Reisz, Kevin Reynolds, Barbet Schroeder and Irwin Winkler. He scored eight films for Alan Rudolph, three for Gavin O’Connor and Gary Fleder, and two for Paul Haggis.\n\nHis outstanding musical voice can be heard in numerous memorable scores and films. No matter what film genre, his enormous body of work demonstrates his ability to amaze the listener with his talent whenever he creates evocative and inspiring musical worlds.\n\nRobert Redford, with whom he made “A River Runs Through It” (1992), “Quiz Show” (1994), “Lions for Lambs” (2007) and “The Conspirator” (2010), once said, ‘Mark is a man who really lives his craft. One of the most attractive features about him is that he knows how to keep things simple. I like music that is subtle but still supports the drama and is there for a reason, and Mark did that so beautifully.’\n\nLast month, Film Fest Ghent welcomed this versatile American musician, trumpeter, keyboardist and film composer as a guest of honor for its 22nd edition of the World Soundtrack Awards at the Bijloke Concert Hall. After being invited, Mr. Isham responded by saying, ‘I am very grateful to be honored by the WSA this year. This is such a highly respected organization that does so much to support and promote the art of film composition. It will be a great treat to perform and take part in all of the events.’\n\nThe following interview with this high-profile and very productive film composer was conducted at Film Fest Ghent, where he talked about his long and rewarding career, his craft and his working methods.\n\nMr. Isham, it’s been many years since you scored “Never Cry Wolf.” What’s the secret of being so successful all those years?\n\nI don’t think there’s any secret. It’s just hard work, and I love doing it. I put in a lot of time. It’s that simple.\n\nHow does the process work for you, from the moment you get involved in a project?\n\nWhen I accept a job, I watch the film. Sometimes I get hired before there’s a film to look at, and that’s not so easy for me, to write a score with just a script because I love to watch the images, I like to see the colors, the ambiance of that universe. What is that world that this director is creating? What sound expresses that, what sound belongs there, what sound is a part of that world? So it’s really a sense of getting that sound. If it’s an electronic score, I will design and do sounds. Just one note—what does a G sound like in that world? If it’s a more traditional score and I know it needs and will benefit from traditional instruments, then what instrument is it, or do I just start with the piano and do a beautiful melody first? The story will tell me what the best way is to start writing my film score.\n\nIs the film director your most important collaborator, or maybe the editor, or the music editor too?\n\nIf differs on every project. Most of the time, it is the director. He has the vision, that’s the vision you need to duplicate and be a part of—he’s the team leader. But every film has a slightly different dynamic of personnel; sometimes there is a very strong producer who has a lot of opinions and is a partner with the director, or is controlling the director as I observed in some cases. Other times—yes, you mentioned the editor—there is a very strong editor who puts music in himself, let’s say. That happens more and more, I’ve seen in the last five years or so. Picture editors love to cut to music and they will first ask for a temporary score. In that case, it’s definitely in my best interest to get to know the picture editor, his opinions and his reasons for making choices, and see how the relation between the director and the picture editor is. And sometimes there is a very strong music editor, but not always. So it changes with every project.\n\nIn the end, do you usually have total autonomy over your work?\n\nNo [laughs]. I mean, I feel that I can stay in control of the score and I don’t let anything out of my world into their world unless I know that I approve and love it, and think it is correct. I don’t give them anything that I have second thoughts about. So in that sense, yes, I control the score. Am I a part of the team? Yes. Do I respond to others’ opinions, do I find the groove, dynamic opinion and fit myself into that to be an effective team player? Yes. Do I try and offer perhaps unique solutions that are of my creation? Yes. But ultimately, the director and the producers are the leaders of this team and they will have a final say, and there are even people above them—in a lot of cases the studio and the people with the chequebook. So we’re all working from that point of view.\n\nWhat is the first thing that you give your directors when you’re at work? Demos?\n\nYes, I demo the entire score and they sound like the real thing. I have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into a studio, into samples and computers, and I have the ability—as do most film composers—to present a score almost like it will sound by the end of the day. Many filmmakers don’t trust themselves enough to understand music or know what it will sound like if you just give them a piano demo. So all of us invest in a lot of technology to make really good-sounding demos that sound almost as good as the real thing. Sometimes I bring musicians in, so I can do the whole score in my studio if I have to.\n\nDo you know who was the first one to do that?\n\nHans Zimmer was the first one to do it really well. I saw what he was doing, and I thought, ‘I’d better learn how to do that, or else I’ll be out of work’ [laughs]. And now everybody does that.\n\nHow did you begin with your studio?\n\nIn the beginning and when I was young, I was in the bedroom, on the bed. It took the mattress off and put the gear on the bed. Now I have a building, but it took me many, many years to get there. But you can do it in a very small space, if necessary. The technology these days is remarkable; you can do it on a laptop.\n\n“A River Runs Through It” (1992, trailer)\n\nAre there scores of yours that you consider your proudest achievements?\n\nOh my goodness [laughs]. “A River Runs Through It” [1992] is a beautiful score that stood the test of time. “The Black Dahlia” [2006] is a beautiful score too. I also love the score I wrote for a television series, called “American Crime” [2015-2016]. But it’s like picking your favorite child, you can’t do that.\n\nYou did “The Black Dahlia” for Brian De Palma, but you have the distinction to have worked with numerous wonderful filmmakers. Could you talk about Sidney Lumet and “Night Falls on Manhattan” [1996], because he hardly used any music in his films. Do you remember the first time you met him?\n\nI remember very distinctly. I don’t know if he had hired me yet; he said, ‘Right now, this film has very little music in it, and several of my films have no music at all. So this could be my next.’ He didn’t know if he needed any music. If you look at his style—he was not overly musical, but when he used music, it was right to the point. And I think we ended up with thirteen minutes of music. He was a very gracious and, obviously, immensely talented film director. A real gentleman and a fantastic storyteller.\n\nSo are you, since you also give a voice to your films; you tell the story from your point of view.\n\nI think a lot of composers—so-called classical composers, I think that’s the right definition—like to write programmatic music that tells a story, but a film composer has to do that. That’s his job. And it has to be exact, like right now, when it happens. It’s an interesting skill. I love it because it demands that you learn about the language of music. If you have to express utter joy and then two minutes and seventeen seconds later it has to go to tragedy and utter despair, that’s a skill to be able to get there aesthetically and musically in a way that it feels natural and tells that story. I find that doing that, year after year, just taught me more and more about the language of music, and how to tell the story with that language. Certain demands teach you what you didn’t know the day before, and I love that. That’s maybe the answer to your first question—what’s the secret? Well, that’s part of it, for me: I always keep learning more and more about music, and I think the most sublime language we have is culture.\n\nSince film is all about emotions, and music is all about emotions, you have to combine both of them. How difficult is it to come up each time with something that’s different from all the other work you have done?\n\nThat’s exactly what makes the profession of film composers a joy and a challenge. Each film is different and with his story, the director is looking for this unique point in time; I take it as a challenge to find a unique sound to make it match that.\n\n“Night Falls on Manhattan” (1996, trailer)\n\nDid you ever turn down any offers because you couldn’t relate to the subject or maybe you couldn’t find what was necessary musically?\n\n[Long pause] No, I don’t think I have. People have chosen me or asked me to work with them because they see that connection, so I think everything that I have accepted has been the right connection.\n\nWhen are you satisfied with the score that you wrote?\n\nI usually have those moments when I’m all by myself, at three or five o’clock in the morning, when I’ve been there for a long time. Because I make demos, I can play them back against the picture. Then I stop being a composer and become the audience—by myself—and watch, and I can have those experiences like, ‘That’s good, you did good on that. That’s working’ [laughs]. Then I feel that I have achieved in myself what I want to achieve for others, and I have the confidence to put it out into the world.\n\nWhat was for you the best training ground you had in your formative years?\n\nI just did it. I am completely self-taught, I’ve never gone to school. I lasted three months in college. I was writing a lot of music for myself and some of that fell into the hands of a film director who said, ‘I really like that music. Would you write a film score?’ Little did I know what it would take to do that. The first one took me four and a half months, and I learned how to do it by doing it. Very fortunately, I had a very patient director who believed in me and he let me take the time; he worked with me. I would start in the morning and he would come by at seven or eight o’clock at night to see the results of the day’s work, and we made our way through the film. So I have been very fortunate in that sense to work with people that believed in me and gave me that opportunity.\n\nYour body of work is incredible. Do you have any time left to do something else other than writing film scores?\n\n[Laughs] I have time. I am very happily married and I have four children. I went to all their football games when they were young. Even though they’re grown, they still live at home. We have this big house with two music studios, two film studios and an art studio. So the children stay at home because it’s a beautiful place to live. We’re all artists and we all have these big family dinners, so that’s all good. What I try to put some time in, is to continue to play the trumpet. That has fallen away, but I’m practicing again and I hope to do more concerts. I enjoy that.\n\nBut other than that, I suppose you’re a film composer who works efficiently and very fast?\n\nI’m not slow, I can write quickly. That’s just experience; I can cut to the chase. If I think about a project, if I can really do my homework, talk to the director and if I understand what he wants, and we talk about the temporary music that they have put in the film, if I understand why they like it and I’ve done all that homework, then—composing-wise—I can get where I need to go pretty quickly. The only time I make a mistake is if I don’t do that homework, if I don’t communicate. Then I miss a concept in the filmmaker’s world.\n\nHow much or how little time do you need to write a score?\n\nThat depends on the number of minutes of the score. At a certain point, you’re building a wall and you have to put a number of bricks in the wall. Some scores are twenty-five minutes long, others are ninety-five minutes long. And ninety-five minutes of music, that’s a project; that takes a very long time to write, and sometimes we have to do that. That can take months. A twenty-five-minute score I can do in three weeks.\n\nConsidering your film output, I suppose you also work on different projects at the same time?\n\nYes. That can be a challenge. Sometimes I divide it up, like working on something three days in a row. Depending on the deadlines, it can be a half day-half day.\n\nDo you have a favorite time of the day to write your score?\n\nI do. But it has changed over the years. Before I had children, it would be the night shift and I would start at about ten or eleven in the morning. The golden hour would be between, let’s say between eight PM and two AM; then it’s very quiet, nothing there. But then you have children and it changes. If I have deadlines now and I need the golden hour, I would get up early in the morning and start at about five AM. Between five and ten in the morning, I get a tremendous amount of work done.\n\n“The Black Dahlia” (2006, trailer)\n\nAnd when do you start sending your music to the director, editor,…?\n\nI like to do fifteen or twenty minutes of the score—the highlights, you know. I don’t start at the beginning usually; I start with the most important scene. Maybe I might do a less important scene first, just to get warmed up. When I was younger, it was hard for me to confront the most important scene right away and I would first write other stuff until I thought, ‘Oh, I still got the most important scenes and I only got a week left’ [laughs]. So I don’t do that anymore. I try to confront the major parts of the score, the hardest, the ones that express what this story is all about, and get that under my belt. And so, with that first pass, I like to have chosen enough spots that represent to the filmmaker, ‘This is your score, these are your themes, and this is the way it’s gonna travel across the story.’\n\nThe way you talk about your craft so beautifully, you make it sound so easy.\n\n[Laughs] Well, you know, after all those years I don’t consider it hard. It just takes time. It does take time. I need the time to do it correctly.\n\nAre you familiar with the work of the old masters, like Max Steiner or Franz Waxman?\n\nI’m certainly aware of them and there are certain scores that I know, but as I told you, I didn’t go to school for this, I never studied film music. So can I give you precise examples? No, I’m afraid I can’t. Obviously, the ones I do know better are Jerry Goldsmith and John Barry, the generation just before me. I had the chance to meet them both and that was a great pleasure. But part of me preserves my own view on it and I don’t listen to a lot of other film music. I do occasionally, just to make sure I’m not missing a trend so that when directors talk to me and say, ‘Oh, I just heard that score and I want that!’—I understand what they’re saying and I need to know what they’re talking about. But I also like to preserve my world, and if you’re coming to me, then I can give you something that’s not just a potpourri of what’s happening now. I can preserve to a certain degree my own point of view because that is why you come to me.\n\nFilm Fest Ghent, Belgium\n\nOctober 21, 2022\n\nFILMS\n\nNEVER CRY WOLF (1983) DIR Carroll Ballard PROD Lewis Allen, Jack Couffer, Joseph Strick SCR Curtis Hanson, Richard Kletter, Sam Hamm (book “Never Cry Wolf: Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves” [1963] by Farley Mowat) CAM Hiro Narita ED Peter Parasheles, Michael Chandler MUS Mark Isham CAST Charles Martin Smith, Brian Dennehy, Zachary Ittimangnaq, Samson Jorah, Hugh Webster, Martha Ittimangnaq\n\nMRS.
