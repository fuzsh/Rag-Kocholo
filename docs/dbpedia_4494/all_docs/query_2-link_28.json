Jack also helps get Jenna an audition to play Janis Joplin.\n\nGeneralissimo\n\nJack's resemblance to an evil telenovela character has him on the outs with Elisa's grandmother, and Liz tries to begin a relationship with a new neighbour after accidentally receiving his mail.\n\nSt. Valentine's Day\n\nLiz insists that she and Drew have their first official date on Valentine's Day, and Elisa brings Jack to church to celebrate the day, which is very different from the way he traditionally celebrates."
