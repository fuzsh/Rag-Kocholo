After moving to the United States, Hayek initially struggled as an actress. In 1995, however, she found early acclaim for her performance in the drama Midaq Alley (El Callejon de los Milagros) and obtained her Hollywood breakthrough in the action-orientated Desperado, directed by Robert Rodriguez, who would become a frequent collaborator. She soon established herself in Hollywood with roles that relied significantly on her sex appeal in films such as From Dusk till Dawn (1996), Wild Wild West (1999) and Dogma (1999).\n\nHayek founded her production company, Ventanarosa, in 1999, through which she produces film and television projects. The biographical film Frida (2002) —in which she served as a producer and portrayed painter Frida Kahlo— made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress[1] and, in addition, earned her Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and British Academy Film Award nominations. She has since starred in a diverse list of films, including Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), After the Sunset (2004), Bandidas (2006), Grown Ups (2010), Grown Ups 2 (2013), Tale of Tales (2015), Beatriz at Dinner (2017), The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017), Eternals (2021) and House of Gucci (2021). She has also lent her voice for the animated Puss in Boots (2011), The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! (2012), Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet (2014), Sausage Party (2016) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022).\n\nHayek has received seven ALMA Awards nominations and was the recipient of the 2009 Anthony Quinn Award for Achievement in Motion Pictures by the association.[2] Her directing, producing and acting work on television has garnered Hayek four Emmy Award nominations. She won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children Special for The Maldonado Miracle (2004) and received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, one for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and the other for Outstanding Comedy Series, for her work on the ABC series Ugly Betty (2006–10). She has also been the recipient of Glamour magazine Woman of the Year Award in 2001, the Producers Guild of America Celebration of Diversity Award in 2003, the Harvard Foundation Artist of the Year Award in 2006, and the Franca Sozzani Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2018.[3] In 2011, Hayek was appointed Knight (Chevalier) of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, the highest French order of merit,[4] and in 2021, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[5]\n\nScreen credits\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1993 Mi Vida Loca Gata 1994 Roadracers Donna TV movie 1995 El Callejón de los Milagros Alma Desperado Carolina Four Rooms TV Dancing Girl Fair Game Rita 1996 From Dusk till Dawn Santanico Pandemonium Follow Me Home Betty Fled Cora 1997 Fools Rush In Isabel Fuentes The Hunchback Esmeralda TV movie Breaking Up Monica Sístole Diástole Carmelita Short 1998 54 Anita Randazzo The Velocity of Gary Mary Carmen Welcome to Hollywood Herself The Faculty Nurse Harper 1999 Dogma Serendipity El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba Julia Wild Wild West Rita Escobar 2000 Timecode Rose Chain of Fools Sergeant Meredith La gran vida Lola Traffic Rosario 2001 Hotel Charlee Boux In the Time of the Butterflies Minerva Mirabal TV movie 2002 Frida Frida Kahlo Also producer 2003 Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over Francesca Once Upon a Time in Mexico Carolina 2004 After the Sunset Lola Cirillo 2006 Bandidas Sara Sandoval Ask the Dust Camilla Lopez Lonely Hearts Martha Beck 2007 Across the Universe Bang Bang Shoot Shoot Nurses 2009 Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant Madame Truska 2010 Grown Ups Roxanne Chase-Feder 2011 Americano Lola Puss in Boots Kitty Softpaws (voice) La chispa de la vida Luisa Gómez 2012 The Pirates!
