        "text": "A string of ’90s hits launched Salma Hayek’s career: She and Antonio Banderas sizzled in Desperado, she stuck her foot in Quentin Tarantino’s mouth in From Dusk Till Dawn, and starred opposite peak-Friends Matthew Perry in fan favorite rom-com Fools Rush In. Wild Wild West with Will Smith was decidedly not a hit, but one of those bizarre epic Hollywood misfires whose stature only grows with time.\n\nHayek got her only Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for 2002’s Frida, her Certified Fresh biopic about the Mexican art icon. Soon after, she and Banderas and Robert Rodriguez wrapped up their Mexico trilogy with Once Upon a Time in Mexico, which was preceded by Desperado and El Mariachi. She again reunited with Banderas for Puss in Boots, whipped out the guns for Everly, and gave a layered, dramatic performance recently in Beatriz at Dinner.\n\nRecently, she’s basking in the filmography-best reviews for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, along with Magic Mike’s Last Dance. Now, we’re ranking all Salma Hayek movies by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 105410%\n\nCritics Consensus: Arriving more than a decade after the previous installment, the smart, sweet, and funny Puss in Boots: The Last Wish proves some franchises only get better with age.\n\nSynopsis: This fall, everyone's favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns.
