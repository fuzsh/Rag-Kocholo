        "text": "Speculation abounds regarding the invisibility of collections hidden from the public by institutions and individuals alike. Removed from cultural circulation, it is less frequent that such works are intentionally relegated to unceasing slumber. When such collections are displayed for the public, a simultaneous opening up of potentiality, audience and creative engagement is implicated. Yet, what if the collection or the artwork no longer exists in the conventional sense of a tangible art object? What if the object was ephemeral, with all records of its existence buried under a mythological façade of epic exaggeration and unwarranted demonisation? Such was the fate of the Jašn-e Honar-e Shiraz or The Festival of Arts, Shiraz-Persepolis, a ground-breaking international festival of performing arts held annually in Iran every summer between 1967 – 1977, in and around the city of Shiraz and the ancient ruins of Persepolis. The intellectual drive behind the festival, its modus operandi, as well as its aesthetic content constitute a highly enduring, contested space despite the passage of a half a century, reflecting the festival’s complex nature. This stands in contrast to most other concurrent pre-revolutionary cultural initiatives, like the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA), which have been retrospectively endorsed and validated by artists and cultural practitioners who have inherited their material and intellectual assets. Given the recent opening up of TMoCA’s internationally significant art collection to a public audience (albeit outside of Iran), it is even more important to re-examine and reconsider the festival’s artwork and to reintegrate that material into cultural memory and discourse.\n\nThis brief paper is part of documents uploaded and made available to members of the Illinois Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance who attended that organization’s annual conference in St. Charles, Illinois, November 14-17, 2018. It was not delivered at the conference but is intended to supplement a teaching presentation of a contemporary Persian concert dance choreography. Its scope is limited to provide a rudimentary discussion of dance styles not usually taught outside the general Iranian community but worthy of exploration within a teaching framework, particularly in the cross-cultural context. Dancing associated with the many ethnic groups in Iran and the greater surrounding region is often preserved as part of the identity of Iranians in the diaspora, along with stylized art dance performances developed in Iran during the twentieth century. Additionally, Iranians and other interested dancers have used many dance styles to form new fusions with Iranian dance and music to tell the traditional stories of the region. Meanwhile, performers within Iran have found creative ways to portray and practice movement since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nThe Arab Theatre Festival is an annual event organized in a different Arab country each year by the Arab Theatre Institute.[1] This year's session chose Morocco as the host nation.[2] The Festival took place in the capital Rabat between January 10 and 16, 2015, and was attended by theatre representatives from around the Arab world.[3] This seventh version of the Festival also corresponded with Morocco celebrating the passage of one hundred years since the establishment of a modern theatre tradition there. This gave the festival a particular focus and marked this year as one of the most notable in the history of the Arab Theatre Institute. Ismail Abdellah, the secretary-general of the institute, during a press talk held a day before the opening of the festival, confirmed that all indications promised that the seventh session of the Arab Theatre Festival, the \"Moroccanized\" version, fully supported by the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, would be a great success as groundwork. He added that the institute had been looking forward to such an event since its launch in 2009, and predicted that the occasion would constitute \"a new turn in the history of the Festival.\" The Moroccan Minister of Culture, Mohamed Amine Sbihi, announced during the opening ceremony that the seventh celebration, which was being held under the patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, expected the participation of about five hundred Arab attendants belonging to the field of theatre and performance arts, and that a hundred of them would be from Morocco. He added that the event's effects would not be limited to the area of the capital (Rabat), but extended to reach other cities around the kingdom. All of the cultural centers around Morocco were activated during that period and hosted different cultural activities reflecting the atmosphere of the two ceremonies that were being coordinated: The Arab Theatre Festival and the Centenary of Moroccan Theatre. The Seventh Arab Theatre Festival was marked by the organization of cultural activities of various types. One of the most important elements was the presentation of about seventy plays, of which seven dramas competed for the prize of Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, rewarding the best Arab theatrical show of the year 2014. The tradition of presenting such an award was established as an attempt to keep the Arab theatre active and encourage Arab dramaturgy to carry on updating itself, contemplating, and reflecting upon some of the most prevalent current issues. Moreover, the Festival held the largest scientific conference ever in the domain of theatre and performance studies organized in the Arab world. Six panels of various research topics were enriched by discussions led by some of the most prominent figures in Arab theatre and performance studies. The festival honored twenty-two Arab artists and organized workshops, training for the benefit of theater amateurs, animating workshops dedicated to children, and allotted, next to the Festival's Book Fair, a large space to signatures (book launches) of new theatrical releases. This last activity, together with press conferences related to competing plays, was organized inside the Mohamed V Theatre.\n\nThe highlights of Iranian theatre in the last 12 months (1394–1395 Persian calendar) include highly acclaimed stage performances, festivals, and theatrical events and major theatre research and publications. As in previous years, Iranian theatre and its artists have been struggling with economic and logistic challenges such as the budget deficit, mismanagement, lack of sufficient facilities and venues, and state interventions. Despite these challenges, the new state policies and statistics indicate a dramatic increase in the number of performances and audience members. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has named the last two years consecutively the \" Year of Theatre \" and has allocated more funding and attention to the development of drama, theatre, and performance. State authorities also support the project of theatre privatization by making theatre independent of state funds, although limiting state funding does not mean there will be a limit to the state's power in vetting theatrical content and form. Although pursuing the project of theatre privatization has resulted in the commercialization of acting and dramaturgy, state officials hope that privatization policies lead to the de-monopolization of theatre and the inclusion of artists from different backgrounds, especially women, and to reaching out to diverse audiences. As a result, 2016 experienced an explosion in the quantity and quality of rehearsal spaces and performance venues. More than 30 private performance venues were established all over the capital city, Tehran, within the last year. Strikingly, state politicians, minister, and members of parliament began going to theatres and admiring theatre artists. For instance, in January 2016, the Foreign Affairs Minister watched a historical play about a 19th-century eminent, reformist politician, A Clothes Keeper's Memories and Nightmares of the Life and Murder of Mirzā Taqi Khan-e Farāhāni, written and directed by Ali Rafei. In 2016 Iranian stages hosted an array of stories and styles: ranging from original Iranian plays, to Iranian adaptations of classic and contemporary works of Euro-American theatre repertoires, to productions created through cross-cultural collaborations. In terms of thematic choices, a wide variety of themes (addiction, infidelity, women, religious tolerance, war, etc.) were theatricalized. And artists implemented a wide variety of styles including realistic social plays, comedy, therapeutic psychodramas, stylized ritualistic performances, parody, and minimal abstract plays. Broadly speaking, the number of stage performances increased from 551 in the first half of 2015 to 842 performances in the same period in 2016. Among these licensed plays, 410 shows were specifically written by Iranian artists, 68 plays were for children and youth, and 19 plays were staged for women audiences specifically. In addition to stage performances, street theatre, play reading, and Ta'ziyeh (Persian commemorative, passion plays)"
