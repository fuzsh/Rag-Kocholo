        "text": "Disability has been portrayed in cinema for many years and is still a sensitive topic open for discourse on how it objectifies and exploits a ‘different’ body. The release of Tod Browning’s film Freaks in 1930 and its subsequent 30-year-ban perfectly illustrate what intense feelings and perceptions our society had of the notion of disability at that time. The 1930s Victorian audience was outraged by the depiction of the ‘real’ disabled actors’ bodies. It was equally unprepared for the fact that the film follows the everyday backstage life of the circus show’s disabled performers and their relationships. Furthermore, in the movie ‘freaks’ collectively disfigure the only ‘able-bodied’ star amongst them, which had only intensified the adverse reaction (Larsen and Haller, 2002). Works by Michel Foucault, a 20th-century French philosopher, allow interpreting the representation of a disabled body and how it became an ‘object and target of power’ (Rabinow, 1984). His concepts of sexuality and medicine, alongside with works by other critics, will be used to analyse the approach to disability in such films like The Elephant Man (1980) by David Lynch and I Don’t Want to Talk About It (1993) by María Luisa Bemberg.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to explore the interconnection between the body and structure, by drawing on the intersection of gender and disability. It is argued that within contemporary gender studies, a gap exists between gender and the body, in such a way that feminists fail to account for the concrete, embodied experiences of oppression faced by women. The cultural model of disability, studying both the physical limitations of disability as well as the way in which disabled people navigate through their environment, is thus argued to potentially offer a new perspective on the interrelationship between gender and the body. This is illustrated by examining two films released in 2012: De Rouille et D'Os, and The Sessions, for the way in which they represent the embodied experience of disability, and well as gender.\n\nWhat ideological meanings about gendered disabilities are reflected and produced in cinema? The disabled body easily conveys meaning without speech. Disabled bodies have been mistreated and misrepresented for entertainment purposes since the birth of cinema, as freakish spectacles to be ridiculed, mocked, feared and/or pitied. While contemporary representations are orientated towards more socially just and sympathetic treatments, the disabled body primarily remains a cultural signifier of tragedy, pity, undesirability, passivity and dependence. The thesis contends that these enduring stereotypes are made to appear as though they are a ‘natural’ product of impaired sexed bodies. A counter-discourse challenging ableism and sexism is silenced within these cinematic scripts. The research involves a discursive analysis of five films to reveal what I call a stylised silence. To identify a silent style, the thesis engages with Aristotle’s work on the rhetorical function of enthymemes within speech acts, along with its modern application to visual images. The main framework for this thesis employs feminist disability studies, however the project includes consideration of film studies. Thus, the discursive analysis incorporates the artistic elements of film—encompassing the mise-en-scène in combination with the narrative script. Applying a feminist intersectional approach, the study considers representations of disability at the intersection of gender, sexuality, race and class. The category of disability is itself diverse and the selected films encompass a range of disabilities. The film’s analysed are: My Own Love Song (2010); The Intouchables (2011); Morgan (2012); Still Alice (2015) and The Theory of Everything (2015). The conceptual and methodological approach is outlined in the first chapter. The second chapter introduces the various perspectives, debates and approaches within disability film scholarship that has included gender. Chapter three identifies the unspoken/silent ideology produced at the intersections of disability/gender/race, within one film’s fictional depiction of an African American man with schizophrenia and a white woman with a spinal cord injury. Chapter four engages with humour theories to examine the gendered silent production of ableist, racist and homophobic humour, within an interracial buddy/bromance comedy. Chapter five analyses the depiction of a recently disabled gay man, within a queer film festival production. The chapter observes how the film contains an unspoken/silent ideology of compulsory able-bodiedness. Chapter six analyses the gendered representation of Alzheimer’s disease. The analysis identifies a silent discursive formation, which produces complex and nuanced meanings about selfhood. Chapter seven engages with Simone de Beauvoir’s concept of gendered transcendence/immanence. The analysis locates and critiques the silent production of the disembodied professor, within a filmic representation of Professor Stephen Hawking. The final chapter applies Judith Butler’s theory of gender performativity to these findings. Overall, the study identifies a repeated silent discursive style which reflects and produces gendered ableist ideology. The thesis posits that silence is performative because an iterative silent discursive style produces the illusion that gendered disabilities constitute an abiding tragedy and undesirability. Bringing these unspoken discourses out of the projected silence and into linguistic life offers a way for subjects to speak back to these gendered/ableist cinematic sites of power.\n\nThis chapter discusses the intersecting relationships of feminist phenomenologies, queer phenomenologies, and phenomenologies of disability and race, in three contemporary examples of moving image work centrally featuring individuals or characters with lived experiences of disability. While each of these phenomenological modes puts forward substantively different methodologies, their common ground is found through a critique of the normative boundaries of the body as constituted by the white, male, able-bodied subject of philosophical and political discourse. Broadly speaking, their aims are also to create alternative visions of what these non-normativised subjectivities might be. Phenomenologies extend far beyond the field of philosophy: examples of phenomenological praxis are also found in cultural studies, visual cultures, anthropology, the medical humanities, and, of course, film. The epistemological claims of feminist phenomenologies are therefore necessarily interdisciplinary. Not only this: I argue that feminist phenomenologies 'inform' the study of film no more and no less than the study of film informs the development of feminist phenomenologies. No one single relationship, identity or definition can designate the ways in which feminist phenomenologies contribute to ongoing intellectual conversations about the place of bodies and embodied experience in the world; the means by which these experiences and bodies are performed and represented in the world, through film, constitutes a vital dynamic in the development of feminist phenomenologies.\n\nHow does it feel to lack something that everyone else has? How does it feel not being able to do something that everyone else can do? This difference, felt by the disabled or differently-abled is more likely the desperation out of discrimination. The concept of equality here often equates to preferences, but preferences are not solutions; they are merely support mechanisms in social dynamics. The labelling of the disabled as unique or special is not optimistic in the truest sense, but shaping their minds to feel so is. The primary support system for one is the family; however, when circumstances become extreme and unbearable, they can shatter familial stability, disintegrating it into a dysfunctional entity. This research paper is a detailed study of the two American plays, The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams and Long Day's Journey Into Night by Eugene O'Neill. It examines and interprets the intersection between disability and dysfunction and their role in the familial crisis in light of societal norms and expectations. Parallel to the literary world, the paper also discusses the perspective of viewing disability as art and conceptualizing addiction as a disability in the real world from a practical and policy-oriented perspective."
