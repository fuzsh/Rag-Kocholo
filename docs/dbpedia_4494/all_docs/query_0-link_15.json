        "text": "[Editor’s Note: This week, we relaunched our monthly Bookmarks feature with a five-part series on 100 essential books by Iranian writers available in English, researched and curated by author and translator Niloufar Talebi. Read the introductory essay to the series and the first list of books here. Today, in our final installment, we turn to a feast of fiction.]\n\n◻︎◻︎◻︎\n\n68. Man of My Time by Dalia Sofer (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2020)\n\nSet in Iran and New York City, Man of My Time tells the story of Hamid Mozaffarian, who after decades of ambivalent work as an interrogator with the Iranian regime, travels on a diplomatic mission to New York, where he encounters his estranged family and retrieves the ashes of his father, whose dying wish was to be buried in Iran. This is a novel not only about family and memory but about the interdependence of captor and captive, of citizen and country. Sofer is also the author of Septembers of Shiraz, which was made into a major motion picture.\n\n69. My Part of Her by Javad Djavahery, translated from the French by Emma Ramadan (Restless Books, 2020)\n\nIn Djavahery’s captivating English debut, a youthful betrayal during a summer on the Caspian sea has far-reaching consequences for a group of friends as their lives are irrevocably altered by the Revolution. Urgent and gorgeously written, My Part of Her captures the innocence of youth, and the capriciousness of fate as these friends find themselves on opposing sides of the seismic rifts of history.\n\n70. The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Shokoofeh Azar, translated from the Persian by Anonymous (Europa Editions, Reprint edition, 2020)\n\nThis extraordinary novel is not about external alienation, but about internal exile. Written (and translated) beautifully, this is a story of a family destroyed by the revolution even if it insulates itself in a distant village. It is a story of modernity clashing with tradition, a juxtaposition that generates all manners of supernatural beings among the characters. The novel is full of ghosts—of immediate family members, of ancestors, of shamans. The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree was shortlisted for the 2020 International Booker Prize. As of the release of this list, it was longlisted for the 2020 National Book Award for Translated Literature.\n\n71. Out of Mesopotamia by Salar Abdoh (Akashic Books, 2020)\n\n“In this swift, hard-boiled novel…shadowy zealots exist everywhere, whether in conference rooms or interrogation rooms or—most often—in rooms that can serve as both.” (New York Times Book Review). Abdoh is also the author of Tehran at Twilight, The Poet’s Game, Opium, and editor of Tehran Noir, a selection of crime stories by more than 15 writers, and named a Notable Translation of 2014 by World Literature Today. He also co-wrote the play, Quotations from a Ruined City, with his older brother, Reza Abdoh, the world famous avant-garde theater director.\n\n72. A Door Between Us by Ehsaneh Sadr (Blackstone Publishing, 2020)\n\nA scholar and activist who has worked on campaigns ranging from Iran human rights to biking advocacy, Ehsaneh Sadr turned her fictional eye to the 2009 Iranian green movement in A Door Between Us. Having spent time between Iran and the United States, she tells the story of a young couple whose families fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum. The daughter of a Mormon American mother and a Muslim Iranian father, she considers many places home.\n\nAnother work set around the 2009 green movement is the graphic work, Zahra’s Paradise, by Amir and Khalil (First Second, 2011). A New York Times bestseller and a Publishers Weekly Best Comics title for 2011, Zahra’s Paradise is the story of the search for Mehdi, a young protestor who has vanished into an extrajudicial twilight zone. What’s keeping his memory from being obliterated is not the law. It is the grit and guts of his mother, who refuses to surrender her son to fate, and the tenacity of his brother, a blogger, who fuses tradition and technology to explore and explode the void in which Mehdi has vanished.\n\n73. Death in Her Hands by Ottessa Moshfegh (Penguin Press, 2020)\n\nWhile on her daily walk with her dog in secluded woods, a woman comes across a note, handwritten and carefully pinned to the ground by stones. “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.” But there is no dead body. Death in Her Hands was named one of the Best Books of Summer 2020 by New York Magazine, Time Magazine, Town & Country, Marie Claire, Refinery 29, PopSugar, the Today Show. Moshfegh is also the author of My Year of Rest and Relaxation (a New York Times bestseller), Eileen (shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Man Booker Prize, and won the PEN/Hemingway Award for debut fiction), and the short story collection, Homesick for Another World.\n\n74. Then the Fish Swallowed Him by Amir Ahmadi Arian (HarperVia, 2020)\n\nThen the Fish Swallowed Him is Amir Ahmadi Arian’s first novel in English. He previously published as a journalist and writer in Iran. This novel dives deep into the life and unraveling of Yunus, a non-political Tehran bus driver who is unexpectedly arrested and imprisoned after the 2005 bus union strikes. Then the Fish Swallowed Him brings to life the metaphor of Jonas who was sent to the solitary into the belly of the whale as the result of a perceived mistake.\n\n75. Aria: A Novel by Nazanine Hozar (Pantheon, 2020)\n\nThis debut novel is set in restless 1950s Iran, a country rich in oil but deeply divided by class and religion, and its government under foreign sway. An illiterate army driver discovers a baby abandoned in an alley and menaced by ravenous dogs. He takes her home and names her Aria. As a student, Arie is caught up in popular uprisings against the Shah. The novel’s heart-pounding, explosive finale sees Ayatollah Khomeini’s brutal regime seize power as Aria falls in love and becomes a mother herself.\n\n76. The Immortals of Tehran by Ali Araghi (Melville House Publishing, 2020)\n\nIn his debut book in English, Ali Araghi tells a multi-generational story of a family under a centuries-old curse which builds up to a climax at the 1979 revolution. Exploring the brutality of history while conjuring the astonishment of magical realism, The Immortals of Tehran is a novel about the incantatory power of words and the revolutionary sparks of love, family, and poetry—set against the indifferent, relentless march of time. Araghi is also a translator whose project, Persian, Translated, is slated to be a database of Persian literature translated into English.\n\n77. Call Me Zebra by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi (Mariner Books, 2019)\n\nLast in a line of anarchists, autodidacts, and atheists, Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi’s protagonist, Zebra, traces back her family’s migration pattern from Iran to the United States. On the way, the novel becomes a whirling reference library of books that made it all possible because “When war came, her family didn’t fight; they took refuge in books.” Call Me Zebra won the PEN/Faulkner award in 2019, along with a long list of other major prizes. Oloomi is also the founder of Literatures of Annihilation, Exile, and Resistance, a bi-annual symposia and lectures.\n\n78. The Drowned by Moniro Ravanipour, translated from the Persian by M. R. Ghanoonparvar (Independently published, 2019)\n\nThis first novel, Ahl-e Gharq, published a decade after the Islamic Revolution and a year after the devastating Iran-Iraq War ended, brought Ravanipour overnight recognition in Iran. In it, she draws from the rich culture of southwestern Iran, the region most affected by the war. Dr. Ganoonparvar has also translated Ravanipour’s volume of short stories, Kanizu, and These Crazy Nights, a novel born of Ravanipour’s experience of the Iran-Iraq war as a night nurse in a Tehran hospital. Ravanipour has independently published much of her original Persian work in the United States.\n\nGhanoonparvar is the translator of several other titles, including Horse’s Head by Jaafar Modarres-Sadeghi, Red Olive by Nahid Yousefian, Tales of Sabalan by Mohammad Reza Bayrami, Patient Stone by Sadeq Chubak, Doran by Ruhangiz Sharifian, Book of Jinn by Hushang Golshiri, all published by Mazda Publishers, a US-based press dedicated to Iranian literature.\n\nGhanoonparvar is also the author of Translating the Garden, in which he allows readers in on the process of translating Dialogue in the Garden from Persian into English. This short philosophical work uses a conversation between a writer and a painter to explore Persian perceptions of art, literature, nature, identity, and spirituality. Ghanoonparvar discusses the myriad decisions that a literary translator faces.\n\n79. The Woman Who Read Too Much, by Bahiyyih Nakhjavani (Redwood Press; 1st Edition, 2016)\n\nSet in the 19th century world of the Qajar monarchs, mayors, ministers, and mullahs, this book explores the dangerous and at the same time luminous legacy left by a remarkable person, the renowned poet, theologian, radical, and outcast, Tahereh Qurratu’l-Ayn, who was killed for rejecting the orthodoxy of her time. Nakhjavani offers a gripping tale that is at once a compelling history of a pioneering woman, a story of nineteenth century Iran told from the street level up, and a work that is universally relevant to our times. Nakhjavani grew up in Uganda, was educated in the United Kingdom and the United States, and now lives in France. She is also the author of The Saddlebag, US & Them, and Paper.\n\n80. To Keep the Sun Alive by Rabeah Ghaffari (Catapult, 2019)\n\nThis debut novel is a family story set in the months around the 1979 Iranian revolution and the events outside the family orchard. Told through a host of unforgettable characters, ranging from servants and young children to intimate friends, To Keep the Sun Alive reveals the human lives that animate historical events. An official ABA Indie Next List selection, A Big Other Most Anticipated Small Press Book of the Year, and a The Millions Most Anticipated Book of the Year. Ghaffari is also a filmmaker.\n\n81. Disoriental by Négar Djavadi, translated from the French by Tina Kover (Europa Editions; Translation edition, 2018)\n\nA National Book Award Finalist and winner of the 2019 Albertine Prize and Lambda Literary Award, Disoriental is the story of Kimiâ Sadr who fled Iran at the age of ten with her mother and sisters to join her father in France. In the waiting room of a Parisian fertility clinic, generations of flamboyant Sadrs return to her, including her formidable great-grandfather with his harem of fifty-two wives, and her parents, stalwart opponents of each regime that befalls them. It is Kimiâ herself―punk-rock aficionado, storyteller extraordinaire, and above all a modern woman divided between family traditions and her own “disorientalization”―who forms the heart of this bestselling and beloved novel.\n\n82. Better than War: Stories by Siamak Vossoughi (University of Georgia Press, 2018)\n\nThe stories in Better Than War encompass narratives from a diverse set of Iranian immigrants, many searching for a balance between memories of their homeland and their new American culture. The everyday life of each character subtly reflects viewpoints that are simultaneously Iranian and American, of all ages and circumstances. All Iranian immigrants, young or old, carry with them a vivid past in their present lives. Vossoughi’s Better Than War is about growing up, coming of age, and raising children in America while still remembering the importance of retaining an Iranian identity.\n\n83. Song of a Captive Bird by Jasmin Darznik (Ballantine Books, 2018)\n\nA Los Angeles Times Bestseller, this debut novel captures the tenacity, spirit, and conflicting desires of the trailblazing Iranian poet Forugh Farrokhzad who represents the birth of modern feminism in Iran—and who continues to inspire generations of women, poets, and artists around the world. The novel is inspired by Farrokhzad’s poetry, letters, films, and interviews—and includes excerpts of Farrokhzad’s original poems in translation. Darznik is also the author of the memoir, The Good Daughter: A Memoir of My Mother’s Hidden Life, and the upcoming historical novel set in the 1920’s, The Bohemians (2021).\n\n84. A Good Country by Laleh Khadivi (Bloomsbury USA, 2017)\n\nThis third book in Khadivi’s Kurdish trilogy—following The Walking, and The Age of Orphans—tells the story of Rez, a Muslim-American teen who goes from stoner Laguna Beach highschool student to radicalized youth. Timely, nuanced, and emotionally forceful, A Good Country is a gorgeous meditation on modern life and of being caught among vastly different worlds. What we are left with at the dramatic end is not an assessment of good or evil, East versus West, but a lingering question that applies to all modern souls: Do we decide how to live, or is our life decided for us? Khadivi is also a documentary filmmaker.\n\n85. Savushun: A Novel About Modern Iran by Simin Daneshvar, translated from the Persian by M. R. Ghanoonparvar (Mage Publishers, 3rd edition, 2017)\n\nSavushun was the first published novel by an Iranian woman, and one of the most widely read novels in Iran. Daneshvar was a novelist, translator, and academic educated in Iran, later studying creative writing with Wallace Stegner at Stanford University through a Fulbright scholarship. The 1966 novel begins on the eve of World War II, as two landholder brothers react in opposite ways to the British request for their grain harvests. We experience the power struggle through the eyes and ears of one of their wives, the protagonist Zari. One brother refuses to sell his grain out from under his people to feed a foreign army. The other seeks personal gain by accepting British policies and their determination to keep Iran’s oil out of Hitler’s control, as he tries to persuade his brother to sell. Zari believes she must be the family peacemaker. An earlier English translation of the book is available as A Persian Requiem, translated from the Persian by Roxane Zand, (George Braziller, 1992). Two collections of Daneshvar’s short stories, Daneshvar’s Playhouse (bilingual, tr. by Maryam Mafi), and Sutra and Other Stories (tr. by Hasan Javadi and Amin Neshati), are also available in English translation, both by Mage Publishers.\n\n86. The Blind Owl and Other Stories by Sadegh Hedayat, translated from the Persian by D.P. Costello and Deborah Miller Mostaghel (Calder Publications, 2017)\n\nSadegh Hedayat was a foremost Iranian writer, translator and intellectual. This edition includes the original Costello translation of Hedayat’s major work of literary modernism, (Buf-e Kur, 1937), The Blind Owl in English, (first published by John Calder in 1957), as well as a selection of short stories from Hedayat’s other notable works, Three Drops of Blood, The Stray Dog, and Buried Alive, in Mostaghel’s translation. Hedayat’s translations into the Persian include the works of Chekhov, Kafka, Schnitzler, and Sartre. The Blind Owl is a fever dream of an unnamed pen case painter, the narrator, making confessions to the shadow on his wall that is in the shape of an owl. It was written during the oppressive years of Reza Shah’s rule, and originally published in a limited edition in Bombay, during Hedayat’s two-year-long stay there, stamped with “Not for sale or publication in Iran.” It first appeared in Tehran in 1941 as a serial in the daily Iran after Reza Shah’s abdication, to immediate acclaim. The Blind Owl has been translated into numerous languages, and adapted by several filmmakers.
