        "text": "Academy Award winner Adrien Brody and Salma Hayek lead this stunning adaptation of Dalia Sofer’s critically acclaimed novel. Amidst the turmoil of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Isaac (Brody), a secular Jew, is brutally interrogated on baseless charges of being an Israeli spy. Against the rising tide of fear, Isaac’s wife Farnez (Hayek) strives for his release and to escape the stranglehold of repression. A gripping drama and a profound look at ordinary lives crushed under the march of history.\n\nPlease note that this film contains scenes of violence"
