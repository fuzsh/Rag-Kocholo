        "text": "Senor Macho Solo\n\nJenna (Jane Krakowski) is concerned that Lizâs (Tina Fey) attraction to a new guy (guest star Peter Dinklage) has to do with her longing to have a child. Jack (Alec Baldwin) is keeping busy as he helps Tracy and wife Angie (guest star Sherri Shepherd) arrange a \"post-nup,\" and tries to get Jenna an audition for the title role in a Janis Joplin biopic. Plus, he finds time to hit it off with his motherâs nurse, Elisa (guest star Salma Hayek). Also starring Jack McBrayer, Judah Friedlander and Scott Adsit.\n\nFlu Shot\n\nLiz (Tina Fey) tries desperately not to catch the flu, but itÂs spreading amongst the ÂTGSÂ cast and crew quickly and Jack (Alec Baldwin) is being selective about who receives vaccinations from Dr. Spaceman (guest star Chris Parnell). One is offered to Liz, but she refuses to take it, championing for the rights of the crew. Meanwhile, Elisa (guest star Salma Hayek) is working seven days a week, so Jack must be creative about finding ways to spend time with her. Also stars Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, Katrina Bowden and Scott Adsit.\n\nGeneralissimo\n\nLiz (Tina Fey) discovers she has a handsome and newly single neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), she'Âd like to meet after receiving his mail by mistake. However, in true Liz fashion their chance at getting to know one another doesn'Ât begin so well. Due to Jack'Âs (Alec Baldwin) striking resemblance to a Spanish soap villain, Elisa'Âs (Salma Hayek) grandmother disapproves of their relationship. Jack is determined to do whatever it takes to win her adoration. Back at 30 Rock, the new \"TGS\" interns invite Tracy (Tracy Morgan) out for a night of partying; but Tracy, unwilling to admit it, cannot seem to keep up with the former Wall Street frat boys. Also starring Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer.\n\nSt. Valentine's Day\n\nNot realizing itÂs going to be the ultimate lovers holiday, Liz (Tina Fey) insists her and Drew (Jon Hamm) have their first official date on Valentine'Âs Day; while Jack (Alec Baldwin) prepares himself for an unconventional ValentineÂs Day spent at church with girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek). Tracy (Tracy Morgan) tries to help Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) win the affections of a new staffer. Also starring Jane Krakowski and Judah Friedlander\n\nLarry King\n\nJack (Alec Baldwin) considers taking the next step with Elisa (Salma Hayek), but will he be able to choose between his commitment to her and his demanding career? Meanwhile, Tracyâs (Tracy Morgan) interview on \"Larry King Live\" sends New York City into a panic. Out in the chaotic city, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) recruits Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) to venture out to Queens to retrieve her lost cell phone from a surly cabbie. Also starring Jane Krakowski, Judah Friedlander and Scott Adsit."
