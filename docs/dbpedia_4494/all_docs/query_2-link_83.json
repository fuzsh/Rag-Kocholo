        "text": "The movie world spotlight shifts north of the border today with the kickoff of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival kicks. Here are five things to know about the latest edition of the cinema celebration.\n\nThe opening film\n\nQuebec filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée landed TIFF's coveted opening gala slot with Demolition, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts and Chris Cooper.\n\nBilled as an offbeat but heartfelt film, Demolition revolves around an investment banker (Gyllenhaal) struggling to rebuild his life after the sudden death of his wife. The comedy-drama is a prime example of a recurring theme at TIFF in recent years:in-demand Canadian filmmakers making high-profile films with Hollywood A-listers.\n\nTIFF 2015 to open with Jake Gyllenhaal in Jean-Marc Vallée's Demolition\n\nTIFF 2015: Julianne Moore, Benedict Cumberbatch among stars expected\n\nA history of TIFF opening nights\n\nVallée earned widespread accolades and Oscar nominations for his 2013 film, the Matthew McConaughey-led Dallas Buyers Club. His reputation improved further with his follow-up, 2014's Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon.\n\nGyllenhaal has previously starred in two films for another Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve: 2013's Prisoners and Enemy.\n\nStar spotting\n\nTIFF has come a long way since Henry (The Fonz) Winkler was the biggest star to grace the red carpet (way back in 1977).\n\nCelebrated moviemakers and stars from around the globe are touching down in Toronto this year.\n\nHere's just a taste of the celeb-packed guest list: Julianne Moore, Ellen Page, Christopher Plummer, Arcade Fire, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Salma Hayek, Eddie Redmayne, Natalie Portman, Drew Barrymore, Penelope Cruz, Ridley Scott, Yo Yo Ma, Irrfan Khan, Elisabeth Moss, Idris Elba, Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart, Sarah Silverman, Gael Garcial Bernal, Nanni Moretti, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Moore, Deepa Mehta, Michael Nyqvist, Dev Patel, Geoffrey Rush and Donald, Kiefer and Rossif Sutherland.\n\nWhat's the buzz?\n\nMovie buzz can build or vanish in an instant, but for the moment, must-see chatter is centred on several titles and key performances, including:\n\nAn almost unrecognizable Johnny Depp in the gangster story Black Mass.\n\nThe Oscar-pedigreed 1920s-era transgender tale The Danish Girl.\n\nAstronaut-approved 3D space tale The Martian (starring Matt Damon).\n\nCaptivity saga Room, based on Canadian Emma Donoghue's bestselling novel.\n\nA feast of film\n\nAltogether, festival organizers have programmed a massive 2015 lineup, with 399 films (including features and shorts) from 71 countries to unspool on Toronto's movie screens.\n\nVIDEO | TIFF's Cameron Bailey shares his highlights for this year's 40th anniversary\n\nTIFF 2015: Why there's no Canadian-themed program\n\n​​20 things to know about TIFF 2015\n\nFestival on the street\n\nFor TIFF's perennially whirlwind first weekend (Sept. 10-13), organizers will once again take over several blocks of prime downtown Toronto real estate around its Lightbox headquarters for a sprawling, free, pedestrian-only celebration."
