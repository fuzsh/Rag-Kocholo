If the script of “Septembers of Shiraz” looked anything like the film sounds, each sentence would be printed in bold, increased to an extra-large font and thrice underlined. At least that’s how most scenes play out in this well-meaning yet nuance-free film.

The story, adapted by Hanna Weg from a novel by Dalia Sofer, centers on Isaac (Adrien Brody), an Iranian Jew, and his wife, Farnaz (Salma Hayek-Pinault). It’s 1979 in Iran, and this prosperous and friendly couple are targeted for harassment as the revolution arrives. Isaac is later arrested and tortured while Farnaz struggles to hold the family together. Before long, they plan an escape from the country.

Both of the lead actors, and Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Habibeh, a housekeeper, try to offer up some subtlety; the unsteady bond between Farnaz and Habibeh even introduces an idea or two about the difficulties of employer-employee friendships and the gulf separating the rich and the poor.

But those scenes aside, the script almost always inserts a speech where a shrug or a smile would do better, and that’s before the intrusive and persistent score telegraphs every emotion it thinks you should be feeling. “They’re coming after us!” Farnaz declares at one point, as we watch the bad guys do just that. Cue the pursuit music.
