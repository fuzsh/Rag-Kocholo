BUBBLE CAVITATION How to derive Keller-Miksis formula from Rayleigh-Plesset equation? Rayleigh-Plesset equation[edit] The theory of bubble dynamics was started in 1917 by Lord Rayleigh during his work with the Royal Navy to investigate cavitation damage on ship propellers. Over several decades, his work was refined and developed by Milton Plesset, Andrea Prosperetti, and others. The Rayleigh-Plesset equation is: R'' + (3/2)(R')^2 - (2/R) = (1/Ï)(p' - pâˆž) + (3/2)(Ïƒ/R) - (4Î¼/R)R' where R is the bubble radius, R' is the first order derivative of the bubble radius with respect to time, R'' is the second order derivative of the bubble radius with respect to time, Ï is the density of the liquid, p' is the pressure inside the bubble, pâˆž is the pressure at infinity, Ïƒ is the surface tension of the gas-liquid interface, and Î¼ is the viscosity of the liquid. Keller-Miksis formulation[edit] The Keller-Miksis formulation is an equation derived for the large, radial oscillations of a bubble trapped in a sound field. When the frequency of the sound field approaches the natural frequency of the bubble, it will result in large amplitude oscillations. The Keller-Miksis equation takes into account the viscosity, surface tension, incident sound wave, and acoustic radiation coming from the bubble, which was previously unaccounted for in Lauterborn's calculations. Lauterborn solved the equation that Plesset, et al. modified from: R'' + (3/2)(R')^2 - (2/R) = (1/Ï)(p' - pâˆž) + (3/2)(Ïƒ/R) - (4Î¼/R)R' where R is the radius of the bubble, the dots indicate first and second time derivatives, p is the density of the liquid, c is the speed of sound through the liquid, and pR,t is the pressure at the bubble surface.
