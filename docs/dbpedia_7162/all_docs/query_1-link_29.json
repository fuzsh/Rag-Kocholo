        "text": "EEG is the most commonly used method for predicting neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest (CA).1 Within seconds of circulatory arrest, the EEG becomes suppressed and after return of circulation, if recovery occurs, neuronal activity progresses gradually from a suppressed to a more continuous background.2,3 The specific time point of EEG examination is therefore considered crucial for its prognostic relevance. An early recovery of a continuous and normal voltage background within the first 12–24 hours is associated with good neurologic outcome.4-6\n\nA classification of EEG patterns into benign, malignant, and highly malignant was proposed based on the terminology from the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS).7,8 This classification concerns routine EEGs obtained after the first 36 hours postarrest. It has been externally validated and found to predict neurologic outcome after CA with high specificity and substantial interrater reliability.4,9,10 Two background patterns are considered highly malignant; suppression (all EEG activity <10 μV) and burst-suppression (suppression periods alternate with bursts of cortical activity).7,10 Either of these background patterns ≥24 hours after CA, regardless of the presence of discharges, is considered a strong predictor of poor neurologic outcome according to recent guidelines.11,12\n\nThe presence of abundant rhythmic/periodic discharges is considered a criterion of a malignant EEG and outcome is often poor.7,10 Discharges may reflect severe ischemic damage and antiepileptic treatment might not improve outcome.13 In a number of patients, however, neuronal injury is less extensive and anticonvulsant treatment may be beneficial.14\n\nStudies for prediction of neurologic outcome often permit clinical decision-making based on the results from the same examinations, and the risk of self-fulfilling prophecies cannot be excluded. In contrast, highly sensitive blood biomarkers for brain injury have been used as surrogate markers in clinical studies.15,16 Brain injury markers have the advantage of being objective and quantitative indicators, especially if not available upon clinical decision-making. The most accurate blood biomarker of brain injury after CA described to date is the neuroaxonal injury marker neurofilament light (NfL), which is superior to S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and tau.17,18 Analysis of NfL is not standardized nor do validated cutoff values exist for its use in neuroprognostication after CA. Nonetheless, using an early quantitative measure such as NfL levels as a surrogate marker for neuroaxonal injury could give unique insights into whether EEG abnormality is directly associated with brain injury and not only neurologic outcome, which may be biased by self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nWe hypothesized that the hierarchy of benign, malignant, and highly malignant EEG patterns is reflected by increasing NfL levels as a measure of acute brain injury after CA. We further explored associations between NfL and 2 fundamental elements of the EEG: background and superimposed discharges. Based on the prognostic accuracies of the highly malignant pattern to predict poor outcome after CA, we hypothesized that the EEG background is more strongly associated with brain injury than EEG discharges.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe confirmed that the standardized classification of post-CA EEGs into benign, malignant, and highly malignant patterns7 is reflected by increasing NfL concentrations, indicating the degree of neuroaxonal injury. EEG background and electrographic discharges at 36 hours or later postarrest were independently associated with blood NfL levels, where the background had the stronger association with NfL.\n\nThe highly malignant EEG pattern, which includes any background with ≥50% suppression, has very high specificity for prediction of poor neurologic outcome.11 Substantially elevated NfL levels in most of these patients quantitatively confirm that highly malignant backgrounds are indeed associated with extensive neuroaxonal injury.7,10\n\nBenign EEG patterns ≥36 hours postarrest indicate a good prognosis, whereas malignant EEG patterns represent an intermediate group with both good and poor clinical outcomes.7,10,11 In common with other classifications of EEG patterns, the classification that we used includes combinations of background patterns and superimposed discharges. To better understand which elements are more related to the extent of neuronal injury, we chose to evaluate EEG background and discharges separately.\n\nBackground activity was divided into 4 groups according to the amount of suppression periods. We did not detect any difference in NfL levels between suppressed and burst-suppression backgrounds. Both backgrounds could have different pathophysiologic correlates but demonstrate similar degrees of neuroaxonal injury, where a suppressed background may indicate severe functional damage to pyramidal cells or interneurons and burst-suppression a severely damaged cortex with less affected subcortical areas.29-31 A histopathologic study found severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in 96% of patients with suppression or burst-suppression backgrounds.29 On a group level, suppression of EEG background through sedatives has not been found to influence the reliability of poor outcome prediction; nonetheless, false-positive cases have been reported.7,10,32 In our cohort, 1 patient had a good outcome despite a burst-suppression background, presumably due to ongoing significant sedation, as previously reported.10 The peak NfL concentration in this patient was within age-dependent normal values of our laboratory, illustrating how the combination of EEG and a quantitative biomarker may reduce the risk of falsely pessimistic predictions.33\n\nIn patients with a discontinuous background, we found a broad range of NfL levels, indicating that an isolated finding of a discontinuous background does not reliably indicate severe brain injury. This is in accordance with the 2021 guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine stating that a discontinuous background has low prognostic performance within the first 24 hours postarrest and inconsistent performance thereafter.12\n\nThe lowest NfL levels in our cohort were found in patients with a continuous EEG background. However, there were also a substantial amount of patients with poor outcome with highly elevated levels of NfL in this group. An early return of a continuous background within the first 12–24 hours postarrest is often predictive of a good neurologic outcome.34,35 In analogy with brainstem reflexes, a continuous background may recover later than 24 hours postarrest despite extensive brain injury and is therefore not automatically predictive of good outcome.4,23 At relatively long latency after arrest, this pattern could still be associated with severe histopathologic brain damage.29 Whether the patients in our cohort restored a continuous background late cannot be determined, as continuous EEG monitoring was not used. We hypothesize that this may have been the case in patients with poor outcome with severely elevated NfL levels. Furthermore, a continuous background can also display malignant features such as a reversed anterio-posterior gradient.7\n\nThe presence of abundant discharges (>50% of the recording) is also a criterion for a malignant EEG and indicates a poor prognosis.7,10 We found that when evaluating discharges irrespective of EEG background, patients with an abundant load had higher median NfL concentrations than patients without discharges. The group of patients with an intermediate amount of discharges did not differ in NfL levels compared with the other 2 groups. In another substudy from the TTM-trial using continuous EEG monitoring with a reduced montage, NfL levels were elevated at 72 hours postarrest in patients with electrographic status epilepticus compared with patients without.36 Another study compared EEG and NSE and found no difference in levels between patients with or without discharges, possibly due to lack of separation between different amounts of discharges.37 Electrographic discharges are considered a sign of increased excitatory activity of the pyramidal cells due to the loss of inhibitory interneurons, caused by either severe encephalopathy or injury to specific brain areas only.38 On neuroimaging, discharges can be associated with both cortical and subcortical lesions, but MRI was reported as normal in 20% of patients with generalized periodic discharges.39 In a proposed model, a 5% reduction in cortical disinhibition was sufficient to induce generalized periodic discharges.40 Whether normal EEG patterns can be reestablished may depend on the extent of injury to cortical networks and reversibility of synaptic failure.38 It is unclear whether discharges induce additional injury through excitotoxicity or if they are solely the result of the hypoxic-ischemic injury caused by the arrest.11\n\nDischarges on a burst-suppression or suppressed background were not associated with a change in NfL levels in our study. A recent study with 7 patients also described higher NfL levels in patients with a suppressed background than in patients with generalized periodic discharges.41 A small histopathologic study reported similar findings.29 This supports the assumption that neurons unable to produce either background activity or discharges are more injured than neurons generating them.\n\nIn our study, NfL levels did not differ whether discharges were present or not on a discontinuous background. Nonetheless, no patient with a discontinuous background survived to 6-month follow-up if discharges were present and NfL levels in patients with this combination were high.\n\nIn cases with a continuous background, NfL was higher in those with discharges than without. Our data imply that discharges may only provide additional prognostic information when superimposed on a continuous or discontinuous background and that they are not necessarily associated with poor outcome. Previous studies after CA report that in patients with good outcome, status epilepticus evolved from a continuous background.13,42 The design of our study cannot confirm whether discharges cause further NfL elevation in addition to the primary hypoxic-ischemic injury. Further research is required to identify those patients where anticonvulsant treatment may improve outcome and repeated NfL sampling at later time points could be valuable. We recently reported that low levels of brain injury markers are predictors of a favorable neurologic outcome, indicating that EEG patterns and biomarkers together may help guide clinical decision-making.43\n\nStrengths of our study include the international multicenter design, a conservative approach to neurologic prognostication, and strict criteria for WLST.19,44 As previously published, serum samples were prospectively collected from all patients at sites participating in the biobank substudy and the number of missing samples was low.17 In contrast to the guideline-recommended biomarker NSE, which is also present in erythrocytes and neuroendocrine tumors, NfL levels are not falsely elevated in the presence of hemolysis.17,27\n\nThe TTM-trial included adult patients with a presumed cardiac cause of arrest, and because we evaluated the extent of brain injury, we suspect that results would be similar in patients with anoxic brain injuries due to other causes. However, our results should be validated in a broader CA population.\n\nAlthough EEGs were mandatory in the TTM-trial, examinations were still subject to selection bias, because patients awake or dead prior to the time point of prognostication were excluded from this study. Our patient population had a higher rate of poor outcome than the patients who were excluded, as patients who awoke prior to examination were excluded.7,10 We do not consider this a limitation because neurologic prognostication is only relevant in this group of comatose patients.\n\nSmall sample sizes in some subgroups resulted in limited power in subgroup analyses, which may be regarded as hypothesis-generating. The cohort included in this study was previously evaluated when validating highly malignant patterns as reported previously.7,10 EEG reactivity was not included in this study as not all collaborating sites performed reactivity testing. The ACNS criteria have been updated after the analysis performed in this study.45 However, ACNS definitions used in our study have undergone only minor changes, which we consider insignificant for the interpretation of our results.\n\nThe EEGs were performed >36 hours postarrest and we assume that our results could differ in EEGs performed earlier. Our findings need to be validated for EEGs performed <36 hours postarrest. We cannot exclude that patients had electrographic seizures, potentially affecting NfL levels, not detected by routine EEG, which might have been detected with continuous EEG monitoring. The rate of patients with ongoing antiseizure medication was higher with increasing amounts of discharges on the EEG. Nonetheless, 16% of patients without electrographic discharges were also treated with anticonvulsant drugs and 39% of patients had ongoing sedation during the EEG recording. It is possible that if left untreated, some patients would otherwise have demonstrated electrographic discharges, which may have influenced our results. We previously reported that the prognostic ability of EEG on the group level in the TTM-trial cohort was not significantly affected by ongoing sedation, but acknowledge that individual false-positive cases may occur; for instance, the good outcome patient with burst-suppression during significant sedation described above.7,10\n\nThe only prespecified EEG criterion allowing WLST in the TTM-trial was a therapy-refractory status epilepticus ≥108 hours postarrest.19,44 Results of local EEG reviews were available to treating physicians and therefore we cannot exclude the risk of a self-fulfilling prophecy on neurologic outcome. In contrast, NfL was analyzed after trial completion, thus levels were not available upon clinical decision-making, minimizing risk for bias. NfL has been validated for clinical use in some European countries but is not yet widely clinically available and there is no reference standard or international normal reference limit for serum NfL.46\n\nEEG patterns >36 hours after cardiac arrest reflect the extent of brain injury as measured by NfL in serum. The EEG background is more strongly related to the extent of brain injury compared with superimposed discharges. A clinical scenario with unexpected combinations of high NfL levels with a continuous EEG pattern >36 hours could help identify patients with potentially poor outcome, and low NfL levels in patients with malignant or highly malignant patterns could help identify patients with potentially favorable outcome."
