        "text": "Correlation between Gas Bubble Formation and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics at Nanoelectrodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Qianjin; Luo, Long\n\n2018-04-17\n\nWe report the correlation between H 2 gas bubble formation potential and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity for Au and Pt nanodisk electrodes (NEs). Microkinetic models were formulated to obtain the HER kinetic information for individual Au and Pt NEs. We found that the rate-determining steps for the HER at Au and Pt NEs were the Volmer step and the Heyrovsky step, respectively. More interestingly, the standard rate constant ( k 0 ) of the rate-determining step was found to vary over 2 orders of magnitude for the same type of NEs. The observed variations indicate the HER activity heterogeneity at the nanoscale. Furthermore, we discovered a linear relationship between bubble formation potential ( E bubble ) and log( k 0 ) with a slope of 125 mV/decade for both Au and Pt NEs. As log ( k 0 ) increases, E bubble shifts linearly to more positive potentials, meaning NEs with higher HER activities form H 2 bubbles at less negative potentials. Our theoretical model suggests that such linear relationship is caused by the similar critical bubble formation condition for Au and Pt NEs with varied sizes. Our results have potential implications for using gas bubble formation to evaluate the HER activity distribution of nanoparticles in an ensemble.\n\nTransformer overload and bubble evolution: Proceedings\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAddis, G.; Lindgren, S.\n\n1988-06-01\n\nThe EPRI workshop on Transformer Overload Characteristics and Bubble Evolution was held to review the findings of investigations over the past 7-8 years to determine whether enough information is now available for utilities to establish safe loading practices. Sixteen papers were presented, including a utility review, physical and dielectric effects of gas and bubble formation from cellulose insulated transformers, transformer life characteristics, gas bubble studies and impulse test on distribution transformers, mathematical modeling of bubble evolution, transformer overload characteristics, variation of PD-strength for oil-paper insulation, survey on maximum safe operating hot spot temperature, and overload management. The meeting concluded withmoreÂ Â» a general discussion covering the existing state of knowledge and the need for additional research.

In the final stage of the evolution, before detachment, there is an enhancement of mass transfer, which changes from diffusion to natural convection. Once the bubble detaches, it leaves behind a gas-depleted area. The diffusive mass transfer towards that region cannot compensate for the amount of gas which is taken away by the bubble. Consequently, the consecutive bubble will grow in an environment which contains less gas than for the previous one. This reduces the local supersaturation of the mixture around the nucleation site, leading to a reduced bubble growth rate. We present quantitative experimental data on this effect and the theoretical model for depletion during the bubble growth rate. This work was supported by the Netherlands Center for Multiscale Catalytic Energy Conversion (MCEC), an NWO Gravitation programme funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science of the government of the Netherlands.\n\nDesulfurization kinetics of molten copper by gas bubbling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFukunaka, Y.; Nishikawa, K.; Sohn, H. S.; Asaki, Z.\n\n1991-02-01\n\nMolten copper with 0.74 wt pct sulfur content was desulfurized at 1523 K by bubbling Ar-O2 gas through a submerged nozzle. The reaction rate was significantly influenced not only by the oxygen partial pressure but also by the gas flow rate. Little evolution of SO2 gas was observed in the initial 10 seconds of the oxidation; however, this was followed by a period of high evolution rate of SO2 gas. The partial pressure of SO2 gas decreased with further progress of the desulfurization. The effect of the immersion depth of the submerged nozzle was negligible. The overall reaction is decomposed to two elementary reactions: the desulfurization and the dissolution rate of oxygen. The assumptions were made that these reactions are at equilibrium and that the reaction rates are controlled by mass transfer rates within and around the gas bubble. The time variations of sulfur and oxygen contents in the melt and the SO2 partial pressure in the off-gas under various bubbling conditions were well explained by the mathematical model combined with the reported thermodynamic data of these reactions. Based on the present model, it was anticipated that the oxidation rate around a single gas bubble was mainly determined by the rate of gas-phase mass transfer, but all oxygen gas blown into the melt was virtually consumed to the desulfurization and dissolution reactions before it escaped from the melt surface.\n\nMorphological bubble evolution induced by air diffusion on submerged hydrophobic structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLv, Pengyu; Xiang, Yaolei; Xue, Yahui; Lin, Hao; Duan, Huiling\n\n2017-03-01\n\nBubbles trapped in the cavities always play important roles in the underwater applications of structured hydrophobic surfaces. Air exchange between bubbles and surrounding water has a significant influence on the morphological bubble evolution, which in turn frequently affects the functionalities of the surfaces, such as superhydrophobicity and drag reduction. In this paper, air diffusion induced bubble evolution on submerged hydrophobic micropores under reduced pressures is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The morphological behaviors of collective and single bubbles are observed using confocal microscopy. Four representative evolution phases of bubbles are captured in situ. After depressurization, bubbles will not only grow and coalesce but also shrink and split although the applied pressure remains negative. A diffusion-based model is used to analyze the evolution behavior and the results are consistent with the experimental data. A criterion for bubble growth and shrinkage is also derived along with a phase diagram, revealing that the competition of effective gas partial pressures across the two sides of the diffusion layer dominates the bubble evolution process. Strategies for controlling the bubble evolution behavior are also proposed based on the phase diagram. The current work provides a further understanding of the general behavior of bubble evolution induced by air diffusion and can be employed to better designs of functional microstructured hydrophobic surfaces.\n\nMathematical Models of Diffusion-Limited Gas Bubble Evolution in Perfused Tissue\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-08-01\n\nthe Generation of New Bubbles,â Undersea Biomedical Research, Vol. 18, No. 4 (1991), pp. 333-345. 10.

Means are provided to determine the size of any detected bubble and to provide an alarm in the absence of liquid in the sample tube.\n\nKinetics of CH4 and CO2 hydrate dissociation and gas bubble evolution via MD simulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nUddin, M; Coombe, D\n\n2014-03-20\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations of gas hydrate dissociation comparing the behavior of CH4 and CO2 hydrates are presented. These simulations were based on a structurally correct theoretical gas hydrate crystal, coexisting with water. The MD system was first initialized and stabilized via a thorough energy minimization, constant volume-temperature ensemble and constant volume-energy ensemble simulations before proceeding to constant pressure-temperature simulations for targeted dissociation pressure and temperature responses. Gas bubble evolution mechanisms are demonstrated as well as key investigative properties such as system volume, density, energy, mean square displacements of the guest molecules, radial distribution functions, H2O order parameter, and statistics of hydrogen bonds. These simulations have established the essential similarities between CH4 and CO2 hydrate dissociation. The limiting behaviors at lower temperature (no dissociation) and higher temperature (complete melting and formation of a gas bubble) have been illustrated for both hydrates. Due to the shift in the known hydrate stability curves between guest molecules caused by the choice of water model as noted by other authors, the intermediate behavior (e.g., 260 K) showed distinct differences however. Also, because of the more hydrogen-bonding capability of CO2 in water, as reflected in its molecular parameters, higher solubility of dissociated CO2 in water was observed with a consequence of a smaller size of gas bubble formation. Additionally, a novel method for analyzing hydrate dissociation based on H-bond breakage has been proposed and used to quantify the dissociation behaviors of both CH4 and CO2 hydrates. Activation energies Ea values from our MD studies were obtained and evaluated against several other published laboratory and MD values. Intrinsic rate constants were estimated and upscaled. A kinetic reaction model consistent with macroscale fitted kinetic models has been proposed to\n\nOceanic Gas Bubble Measurements Using an Acoustic Bubble Spectrometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilson, S. J.; Baschek, B.; Deane, G.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nGas bubble injection by breaking waves contributes significantly to the exchange of gases between atmosphere and ocean at high wind speeds. In this respect, CO2 is primarily important for the global ocean and climate, while O2 is especially relevant for ecosystems in the coastal ocean. For measuring oceanic gas bubble size distributions, a commercially available Dynaflow Acoustic Bubble Spectrometer (ABS) has been modified. Two hydrophones transmit and receive selected frequencies, measuring attenuation and absorption. Algorithms are then used to derive bubble size distributions. Tank test were carried out in order to test the instrument performance.The software algorithms were compared with Commander and Prosperetti's method (1989) of calculating sound speed ratio and attenuation for a known bubble distribution. Additional comparisons with micro-photography were carried out in the lab and will be continued during the SPACE '08 experiment in October 2008 at Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. The measurements of gas bubbles will be compared to additional parameters, such as wind speed, wave height, white cap coverage, or dissolved gases.\n\nBubble evolution in Kr-irradiated UO2 during annealing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, L.; Bai, X. M.; Pakarinen, J.; Jaques, B. J.; Gan, J.; Nelson, A. T.; El-Azab, A.; Allen, T. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTransmission electron microscopy observation of Kr bubble evolution in polycrystalline UO2 annealed at high temperature was conducted in order to understand the inert gas behavior in oxide nuclear fuel. The average diameter of intragranular bubbles increased gradually from 0.8 nm in as-irradiated sample at room temperature to 2.6 nm at 1600 Â°C and the bubble size distribution changed from a uniform distribution to a bimodal distribution above 1300 Â°C. The size of intergranular bubbles increased more rapidly than intragranular ones and bubble denuded zones near grain boundaries formed in all the annealed samples. It was found that high-angle grain boundaries held bigger bubbles than low-angle grain boundaries. Complementary atomistic modeling was conducted to interpret the effects of grain boundary character on the Kr segregation. The area density of strong segregation sites in the high-angle grain boundaries is much higher than that in the low angle grain boundaries.\n\nCompleting the evolution of supernova remnants and their bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSlavin, Jonathan D.; Cox, Donald P.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe filling fraction of hot gas in the ISM is reexamined with new calculations of the very long term evolution of SNRs and their fossil hot bubbles. Results are presented of a 1D numerical solution of the evolution of an SNR in a homogeneous medium with a nonthermal pressure corresponding to a 5-micro-G magnetic field and density of 0.2/cu cm. Comparison is made with a control simulation having no magnetic field pressure. It is found that the evolutions, once they have become radiative, differ in several significant ways, while both differ appreciably from qualitative pictures presented in the past. Over most of the evolution of either case, the hot bubble in the interior occupies only a small fraction of the shocked volume, the remainder in a thick shell of slightly compressed material. Column densities and radial distributions of O VI, N V, C IV, and Si IV as well as examples of absorption profiles for their strong UV lines are presented.\n\nGas embolotherapy: Bubble evolution in acoustic droplet vaporization and design of a benchtop microvascular model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWong, Zheng Zheng\n\nThis work was motivated by an ongoing development of a potential embolotherapy technique to occlude blood flow to tumors using gas bubbles selectively formed by in vivo acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) of liquid perfluorocarbon droplets. Mechanisms behind the ADV, transport and lodging of emboli need to be understood before gas embolotherapy can translate to the clinic. Evolution of a bubble from acoustic droplet vaporization in a rigid tube, under physiological and room temperature conditions, was observed via ultra-high speed imaging. Effective radii and radial expansion ratios were obtained by processing the images using Image] software. At physiological temperature, a radial expansion ratio of 5.05 was attained, consistent with theoretical prediction. The initial radial growth rate was linear, after which the growth rate increased proportionally with square root of time. Nondimensionalization revealed that the subsequent growth rate also varied inversely with square root of initial radius. Eventually growth became asymptotic. No collapse was observed. A theoretical model derived from a modified Bernoulli equation, and a computational model by Ye & Bull (2004), were compared respectively with experimental results. Initial growth rates were predicted correctly by both models. Experimental results showed heavy damping of growth rate as the bubble grew towards the wall, whereas both models predicted an overshoot in growth followed by multiple oscillations. The theoretical model broke down near the wall; the computational model gave a reasonable bubble shape near the wall but would require correct initial pressure values to be accurate. At room temperature, the expansion ratio shot to 1.43 initially and oscillated down to 1.11, far below the theoretical prediction. Failure of the bubble to expand fully could be due to unconsumed or condensed liquid perfluorocarbon. A new fabrication method via non-lithographic means was devised to make a circular\n\nBubble generation during transformer overload\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOommen, T.V.\n\n1990-03-01\n\nBubble generation in transformers has been demonstrated under certain overload conditions. The release of large quantities of bubbles would pose a dielectric breakdown hazard. A bubble prediction model developed under EPRI Project 1289-4 attempts to predict the bubble evolution temperature under different overload conditions. This report details a verification study undertaken to confirm the validity of the above model using coil structures subjected to overload conditions. The test variables included moisture in paper insulation, gas content in oil, and the type of oil preservation system. Two aged coils were also tested. The results indicated that the observed bubble temperatures weremoreÂ Â» close to the predicted temperatures for models with low initial gas content in the oil. The predicted temperatures were significantly lower than the observed temperatures for models with high gas content. Some explanations are provided for the anomalous behavior at high gas levels in oil. It is suggested that the dissolved gas content is not a significant factor in bubble evolution. The dominant factor in bubble evolution appears to be the water vapor pressure which must reach critical levels before bubbles can be released. Further study is needed to make a meaningful revision of the bubble prediction model. 8 refs., 13 figs., 11 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nA bubble-based microfluidic gas sensor for gas chromatographs.\n\nPubMed\n\nBulbul, Ashrafuzzaman; Kim, Hanseup\n\n2015-01-07\n\nWe report a new proof-of-concept bubble-based gas sensor for a gas chromatography system, which utilizes the unique relationship between the diameters of the produced bubbles with the gas types and mixture ratios as a sensing element. The bubble-based gas sensor consists of gas and liquid channels as well as a nozzle to produce gas bubbles through a micro-structure. It utilizes custom-developed software and an optical camera to statistically analyze the diameters of the produced bubbles in flow. The fabricated gas sensor showed that five types of gases (CO2, He, H2, N2, and CH4) produced (1) unique volumes of 0.44, 0.74, 1.03, 1.28, and 1.42 nL (0%, 68%, 134%, 191%, and 223% higher than that of CO2) and (2) characteristic linear expansion coefficients (slope) of 1.38, 2.93, 3.45, 5.06, and 5.44 nL/(kPa (Î¼L s(-1))(-1)). The gas sensor also demonstrated that (3) different gas mixture ratios of CO2â:âN2 (100â:â0, 80â:â20, 50â:â50, 20â:â80 and 0â:â100) generated characteristic bubble diameters of 48.95, 77.99, 71.00, 78.53 and 99.50 Î¼m, resulting in a linear coefficient of 10.26 Î¼m (Î¼L s(-1))(-1). It (4) successfully identified an injection (0.01 Î¼L) of pentane (C5) into a continuous carrier gas stream of helium (He) by monitoring bubble diameters and creating a chromatogram and demonstrated (5) the output stability within only 5.60% variation in 67 tests over a month.\n\nVapor-Gas Bubble Evolution and Growth in Extremely Viscous Fluids Under Vacuum\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKizito, John; Balasubramaniam, R.; Nahra, Henry; Agui, Juan; Truong, Duc\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFormation of vapor and gas bubbles and voids is normal and expected in flow processes involving extremely viscous fluids in normal gravity. Practical examples of extremely viscous fluids are epoxy-like filler materials before the epoxy fluids cure to their permanent form to create a mechanical bond between two substrates. When these fluids flow with a free liquid interface exposed to vacuum, rapid bubble expansion process may ensue. Bubble expansion might compromise the mechanical bond strength. The potential sources for the origin of the gases might be incomplete out-gassing process prior to filler application; regasification due to seal leakage in the filler applicator; and/or volatiles evolved from cure reaction products formed in the hardening process. We embarked on a study that involved conducting laboratory experiments with imaging diagnostics in order to deduce the seriousness of bubbling caused by entrained air and volatile fluids under space vacuum and low gravity environment. We used clear fluids with the similar physical properties as the epoxy-like filler material to mimic the dynamics of bubbles. Another aspect of the present study was to determine the likelihood of bubbling resulting from dissolved gases nucleating from solution. These experimental studies of the bubble expansion are compared with predictions using a modified Rayleigh- Plesset equation, which models the bubble expansion.\n\nFurther experimentation on bubble generation during transformer overload\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOommen, T.V.\n\n1992-03-01\n\nThis report covers additional work done during 1990 and 1991 on gas bubble generation under overload conditions. To improve visual bubble detection, a single disc coil was used. To further improve detection, a corona device was also used which signaled the onset of corona activity in the early stages of bubble formation. A total of fourteen model tests were conducted, half of which used the Inertaire system, and the remaining, a conservator (COPS). Moisture content of paper in the coil varied from 1.0% to 8.0%; gas (nitrogen) content varied from 1.0% to 8.8%. The results confirmed earlier observations that themoreÂ Â» mathematical bubble prediction model was not valid for high gas content model with relatively low moisture levels in the coil. An empirical relationship was formulated to accurately predict bubble evolution temperatures from known moisture and gas content values. For low moisture content models (below 2%), the simple Piper relationship was sufficient to predict bubble evolution temperatures, regardless of gas content. Moisture in the coil appears to be the key factor in bubble generation. Gas blanketed (Inertaire) systems do not appear to be prone to premature bubble generation from overloads as previously thought. The new bubble prediction model reveals that for a coil with 2% moisture, the bubble evolution temperature would be about 140{degrees}C. Since old transformers in service may have as much as 2% moisture in paper, the 140{degrees}C bubble evolution temperature may be taken as the lower limit of bubble evolution temperature under overload conditions for operating transformers. Drier insulation would raise the bubble evolution temperature.Â«Â less\n\nGas transfer in a bubbly wake flow\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarn, A.; Gulliver, J. S.; Monson, G. M.; Ellis, C.; Arndt, R. E. A.; Hong, J.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe present work reports simultaneous bubble size and gas transfer measurements in a bubbly wake flow of a hydrofoil, designed to be similar to a hydroturbine blade. Bubble size was measured by a shadow imaging technique and found to have a Sauter mean diameter of 0.9 mm for a reference case. A lower gas flow rate, greater liquid velocities, and a larger angle of attack all resulted in an increased number of small size bubbles and a reduced weighted mean bubble size. Bubble-water gas transfer is measured by the disturbed equilibrium technique. The gas transfer model of Azbel (1981) is utilized to characterize the liquid film coefficient for gas transfer, with one scaling coefficient to reflect the fact that characteristic turbulent velocity is replaced by cross-sectional mean velocity. The coefficient was found to stay constant at a particular hydrofoil configuration while it varied within a narrow range of 0.52-0.60 for different gas/water flow conditions.\n\nNatural Gas Evolution in a Gas Hydrate Melt: Effect of Thermodynamic Hydrate Inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSujith, K S; Ramachandran, C N\n\n2017-01-12\n\nNatural gas extraction from gas hydrate sediments by injection of hydrate inhibitors involves the decomposition of hydrates. The evolution of dissolved gas from the hydrate melt is an important step in the extraction process. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we study the evolution of dissolved methane from its hydrate melt in the presence of two thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors, NaCl and CH 3 OH. An increase in the concentration of hydrate inhibitors is found to promote the nucleation of methane nanobubbles in the hydrate melt. Whereas NaCl promotes bubble formation by enhancing the hydrophobic interaction between aqueous CH 4 molecules, CH 3 OH molecules assist bubble formation by stabilizing CH 4 bubble nuclei formed in the solution. The CH 3 OH molecules accumulate around the nuclei leading to a decrease in the surface tension at their interface with water. The nanobubbles formed are found to be highly dynamic with frequent exchange of CH 4 molecules between the bubble and the surrounding liquid. A quantitative analysis of the dynamic behavior of the bubble is performed by introducing a unit step function whose value depends on the location of CH 4 molecules with respect to the bubble. It is observed that an increase in the concentration of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors reduces the exchange process, making the bubble less dynamic. It is also found that for a given concentration of the inhibitor, larger bubbles are less dynamic compared to smaller ones. The dependence of the dynamic nature of nanobubbles on bubble size and inhibitor concentration is correlated with the solubility of CH 4 and the Laplace pressure within the bubble. The effect of CO 2 on the formation of nanobubble in the CH 4 -CO 2 mixed gas hydrate melt in the presence of inhibitors is also examined. The simulations show that the presence of CO 2 molecules significantly reduces the induction time for methane nanobubble nucleation. The role of CO 2 in the early nucleation of\n\nFormation of soap bubbles by gas jet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Maolei; Li, Min; Chen, Zhiyuan; Han, Jifeng; Liu, Dong\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSoap bubbles can be easily generated by various methods, while their formation process is complicated and still worth studying. A model about the bubble formation process was proposed in the study by Salkin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 077801 (2016)] recently, and it was reported that the bubbles were formed when the gas blowing velocity was above one threshold. However, after a detailed study of these experiments, we found that the bubbles could be generated in two velocity ranges which corresponded to the laminar and turbulent gas jet, respectively, and the predicted threshold was only effective for turbulent gas flow. The study revealed that the bubble formation was greatly influenced by the aerodynamics of the gas jet blowing to the film, and these results will help to further understand the formation mechanism of the soap bubble as well as the interaction between the gas jet and the thin liquid film.\n\nOn the role of sea-state in bubble-mediated air-sea gas flux during a winter storm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Jun-Hong; Emerson, Steven R.; D'Asaro, Eric A.; McNeil, Craig L.; Harcourt, Ramsey R.; Sullivan, Peter P.; Yang, Bo; Cronin, Meghan F.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOceanic bubbles play an important role in the air-sea exchange of weakly soluble gases at moderate to high wind speeds. A Lagrangian bubble model embedded in a large eddy simulation model is developed to study bubbles and their influence on dissolved gases in the upper ocean. The transient evolution of mixed-layer dissolved oxygen and nitrogen gases at Ocean Station Papa (50Â°N, 145Â°W) during a winter storm is reproduced with the model. Among different physical processes, gas bubbles are the most important in elevating dissolved gas concentrations during the storm, while atmospheric pressure governs the variability of gas saturation anomaly (the relative departure of dissolved gas concentration from the saturation concentration). For the same wind speed, bubble-mediated gas fluxes are larger during rising wind with smaller wave age than during falling wind with larger wave age. Wave conditions are the primary cause for the bubble gas flux difference: when wind strengthens, waves are less-developed with respect to wind, resulting in more frequent large breaking waves. Bubble generation in large breaking waves is favorable for a large bubble-mediated gas flux. The wave-age dependence is not included in any existing bubble-mediated gas flux parameterizations.\n\nInteraction of strong converging shock wave with SF6 gas bubble\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Yu; Zhai, ZhiGang; Luo, XiSheng\n\n2018-06-01\n\nInteraction of a strong converging shock wave with an SF6 gas bubble is studied, focusing on the effects of shock intensity and shock shape on interface evolution. Experimentally, the converging shock wave is generated by shock dynamics theory and the gas bubble is created by soap film technique. The post-shock flow field is captured by a schlieren photography combined with a high-speed video camera. Besides, a three-dimensional program is adopted to provide more details of flow field. After the strong converging shock wave impact, a wide and pronged outward jet, which differs from that in planar shock or weak converging shock condition, is derived from the downstream interface pole. This specific phenomenon is considered to be closely associated with shock intensity and shock curvature. Disturbed by the gas bubble, the converging shocks approaching the convergence center have polygonal shapes, and the relationship between shock intensity and shock radius verifies the applicability of polygonal converging shock theory. Subsequently, the motion of upstream point is discussed, and a modified nonlinear theory considering rarefaction wave and high amplitude effects is proposed. In addition, the effects of shock shape on interface morphology and interface scales are elucidated. These results indicate that the shape as well as shock strength plays an important role in interface evolution.\n\nBubble Transport through Micropillar Arrays\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Kenneth; Savas, Omer\n\n2012-11-01\n\nIn current energy research, artificial photosynthetic devices are being designed to split water and harvest hydrogen gas using energy from the sun. In one such design, hydrogen gas bubbles evolve on the catalytic surfaces of arrayed micropillars. If these bubbles are not promptly removed from the surface, they can adversely affect gas evolution rates, water flow rates, sunlight capture, and heat management of the system. Therefore, an efficient method of collecting the evolved gas bubbles is crucial. Preliminary flow visualization has been conducted of bubbles advecting through dense arrays of pillars. Bubbles moving through square and hexagonal arrays are tracked, and the results are qualitatively described. Initial attempts to correlate bubble motion with relevant lengthscales and forces are also presented. These observations suggest how bubble transport within such pillar arrays can be managed, as well as guide subsequent experiments that investigate bubble evolution and collection. This material is based upon work performed by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, supported through the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Award Number DE-SC0004993.\n\nFurther experimentation on bubble generation during transformer overload.

Certain very important effects of high energy density physics, i.e. liquid compressibility, shock-wave formation under the collapse of the gas cavity in liquid, shock-wave focusing in the gas-filled cavity, occurrence of hot dense plasma in the focusing area, and high-temperature radiation yield are observed in this phenomenon. Specificity of the process is conditioned by the ``ideal'' preparation and sphericity of the gas-and-liquid contact boundary what makes the collapse process efficient due to the reduced influence of hydrodynamic instabilities. Results of experimental investigations; results of developing the facilities, description of methods used to register parameters of facilities and the system under consideration; analytical estimates how gas-filled bubbles evolve in liquid with the regard for scale effects; results of preliminary 1-D gas dynamic calculations of the gas bubble evolution are presented.

The bubble growth is presumed to be thermally controlled, and two components of heat transfer to the bubble are accounted of: the one from the bulk of surrounding liquid and the one due to heat conduction across a liquid microlayer formed underneath the bubble. Bubble evolution is governed by the buoyancy and an effective surface tension force, both the forces making the bubble centre of mass move away from the wall and, thus, assisting its detachment. Buoyancy-controlled and surface-tension-controlled regimes are considered separately in a meticulous way. The duration of the whole process of bubble evolution till detachment, the rate of growth, and the bubble departure size are found as functions of time and physical and operating parameters. Some repeatedly observed phenomena, such as an influence of gravity on the growth rate, are explained. Inferences of the model agree qualitatively with available experimental evidence, and conclusions pertaining to the dependence on gravity of the bubble radius at detachment and the whole time of the bubble development when being attached to the wall are confirmed quantitatively.\n\nEvolution of vacuum bubbles embedded in inhomogeneous spacetimes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPannia, Florencia Anabella Teppa; Bergliaffa, Santiago Esteban Perez, E-mail: fteppa@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar, E-mail: sepbergliaffa@gmail.com\n\nWe study the propagation of bubbles of new vacuum in a radially inhomogeneous background filled with dust or radiation, and including a cosmological constant, as a first step in the analysis of the influence of inhomogeneities in the evolution of an inflating region. We also compare the cases with dust and radiation backgrounds and show that the evolution of the bubble in radiation environments is notably different from that in the corresponding dust cases, both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous ambients, leading to appreciable differences in the evolution of the proper radius of the bubble.\n\nGas Bubble Migration and Trapping in Porous Media: Pore-Scale Simulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahabadi, Nariman; Zheng, Xianglei; Yun, Tae Sup; van Paassen, Leon; Jang, Jaewon\n\n2018-02-01\n\nGas bubbles can be naturally generated or intentionally introduced in sediments. Gas bubble migration and trapping affect the rate of gas emission into the atmosphere or modify the sediment properties such as hydraulic and mechanical properties. In this study, the migration and trapping of gas bubbles are simulated using the pore-network model extracted from the 3D X-ray image of in situ sediment. Two types of bubble size distribution (mono-sized and distributed-sized cases) are used in the simulation. The spatial and statistical bubble size distribution, residual gas saturation, and hydraulic conductivity reduction due to the bubble trapping are investigated. The results show that the bubble size distribution becomes wider during the gas bubble migration due to bubble coalescence for both mono-sized and distributed-sized cases. And the trapped bubble fraction and the residual gas saturation increase as the bubble size increases. The hydraulic conductivity is reduced as a result of the gas bubble trapping. The reduction in hydraulic conductivity is apparently observed as bubble size and the number of nucleation points increase.\n\nFormation and evolution of bubbly screens in confined oscillating bubbly liquids.\n\nPubMed\n\nShklyaev, Sergey; Straube, Arthur V\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe consider the dynamics of dilute monodisperse bubbly liquid confined by two plane solid walls and subject to small-amplitude high-frequency oscillations normal to the walls. The initial state corresponds to the uniform distribution of bubbles and motionless liquid. The period of external driving is assumed much smaller than typical relaxation times for a single bubble but larger than the period of volume eigenoscillations. The time-averaged description accounting for the two-way coupling between the liquid and the bubbles is applied. We show that the model predicts accumulation of bubbles in thin sheets parallel to the walls. These singular structures, which are formally characterized by infinitely thin width and infinitely high concentration, are referred to as bubbly screens. The formation of a bubbly screen is described analytically in terms of a self-similar solution, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. We study the evolution of bubbly screens and detect a one-dimensional stationary state, which is shown to be unconditionally unstable.\n\nFormation and evolution of bubbly screens in confined oscillating bubbly liquids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShklyaev, Sergey; Straube, Arthur V.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe consider the dynamics of dilute monodisperse bubbly liquid confined by two plane solid walls and subject to small-amplitude high-frequency oscillations normal to the walls.

Chemical reactors, water treatment devices or gas-free delivery of liquids like propellant are only some of them. We study the performance of a woven metal screen in respect to its phase separation behavior under static and dynamic conditions. Beside hydraulic screen resistance and static bubble point, our study also comprises the bubble detachment from the screen upon gas breakthrough. Since a woven screen is essentially an array of identical pores, analogies to bubble detachment from a needle can be established. While the bubble point poses an upper limit for pressurized gas at a wetted screen to preclude gas breakthrough, the necessary pressure for growing bubbles to detach from the screen pores a lower limit when breakthrough is already in progress. Based on that inside, the dynamic bubble point effects were constituted that relate to a trapped bubble at such a screen in liquid flow. A trapped is caused to break through the screen by the flow-induced pressure drop across it. Our model includes axially symmetric bubble shapes, degree of coverage of the screen and bubble pressurization due to hydraulic losses in the rest of the circuit. We have built an experiment that consists of a Dutch Twilled woven screen made of stainless steel in a vertical acrylic glass tube. The liquid is silicon oil SF0.65. The screen is suspended perpendicular to the liquid flow which is forced through it at variable flow rate. Controlled injection of air from a needle allows us to examine the ability of the screen to separate gas and liquid along the former mentioned effects. We present experimental data on static bubble point and detachment pressure for breakthrough at different gas supply rates that suggest a useful criterion for reliable static bubble point measurements. Results for the dynamic bubble point are presented that include i) screen pressure drop for different\n\nAnalysis of intergranular fission-gas bubble-size distributions in irradiated uranium-molybdenum alloy fuel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRest, J.; Hofman, G. L.; Kim, Yeon Soo\n\n2009-04-01\n\nAn analytical model for the nucleation and growth of intra and intergranular fission-gas bubbles is used to characterize fission-gas bubble development in low-enriched U-Mo alloy fuel irradiated in the advanced test reactor in Idaho as part of the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactor (RERTR) program. Fuel burnup was limited to less than Ë7.8 at.% U in order to capture the fuel-swelling stage prior to irradiation-induced recrystallization. The model couples the calculation of the time evolution of the average intergranular bubble radius and number density to the calculation of the intergranular bubble-size distribution based on differential growth rate and sputtering coalescence processes. Recent results on TEM analysis of intragranular bubbles in U-Mo were used to set the irradiation-induced diffusivity and re-solution rate in the bubble-swelling model. Using these values, good agreement was obtained for intergranular bubble distribution compared against measured post-irradiation examination (PIE) data using grain-boundary diffusion enhancement factors of 15-125, depending on the Mo concentration. This range of enhancement factors is consistent with values obtained in the literature.\n\nBubble transport and sticking in gas embolotherapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBull, Joseph\n\n2002-11-01\n\nPressure-driven bubble transport in a two-dimensional, bifurcating channel is investigated as a model of gas emboli transport in the microcirculation. Gas emboli are relevant to a number of clinical situations, and our particular interest is a novel gas embolotherapy technique, which involves using gas bubbles to occlude blood flow to tumors. This minimally invasive treatment modality allows selective delivery of emboli. The bubbles originate as 6 micron-diameter liquid droplets of perfluorocarbon (PFC), mixed in saline, and are injected into the vascular system. The droplet forms are small enough to pass through capillary beds, so they can circulate until the next stage of the therapy. By strategically placing an ultrasound source over the artery feeding the tumor, the droplets may be vaporized at that location. Our model is developed using the Stokes equation subject to interfacial and wall boundary conditions, and is solved using the boundary element method. The conditions under which bubbles 'stick' to the channel walls and occlude flow are investigated. Clinically, these results are important because the location and homogeneity of bubble sticking determines the degree of tumor necrosis and the efficacy of the treatment.\n\nTransformer overload characteristics---Bubble evolution\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWoods, E.E.; Wendel, R.C.; Dresser, R.D.\n\n1988-08-01\n\nProject RP1289-3 explores significant parameters affecting bubble evolution from transformer oil under high temperature operating conditions to address the question: Does ''real life'' operation of a transformer cause harmful bubbling conditions. Studies outlined in the project are designed to determine when bubbling occurs in transformers and if bubbling can be harmful during the normal operation of these transformers. Data obtained from these studies should provide a basis for utilities to perform risk assessments in relation to their loading practices. The program is designed to demonstrate those conditions under which bubbling occurs in transformers by using controlled models and actual signalmoreÂ Â» phase transformers that were designed to give access to both high and low voltage windings for the purpose of viewing bubble generation. Results and observations from tests on the full-size transformers, thermal models, and electrical models have led to the conclusion that bubbles can occur under operating conditions. The electrical models show that dielectric strength can be reduced by as much as 40 percent due to the presence of bubbles. Because of factory safety considerations, the transformers could not be tested at hot spot temperatures greater than 140/degree/C. Therefore, there is no information on the dielectric strength of the full-size transformers under bubbling conditions. 4 refs., 28 figs., 45 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nGas Diffusion in Fluids Containing Bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZak, M.; Weinberg, M.

In the presence of a bubble blowing agent, hollow spheres can be prepared by bubbling a silica sol. Herein, the trapped gas inside the bubble acts as a template. When the porogen, i.e., other surfactant, is introduced, a mesostructured shell forms by the co-assembly with the silica sol during sol-gel process. Morphological evolution emphasizes the prerequisite of an intermediate interior gas flow rate and high exterior gas flow rate for hollow spheres. The method is valid for many compositions from inorganic, polymer to their composites. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

[1], Schmidt [2]). When a non-condensable gas is injected through a liquid, the liquid component would evaporate into the bubble if its partial pressure in the bubble is lower than its vapour pressure. This would tend to cool the liquid. Earlier works on injection cooling was analysed by Larsen et al. [1], Schmidt [2], Cho et al. [3] and Jung et al. [4], considering instantaneous mass transfer and finite heat transfer between gas bubble and liquid. It is felt that bubble dynamics (break up, coalescence, deformation, trajectory etc.) should also play a significant role in liquid cooling. The reported work are based on simple assumptions like single bubble, zero bubble deformation, and no inter-bubble interactions. Hence in this work, we propose a lumped parameter model considering both heat and mass interactions between bubble and the liquid to gain a preliminary insight into the cooling phenomenon during gas injection through a liquid.\n\nEffect of Slotted Anode on Gas Bubble Behaviors in Aluminum Reduction Cell\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Meijia; Li, Baokuan; Li, Linmin; Wang, Qiang; Peng, Jianping; Wang, Yaowu; Cheung, Sherman C. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the aluminum reduction cells, gas bubbles are generated at the bottom of the anode which eventually reduces the effective current contact area and the system efficiency. To encourage the removal of gas bubbles, slotted anode has been proposed and increasingly adopted by some industrial aluminum reduction cells. Nonetheless, the exact gas bubble removal mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. A three-dimensional (3D) transient, multiphase flow mathematical model coupled with magnetohydrodynamics has been developed to investigate the effect of slotted anode on the gas bubble movement. The Eulerian volume of fluid approach is applied to track the electrolyte (bath)-molten aluminum (metal) interface. Meanwhile, the Lagrangian discrete particle model is employed to handle the dynamics of gas bubbles with considerations of the buoyancy force, drag force, virtual mass force, and pressure gradient force. The gas bubble coalescence process is also taken into account based on the O'Rourke's algorithm. The two-way coupling between discrete bubbles and fluids is achieved by the inter-phase momentum exchange. Numerical predictions are validated against the anode current variation in an industrial test. Comparing the results using slotted anode with the traditional one, the time-averaged gas bubble removal rate increases from 36 to 63 pct; confirming that the slotted anode provides more escaping ways and shortens the trajectories for gas bubbles. Furthermore, the slotted anode also reduces gas bubble's residence time and the probability of coalescence. Moreover, the bubble layer thickness in aluminum cell with slotted anode is reduced about 3.5 mm (17.4 pct), so the resistance can be cut down for the sake of energy saving and the metal surface fluctuation amplitude is significantly reduced for the stable operation due to the slighter perturbation with smaller bubbles.\n\nGrowth and setting of gas bubbles in a viscoelastic matrix imaged by X-ray microtomography: the evolution of cellular structures in fermenting wheat flour dough.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurbin-Orger, A; Babin, P; Boller, E; Chaunier, L; Chiron, H; Della Valle, G; Dendievel, R; RÃ©guerre, A L; Salvo, L\n\n2015-05-07\n\nX-ray tomography is a relevant technique for the dynamic follow-up of gas bubbles in an opaque viscoelastic matrix, especially using image analysis. It has been applied here to pieces of fermenting wheat flour dough of various compositions, at two different voxel sizes (15 and 5 Î¼m). The resulting evolution of the main cellular features shows that the creation of cellular structures follows two regimes that are defined by a characteristic time of connectivity, tc [30 and 80 min]: first (t â¤ tc), bubbles grow freely and then (t â¥ tc) they become connected since the percolation of the gas phase is limited by liquid films. During the first regime, bubbles can be tracked and the local strain rate can be measured. Its values (10(-4)-5 Ã 10(-4) s(-1)) are in agreement with those computed from dough viscosity and internal gas pressure, both of which depend on the composition. For higher porosity, P = 0.64 in our case, and thus occurring in the second regime, different cellular structures are obtained and XRT images show deformed gas cells that display complex shapes. The comparison of these images with confocal laser scanning microscopy images suggests the presence of liquid films that separate these cells. The dough can therefore be seen as a three-phase medium: viscoelastic matrix/gas cell/liquid phase. The contributions of the different levels of matter organization can be integrated by defining a capillary number (C = 0.1-1) that makes it possible to predict the macroscopic dough behavior.\n\nFormation mechanism of gas bubble superlattice in UMo metal fuels: Phase-field modeling investigation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHu, Shenyang; Burkes, Douglas E.; Lavender, Curt A.\n\n2016-07-08\n\nNano-gas bubble superlattices are often observed in irradiated UMo nuclear fuels. However, the for- mation mechanism of gas bubble superlattices is not well understood. A number of physical processes may affect the gas bubble nucleation and growth; hence, the morphology of gas bubble microstructures including size and spatial distributions. In this work, a phase-field model integrating a first-passage Monte Carlo method to investigate the formation mechanism of gas bubble superlattices was devel- oped. Six physical processes are taken into account in the model: 1) heterogeneous generation of gas atoms, vacancies, and interstitials informed from atomistic simulations; 2) one-dimensional (1-D) migration of interstitials; 3) irradiation-induced dissolution of gas atoms; 4) recombination between vacancies and interstitials; 5) elastic interaction; and 6) heterogeneous nucleation of gas bubbles. We found that the elastic interaction doesnât cause the gas bubble alignment, and fast 1-D migration of interstitials alongmoreÂ Â» $$\\\\langle$$110$$\\\\rangle$$ directions in the body-centered cubic U matrix causes the gas bubble alignment along $$\\\\langle$$110$$\\\\rangle$$ directions. It implies that 1-D interstitial migration along [110] direction should be the primary mechanism of a fcc gas bubble superlattice which is observed in bcc UMo alloys. Simulations also show that fission rates, saturated gas concentration, and elastic interaction all affect the morphology of gas bubble microstructures.Â«Â less\n\nReviewâPhysicochemical hydrodynamics of gas bubbles in two phase electrochemical systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTaqieddin, Amir; Nazari, Roya; Rajic, Ljiljana; Alshawabkeh, Akram\n\n2018-01-01\n\nElectrochemical systems suffer from poor management of evolving gas bubbles.

The evolution of helium bubbles and discs was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. An irradiated layer distributed with fine helium bubbles was formed with a width of ~170 nm after helium ion irradiation. The size of gas bubbles increased with increasing annealing time and temperature and finally reached stable values at a given annealing temperature. According to the relationship between the bubble radii and annealing time, an empirical formula for calculating the bubble radii at the annealing temperature ranged from 600 to 1400 Â°C was given by fitting the experiment data. Planar bubble clusters (discs) were found to form on (0001) crystal plane at both sides of the bubble layer when the annealing temperature was at the range of 800-1200 Â°C. The mechanism of bubble growth during post-implantation annealing and the formation of bubble discs were also analyzed and discussed.\n\nAnterior chamber gas bubble emergence pattern during femtosecond LASIK-flap creation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobert, Marie-Claude; Khreim, Nour; Todani, Amit; Melki, Samir A\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo characterise the emergence pattern of cavitation bubbles into the anterior chamber (AC) following femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)-flap creation Retrospective review of patients undergoing femtosecond LASIK surgery at Boston Laser, a private refractive surgery practice in Boston, Massachusetts, between December 2008 and February 2014. Patient charts were reviewed to identify all cases with gas bubble migration into the AC. Surgical videos were examined and the location of bubble entry was recorded separately for right and left eyes. Five thousand one hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent femtosecond LASIK surgery. Air bubble migration into the AC, presumably via the Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork, occurred in 1% of cases. Patients with AC bubbles had an average age of 33Â±8â years with a measured LASIK flap thickness of 96Â±21â Î¼m. The occurrence of gas bubbles impaired iris registration in 64% of cases. Gas bubbles appeared preferentially in the nasal or inferior quadrants for right (92% of cases) and left (100% of cases) eyes. This bubble emergence pattern is significantly different from that expected with a random distribution (p<0.0001) and did not seem associated with decentration of the femtosecond laser docking system. The migration of gas bubbles into the AC is a rare occurrence during femtosecond laser flap creation. The preferential emergence of gas bubbles into the nasal and inferior quadrants of the AC may indicate a distinctive anatomy of the nasal Schlemm's canal.

Since gravity plays an essential role in currently available techniques, the adaptation of these applications to space requires the development of new tools. Under normal gravity, bubbles are typically generated by forcing gas through an orifice in a liquid. When a growing bubble becomes large enough, the buoyancy dominates the surface tension force causing it to detach from the orifice. In space, the process is quite different and the bubble may remain attached to the orifice indefinitely. The most practical approach to simulating gravity seems to be imposing an ambient flow to force bubbles out of the orifice. In this paper, we are interested in the effect of an imposed flow in 0 and 1 g. Specifically, we investigate the process of bubble formation subject to a parallel and a cross flow. In the case of parallel flow, we have a hypodermic needle in a tube from which bubbles can be produced. On the other hand, the cross flow condition is established by forcing bubbles through an orifice on a wall in a shear flow. The first series of experiments have been performed under normal gravity conditions and the working fluid was water. A high quality microgravity facility has been used for the second type and silicone oil is used as the host liquid.\n\nTwo-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Ultrasound in Liquids with Gas Bubble Agglomerates: Examples of Bubbly-Liquid-Type Acoustic Metamaterials (BLAMMs)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVanhille, Christian\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis work deals with a theoretical analysis about the possibility of using linear and nonlinear acoustic properties to modify ultrasound by adding gas bubbles of determined sizes in a liquid. We use a two-dimensional numerical model to evaluate the effect that one and several monodisperse bubble populations confined in restricted areas of a liquid have on ultrasound by calculating their nonlinear interaction. The filtering of an input ultrasonic pulse performed by a net of bubbly-liquid cells is analyzed. The generation of a low-frequency component from a single cell impinged by a two-frequency harmonic wave is also studied. These effects rely on the particular dispersive character of attenuation and nonlinearity of such bubbly fluids, which can be extremely high near bubble resonance. They allow us to observe how gas bubbles can change acoustic signals. Variations of the bubbly medium parameters induce alterations of the effects undergone by ultrasound. Results suggest that acoustic signals can be manipulated by bubbles. This capacity to achieve the modification and control of sound with oscillating gas bubbles introduces the concept of bubbly-liquid-based acoustic metamaterials (BLAMMs).

When the temperature decreases to 20 K, the enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of the samples results in an increase of the domain size in the continuous film and the magnetization-reversal behavior of each nanodot becomes independent, and most reversed dots do not depend on each other, indicating the magnetic characteristics of a single domain. The present research provides further understanding of the evolution of magnetic bubbles in the Fe/Gd system and suggests their promising applications in patterned recording materials.\n\nBubble composition of natural gas seeps discovered along the Cascadia Continental Margin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaumberger, T.; Merle, S. G.; Embley, R. W.; Seabrook, S.; Raineault, N.; Lilley, M. D.; Evans, L. J.; Walker, S. L.; Lupton, J. E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nGas hydrates and gas-filled pockets present in sedimentary deposits have been recognized as large reservoirs for reduced carbon in the Earth's crust. This is particularly relevant in geological settings with high carbon input, such as continental margins. During expedition NA072 on the E/V Nautilus (operated by the Ocean Exploration Trust Inc.) in June 2016, the U.S. Cascadia Continental Margin (Washington, Oregon and northern California) was explored for gas seepage from sediments. During this expedition, over 400 bubble plumes at water depths ranging from 125 and 1640 m were newly discovered, and five of them were sampled for gas bubble composition using specially designed gas tight fluid samplers mounted on the Hercules remotely operated vehicle (ROV). These gas bubble samples were collected at four different depths, 494 m (rim of Astoria Canyon), 615 and 620 m (SW Coquille Bank), 849 m (floor of Astoria Canyon) and 1227 m (Heceta SW). At the two deeper sites, exposed hydrate was present in the same area where bubbles were seeping out from the seafloor. Other than the escaping gas bubbles, no other fluid flow was visible. However, the presence of bacterial mats point to diffuse fluid flow present in the affected area. In this study we present the results of the currently ongoing geochemical analysis of the gas bubbles released at the different sites and depths. Noble gas analysis, namely helium and neon, will give information about the source of the helium as well as about potential fractionation between helium and neon associated with gas hydrates. The characterization of these gas samples will also include total gas (CO2, H2, N2, O2, Ar, CH4 and other hydrocarbons) and stable isotope analysis (C and H). This dataset will reveal the chemical composition of the seeping bubbles as well as give information about the possible sources of the carbon contained in the seeping gas.\n\nBubble video experiments in the marine waters off Panarea Island (Italy): real-world data for modelling CO2 bubble dissolution and evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeaubien, Stan; De Vittor, Cinzia; McGinnis, Dan; Bigi, Sabina; Comici, Cinzia; Ingrosso, Gianmarco; Lombardi, Salvatore; Ruggiero, Livio\n\n2014-05-01\n\nCarbon capture and storage is expected to provide an important, short-term contribution to mitigate global climate change due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2. Offshore reservoirs are particularly favourable, however concerns exist regarding the potential for CO2 leakage into the water column (with possible ecosystem impacts) and the atmosphere. Although laboratory experiments and modelling can examine these issues, the study of natural systems can provide a more complete and realistic understanding. For this reason the natural CO2 emission site off the coast of Panarea Island (Italy) was chosen for study within the EC-funded ECO2 project. The present paper discusses the results of field experiments conducted at this site to better understand the fate of CO2 gas bubbles as they rise through the water column, and to use this real-world data as input to test the predictive capabilities of a bubble model. Experiments were conducted using a 1m wide x 1m deep x 3m tall, hollow-tube structure equipped with a vertical guide on the front face and a dark, graduated cloth for contrast and depth reference on the back. A Plexiglas box was filled with the naturally emitted gas and fixed on the seafloor inside the structure. Tubes exit the top of the box to make bubbles of different diameters, while valves on each tube control bubble release rate. Bubble rise velocity was measured by tracking each bubble with a HD video camera mounted in the guide and calculating values over 20 cm intervals. Bubble diameter was measured by filming the bubbles as they collide with a graduated Plexiglas sheet deployed horizontally at the measurement height. Bubble gas was collected at different heights using a funnel and analysed in the laboratory for CO2, O2+Ar, N2, and CH4. Water parameters were measured by performing a CTD cast beside the structure and collecting water samples at four depths using a Niskin bottle; samples were analysed in the laboratory for all carbonate system species, DO\n\nDecompression vs. Decomposition: Distribution, Amount, and Gas Composition of Bubbles in Stranded Marine Mammals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde QuirÃ³s, Yara Bernaldo; GonzÃ¡lez-Diaz, Oscar; Arbelo, Manuel; Sierra, Eva; Sacchini, Simona; FernÃ¡ndez, Antonio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGas embolic lesions linked to military sonar have been described in stranded cetaceans including beaked whales. These descriptions suggest that gas bubbles in marine mammal tissues may be more common than previously thought. In this study we have analyzed gas amount (by gas score) and gas composition within different decomposition codes using a standardized methodology. This broad study has allowed us to explore species-specific variability in bubble prevalence, amount, distribution, and composition, as well as masking of bubble content by putrefaction gases. Bubbles detected within the cardiovascular system and other tissues related to both pre- and port-mortem processes are a common finding on necropsy of stranded cetaceans. To minimize masking by putrefaction gases, necropsy, and gas sampling must be performed as soon as possible. Before 24âh post mortem is recommended but preferably within 12âh post mortem. At necropsy, amount of bubbles (gas score) in decomposition code 2 in stranded cetaceans was found to be more important than merely presence vs. absence of bubbles from a pathological point of view. Deep divers presented higher abundance of gas bubbles, mainly composed of 70% nitrogen and 30% CO2, suggesting a higher predisposition of these species to suffer from decompression-related gas embolism.

Rabbits with a perfluoropropane/air gas mixture filling approximately 60% of the vitreous cavity of the right eye were exposed to 3 different hyperbaric pressure profiles to an equivalent depth of 33 feet. The first group were a control group and were not exposed to hyperbaric pressures. The second group remained at an equivalent depth of 33 feet for 30 minutes, and the third group remained at 33 feet for 1 minute. Both groups ascended to normal atmospheric pressure at a rate of 1 foot per minute. The fourth group remained at 33 feet for 1 minute and then ascended at a rate of 0.2 feet per minute. In all eyes with an intraocular gas bubble, intraocular pressure dropped to zero when the atmospheric pressure was increased, and rose to more than 50 mmHg when the atmospheric pressure was returned to normal. Pressures in excess of 50 mmHg were sustained for 10 minutes or longer in each rabbit exposed to one of the hyperbaric profiles. No significant intraocular pressure changes were observed in eyes without an intraocular gas bubble or eyes not exposed to hyperbaric pressure. Marked elevation in intraocular pressure occurs as a result of hyperbaric exposure in eyes with an intraocular gas bubble. Hyperbaric exposure is therefore not advisable for patients with intraocular gas bubbles.\n\nThe shape and motion of gas bubbles in a liquid flowing through a thin annulus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLei, Qinghua; Xie, Zhihua; Pavlidis, Dimitrios; Salinas, Pablo; Veltin, Jeremy; Muggeridge, Ann; Pain, Christopher C.; Matar, Omar K.; Jackson, Matthew; Arland, Kristine; Gyllensten, Atle\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe study the shape and motion of gas bubbles in a liquid flowing through a horizontal or slightly-inclined thin annulus. Experimental data show that in the horizontal annulus, bubbles develop a unique ``tadpole'' shape with an elliptical cap and a highly-stretched tail, due to the confinement between the closely-spaced channel walls. As the annulus is inclined, the bubble tail tends to decrease in length, while the geometry of the cap remains almost invariant. To model the bubble evolution, the thin annulus is conceptualised as a ``Hele-Shaw'' cell in a curvilinear space. The three-dimensional flow within the cell is represented by a gap-averaged, two-dimensional model constrained by the same dimensionless quantities. The complex bubble dynamics are solved using a mixed control-volume finite-element method combined with interface-capturing and mesh adaptation techniques. A close match to the experimental data is achieved, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by the numerical simulations. The mechanism for the elliptical cap formation is interpreted based on an analogous irrotational flow field around a circular cylinder. The shape regimes of bubbles flowing through the thin annulus are further explored based on the simulation results.

In many of these applications, high uniformity of the size of the gas bubbles is critical to achieve the desired properties and functionality. While microfluidics have been used with success to create gas bubbles that have a uniformity not achievable using conventional methods, the inherently low volumetric flow rate of microfluidics has limited its use in most applications. Parallelization of liquid droplet generators, in which many droplet generators are incorporated onto a single chip, has shown great promise for the large scale production of monodisperse liquid emulsion droplets. However, the scale-up of monodisperse gas bubbles using such an approach has remained a challenge because of possible coupling between parallel bubbles generators and feedback effects from the downstream channels. In this report, we systematically investigate the effect of factors such as viscosity of the continuous phase, capillary number, and gas pressure as well as the channel uniformity on the size distribution of gas bubbles in a parallelized microfluidic device. We show that, by optimizing the flow conditions, a device with 400 parallel flow focusing generators on a footprint of 5 Ã 5 cm 2 can be used to generate gas bubbles with a coefficient of variation of less than 5% at a production rate of approximately 1 L h -1 . Our results suggest that the optimization of flow conditions using a device with a small number (e.g., 8) of parallel FFGs can facilitate large-scale bubble production.\n\nLiquid jet pumped by rising gas bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHussain, N. A.; Siegel, R.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA two-phase mathematical model is proposed for calculating the induced turbulent vertical liquid flow. Bubbles provide a large buoyancy force and the associated drag on the liquid moves the liquid upward. The liquid pumped upward consists of the bubble wakes and the liquid brought into the jet region by turbulent entrainment. The expansion of the gas bubbles as they rise through the liquid is taken into account. The continuity and momentum equations are solved numerically for an axisymmetric air jet submerged in water. Water pumping rates are obtained as a function of air flow rate and depth of submergence. Comparisons are made with limited experimental information in the literature.\n\nEffects of non-condensable gas on the dynamic oscillations of cavitation bubbles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yuning\n\n2016-11-01\n\nCavitation is an essential topic of multiphase flow with a broad range of applications. Generally, there exists non-condensable gas in the liquid and a complex vapor/gas mixture bubble will be formed. A rigorous prediction of the dynamic behavior of the aforementioned mixture bubble is essential for the development of a complete cavitation model. In the present paper, effects of non-condensable gas on the dynamic oscillations of the vapor/gas mixture bubble are numerically investigated in great detail. For the completeness, a large parameter zone (e.g. bubble radius, frequency and ratio between gas and vapor) is investigated with many demonstrating examples. The mechanisms of mass diffusion are categorized into different groups with their characteristics and dominated regions given. Influences of non-condensable gas on the wave propagation (e.g. wave speed and attenuation) in the bubbly liquids are also briefly discussed. Specifically, the minimum wave speed is quantitatively predicted in order to close the pressure-density coupling relationship usually employed for the cavitation modelling. Finally, the application of the present finding on the development of cavitation model is demonstrated with a brief discussion of its influence on the cavitation dynamics.

If the external fluid is highly viscous (Î·ext>100 cP), the radius is proportional to the time before break, Ï, and decreases smoothly to zero. If the external fluid has low viscosity (Î·ext<10 cP), the neck radius scales as &1/2circ; until an instability develops in the gas bubble which causes the neck to rupture and tear apart. Finally, if the viscosity of the external fluid is in an intermediate range, an elongated thread is formed which breaks apart into micron-sized bubbles. 100,000 frame-per-second videos will be presented which illustrate each of these flow regimes.\n\nLinear oscillation of gas bubbles in a viscoelastic material under ultrasound irradiation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHamaguchi, Fumiya; Ando, Keita, E-mail: kando@mech.keio.ac.jp\n\n2015-11-15\n\nAcoustically forced oscillation of spherical gas bubbles in a viscoelastic material is studied through comparisons between experiments and linear theory. An experimental setup has been designed to visualize bubble dynamics in gelatin gels using a high-speed camera. A spherical gas bubble is created by focusing an infrared laser pulse into (gas-supersaturated) gelatin gels. The bubble radius (up to 150 Î¼m) under mechanical equilibrium is controlled by gradual mass transfer of gases across the bubble interface. The linearized bubble dynamics are studied from the observation of spherical bubble oscillation driven by low-intensity, planar ultrasound driven at 28 kHz. It follows frommoreÂ Â» the experiment for an isolated bubble that the frequency response in its volumetric oscillation was shifted to the high frequency side and its peak was suppressed as the gelatin concentration increases. The measurement is fitted to the linearized RayleighâPlesset equation coupled with the Voigt constitutive equation that models the behavior of linear viscoelastic solids; the fitting yields good agreement by tuning unknown values of the viscosity and rigidity, indicating that more complex phenomena including shear thinning, stress relaxation, and retardation do not play an important role for the small-amplitude oscillations. Moreover, the cases for bubble-bubble and bubble-wall systems are studied. The observed interaction effect on the linearized dynamics can be explained as well by a set of the RayleighâPlesset equations coupled through acoustic radiation among these systems. This suggests that this experimental setup can be applied to validate the model of bubble dynamics with more complex configuration such as a cloud of bubbles in viscoelastic materials.Â«Â less\n\nSupernova remnant evolution in wind bubbles: A closer look at Kes 27\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDwarkadas, V. V.; Dewey, D.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nMassive Stars (>8Mâ) lose mass in the form of strong winds. These winds accumulate around the star, forming wind-blown bubbles. When the star explodes as a supernova (SN), the resulting shock wave expands within this wind-blown bubble, rather than the interstellar medium. The properties of the resulting remnant, its dynamics and kinematics, the morphology, and the resulting evolution, are shaped by the structure and properties of the wind-blown bubble. In this article we focus on Kes 27, a supernova remnant (SNR) that has been proposed by [1] to be evolving in a wind-blown bubble, explore its properties, and investigate whether the X-Ray properties could be ascribed to evolution of a SNR in a wind-blown bubble. Our initial model does not support the scenario proposed by [1], due to the fact that the reflected shock is expanding into much lower densities.\n\nVenous gas embolism - Time course of residual pulmonary intravascular bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nButler, B. D.; Luehr, S.; Katz, J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA study was carried out to determine the time course of residual pulmonary intravascular bubbles after embolization with known amounts of venous air, using an N2O challenge technique. Attention was also given to the length of time that the venous gas emboli remained as discrete bubbles in the lungs with 100 percent oxygen ventilation. The data indicate that venous gas emboli can remain in the pulmonary vasculature as discrete bubbles for periods lasting up to 43 + or - 10.8 min in dogs ventilated with oxygen and nitrogen. With 100 percent oxygen ventilation, these values are reduced significantly to 19 + or - 2.5 min.\n\nEntrapment of Hydrate-coated Gas Bubbles into Oil and Separation of Gas and Hydrate-film; Seafloor Experiments with ROV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHiruta, A.; Matsumoto, R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe trapped gas bubbles emitted from the seafloor into oil-containing collector and observed an unique phenomena. Gas hydrate formation needs water for the crystal lattice; however, gas hydrates in some areas are associated with hydrophobic crude oil or asphalt. In order to understand gas hydrate growth in oil-bearing sediments, an experiment with cooking oil was made at gas hydrate stability condition. We collected venting gas bubbles into a collector with canola oil during ROV survey at a gas hydrate area in the eastern margin of the Sea of Japan. When the gas bubbles were trapped into collector with oil, gas phase appeared above the oil and gas hydrates, between oil and gas phase. At this study area within gas hydrate stability condition, control experiment with oil-free collector suggested that gas bubbles emitted from the seafloor were quickly covered with gas hydrate film. Therefore it is improbable that gas bubbles entered into the oil phase before hydrate skin formation. After the gas phase formation in oil-containing collector, the ROV floated outside of hydrate stability condition for gas hydrate dissociation and re-dived to the venting site. During the re-dive within hydrate stability condition, gas hydrate was not formed. The result suggests that moisture in the oil is not enough for hydrate formation. Therefore gas hydrates that appeared at the oil/gas phase boundary were already formed before bubbles enter into the oil. Hydrate film is the only possible origin. This observation suggests that hydrate film coating gas hydrate was broken at the sea water/oil boundary or inside oil. Further experiments may contribute for revealing kinetics of hydrate film and formation.

The dispersed bubble reactor (DBR) operates in the dispersed bubble flow regime to selectively absorb gas phase constituents into the liquid phase. The dispersion is achieved by shearing the large inlet gas bubbles into fine bubbles with circulating liquid and additional pumped liquid solvent when necessary. The DBR is capable of handling precipitates that may form during absorption or fine catalysts that may be necessary to promote liquid phase reactions. The DBR can be configured with multistage counter current flow sections by inserting concentric cylindrical sections into the risermoreÂ Â» to facilitate annular flow. While the DBR can absorb CO.sub.2 in liquid solvents that may lead to precipitates at high loadings, it is equally capable of handling many different types of chemical processes involving solids (precipitates/catalysts) along with gas and liquid phases.Â«Â less\n\nPossible high sonic velocity due to the inclusion of gas bubbles in water\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBanno, T.; Mikada, H.; Goto, T.; Takekawa, J.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nIf formation water becomes multi-phase by inclusion of gas bubbles, sonic velocities would be strongly influenced. In general, sonic velocities are knocked down due to low bulk moduli of the gas bubbles. However, sonic velocities may increase depending on the size of gas bubbles, when the bubbles in water or other media oscillate due to incoming sonic waves. Sonic waves are scattered by the bubbles and the superposition of the incoming and the scattered waves result in resonant-frequency-dependent behavior. The phase velocity of sonic waves propagating in fluids containing bubbles, therefore, probably depends on their frequencies. This is a typical phenomenon called âwave dispersion.â So far we have studied about the bubble impact on sonic velocity in bubbly media, such as the formation that contains gas bubbles. As a result, it is shown that the bubble resonance effect is a key to analyze the sonic phase velocity increase. Therefore to evaluate the resonance frequency of bubbles is important to solve the frequency response of sonic velocity in formations having bubbly fluids. There are several analytical solutions of the resonance frequency of bubbles in water. Takahira et al. (1994) derived a equation that gives us the resonance frequency considering bubble - bubble interactions. We have used this theory to calculate resonance frequency of bubbles at the previous work. However, the analytical solution of the Takahiraâs equation is based on several assumptions. Therefore we used a numerical approach to calculate the bubble resonance effect more precisely in the present study. We used the boundary element method (BEM) to reproduce a bubble oscillation in incompressible liquid. There are several reasons to apply the BEM. Firstly, it arrows us to model arbitrarily sets and shapes of bubbles. Secondly, it is easy to use the BEM to reproduce a boundary-surface between liquid and gas. The velocity potential of liquid surrounding a bubble satisfies the Laplace\n\nGas bubbles in marine mud-How small are they?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReed, Allen H.; Briggs, Kevin B.\n\n2003-10-01\n\nFree gas in marine mud poses a challenging problem in the realm of ocean acoustics as it readily attenuates (i.e., scatters or absorbs) energy, such that objects lying below the gassy sediment are acoustically masked. Gas-laden sediments were located in 10- to 120-m water depth adjacent to the South Pass of the Mississippi River in East Bay using a 12-kHz transducer and the Acoustic Sediment Classification System. Several cores were collected in this region for physical property measurements. Some of the cores were x-rayed on medical and industrial computed tomography (CT) scanners. Volumetric CT images were used to locate gas bubbles, determine shapes and sizes to within the limits of the CT resolution. Free gas in the East Bay sediments was relegated to worm tubes as well as isolated pockets as was the case in EckernfÃ¶rde Bay sediments [Abegg and Anderson, Mar. Geol. 137, 137-147 (1997)]. The primary significance of the present work is that gas bubbles have been determined to exist in the tens of Î¼m size range, which is significantly smaller than the smallest bubbles that were previously resolved with medical CT (~440 Î¼m) with NRL's HD-500 micro-CT System.

In areas where volatile organic contaminants discharge from ground water, through the bottom sediment, and into the creek, part of the volatile contamination diffuses into the gas bubbles and is released to the atmosphere by ebullition. Collection and analysis of gas bubbles for their volatile organic contaminant content indicate that relative concentrations of the volatile organic contaminants in the gas bubbles are substantially higher in areas where the same contaminants occur in the ground water that discharges to the streams. Analyses of the bubbles located an area of previously unknown ground-water contamination. The method developed for this study consisted of disturbing the bottom sediment to release gas bubbles, and then capturing the bubbles in a polyethylene bag at the water-column surface. The captured gas was transferred either into sealable polyethylene bags for immediate analysis with a photoionization detector or by syringe to glass tubes containing wires coated with an activated-carbon adsorbent. Relative concentrations were determined by mass spectral analysis for chloroform and trichloroethylene.\n\nRegimes of Micro-bubble Formation Using Gas Injection into Ladle Shroud\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, Sheng; Cao, Xiangkun; Zou, Zongshu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nGas injection into a ladle shroud is a practical approach to produce micro-bubbles in tundishes, to promote inclusion removal from liquid steel.

The missing link between intracellular CO(2) production by glycolysis and eventual CO(2) release from cells has therefore been resolved. Yeasts may serve as model to study CO(2) behavior under pressurized conditions that may impact on fermentation biotechnology. Â© 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The state of gas bubble nuclei in water is critical to the determination of a cavitation inception threshold. Under ultrasound forcing, the size of bubble nuclei is varied by the transfer of dissolved gas (i.e., rectified diffusion); the growth rate will be promoted by the supersaturation and is thus expected to contribute to cavitation activity enhancement.
