        "text": "Piezoelectric PVDF sensors offer a unique option for the measurement of cavitation aggressiveness represented by the magnitude of impacts due to cavitation bubble collapses near walls. The aggressiveness measurement requires specific sensor shape and area, whereas commercial PVDF sensors are fabricated in limited geometry and size ranges. The photolithography method offers a possibility of production of home-made PVDF sensors of arbitrary shape and size. The methodology of a unique application of the standard photolithography method, which is commonly used for the production of printed circuit boards, is described in this paper. It enables mass production of high quality sensors contrary to laboratory techniques. This paper deals with the fabrication and the calibration of a photolithographically home-made PVDF sensor for the cavitation impact load measurement. The calibration of sensors was carried out by the ball drop method. Sensors of different sizes were fabricated by the photo...\n\nThe erosion produced by cavitation is a serious problem in hydraulic machinery. During investigations of the dynamic loading generated by collapsing cavitation on a surface, a dynamic pressure transducer was developed. The piezoelectric polymer PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) was used as the pressure sensitive material. A novel method of dynamic calibration has also been developed. The transducer is loaded through pencil lead by a beam supported at its other end on a knife edge and loaded at the center by weights. As the static load is increased, the pencil lead breaks and the load is released suddenly. The unloading time is faster than for any other conventional calibration method and is of the same order as cavitation loading. Descriptions of the developments of both the calibration method and the transducer are given. The principal advantages of the new method are the short pulse duration and the simplicity of the test procedure. The paper is an extension of the previously reporte...\n\nThe first and main part of this work presents the design, development and operation of a Cavitation Susceptibility Meter based on the use of a venturi tube for the measurement of the content of active cavitation nuclei in water samples. The pressure at the venturi throat is determined from the upstream pressure and the local flow velocity without corrections for viscous effects because the flow possesses a laminar potential core in all operational conditions. The detection of cavitation and the measurement of the flow velocity are carried out optically. The apparatus comprises a Laser Doppler Velocimeter for the measurement of the flow velocity and the detection of cavitation, a custom-made electronic Signal Processor for real time generation and temporary storage of the data and a computerized system for the final acquisition and reduction of the collected data. The various steps and considerations leading to the present design concept are discussed in detail and the implementation..."
