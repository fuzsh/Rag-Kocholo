For those of you that will need the distribution requirements the lists are here: critical race feminisms, sexuality studies, transnational feminisms. For questions, contact the undergraduate advisor.\n\nWGSS 187 – Gender, Sexuality and Culture\n\nMonday, Wednesday 10:10-11:00 a.m.\n\nFriday discussions 9:05, 10:10, 11:15 and 12:20\n\nKiran Asher\n\nThis course offers an introduction to some of the basic concepts and theoretical perspectives in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies. Drawing on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural studies, students will engage critically with issues such as gender inequities, sexuality, families, work, media images, queer issues, masculinity, reproductive rights, and history. Throughout the course, students will explore how experiences of gender and sexuality intersect with other social constructs of difference, including race/ethnicity, class, and age. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which interlocking systems of oppression have shaped and influenced the historical, cultural, social, political, and economical contexts of our lives, and the social movements at the local, national and transnational levels which have led to key transformations. (Gen. Ed. I, DU)\n\nWGSS 201 – Gender and Difference: Critical Analyses\n\nSection #1 Tuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m. – Rachel Briggs\n\nSection #2 Tuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m. – Miliann Kang\n\nAn introduction to the vibrant field of women, gender, and sexuality studies, this course familiarizes students with the basic concepts in the field and draws connections to the world in which we live. An interdisciplinary field grounded in commitment to both intellectual rigor and individual and social transformation, WGSS asks fundamental questions about the conceptual and material conditions of our lives. What are “gender,” “sexuality,” “race,” and “class?” How are gender categories, in particular, constructed differently across social groups, nations, and historical periods? What are the connections between gender and socio-political categories such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, (dis)ability and others? How do power structures such as sexism, racism, heterosexism, and classism and others intersect? How can an understanding of gender and power enable us to act as agents of individual and social change? Emphasizing inquiry in transnational feminisms, critical race feminisms, and sexuality studies, this course examines gender within a broad nexus of identity categories, social positions, and power structures. Areas of focus may include queer and trans studies; feminist literatures and cultures; feminist science studies; reproductive politics; gender, labor and feminist economics, environmental and climate justice; the politics of desire, and others. Readings include a range of queer, feminist and women thinkers from around the world, reflecting diverse and interdisciplinary perspectives in the field.\n\nWGSS 230 – Politics of Reproduction\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nLaura Briggs\n\nFrom the Black Panther Party and Young Lords in the 1970s to SisterSong and Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice in the 1990s to Ferguson and Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement in the present, communities of color and socialist feminists have fought for a comprehensive reproductive freedom platform--birth control and abortion to be sure, but also the right to raise wanted children that are safe, cherished, and educated. The names of these issues have included freedom from sterilization, high quality affordable day care, IVF, immigrant justice, social reproduction and wages for housework, welfare and neoliberalism, foreclosure and affordable housing.\n\nWGSS 290B – Introduction to Sexuality Studies: Movements for Justice in the Contemporary World (DG, SB)\n\nMonday, Wednesday 11:15-12:05 p.m.\n\nFriday discussions 12:20 and 1:25\n\nSvati Shah\n\nThis interdisciplinary course will help students to understand what the term \"sexuality studies\" means by providing a foundation in the key concepts, historical and social contexts, topics, and politics that inform the fields of sexuality studies; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender studies; and queer studies. Course instruction will be carried out through readings, lectures, films, and discussions, as well as individual and group assignments. Over the course of the semester, students will develop and use critical thinking skills to discern how \"sexuality\" becomes consolidated as a distinct category of analysis in the late nineteenth century, and what it means to speak about sexuality and transgender politics and categories today. Topics will include queer theories and politics, trans theories and politics, LGBTQ social movements within and outside of the US, relationships with feminist reproductive justice movements, heterosexuality, homophobia, and HIV/AIDS and health discourses. The range of materials covered will prioritize developing analyses that examine the interplay between sexuality and class, gender, race, ethnicity, and neoliberalism. (Gen. Ed. SB, DG)\n\nWGSS 290C – History of Sexuality and Race in the U.S.\n\nUWW Section – Kirsten Leng\n\nSection 1 – Tuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m. – Kirsten Leng\n\nSection 2 – Monday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m. – Derek Siegel\n\nThis course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary feminist study of sexuality. Its primary goal is to provide a forum for students to consider the history of sexuality and race in the U.S. both in terms of theoretical frameworks within women's and gender studies, and in terms of a range of sites where those theoretical approaches become material, are negotiated, or are shifted. The course is a fully interdisciplinary innovation. It will emphasize the links rather than differences between theory and practice and between cultural, material, and historical approaches to the body, gender, and sexuality. Throughout the course we will consider contemporary sexual politics \"from the science of sex and sexuality to marriage debates\" in light of histories of racial and sexual formations. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nWGSS 292S - Damsels in Distress and Heroes: Issues of Representations in Film\n\nWednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nRachel Briggs\n\nThis course will examine representations of damsels in distress and heroes in cinema. We will screen a wide variety of films, mostly mainstream Hollywood movies since the 1970s, including Thelma and Louise, Set it Off, and Jordan Peele?s Us. Course content will use feminist theories to explore and critique how race and gender work to construct both the damsel and the hero in cinematic representations. We will view and analyze films that construct white femininity as vulnerable and in need of protection, often from villains that are problematically depicted as ?other? and dangerous. Films that complicate narratives of the hero and the damsel will be viewed to explore ways in which our ideas of heroes, damsels, and narratives are constrained by generic categories prevalent in film?particularly in mainstream movies. We will interrogate the figure of the hero in relation to an ideology of individualism prevalent in U.S. neoliberalism and examine how narratives might depict characters that instead work in collective to create change.\n\nWGSS 293D – Public Health/Private Decisions: Ethics and Medicine\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nBanu Subramaniam/Karen Lederer\n\nThe field of medicine is shaped by both private and public dimensions. At the individual level, we are assured of privacy through HIPAA, and decisions on our individual health cannot be made without our consent. But there are also larger public dimensions to health that impinge on our individual and collective wellness. For example, if an individual chooses not to vaccinate themselves, that impacts the larger health of the public. What are the public costs and consequences of enacting or not enacting such rules? What are our public health and social obligations vs. our private needs and preferences? Using the tools of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies, the course investigates the real life practices and dilemmas in medicine and the U.S. health care system. What ethical and professional guidelines do or don't or should doctors follow? How much authority should governments (state, local or federal) have to control actions for example in quarantines, reallocation of resources, and other questions. How should health care costs be regulated? What is and should be the role of industry and profit in producing medical products? Should governments be involved in production? Some of the issues explored include: the politics of health care, epidemics and pandemics, medicalization of childbirth, dr/patient confidentiality, categories of race, sex, and sexuality in medicine, disability, genetic testing, abortion, organ transplants, vaccination, euthanasia and more.\n\nWGSS 293J/COMP-LIT 293J - Gender and Global Literatures\n\nTuesday, Thursday 4:00-5:15 p.m\n\nSandra Russell\n\nUsing the prisms of gender and sexuality studies, this course explores how \"desire\" is represented in global literatures. Adopting a comparative perspective, the course will examine representations of gendered, racialized, and sexualized bodies in contemporary works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and criticism. We will look at both the “local,” in the United States, and the “global,” in transnational contexts, including literatures from East/Central Europe and the Global South. The course will also explore how bodies and their literary representations shape and are shaped by our imaginings about nation, citizenship, and belonging. Authors may include, Audre Lorde, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Oksana Zabuzhko, Mariama Bâ, Carmen Maris Machado, Dubravka Ugrešić, among others.\n\nWGSS 301 – Theorizing Gender, Race and Power\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m\n\nLaura Briggs\n\nWays of analyzing and reflecting on current issues and controversies in feminist thought within an international context sensitive to class, race, and sexual power concerns. Topics may include work and international economic development, violence against women, racism, class and poverty, heterosexism, the social construction of gender, race and sexuality, global feminism, women, nationalism and the state, reproductive issues, pornography and media representations of women.\n\nWGSS 310 – Writing for Majors\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45\n\nRachel Briggs\n\nFulfills Junior Year Writing requirement for majors. Modes of writing and argumentation useful for research, creative, and professional work in a variety of fields. Analysis of texts, organization of knowledge, and uses of evidence to articulate ideas to diverse audiences. Includes materials appropriate for popular and scholarly journal writing. Popular culture reviews, responses to public arguments, monographs, first-person narratives and grant proposals, and a section on archival and bibliographic resources in Women's Studies. May include writing for the Internet. Nonmajors admitted if space available. You must have fulfilled your CW Gen. Ed. requirement to enroll in this course.\n\nWGSS 391A – Rape and Representation\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nLaura Ciolkowski\n\nRebecca Solnit has written, \"Liberation is always in part a storytelling process: breaking stories, breaking silences, making new stories. A free person tells her own story. A valued person lives in a society in which her story has a place.\" This course approaches the study of rape and other forms of gender-based violence with particular attention to storytelling, narrative, and the politics of representation. Our focus will be on the representation, politicization and theorization of violence through the interdisciplinary and intersectional lens of social justice feminism, gender and sexuality studies, and critical race theory. We will explore literary, artistic, legal, and activist efforts to interpret and address violence and, ultimately, to re-imagine and re-build the world otherwise; and we will interrogate the politics of silence and speech and the act of witnessing and testimony in the long history of organizing against sexual violence by a wide variety of actors, including people of color, incarcerated people, gender non-conforming people, enslaved, and undocumented people. Course materials will include fiction, poetry, and memoir, along with readings in law, trauma theory, carceral studies, reproductive health, rights and justice, and media studies.\n\nWGSS 392J/692J – Feminisms and Environmental Justice\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nKiran Asher\n\nWhile feminism and environmental justice are both political projects of social change, their objects or objectives are not the same. As we sink into the 21st century, amid looming fears of ecological catastrophes and socio-economic crises, is a conversation between these two projects likely to be productive for both struggles, or are their goals at odds with each other? This class will examine the perceived, existing, and potential links (or disjuncts) between feminism and environmental justice. Our interdisciplinary inquiry will be guided by questions such as: What is understood by the terms \"feminism\" and \"environmental justice\"? How have nature and the environment figured in feminist writings and feminist ideas of justice? Conversely, how do women and gender figure in ideas and struggles for environmental justice? Indeed, how do feminist ideals inform (or not) other struggles for social change (such as those of peasants, workers, ethnic groups, queer folk, and more)?\n\nWGSS 392T/ENGLISH 392T - Reading Transgender\n\nMonday, Wednesday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nJoy Hayward-Jansen\n\nFrom newspaper chronicles of nineteenth-century gender outlaws to the present-day explosion of transgender poetry, our personal, cultural, and political understandings of gender nonconformity in the United States have long been tied to particular modes of representation. Through sustained engagement with such creative work, as well as background reading in transgender history and theory, this course will explore the literary history of trans. Although we will pull material from across time and genre, we will focus on contemporary writers like Janet Mock and Joshua Jennifer Espinoza. Together, we will ask questions about authorship; the relationship between social conditions and representational strategies; the possibilities and limitations of different genres; and, ultimately, what makes literature \"trans.\"\n\nWGSS 395J – Imagining Justice\n\nTuesday 6:00-8:30 p.m.\n\nLaura Ciolkowski\n\nThis course was designed to be conducted inside the Hampshire County Jail and House of Corrections in Northampton, enrolling an equal number of students from UMass and students who are incarcerated in the facility. Due to the ongoing health concerns both inside the jail and in the UMass community, however, the course has been changed to a fully remote format and may include incarcerated students only if the jail is able to accommodate distance learning this semester.\n\nThis course is an interdisciplinary exploration of the critical, aspirational, artistic, and creative forms that Justice takes in literature and the humanities more broadly. What sorts of ethical, social, and political questions are animated by writers and thinkers who seek to imagine and build a different world? What are the tangled roots of inequality and the legacies of sexual, racial, and economic injustice? How do writers, poets, artists, and “freedom dreamers,” as Robin D.G. Kelley so memorably called them, labor to expose injustice and re-invent our universe? Ursula Le Guin has written, “We will not know our own injustice if we cannot imagine justice. We will not be free if we do not imagine freedom. We cannot demand that anyone try to attain justice and freedom who has not had a chance to imagine them as attainable.” Taking Le Guin’s focus on the radical imagination as a starting point, this course explores the relationship between literature, the arts, and a wide range of social justice projects. Topics will include: Afrofuturism; utopian and dystopian fiction; art and social justice; bioethics and literature; prison writing, poetry, and the literature of restorative and transformative justice; diaspora studies and literary and artistic representations of movement, forced migration and displacement.\n\nWGSS 492G/692G – Gender and U.S. Empire\n\nThursday 2:30-5:00 p.m.\n\nLaura Briggs\n\nThere is an old debate among historians of the United States over whether to consider the US an empire; the answer turns, basically, on how you define ?empire.? This course is not very interested in that question. Rather, it begins with the problem of how to collapse two very different faces of the analysis of US imperialism. One is public/boy/policy/official: the military, diplomacy, NGOs, and medicine and science. The other is private/girl/racialized/marginal: questions of gender, children, race, indigeneity, sexuality. The course, asks, then: how has the United States gained influence globally through settler colonialism, territorial government, military interventions, counterinsurgency, the rule of experts, military bases, and U.S. global markets? What is the relationship of enslavement and debt in the context of the Americas? How have scholars in a variety of fields, including particularly history, anthropology, and interdisciplinary queer, feminist, ethnic, and American Studies, shed light on how gender, racialization, and sexuality are configured and reconfigured in relationship to US empire? This seminar will be reading-intensive.\n\nWGSS 493W/693W (also ANTHRO 693W) - Worlds of Migration\n\nWednesday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nSvati Shah\n\nThis seminar takes an expansive view of migration, beginning with readings from archaeology, physical anthropology and antiquity, all of which show that humans have always traveled great distances, for resources, because of climate disturbances, and for reasons that are yet to be understood. Indeed, migration has been a consistent feature and `producer? of human existence. Taking human migration as the norm rather than the exception, we will examine when, how and why `nativism? and reactionary discourses of ethnic and racialized citizenship began imagining a different view of migration to the one we find in the records of human history. Readings on contemporary migration will focus on India, South Africa, Greece, Australia and the US, all of which have had intense debates on questions of nation, sexuality, race and labor in recent years. Theoretically, we will rely on critiques of migration that emphasize temporality, political economy and postcoloniality, especially with respect to understanding borders and how they are surveilled and enforced. Our readings and discussions will expand the terrain of what counts as `migration?, why certain forms of human movement across great distances are not thought of as `migration? at all, and why legal and policy debates around the world tend to focus on cross-border migration, often at the expense of equally important discussions of domestic, `circular? and seasonal migrations that people everywhere undertake as a means of survival.\n\nWGSS 791B – Feminist Theory\n\nTuesday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nFumi Okiji\n\nThis graduate seminar in feminist theory constitutes a core course for students enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Advanced Feminist Studies. The seminar will be organized around questions that emerge for feminisms from the rubrics of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, transnationalism, human rights, economics and postcolonialism. Feminist theory is inherently interdisciplinary and we will draw on classic and contemporary writings from the many fields that contribute to the \"field.\"\n\nWGSS 692G/492G – Gender and U.S. Empire\n\nThursday 2:30-5:00 p.m.\n\nLaura Briggs\n\nThere is an old debate among historians of the United States over whether to consider the US an empire; the answer turns, basically, on how you define ?empire.?

How have scholars in a variety of fields, including particularly history, anthropology, and interdisciplinary queer, feminist, ethnic, and American Studies, shed light on how gender, racialization, and sexuality are configured and reconfigured in relationship to US empire? This seminar will be reading-intensive.\n\nWGSS 692J/392J – Feminisms and Environmental Justice\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nKiran Asher\n\nWhile feminism and environmental justice are both political projects of social change, their objects or objectives are not the same.

It pays special attention to intraracial relationships among African Americans in the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements and beyond; but it also considers interracial relationships; sexual violence; reproduction and reproductive rights; childrearing and family; pleasure, happiness, and desire; pornography (or more broadly, the commodification and exploitation of black bodies); autonomy and property; and disease and medicine. As we interrogate these topics, we will investigate the political, economic, and social drivers of the aforementioned and their implications on black experiences.\n\nANTHRO 205 – Power and Inequality in the United States\n\nMonday, Wednesday 11:15-12:05 p.m.\n\nDiscussions Wednesday and Friday\n\nJennifer Sandler\n\nThe roots of racism and sexism and the issues they raise. The cultural, biological, and social contexts of race and gender and examination of biological variation, genetic determinism, human adaptation, and the bases of human behavior. (Gen Ed SB, DU)\n\nART-HIS 397R/697R – Women in Architecture\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 p.m.\n\nMargaret Vickery\n\nThis course begins with an examination of gendered, architectural spaces and how and why they were structured for women in the 19th century in both Britain and America. Looking at primary and secondary sources, students will gain insight into societal norms and how they conditioned architecture generally associated with women, such as houses, asylums, and early women's colleges. This study will serve as a platform from which to understand the pressures upon women and the pioneers who rejected such norms and pursued architecture as a profession. The latter half of the course will look at the work of early women architects, the hurdles they faced and the examples they set. The course will conclude with a critical examination of women architects practicing today and how they navigate the profession.\n\nCHINESE 394WI – Women in Chinese Cultures\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 p.m.\n\nElena Chiu\n\nThis course focuses on the representation of women and the constitution of gender in Chinese culture as seen through literature and mass media. It focuses on literary and visual representations of women to examine important issues such as the relationship between gender and power, self and society, and tradition and modernity. This course has a dual goal: to explore how women's social role has evolved from pre-modern China to the present and to examine important issues such as women's agency, \"inner-outer\" division, and the yin-yang dichotomy in Chinese literature and culture. Satisfies the Integrative Experience requirement for BA-Chinse majors.\n\nCLASSICS 335 – Women in Antiquity\n\nTuesday, Thursday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nTBD Lauren Caldwell\n\nLives, roles, contributions, and status of women in Greek and Roman societies, as reflected in classical literature and the archaeological record. (Gen.Ed. HS)\n\nCOMM 288 – Gender, Sex and Representation\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nSut Jhally\n\nThis course will examine the relationship between commercialized systems of representation and the way that gender and sexuality are thought of and organized in the culture. In particular, we will look at how commercial imagery impacts upon gender identity and the process of gender socialization. Central to this discussion will be the related issues of sexuality and sexual representation (and the key role played by advertising). Students can register for the in-person lecture version or the online lecture version. The in-person lectures will be available a day later to watch online. Exams for all students will take place in person three times during the semester.\n\nCOMM 497QP – Queer Performance and Publics\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nKimberlee Perez\n\nThe culture and legislature of the United States shape discourses that produce the rights, recognitions, relations, im/mobilities, in/visibility, and mis/understandings of LGBTQIA persons and groups. In the context of history and from various social positions, these changes are read and enacted in multiple ways. This course considers the ways LGBTQIA persons and groups use performance, on the stage and in everyday life, as a form of communication, as communicative strategies that generate dialogue, resistance, and social action in order to more fully participate in mainstream publics as well as create counterpublics and queer world-making.\n\nECON 347 – Economics of LGBT Issues\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nLee Badgett\n\nThe economic, social, and legal position of LGBT people has changed very rapidly in the U.S. This course focuses on how policy change happened and whether and why LGBT people still face economic inequality. This course explores that position from the perspective of economics, politics, and policy, primarily in the U.S., but also in other regions of the world. Major questions addressed include: What was the role of the economy and political factors in shaping LGBT identities and social movements? What factors made the LGBT social movement successful? What are the remaining sources of legal inequality? What causes employment discrimination against LGBT people? Does the state of the economy affect anti-LGBT prejudice and political change? Are LGBT families different? Why and how? Do public policies reduce economic inequality for LGBT people? What kinds of economic inequalities do LGBT people still face? What has been the role of business in supporting LGBT equality? How do businesses gain from LGBT equality? How does economic development contribute to LGBT equality and vice versa in other parts of the world?\n\nECON 348 – Political Economy of Women\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nLisa Saunders\n\nA critical review of neoclassical, Marxist, and feminist economic theories pertaining to inequality between men and women in both the family and the firm. Open to students whose primary major is ECON, RES-ECON, STPEC, or MANAGECON. Prerequisite: ECON 103 or RES-ECON 102 Open only to Econ/STPEC/ResEc/MANAGECON primary majors until after juniors enroll.\n\nENGLISH 132 – Gender, Sexuality, Literature, and Culture\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 11:15-12:05 p.m. – TBD Angela Rain Kim\n\nMonday, Wednesday 12:20-1:10 p.m. – TBD Tyler Smart\n\nLiterature treating the relationship between man and woman. Topics may include: the nature of love, the image of the hero and heroine, and definitions, past and present, of the masculine and feminine. (Gen. Ed. AL, DG)\n\nENGLISH 378 - Amerian Women Writers\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 9:05-9:55 a.m.\n\nGloria Biamonte\n\nFiction by women exploring the social and sexul arrangements of American culture.\n\nGERMAN 363 – Witches: Myth and Reality\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 1:25-2:15 p.m.\n\nKerstin Mueller Dembling\n\nThis course focuses on various aspects of witches/witchcraft in order to examine the historical construction of the witch in the context of the social realities of women (and men) labeled as witches. The main areas covered are: European pagan religions and the spread of Christianity; the \"Burning Times\" in early modern Europe, with an emphasis on the German situation; 17th-century New England and the Salem witch trials; the images of witches in folk lore and fairy tales in the context of the historical persecutions; and contemporary Wiccan/witch practices in their historical context. The goal of the course is to deconstruct the stereotypes that many of us have about witches/witchcraft, especially concerning sexuality, gender, age, physical appearance, occult powers, and Satanism. Readings are drawn from documentary records of the witch persecutions and witch trials, literary representations, scholarly analyses of witch-related phenomena, and essays examining witches, witchcraft, and the witch persecutions from a contemporary feminist or neo-pagan perspective. The lectures will be supplemented by related material taken from current events in addition to visual material (videos, slides) drawn from art history, early modern witch literature, popular culture, and documentary sources. Conducted in English. (Gen Ed. I, DG)\n\nHISTORY 297WL/LEGAL 297WL – Women and the Law\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nJennifer Nye\n\nThis course examines the legal status of women in the United States, focusing specifically on the 20th and 21st centuries. How has the law used gender, sex, sexuality, and race to legally enforce inequality between women and men (and among women)? We will examine the legal arguments feminists have used to advocate for legal change and how these arguments have changed over time, paying specific attention to debates about whether to make legal arguments based on formal equality, substantive equality, liberty, or privacy. We will also consider the pros and cons of using the law to advocate for social justice. Specific issues that may be covered include the civil and political participation of women (voting, jury service), employment discrimination, intimate relationships, reproduction, contraception and abortion, violence against women, women as criminal defendants, and women as law students, lawyers, and judges.\n\nHISTORY 349H – Sex and Society\n\nMonday, Wednesday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nJennifer Heuer\n\nThis honors course examines the social organization and cultural construction of gender and sexuality. We will look at how women and men experienced the dramatic changes that have affected Europe since 1789 and consider how much these developments were themselves influenced by ideas about masculinity and femininity. We will explore topics such as revolutionary definitions of citizenship; changing patterns of work and family life; fin-de-siecle links between crime, madness, and sexual perversion; the fascist cult of the body; battle grounds and home fronts during the world wars; gendered aspects of nationalism and European colonialism, and the sexual revolution of the post-war era.\n\nHISTORY 389 – U.S. Women’s History Since 1890\n\nTuesday, Thursday 5:30-6:45 p.m.\n\nAdeline Broussan\n\nExplores the relationship of women to the social, cultural, economic and political developments shaping American society from 1890 to the present. Examines women's paid and unpaid labor, family life and sexuality, feminist movements and women's consciousness; emphasis on how class, race, ethnicity, and sexual choice have affected women's historical experience. Sophomore level and above. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nHISTORY 397REH – Race, Sex, and Empire: Britain and India\n\nMonday, Wednesday 4:00-5:15 p.m\n\nPriyanka Srivastava\n\nImperialism cannot be understood merely as an economic-military-territorial system of control and exploitation. Cultural domination is integral to any sustained system of global exploitation. Focusing on cultural aspects of imperialism, this course explores the racial and sexual politics of British Empire in India from the late eighteenth to early twentieth century. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources as well as visual and literary material the course will examine how socially constructed racial and gendered hierarchies, and myths about the sexual practices of colonized people were linked to the pursuit and maintenance of imperial rule over India. Simultaneously, we will consider how the complex intersection of race, sexuality, and class influenced the political and social cultures of both Britain (the metropole) and India (the colony). We will analyze key scholarly perspectives on the following: forms of colonial knowledge, theories of Aryanism, colonial masculinities, regulation of sexual behavior and prostitution, and the varying roles of colonial institutions, medical practices, popular discourses, and cultural artifacts in producing racial and sexual stereotypes and in creating distinctions between the colonizers and the colonized.\n\nHISTORY 397RL – Rape Law: Gender, Race, (In)justice\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nJennifer Nye\n\nThe history of the legal response to rape has often resulted in injustice for both the victim/survivor and the alleged perpetrator. This course will examine the evolution of the U.S. legal system's treatment of rape, paying particular attention to the movement against lynching in the post-civil war era, the rise of the feminist anti-rape movement in the 1970s and the student movement against campus sexual assault. Through an analysis of court cases, legislation, and other texts we will consider the role sexual violence has played in maintaining gender and racialized power relationships. We will examine how and why such violence came to be seen as a crime, including who is worthy of the law's \"protection\" and who is subject to the law's “punishment.\" We will explore issues such as: rape as a form of racialized and imperial violence, especially against black and Native American women; the criminal legal treatment of rape and the evolution of the legal concepts of force, resistance, and consent; and the civil responses to rape under the Violence Against Women Act and Title IX. We'll also look at the international law responses to rape as a weapon of war. Finally, we'll think about how the legal responses, or non-responses, to rape have differed over time depending on factors such as the race/ethnicity, income level, immigration status, sexual orientation/gender identity, age, and marital status of the victim/survivor and the perpetrator. Finally, we’ll consider how the legal system can or should respond to rape, particularly in this age of mass criminalization and mass incarceration, and whether restorative justice responses might be preferable. Prior law-related coursework is helpful, but not required.\n\nHONORS 499CN – Women Organize/Better World\n\nTuesday, Thursday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nGraciela Monteagudo\n\nThroughout the planet, women create common spaces for a better world in response to threats to their livelihood. This course uses the concept “woman” to refer to bodies feminized by power, to include both transgender and cis women. Students will analyze the axis of oppression and resistance that sit at the core of women’s experiences. Focusing on gender, sexuality, the economy, and ethnic/racial oppression will help students zero on the structural aspect of women’s organizing. Students will prepare to write their thesis by learning about a wide range of movements, such as movements against gender violence, against racism, for access to full reproductive rights, for living wages, and to de-naturalize domestic work’s hidden unpaid labor.\n\nJAPANESE 391S/591S – Women Writers of Japan\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nAmanda Seaman\n\nSee department for description.\n\nJAPANESE 391M/591M – Queer Japan in Literature and Culture\n\nTuesday, Thursday 5:30-6:45 p.m.\n\nStephen Miller\n\nSee department for description.\n\nJUDAIC 383/WGSS 391D – Women, Gender, Judaism\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nSusan Shapiro\n\nHistorically, the figure of the \"Jew\" has been thought of as male. Making male experience normative has in turn shaped how Judaism itself has been understood. Shifting the basic terms and focus to include attention to women, gender, and sexuality significantly re-shapes our understanding of both Judaism and of Jewish culture/history. This course not only \"fills in the blanks\" of the missing women of Jewish history and tradition, but attends to questions of contemporary forms of Jewish women's and men's gendered lives, identities and sexualities. Beginning with the Bible, the course proceeds historically, concluding with contemporary views of and debates surrounding matters of gender and sexuality.\n\nPHIL 371 – Philosophical Perspectives on Gender\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nLouise Antony\n\nThis course will offer systematic examination of a variety of philosophical issues raised by the existence of gender roles in human society: Is the existence or content of such roles determined by nature? Are they inherently oppressive? How does the category gender interact with other socially significant categories, like race, class, and sexual orientation? What would gender equality look like? How do differences among women complicate attempts to generalize about gender? In the last part of the course, we will bring our theoretical insights to bear on some topical issue related to gender, chosen by the class, such as: Is affirmative action morally justifiable? Should pornography be regulated? Is abortion morally permissible? Reading will be drawn from historical and contemporary sources. Methods of analytical philosophy, particularly the construction and critical evaluation of arguments, will be emphasized throughout. (Gen. Ed. SB)\n\nPOLISCI 392AP – Activism, Participation and Protest\n\nWednesday 2:30-5:00 p.m.\n\nSonia Alvarez\n\nThis course examines contemporary forms of political activism, participation, and protest. Drawing on select case studies, principally from Latin America, the U.S, and Europe, we will pay particular attention to the dynamic development of feminisms, anti-racist/Black mobilizations, anti-austerity and pro-democracy protests, and LGBTQ organizing.\n\nPOLSCI 395F – Women and Politics\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nSarah Tanzi\n\nWomen have made tremendous gains in every aspect of social, economic and political life in the United States, particularly since the second wave of the women's movement in the 1960s. Yet, women's progress in terms of achieving elected office has reached a puzzling plateau since the 1990s. We will examine the course of women's movements towards achieving political incorporation in the United States. We consider the debate over why women's political progress has stagnated and we consider the impact of the gender imbalance in American electoral politics - to what extent do these disparities matter? We begin by exploring women's suffrage campaigns and voting behavior in the period immediately following their achievement of the right to vote and beyond. We then turn to the relationship between women and party politics before discussing the challenges women face as candidates in American politics. We will focus on understanding why women remain underrepresented as legislators. We then consider the extent to which women's participation in campaigns and elections makes a substantive difference in policy making.\n\nPSYCH 391ZZ – Psychology of the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Experience\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 11:15-12:05\n\nJohn Bickford\n\nStudents in this course will explore psychological theory and research pertaining to gay, lesbian, and bisexual people.

Topics covered include causes of maternal and infant mortality, treatment of malaria in pregnancy, HIV and pregnancy, infant nutrition, maternal and child nutrition, gender roles, and cultural and religious concepts in relation to working in a global setting. This course will explore approaches to public health programming that acknowledge and incorporate cultural differences.\n\nSOC 106 – Race, Gender, Class and Ethnicity\n\nSociety RAP Section in Moore Hall\n\nKelly Giles\n\nIntroduction to Sociology. Analysis of the consequences of membership in racial, gender, class and ethnic groups on social, economic and political life. (Gen.Ed. SB, DU)\n\nOpen to first year Exploring Society RAP students in Moore Hall. http://www.umass.edu/rap/exploring-society-rap\n\nStudents in Exploring Society RAP in Moore Hall will enroll together in \"Race, Gender, Class and Ethnicity\" (Sociology 106). In this class, we will examine how sociologists study social inequalities related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality. (1) We will begin by exploring how these identities are experienced in people's everyday lives. (2) Next, we will examine how these identities are constructed and maintained within our dominant institutions from families, schools, and workplaces, to media and the state. (3) We will end the course by considering creative solutions that work to end social inequalities as seen through resistance and social change efforts. Besides thinking sociologically about the world around you through engaging with foundational and cutting edge sociological research and theory, you will take part in interactive lectures, class discussions and group work with your peers. This course is designed to be useful for your success in college by developing your critical thinking, writing, researching, and speaking skills. It will also be of interest to those concerned with social justice efforts, and who wish to discuss ways of creating positive social change.\n\nSOC 106 – Race, Gender, Class and Ethnicity\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nC.N.

The course will encompass issues of race, gender, sexuality, and historical and literacy contexts of important narratives, which may include those of Olaudah Equiano, Nat Turner, Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, and Harriet Jacobs, as well as modern and contemporary narratives influenced by the genre.\n\nAFROAM 297B – Black Workers in the U.S.\n\nWednesday 6:00-8:30 p.m.\n\nJohn Bracey\n\nThis seminar will attempt to accomplish two goals; to examine some of the significant issues in the history of African American workers since Emancipation and to introduce you to some of the most recent scholarship addressing those issues. We will begin with general studies of the history of capitalism in the U.S. and Black workers then proceed to a study of 1) The role of Black labor in several industries, 2) Black women as workers 3) Black labor and the Black power movement and 4) Herbert Hill's critiques of organized labor and the labor history establishment.\n\nAFROAM 391L – Soul, Country and the USA\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nStephanie Shonekan\n\nSoul and country are musical genres that are unmistakably and proudly native to the United States. However, they often appear to be poles apart in terms of their audiences, aesthetics, messages, and most importantly how they communicate the notion of what it is to be an American. In this class, students will be inspired to think critically about the impact and significance of American popular music generally. More specifically, students will focus on how soul and country music are rooted in the history, culture and identity of the people who create and \"consume\" them. Students will study the evolution and aesthetics of these genres and will interrogate how they deal with concepts like identity, class, race, religion, and ethnicity; gender and sexuality; politics and patriotism.\n\nANTHRO 258 – Food and Culture\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m.\n\nTBD Dana Conzo\n\nThis course surveys how cultural anthropologists have studied the big questions about food and culture. How and why do people restrict what foods are considered \"edible\" or morally acceptable? How is food processed and prepared, and what does food tell us about other aspects of culture like gender and ethnic identity? How have power issues of gender, class, and colonialism shaped people's access to food? How has industrialization changed food, and where are foodways headed in the future? Along the way, students will read and see films about foodways in Europe, Africa, Asia, the United States, and Latin America. (Gen. Ed. SB, DG)\n\nART-HIS 324/624 – Modern Art, 1880-present\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m.\n\nKaren Kurczynski\n\nThis course takes a new and interactive look at 20th Century art, from the move toward total abstraction around 1913 to the development of Postmodernism in the 1980s. We examine the impact on art of social and political events such as World War I, the Russian Revolution, the rise of Fascism, the Mexican Revolution, the New Woman in the 1920s, World War II, the Cold War, and the rise of consumer culture. We will investigate the origins and complex meanings of movements such as Fauvism, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Mexican Muralism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art. We will reconsider and reevaluate major issues in Modern art and culture such as the evolution of personal expression, the recognition of non-western culture in Euro-America, the interest in abstraction as a universal language, new technologies in art, the politics of the avant-garde and its attempts to reconnect art and life, issues of gender, race and representation, the role of myth and the unconscious, and the dialogue between art and popular culture. (Gen. Ed. AT, DG)\n\nART-HIS 391C – Caravaggio\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nMonika Schmitter\n\nWas Caravaggio a \"rebel\" artist? What was so revolutionary about his art? How did it relate to violence of his times, to the Catholic Church, to his own sexuality? These are some of the questions we will investigate in this course. Together we will create a virtual exhibition of Caravaggio's paintings examining the themes of his art and investigating their resonances for our lives today and for contemporary art. Assignments include assembling the collaborative exhibition website, as well as writing individual research papers.\n\nASIAN 397B – Bridging Asian and Asian American\n\nWednesday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nC.N. Le\n\nTalks by local and visiting faculty, as well as film screenings and performances, designed to introduce students to the multi-layered connections between Asia and Asian America.

Discussions emphasize how issues play out at local, national and transnational levels.\n\nCOMM 271 – Humor in Society\n\nMonday, Wednesday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nStephen Olbrys Gencarella\n\nThis course examines humor as a significant form of creative expression in social and political life. In recent decades, scholars of all persuasions from the humanities, social sciences, and even hard sciences have examined this subject through a critical lens, leading to the development of an interdisciplinary field known as humor studies. This course provides an introduction to that burgeoning field. Topics will include different theories of humor, the relationship between humor and play, the differences between humor and comedy, the use of humor in the redress of political and social tensions, the importance of the body in humor, and the role of humor in maintaining identity, especially in the negotiation of race, gender, class, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. (Gen. Ed. SB) This course was formerly numbered COMM 297C. If you have already taken COMM 297C you cannot take this course.\n\nCOMM 297FA – Spirit and Stories: The Folklore of Alcohol\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nStephen Olbrys Gencarella\n\nThis course examines the vast store of folklore inspired by and directed at alcohol and its cultural reach. Folklore means traditional expressive practices ranging from the verbal arts (such as stories and songs) to material culture (such as crafts and medicine) to customary activities (such as rituals and beliefs). The range of folklore herein is both global and ancient; that is, it concerns the entire history of alcohol, which in effect necessitates attention to the entire history of humanity in a global perspective. Specific lectures will address cultural differences concerning alcohol in the negotiation of race, ethnicity, class, nationhood, religion, gender, and political identity.\n\nCOMM 297FS – Introduction to Fashion Studies\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nAnne Ciecko\n\nSee department for description.\n\nCOMM 338 – Children, Teens and Media\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m.\n\nErica Scharer\n\nIn this seminar, we will explore the role of media (television, Internet, video games, mobile media, film, etc.) in shaping the lives of children and teens. We will consider how much time children devote to various media, what they think about what they encounter through media, and the implications of media for children's lives. We will draw on social science research to examine a wide range of topics, including: depictions of race, class, gender, and sexuality in ads, programming, and other media forms; the role of media in the development of adolescent identity; media uses and effects in the realms of educational TV and apps, advertising and consumer culture, violence, and sex; and the possibilities of media literacy, parental rules and dialogue, and public policies to shape children's interactions with media.\n\nCOMM 394I – Performance and the Politics of Race\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nKimberlee Perez\n\nThis course looks at the ways race, racial identities, and interracial relations are formed through and by communication practices in present-day U.S. America. Though focusing on U.S. America in the current historical moment, the course takes into account the ways history as well as the transnational flows of people and capital inform and define conversations about race and racial identities. Race will be discussed as intersectional, taking into account the ways race is understood and performed in relation to gender, sexuality, class, and nation. The course will focus on the performance and communications of race, ranging from everyday interactions, personal narratives and storytelling, intra- and inter-racial dialogue, and staged performances.\n\nCOMP-LIT – Comedy\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nTBD\n\nOur course begins with the premise that contemporary American comedy is informed by the histories of ethnic American groups -- African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and U.S. Latinos/Latinas -- along with issues of race, class, sexuality and citizenship. American comedians, independent filmmakers, feminists and transgendered comics deploy the language of comedy to invoke serious social matters in contemporary American life: racism, heterosexism, homophobia, class biases against the poor and the undocumented, misogyny, war and other burning issues of the day. We will thus consider that the ends of comedy are more than laughter. Comedy confronts political issues that are constitutive of and threatening to the U.S. body politic. (Gen. Ed. AL)\n\nEDUC 590Z - Critical Pedagogy of Media and Literature\n\nTuesday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nKysa Nygreen\n\nThis course brings the rigorous study of educational inequality together with the tools of critical media analysis to explore representations and realities of inequality in schools with a focus on race, class, ability, gender, and sexuality. Students will also develop skills to teach for critical media literacy using critical pedagogical methods.\n\nENGLISH 269 – American Literature and Culture after 1865\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nSarah Patterson\n\nFigures of Contestation in American Literature and Film. In this class, we will address literary and theoretical works that tackle America’s changing cultural landscape from 1865 to 1930. In mainstream entertainment culture, fiction constituted the one of the nation’s most popular forms of artistic and political expression, creating spaces for dissent and hagiography alike. From images of workers in industrial squalor, poverty and prostitution in urban city streets to utopian depictions of feminist communities and rallying orations at national conventions, this course will introduce turn-of-the-century figures of contestation taken from the Civil War, Gilded Age, Women’s Rights and the Harlem Renaissance eras. Canonical and lesser-known readings include Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, Paul Laurence Dunbar’s The Sport of the Gods, Nella Larsen’s Quicksand and the 1915 propaganda film Birth of a Nation. Alongside core readings and film viewings, students will have an opportunity to experience the textual formats and iconography that undergirded past reading cultures using digitized historical newspapers and image archives. Assignments include discussion, a class presentation and short critical responses.\n\nENGLISH 279 – Introduction to American Studies\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nHoang Phan\n\nInterdisciplinary approach to the study of American culture.

Ed. AL, DU)\n\nENGLISH 359 – The Victorian Imagination\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m.\n\nJill Franks\n\nWe will focus on Jane Austen and Charles Dickens—their lives and selected works. Austen’s prolific years were the 1810s; Dickens’s, the 1840s and 1850s. Reading key works of both authors, we’ll trace developments in English history from Austen’s Regency period through Dickens’s mid-Victorian era. Supplementing our novels with Claire Tomalin’s authoritative biographies of the writers, we’ll ground our reading of fictional narratives in real-life events and the authors’ personal challenges. Discussion of social issues will include these topics: gender roles, the marriage market, class satire, poverty, imperialism, the prison system, and racism.\n\nFRENCHST 280 - Love & Sex in French Culture\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nPatrick Mensah\n\nIs love a French invention? How do we explore, through literature, the substance behind the stereotypical association of love, romance, and sexual pleasure with French culture? Do sex, passion, and love always unite in the pursuit of emotional fulfillment in human relations, according to this literature? What affiliations does this literature interweave between such relations of love, requited or unrequited, and pleasure, enjoyment, freedom, self-empowerment, on the one hand, and on the other hand, suffering, jealousy, crime, violence, negativity, notions of perversion, morbidity, and even death? How are problems of gender roles and human sexuality --i.e. Hetero-, bi-, homo- and other forms of sexuality--approached in this literature? What connections or conflicts are revealed in this literature between human love relationships and the social norms and conventions within which they occur, as well as the forms of political governance that have been practiced in France over the centuries? Those are some of the issues that are investigated in this course, which offers a broad historical overview of selective ways in which love, passion, desire and erotic behavior in French culture have been represented and understood in Literature and, more recently, in film, from the middle ages to the twentieth century. Readings are from major French authors drawn from various centuries such as Marie de France, Beroul, Moliere, de Sade, Flaubert, Gide, and Duras. They will be supplemented with screenings of optional films that are based on those texts or are pertinent to them in important ways. (Gen. Ed. AL)\n\nFRENCHST 444/644 – Eighteenth Century Theatre and Novel\n\nThursday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mensah\n\nThe French Enlightenment involved a critical renewal of European political and philosophical self-understanding through an iconoclastic revision of literary and philosophical representational forms associated with the ancient regime. This ‘renewal’ entailed a rethinking of the role of reason in political and social life, a re-conception of gender relations, and a redefinition of Europe’s relationship with non-European cultures. We will follow the staging of this triple agenda in the works (novels and plays) of Montesquieu, Beaumarchais, Marivaus, Rousseau, Diderot, Laclos, Prevost, Voltaire, and other luminaries of the Encyclopedie movement.\n\nGERMAN 270 – From the Grimms to Disney\n\nMonday, Wednesday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nSara Jackson\n\nThis course focuses on selected fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm (Hansel & Gretel, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Iron Hans) and Hans Christian Andersen (Little Sea Maid, The Red Shoes), locating them in the 19th-century German or Danish culture of their origins and then examining how they became transformed into perennial favorites of U.S. popular culture through their adaptations by Disney (feature animation films), Broadway (musicals), or bestselling self-help books (Iron John, Women Who Run With the Wolves). As a point of comparison, this course will also introduce popular fairy-tale films of the former East Germany (GDR) from the UMass DEFA archives & library, which present the same stories as popular fare in a Cold War communinistcommunist cultural context. Conducted in English. (Gen. Ed. AL).\n\nHISTORY 154 – Social Change in the 1960s\n\nSocial Justice RAP – Moore Hall\n\nJoie-Lynn Campbell Jason Higgins\n\nOpen to first-year students in the Connecting to Social Justice RAP in Moore Hall. Students in Connecting with Social Justice RAP in Moore Hall will enroll together in \"Social Change in the 1960s\" (History 154). This course examines the major historical events and social justice movements that took place from the mid ?1950s into the 1970s through the lens of pop culture, including rock 'n' roll. Considering race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation, students will be encouraged to think critically about music's impact then, as well as its connections to the world today\n\nHISTORY 154 – Social Change in the 1960s\n\nSocial Justice RAP – Kennedy Hall\n\nAndrew Grim\n\nFew periods in United States. history experienced as much change and turmoil as the \"Long Sixties\" (1954-1975), when powerful social movements overhauled American gender norms, restructured the Democratic and Republican parties, and abolished the South's racist \"Jim Crow\" regime. This course examines the movements that defined this era. We will explore the civil rights and Black Power movements; the student New Left and the antiwar movement; the women's and gay liberation movements; struggles for Asian American, Chicano/a, Native American, and Puerto Rican freedom; as well as the rise of conservatism. Throughout the semester, we will assess Sixties social movements' ideals, strategies, and achievements, and their ongoing influence upon U.S. politics, society, and culture. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nHISTORY 264 – History of Health Care and Medicine in the U.S.\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-10:5 a.m.\n\nFriday discussions\n\nEmily Hamilton\n\nThis course explores the history and social meaning of medicine, medical practice, health care, and disease in the United States from 1600 to the present. Using a variety of sources aimed at diverse audiences students will investigate topics such as: the evolution of beliefs about the body; medical and social responses to infectious and chronic disease; the rise of medical science and medical organizations; the development of medical technologies; mental health diagnosis and treatment; changing conceptions of the body; the training, role, and image of medical practitioners and the role of public and government institutions in promoting health practices and disease treatments. We will pay particular attention to the human experience of medicine, with readings on the experience of being ill, the delivery of compassionate care, and the nature of the relationship between practitioners and patients. Course themes will include race, gender, cultural diversity, women and gender, social movements, science, technology, politics, industry, and ethics. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nLABOR 297S/SOCIOL 297S – Sports, Labor and Social Justice\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nJerrold Levinsky\n\nProtests by professional and amateur athletes against racial and gender discrimination are not new or isolated events in U.S. history. In fact, sports have long been connected to the social, economic, and political issues of the day. With a particular focus on labor and civil rights struggle, our goal is to better understand the history of sports as it relates to social class, race, and gender. Students will analyze current controversies through this critical approach to sports and society.\n\nPUBLHLTH 389 – Health Inequities\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 10:10-11:00 a.m.\n\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday 11:!5-12:05 p.m.\n\nJya Plavin\n\nWhile the health and wellbeing of the nation has improved overall, racial, ethnic, gender and sexuality disparities in morbidity and mortality persist. To successfully address growing disparities, it is important to understand social determinants of health and translate current knowledge into specific strategies to undo health inequalities. This course will explore social justice as a philosophical underpinning of public health and will consider the etiology of disease rooted in social conditions. It aims to strengthen critical thinking, self-discovery, and knowledge of ways in which socioeconomic, political, and cultural systems structure health outcomes. (Gen. Ed. SB, DU)\n\nPSYCH 391U – Close Relationships\n\nTuesday, Thursday 4:00-5:15 p.m.\n\nEvelyn Mercado\n\nThis course will explore the many psychological mechanisms that play a part in close personal relationships. Using psychological research as our foundation, students will be led in discussions and about attraction, love, lust, and other topics pertinent to close relationships. Students will be asked to think deeply about the social constructs that influence human preferences, and the bio-psychosocial processes at play. The course will begin by dissecting the concepts of attraction and love. We will also discuss attachment theory and interpersonal dynamics such as jealousy, power, and communication. We will explore how notions of love and attraction are defined or re-defined or lived by the LGBTQ+ community, and how or why these relationships come/came to be stigmatized. Lastly, we will finish the course discussing the portrayal of sex in the media and online, and its implications on sex education and sexual understanding.\n\nSOCIOL 222 – The Family\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:20 p.m.\n\nDiscussions Friday\n\nNaomi Gerstel\n\nFirst part: historical transformations in family life (relationships between husbands and wives, position and treatment of children, importance of kinship ties); second part: the contemporary family through life course (choice of a mate, relations in marriage, parenthood, breakup of the family unit).

Our focus is the history of social thought in the West, and the decolonial critiques of some of these ideas. In this course, students will learn that \"radical\" means \"at the root,\" and radical social theory is theory that explains the roots of social inequalities and proposes ways of transforming society to build a better world. As a General Education course, our goal is for students to have the opportunity to discuss key societal issues through a variety of disciplines, including philosophy, anthropology, history, economics, Black, Latinx, and gender and sexuality studies. Through analysis of readings and films, we will explore the connection between cultural processes and power in the West and the implications for People of Color on a global scale and across time and space. Seats in this course are reserved for freshmen and sophomores of SBS or HFA. STPEC students may enroll. Gen Ed: HS and DG\n\nSTPEC 391H – Core Seminar I\n\nTuesday, Thursday 2:30-3:45 p.m.\n\nGraciela Monteagudo\n\nSTPEC Core Seminar I focuses on major theoretical currents in political theory and the historical circumstances that gave rise to those theories - in particular Liberalism, Marxism, Anarchism, Decolonial, and Poststructural theories.

Continuing our analysis of racial capitalism and empire, Core II will explore how these formations changed due to economic crisis, national liberation, and class struggle. We will research the connections between race, class, gender, sexuality, disease, and other axes of oppression under racial capitalism. A major research paper of the student's choosing will be produced over the course of the semester allowing students to more deeply engage with a topic, and to practice applying the critical methodological and theoretical tools developed in the STPEC curriculum. Enrollment is limited to 15 students. STPEC majors only.\n\nSTPEC 492H – Focus Seminar II\n\nWednesday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nStellan Vinthagen\n\nTopic: Constructive Resistance: Building a new society out of the ashes of the old\n\nThis course focuses on movements and communities that apply \"constructive resistance\" or build new societies while simultaneously resisting the existing oppressive systems. Constructive resistance is pre-figurative action that change here and now (as \"direct action\"), and as such it stands in contrast to \"protest,\" \"demands\" or \"respectability politics\" by activists who wants to compel or force the state, elites or others to create the change. Constructive resistance is a neglected concept, in academia and among activists, despite being practiced everywhere. It shows a wide variation, with more or less \"construction\" of alternatives or “resistance” to existing systems; and, is guided by very different values, principles, strategies and visions. Such productive resistance is particularly developed among Indigenous communities and poor people's movements in the Global South. They fight to survive against physical and cultural genocide, marginalization or colonization of their land, resources and communities, and stay alive by regenerating, recreating and developing resilience through autonomous social structures. They create parallel societies of political, economic, cultural or spiritual organizations, which also serve as the basis of their ability to resist repression, cooptation and marginalization. We also find at least elements of \"constructive resistance\" in the Global North, as for example within cooperatives, counter-cultural centers, food-banks, mutual aid networks, local exchange trading systems, non-profit banks, and within resistance movements that care for each other during repression. This course builds on both academic and activist texts, films and examples, making sure the course has both a clear activist perspective and an academic basis. The course gives social science concepts and theories to analyze resistance, creation of alternatives and parallel structures, but focuses on empirical examples of how poor and marginalized communities go to direct action: try to create autonomy, self-governance and build their own constructive programs and resist injustices. Key themes are community-based struggles and the combination of resisting injustice with building new societies and alternatives. Seminars will involve students through discussions, which follow up on background lectures, guest visits from researchers and activists, films, literature readings, student projects, etc. Assignments consist mainly of a book review, oral presentations, and a course paper analyzing a chosen case of relevance. Extra credits are offered for excursions to relevant projects in New England. The overall aim with this course is to develop strategies of social change: to critically assess popular struggles that build alternative ways of life, and what challenges and possibilities movement activists face when they try to combine resistance with the building of new societies.\n\nSTPEC 320 – Writing for Critical Consciousness\n\nMonday 4:00-6:30 p.m.\n\nGraciela Monteagudo\n\nStudents hone skills necessary to write in the genres that STPEC majors encounter most often in the course of their academic and professional careers. Contact department for details.\n\nSPANISH 324 – Introduction to Latina/o Literature\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m.\n\nStephanie Fetta\n\nIn this course students will think critically about the various \"wild tongues\" that have defined U.S. Latinx literature and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. Our analysis will center on issues of power as they are experienced by diverse U.S. Latinx populations. Specifically, we will focus on Latinx writers, performers, and scholars that push the boundaries of acceptable gender, sexuality, and racialization within U.S. Latinx cultures, focusing specifically on Caribbean and Chicanx populations in the United States. Students will be required to engage critically with primary texts, as well as reflect on the ways in which these issues exist in the world around us. Because Latinx thinkers often blur the boundaries of traditional literary and scholarly genres, we will consider pinnacle works of Latinx studies - such as those of Pedro Pietri, Gloria Anzaldua, and Junot Diaz - alongside other forms of cultural production, such as performance art and film. We will also try our hands at these art forms in an effort to find new, embodied ways to interact with expressions of Latinx culture. Course texts are written in both English and Spanish. Class discussion will take place in Spanish. All assignments must be completed in Spanish. (Gen. Ed. AL, DU)\n\nTHEATER 130 – Contemporary Playwrights of Color\n\nTuesday, Thursday 10:00-11:15 a.m. – Priscilla Page\n\nTuesday, Thursday 11:30-12:45 p.m. – TBD Tatiana Godfrey\n\nTheater movements of Blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans, and the body of literature by contemporary playwrights of color within a historical context. (Gen. Ed. AL, DU)\n\nTHEATER 329 – Contemporary Native American Performance\n\nTuesday, Thursday 1:00-2:15 p.m.\n\nPriscilla Page\n\nContemporary Native American Performance is an area of study with deep roots in culturally specific production and an ever-evolving practice by a wide range of artists. In this Junior Year Writing course we will read plays and performative texts created by Native American artists since the 1960's. We will begin our study by acknowledging the limitations of language and the always contentious issue of labels. Within this critical framework, we will study the art as well as the attending social, political, and historical contexts. We will examine innovations and experimentation with artistic form and study each artist’s use of language, style and thematic content. Imperative topics of discussion will include gender roles, expressions of sexuality, class position, and cultural identity as articulated by the artists we study. Theater is an interactive, living art form. With this in mind, we will attend relevant performances and generate in-class performances.\n\nSUMMER/FALL 2020 UWW (ONLINE) COURSES\n\nWGSS Majors and Minors must focus their papers or projects on WGSS topics to count courses listed as \"component.\" 100-level courses only count toward the minor.

Drawing on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural studies, students will engage critically with issues such as gender inequities, sexuality, families, work, media images, queer issues, masculinity, reproductive rights, and history. Throughout the course, students will explore how experiences of gender and sexuality intersect with other social constructs of difference, including race/ethnicity, class, and age. Special attention will be paid to the ways in which interlocking systems of oppression have shaped and influenced the historical, cultural, social, political, and economical contexts of our lives, and the social movements at the local, national and transnational levels which have led to key transformations. (Gen. Ed. I, DU)\n\nWGSS 292S – The Cultural Politics of Pandemics\n\nKirsten Leng\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 crisis has shed light—often harsh light—upon the realities of life in 2020. It has exposed the implications of the decades-long rollback of social and economic welfare programs; the vulnerability of globally-interconnected economic systems premised on free markets and entrepreneurship; the gendered and raced division of productive and reproductive labour; and the perennial racist and xenophobic impulses that seek to scapegoat a crisis. COVID-19 has also raised questions about the nature of community and compassion, the importance of interpersonal relationships, the meaning of freedom in public health emergencies, and the ethics of collective responsibility, particularly for the most vulnerable among us. In The Cultural Politics of Pandemics, we will explore all of these issues, using COVID-19 as a launching point but broadening out to consider pandemics of the past. Materials will include theoretical and historical texts regarding health and pandemics, contemporary journalistic coverage, and cultural works including novellas, graphic novels, and films.\n\nWGSS 295M - Making Monsters: Gender, Race and Monstrosity From Mary Shelley to the Walking Dead\n\nLaura Ciolkowski\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nFrom Frankenstein's monster to the Walking Dead the figure of the monster has always been a powerful presence, threatening social order, unsettling racial divisions and sexual norms, inciting fear and desire, and complicating our understanding of Nature and the Human. In this course we will grapple with the representation of monstrosity in literature, art, and classic and contemporary film. Approaching the figure of the monster through the interdisciplinary and intersectional lens of social justice feminism, gender and sexuality studies, and critical race theory, we will ask how monstrosity is represented and defined at various moments in history, what sociocultural and political purposes are served, and how the transgressive figure of the monster helps us to discipline, organize, and also reimagine fundamental aspects of ourselves and the world around us. How do monsters help us to classify, regulate, and also refigure what (and who) gets to count as Human? What do monsters reveal for us about our complicated investments in cultural norms, our nuanced relationships to racialized and sexualized “difference,” and the desire to reinvent our universe and ourselves otherwise? Course materials may include: Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, Katherine Dunn, Geek Love; Octavia Butler, Fledgling; William Shakespeare, The Tempest; Angela Carter, Black Venus; the art of Kara Walker and Romare Bearden; and film and video, including Jordan Peele’s Get Out and Us; episodes from The Walking Dead and Black Mirror; Monsters, Inc.; and Nosferatu.\n\nWGSS 395G – Gender, Sexuality, Race and the Law: Critical Interventions\n\nAdina Giannelli\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nDrawing on U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, gender and sexuality studies, sociological literature, policy papers, documentary, and international law, we will examine the ways in which gender, sexuality, and race are constructed, contested, and regulated within legal, legislative, and juridical frameworks, across systems, spaces, and temporalities. Throughout this course, we will consider what the law is, what it does, how it operates to uphold systems of power and oppression and how it can be deployed in the service of intervention. More relevant issues and problems within civil rights will be considered including: constitutional, family, and criminal law; the legal construction of race, gender, and sexuality; feminist approaches to the law of gender, sexuality, and race; the role of privacy, morality, and \"rights\" in the regulation of sexuality and the family; reproductive rights; adoption, bioethics, family formation, immigration, reproductive technologies, and violence; and finally, the relationship between legal intervention, critical race & feminist theory, activism, and praxis.\n\nANTHRO 106 – Culture Through Film\n\nJustin Helepololei\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nComponent\n\nExploration of different societies and cultures, and of the field of cultural anthropology through the medium of film. Ethnographic and documentary films; focus on gender roles, ethnicity, race, class, religion, politics, and social change. (Gen.Ed. SB, DG)\n\nANTHRO 258 – Food and Culture\n\nDana Conzo\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nThis course surveys how cultural anthropologists have studied the big questions about food and culture. How and why do people restrict what foods are considered \"edible\" or morally acceptable? How is food processed and prepared, and what does food tell us about other aspects of culture like gender and ethnic identity? How have power issues of gender, class, and colonialism shaped people's access to food? How has industrialization changed food, and where are foodways headed in the future? Along the way, students will read and see films about foodways in Europe, Africa, Asia, the United States, and Latin America. (Gen. Ed. SB, DG)\n\nCOMM 284 – Possible Futures: SciFi Cinema\n\nKevin Anderson\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nComponent\n\nThere are multiple growing concerns regarding issues of climate, class, race, gender identity, and the nature of democracy in our contemporary world. Science fiction has proven to be a thought-provoking genre to help raise awareness to many of these social and environmental issues. This course takes a global perspective on such pressing issues by examining science fiction films from around the world. As such, the course uses science fiction films as primary texts, accompanied by weekly readings. Students will engage in a critical analysis of the assigned films and readings in order to better appreciate what we can begin to anticipate regarding our future. (Gen. Ed. SB, DG)\n\nCOMM 287 -Advertising as Social Communication\n\nSut Jhally\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nThis course looks at how the industries of media and public relations have been used as instruments of social control and propaganda by economic and political elites. Examined will be the following: the historical roots of the public relations industry in government propaganda efforts; the contemporary influence of the public relations industry on public debate of social issues; the role of public relations in distorting discussion of the military/industrial complex; the effects of structuring media systems around the needs of advertisers; the role of media and public relations in how the public understands both domestic and international issues (such as war).\n\nCOMM 288 – Gender, Sex and Representation\n\nSut Jhally\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nThis course will examine the relationship between commercialized systems of representation and the way that gender and sexuality are thought of and organized in the culture. In particular, we will look at how commercial imagery impacts upon gender identity and the process of gender socialization. Central to this discussion will be the related issues of sexuality and sexual representation (and the key role played by advertising).\n\nCOMM 336 – Consumer Culture\n\nEmily West\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nThe mass media are frequently criticized for their role in creating or perpetuating materialism and a consumer culture. This course will consider different theoretical and disciplinary approaches to understanding our consumer culture and the mass media's place in it. Topics will include the influence of advertisers on a media environment that promotes consumption; the experience of shopping; the exercise of taste through consumption; the relationship between consumerism, citizenship, and patriotism; consumer rights; and the meaning of consumption for economically disadvantaged groups.\n\nEDUC 210 – Social Diversity in Education\n\nWarren Blumenfeld\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nComponent\n\nFocus on issues of social identity, social and cultural diversity, and societal manifestations of oppression.

This course offers a broad historical overview of the ways in which love and erotic behavior in French culture have been represented and understood in the arts, especially in Literature and, more recently, in film, from the middle ages to the twentieth century. (Gen. Ed. AL)\n\nHISTORY 160 – Social Change in the 1960s\n\nJulia Sandy-Bailey\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nFew periods in United States history experienced as much change and turmoil as the \"Long Sixties\" (1954-1975), when powerful social movements overhauled American gender norms, restructured the Democratic and Republican parties, and abolished the South's racist \"Jim Crow\" regime. This course examines the movements that defined this era. We will explore the civil rights and Black Power movements; the student New Left and the antiwar movement; the women's and gay liberation movements; struggles for Asian American, Chicano/a, Native American, and Puerto Rican freedom; as well as the rise of conservatism. Throughout the semester, we will assess Sixties social movements' ideals, strategies, and achievements, and their ongoing influence upon U.S. politics, society, and culture. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nHISTORY 264 – History of Health Care and Medicine in the U.S.\n\nEmily Hamilton\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nThis course explores the history and social meaning of medicine, medical practice, health care, and disease in the United States from 1600 to the present. Using a variety of sources aimed at diverse audiences students will investigate topics such as: the evolution of beliefs about the body; medical and social responses to infectious and chronic disease; the rise of medical science and medical organizations; the development of medical technologies; mental health diagnosis and treatment; changing conceptions of the body; the training, role, and image of medical practitioners and the role of public and government institutions in promoting health practices and disease treatments. We will pay particular attention to the human experience of medicine, with readings on the experience of being ill, the delivery of compassionate care, and the nature of the relationship between practitioners and patients. Course themes will include race, gender, cultural diversity, women and gender, social movements, science, technology, politics, industry, and ethics. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nHISTORY 265 – US and LGBT and Queer History\n\nShay Olmstead\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nThis course explores how queer individuals and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities have influenced the social, cultural, economic, and political landscape in United States history. With a focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the course covers topics such as the criminalization of same-sex acts, cross-dressing, industrialization and urbanization, feminism, the construction of the homo/heterosexual binary, transsexuality and the \"lavender scare\" during the Cold War, the homophile, gay liberation, and gay rights movements, HIV/AIDS, and (im)migration. We will often look to examples from the present to better explore change over time and the modes and influences that shape both current and past understandings of gender and sexual difference. (Gen. Ed. HS, DU)\n\nPOLISCI 395F – Women and Politics\n\nSarah Tanzi\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nWomen have made tremendous gains in every aspect of social, economic and political life in the United States, particularly since the second wave of the women's movement in the 1960s. Yet, women's progress in terms of achieving elected office has reached a puzzling plateau since the 1990s. We will examine the course of women's movements towards achieving political incorporation in the United States. We consider the debate over why women's political progress has stagnated and we consider the impact of the gender imbalance in American electoral politics - to what extent do these disparities matter? We begin by exploring women's suffrage campaigns and voting behavior in the period immediately following their achievement of the right to vote and beyond. We then turn to the relationship between women and party politics before discussing the challenges women face as candidates in American politics. We will focus on understanding why women remain underrepresented as legislators. We then consider the extent to which women's participation in campaigns and elections makes a substantive difference in policy making.\n\nPUBHLTH 340 – LGBTQ Health\n\nKelsey Jordan\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nThis course is about the unique health needs and health disparities within the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) communities, and among the individuals who make up each of these communities. We will learn about gender identity and sexual orientation development in kids and young adults, sexual health, global perspectives, strategies for improving the healthcare experience of LGBT people (e.g., patient-centered and compassionate care), barriers to accessing health care, and many other relevant topics. This is an important course for public health students, because it teaches more than just the facts, but also skills for creating a compassionate and inclusive environment for vulnerable populations. (Gen. Ed. SB, DU)\n\nPUBHLTH 370 – Public Health Through the Ages: A History of Public Health Practice in the United Stages\n\nKelsey Jordan\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nComponent\n\nThis course will provide emerging public health professionals with an overview of the historical evolution of the field of public health, from Hippocrates to war and industrialization; from the sanitary movement, quarantine, and the development of public health boards; to the ethical concerns linked to the management and control of disease and promotion of health. In the second half of the semester, we will use the example of maternal and reproductive health to illustrate some of the underlying tensions in current public health research and programming. Enhancing student’s understanding of the history of public health will provide essential perspectives on current public health events and concerns to both inform and strengthen approaches to improving overall health.\n\nPUBHLTH 389 – Health Inequities\n\nTorin Moore\n\nSummer Session 2\n\nComponent\n\nWhile the health and wellbeing of the nation has improved overall, racial, ethnic, gender and sexuality disparities in morbidity and mortality persist. To successfully address growing disparities, it is important to understand social determinants of health and translate current knowledge into specific strategies to undo health inequalities. This course will explore social justice as a philosophical underpinning of public health and will consider the etiology of disease rooted in social conditions. It aims to strengthen critical thinking, self-discovery, and knowledge of ways in which socioeconomic, political, and cultural systems structure health outcomes. (Gen. Ed. SB, DU)\n\nSOCIOL 106 – Race, Gender, Class and Ethnicity\n\nJuyeon Park\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nIntroduction to Sociology.

We examine different theories of conformity and deviance, using topics such as sexuality and politics.\n\nSOCIOL 397AM – Asylums, Madness and Mental Illness in American Culture\n\nJanice Irvine\n\nSummer Session 1\n\nComponent\n\nThis course uses the rise and fall of the asylum movement to examine shifting ideas about \"mental illness\" and its treatment, from the mid-19th century to the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s. Born of a utopian spirit dedicated to healing minds broken by the modern world, insane asylums devolved into \"theaters of madness\" where \"lunatics\" were stigmatized and warehoused. Race, gender, class, and sexuality shaped how mental illness has been conceptualized and treated over a pivotal century in American culture. Using sociological research and popular culture - such as films, novels, and television - we examine the asylum as a type of social control, and mid-20th century criticisms of asylums as \"total institutions.\"\n\nUWW 397SV – Sexual Violence\n\nLisa Fontes\n\nSession 2\n\nThis course explores sexual violence in the United States from psychological, sociological, public health, feminist, legal, historical, and criminal justice perspectives.

Its primary goal is to provide a forum for students to consider the history of sexuality and race in the U.S. both in terms of theoretical frameworks within women's and gender studies, and in terms of a range of sites where those theoretical approaches become material, are negotiated, or are shifted. The course is a fully interdisciplinary innovation. It will emphasize the links rather than differences between theory and practice and between cultural, material, and historical approaches to the body, gender, and sexuality. Throughout the course we will consider contemporary sexual politics \"from the science of sex and sexuality to marriage debates\" in light of histories of racial and sexual formations. (Gen. Ed.
