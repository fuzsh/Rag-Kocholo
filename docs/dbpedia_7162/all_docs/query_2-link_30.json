The venue is ASME's Summer Heat Transfer Conference (SHTC), Fluids Engineering Division Summer Meeting (FEDSM), and International Conference on Nanochannels and Microchannels (ICNMM). The occasion is an opportune time to celebrate and reflect on the origin of FED and its predecessor—the Hydraulic Division (HYD), which existed from 1926–1963. Furthermore, the FED Executive Committee decided that it would be appropriate to publish concurrently a history of the HYD/FED.},\n\ndoi = {10.1115/1.4033976},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1339294}, journal = {Journal of Fluids Engineering},\n\nissn = {0098-2202},\n\nnumber = 10,\n\nvolume = 138,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2016},\n\nmonth = {Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2016}\n\n}"
