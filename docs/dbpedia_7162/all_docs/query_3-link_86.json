However, numerical simulations of chemical reactions inside an air bubble in water indicate that the main oxidant is not always OH radical but sometimes H2O2 or O atom. The lifetime of O atom in the gas–liquid interface region is, however, unknown partly due to unknown temperature in the region. It has been experimentally reported that the upper levels of OH vibration are overpopulated inside a sonoluminescing bubble compared to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution from the analysis of OH line spectra in SL. However, the reason is unknown although it could be due to the excitation through chemical reactions. The acoustic ﬁeld inside a sonochemical reactor is also not fully understood because bubbles strongly attenuate ultrasound and radiate acoustic waves into the liquid. The spatial distribution of bubbles is strongly inhomogeneous. The number density of bubbles temporally changes due to fragmentation, coalescence, and dissolution. The liquid surface vibrates under ultrasound. The vibration of the container’s wall also affects the acoustic ﬁeld because acoustic waves are radiated K.

An acoustic wave (a sound wave) is a propagation of pressure oscillation in the medium with the velocity of sound (Fig. 1) [1]. The sound velocity in liquid water is about 1500 m/s, while that in air is about 340 m/s. When a liquid is irradiated by a strong ultrasonic wave, the instantaneous local pressure becomes negative at the rarefaction phase of the ultrasonic wave. The negative pressure is a tension to expand the liquid element, which never occurs in gas phase. When negative pressure occurs in liquid adjacent to a solid surface (especially hydrophobic surface), gas bubbles are created at the solid surface (solid surface could be that of motes or dust particles in solution). Bubbles are more easily created at crevices of the solid, because inside a crevice the gas–liquid interface is concave with regard to the gas phase. Then the Laplace pressure caused by the\n\nFig. 1 An acoustic wave (Reprinted with permission from Yasui et al. [1].

Thus the dissolution of gas into the surrounding liquid is strongly retarded, and gas diffuses into the gas pocket in the crevice at the rarefaction phase of ultrasound due to the expansion of the gas pocket and decrease in the gas pressure [2]. Created bubbles repeat expansion and collapse according to the pressure oscillation of ultrasound. Sometimes the bubble collapse becomes very violent because of the spherically converging geometry and the inertia of the inwardly moving liquid [2]. The speed of such bubble collapse increases up to the sound velocity in the liquid near the bubble wall [3]. Such the bubble collapse is called the Rayleigh collapse. The creation and collapse of bubbles under ultrasound is called acoustic cavitation. At the end of the Rayleigh collapse, the temperature and pressure inside a bubble dramatically increase up to a few thousand Kelvin and a few thousand atmospheric pressure or more, respectively. It is because the work done on a bubble by the surrounding liquid during the bubble collapse is mostly converted into the thermal energy inside a bubble as the bubble collapse is so fast that thermal conduction between the heated interior of the bubble and the surrounding liquid is not dominant. As a result, water vapor and oxygen gas (if present) are dissociated inside the heated interior of a bubble. Then, oxidants such as OH radicals, O atoms, H2O2, and O3 are created inside a bubble. The oxidants diffuse out of the bubble into the surrounding liquid, and solutes such as pollutants are oxidized by them. Such chemistry is called sonochemistry. In addition, a faint light is emitted from a bubble as a pulse due to the high temperature, which is called sonoluminescence. In the present chapter, mainly three topics are discussed focusing on unsolved problems in this ﬁeld. One is the main oxidants created inside a bubble in water. Numerical simulations have indicated that not only OH radicals and H2O2 but also an appreciable amount of O atoms are created inside an air bubble. However, the lifetime of O atom in liquid water as well as its role in sonochemical reactions is unknown at present. Another is OH line emission in sonoluminescence. The topic is on the non-Boltzmann distribution of the vibrational population of OH radicals. Is it due to the nonequilibrium state of gas inside a bubble? Is it due to chemical excitation of vibrational states of OH radicals? (Is OH line emission originated in chemiluminescence?) The other is on an acoustic ﬁeld. What is the inﬂuence of the attenuation of an acoustic wave due to bubbles on an acoustic ﬁeld? How about the inﬂuence of acoustic radiation from vibrating walls of a container?\n\nMain Oxidants (OH Radical, H2O2, and O Atom) The main oxidant created inside a bubble in water under ultrasound has long been believed as OH radical [4]. Here we discuss that the main oxidant is not always OH radical but sometimes O atom and H2O2. In Figs. 2 and 3, the results of the numerical simulation of the pulsation of an isolated spherical air bubble in water irradiated with 300 kHz and 3-bar ultrasound are shown [5]. A bubble expands during the rarefaction phase of ultrasound and, violently, collapses during the initial compression\n\n4\n\nK.

At the end of the bubble collapse (Rayleigh collapse), the temperature increases up to 5100 K (Fig. 3a). The density at the moment reaches 650 kg/m3 which is in the same order of magnitude as that of the condensed phase (liquid density) (Fig. 3b). The pressure inside a bubble reaches 6 109 Pa (=6 GPa = 60,000 bar) at the moment. Most of water vapor and many of O2 are dissociated inside the heated interior of a bubble, and many chemical products are created such as H2O2, HO2, O, O3, HNO2, HNO3, H2, and OH radical (Fig. 3c). In this case, the main oxidant is H2O2 according to the numerical simulation. In the present numerical simulations, nonequilibrium effect of chemical reactions is taken into account. Rates of chemical reactions are calculated using the modiﬁed Arrhenius equations. Rates of backward reactions are also calculated. The chemical kinetic model used in the present simulations has been partially validated by hydrogen ﬂame studies [6]. Furthermore, the present model of bubble dynamics including the chemical kinetic model has been validated by the study of single-bubble sonochemistry for which direct comparison between the numerical and experimental results is possible [7]. The results of many numerical simulations of chemical reactions inside an air bubble are summarized in Fig. 4 for various ultrasonic frequencies and pressure\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n5\n\nFig. 3 The results of the numerical simulation under the condition of Fig. 2 at around the end of the bubble collapse.

Rates of production of each oxidant as well as temperature inside an air bubble are shown as a function of acoustic amplitude. The ambient bubble radius, which is the bubble radius when ultrasound is absent, is assumed as 5 μm, 3.5 μm, 3.5 μm, and 1 μm for 20 kHz, 100 kHz, 300 kHz, and 1 MHz, respectively, as they are the typical values for each frequency. For 20 kHz and 100 kHz, the bubble temperature takes a maximum value at relatively low acoustic amplitude and decreases as acoustic amplitude increases at relatively high acoustic amplitude. It is because the amount of water vapor inside a bubble increases due to larger expansion of a bubble [3]. Water vapor decreases the bubble temperature due to its endothermic dissociation as well as its larger molar heat than that of air. Thus we call a bubble ﬁlled mostly with water vapor a vaporous bubble, while a bubble with negligible amount of water vapor is called a gaseous\n\n6\n\nK. Yasui\n\nFig. 4 The results of the numerical simulations on the rate of production of each oxidant inside an isolated air bubble per second estimated by the ﬁrst bubble collapse as a function of acoustic amplitude with the temperature inside a bubble at the end of the bubble collapse (the thick line): (a) 20 kHz and R0 = 5 μm.

Then the results in Fig. 4 are summarized as follows. For vaporous bubbles, the main oxidant is OH radical. For gaseous bubbles, on the other hand, the main oxidant is H2O2 when the bubble temperature at the collapse ranges from 4000 K to 6500 K. When the bubble temperature is higher than 6500 K in gaseous bubbles, the main oxidant is O atom. When the bubble temperature is higher than 7000 K, the oxidants are strongly consumed inside an air bubble by oxidizing nitrogen [8]. By the thermal dissociation of H2O (H2O+ M ! OH + H + M, where M is the third molecule), the amount of H atoms is expected to be created by the same amount as that of OH radicals. However, the amount of OH radicals is much larger than that of H atoms (Fig. 3c). It is because the production of OH radicals is not only by the thermal dissociation of H2O but also by the following reactions: H2O + O ! OH +\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation I2 (1MKI . 0.0005M AM)\n\n2.0 rate [10-4M-min-1]\n\nFig. 5 Experimental results on the rate of production of H2O2 in pure water and that of I2 in 1 M KI solution or 1 M KI + 0.0005 M ammonium molybdate solution under various mixtures of argon and oxygen dissolved in the solution (Reprinted with permission from Hart and Henglein [9].

In addition, H atoms are also consumed by the reaction H + H ! H2. In 1985, Hart and Henglein [9] suggested that the O atom created inside a bubble may oxidize I ion in an aqueous KI solution in which the mixture of argon and O2 is dissolved. In their experimental results (Fig. 5), the amount of I2 production in aqueous KI solution (2OH + 2I ! I2 + 2OH, and in the presence of ammonium molybdate as catalyst H2O2 + 2I ! I2 + 2OH), is considerably larger than that of H2O2 in pure water (2OH ! H2O2). Thus they concluded that there should be some oxidant other than OH radical and H2O2. They assumed that it is O atom (O + 2I + 2H+ ! I2 + H2O). However, there has been no direct evidence on the production of O atom in solution by cavitation bubbles. Atomic oxygen (O atom) has eight electrons. Two of them are in the 1s orbitals. Other two electrons are in the 2s orbitals. The rest of four electrons are in the 2p orbitals when it is not highly excited (Fig. 6). The orbitals are characterized by the quantum numbers n, l, ml, and ms, where n is the principal quantum number, l is the orbital angular momentum, ml is the magnetic quantum number, and ms is the secondary spin quantum number [10]. Orbitals are designated s, p, d, f, g\n\n8\n\nK. Yasui\n\nFig. 6 Electronic conﬁgurations of ground state, ﬁrst excited state, and second excited state of atomic oxygen. Two electrons in 1s state are omitted\n\ncorresponding to the orbital angular momentum l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. For an orbital with n = 2 and l = 1, it is called 2p orbital. For n = 1 and l = 0, it is 1s orbital. The number in front of the symbol for orbital angular momentum is the principal quantum number. The magnetic quantum number (ml) can take the values of l, (l + 1), . . ., (l1), l. Thus for 2p orbital (l = 1), ml can take the values of 1, 0, and 1. For each ml state, two electrons can occupy (up-spin (ms = 1/2) and down-spin (ms = 1/2)). When four electrons are in 2p orbitals, there are only three conﬁgurations as in Fig. 6 [11, 12]. According to Hund’s ﬁrst rule, the ground state is the conﬁguration with the highest multiplicity. Only for the conﬁguration left side in Fig. 6, the X at the total spin angular momentum is nonzero (S ¼ ms ¼ 1 . Thus, this corresponds to the ground state as the multiplicity is the highest as 3 (For the other X two conﬁgurations, the multiplicity is 1). The total orbital angular momentum (L ¼ li where the summation takes for all the electrons of O atom) can take the values of 0, 1, and 2 because the allowed values of the total angular momentum for the system of two angular momenta of j1 and j2 are j = j1 + j2, j1 + j2-1, . . ., |j1-j2| according to quantum mechanics [13]. It should be noted that the structure of two electrons in 2p orbitals is the same as that of four electrons in 2p orbitals because the structure of four electrons is equivalent to the closed-shell structure (six electrons in 2p orbitals as L = S = 0) minus the structure of two electrons in 2p orbitals [12]. The orbitals for L = 0, 1, 2, 3, .. are referred to as S, P, D, F, .. [14]. When there are two parallel spin electrons as in the left side of Fig. 6, L = 2 is impossible due to Pauli’s exclusion principle because the orbital angular momenta are also in parallel [15]. It is known that L = 0 is also impossible for this case due to Pauli’s exclusion principle [12]. Thus, the ground state of O atom is for L = 1 and designated 3P where the total spin angular momentum S is coded in the form of 2S + 1 in the left superscript. The ﬁrst excited state of O atom is 1D, because with the same multiplicity of 1 (S = 0) the conﬁguration with the highest total orbital angular momentum (L) has the lowest energy (Fig. 6). For the ﬁrst excited state, one of the 2p orbitals is empty. Thus, it is more easy to undergo bond-forming addition reactions than the ground\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n9\n\nFig. 7 Three regions for a cavitation bubble\n\nstate O atom. For example, the following reaction with water molecules is known to be very fast: O 1 D þ H2 O ! H2 O2 :\n\n(1)\n\nThe rate constant for the reaction (1) with H2O vapor is reported as 1:8 0:8 1010 L/(mol s) [16]. If the rate constant is the same for the same reaction in liquid water, then the lifetime of O(1D) in liquid water is about 1012 s = 1 ps. The diffusion pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ length of O atom in this lifetime is only about 0.1 nm which is estimated by 2 Dτ where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of O atom in liquid water (109 m2/s is assumed) and τ is the lifetime of O atom. Thus, O(1D) atom could be present only in the gas–liquid interface region of a bubble (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the ground state O(3P) is a selective oxidant because it rather slowly reacts with molecules that have no unpaired electrons such as H2O because such reactions violate the principle of spin conservation. With molecules that have unpaired electrons, O(3P) rapidly reacts. However, detailed reactivity and synthetic studies in solution are limited by lack of convenient and reliable methods for the generation and detection of O(3P) [17]. With regard to OH radical, the lifetime in solution is determined by the following reaction when the concentration of other solutes is not high: OH þ OH ! H2 O2 :\n\n(2)\n\n10\n\nK. Yasui\n\nThe rate constant is 5 109 L/(mol s). Thus the lifetime of OH radical in solution is determined by the concentration of OH radicals in this case. When [OH] is 5 103 mol/L [4], the lifetime of OH radical is 4 108s = 40 ns. When the concentration of other solutes is high, the lifetime of OH radical in solution is determined by the solute concentration. When it is 1 mol/L, the lifetime of OH radical in solution is 109–108 s = 1 ns – 10 ns because the rate constant is typically in the range of 108 to 109 L/(mol s). In the lifetime of 40 ns, the diffusion length of OH radical is about 10 nm. Thus OH radicals could be present only in the gas–liquid interface region (Fig. 7). With regard to H2O2, the lifetime in solution strongly depends on the kind of solutes present. Without any solutes, H2O2 has a lifetime much longer than 30 min determined by the rate of the following reaction [18]: H2 O2 ! 1=2 O2 þ H2 O:\n\n(3)\n\nIn the presence of OH radical, the following reaction takes place: OH þ H2 O2 ! H2 O þ O2 þ Hþ\n\n(4)\n\nThe rate constant of the reaction is ð2:7 0:3Þ 107 L/(mol s) [19]. When the concentration of OH is 5 103 mol/L, then the lifetime of H2O2 is 7.4 μs. As the lifetime of OH is only 40 ns at this concentration, the time-averaged concentration of OH should be much lower. If it is 106 mol/L, then the lifetime of H2O2 is as long as about 40 ms. The diffusion length of H2O2 in this lifetime is about 10 μm. Thus H2O2 could be present not only in the gas–liquid interface region but also in the liquid region. If there are other kinds of radicals derived from solutes such as methanol by the reaction with OH radicals, however, the rate constant for the reaction of H2O2 is as high as 108–109 L/(mol s). Then the lifetime is as short as that of OH radical. Physical and chemical properties of the gas–liquid interface region of a cavitation bubble are still under debate. Suslick et al. [20] suggested based on the experimental results of the vapor pressure dependence of sonochemical reaction rate at 20 kHz that the temperature of the gas–liquid interface region is as high as 1900 K. They also numerically calculated the temporal and spatial evolution of the liquid-zone temperature with a heat transport model. The model predicts a spatial and temporal average liquid-zone temperature of 2730 K. Furthermore, it predicts the width and the duration for the high temperature in the gas–liquid interface region as 200 nm and 2 μs, respectively. The author [21, 22] numerically calculated the temperature at the gas–liquid interface region based on a simple model. The model predicts the temperature at the gas–liquid interface increases up to the same order of magnitude with the maximum temperature inside a bubble (a few thousand Kelvin). The thickness and the duration for the high temperature region at the gas–liquid interface are estimated as only 4–10 nm and 2–6 ns, respectively. Further studies are required on this topic.\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n11\n\nNot only experimentally but also numerically, chemical reactions of radicals in solution (liquid phase) have not yet been fully studied with regard to an acoustic cavitation bubble (sonochemistry). With regard to advanced oxidation processes such as O3/H2O2, ultraviolet light/H2O2, and ultraviolet light/TiO2, there are some numerical studies on the chemical reactions of OH radicals in solution [23]. Numerical simulations of chemical reactions in solution are required in sonochemistry.\n\nOH Line Emission in Sonoluminescence When H2 gas reacts with O2 gas in combustion, ultraviolet light is emitted by OH radicals. The wavelength of the light is about 310 nm, which is called OH line because the spectrum of the light is not continuum but a line (Fig. 8) [24]. The OH line emission in sonoluminescence could be observed through a quartz ﬂask because the absorption of the light (310 nm) by a quartz ﬂask is negligible (Fig. 9) [25]. There are two types in sonoluminescence [1, 26]. One is single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) which is the light emission from a single stable bubble trapped near the pressure antinode of a standing ultrasonic wave in liquid by the acoustic radiation force called primary Bjerknes force. In SBSL, pulses of light are emitted periodically from a bubble with the period of ultrasound in a clocklike manner [27]. The other is multibubble sonoluminescence (MBSL) which is the light emission from a lot of bubbles in acoustic cavitation irrespective of standing or traveling ultrasonic waves. In MBSL, multiple pulses of light are periodically emitted with a half period of OH*\n\n1.0\n\nNormalized Intensity\n\n0.28\n\n0.8\n\nSingle Bubble, expanded scale 0.23 580\n\n0.6\n\n590\n\n600\n\nNa* 0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nSingle Bubble Multi-Bubble 300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\nWavelength (nm) Fig. 8 Comparison of the background subtracted spectra of multibubble and single-bubble sonoluminescence in a 0.1 M sodium chloride solution (Reprinted ﬁgure with permission from Matula et al.

It was reported that the OH line was not observed in SBSL but observed in MBSL in aqueous solutions (Fig. 8). From very dark SBSL, however, the OH line was observed with an exposure of 5 days to a spectrometer, while spectra could be observed with an exposure of 100 min from bright SBSL (Fig. 10) [28]. In a dark room, bright SBSL could be seen with naked eyes like a star in a ﬂask. Actually, the temperature inside a SBSL bubble increases to about 10,000 K at the end of the bubble collapse, which is similar to the\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation Fig. 11 The potentials for the A and X electronic states of OH (Reprinted with permission from Luque and Crosley [29].

The OH line at about 310 nm in wavelength is emitted when electrons in the ﬁrst excited state (A state) of OH radical are de-excited to the ground state (X state). It is called OH (A–X) band because both A and X states have various vibrational and rotational states of OH (Fig. 11) [29, 30]. The ground state of electrons in a molecule is usually labeled X, and the excited states are labeled A, B, C, . . .[13]. According to quantum mechanics, vibrational states of a molecule are quantized as 0,1,2,3,. . . (Fig. 11). The rotational states of a molecule are also quantized as J = 0,1,2,3,. . ., while they are not shown in Fig. 11 because the rotational energy levels (104–102 eV) are much lower than that of the vibrational energy levels (0.1–1 eV) [14, 31]. The electronic energy levels are in several eV which correspond to the energy of visible to ultraviolet light. The vibrational energy corresponds to the energy of infrared light. The rotational energy corresponds to that of microwave. It should be noted that the energy of electromagnetic wave (light) is hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant (6.6 1034 J s), c is the speed of light (3.0 108 m/s), λ is the wavelength of light in meter, and 1 eV = 1.6 1019 J.

The band has never been observed in normal combustion, while it has been observed in discharge\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n15\n\nFig. 13 Normalized MBSL spectra from water sparged with argon at 10–11 C for different ultrasonic frequencies (Reprinted ﬁgure with permission from Ndiaye et al.

[32] suggested that OH was excited to the third excited state by collisions with high-energy electrons created inside a bubble. It may be an evidence of the plasma formation inside a bubble under the condition of MBSL. The plasma formation inside a SBSL bubble in sulfuric acid has been experimentally conﬁrmed by the observation of the emission lines of Ar+ and O2+ [33, 34]. The difference and the similarity between SBSL and MBSL are still under debate and should be studied further in future. Pﬂieger et al. [32] also found that OH emission depends on the noble gas species dissolved in water (Fig. 12). From Xe bubbles, the OH (C–A) band is stronger than OH (A–X) band. On the other hand, from Ar bubbles, the OH (A–X) band is stronger than OH (C–A) band. The reason may be the larger number of high-energy electrons inside a Xe bubble due to lower ionization potential and higher temperature compared to Ar caused by lower thermal conductivity of Xe resulting in a smaller amount of thermal conduction from the heated interior of a bubble to the surrounding liquid. Pﬂieger et al. [32] also found that OH line emission depends also on ultrasonic frequency (Fig. 12). The detailed mechanisms are, however, still under debate. In 2012, Ndiaye et al. [35] in the same research group of Pﬂieger and Nikitenko derived the vibrational population distribution of OH (A 2Σ+) from the analysis of the OH (A–X) band in MBSL spectra (Figs. 13 and 14). They also reported the dependence of the vibrational population distribution on ultrasonic frequency. They concluded that the vibrational population distribution deviated strongly from the\n\n16\n\nK.

For equilibration, molecules and radicals need enough number of collisions among them. The number of collisions necessary to provide equilibrium distributions from strongly perturbed thermodynamic states of an assembly of particles is in the order of 10 for translational motion of particles [36]. It is in the order of 103 and 105 collisions for rotational and vibrational motion, respectively. For excitation and dissociation of molecules and radicals, it is in the order of 107. For ionization, it is in the order of 109. Inside a sonoluminescing bubble, the concentration of molecules\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n17\n\nand radicals is in the same order of magnitude as that of the condensed phase (liquid state) and about 3 1028 m3. When the temperature inside a bubble is 104 K, the average velocity of each molecule is about 3 103 m/s. Then, the frequency of collision for each molecule or radical is about 5 1013 s1 = 1.4 0.4 1018 m2 (cross section of a molecule or radical) 3 103 m/s (mean velocity) 3 1028 m3 (number density). The time scale for the temperature change inside a sonoluminescing bubble is in the order of 0.1 ns = 1010 s. Thus, the number of collisions of a molecule or a radical is about 5 103 during the time. It is enough for equilibration of translational and rotational motion of molecules and radicals. However, it may be insufﬁcient for the equilibration of vibrational population of molecules or radicals. Thus, it is possible that vibrational population distribution is in nonequilibrium inside a sonoluminescing bubble. According to the experimentally derived distribution of vibrational population of OH (A 2Σ+) inside sonoluminescing bubbles in Fig. 14, the population increases as the vibrational quantum number increases at relatively high quantum number. One of the examples of such distribution is the Treanor distribution (Fig. 15) [37]. The Treanor distribution is realized when the vibrational temperature is higher than the translational temperature of molecules for anharmonic oscillator (molecule) with decreasing energy interval between successive vibrational states for increasing quantum number for vibration. In this case, excitation and de-excitation of vibrational states of two colliding molecules are not in resonance when one of the molecules is in highly excited state of vibration and the other is in much lower energy state of vibration because the energy interval of successive states is quite different between them due to anharmonic nature of molecular vibration. For the excitation of the lower energy state of molecular vibration, not only the de-excitation of highly excited vibrational state but also the decrease of the energy of the translational motion is required. As a result, when the temperature of the translational motion is much lower than the temperature of the molecular vibration, the upper levels of vibration are overpopulated compared to a Boltzmann distribution. This is the Treanor distribution. There are some other similar distributions such as Brau and Bray distributions [38–40]. Inside a sonoluminescing bubble, the vibrational temperature may become higher than the translational temperature when a bubble re-expands after the violent collapse because the translational temperature may decrease faster. Then, could the Treanor distribution be realized during the re-expansion of a bubble after the violent collapse? According to the numerical simulations by An and Li [41], however, the OH emission is expected during the bubble collapse when the bubble internal temperature increases (Fig. 16). Thus further studies are required on whether the vibrational population distribution is really the Treanor one or not. If yes, why is the translational temperature lower than the vibrational temperature? One possibility is the excitation of vibrational states of OH by chemical reactions. In this case, the electronic excitation of OH is also due to chemical reactions, and OH emission is chemiluminescence. It is widely known that molecular vibration is preferentially excited through some kinds of chemical reactions [14].

When the temperature inside such a bubble is as high as 104 K, molecules including electronically excited ones undergo many collisions. Then, non-radiative de-excitation, for which the energy is transferred to heat instead of light, takes place dominantly. It is called quenching. Thus, for strong radiative de-excitation, much more molecules should be electronically excited than the molecules undergoing non-radiative de-excitation (quenching). It may be only possible through chemical reactions. For OH, the following chemical reactions could produce electronically excited OH (OH*): O + H + M ! OH* + M and OH + H + OH ! OH* + H2O [3, 42].\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n19\n\nFig. 16 The results of the numerical simulations for a Xe bubble in 20 C water.

Furthermore, Pﬂieger et al. [44] reported that the rotational temperature is signiﬁcantly lower than the vibrational temperature for C2 radicals which were determined from C2 emission spectra of MBSL in aqueous t-BuOH solution (Fig. 18). The reason for the lower rotational temperature is, however, still under debate and should be studied in future. In MBSL, there are a variety of bubbles which have different temperatures at the bubble collapse. Thus molecular emissions such as OH emissions could be from bubbles of different temperatures. In addition, even for a speciﬁed bubble, the temperature inside a bubble temporally changes dramatically (Fig. 3a). Thus the molecular emissions from bubbles are possibly at different temperatures. It may be one of the reasons for non-Boltzmann distribution for vibrational population of OH inside a SL bubble. However, the increase of population with the increase of the vibrational quantum number could not be explained by this effect. It suggests that vibrational population inside an SL bubble is actually in nonequilibrium.\n\n20\n\nK.

The acoustic cavitation bubbles strongly attenuate ultrasound and radiate acoustic waves into the surrounding liquid by their pulsations. Furthermore, the bubbles move by acoustic radiation forces. The speed of sound could be changed by the presence of bubbles. In addition, the walls of the liquid container vibrate due to the pressure oscillation of\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\n21\n\nultrasound. As a result, the walls radiate acoustic waves into the liquid. The liquid surface also vibrates under ultrasound. At the present stage, the whole system is not fully understood both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we discuss the role of the vibration of the container’s wall as well as the attenuation of ultrasound by bubbles by the FEM calculations of an acoustic ﬁeld in a sonochemical reactor [45]. The basic equation is the wave equation (Eq. 5) with the boundary condition (Eq. 6): ∇2 p\n\n1 @2p ¼0 c2 @t2\n\n@p @ 2 un ¼ ρ 2 @n @t\n\n(5) (6)\n\n@ @ @ where ∇2 ¼ @x 2 þ @y2 þ @z2 , p is the oscillatory component of the pressure, c is the velocity of sound, t is time, n is the length in the direction perpendicular to the boundary and is deﬁned as positive in the direction into the liquid, ρ is the liquid density, and un is the displacement of the boundary (wall) in the direction perpendicular to the boundary. In the FEM calculations, the equations are expressed by an integral equation as follows: 2\n\nð V\n\n2\n\n2\n\nð 1 @2p @p @ 2 un 2 þ ρ 2 dΓ ¼ 0 W ∇ p 2 2 dV þ W c @t @n @t\n\n(7)\n\nΓ\n\nwhere V is the total volume of the liquid, W is an arbitrary weighting function, Γ is the boundary between the liquid and the solid (wall), and n is deﬁned to be positive in the direction into the liquid. The solution of Eqs. 5 and 6 (p and un) automatically satisﬁes Eq. 7. It is an approximation that the solution of Eq. 7 (p and un) is regarded as that of Eqs. 5 and 6, which is called the method of weighted residuals. The method to solve Eq. 7 in the FEM calculations is described in Refs. [45, 46]. The calculations have been performed for a rectangular cell of 7 cm 7 cm 20 cm in internal dimensions ﬁlled with water at 20 C [45]. The bottom of the cell is a vibrating plate which vibrates at frequency of 100 kHz, and the spatial distribution of its vibration amplitude has been assumed as a Gaussian distribution. At the center of the vibrating plate, the vibration amplitude has the maximum value of 0.1 μm. The liquid height is assumed as 13.9 cm unless stated, which is close to a resonance height of 13.875 cm. As the boundary condition, the applied pressure is assumed as zero (the free boundary condition) at the outer surface of the reactor’s wall and the liquid surface. From the symmetry of the rectangular reactor, only 1/8 of the total volume has been considered in the calculation. In Fig. 19, the calculated spatial distribution of the acoustic amplitude (the pressure amplitude) has been shown for the rigid wall and the glass wall (2 mm or 7 mm in thickness). The half width of the Gaussian distribution of the vibration amplitude has been assumed as 5 cm, while the side length of the vibrating plate is\n\n22\n\nK.

The white and black regions show the region of the highest acoustic amplitude (pressure antinode) and that of zero (pressure node), respectively. At the liquid surface, the acoustic amplitude is always zero (pressure node) and shown with black line. At the vibrating plate at the bottom, it is a pressure antinode and shown with white because in this calculations the liquid height is nearly that of resonance. For the liquid container with thin glass walls (2 mm in thickness), the walls vibrate nearly freely. Thus, the pressure amplitude near the wall is nearly zero (pressure node) as seen in the middle of Fig. 19. For a thicker glass wall of 7 mm, on the other hand, the vibration of the wall is much less. As a result, the acoustic amplitude near the wall is not necessarily small although the vibration of the wall alters the acoustic ﬁeld from the pure stripes seen in the case of the rigid wall. The acoustic ﬁeld also depends on the material of the wall. The glass wall vibrates more strongly than the stainless steel wall when the thickness of the wall is the same (Fig. 20). In other words, the glass wall is freer than the stainless steel wall. As a result, the acoustic amplitude near the glass wall is lower than that near the stainless steel wall. The acoustic ﬁeld strongly depends on the attenuation coefﬁcient of ultrasound. At 100 kHz, the attenuation coefﬁcient of ultrasound is only 2 104 m1 without any bubbles in liquid water. However, with some amount of bubbles, the attenuation coefﬁcient signiﬁcantly becomes higher [47]. In Fig. 21, the calculated acoustic ﬁelds are shown for various attenuation coefﬁcients of ultrasound. In the present calculations, the speed of sound in liquid water is assumed as constant, and its\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation Fig. 20 The calculated spatial distribution of the acoustic amplitude for stainless steel wall and glass wall.

Without any bubbles, the acoustic ﬁeld is strongly perturbed by the vibration of the wall as seen in the right side of Fig. 21. The strongly vibrating wall radiates strong acoustic waves (ultrasound) into the liquid and strongly alters the acoustic ﬁeld. As the attenuation coefﬁcient increases, the effect of the vibration of the wall becomes smaller because the vibration amplitude of the wall decreases due to the decrease in acoustic amplitude. When the attenuation coefﬁcient is larger than about 0.05 m1, the nearly stripe structure of the acoustic ﬁeld is recovered. The photograph of sonochemiluminescence from an aqueous luminol solution shows the spatial distribution of OH radicals as well as H2O2 created by bubbles because the light emission is due to the chemical reaction of luminol with OH radical and H2O2 [48]. The spatial distribution of OH radicals reﬂects that of active bubbles. The spatial distribution of active bubbles reﬂects that of acoustic amplitude. Thus the photograph nearly shows the acoustic ﬁeld. For the attenuation coefﬁcient of 0.5–5 m1, the calculated acoustic ﬁeld is similar to the spatial pattern of sonochemiluminescence because some horizontal stripes of pressure antinodes are disconnected. It suggests that under the experimental condition of sonochemiluminescence in Fig. 21, the attenuation coefﬁcient in a bubbly liquid water is in the range of 0.5–5 m1. According to Dahnke and Keil [47], the attenuation coefﬁcient of 0.5–5 m1 at 100 kHz corresponds to the value for liquid water with the bubble volume fraction of 103–102. In Fig. 22, the calculated results for the liquid height of resonance (13.875 cm) as well as that of antiresonance (14.25 cm) at 100 kHz are shown for rigid walls. For the both cases, the liquid surface corresponds to pressure node. For the case of resonance, the vibrating plate at the bottom corresponds to pressure antinode. On the other hand, for the case of antiresonance, it corresponds to the pressure node. Even for the case of antiresonance, a clear stripe pattern of an acoustic ﬁeld is seen,\n\n24\n\nK.

The solid line shows the pressure amplitude of ultrasound normalized with the amplitude of the reﬂected wave at the liquid surface at the right end of Fig. 23 as a function of the distance (x) from the vibrating plate in unit of kx/π where k is the wave number of ultrasound. Such an acoustic ﬁeld is called a damped standing wave ﬁeld [49]. A damped standing wave is composed of both traveling and standing waves. The straight line in Fig. 23 shows the traveling wave component. The percentage of the ﬁeld which is the standing wave may be estimated by the following quantity [50]: ðPant Pnod Þ 100 % ðPant þ Pnod Þ\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Pant is the acoustic amplitude at the pressure antinode, and Pnod is that at the pressure node (Fig. 23). The value depends on the distance from the vibrating plate (or liquid surface) as seen in Fig. 23.

Yasui\n\nOne of the problems in the present FEM calculations is the neglect of acoustic emissions from cavitation bubbles. In the presence of bubbles, the wave equation (Eq. 5) should be modiﬁed as follows [51, 52]: ∇2 p\n\nX @2Vi 1 @2p ¼ ρ Ni 2 l c2 @t2 @t i\n\n(10)\n\nwhere ρl is the liquid density, Ni is the number density of bubbles for a group i with the same bubble radius, and Vi is the volume of a bubble for a group i. In general, Ni ! and Vi are a function of the position ( r ) and time (t). The volume of a bubble is related to the bubble radius (Ri) as V i ¼ 4πR3i =3. The bubble radius is calculated by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation (Eq. 11) or its modiﬁed version (Eq. 12) [2]: Ri R€i þ\n\n2 ! 3R_i 1 2σ 4μR_i ¼ pg p0 p r, t ρl Ri 2 Ri\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the over-dot denotes the time derivative (d/dt), pg is the pressure inside a bubble, σ is the surface tension, μ is viscosity, p0 is the ambient static pressure, and !\n\np r , t is the acoustic pressure which is the solution of Eq. 10:\n\n2 R_i R_i 3R_i 1 € 1 ð3Λ þ 1Þ 1 ð Λ þ 1Þ R i Ri þ 3 c 2 c R dp R_i 1 ! i B (12) 1 þ ð1 Λ Þ ¼ pB p r , t p0 þ ρl c cρl dt where Λ is an arbitrary constant which satisﬁes jΛj < c=R_i ( Λ ¼ 0 for Keller equation, and Λ ¼ 1 for Herring equation), and pB is the liquid pressure at the bubble _\n\n4μRi wall (pB ¼ pg 2σ Ri Ri ). Another problem is that in actual experiments, the liquid surface vibrates when the liquid is irradiated by ultrasound (Fig. 24). According to Tuziuti et al. [53], when the vibration amplitude of the liquid surface exceeds a quarter wavelength of ultrasound, the sonochemiluminescence (SCL) intensity strongly drops. The reason is probably the strong disturbance of a standing wave ﬁeld by the liquid surface vibration. However, the inﬂuence of the liquid surface vibration on an acoustic ﬁeld has not yet been fully studied as well as the physics of liquid surface vibration. Another problem is the inﬂuence of pulsed ultrasound on an acoustic ﬁeld. According to Tuziuti et al. [54], the spatial distribution of SCL intensity is strongly altered by using pulsed ultrasound (Fig. 25). With continuous ultrasound, the spatial distribution of SCL intensity is strongly inhomogeneous (Fig. 25d). On the other hand, with pulsed ultrasound (100 cycle On – 100 cycle OFF), the spatial distribution of SCL intensity is much more homogeneous (Fig. 25a). It is known that with pulsed ultrasound, the number of large degassing bubbles is much less than that with\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\na\n\nDisplacement Sensor\n\nRectangular glass vessel\n\nLaser Beam\n\n60mm\n\n80mm\n\nOscilloscope\n\nt 2mm Floating Thin Film Reflector\n\nSonaChemiLuminescence\n\nTransducer Power Amplifier\n\nPhotoMultiplier Tube\n\nFunction Generator\n\nb\n\nc\n\nLens\n\nCavitation 64mm Bubbles\n\nAir-saturated Liquid(200mL) Power Meter\n\n27\n\n10 mm\n\n0.5\n\nDisplacement (mm)\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0 7000\n\n7500\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\nTime(ms)\n\nFig. 24 The vibration of liquid surface by ultrasound irradiation.

However, detailed mechanism for the inﬂuence of degassing bubbles on the acoustic ﬁeld has not yet been fully studied. Finally, the bubble–bubble interaction is discussed (Fig. 26). Each pulsating bubble radiates acoustic waves into the surrounding liquid. It is like the sound radiation from a vibrating plate. The inﬂuence of acoustic waves which radiated from surrounding bubbles on the pulsation of a bubble is called the bubble–bubble interaction. The strength of the bubble–bubble interaction may be characterized by the following quantity named the coupling strength (S): lmax ð X 1 4πr 2 n S¼ dr ¼ 2πn l2max l2min 2πnl2max ; ¼ d r i i\n\n(13)\n\nlmin\n\nwhere di is the distance between the bubble and another bubble numbered i, the summation is for all the surrounding bubbles, lmin is the distance between the bubble and the nearest bubble, lmax is the radius of the bubble cloud, n is the number density of bubbles, r is the distance from the bubble, and it is assumed that lmax >> lmin in the last equation. The coupling strength (S) can be experimentally estimated by measuring the number density of bubbles (n) and the radius of the bubble cloud (lmax). The reason for the importance of this quantity is as follows. The pressure ( pi) of an acoustic wave which is radiated from a pulsating bubble is given by Eq. 14:\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation\n\nacoustic waves radiated from bubbles\n\n29\n\nbubbles ultrasound\n\nFig. 26 The bubble–bubble interaction. Pulsation of a bubble is inﬂuenced by acoustic waves radiated by surrounding bubbles\n\npi ¼\n\nρl 2 € R R þ 2RR_2 ri\n\n(14)\n\nwhere ri is the distance from the bubble, and R is the instantaneous bubble radius. In Eq. 14, however, the time delay effect due to a ﬁnite speed of acoustic propagation is neglected. This approximation is valid only when the time delay (r/c) is much smaller than the acoustic period. The total pressure (P) of acoustic waves from all the surrounding bubbles is just the total sum of Eq. 14: N N X X 1 P¼ pi ¼ ρl R2 R€ þ 2RR_2 r i¼1 i¼1 i\n\n! (15)\n\nwhere it is assumed that the bubble radius is the same for all the bubbles. This approximation as well as the approximation of the spatially homogenous distribution of bubbles used in Eq. 13 is called the homogenous bubble-cloud approximation. Under this approximation, Eq. 15 becomes Eq. 16 using Eq. 13: P ¼ ρl S R2 R€ þ 2RR_2 :\n\n(16)\n\nThus, it is proportional to the coupling strength S. Under this approximation, ! p r , t in Eq. 12 is expressed as Eq. 17: ! p r , t ¼ pa sin ωt þ ρl S R2 R€ þ 2RR_2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere pa is the pressure amplitude of ultrasound, ω is the angular frequency of ultrasound, and t is time. Thus, the factor S characterizes the strength of the bubble–bubble interaction and is called coupling strength of bubbles. In Fig. 27, the results of numerical simulations under the approximation of Eq. 15 are shown for the radius-time curves for various values of S. The bubble expansion is more strongly suppressed by the bubble–bubble interaction for a larger value of S.\n\n30 350 S=0 300\n\nBubble radius (μm)\n\nFig. 27 Results of numerical simulations on the radius-time curves for various coupling strength (S) of bubbles.

In Fig. 28, the resonance frequency of an encapsulated microbubble used as a contrast agent in medical applications (Albunex) is also shown. For both uncovered bubble (free bubble) and encapsulated microbubble, the resonance frequency decreases as S increases above 105 m1 due to stronger bubble–bubble interaction. Up to date, there has been no full numerical study of Eq. 10 taking into account the nonuniform spatial distribution of bubbles; wide distribution of bubble size (ambient bubble radii); movement of bubbles by radiation forces; temporal ﬂuctuation in the number density of bubbles by fragmentation, dissolution, and coalescence of bubbles [55]; vibration of the container’s wall [45]; vibration of the liquid surface [53]; presence of large degassing bubbles [54]; etc. Such studies are required in future as well as experimental measurements of acoustic ﬁelds.\n\nConclusion and Future Directions It has long been believed that the main oxidant created by acoustic cavitation bubbles in aqueous solutions is OH radical. According to the numerical simulations [5], however, the main oxidant is not always OH radical but sometimes H2O2 and O atom. For vaporous bubbles for which the main bubble content at the bubble collapse is water vapor, the main oxidant is OH radical according to the numerical simulations. On the other hand, for gaseous bubbles for which the main bubble content at the bubble collapse is permanent gas such as air, the main oxidant is H2O2 when the bubble temperature at the collapse ranges from 4000 K to 6500 K. When the bubble temperature is higher than 6500 K in gaseous bubbles, the main oxidant is O atom.\n\nUnsolved Problems in Acoustic Cavitation 8\n\n10\n\nAlbunex\n\n107 ω0 (rad/s)\n\nFig. 28 The relationship between the coupling strength (S) of bubbles and the resonance frequency of a bubble (angular frequency ω0).

Up to date, there has been no experimental conﬁrmation on the presence of O atom in liquid water produced by bubbles. As the lifetime of O atom is expected to be very short, it may be only in the gas–liquid interface region of a bubble. In addition, the temperature as well as pressure of the gas–liquid interface region at the bubble collapse is still under debate. Numerical and experimental studies on the lifetime of O atom in the gas–liquid interface are required in future. The experimental observation of OH line emission in multibubble sonoluminescence suggests that vibrational states of OH are in nonequilibrium inside a bubble at the collapse. The upper levels of OH vibration are overpopulated inside a bubble compared to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. Under some conditions, the population increases as the vibrational quantum number increases at relatively high quantum number. Such population could be realized when the translational temperature is much lower than the vibrational temperature known as Treanor distribution. Is the distribution of OH vibrational population inside an SL bubble really Treanor distribution? If yes, why is the translational temperature is much lower than the vibrational temperature? One possibility is that OH vibration is highly excited through chemical reactions inside a bubble. In this case, OH line emission could be due to chemiluminescence. Further studies are required on this topic. The acoustic ﬁeld inside a sonochemical reactor is not fully understood because bubbles strongly attenuate acoustic waves and radiate acoustic waves into the surrounding liquid. In addition, bubbles spatially move and the spatial distribution of bubbles is strongly inhomogeneous. The number of bubbles temporally changes by fragmentation, coalescence, and dissolution [55]. The vibration of the container’s wall affects the acoustic ﬁeld inside a sonochemical reactor because it radiates acoustic waves into the liquid [45]. The liquid surface also vibrates under ultrasound,\n\n32\n\nK. Yasui\n\nwhich inﬂuences the reﬂection of an ultrasonic wave at the liquid surface [53]. The experiments using pulsed ultrasound suggest that large degassing bubbles strongly alter an acoustic ﬁeld [54]. Further studies are required on the acoustic ﬁeld inside a sonochemical reactor both experimentally and numerically.\n\nReferences 1. Yasui K, Tuziuti T, Sivakumar M, Iida Y (2004) Sonoluminescence.

The latter plays an important role in a ﬁeld of high acoustic pressure. The ﬁrst part of this chapter discusses the highspeed observation of bubbles interacting with other bubbles. The theory of bubble-bubble interactions in an acoustic ﬁeld is brieﬂy described, and highspeed images representing bubble coalescence are presented. The bubble oscillation and bubble size are shown to be affected by surfactant molecules adsorbed at the bubble/liquid interface. The high-speed images indicate spherical bubble oscillation and a smaller size distribution upon adding sodium dodecyl sulfate.

The second part deals with the dependence of bubble dynamics on the acoustic power in association with the variation of SL intensity. The method of acoustic power measurement is described. The intensity of SL (sonochemiluminescence, SCL) takes a maximum value at certain acoustic power at both 84 and 138 kHz. The high-speed shadowgraphy of bubbles revealed a transition from a bubble streamer to a cluster with increasing the power. The bubble cluster was found to be composed of a large nonspherical bubble and tiny bubbles that exhibit transient oscillation. The emergence of the bubble cluster is the main cause of the reduction in the SL (SCL) intensity.

A bubble nucleus adhering to dust particles in a liquid or to a container wall grows into a small bubble through the rectiﬁed diffusion of gas dissolved in the liquid under acoustic pressure. Some growing bubbles may dissolve in the liquid because of surface tension, and other bubbles may further grow into collapsing bubbles that oscillate violently. A collapsing bubble may cause nonspherical oscillation because of its strong nonlinearity, leading to fragmentation into small bubbles. Collapsing bubbles may cause each other to coalesce via the secondary Bjerknes force that acts between bubbles, and sometimes form a streamer. The conditions inside a collapsing bubble are a high temperature and a high pressure, which may result in light emission and hydroxyl (OH) radical production. OH radicals decomposed from water molecules transfer through the bubble/liquid interface and interact with foreign molecules surrounding the bubble. Further increase in acoustic pressure enhances the secondary Bjerknes force, resulting in the formation of bubble clusters. The recent improvement of high-speed imaging techniques is helpful for understanding acoustic bubble oscillations and bubble-bubble interactions [1, 2]. The ﬁrst part of this chapter gives a survey of bubble-bubble interactions followed by the experimental results of high-speed observation. We present high-speed images of bubble coalescence under the condition of an acoustic ﬁeld, in which multibubble sonoluminescence (SL) can be observed. The effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant on bubble oscillations and the distribution of the maximum bubble size are shown at a frequency of 82 kHz for various SDS concentrations. Bubble-bubble interactions greatly change with the applied acoustic power. In the second part of this chapter, after introducing the fundamentals of acoustic power\n\nAcoustic Bubbles and Sonoluminescence\n\n3\n\nmeasurements, we describe how SL and sonochemiluminescence (SCL) intensities depend on the acoustic power under various conditions of acoustic ﬁelds and how the bubble dynamics as collective motion depends on the acoustic power in association with the SL intensity.\n\nInteractions of a Bubble with an Acoustic Field and Another Bubble Primary and Secondary Bjerknes Forces The fundamentals of cavitation bubble dynamics are described in books by Young [3], Leighton [4], and Brennen [5]. The physics of bubble oscillations and recent works on this topic have been thoroughly reviewed by Lauterborn and Kurz [6]. Bubbles generated in a strong acoustic ﬁeld self-organize into structured ensembles in the form of ﬁlamentary patterns (sometimes called “streamers”) [7–9] or clusters [10] consisting of many bubbles, depending on the acoustic power and frequency. These structures are formed by the attractive and repulsive forces generated by bubble-bubble interactions. The interaction force of a bubble with an acoustic ﬁeld is called the primary Bjerknes force. The time-averaged Bjerknes force on a spherically oscillating bubble under acoustic pressure p(x, t) is given by FB ¼ hV ðtÞ∇pðx, tÞi;\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V ðtÞ ¼ ð4π=3ÞR3 is the bubble volume and R is the bubble radius. The brackets 〈〉 indicate a time average over an acoustic cycle. We consider a bubble located at position x in a standing-wave pressure ﬁeld of the form pðx, tÞ ¼ Pa sin kx cos ωt ;\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Pa is the pressure amplitude, k is the wavenumber, and ω is the angular frequency of the acoustic ﬁeld. If the pressure amplitude is not very large, the bubble radius oscillates as RðtÞ ¼ R0 A sin kx cos ðωt þ αÞ ;\n\n(3)\n\nwhere α is the phase difference between the pressure and bubble radius oscillation, which equals zero for bubbles smaller than the resonance radius or π for bubbles larger than the resonance radius. R0 is the equilibrium radius in the case of no acoustic ﬁeld, and A denotes the amplitude of radial oscillation. Then the Bjerknes force (Eq. 1) can be calculated as FB ¼\n\n3APa kV 0 sin 2kx cos α ; 4R0\n\n(4)\n\n4\n\nP.-K. Choi\n\nwhere V 0 ¼ ð4=3ÞπR30 . Equation 4 shows that bubbles smaller than the resonant radius are subjected to a force directed toward a pressure antinode and that bubbles larger than the resonant radius are subjected to a force directed toward a pressure node. Figure 1 illustrates how small bubbles tend to shift toward a pressure antinode. If the pressure amplitude is sufﬁciently large for the bubbles to continue expanding during the compression phase of the acoustic cycle, the bubbles are repelled from the antinode. This repulsion occurs when the pressure amplitude is larger than 1.8 atm at 20 kHz [11]. If two bubbles exist in the vicinity of each other, the oscillation of a bubble with volume V 1 ¼ ð4=3ÞπR31 produces pressure waves around the bubble that act as an additional force on the neighboring bubble. This is called the secondary Bjerknes force. Under a pressure gradient ∇p1 caused by the ﬁrst bubble, the second bubble of volume V 2 ¼ ð4=3ÞπR32 is subjected to the force F12 ¼ V 2 ∇p1 :\n\n(5)\n\nThe time average of Eq. 5 gives the net force FB2 ¼\n\nρ _ _ V 1 V 2 er ; 4πd 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the liquid, d is the distance between the two bubbles, and er denotes the radial unit vector.

According to these equations, a bubble smaller than the resonance radius and a bubble larger than the resonance radius repel each other, while pairs of bubbles smaller or larger than the resonance radius attract each other. Mettin et al. [12] numerically investigated the secondary Bjerknes force in a strong acoustic ﬁeld.

The white regions correspond to repulsion and the darker regions correspond to attraction between the two bubbles. The white regions become narrower when the two bubbles approach each other. The pairs of bubble radii corresponding to the white regions are smaller than the linear resonant radius, i.e., 0.15 mm at 20 kHz, which indicates an attractive force according to the linear theory expressed by Eq. 7. This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that the nonlinear resonance radius decreases with increasing pressure amplitude.\n\nHigh-Speed Observation of Two Interacting Bubbles Jiao et al. [14] experimentally and theoretically studied the translational motion of two approaching bubbles. They used a cylindrical Pyrex resonator equipped with a 22.4 kHz transducer to trap two bubbles, which were injected near a pressure antinode. The movements of the bubbles were recorded using a high-speed camera at a frame rate of 2000 fps. Their relative velocity was measured at various distances between the bubbles. The experimental result is shown in Fig. 3 together with theoretical values calculated from the secondary Bjerknes force and drag force.\n\nFig. 3 Relative velocity of two bubbles as a function of the distance between them for a pressure amplitude of 40 kPa.

The acoustic power is about 5 W, and the time interval between images is 2 μs\n\nThe Keller-Miksis equation, Eq. 8, was used to calculate the radial oscillation of the bubbles. The experimental and simulation results have a reasonably strong correlation as shown in Fig. 3. Choi and Deno [15] reported a high-speed movie of the coalescence of two bubbles interacting in a streamer in a standing-wave ﬁeld of 87 kHz in water. Figure 4 shows selected images from the movie, which was taken at a frame rate of 1 M fps. Bubble a, which is located in the upper left of frame 1, approaches bubble b, which remains at almost the same position, while both bubbles repeatedly undergo expansion and contraction. The maximum sizes of the two bubbles are 50 μm, and the minimum sizes are approximately 9 μm. In frames 6–9, bubble b exhibits shape oscillation, although it exhibits spherical oscillation in the next acoustic cycle in frames 12–14. Bubble a also exhibits shape oscillation in frames 30–32. The two bubbles ﬁnally coalesce in frame 34. Figure 5 shows the time dependencies of the distance between the centers of the two bubbles and their relative velocity. Equation 6 predicts that the Bjerknes force between the bubbles is strong when the bubble volumes change rapidly. The velocity increases with decreasing the distance of the bubbles, corresponding to the rapid contraction of the two bubbles. The result is well explained by Eq. 6. Several works on the oscillation of coated microbubbles, which are used in ultrasound contrast agents, have been reported. The nonspherical oscillation of a coated microbubble sonicated in the MHz range was observed by Versluis et al. [16], van der Meer et al. [17], and Dollet et al. [18]. Direct observations of the sonoporation of a viable cell membrane by cavitation bubbles [19] and coated microbubbles [20] were reported.\n\n8\n\nP.-K.

SL, sonochemistry, and acoustic emission have been used to monitor the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules, adsorbed at a bubble/liquid interface. The effects are manifested in several ways. First, the bubble growth rate increases because of the resulting resistance to gas transfer across the interface, especially during the collapse phase of a bubble oscillation [26]. The inhibition of bubble coalescence also occurs due to the electrostatic effect caused by the adsorption of charged surfactant molecules at the bubble/liquid interface. This inhibition produces a sharp decrease in total bubble volume in a multibubble ﬁeld [27]. The adsorption increases the number of active cavitation bubbles, which leads to the enhancement of multibubble SL, and also increases the symmetry of bubble oscillation, resulting in an increase in harmonic components in the acoustic emission spectrum [28]. A direct observation of the bubble oscillation in SDS solutions was reported by Deno and Choi [29]. Figure 6 shows the shadowgraph images of cavitating bubbles at their maximum sizes in water and 1 mM SDS solution captured with a high-speed camera (Shimadzu, HPV-2) at 1 M fps. The bubbles are streaming toward the lower right corner in a standing-wave ﬁeld of 125 kHz. The bubbles in water (a) exhibit nonspherical oscillations, and those in SDS solution (b) exhibit spherical oscillations, conﬁrming the speculation by Ashokkumar et al. [28], which was based on the acoustic emission spectrum.\n\nAcoustic Bubbles and Sonoluminescence\n\n9\n\nFig. 6 High-speed images of cavitation bubbles in water (a) and 1 mM SDS solution (b) sonicated at 125 kHz and an acoustic power of 20 W.

Diameters below 4.7 μm are plotted as zero\n\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the time sequences of bubble diameter were obtained from the high-speed images for water (blue) and 1 mM (green) and 5 mM (orange) SDS solutions at an ultrasonic frequency of 87 kHz. About 11 frames were captured in the period of ultrasound. Diameters below 4.7 μm are plotted as zero in these curves since the spatial resolution of the images was 4.7 μm. For water, oscillations with a shorter period appeared at compression phases. This was caused by the nonspherical oscillation of bubbles, which was observed very frequently in the high-speed movies. Conversely, for the 1 and 5 mM SDS solutions, the bubble oscillation curves in Fig. 7 resemble those obtained by the simulation of a single bubble.\n\n10\n\nP.-K. Choi\n\nThis suggests that spherical oscillations preferentially occur in surfactant-adsorbed bubbles, in agreement with the high-speed images. The spherical oscillations can be explained by two factors [28]. First, the adsorption of the surfactant at the bubble/ liquid interface dampens surface waves at the interface. Second, the electrostatic repulsion between bubbles leads to the “declustering” of the bubbles, which decreases the secondary Bjerknes force. The distribution of the bubble size is also affected by a surface-active solute. The maximum diameters of cavitating bubbles can be estimated from high-speed images. Figure 8 shows a histogram of the maximum diameter under 87 kHz ultrasound with an acoustic power of about 11 W. In Fig. 8a, the maximum bubble diameter in water is distributed from 9 to 66 μm with an average of 31 μm, which is indicated by the arrow in the ﬁgure. Figure 8b–e show the histograms for SDS solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mM, respectively. The range of the maximum diameter decreases with increasing SDS concentration up to 5 mM then increases at 10 mM. The average maximum bubble diameter at 5 mM is 21 μm, which is the smallest value among the solutions investigated. At the concentration of 5 mM, the number of bubbles with diameters larger than 40 μm is signiﬁcantly less than that in water. This is because bubble coalescence is inhibited when charged SDS molecules are adsorbed at the bubble/liquid interface. The direct observation of bubble oscillation demonstrated that the effects of SDS on bubble oscillation are most prominent at 5 mM, which is larger but in reasonable agreement with the value obtained by the observations of acoustic emission [28] and SL [30]. The effect of SDS adsorption may also depend on the acoustic frequency and power.\n\nSize Distribution of Sonoluminescence Bubbles Section “High-Speed Observation of Effects of Surfactant on Bubble Oscillations” describes the oscillations of bubbles regardless of the emission of SL. There is interest in the size of bubble that exhibits SL or SCL. Lee et al. [31] determined the size distribution of SL-emitting bubbles using a pulsed ultrasound at 515 kHz. They employed a 4 ms-duration (equivalent to 2060 cycles) ultrasound pulse so that a steady-state active bubble population is reached and a constant SL intensity is obtained. The active bubbles dissolve during a pulse off-time with a ﬁnite dissolution time depending on the initial bubble radius. If the successive ultrasonic pulses act upon the bubbles before the bubbles dissolve away, the bubbles can grow again to be in the active size range. The SL intensity at successive pulse on-time reﬂects the population of active bubbles. Thus, the decrease in the SL intensity during the pulse on-time as a function of pulse off-time gives a measure of the initial radius of active bubble. Lee et al. [31] obtained the experimental bubble radii of 2.8–3.7 μm for water and 0.9–1.7 μm for 1.5 mM SDS solution using the theory by Epstein and Plesset [32]. These values for water are smaller than the theoretical linear resonance size of 5.8 μm at 515 kHz. This is explained by the fact that nonlinear resonance size is smaller than the linear resonance size. Using a similar experimental technique, Brochie et al. [33] investigated the frequency and power dependencies of the size\n\nNumber of bubbles\n\nd\n\n15 10 5 0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Bubble dimaeter (µm)\n\n20\n\n20\n\n30 25\n\n0\n\nSDS(5mM)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\ne\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Bubble dimaeter (µm)\n\nSDS(10mM)\n\n0\n\n35\n\n0\n\n5\n\nBubble dimaeter (µm)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Bubble dimaeter (µm)\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n20\n\n30\n\n20\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\n\nSDS(0.1mM)\n\n35\n\n25\n\n30\n\nb\n\n25\n\n0\n\nDeionized Water\n\n35\n\n25\n\n30\n\na\n\n0\n\nc\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Bubble dimaeter (µm)\n\nSDS(1mM)\n\nFig. 8 Histogram of maximum diameter of cavitating bubbles under 87 kHz ultrasound with acoustic power of about 11 W.

Choi\n\ndistribution of SCL-emitting bubbles in a luminol solution. Figure 9 shows the results of the size distribution for several frequencies from 213 to 1136 kHz, indicating that the mean bubble size is smaller and the distribution becomes narrower with increasing frequency. It is noted that the bubble sizes in Fig. 9 are much smaller than those in Fig. 8 which shows the bubble sizes at their maxima. In Fig. 10, the active bubble size distributions are compared for SCL and SL at 575 kHz. The size is larger for SL bubbles than SCL bubbles. This indicates that there are two distinct classes of bubbles: larger bubbles which emit SL under a higher temperature condition at bubble collapse and smaller bubbles which produce OH radicals under a modest temperature condition at bubble collapse. In a pulsed ultrasound experiment, the enhancement of SL intensity or OH radical production may occur by an appropriate choice of pulse on-time and pulse off-time. Choi et al. [34] reported the enhancement of SL intensity and acoustic emission spectra at 103 kHz. As shown in Fig. 11, they obtained the maximum ampliﬁcation factor of 6.7 compared with continuous wave mode when the pulse on-cycle was 500 and pulse off-cycles were 500–10000. Lee et al. [35] and Tuziuti et al. [36] explained this enhancement by demonstrating the enlargement of SL and SCL spatial distributions with appropriate pulse-off times. The pulsed ultrasound may prevent the production of large degassing bubbles which absorb ultrasound energy, resulting in the increase in the active bubble population. Choi et al. [34] also reported the acoustic emission spectra, showing that subharmonic components and broadband\n\nFig. 9 The size distributions of SCL-emitting bubble at 213, 355, 647, 875, 1056, and 1136 kHz obtained using a pulsed ultrasound.

The acoustic pressure in the pulsed mode may be larger than that in the continuous mode because of the lack of large degassing bubbles which absorb sound energy. This increases the subharmonic components and broadband noise [37]. Another possibility is that nonspherical bubble oscillations are favored in the pulsed mode. A complex bubble oscillation emitting many daughter bubbles was observed by using a high-speed camera. Further experiments are required to understand the mechanism which elucidates the SL enhancement in a pulsed ultrasound ﬁeld. The observation of corresponding bubble dynamics will be helpful for that purpose.\n\nAcoustic Power Dependencies of Bubble Dynamics in Relation to Sonoluminescence Power Dependencies of Acoustic Cavitation Acoustic cavitation produces extreme temperature and pressure conditions inside bubbles at collapse. These conditions induce SL and promote chemical reactions. Factors affecting acoustic cavitation include the acoustic frequency, applied acoustic power, dissolved gas, solution temperature, and environmental pressure. The use of optimal factors is especially important when developing large-scale reactors for sonochemical applications. The optimal frequency for SL and sonochemical activity has been explored [38]. Beckett and Hua [39] investigated the SL spectra from water and the chemical reactivity (1,4-dioxane decomposition and hydrogen peroxide formation) at frequencies of 205, 358, 618, and 1071 kHz. They concluded that 358 kHz was the optimal frequency for obtaining maximum SL intensity and chemical reaction rates. Koda et al. [40] reported that approximately 300 kHz was the most efﬁcient frequency for the Fricke reaction and KI dosimetry on the basis of broadband measurements ranging from 19.5 to 1200 kHz. Kanthale et al. [41] showed that the SL intensity and hydrogen peroxide yield exhibited different frequency dependencies. This is because the SL intensity mainly depends on the maximum temperature within a bubble at collapse, whereas the hydrogen peroxide yield depends on the average temperature during bubble collapse as well as mass transfer effects. Yasui [42] numerically demonstrated that the mechanism of SL depends on the frequency. SL mainly originates from plasma emission at 1 MHz, whereas it originates from OH radical emission and plasma emission at 20 kHz. A suitable acoustic power is also an important factor for efﬁcient sonochemical reactions. The oxidation rate of iodide in aqueous KI solution has been shown to exhibit a nonlinear power dependence [43–46]. The oxidation of iodide has been used as a convenient method for evaluating the production of OH radicals. This method is called KI dosimetry. I ions are oxidized by OH radicals to give I2. When excess I ions are present in the solution, I2 reacts with the I ions to form I3 ions, which can be detected by their optical absorbance at 355 nm. Henglein and Gutierrez [45] demonstrated that the yield of iodine during KI oxidation showed a maximum when measured as a function of input power, as shown in Fig. 12. They used\n\nAcoustic Bubbles and Sonoluminescence\n\n15\n\n10\n\nrate l2 [10–5 M min–1]\n\n8 100 ms cont.\n\n6\n\n10 ms\n\n4 5 ms\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n140\n\nhf-power [watts] Fig. 12 Power dependence of the rate of iodine formation at 1 MHz.

The rate of iodine formation took a maximum at 60 W, which is equivalent to an acoustic power of 1.5 W/cm2, in the continuous mode. The dependence of the SL or SCL intensity on the acoustic power has only been investigated in a few intensive studies. Negishi [47] reported that the SCL intensity from a luminol solution suddenly decreased at an acoustic power of 2 W/cm2 at 470 kHz. Recently, Hatanaka et al. [48] observed that the SL intensity at 132 kHz decreases at high powers, which they did not specify. Kanthale et al. [34] investigated the acoustic power and frequency dependencies of the SL intensity and hydrogen peroxide yield and showed that both quantities increase with the acoustic power up to 30 W. An increase in acoustic power increases the active bubble population and the maximum active bubble size, both of which enhance the sonochemical activity if the interaction among active bubbles is weak. If the acoustic power is sufﬁciently strong for bubble-bubble interactions to dominate, the dependence will show nonlinear behavior.\n\nMeasurement Method for Acoustic Power When sound waves travel with velocity c through a liquid medium of density ρ, they transport the energy contained in them.
