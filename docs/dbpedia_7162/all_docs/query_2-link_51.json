        "text": "PeterDonis said:\n\nYou might want to reconsider that since very few prominent specialists in GR have been professional mathematicians. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Roger Penrose.\n\nAnd maybe Hermann Weyl. It's as usual: His math is brillant, also from a didactic point of view when referring to his very famous textbook \"Raum, Zeit, Materie\" (\"Space, Time, Matter\"). The mathematicians of his time, however seem to have thought not so positively about this book, because in Heisenberg's book \"Der Teil und das Ganze\" you can read about his experience with the famous mathematician Ferdinand Lindemann, whom he consulted concerning the choice of his subject of study at Munich university. When he told Lindemann that he has already read Weyl's book, Lindemann told him that he is already spoiled for a serious study of mathematics ;-)).\n\nWeyl's physics is not that brilliant, because the idea to gauge scale invariance of the matter-free gravitational field and taking the corresponding gauge field as the electromagnetic field was immediately considered wrong by Einstein and also Pauli, because indeed the measures of rods doesn't depend on their \"electromagnetic history\". In any case this idea of \"gauging of symmetries\" was ingenious in its own write. Weyl simply gauged the wrong symmetry in this case, and the entire thing gave the name associated with this idea till today: \"gauge theory\", \"gauging a symmetry\", etc.\n\nvanhees71 said:\n\nAnd maybe Hermann Weyl.\n\nYes, he's another example. I remember reading an English translation of \"Space, Time, Matter\" back when I was an undergraduate, and I couldn't make head or tail of it. Then, years later, after I had read through MTW and was more familiar with GR and tensors and so on, I suddenly realized what he was talking about.\n\nPeterDonis said:\n\nYes, he's another example.

I found it on Project Gutenberg. It is astonishing that this book is over 100 years old. Still, I want it.https://www.gutenberg.org/files/43006/43006-pdf.pdf\n\nPeterDonis said:\n\nYes, he's another example.

Then, years later, after I had read through MTW and was more familiar with GR and tensors and so on, I suddenly realized what he was talking about.\n\nI read the book also early in my undergraduate studies, and I found it pretty intuitive, at least the parts where he talks about the mathematical foundations. I had only trouble to understand the physics part. This I learned then from Landau and Lifshitz vol 2 :-).\n\nergospherical said:\n\nthis is probably one of the worst textbooks I've ever seen\n\nnot even trying to be edgy, it's just a complete mess and I don't know how anybody has learned anything from it\n\nCarroll, in his Lecture Notes on General Relativity, said abot MTW the following:\n\n\"A heavy book, in various senses. Most things you want to know are in here, although you might have to work hard to get to them (perhaps learning something unexpected in the process).\"\n\nergospherical said:\n\nthis is probably one of the worst textbooks I've ever seen\n\nnot even trying to be edgy, it's just a complete mess and I don't know how anybody has learned anything from it\n\nYou mean Landau Lifshitz vol 2? For me it's the most straightforward introduction to GR I've ever read. Of course you can critisize that it sticks to the Ricci calculus only, but that's good for the beginner. Without it, I'd not have had the chance to understand MTW when I learned the subject as a student. MTW is great, but you get too easily lost in all the details before you have an overview about GR from a more introductory level. Of course for the purpose to really get a deeper understanding also for more modern math (Cartan calculus) and more subtle discussions of the physics it's a gem.\n\nPeterDonis said:\n\nNo textbook will be suitable for everybody, but many, many people have learned a great deal from this one, so I think you might want to mute your criticism a bit.\n\nno doubt there's some really unique content, I just wish the explanations and the formatting weren't so convoluted and dragged-out so as to make much of it unreadable (to me at least)\n\nmaybe it'll be more useful later in my studies, but for now a terser book like Hawking and Ellis is proving much more enjoyable\n\nMTW has a special style, but I simply love it, because it's so different from nearly all other books on the topic. The same holds for Kip Thornes newest textbook, which I like even more:\n\nK. S. Thorne, R. D. Blanford, Classical Modern Physics, PUP (2017)\n\nIt contains really all \"classical physics\" (i.e., all non-quantum physics) treating it from a coherent conceptual point of view, emphasizing the geometric aspects of all physics. It treats the classical topics (mechanics, optics, stat. phys.) within both Newtonian and special+general relativistic physics in a really clear way. Maybe it's a bit sparse in showing every detail of all calculations, but emphasizes the general concepts. E.g., the explanation, why the phase-space distribution function in statistical physics is a relativistic scalar, makes this issue (which confuses even practitioners in the field sometimes) very clear.\n\nergospherical said:\n\nthis is probably one of the worst textbooks I've ever seen\n\nnot even trying to be edgy, it's just a complete mess and I don't know how anybody has learned anything from it\n\nbob012345 said:\n\nAre you referring to MTW?\n\nergospherical said:\n\ngravitation by charles misner, kip thorne and john wheeler\n\nI think that these students (from the 60s and 70s) were able to learn something from them...\n\n(from https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=31332 )\n\nPlesset, Milton Yale University 1932 29 Feynman, Richard Princeton University 1942 48 Wightman, Arthur Princeton University 1949 801 Tiomno, Jayme Princeton University 1950 5 Everett III, Hugh Princeton University 1957 Misner, Charles Princeton University 1957 58 Ernst, Frederick University of Wisconsin-Madison 1958 1 Brill, Dieter Princeton University 1959 34 Klauder, John Princeton University 1959 24 Shepley, Lawrence Princeton University 1965 2 Thorne, Kip Princeton University 1965 274 Geroch, Robert Princeton University 1967 30 Fischer, Arthur Princeton University 1969 Christodoulou, Demetrios Princeton University 1971 31 Unruh, William Princeton University 1971 5 Hu, Bei-Lok Princeton University 1972 38 Wald, Robert Princeton University 1972 5 Ford, Lawrence Princeton University 1974 10 Hojman, Sergio Princeton University 1975 2 Kheyfets, Arkady University of Texas at Austin 1986 1 Miller, Warner University of Texas at Austin 1986 1\n\nPossibly interesting:\n\nhttp://www.oobject.com/john-wheeler-and-his-elaborate-blackboard-presentations/"
