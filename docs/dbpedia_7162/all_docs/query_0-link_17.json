J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nA study examining impinging liquid jets has been underway to determine physical mechanisms responsible for combustion instabilities in liquid bi-propellant rocket engines. Primary atomization has been identified as an important process. Measurements of atomization length, wave structure, and drop size and velocity distribution were made under various ambient conditions. Test parameters included geometric effects and flow effects. It was observed that pre-impingement jet conditions, specifically whether they were laminar or turbulent, had the major effect on primary atomization. Comparison of the measurements with results from a two dimensional linear aerodynamic stability model of a thinning, viscous sheet were made. Measured turbulent impinging jet characteristics were contrary to model predictions; the structure of waves generated near the point of jet impingement were dependent primarily on jet diameter and independent of jet velocity. It has been postulated that these impact waves are related to pressure and momentum fluctuations near the impingement region and control the eventual disintegration of the liquid sheet into ligaments. Examination of the temporal characteristics of primary atomization (ligament shedding frequency) strongly suggests that the periodic nature of primary atomization is a key process in combustion instability.\n\nFormation of soap bubbles by gas jet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Maolei; Li, Min; Chen, Zhiyuan; Han, Jifeng; Liu, Dong\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSoap bubbles can be easily generated by various methods, while their formation process is complicated and still worth studying. A model about the bubble formation process was proposed in the study by Salkin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 077801 (2016)] recently, and it was reported that the bubbles were formed when the gas blowing velocity was above one threshold. However, after a detailed study of these experiments, we found that the bubbles could be generated in two velocity ranges which corresponded to the laminar and turbulent gas jet, respectively, and the predicted threshold was only effective for turbulent gas flow. The study revealed that the bubble formation was greatly influenced by the aerodynamics of the gas jet blowing to the film, and these results will help to further understand the formation mechanism of the soap bubble as well as the interaction between the gas jet and the thin liquid film.\n\nBATHYMETRIC IRREGULARITIES, JET FORMATION, AND SUBSEQUENT MIXING PROCESSES\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nIt is well known that bathymetric contours influence and steer currents and that irregularities in bathymetry contribute to the formation of aquatic non-buoyant jets and buoyant plumes. For example, bathymetric irregularities can channel flow through canyons or accelerate flow ov...\n\nSoot Formation in Hydrocarbon/Air Laminar Jet Diffusion Flames\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSunderland, P. B.; Faeth, G. M.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nSoot processes within hydrocarbon/air diffusion flames are important because they affect the durability and performance of propulsion systems, the hazards of unwanted fires, the pollutant and particulate emissions from combustion processes, and the potential for developing computational combustion. Motivated by these observations, this investigation involved an experimental study of the structure and soot properties of round laminar jet diffusion flames, seeking an improved understanding of soot formation (growth and nucleation) within diffusion flames. The present study extends earlier work in this laboratory concerning laminar smoke points (l) and soot formation in acetylene/air laminar jet diffusion flames (2), emphasizing soot formation in hydrocarbon/air laminar jet diffusion flames for fuels other than acetylene. In the flame system, acetylene is the dominant gas species in the soot formation region and both nucleation and growth were successfully attributed to first-order reactions of acetylene, with nucleation exhibiting an activation energy of 32 kcal/gmol while growth involved negligible activation energy and a collision efficiency of O.53%. In addition, soot growth in the acetylene diffusion flames was comparable to new soot in premixed flame (which also has been attributed to first-order acetylene reactions). In view of this status, a major issue is the nature of soot formation processes in diffusion flame involving hydrocarbon fuels other than acetylene. In particular, information is needed about th dominant gas species in the soot formation region and the impact of gas species other than acetylene on soot nucleation and growth.\n\nFormation mechanism of shock-induced particle jetting.\n\nPubMed\n\nXue, K; Sun, L; Bai, C\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe shock dissemination of granular rings or shells is characterized by the formation of coherent particle jets that have different dimensions from those associated with the constituent grains. In order to identify the mechanisms governing the formation of particle jets, we carry out the simulations of the shock dispersal of quasi-two-dimensional particle rings based on the discrete-element method. The evolution of the particle velocities and contact forces on the time scales ranging from microseconds to milliseconds reveals a two-stage development of particle jets before they are expelled from the outer surface. Much effort is made to understand the particle agglomeration around the inner surface that initiates the jet formation. The shock interaction with the innermost particle layers generates a heterogeneous network of force chains with clusters of strong contacts regularly spaced around the inner surface. Momentum alongside the stresses is primarily transmitted along the strong force chains. Therefore, the clustering of strong force chains renders the agglomeration of fast-moving particles connected by strong force chains. The fast-moving particle clusters subsequently evolve into the incipient particle jets. The following competition among the incipient jets that undergo unbalanced growth leads to substantial elimination of the minor jets and the significant multiplication of the major jets, the number of jets thus varying with time. Moreover, the number of jets is found to increase with the strength of the shock loading due to an increased number of jets surviving the retarding effect of major jets.\n\nGeneral Relativistic MHD Simulations of Jet Formation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMizuno, Y.; Nishikawa, K.-I.; Hardee, P.; Koide, S.; Fishman, G. J.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe have performed 3-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of jet formation from an accretion disk with/without initial perturbation around a rotating black hole. We input a sinusoidal perturbation (m = 5 mode) in the rotation velocity of the accretion disk. The simulation results show the formation of a relativistic jet from the accretion disk. Although the initial perturbation becomes weakened by the coupling among different modes, it survives and triggers lower modes. As a result, complex non-axisymmetric density structure develops in the disk and the jet. Newtonian MHD simulations of jet formation with a non-axisymmetric mode show the growth of the m = 2 mode but GRMHD simulations cannot see the clear growth of the m = 2 mode.\n\nNumerical simulation of particle jet formation induced by shock wave acceleration in a Hele-Shaw cell\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOsnes, A. N.; Vartdal, M.; Pettersson Reif, B. A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe formation of jets from a shock-accelerated cylindrical shell of particles, confined in a Hele-Shaw cell, is studied by means of numerical simulation. A number of simulations have been performed, systematically varying the coupling between the gas and solid phases in an effort to identify the primary mechanism(s) responsible for jet formation. We find that coupling through drag is sufficient for the formation of jets. Including the effect of particle volume fraction and particle collisions did not alter the general behaviour, but had some influence on the length, spacing and number of jets. Furthermore, we find that the jet selection process starts early in the dispersal process, during the initial expansion of the particle layer.\n\nJet formation of SF6 bubble induced by incident and reflected shock waves\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, Yuejin; Yu, Lei; Pan, Jianfeng; Pan, Zhenhua; Zhang, Penggang\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe computational results of two different cases on the evolution of the shock-SF6 heavy bubble interaction are presented. The shock focusing processes and jet formation mechanisms are analyzed by using the high resolution of computation schemes, and the influence of reflected shock waves is also investigated. It is concluded that there are two steps in the shock focusing process behind the incident shock wave, and the density and pressure values increase distinctly when the shock focusing process is completed. The local high pressure and vorticities in the vicinity of the downstream pole can propel the formation of the jet behind the incident shock wave. In addition, the gas is with the rightward velocity before the reflected shock wave impinges on the bubble; therefore, the evolutions of the waves and the bubble are more complicated when the reflected shock wave impinges on the SF6 bubble. Furthermore, the different end wall distances would affect the deformation degree of the bubble before the interaction of the reflected shock wave; therefore, the different left jet formation processes are found after the impingement of reflected shock waves when L = 27 mm. The local high pressure zones in the vicinity of the left bubble interface and the impingement of different shock waves can induce the local gas to shift the rightward velocity to the leftward velocity, which can further promote the formation of jets.\n\nDrop impact into a deep pool: vortex shedding and jet formation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAgbaglah, G.; Thoraval, M. -J.; Thoroddsen, S. T.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nOne of the simplest splashing scenarios results from the impact of a single drop on a deep pool. The traditional understanding of this process is that the impact generates an axisymmetric sheet-like jet that later breaks up into secondary droplets. Recently it was shown that even this simplest of scenarios is more complicated than expected because multiple jets can be generated from a single impact event and there are transitions in the multiplicity of jets as the experimental parameters are varied. Here, we use experiments and numerical simulations of a single drop impacting on a deep pool to examine themoreÂ Â» transition from impacts that produce a single jet to those that produce two jets. Using high-speed X-ray imaging methods we show that vortex separation within the drop leads to the formation of a second jet long after the formation of the ejecta sheet. Using numerical simulations we develop a phase diagram for this transition and show that the capillary number is the most appropriate order parameter for the transition.Â«Â less\n\nJet-induced star formation by accreting black holes: impact on stellar, galaxy, and cosmic evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMirabel, Igor Felix\n\n2016-07-01\n\nEvidence that relativistic jets trigger star formation along their axis has been found associated to low redshift and high redshift accreting supermassive black holes. However, the physical processes by which jet-cloud interaction may trigger star formation has so far not been elucidated. To gain insight into this potentially important star formation mechanism during reionization, when microquasars were form prolifically before AGN, our international team is carrying out a muliwavelength study of a microquasar jet-induced star formation region in the Milky Way using data from space missions (Chandra, Integral, ISO, Herschel) and from the ground (at cm and mm wavelengths with the VLA and IRAM, and IR with Gemini and VLT). I will show that this relative nearby star forming region is an ideal laboratory to test models of jet-induced star formation elsewhere in the universe.\n\nModeling Jet and Outflow Feedback during Star Cluster Formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFederrath, Christoph; SchrÃ¶n, Martin; Banerjee, Robi; Klessen, Ralf S.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nPowerful jets and outflows are launched from the protostellar disks around newborn stars. These outflows carry enough mass and momentum to transform the structure of their parent molecular cloud and to potentially control star formation itself. Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully quantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star cluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to resolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the same time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years. Current computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving this. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS) model for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and reproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of real jets, with ~1000 times lower resolution than would be required without the SGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster formation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about one-fourth of their parent molecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a parsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3) lead to the formation of ~1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow case. Most importantly, we find that jets and outflows reduce the average star mass by a factor of ~ three and may thus be essential for understanding the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function.\n\nAnalysis of the formation mechanism of the slug and jet center hole of axisymmetric shaped charges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaoxiang, Ren; Gang, Tao; Peng, Wen; Changxing, Du; Chunqiao, Pang; Hongbo, Meng\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn the jet formation process of axisymmetric shaped charges, the slug is also formed. There is always a central hole in the symmetry axis of the jet and slug. The phenomenon was rarely mentioned and analyzed by the classical theory of shaped charges. For this problem, this paper attempts to explain the existence of the central hole in the jet and slug. Based on the analysis of recovery slug, we know that the jet and slug are in solid state in the process of formation. Through the analysis of X-flash radiographs of the stretching jet and particulation fracture, it is confirmed that the center holes in the jet are also present. Meanwhile, through the analysis of the microstructure of the recovered slug, it is found that there is a wave disturbance near the surface of the central hole. It can be speculated that the wave disturbance also exist in the jet. This effect may be one of the reasons for jet breakup. Due to the presence of the central hole in the jet, the density deficit of the jet obtained by other tests is very reasonable.\n\nImpact of a single drop on the same liquid: formation, growth and disintegration of jets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAgbaglah, G. Gilou; Deegan, Robert\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOne of the simplest splashing scenarios results from the impact of a single drop on on the same liquid. The traditional understanding of this process is that the impact generates a jet that later breaks up into secondary droplets. Recently it was shown that even this simplest of scenarios is more complicated than expected because multiple jets can be generated from a single impact event and there are bifurcations in the multiplicity of jets. First, we study the formation, growth and disintegration of jets following the impact of a drop on a thin film of the same liquid using a combination of numerical simulations and linear stability theory. We obtain scaling relations from our simulations and use these as inputs to our stability analysis. We also use experiments and numerical simulations of a single drop impacting on a deep pool to examine the bifurcation from a single jet into two jets. Using high speed X-ray imaging methods we show that vortex separation within the drop leads to the formation of a second jet long after the formation of the ejecta sheet.\n\nFormation of Relativistic Jets : Magnetohydrodynamics and Synchrotron Radiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPorth, Oliver J. G.\n\n2011-11-01\n\nIn this thesis, the formation of relativistic jets is investigated by means of special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and synchrotron radiative transfer. Our results show that the magnetohydrodynamic jet self-collimation paradigm can also be applied to the relativistic case. In the first part, jets launched from rotating hot accretion disk coronae are explored, leading to well collimated, but only mildly relativistic flows. Beyond the light-cylinder, the electric charge separation force balances the classical trans-field Lorentz force almost entirely, resulting in a decreased efficiency of acceleration and collimation in comparison to non-relativistic disk winds. In the second part, we examine Poynting dominated flows of various electric current distributions. By following the outflow for over 3000 Schwarzschild radii, highly relativistic jets of Lorentz factor 8 and half-opening angles below 1 degree are obtained, providing dynamical models for the parsec scale jets of active galactic nuclei. Applying the magnetohydrodynamic structure of the quasi-stationary simulation models, we solve the relativistically beamed synchrotron radiation transport. This yields synthetic radiation maps and polarization patterns that can be used to confront high resolution radio and (sub-) mm observations of nearby active galactic nuclei. Relativistic motion together with the helical magnetic fields of the jet formation site imprint a clear signature on the observed polarization and Faraday rotation. In particular, asymmetries in the polarization direction across the jet can disclose the handedness of the magnetic helix and thus the spin direction of the central engine. Finally, we show first results from fully three-dimensional, high resolution adaptive mesh refinement simulations of jet formation from a rotating magnetosphere and examine the jet stability. Relativistic field-line rotation leads to an electric charge separation force that opposes the magnetic Lorentz\n\nSize limits the formation of liquid jets during bubble bursting\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Ji San; Weon, Byung Mook; Park, Su Ji; Je, Jung Ho; Fezzaa, Kamel; Lee, Wah-Keat\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA bubble reaching an airâliquid interface usually bursts and forms a liquid jet. Jetting is relevant to climate and health as it is a source of aerosol droplets from breaking waves. Jetting has been observed for large bubbles with radii of Râ«100âÎ¼m. However, few studies have been devoted to small bubbles (R<100âÎ¼m) despite the entrainment of a large number of such bubbles in sea water. Here we show that jet formation is inhibited by bubble size; a jet is not formed during bursting for bubbles smaller than a critical size. Using ultrafast X-ray and optical imaging methods, we build a phase diagram for jetting and the absence of jetting. Our results demonstrate that jetting in bubble bursting is analogous to pinching-off in liquid coalescence. The coalescence mechanism for bubble bursting may be useful in preventing jet formation in industry and improving climate models concerning aerosol production.

The aim of the present experimental work is to study particle dispersal with fingering effects in an original quasi-two-dimensional experiment facility in order to accurately extract information. Shock and blast waves are generated in the carrier gas at the center of a granular medium ring initially confined inside a Hele-Shaw cell and impulsively accelerated. With the present experimental setup, the particle jet formation is clearly observed. From fast flow visualizations, we notice, in all instances, that the jets are initially generated inside the particle ring and thereafter expelled outward. This point has not been observed in three-dimensional experiments. We highlight that the number of jets is unsteady and decreases with time. For a fixed configuration, considering the very early times following the initial acceleration, the jet size selection is independent of the particle diameter. Moreover, the influence of the initial overpressure and the material density on the particle jet formation have been studied. It is shown that the wave number of particle jets increases with the overpressure and with the decrease of the material density. The normalized number of jets as a function of the initial ring acceleration shows a power law valid for all studied configurations involving various initial pressure ratios, particle sizes, and particle materials.\n\nThe Role of Jet Adjustment Processes in Subtropical Dust Storms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPokharel, Ashok Kumar; Kaplan, Michael L.; Fiedler, Stephanie\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMeso-Î±/Î²/Î³ scale atmospheric processes of jet dynamics responsible for generating Harmattan, Saudi Arabian, and BodÃ©lÃ© Depression dust storms are analyzed with observations and high-resolution modeling. The analysis of the role of jet adjustment processes in each dust storm shows similarities as follows: (1) the presence of a well-organized baroclinic synoptic scale system, (2) cross mountain flows that produced a leeside inversion layer prior to the large-scale dust storm, (3) the presence of thermal wind imbalance in the exit region of the midtropospheric jet streak in the lee of the respective mountains shortly after the time of the inversion formation, (4) dust storm formation accompanied by large magnitude ageostrophic isallobaric low-level winds as part of the meso-Î² scale adjustment process, (5) substantial low-level turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), and (6) emission and uplift of mineral dust in the lee of nearby mountains. The thermally forced meso-Î³ scale adjustment processes, which occurred in the canyons/small valleys, may have been the cause of numerous observed dust streaks leading to the entry of the dust into the atmosphere due to the presence of significant vertical motion and TKE generation. This study points to the importance of meso-Î² to meso-Î³ scale adjustment processes at low atmospheric levels due to an imbalance within the exit region of an upper level jet streak for the formation of severe dust storms. The low level TKE, which is one of the prerequisites to deflate the dust from the surface, cannot be detected with the low resolution data sets; so our results show that a high spatial resolution is required for better representing TKE as a proxy for dust emission.\n\nJet Formation and Penetration Study of Double-Layer Shaped Charge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Zhe; Jiang, Jian-Wei; Wang, Shu-You; Liu, Han\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA theoretical analysis on detonation wave propagation in a double-layer shaped charge (DLSC) is performed. Numerical simulations using the AUTODYN software are carried out to compare the distinctions between jet formations in DLSC and ordinary shaped charge (OSC), in particular, the OSC made using a higher detonation velocity explosive, which is treated as the outer layer charge in the DLSC. The results show that the improved detonation velocity ratio and radial charge percentage of outer-to-inner layer charge are conducive to the formation of a convergent detonation wave, which contributes to enhancement of jet tip velocity in DLSC. The thickness and mass percentages of liner flowing into jet in DLSC closely follow the exponential distribution along the radial direction, but the percentages in DLSC and the mass of effective jet, which have significant influence on the penetration depth, are lower than those in OSC with the outer layer charge. This implies that the total charge energy is the major factor controlling the effective jet formation, which is confirmed by the verification tests using flash X-ray system and following penetration tests. The numerical simulation and test results compare well, while penetration test results indicate that the performance of DLSC is not better than that of OSC with the outer layer charge, due to the differences in jet formation.\n\nLaboratory formation of a scaled protostellar jet by coaligned poloidal magnetic field.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlbertazzi, B; Ciardi, A; Nakatsutsumi, M; Vinci, T; BÃ©ard, J; Bonito, R; Billette, J; Borghesi, M; Burkley, Z; Chen, S N; Cowan, T E; HerrmannsdÃ¶rfer, T; Higginson, D P; Kroll, F; Pikuz, S A; Naughton, K; Romagnani, L; Riconda, C; Revet, G; Riquier, R; Schlenvoigt, H-P; Skobelev, I Yu; Faenov, A Ya; Soloviev, A; Huarte-Espinosa, M; Frank, A; Portugall, O; PÃ©pin, H; Fuchs, J\n\n2014-10-17\n\nAlthough bipolar jets are seen emerging from a wide variety of astrophysical systems, the issue of their formation and morphology beyond their launching is still under study. Our scaled laboratory experiments, representative of young stellar object outflows, reveal that stable and narrow collimation of the entire flow can result from the presence of a poloidal magnetic field whose strength is consistent with observations. The laboratory plasma becomes focused with an interior cavity. This gives rise to a standing conical shock from which the jet emerges. Following simulations of the process at the full astrophysical scale, we conclude that it can also explain recently discovered x-ray emission features observed in low-density regions at the base of protostellar jets, such as the well-studied jet HH 154.

This is the basis of laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), a versatile printing technique that offers an alternative to inkjet printing. We study the influence of the fluid properties and laser pulse energy on jet formation using numerical simulations and time-resolved imaging. At low energies, surface tension causes the jet to retract without transferring a drop, and at high energies, the bubble breaks up into a splashing spray. We explore the parameter space of Weber number, Ohnesorge number, and ratio of film thickness to maximum bubble radius, revealing regions where uniform drops are transferred.\n\nJet-induced star formation in 3C 285 and Minkowski's Object\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalomÃ©, Q.; SalomÃ©, P.; Combes, F.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nHow efficiently star formation proceeds in galaxies is still an open question. Recent studies suggest that active galactic nucleus (AGN) can regulate the gas accretion and thus slow down star formation (negative feedback). However, evidence of AGN positive feedback has also been observed in a few radio galaxies (e.g. Centaurus A, Minkowski's Object, 3C 285, and the higher redshift 4C 41.17). Here we present CO observations of 3C 285 and Minkowski's Object, which are examples of jet-induced star formation. A spot (named 3C 285/09.6 in the present paper) aligned with the 3C 285 radio jet at a projected distance of ~70 kpc from the galaxy centre shows star formation that is detected in optical emission. Minkowski's Object is located along the jet of NGC 541 and also shows star formation. Knowing the distribution of molecular gas along the jets is a way to study the physical processes at play in the AGN interaction with the intergalactic medium. We observed CO lines in 3C 285, NGC 541, 3C 285/09.6, and Minkowski's Object with the IRAM 30 m telescope. In the central galaxies, the spectra present a double-horn profile, typical of a rotation pattern, from which we are able to estimate the molecular gas density profile of the galaxy. The molecular gas appears to be in a compact reservoir, which could be evidence of an early phase of the gas accretion after a recent merger event in 3C 285. No kinematic signature of a molecular outflow is detected by the 30 m telescope. Interestingly, 3C 285/09.6 and Minkowski's Object are not detected in CO. The cold gas mass upper limits are consistent with a star formation induced by the compression of dense ambient material by the jet. The depletion time scales in 3C 285/09.6 and Minkowski's Object are of the order of and even shorter than what is found in 3C 285, NGC 541, and local spiral galaxies (109 yr). The upper limit of the molecular gas surface density in 3C 285/09.6 at least follows a Schmidt-Kennicutt law if the emitting region\n\nSpray Formation from a Charged Liquid Jet of a Dielectric Fluid\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDoak, William; de Bellis, Victor; Chiarot, Paul; Microfluidics; Multiphase Flow Laboratory Team\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAtomization of a dielectric micro-jet is achieved via an electrohydrodynamic charge injection process. The atomizer is comprised of a grounded nozzle housing (ground electrode) and an internal probe (high voltage electrode) that is concentric with the emitting orifice. The internal probe is held at electric potentials ranging from 1-10 kV. A pressurized reservoir drives a dielectric fluid at a desired flow rate through the 100-micrometer diameter orifice. The fluid fills the cavity between the electrodes as it passes through the atomizer, impeding the transport of electrons. This process injects charge into the flowing fluid. Upon exiting the orifice, the emitted jet is highly charged and it deforms via a bending instability that is qualitatively similar to the behavior observed in the electrospinning of fibers. We observed bulging regions, or nodes, of highly charged fluid forming along the bent, rotating jet. These nodes separate into highly charged droplets that emit satellite droplets. The remaining ligaments break up due to capillarity in a process that produces additional satellites. All of the droplets possess a normal (inertial) and radial (electrically-driven) momentum component. The radial component is responsible for the formation of a conical spray envelope. Our research focuses on the jet, its break up, and the droplet dynamics of this system. This research supported by the American Chemical Society.\n\nConnections Between Jet Formation and Multiwavelength Spectral Evolution in Black Hole Transients\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKakemci, Emrah; Chun, Yoon-Young; Dincer, Tolga; Buxton, Michelle; Tomsick, John A.; Corbel, Stephane; Kaaret, Philip\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMultiwavelength observations are the key to understand conditions of jet formation in Galactic black hole transient (GBHT) systems. By studying radio and optical-infrared evolution of such systems during outburst decays, the compact jet formation can be traced. Comparing this with X-ray spectral and timing evolution we can obtain physical and geometrical conditions for jet formation, and study the contribution of jets to X-ray emission. In this work, first X-ray evolution - jet relation for XTE J1752-223 will be discussed. This source had very good coverage in X-rays, optical, infrared and radio. A long exposure with INTEGRAL also allowed us to study gamma-ray behavior after the jet turns on. We will also show results from the analysis of data from GX 339-4 in the hard state with SUZAKU at low flux levels. The fits to iron line fluorescence emission show that the inner disk radius increases by a factor of greater than 27 with respect to radii in bright states. This result, along with other disk radius measurements in the hard state will be discussed within the context of conditions for launching and sustaining jets.\n\nGas Cloud Accretion onto the SMBH SgrA* and Formation of Jet 4\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNishiyama, Shogo\n\n2015-06-01\n\nA dense gas cloud was detected to be rapidly approaching the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*, and was 1,600 Schwarzschild radii from the SMBH at the pericenter of its eccentric orbit in Mar 2014. Ongoing tidal disruption has been observed, and cloud fragments are expected to accrete onto the SMBH on dynamical timescales, suggesting a jet formation in the following years. So we are carrying out daily monitoring observations of Sgr A* in near-infrared and radio wavelengths, and we propose quick follow-up observations with Subaru/Gemini. Br-gamma line emission maps obtained with Gemini/NIFS will be used to fine tune our 3D simulation to estimate how much mass accretes, and when the fragments accrete onto the SMBH. Polarimetric and astrometric signals from a jet taken with Subaru/HiCIAO and KaVA will be compared with the finely tuned simulation to understand the timescale of jet formation, and to investigate the correlation between the accreted mass of the cloud fragments and a luminosity of the newly-formed jet. Spectroscopic and imaging observations from 1.6 - 11 mum (Subaru/IRCS, COMICS) will also be conducted to understand processes responsible for near to mid-infrared emission during the accretion event.\n\nI. Jet Formation and Evolution Due to 3D Magnetic Reconnection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-AvilÃ©s, J. J.; GuzmÃ¡n, F. S.; Fedun, V.; Verth, G.; Shelyag, S.; Regnier, S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nUsing simulated data-driven, 3D resistive MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere, we show that 3D magnetic reconnection may be responsible for the formation of jets with the characteristics of Type II spicules. We numerically model the photosphere-corona region using the C7 equilibrium atmosphere model. The initial magnetic configuration is a 3D potential magnetic field, extrapolated up to the solar corona region from a dynamic realistic simulation of the solar photospheric magnetoconvection model that mimics the quiet-Sun. In this case, we consider a uniform and constant value of the magnetic resistivity of 12.56 Î© m. We have found that the formation of the jet depends on the Lorentz force, which helps to accelerate the plasma upward. Analyzing various properties of the jet dynamics, we found that the jet structure shows a Doppler shift close to regions with high vorticity. The morphology, the upward velocity covering a range up to 130 km sâ1, and the timescale formation of the structure between 60 and 90 s, are similar to those expected for Type II spicules.\n\nThe mechanism of liquid metal jet formation in the cathode spot of vacuum arc discharge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGashkov, M. A.; Zubarev, N. M.; Mesyats, G. A.; Uimanov, I. V.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe have theoretically studied the dynamics of molten metal during crater formation in the cathode spot of vacuum arc discharge. At the initial stage, a liquid-metal ridge is formed around the crater. This process has been numerically simulated in the framework of the two-dimensional axisymmetric heat and mass transfer problem in the approximation of viscous incompressible liquid. At a more developed stage, the motion of liquid metal loses axial symmetry, which corresponds to a tendency toward jet formation. The development of azimuthal instabilities of the ridge is analyzed in terms of dispersion relations for surface waves. It is shown that maximum increments correspond to instability of the Rayleigh-Plateau type. Estimations of the time of formation of liquid metal jets and their probable number are obtained.\n\nSelforganized Structure Formation in Organized Microstructuring by Laser-Jet Etching\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRabbow, T. J.; Plath, P. J.; Mora, A.; Haase, M.\n\nLaser-jet induced wet etching of stainless steel in 5M H3PO4 has been investigated. By this method, it is possible to cut and microstructure metals and alloys that form passive layers in strong etchants. Due to the laser heating of the metal and the adjacent layers of the etchant, the passive layer is removed and an active dissolution of the base metal together with the formation of hydrogen is observed. The reactions are limited by the transport of fresh acid and the removal of dissolved metal. A jet of etchant reduces the transport limitations. For definite ranges of the laser power, the feed velocity and the etchant jet velocity, a regime of periodic structure formation of the kerf, often called ripples, has been found. The ripple length depends on all three parameters. The ripple formation can be brought into correlation with a periodic change of the intensity of the reflected light as well as oscillations of the potential workpiece. It could be shown that the periodic structure formation is connected to a spreading of an etching front from the laser activated area, that temporarily moves ahead to the laser. This leads to modulations of the interface for the laser absorption, which results, for example, in oscillations of the intensity of the reflected light. This means the laser induced etching reaction attracts a feedback based on the conditions of absorption for the laser. For those parameters of feed velocity, laser power and etchant jet velocity, without ripple formation the laser induced etching front is of a constant distance to the laser which results in steady conditions at the interface for the absorption of the laser.\n\nExperimental evidence of multimaterial jet formation with lasers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNicolaie, Ph.; Stenz, C.; Tikhonchuk, V.\n\n2010-11-15\n\nLaser-produced multimaterial jets have been investigated at the Prague Asterix Laser System laser [K. Jungwirth et al., Phys. Plasmas 8, 2495 (2001)]. The method of jet production is based on the laser-plasma ablation process and proved to be easy to set up and robust. The possibility of multimaterial laboratory jet production is demonstrated and complex hydrodynamic flows in the jet body are obtained. Two complementary diagnostics in the optical ray and x-ray ranges provide detailed information about jet characteristics. The latter are in agreement with estimates and two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulation results. The experiment provides a proof of principle thatmoreÂ Â» a velocity field could be produced and controlled in the jet body. It opens a possibility of astrophysical jet structure modeling in laboratory.Â«Â less\n\nSimulation of Plasma Jet Merger and Liner Formation within the PLX- Î± Project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSamulyak, Roman; Chen, Hsin-Chiang; Shih, Wen; Hsu, Scott\n\n2015-11-01\n\nDetailed numerical studies of the propagation and merger of high Mach number argon plasma jets and the formation of plasma liners have been performed using the newly developed method of Lagrangian particles (LP). The LP method significantly improves accuracy and mathematical rigor of common particle-based numerical methods such as smooth particle hydrodynamics while preserving their main advantages compared to grid-based methods. A brief overview of the LP method will be presented. The Lagrangian particle code implements main relevant physics models such as an equation of state for argon undergoing atomic physics transformation, radiation losses in thin optical limit, and heat conduction. Simulations of the merger of two plasma jets are compared with experimental data from past PLX experiments. Simulations quantify the effect of oblique shock waves, ionization, and radiation processes on the jet merger process. Results of preliminary simulations of future PLX- alpha experiments involving the ~ Ï / 2 -solid-angle plasma-liner configuration with 9 guns will also be presented.

In this work we study the effect that boundaries have on the granular jet formation. We did this by (i) decreasing the depth of the sand bed and (ii) reducing the container diameter to only a few ball diameters. These confinements change the behavior of the ball inside the bed, the void collapse, and the resulting jet height and shape. We map the parameter space of impact with Froude number, ambient pressure, and container dimensions as parameters. From these results we propose an explanation for the thick-thin structure of the jet reported by several groups ([J. R. Royer , Nat. Phys. 1, 164 (2005)], [G. Caballero , Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 018001 (2007)], and [J. O. Marston , Phys. Fluids 20, 023301 (2008)]).\n\nRadiative Processes in Jets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVila, Gabriela S.\n\nRelativistic jets and collimated outflows are ubiquitous phenomena in astrophysical settings, from young stellar objects up to Active Galactic Nuclei. The observed emission from some of these jets can cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. The relevant features of the spectral energy distributions depend on the nature of the source and on the characteristics of the surrounding environment. Here the author reviews the main physical processes that command the interactions between populations of relativistic particles locally accelerated in the jets, with matter, radiation and magnetic fields. Special attention is given to the conditions that lead to the dominance of the different radiative mechanisms. Examples from various types of sources are used to illustrate these effects.\n\nFormation of free round jets with long laminar regions at large Reynolds numbers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZayko, Julia; Teplovodskii, Sergey; Chicherina, Anastasia; Vedeneev, Vasily; Reshmin, Alexander\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe paper describes a new, simple method for the formation of free round jets with long laminar regions by a jet-forming device of Ë1.5 jet diameters in size. Submerged jets of 0.12 m diameter at Reynolds numbers of 2000-12 560 are experimentally studied. It is shown that for the optimal regime, the laminar region length reaches 5.5 diameters for Reynolds number Ë10 000 which is not achievable for other methods of laminar jet formation. To explain the existence of the optimal regime, a steady flow calculation in the forming unit and a stability analysis of outcoming jet velocity profiles are conducted. The shortening of the laminar regions, compared with the optimal regime, is explained by the higher incoming turbulence level for lower velocities and by the increase of perturbation growth rates for larger velocities. The initial laminar regions of free jets can be used for organising air curtains for the protection of objects in medicine and technologies by creating the air field with desired properties not mixed with ambient air. Free jets with long laminar regions can also be used for detailed studies of perturbation growth and transition to turbulence in round jets.\n\nThe Effect of Jetting Parameters on the Performance of Droplet Formation for Ink-Jet Rapid Prototyping\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHelmer, Wayne\n\n1998-01-01\n\nHeinzl et al. (1985) reports that experiments in ink-jets to produce drawings or signals occurred as early as 1930. Various companies such as IBM and Pitney-Bowes have conducted extensive studies on these devices for many years. Many such reports are available in such journals as the IBM Journal of Research and Development. While numerous articles have been published on the jetting characteristics of ink and water, the literature is rather limited on fluids such as waxes (Gao & Sonin 1994) or non-water based fluids (Passow, et al. 1993). This present study extends the knowledge base to determine the performance of molten waxes in \"ink-jet\" type printers for rapid prototyping. The purpose of this research was to qualitatively and quantitatively study the droplet formation of a drop-on-demand ink-jet type nozzle system for rapid prototyping.\n\nFormation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in magnetized protostellar jets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUstamujic, S.; Orlando, S.; Bonito, R.; Miceli, M.; GÃ³mez de Castro, A. I.; LÃ³pez-Santiago, J.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nContext. X-ray observations of protostellar jets show evidence of strong shocks heating the plasma up to temperatures of a few million degrees. In some cases, the shocked features appear to be stationary. They are interpreted as shock diamonds. Aims: We investigate the physics that guides the formation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in protostellar jets; the role of the magnetic field in determining the location, stability, and detectability in X-rays of these shocks; and the physical properties of the shocked plasma. Methods: We performed a set of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations that modelled supersonic jets ramming into a magnetized medium and explored different configurations of the magnetic field. The model takes into account the most relevant physical effects, namely thermal conduction and radiative losses. We compared the model results with observations, via the emission measure and the X-ray luminosity synthesized from the simulations. Results: Our model explains the formation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in a natural way. The magnetic field collimates the plasma at the base of the jet and forms a magnetic nozzle there. After an initial transient, the nozzle leads to the formation of a shock diamond at its exit which is stationary over the time covered by the simulations ( 40-60 yr; comparable with timescales of the observations). The shock generates a point-like X-ray source located close to the base of the jet with luminosity comparable with that inferred from X-ray observations of protostellar jets. For the range of parameters explored, the evolution of the post-shock plasma is dominated by the radiative cooling, whereas the thermal conduction slightly affects the structure of the shock.

GRPIC simulations, which allow charge separations in a collisionless plasma, do not need to invoke the frozen condition as in GRMHD simulations. 3-D GRPIC simulations show that jets are launched from Kerr black holes as in 3-D GRMHD simulations, but jet formation in the two cases may not be identical. Comparative study of black hole systems with GRPIC and GRMHD simulations with the inclusion of radiate transfer will further clarify the mechanisms that drive the evolution of disk-jet systems.\n\nAnalysis of Computational Models of Shaped Charges for Jet Formation and Penetration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaefner, Jonah; Ferguson, Jim\n\n2016-11-01\n\nShaped charges came into use during the Second World War demonstrating the immense penetration power of explosively formed projectiles and since has become a tool used by nearly every nation in the world. Penetration is critically dependent on how the metal liner is collapsed into a jet. The theory of jet formation has been studied in depth since the late 1940s, based on simple models that neglect the strength and compressibility of the metal liner. Although attempts have been made to improve these models, simplifying assumptions limit the understanding of how the material properties affect the jet formation. With a wide range of material and strength models available for simulation, a validation study was necessary to guide code users in choosing models for shaped charge simulations. Using PAGOSA, a finite-volume Eulerian hydrocode designed to model hypervelocity materials and strong shock waves developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, and experimental data, we investigated the effects of various equations of state and material strength models on jet formation and penetration of a steel target. Comparing PAGOSA simulations against modern experimental data, we analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of available computational models.

Our final goal is to understand the processes producing the relativistic outflows, as well as their relation with the inflow mechanisms. Initially, we analyze X-ray emission (RXTE PCA and HEXTE) from GRS 1915+105 during and after an X-ray/radio plateau epoch. The high signal-to-noise levels in our observations allow the first published measurement of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) RMS values using RXTE/HEXTE data. We find that the spectral energy distribution of the QPO strongly indicates an origin in the hard non-thermal emission component, suggesting a second spectral component to the hard non-thermal X-ray emission. Given the association of the QPOs with the observed jet activity in GRS 1915+105, we suggest that this additional non-thermal X-ray spectral component may be directly linked to the relativistic jet formation process. We also analyze simultaneous X-ray (RXTE/PCA) and near-IR (Palomar 200-inch) observations from the microquasar GRS 1915+105 during two similar low/hard state epochs and two different high X-ray variability epochs -- X-ray classes alpha and beta. The X-ray to IR cross-correlation function (CCF) shows that both low/hard state observations as well as the class beta observations present little or null interaction between the X-ray and IR fluxes, while the class alpha observations present a strong correlation between the X-ray (inner accretion disk) and the IR (compact jet) light curves. We also use the X-ray to IR CCF to study the relative evolution of the two signals and find no significant evolutionary track in any of the epochs. Simulated IR light curves confirm the results of the CCF, showing a flickering IR emission during the class beta high X-ray variability period that strengthens Ë10 s after every X-ray subflare. The existence of a flickering IR emission with frequencies in the range 0.1 to\n\nJet formation in cerium metal to examine material strength\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nJensen, B. J.; Cherne, F. J.; Prime, M. B.; ...\n\n2015-11-18\n\nExamining the evolution of material properties at extreme conditions advances our understanding of numerous high-pressure phenomena from natural events like meteorite impacts to general solid mechanics and fluid flow behavior. Some recent advances in synchrotron diagnostics coupled with dynamic compression platforms have introduced new possibilities for examining in-situ, spatially resolved material response with nanosecond time resolution. In this work, we examined jet formation from a Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in cerium initially shocked into a transient, high-pressure phase, and then released to a low-pressure, higher-temperature state. Cerium's rich phase diagram allows us to study the yield stress following a shock induced solid-solidmoreÂ Â» phase transition. X-ray imaging was used to obtain images of jet formation and evolution with 2â3 Î¼m spatial resolution. And from these images, an analytic method was used to estimate the post-shock yield stress, and these results were compared to continuum calculations that incorporated an experimentally validated equation-of-state (EOS) for cerium coupled with a deviatoric strength model. Reasonable agreement was observed between the calculations and the data illustrating the sensitivity of jet formation on the yield stress values. Finally, the data and analysis shown here provide insight into material strength during dynamic loading which is expected to aid in the development of strength aware multi-phase EOS required to predict the response of matter at extreme conditions.Â«Â less\n\nSTAR FORMATION SUPPRESSION DUE TO JET FEEDBACK IN RADIO GALAXIES WITH SHOCKED WARM MOLECULAR GAS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLanz, Lauranne; Ogle, Patrick M.; Appleton, Philip N.\n\n2016-07-20\n\nWe present Herschel observations of 22 radio galaxies, selected for the presence of shocked, warm molecular hydrogen emission. We measured and modeled spectral energy distributions in 33 bands from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared to investigate the impact of jet feedback on star formation activity. These galaxies are massive, early-type galaxies with normal gas-to-dust ratios, covering a range of optical and infrared colors. We find that the star formation rate (SFR) is suppressed by a factor of â¼3â6, depending on how molecular gas mass is estimated. We suggest that this suppression is due to the shocks driven by the radiomoreÂ Â» jets injecting turbulence into the interstellar medium (ISM), which also powers the luminous warm H{sub 2} line emission. Approximately 25% of the sample shows suppression by more than a factor of 10. However, the degree of SFR suppression does not correlate with indicators of jet feedback including jet power, diffuse X-ray emission, or intensity of warm molecular H{sub 2} emission, suggesting that while injected turbulence likely impacts star formation, the process is not purely parameterized by the amount of mechanical energy dissipated into the ISM. Radio galaxies with shocked warm molecular gas cover a wide range in SFRâstellar mass space, indicating that these galaxies are in a variety of evolutionary states, from actively star-forming and gas-rich to quiescent and gas-poor. SFR suppression appears to have the largest impact on the evolution of galaxies that are moderately gas-rich.Â«Â less\n\nFormation of liquid-metal jets in a vacuum arc cathode spot: Analogy with drop impact on a solid surface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGashkov, M. A.; Zubarev, N. M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nConditions of the liquid-metal jets formation in a cathode spot of a vacuum arc discharge are studied. Our consideration is based on the analogy between the processes, occurring in the liquid phase of the cathode spot, and the processes, accompanying a liquid drop impact on a flat solid surface. In the latter case there exists a wide variety of experimental data on the conditions under which the spreading regime of fluid motion (i.e., without formation of jets and secondary droplets) changes into the splashing one. In the present work, using the hydrodynamic similarity principle (processes in geometrically similar systems will proceed similarly when their Weber and Reynolds numbers coincide), criteria for molten metal splashing are formulated for different materials of the cathode. They are compared with the experimental data on the threshold conditions for vacuum arc burning.\n\nFormation and Destruction of Jets in X-ray Binaries\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKylafix, N. D.; Contopoulos, I.; Kazanas, D.; Christodoulou, D. M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nContext. Neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries (XRBs) exhibit radio jets, whose properties depend on the X-ray spectral state e.nd history of the source. In particular, black-hole XRBs emit compact, 8teady radio jets when they are in the so-called hard state. These jets become eruptive as the sources move toward the soft state, disappear in the soft state, and then re-appear when the sources return to the hard state. The jets from neutron-star X-ray binaries are typically weaker radio emitters than the black-hole ones at the same X-ray luminosity and in some cases radio emission is detected in the soft state. Aims. Significant phenomenology has been developed to describe the spectral states of neutron-star and black-hole XRBs, and there is general agreement about the type of the accretion disk around the compact object in the various spectral states. We investigate whether the phenomenology describing the X-ray emission on one hand and the jet appearance and disappearance on the other can be put together in a consistent physical picture. Methods. We consider the so-called Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), which has been shown to explain in a natural way the formation of magnetic fields in the disks of AGNs and the ejection of jets. We investigate whether the PRCB can also explain the [ormation, destruction, and variability or jets in XRBs. Results. We find excellent agreement between the conditions under which the PRCB is efficient (i.e., the type of the accretion disk) and the emission or destruction of the r.adio jet. Conclusions. The disk-jet connection in XRBs can be explained in a natural way using the PRCB.\n\nFilament Channel Formation, Eruption, and Jet Generation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeVore, C. Richard; Antiochos, Spiro K.; Karpen, Judith T.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe mechanism behind filament-channel formation is a longstanding mystery, while that underlying the initiation of coronal mass ejections and jets has been studied intensively but is not yet firmly established. In previous work, we and collaborators have investigated separately the consequences of magnetic-helicity condensation (Antiochos 2013) for forming filament channels (Zhao et al. 2015; Knizhnik et al. 2015, 2017a,b) and of the embedded-bipole model (Antiochos 1996) for generating reconnection-driven jets (Pariat et al. 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016; Wyper et al. 2016, 2017). Now we have taken a first step toward synthesizing these two lines of investigation. Our recent study (Karpen et al. 2017) of coronal-hole jets with gravity and wind employed an ad hoc, large-scale shear flow at the surface to introduce magnetic free energy and form the filament channel. In this effort, we replace the shear flow with an ensemble of local rotation cells, to emulate the Sunâs ever-changing granules and supergranules. As in our previous studies, we find that reconnection between twisted flux tubes within the closed-field region concentrates magnetic shear and free energy near the polarity inversion line, forming the filament channel. Onset of reconnection between this field and the external, unsheared, open field releases stored energy to drive the impulsive jet. We discuss the results of our new simulations with implications for understanding solar activity and space weather.\n\nFormation of a rotating jet during the filament eruption on 2013 April 10-11\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFilippov, B.; Srivastava, A. K.; Dwivedi, B. N.; Masson, S.; Aulanier, G.; Joshi, N. C.; Uddin, W.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nWe analyse multiwavelength and multiviewpoint observations of a helically twisted plasma jet formed during a confined filament eruption on 2013 April 10-11. Given a rather large-scale event with its high spatial and temporal resolution observations, it allows us to clearly understand some new physical details about the formation and triggering mechanism of twisting jet. We identify a pre-existing flux rope associated with a sinistral filament, which was observed several days before the event. The confined eruption of the filament within a null-point topology, also known as an Eiffel tower (or inverted-Y) magnetic field configuration results in the formation of a twisted jet after the magnetic reconnection near a null point. The sign of helicity in the jet is found to be the same as that of the sign of helicity in the filament. Untwisting motion of the reconnected magnetic field lines gives rise to the accelerating plasma along the jet axis. The event clearly shows the twist injection from the pre-eruptive magnetic field to the jet.\n\nVLBA Reveals Formation Region of Giant Cosmic Jet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n1999-10-01\n\nAstronomers have gained their first glimpse of the mysterious region near a black hole at the heart of a distant galaxy, where a powerful stream of subatomic particles spewing outward at nearly the speed of light is formed into a beam, or jet, that then goes nearly straight for thousands of light-years. The astronomers used radio telescopes in Europe and the U.S., including the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to make the most detailed images ever of the center of the galaxy M87, some 50 million light-years away. \"This is the first time anyone has seen the region in which a cosmic jet is formed into a narrow beam,\" said Bill Junor of the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque. \"We had always speculated that the jet had to be made by some mechanism relatively near the black hole, but as we looked closer and closer to the center, we kept seeing an already-formed beam. That was becoming embarrassing, because we were running out of places to put the formation mechanism that we knew had to be there.\" Junor, along with John Biretta and Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute, in Baltimore, MD, now have shown that M87's jet is formed within a few tenths of a light-year of the galaxy's core, presumed to be a black hole three billion times more massive than the sun. In the formation region, the jet is seen opening widely, at an angle of about 60 degrees, nearest the black hole, but is squeezed down to only 6 degrees a few light-years away. \"The 60-degree angle of the inner part of M87's jet is the widest such angle yet seen in any jet in the universe,\" said Junor. \"We found this by being able to see the jet to within a few hundredths of a light-year of the galaxy's core -- an unprecedented level of detail.\" The scientists reported their findings in the October 28 issue of the journal Nature. At the center of M87, material being drawn inward by the strong gravitation of the black hole is formed into a rapidly-spinning flat\n\nControlled formation of cyclopentane hydrate suspensions via capillary-driven jet break-up\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeri, Michela; McKinley, Gareth\n\n2017-11-01\n\nClathrate hydrates are crystalline compounds that form when a lattice of hydrogen-bonded water molecules is filled by guest molecules sequestered from an adjacent gas or liquid phase. Being able to rapidly produce and transport synthetic hydrates is of great interest given their significant potential as a clean energy source and safe option for hydrogen storage. We propose a new method to rapidly produce cyclopentane hydrate suspensions at ambient pressure with tunable particle size distribution by taking advantage of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability to form a mono-disperse stream of droplets during the controlled break-up of a water jet. The droplets are immediately frozen into ice particles through immersion in a subcooled reservoir and converted into hydrates with a dramatic reduction in the nucleation induction time. By measuring the evolution of the rheological properties with time, we monitor the process of hydrates formation via surface crystallization and agglomeration with different droplet size distributions. This new method enables us to gain new insights into hydrate formation and transport which was previously hindered by uncontrolled droplet formation and hydrate nucleation processes.

K.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA combustion jet ignition system was developed to generate turbulent jets of combustion products containing free radicals and to discharge them as ignition sources into a combustible medium. In order to understand the ignition and the inflammation processes caused by combustion jets, the studies of the fluid mechanical properties of turbulent jets with and without combustion were conducted theoretically and experimentally. Experiments using a specially designed igniter, with a prechamber to build up and control the stagnation pressure upstream of the orifice, were conducted to investigate the formation processes of turbulent jets of combustion products. The penetration speed of combustion jets has been found to be constant initially and then decreases monotonically as turbulent jets of combustion products travel closer to the wall. This initial penetration speed to combustion jets is proportional to the initial stagnation pressure upstream of the orifice for the same stoichiometric mixture. Computer simulations by Chorin's Random Vortex Method implemented with the flame propagation algorithm for the theoretical model of turbulent jets with and without combustion were performed to study the turbulent jet flow field. In the formation processes of the turbulent jets, the large-scale eddy structure of turbulence, the so-called coherent structure, dominates the entrainment and mixing processes. The large-scale eddy structure of turbulent jets in this study is constructed by a series of vortex pairs, which are organized in the form of a staggered array of vortex clouds generating local recirculation flow patterns.\n\nBlob Formation and Ejection in Coronal Jets due to the Plasmoid and KelvinâHelmholtz Instabilities\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNi, Lei; Lin, Jun; Zhang, Qing-Min\n\n2017-05-20\n\nWe perform 2D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of coronal jets driven by flux emergence along the lower boundary. The reconnection layers are susceptible to the formation of blobs that are ejected in the jet. Our simulation with low plasma Î² (Case I) shows that magnetic islands form easily and propagate upward in the jet. These islands are multithermal and thus are predicted to show up in hot channels (335 â« and 211 â«) and the cool channel (304 â«) in observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory . The islands have maximum temperatures of 8 MK,moreÂ Â» lifetimes of 120 s, diameters of 6 Mm, and velocities of 200 km s{sup â1}. These parameters are similar to the properties of blobs observed in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets by AIA. The KelvinâHelmholtz instability develops in our simulation with moderately high plasma Î² (Case II) and leads to the formation of bright vortex-like blobs above the multiple high magnetosonic Mach number regions that appear along the jet. These vortex-like blobs can also be identified in the AIA channels. However, they eventually move downward and disappear after the high magnetosonic Mach number regions disappear. In the lower plasma Î² case, the lifetime for the jet is shorter, the jet and magnetic islands are formed with higher velocities and temperatures, the current-sheet fragments are more chaotic, and more magnetic islands are generated. Our results show that the plasmoid instability and KelvinâHelmholtz instability along the jet are both possible causes of the formation of blobs observed at EUV wavelengths.Â«Â less\n\nFlux rope breaking and formation of a rotating blowout jet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoshi, Navin Chandra; Nishizuka, Naoto; Filippov, Boris; Magara, Tetsuya; Tlatov, Andrey G.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe analysed a small flux rope eruption converted into a helical blowout jet in a fan-spine configuration using multiwavelength observations taken by Solar Dynamics Observatory, which occurred near the limb on 2016 January 9. In our study, first, we estimated the fan-spine magnetic configuration with the potential-field calculation and found a sinistral small filament inside it. The filament along with the flux rope erupted upwards and interacted with the surrounding fan-spine magnetic configuration, where the flux rope breaks in the middle section. We observed compact brightening, flare ribbons, and post-flare loops underneath the erupting filament. The northern section of the flux rope reconnected with the surrounding positive polarity, while the southern section straightened. Next, we observed the untwisting motion of the southern leg, which was transformed into a rotating helical blowout jet. The sign of the helicity of the mini-filament matches the one of the rotating jets. This is consistent with recent jet models presented by Adams et al. and Sterling et al. We focused on the fine thread structure of the rotating jet and traced three blobs with the speed of 60-120 km s- 1, while the radial speed of the jet is Ë400 km s- 1. The untwisting motion of the jet accelerated plasma upwards along the collimated outer spine field lines, and it finally evolved into a narrow coronal mass ejection at the height of Ë9Rsun. On the basis of detailed analysis, we discussed clear evidence of the scenario of the breaking of the flux rope and the formation of the helical blowout jet in the fan-spine magnetic configuration.\n\nLiquid phase products and solid deposit formation from thermally stressed model jet fuels\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKim, W. S.; Bittker, D. A.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe relationship between solid deposit formation and liquid degradation product concentration was studied for the high temperature (400 C) stressing of three hydrocarbon model fuels. A Jet Fuel Thermal Oxidation Tester was used to simulate actual engine fuel system conditions. The effects of fuel type, dissolved oxygen concentration, and hot surface contact time (reaction time) were studied. Effects of reaction time and removal of dissolved oxygen on deposit formation were found to be different for n-dodecane and for 2-ethylnaphthalene. When ten percent tetralin is added to n-dodecane to give a simpler model of an actual jet fuel, the tetralin inhibits both the deposit formation and the degradation of n-dodecane. For 2-ethylnaphthalene primary product analyses indicate a possible self-inhibition at long reaction times of the secondary reactions which form the deposit precursors. The mechanism of the primary breakdown of these fuels is suggested and the primary products which participate in these precursor-forming reactions are identified. Some implications of the results to the thermal degradation of real jet fuels are given.\n\nGood News from Big Bad Black Holes: Jet-Induced Star Formation in ``Minkowski's Object\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Breugel, W.; Croft, S.; de Vries, W.; van Gorkom, J. H.; Morganti, R.; Osterloo, T.; Dopita, M.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWe present VLA neutral hydrogen (HI) observations which show that ``Minkowski's Object\", a peculiar starburst system, is due to the interaction of a low luminosity (FR-I type) radio jet with the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cluster of galaxies A194. The transverse size and bimodal structure of the HI cloud, straddling the jet; its location downstream from the star forming region; and kinematic evidence for gas entrainment all are in agreement with previous numerical simulations (Fragile et al 2004) which concluded that FR-I type jets can trigger star formation by driving radiative shocks into the moderately dense, warm gas that is typical of central galaxy cluster regions. We compare the timescales for HI formation with the age of the starburst derived from recent Keck, Lick and HST spectroscopic and imaging data (see poster by Croft et al), which allows us to put constraints on the physical conditions in the radio jet (speed) and its ambient medium (density).\n\nEvolution of Fine-scale Penumbral Magnetic Structure and Formation of Penumbral Jets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTiwari, S. K.; Moore, R. L.; Rempel, M.; Winebarger, A. R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSunspot penumbra consists of spines (more vertical field) and penumbral filaments (interspines). Spines are outward extension of umbra. Penumbral filaments are recently found, both in observations and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, to be magnetized stretched granule-like convective cells, with strong upflows near the head that continues along the central axis with weakening strength of the flow. Strong downflows are found at the tails of filaments and weak downflows along the sides of it. These lateral downflows often contain opposite polarity magnetic field to that of spines; most strongly near the heads of filaments. In spite of this advancement in understanding of small-scale structure of sunspot penumbra, how the filaments and spines evolve and interact remains uncertain. Penumbral jets, bright, transient features, seen in the chromosphere, are one of several dynamic events in sunspot penumbra. It has been proposed that these penumbral microjets result from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and could contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it was proposed that the jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it was found that these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots. We discuss how the proposed formation of penumbral jets is integral to the formation mechanism of penumbral filaments and spines, and may explain why penumbral jets are few and far between. We also point out that the generation of the penumbral jets could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field.\n\nConstraints on Jet Formation Mechanisms with the Most Energetic Giant Outbursts in MS 0735+7421\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Shuang-Liang; Cao, Xinwu\n\n2012-07-01\n\nGiant X-ray cavities lie in some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) locating in central galaxies of clusters, which are estimated to have stored 1055-1062 erg of energy. Most of these cavities are thought to be inflated by jets of AGNs on a timescale of >~ 107 years. The jets can be either powered by rotating black holes or the accretion disks surrounding black holes, or both. The observations of giant X-ray cavities can therefore be used to constrain jet formation mechanisms. In this work, we choose the most energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~1062 erg, to constrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive black hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity is ~10-5 L Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the cavity is estimated as ~0.02L Edd, which implies that the source has previously experienced strong outbursts. During outbursts, the jet power and the mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values. We construct an accretion disk model in which the angular momentum and energy carried away by jets are properly included to calculate the spin and mass evolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet formation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~1062 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with a combination of the Blandford-Payne and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant cavity if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total (radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk. For a dynamo-generated magnetic field in the disk, such an energetic giant cavity can be inflated by the magnetically driven jets only if the initial black hole spin parameter a 0 >~ 0.95. Our calculations show that the final spin parameter a of the black hole is always ~0.9-0.998 for all the computational\n\nExplaining formation of Astronomical Jets using Dynamic Universe Model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNaga Parameswara Gupta, Satyavarapu\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAstronomical jets are observed from the centres of many Galaxies including our own Milkyway. The formation of such jet is explained using SITA simulations of Dynamic Universe Model. For this purpose the path traced by a test neutron is calculated and depicted using a set up of one densemass of the mass equivalent to mass of Galaxy center, 90 stars with similar masses of stars near Galaxy center, mass equivalents of 23 Globular Cluster groups, 16 Milkyway parts, Andromeda and Triangulum Galaxies at appropriate distances. Five different kinds of theoretical simulations gave positive results The path travelled by this test neutron was found to be an astronomical jet emerging from Galaxy center. This is another result from Dynamic Universe Model. It solves new problems like a. Variable Mass Rocket Trajectory Problem b. Explaining Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations c. Astronomical jets observed from Milkyway Center d. Prediction of Blue shifted Galaxies e. Explaining Pioneer Anomaly f. Prediction of New Horizons satellite trajectory etc. Dynamic Universe Model never reduces to General relativity on any condition. It uses a different type of mathematics based on Newtonian physics. This mathematics used here is simple and straightforward. As there are no differential equations present in Dynamic Universe Model, the set of equations give single solution in x y z Cartesian coordinates for every point mass for every time step\n\nDevelopment of a water-jet assisted laser paint removal process\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMadhukar, Yuvraj K.; Mullick, Suvradip; Nath, Ashish K.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe laser paint removal process usually leaves behind traces of combustion product i.e. ashes on the surface. An additional post-processing such as light-brushing or wiping by some mechanical means is required to remove the residual ash. In order to strip out the paint completely from the surface in a single step, a water-jet assisted laser paint removal process has been investigated. The 1.07 Î¼m wavelength of Yb-fiber laser radiation has low absorption in water; therefore a high power fiber laser was used in the experiment. The laser beam was delivered on the paint-surface along with a water jet to remove the paint and residual ashes effectively. The specific energy, defined as the laser energy required removing a unit volume of paint was found to be marginally more than that for the gas-jet assisted laser paint removal process. However, complete paint removal was achieved with the water-jet assist only. The relatively higher specific energy in case of water-jet assist is mainly due to the scattering of laser beam in the turbulent flow of water-jet.\n\nExperimental Characterization of the Jet Wiping Process\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMendez, Miguel Alfonso; Enache, Adriana; Gosset, Anne; Buchlin, Jean-Marie\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis paper presents an experimental characterization of the jet wiping process, used in continuous coating applications to control the thickness of a liquid coat using an impinging gas jet. Time Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV) is used to characterize the impinging gas flow, while an automatic interface detection algorithm is developed to track the liquid interface at the impact. The study of the flow interaction is combined with time resolved 3D thickness measurements of the liquid film remaining after the wiping, via Time Resolved Light Absorption (TR-LAbs). The simultaneous frequency analysis of liquid and gas flows allows to correlate their respective instability, provide an experimental data set for the validation of numerical studies and allows for formulating a working hypothesis on the origin of the coat non-uniformity encountered in many jet wiping processes.\n\nPhotoexcitation cascade and quantum-relativistic jet formation in graphene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLewandowski, Cyprian; Levitov, Leonid\n\nInteractions between ultra-relativistic particles can lead to striking behavior in which a high-energy particle creates showers of softer particles characterized by a collimated angular distribution aligned with the particle velocity. These showers, known as jets, are a generic phenomenon relevant for all quantum cascades of linearly dispersing particles. This talk will discuss jets formed upon photoexcitation in graphene, which due to its linear dispersion provides an appealing medium for exploring quantum-relativistic phenomena. We will study the cascade generated by carrier-carrier collisions in photon absorption, wherein a single photon creates an electron-hole (e-h) excitation that decays producing multiple near-collinear secondary e-h excitations. We will argue that the cascade can occur through an off-shell mechanism such that all the particles and holes involved reside outside the energy-momentum dispersion manifold, relieving the bottleneck arising in the on-shell process due to energy and momentum conservation. The characteristics of the jets such as the angular and energy distribution of the particles will be discussed. Photogenerated jets provide an interesting setting to investigate the carrier-carrier collision processes in graphene and other Dirac materials. We acknowledge support of the Center for Integrated Quantum Materials (CIQM) under NSF award DMR-1231319.\n\nExperimental evidence for collisional shock formation via two obliquely merging supersonic plasma jets\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMerritt, Elizabeth C., E-mail: emerritt@lanl.gov; Adams, Colin S.; University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131\n\nWe report spatially resolved measurements of the oblique merging of two supersonic laboratory plasma jets. The jets are formed and launched by pulsed-power-driven railguns using injected argon, and have electron density â¼10{sup 14}âcm{sup â3}, electron temperature â1.4âeV, ionization fraction near unity, and velocity â40âkm/s just prior to merging. The jet merging produces a few-cm-thick stagnation layer, as observed in both fast-framing camera images and multi-chord interferometer data, consistent with collisional shock formation [E. C.

Lett. 111, 085003 (2013)].\n\nFormation and crystallisation of a liquid jet in a film exposed to a tightly focused laser beam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnisimov, S. I.; Zhakhovsky, V. V.; Inogamov, N. A.; Murzov, S. A.; Khokhlov, V. A.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis paper considers the effect of an ultrashort laser pulse on a thin gold film on a glass substrate at a focal spot size near 1 Î¼m. We analyse the motion and thermal history of a film that has peeled off from the substrate in the heating spot as a consequence of melting. The detached zone is shown to form a domeshaped bump whose motion is hindered by surface tension. After the dome stops and turns back, towards the substrate, a jet begins to grow on its top. Concurrently, because of the heat dissipation in the film, melt recrystallisation begins, involving first the dome and then the jet. The liquid part of the jet elongates and breaks up into droplets because of the Plateau-Rayleigh instability development. The formation of a neck and the detachment of the last droplet occur in the solidification zone between the crystalline and liquid parts of the jet. The propagation of the crystallisation zone in the jet leads the necking process, so neck disruption occurs in the solid phase under nonequilibrium crystallisation conditions (the melt temperature is hundreds of kelvins lower than the melting point), at limiting mechanical stress and at high deformation rates. As a result, the jet transforms into a high needle with an extremely small tip radius (a few nanometres).\n\nProcess Development of Porcelain Ceramic Material with Binder Jetting Process for Dental Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiyanaji, Hadi; Zhang, Shanshan; Lassell, Austin; Zandinejad, Amirali; Yang, Li\n\n2016-03-01\n\nCustom ceramic structures possess significant potentials in many applications such as dentistry and aerospace where extreme environments are present. Specifically, highly customized geometries with adequate performance are needed for various dental prostheses applications. This paper demonstrates the development of process and post-process parameters for a dental porcelain ceramic material using binder jetting additive manufacturing (AM). Various process parameters such as binder amount, drying power level, drying time and powder spread speed were studied experimentally for their effect on geometrical and mechanical characteristics of green parts. In addition, the effects of sintering and printing parameters on the qualities of the densified ceramic structures were also investigated experimentally. The results provide insights into the process-property relationships for the binder jetting AM process, and some of the challenges of the process that need to be further characterized for the successful adoption of the binder jetting technology in high quality ceramic fabrications are discussed.\n\nFormation of Bipolar Lobes by Jets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSoker, Noam\n\n2002-04-01\n\nI conduct an analytical study of the interaction of jets, or a collimated fast wind (CFW), with a previously blown asymptotic giant branch (AGB) slow wind. Such jets (or CFWs) are supposedly formed when a compact companion, a main-sequence star, or a white dwarf accretes mass from the AGB star, forms an accretion disk, and blows two jets. This type of flow, which I think shapes bipolar planetary nebulae (PNs), requires three-dimensional gasdynamical simulations, which are limited in the parameter space they can cover. By imposing several simplifying assumptions, I derive simple expressions which reproduce some basic properties of lobes in bipolar PNs and which can be used to guide future numerical simulations. I quantitatively apply the results to two proto-PNs. I show that the jet interaction with the slow wind can form lobes which are narrow close to, and far away from, the central binary system, and which are wider somewhere in between. Jets that are recollimated and have constant cross section can form cylindrical lobes with constant diameter, as observed in several bipolar PNs. Close to their source, jets blown by main-sequence companions are radiative; only further out they become adiabatic, i.e., they form high-temperature, low-density bubbles that inflate the lobes.\n\nObservations of breakup processes of liquid jets using real-time X-ray radiography\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChar, J. M.; Kuo, K. K.; Hsieh, K. C.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nTo unravel the liquid-jet breakup process in the nondilute region, a newly developed system of real-time X-ray radiography, an advanced digital image processor, and a high-speed video camera were used. Based upon recorded X-ray images, the inner structure of a liquid jet during breakup was observed. The jet divergence angle, jet breakup length, and fraction distributions along the axial and transverse directions of the liquid jets were determined in the near-injector region. Both wall- and free-jet tests were conducted to study the effect of wall friction on the jet breakup process.\n\nDrug recrystallization using supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) process with impinging jets: Effect of process parameters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCareno, StÃ©phanie; Boutin, Olivier; Badens, Elisabeth\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to improve mixing in supercritical anti-solvent process (SAS) with impinging jets in order to form finer particles of sulfathiazole, a poorly water-soluble drug. The influence of several process parameters upon the powder characteristics is studied. Parameters are jets' velocity (0.25 m s-1 to 25.92 m s-1), molar ratio solvent/CO2 (2.5% to 20%), temperature (313 K to 343 K), pressure (10 MPa to 20 MPa) and sulfathiazole concentration in the organic solution (0.5% to 1.8%). Two solvents are used: acetone and methanol. Smaller particles with a more homogeneous morphology are obtained from acetone solutions. For the smallest jets' velocity, corresponding to a non-atomized jet, the stable polymorphic form is obtained, pure or in mixture. At this velocity, pressure is the most influential parameter controlling the polymorphic nature of the powder formed. The pure stable polymorph is formed at 20 MPa. Concerning the particle size, the most influential parameters are temperature and sulfathiazole concentration. The use of impinging jets with different process parameters allows the crystallization of four polymorphs among the five known, and particle sizes are varied. This work demonstrates the studied device ability of the polymorph and the size control. A comparison with the classical SAS process shows that particle size, size distribution and morphology of particles crystallized with impinging jets are different from the ones obtained with classical SAS introduction device in similar operating conditions. Mean particle sizes are significantly smaller and size distributions are narrower with impinging jets device.\n\nOrigin of Pre-Coronal-Jet Minifilaments: Flux Cancellation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPanesar, N. K.; Sterling, A. C.; Moore, R. L.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe recently investigated the triggering mechanism of ten quiet-region coronal jet eruptions and found that magnetic flux cancellation at the neutral line of minifilaments is the main cause of quiet-region jet eruptions (Panesar et al 2016). However, what leads to the formation of the pre-jet minifilaments remained unknown. In the present work, we study the longer-term evolution of the magnetic field that leads to the formation of pre-jet minifilaments by using SDO/AIA intensity images and concurrent line of sight SDO/HMI magnetograms. We find that each of the ten pre-jet minifilaments formed due to progressive flux cancellation between the minority-polarity and majority-polarity flux patches (with a minority-polarity flux loss of 10% - 40% prior to minifilament birth). Apparently, the flux cancellation between the opposite polarity flux patches builds a highly-sheared field at the magnetic neutral line, and that field holds the cool transition region minifilament plasma. Even after the formation of minifilaments, the flux continues to cancel, making the minifilament body more thick and prominent. Further flux cancellation between the opposite-flux patches leads to the minifilament eruption and a resulting jet. From these observations, we infer that flux cancellation is usually the process that builds up the sheared and twisted field in pre-jet minifilaments, and that triggers it to erupt and drive a jet.\n\nFormation and extraction of a dense plasma jet from a helicon-plasma-injected inertial electrostatic confinement device\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUlmen, Benjamin Adam\n\nAn inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) device has several pressure and grid-geometry dependent modes of operation for the confinement of plasma. Although the symmetric grid star-mode is the most often studied for its application to fusion, the asymmetric grid jet-mode has its own potential application for electric space propulsion. The jet-mode gets its name from the characteristic bright plasma jet emanating from the central grid. In this dissertation work, a full study was undertaken to provide an understanding on the formation and propagation of the IEC plasma jet-mode. The IEC device vacuum system and all diagnostics were custom assembled during this work. Four diagnostics were used to measure different aspects of the jet. A spherical plasma probe was used to explore the coupling of an external helicon plasma source to the IEC device. The plasma current in the jet was measured by a combination of a Faraday cup and a gridded energy analyzer (GEA). The Faraday cup also included a temperature sensor for collection of thermal power measurements used to compute the efficiency of the IEC device in coupling power into the jet. The GEA allowed for measurement of the electron energy spectra. The force provided by the plasma jet was measured using a piezoelectric force sensor. Each of these measurements provided an important window into the nature of the plasma jet. COMSOL simulations provided additional evidence needed to create a model to explain the formation of the jet. It will be shown that the jet consists of a high energy electron beam having a peak energy of approximately half of the full grid potential. It is born near the aperture of the grid as a result of the escaping core electrons. Several other attributes of the plasma jet will be presented as well as a way forward to utilizing this device and operational mode for future plasma space propulsion.\n\nEffect of Production Process on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Copper Coatings of Jet Charges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGleener, R. E.; Cheerova, M. N.; Shadiev, B. Sh.; Katyukhin, E. B.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSpecial features of formation of the grain structure and mechanical properties of copper during recrystallization annealing after cold deformation with a wide range of reduction are studied. The constants of the Hall-Petch equation are determined for copper, the microstructure of which forms in the course of plastic deformation and subsequent heat treatment. The results of the study are allowed for in the process of production of claddings for jet charges.\n\nDeflection of jets induced by jet-cloud and jet-galaxy interactions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMendoza, S.; Longair, M. S.\n\n2001-06-01\n\nThe model first introduced by Raga & CantÃ³ in which astrophysical jets are deflected on passing through an isothermal high-density region is generalized by taking into account gravitational effects on the motion of the jet as it crosses the high-density cloud. The problem is also generalized for relativistic jets in which gravitational effects induced by the cloud are neglected. Two further cases, classical and relativistic, are discussed for the cases in which the jet is deflected on passing through the interstellar gas of a galaxy in which a dark matter halo dominates the gravitational potential. The criteria for the stability of jets due to the formation of internal shocks are also discussed.\n\nMetal and polymer melt jet formation by the high-power laser ablation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYoh, Jack J.; Gojani, Ardian B.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe laser-induced metal and polymer melt jets are studied experimentally. Two classes of physical phenomena of interest are: first, the process of explosive phase change of laser induced surface ablation and second, the hydrodynamic jetting of liquid melts ejected from a beamed spot. We focus on the dynamic link between these two distinct physical phenomena in a framework of forming and patterning of metallic and polymer jets using a high-power Nd:YAG laser. The microexplosion of ablative spot on a target first forms a pocket of hot liquid melt and then it is followed by a sudden volume change of gas-liquid mixture leading to a pressure-induced spray jet ejection into surrounding medium.\n\nJet Propagation Through Irregular Media and the Impact of Lobes on Galaxy Formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWiita, Paul J.\n\n2004-09-01\n\nWe review results of two- and three-dimensional simulations of jets striking clouds with a view toward determining the conditions under which extragalactic jets might stably survive such collisions, and thereby produce âdog-legâ or wide-angle-tail morphologies. Under most circumstances, the jet either destroys the cloud and has its stability little affected or it stalls and is rapidly destabilized by the impact. But there does appear to be a limited range in parameter space where jets can be deflected by clouds but still survive for an extended period. Some of the effects of radio lobes on protogalactic clouds are also considered. At redshifts above 2, the number of radio galaxies (RGs) is much larger than it is in the local universe, and their lobes may well have filled a large fraction of the web of baryonic matter that is still forming galaxies at that epoch. The overpressures in those lobes can trigger extensive star formation on galactic scales and also may have major implications for the spreading of magnetic fields and metals through the intergalactic medium.\n\nRebound and jet formation of a fluid-filled sphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKillian, Taylor W.; Klaus, Robert A.; Truscott, Tadd T.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis study investigates the impact dynamics of hollow elastic spheres partially filled with fluid. Unlike an empty sphere, the internal fluid mitigates some of the rebound through an impulse driven exchange of energy wherein the fluid forms a jet inside the sphere. Surprisingly, this occurs on the second rebound or when the free surface is initially perturbed. Images gathered through experimentation show that the fluid reacts more quickly to the impact than the sphere, which decouples the two masses (fluid and sphere), imparts energy to the fluid, and removes rebound energy from the sphere. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of acceleration, momentum and an energy method suggesting an optimal fill volume in the neighborhood of 30%. While the characteristics of the fluid (i.e., density, viscosity, etc.) affect the fluid motion (i.e., type and size of jet formation), the rebound characteristics remain similar for a given fluid volume independent of fluid type. Implications of this work are a potential use of similar passive damping systems in sports technology and marine engineering.\n\nIntegrated coke, asphalt and jet fuel production process and apparatus\n\nDOEpatents\n\nShang, Jer Y.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA process and apparatus for the production of coke, asphalt and jet fuel m a feed of fossil fuels containing volatile carbon compounds therein is disclosed. The process includes the steps of pyrolyzing the feed in an entrained bed pyrolyzing means, separating the volatile pyrolysis products from the solid pyrolysis products removing at least one coke from the solid pyrolysis products, fractionating the volatile pyrolysis products to produce an overhead stream and a bottom stream which is useful as asphalt for road pavement, condensing the overhead stream to produce a condensed liquid fraction and a noncondensable, gaseous fraction, and removing water from the condensed liquid fraction to produce a jet fuel-containing product. The disclosed apparatus is useful for practicing the foregoing process. the process provides a useful method of mass producing and jet fuels from materials such as coal, oil shale and tar sands.\n\nProtostellar Jets: The Revolution with ALMA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPodio, Linda\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFast and collimated molecular jets as well as slower wide-angle outflows are observed since the earliest stages of the formation of a new star, when the protostellar embryo accretes most of its final mass from the dense parental envelope. Early theoretical studies suggested that jets have a key role in this process as they can transport away angular momentum thus allowing the star to form without reaching its break-up speed. However, an observational validation of these theories is still challenging as it requires to investigate the interface between jets and disks on scales of fractions to tens of AUs. For this reason, many questions about the origin and feedback of protostellar jets remain unanswered, e.g. are jets ubiquitous at the earliest"
