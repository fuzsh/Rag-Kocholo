        "text": "Of interest and importance prior to the official establishment of the HYD was the state-of-the-art of hydraulics within ASME between its founding in 1880 and the establishment of HYD in 1926 (Figs. 1–3). There were many articles on fluid-related topics in the ASME Transactions and Mechanical Engineering (ME) between 1880 and 1930, as listed in Table 1 from Refs. [1] and [2]. The 1930 paper in ME “Fifty Years' Progress in Hydraulics” by Moody (Fig. 1) and Van Leer [3] had numerous articles, including theoretical hydraulics, water hammer, fluid metering, the Pelton wheel, American hydraulic turbines, and pumping machines.\n\nTable 1\n\nSubjectArticlesFlow of Fluids29Fluid Meters64Hydraulics31Hydraulic Turbines35Hydroelectric Power Plants25Hydraulic Pumps3Reciprocating Pumps11Rotary Pumps5Centrifugal Pumps22Pumping Plants16\n\nSubjectArticlesFlow of Fluids29Fluid Meters64Hydraulics31Hydraulic Turbines35Hydroelectric Power Plants25Hydraulic Pumps3Reciprocating Pumps11Rotary Pumps5Centrifugal Pumps22Pumping Plants16\n\nThe development of hydroelectric power stations necessitated the understanding of hydraulic turbine performance. This technology was a major element in design of hydraulic turbines—Francis, Kaplan, and Pelton designs. Moreover, there were issues beyond the design of turbines, namely, water hammer, cavitation, and flow measurement, and technical areas of interest to mechanical engineers (principally ASME). Because of the promise of power output from hydroelectric power stations, flow measurement was critical, resulting in improvement of various techniques including impulse–momentum (Gibson Method, Fig. 2), salt-velocity method attributed to Allen (Fig. 3), and venturimeter for smaller pipes enhanced by Herschel for smaller piping systems.\n\nJohn R. Freeman (Fig. 4) was the star in the hydraulic activity over the 50-year period from 1880 to 1930, conducting experiments on head loss in pipes and determining the characteristics of fire nozzles. He was aware of the fact that European hydraulic laboratories were far more advanced than those in the U.S. He set out to remedy the deplorable situation by visits to Europe and the encouragement of these laboratories to encourage visitors from the U.S. as well as write reports of their investigations. This effort led to a comprehensive report [4], an article in German, which was later translated into English [5].\n\nThe ASME Freeman Fund was established in 1926 by John R. Freeman, noted Hydraulic Engineer and Scholar, Honorary Member, 24th President of ASME, and recipient of the Society's Gold Medal. Mr. Freeman's active life was crowded with achievements in many fields. To an unusual degree, he brought the benefits of engineering to humanity in many lands, giving his energy and his money unselfishly to meritorious causes and directing his talents to business and to engineering with an enthusiasm and thoroughness that made his pursuit of both these professions successful. Exemplifying his unselfish character, Mr. Freeman suggested a flexible program for utilization of the ASME Freeman Fund when he gave in trust to the Society securities, valued at $25,000. It was stipulated that income be devoted in general to research. Mr. Freeman expressed his wish that, for the moment, part of the income from the gift be used to guarantee the publication of the translation and printing of the German work on Hydraulics (representing extraordinary research in that field). He also recommended traveling scholarships for engineering students. In early years, it supported fellowships for the study of hydraulic laboratory practice in Europe, later it supported publication of important hydraulic research data, and lately, it has been granted to support research programs in hydraulics and fluid mechanics. Up until 1938, an article entitled “Progress in Hydraulics” was published periodically in ME and in the ASME Transactions.\n\nMention should also be made of Robert Henry Thurston, who was the first president of ASME, as well as an educator and an accomplished mechanical engineer. Little is known about his expertise in the design of steam piping systems for heating in cities and for power plant applications. Moreover, he published an article in ASME Transactions in 1883 regarding water hammer in steam lines that, due to inactivity for a period of time, allowed the formation of condensate [6]. Introduction of hot steam in a dormant line with condensate is a current issue and is termed condensation-induced water hammer. Although the application was for single-phase water hammer, it should be noted that the first technical committee established under HYD auspices in 1931 was the Water Hammer committee. The Thurston Lecture is an annual society level award recommended by Basic Engineering Group (BETGOB).\n\nFor nearly 46 years, ASME members with an interest in hydraulics had no home of their own but still met at least once annually at the Winter Annual Meeting (WAM) or with other divisions—mainly with the Power Division. There was, however, a ground swell of interest in establishing a division with interest solely in hydraulics. On November 25, 1925, Dr. Lewis F. Moody led the effort as temporary chairman to formulate a petition for establishment of a professional division entitled Hydraulic Division (HYD), which was endorsed by 146 ASME members without any dissenter. Notable cosigners of the petition were C. M. Allen, Worcester Poly; R. L. Daugherty, Caltech; W. F. Durand, Stanford; J. R. Freeman, Industry; N. R. Gibson, Industry; L. F. Harza, Industry; A. Hollander, Berkeley; S. L. Kerr, Industry; J. N. LeConte, Berkeley; C. T. Main, Industry; L. F. Moody, Consulting Engineer; and R. S. Quick, Industry.\n\nOver the next three decades as the activities of HYD developed, committees were formed to cover specific areas of interest. The establishment and history of the Water Hammer (1931) and Cavitation (1937) committees are found in Sec. 5 on Committee Histories, as well as of the following four other original committees: Hydraulic Prime Movers (1938), Pumping Machinery (1938), Compressors (1950), and Fluid Mechanics (1957).\n\nThese committees were sometimes called subcommittees at various times over the years, and the ones existing now—including those added in subsequent years—are called Technical Committees.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the HYD continued to be active in not only the traditional areas of hydraulics, namely, turbine and pump design and performance, but also emerging problems of water hammer, surge tank simulation, and cavitation. Theodore von Kàrmàn, (Fig. 5) after arriving at Caltech during 1930, continued to enhance the understanding of turbulence and its effect on fluid resistance, as well as to advise his colleagues in their research endeavors; the main recipient being Robert T. Knapp (Fig. 6), to be referred to later. Of note is the fact that von Kàrmàn received the ASME Medal for his contributions to a vast array of fluid mechanics problems.\n\nDuring the decades 1930 and 1940, there was considerable activity devoted to the understanding of surface resistance to flow, in particular, pressure loss in uniform flow in pipes. In 1944, L. F. Moody, then a professor at the Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, took the friction factor correlations from Colebrook and White and prepared a working graph, which, indeed, is the standard in use today—called the Moody diagram.\n\nThe Hydraulic Division was aptly named at its inception in 1926, continuing emphasizing activities related to hydraulics as fostered by the six original committees. However, industry was changing and topic areas not only embraced hydraulics, but also the need for research and development—principally in the expanding topic area of fluid mechanics—began to have an effect. Opportunities existed in both industry and university settings. Contract work that existed as a result of World War II continued—especially in defense-related fields.\n\nMajor research-oriented universities became active during the 1950s, as reported by Rouse (1976), who referred to the next decade or so as “The Rise in Fluid Mechanics,” leading to the formation of a fluid mechanics committee with R. C. Dean (Fig. 7) as the first chair in 1957. Also, the first specialty conference on hydraulics (HYD) was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, in 1959—of a total of 20 papers, seven could be classified as fluid mechanics papers. Then, in 1963, a newsletter was initiated with R. C. Dean as Editor.\n\nElite universities in New England and California led the way. There was also a groundswell of activity and interest in renaming HYD to more accurately reflect the interest and focus of subcommittee members. The charge to rename HYD to FED was led by Robert C. Dean (MIT)—supported by Stephen Kline (Stanford) (Fig. 8) and Howard Emmons (Harvard) (Fig. 9) with encouragement from A. H. Shapiro (MIT) (Fig. 10). There was, however, a cadre of subcommittee members from Water Hammer and Hydraulic Prime Movers who strongly supported the name HYD, as it suited their activities. As described by Rouse [7], a well-respected individual who brought the hydraulic-oriented members and fluid mechanics members together was George Wislicenus (Fig. 11). When the vote was taken, the “Old-Timers” were defeated as indicated in Table 2, and the name was changed from HYD to FED in 1963. Moreover, Dean and Kline used their platform to stimulate discussion of unresolved fluid mechanics problems [8].\n\nTable 2\n\nSubcommitteeForAgainstPrime Movers114Water Hammer16Cavitation91Pumping Machinery160Compressors162Fluid Mechanics100Total5323\n\nSubcommitteeForAgainstPrime Movers114Water Hammer16Cavitation91Pumping Machinery160Compressors162Fluid Mechanics100Total5323\n\nChairs of the HYD/FED Executive Committee are listed in Table 3. At this point, a timeline of significant events or milestones in the history of the FED would be helpful to the reader and would put all the subsequent details of the paper in the proper perspective. Therefore, the major FED milestones are presented in Table 4.\n\nTable 3\n\nYearChairYearChairYearChair1926–1929Ely C. Hutchinson1962–1963Robert C. Dean, Jr.1990–1991Clayton Crowe1929–1930Lewis F.

Affected were the technical committees (sometimes called subcommittees over the years) and the other functions of the Division. As we have seen, this had happened in varying degrees from the formation of the Division's technical committees in the 1930s through changes of the names of these committees and the combination of some of them into new ones that took on new areas of interest and reduced activity in other areas. Some committees were formed and then disappeared along with activity in the fields they addressed.\n\nSo the Fluids Engineering Division Executive Committee (FEDEC) at their meeting in late 1989 proposed a review that would ensure better coordination of their committees and would increase participation of the industrial members of the Division in its technical programs. This would address three trends that characterized the new landscape, namely, (a) the increase in fluids engineering industrial applications in addition to traditional fluid machinery (pumps and turbines), (b) a fusion of the disciplines of that traditional fluid machinery area, and (c) increased research in basic flows in the fluid mechanics discipline.\n\nAccordingly, under the direction of Chair Tom Morel, the FEDEC solicited input from the technical committee and coordinating group chairs, and from this, they developed a suggested structure. They asked Paul Cooper and Sam Martin to chair an open meeting of the Division on June 4, 1990, at the ASME Spring Fluids Engineering Conference that was held jointly with the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering (CSME) Mechanical Engineering Forum in Toronto on June 3–8, 1990. The purpose of the meeting was for the attendees to examine the operation, structure, and mission of the FED and to consider improvements that would maintain and increase the effectiveness of the FED. Tom Morel presented the FEDEC report, and after discussion, the members authorized the proposed new committee structure, which is shown in the Organization Chart of Fig. 12.\n\nThe major change leading to this chart was the formation of two new technical committees, namely, the Fluid Applications and Systems Technical Committee (FASTC) and a Fluid Mechanics Technical Committee (FMTC). Into FASTC were folded the activities and responsibilities of the former Fluid Machinery Committee (FMaC), the Fluid Transients Committee (FTC), and the portion of the earlier Fluid Mechanics Committee that pertained to engineering applications of Fluid Mechanics. The new FMTC would emphasize fundamental fluid mechanics. The Multiphase Flow Technical Committee (MFTC) continued as before, as did the two coordinating groups—for Fluid Measurements (CGFM) and for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CGCFD).\n\nThe program areas and subcommittee structures within these three committees were defined in a subsequent meeting of members of the FEDEC and the subcommittee chairs in October 1990, as shown, respectively, in Tables 5–7 [9].\n\nTable 5\n\n1.

Related areas\n\nFor the coordinating groups, the CGFM was charged with working in such areas as fluid meters, laser Doppler anemometry, other optical flow measurement and visualization applications, pressure and temperature measurements, and experimental uncertainty. The CGCFD was to apply computational fluid dynamics techniques to the solution of fluids engineering problems, and the program areas included numerical uncertainty, identification of benchmark cases, and cooperation with similar groups from other technical societies. Both groups were to coordinate with the technical committees in their respective areas of endeavor.\n\nBeside the technical committees and coordinating groups, Fig. 12 also shows the other committees that were recognized as part of the new structure of the FED. First, there were the Standing Committees listed in the right-most column of the figure. Up top is the then newly created Advisory Board to the FEDEC, which consisted of resource persons such as past FEDEC members, past technical committee and coordinating group chairs, senior members of the Division, and others familiar with the programs of FED and fluids engineering. They advised the FEDEC in future technical programs, industry, government, and university cooperation, the FED Student Papers Contest, and agendas for special programs and other topics.\n\nWith regard to the foregoing changes in the technical committees and coordinating groups, these are simply developments in the evolution that has been a feature of the existence of the FED from the foundation of the Division. This evolution up to the present time can be seen in Fig. 13.\n\nNote, in this figure, that the previous significant change was the formation of the Fluid Machinery Committee in 1968 by combining within it the activities of the earlier committees on Hydraulic Prime Movers (mainly hydraulic turbines formed in 1938), Pumping Machinery (also formed in 1938), and Compressors (1950). The name of the Cavitation Committee (formed in 1937) was changed to the Polyphase Flow Committee (PFC) in 1970, thereby including in its mission all types of flow with more than one phase, cavitation being only one of these. Then, in 1982, conforming to general terminology for such flows, this became known as the MFTC.\n\nFinally, it will be noted from Fig. 13 that the two coordinating groups became technical committees in 2002, namely, the Fluid Measurements and Instrumentation Technical Committee (FMITC) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics Technical Committee (CFDTC). Also, at that time the new Micro and Nano Fluid Dynamics Technical Committee (MNFDTC) came into existence.\n\nThe 1990 restructuring of the FED Technical Committees and Coordinating Groups was a watershed event in the development history of the FED, not only because of the actual changes that were made but also because it established a mindset that would facilitate further changes if and when future needs might demonstrate a need to do so. In that sense, the line-up of these technical committees and coordinating groups can now be viewed as a snapshot which addressed the prevailing needs of the fluids engineering community at that point in time.\n\nFor example, as described above, just 12 years later in 2002, the respective roles, missions, and involvements of the two Coordinating Groups—on Fluid Measurements and on CFD—had developed sufficiently to merit upgrading them to full status as Technical Committees.\n\nTo get a sense of the dynamics involved in such developments, it is instructive for us to fill out the story of each of these Technical Committees from their foundation to the present day. Of particular note, as shown in Fig. 13, 1938 saw a major reorganization of the HYD—akin to 1990 in importance—when it added three more committees, another having just been formed in 1937. Thus, for the first time, there were then five fully functioning committees, which for the most part remained active and prominent for the next 30 years.\n\nThe FASTC today has its roots in five earlier committees that began in the 1930s and later. These committees were led by distinguished engineers and academicians and were influential in their time. Also, as shown in Fig. 13, others underwent permutations and name changes. Still others were formed and later phased out. These developments can be traced by studying the ASME Society Records from 1927 to 1978 [10]. The FED Newsletters, which have been published annually in the spring since the first one appeared in 1963 under the editorship of Dr. Robert C. Dean, have carried the record forward to the present. The respective histories of these groups are described in the following paragraphs.\n\nFounded in 1931, this was the first technical committee formed by the HYD—then just 4 years old. In those days, such committees reported to the Executive Committee (just as the technical committees do today), but each was simply called a “committee” (or “subcommittee”). According to the ASME Society Records, they all became “subcommittees” in 1957; however, in 1964, they are listed as “committees” again. Finally, in 1972, they all officially incorporated “technical committee” in each name [10].\n\nStarting out as the Water Hammer Committee, the name was changed in 1965 to the more general Fluid Transients Committee. Dave Wiggert, Committee member and Chair (1980–1982), described this committee and its activities as follows [11]:\n\nThe Society has been active in promoting research and disseminating information related to waterhammer and fluid transients beginning in 1931, when a Standing Committee on Waterhammer was formed. The first Symposium on Water Hammer, jointly sponsored with the American Society of Civil Engineers Power Division was held in 1933, and in 1935, the Waterhammer Committee was officially recognized by the Hydraulic Division. S. Logan Kerr was the first chairman and remained in that position until 1956; additional members of the original committee were Mr. Gibson (Fig. 2 and member 1935–1953), Strowger, Halmos, Moody (Fig. 1 and member 1935–1953), and Quick. As mentioned by Kerr in the introduction to the Symposium, efforts of the committee included compiling and translating literature from Europe, reviewing waterhammer theory and analyzing available experimental data to confirm the various theories and formulas. At the Symposium, a testimonial was presented to Lorenzo Allievi in recognition of his contributions to the theory of water hammer, see Fig. 14. It is noteworthy to mention that two reprints of the Symposium were made in 1949 and 1961. A second symposium was held in 1937.\n\nIn the 1930s, the graphical method of waterhammer analysis was developed in Europe and elsewhere by Schnyder, Bergeron, Angus, and others. ASME sponsored the translation of the treatise by Bergeron titled “Water Hammer in Hydraulics and Wave Surges in Electricity,” which elegantly described the graphical method and was published in 1961 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc. In 1965, a third symposium, entitled “Waterhammer in Pumped Storage Projects” was presented. This may be one of the earliest publications to mention the use of digital computation for the analysis of waterhammer. In the same year, with V. L. Streeter as Chairman, the name of the Committee was changed to FTC; this was done in part to encompass the diverse interests of the committee members and participants which included topics, such as biological, two-dimensional, and two-phase flows and flows in aircraft hydraulic systems, power plant piping, oil pipelines, among others.\n\nA revitalization of the Committee took place in the 1970s; in addition to traditional waterhammer, its scope was expanded to include unsteady flow, fluid–structure interaction, and vibrations. The impetus for change resulted from a task force study spearheaded by P. Rothe and C. S. Martin beginning in 1975. Recommendations included a broadening of fluid transients topics, outreach to interested industrial practitioners, and an increase in the offering of symposia. A significant number of symposia and forums were sponsored by the FTC between 1970 and 1990. These are found in Sec. 6 on Conferences, Symposia, and Forums.\n\nPast Chairmen of the Water Hammer Committee/FTC are given in Table 8. The fluid transients component of the FASTC has continued to remain active inasmuch as the discipline continues to evolve, new applications interestingly appear, and practitioners around the world look to ASME to provide leadership in offering venues for disseminating state-of-the-art information.\n\nTable 8\n\nYearChair1932–1957S.

This certainly can be said of the FMaC and its three predecessor committees, namely: (1) Hydraulic Prime Movers, (2) Pumping Machinery—both formed in 1938—and (3) Compressors (1950), all of which were folded into the FMaC in 1968.\n\nTable 9\n\nYearChair1938–1948J.

McCormack\n\n(1)\n\nThe Hydraulic Prime Movers Committee (HPMC) was chaired by J. Frank Roberts for its first 10 years (from 1938) as seen in the list of the chairs of this committee in Table 9. In those years for which the ASME Records have lists of the members of the committees, the HPMC had as many as 19 members (1958). Large hydraulic turbines were a major emphasis of the HPMC, and it was in the 30 years of its existence that the country saw so much of the development of its hydropower infrastructure.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Pumping Machinery Committee (PMC) was chaired by Robert L. Daugherty (Fig. 15) for its first 10 years and had various sponsors during that time and always B. F. Tillson and Hans Ulmann as members. When Robert Folsom became the chair in 1948, A. Hollander, A. J. Stepanoff, and some others became members for the first time. The committee soon grew to include others, notably George Wislicenus, with ten members in 1952, when James W. Daily (Fig. 16) was Chair. Membership reached 20 in 1959. The PMC and the FTC were perhaps the most important continuing influences within the newly formed Fluid Machinery Committee (1968). It is therefore appropriate at this point to list in Table 10 the chairs of the PMC/FMaC from its founding in 1938 until it became part of the FASTC in 1990. This list is a roll call of academicians and engineers who were involved with some of the most important pumps and pump research and technology of their day, such as Professor Daugherty, Professor Daily, and Professor Kittredge and engineers Lewis Kessler, Fred Antunes, Alexander Agostinelli, and Sankaraiyer Gopalakrishnan. In later years, the membership and participation in the work of these committees grew to encompass large lists of engineers and academicians in the particular areas addressed. For example, in 1973, the FMaC consisted of 100 active members and 67 associate members.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Compressors Committee (CC) was first chaired in 1950 by A. M. G. Moody for 3 years, successive chairs serving for 2 years each as seen in Table 11. Government and academic researchers such as Joseph Hamrick and George Serovy were among those who served as chairs, and the committee had vice chairs who were responsible for centrifugal, turbomachinery, and reciprocating compressors. This committee appears to have been spun off from the Pumping Machinery Committee, as the ASME records show several pump engineers such as Stepanoff, Gilman, Church, Folsom and Gartman as members of this CC as well as the PMC. However, the CC took on a life of its own and reached a membership of 19 in 1958, which is similar to the numbers reported for the HPMC and the PMC.\n\n(4)\n\nAnother, albeit short-lived, committee that appears to have been spun off from the PMC—and could therefore be associated with the committees that were eventually folded into the FMaC—was the Positive Displacement Hydraulic Machinery Committee, which was formed in 1948 and chaired by W. E. Wilson for 3 years and had the same 11 members listed for those years, ending in 1950.\n\n(5)\n\nAnother short-lived committee that could be regarded as being under the Fluid Machinery umbrella was the Fluid Power Systems Subcommittee, which was formed in 1957 and chaired by O. S. Carliss for 5 years through 1961. It had seven members, including Hemeon, Laird, Messaros, and Vaugn.\n\n(6)\n\nNext, even though fluidics is probably not a fluid-machinery-related subject, we should mention at this point the one remaining relatively short-lived committee shown in Fig. 13, namely, the Fluidics Committee. This committee was formed in 1967 with Forbes Brown as Chair, and it was organized jointly by the FED and the Automatic Controls Division. As seen in Table 12, it had a series of chairs that ended with Milton Franke in the 1976, after which the committee was transferred over totally to the Automatic Controls Division.\n\nTable 10\n\nYearChairProfessional affiliation1938–1948Robert L.

Those that were repeated periodically continued to be sponsored by the FASTC after 1990.\n\nOf particular interest to many colleagues who appreciated his leadership in the FED and especially the fluid machinery field within the FASTC, was a technical session honoring Sankaraiyer Gopalakrishnan (Fig. 17), who had passed away in September 2005, was held at the FEDSM-2006 in Miami, FL [12]. His genius in fulfilling the ASME mission of the advancement and interchange of technology via projects within his own industry and involving academia and the ASME was chronicled at this session [13], and the first recipient of the Sankaraiyer Gopalakrishnan Flowserve Pump Technology Award was honored at the close of that memorial session in Miami.\n\nThe list of chairs who served from the formation of FASTC in 1990 to date is seen in Table 13. (See the listings in Sec. 6 on Conferences, Symposia, and Forums for all the symposia and forums sponsored by all the committees and Sec. 8 on FED Honors and Awards for a presentation of all the FED-related ASME awards and awardees.)\n\nTable 13\n\nYearChairProfessional affiliation1990–1992Steven ZakemIndustry1992–1994Thomas B.

The materials transferred at that time are found under Item 3 of Table 5, wherein Bajura listed the subjects covered under the program area called Industrial and Environmental Applications. (Positive Displacement Compressors, Pumps, and Motors—the first subject listed—had been added to what otherwise are the “applied” fluid mechanics subjects taken under FASTC cognizance.) Table 6 shows the basic fluid mechanics program areas that were retained by the FMTC and so effectively have remained under its cognizance down to the present.\n\nThat said, the FMTC has a long and venerable history, effectively harking back to 1938, when Murrough O'Brien (Fig. 18) and others saw the need for research into and understanding of the fluid dynamical principles involved in the hydraulic machinery, installations, etc., that were being developed at the time. Accordingly, they formed the Committee on General Hydraulics, with O'Brien as Chair. The committee carried on for 3 years, its concerns apparently having been absorbed into the other committees after 1940, when it ceased to exist.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that Murrough O'Brien had established the precedent for a separate committee dedicated to fluid mechanics. This may have been a factor in the process that led to the establishment in 1957 of the Fluid Mechanics Committee under the Chairmanship of Robert C. Dean (Fig. 7). What is indisputable is that Bob Dean was passionate about the many applications and possibilities for applying the science of fluid mechanics that were arising, knowing that progress in this area also required advancement in the science itself. His vision was for the HYD to meet this challenge in three ways, the first of which was to establish a dedicated and focused Fluid Mechanics Committee within the division. This inevitably led to the second way, which was to change the name of the division in 1963. And finally, in 1973, he would create and become the first editor of the new Journal of Fluids Engineering (JFE)—a part of the Transactions of the ASME. The Fluid Mechanics Committee was therefore an essential element in the total transformation that Dean brought about by driving this rebirth of the Division to serve the evolving fluids engineering reality that he saw so clearly.\n\nWhile the FMTC started by addressing both the applied and basic subject areas of fluid mechanics as seen in Tables 5 and 6, over the years that followed, it had taken on so much in so many subject areas—namely, the basic ones of Table 6 and many of applied areas of Table 5—that the latter had to be spun off into the FASTC in the 1990 restructuring in order to maintain a balance in the technical committee structure so as to aid the progress and growth of the FED. The many symposia and forums sponsored by the FMTC are found in Sec. 6 on Conferences, Symposia, and Forums. The chairs of the committee are listed in Table 14.\n\nTable 14\n\nYearChairProfessional affiliation1957–1958Robert C. DeanIndustry1958–1960Stephen J. KlineAcademia1960–1962Jackson E.

(Bill) Morgan (Fig. 19) has provided the following detail about this venerable FED technical committee [14,15].\n\nThe founding of the Cavitation Committee came out of sessions devoted to cavitation at the 1935 ASME annual meeting. ME, November 1935, Vol. 57 included the following information under the HYD's report: “At the 1935 annual meeting, two sessions will be devoted to the study of Cavitation and have been arranged in cooperation with the Power Division of the ASCE and the Applied Mechanics Division of the ASME.” The two cavitation papers which were presented at the 1935 ASME annual meeting were: “Cavitation Testing of Model Hydraulic Turbines and Its Bearing on Design and Operation” by L. M. Davis and “Cavitation Testing Propeller Pumps” by A. Tenor.\n\nME, 1937, reported the following: “On June 25 and 26, 1937, there was a joint meeting of the Applied Mechanics and Hydraulic Divisions in Ithaca, NY. On Saturday morning, there was a discussion on the pitting resistance of metal under cavitation conditions and the relative resistance to cavitation erosion by the vibratory method. Saturday afternoon was devoted to a round-table conference by the HYD on present status of cavitation research in the U.S. and Canada. It was an unusual privilege to have representatives from all the groups now engaged in cavitation research present to discuss this problem and to report upon their work and the programs contemplated for the future. The following research investigations were reported upon: Pennsylvania Water & Power Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, University of Toronto, Shawinigan Water & Power Corporation, Canada, and U.S. Naval Propeller Testing Laboratory. Following the discussion of the research program, the meeting was thrown open to discussion on the definition of cavitation action, and it was generally agreed that a sharp distinction should be drawn between cavitation itself and the pitting or erosive action resulting from cavitation. A subcommittee of the main Cavitation Committee is to be appointed to prepare a definition, which would be recommended, for general use. Subcommittees are also being organized to prepare recommended methods for determining the relative resistance of materials to pitting under cavitation conditions and also for the recommended methods by which the characteristics of turbines, pumps, and propellers can be established under cavitation conditions.”\n\nFrom this information, one can conclude that the Cavitation Committee of the Hydraulic Division was formed in 1937. The ASME Society Records [10], Part 1, lists for 1937 the following under the HYD: Committee on Cavitation, C. F. Merriam, Sponsor (Chairman to be appointed). The ASME Society Records list the following as in office 1 January 1938: Committee on Cavitation, C. F. Merriam, Sponsor and Lewis F. Moody, Chairman (Fig. 1). Moody served as Chairman through 1947. R. T. Knapp (Fig. 6) became Chairman and Sponsor in 1948 but by 1950, the position of Sponsor had been dropped. Sponsors during the term of L. F. Moody as Chairman were: 1938, C. F. Merriam; 1939–1943, E. B. Strowger; and 1944–1947, R. E. B. Sharp. The role of Sponsor versus Chairman is unclear from the records. Full Cavitation Committee membership was first listed in the Society records in 1941. Besides the Chairman and Sponsor, the following were listed as committee members: R. T. Knapp (Fig. 6), J. M. Mousson, W. J. Rheingans, and George F. Wislicenus (Fig. 11). There was no change in committee membership, except for sponsors, up through 1947. The ASME Society Records 1948 lists the committee members as R. T. Knapp, Chairman, J. W. Daily, C. H. Hancock, W. B. Hess, W. J. Rheingans, Hunter Rouse (ASCE), R. E. B. Sharp, R. O. Standing, Hans Ulmann, and George F. Wislicenus. In 1959, the committee members were: J. W. Daily (Chairman), C. F. Cheng, W. B. Hess, J. Z. Lichtman, J. Parmakian, K. Pilarczyk, W. J. Rheingans, B. G. Rightmire, L. E. Robinson, Jr., R. S. Sproule, W. W. Weltmer, W. G. Whippen and G. F. Wislicenus. In 1960, the listing of committee members was dropped from the Society records. Chairs of the Committee are listed in Table 15.\n\nTable 15\n\nYearChairProfessional affiliation1937–1938C. F. MerriamIndustry1938–1948Lewis F. MoodyAcademia1948–1957Robert T.

In 1938, the Cavitation Committee held a meeting in Lancaster and Safe Harbor, PA, with an attendance of 50. Also, the Cavitation Committee sponsored a Cavitation Seminar on November 11–13, 1955 in Milwaukee at the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. The first annual HYD National Conference was held in April 1959 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. This has become the annual Summer Conference of the Fluids Engineering Division which negated any need for sole meetings of the Cavitation Committee.\n\nIn the April 1970 Newsletter, a proposed name change for the Cavitation Committee was suggested. “The Cavitation Committee is considering changing its name to reflect a broader coverage than that indicated by the word cavitation. Two suggestions under consideration are the ‘Poly-Phase Flow’ or ‘Multi-Phase Flow’ Committee. Some prefer Poly-Phase since both words are of Greek origin whereas Multi is a word of Latin origin. Dr. Milton Plesset, former chairman of the Committee and a current member of the Executive Committee, is acting as ‘referee’ on this question.” At the WAM in December 1970, the PFC officially came into being. The new technical committee extends the scope of the former Cavitation Committee to the general area of polyphase flow, partly to offset a decline in activity in the field of cavitation and partly to emphasize new areas.\n\nIn 1980, the FED Executive Committee formulated a Task Force consisting of Dick Bajura, Clayton Crowe, and Kumar (Upendra) Rohatgi to review the past activity in the PFC and make recommendations concerning future organizational changes and programs which would broaden both the scope and membership of the Committee. This Task Force reported out in 1982 and recommended a name change to the Multiphase Flow Technical Committee and that the Committee should consider the constituent technologies of the various combined flows of liquids, gases, and solids. Thus, the name was changed to the Multiphase Flow Technical Committee in line with the current usage of term “multiphase.” The MFTC held special sessions to celebrate its 75th Anniversary at the 2012 FEDSM in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Committee has sponsored many symposia and forums over the years. Three of these have been large, ongoing symposia at FEDSM conferences since 1990 (see Sec. 6 on Conferences, Symposia, and Forums.)\n\nMost of the material in this section was provided by Dr. Frank M. White, Fig. 20, editor of the JFE from 1979 to 1990 [20].\n\nWhen the American Society of Mechanical Engineers was founded in 1880, the subject of fluids engineering was fractured and awkward. The existing theories were primarily for inviscid fluids and were rarely realistic. Engineers rejected these results and relied entirely upon a variety of experiments, most of which were simply reported in pounds, feet, and seconds. There were no correlating principles.\n\nIn the early 1900s, workers such as Prandtl, Rayleigh, and Reynolds combined theory and experiment into a single discipline, fluid mechanics. In the ensuing century, mechanical engineers have developed the practical and design aspects of fluid flow into a very successful discipline.\n\nFor its first 50 years, all the ASME research papers were published in a single inclusive publication, the Transactions of the ASME. There were a dozen divisions, but only one journal, although conferences allowed for paper groupings. Then, the ASME divisions began to request their own specialized journals, a trend which continues to this day. Moreover, the increase in output of journal-quality archival papers was making it impractical for all of them to appear in a single volume. Currently, there are 30 different journals published by the Society, and they are all under the umbrella of the Transactions of the ASME. The first non-Transactions periodical for fluids engineers was the Journal of Applied Mechanics, which began in 1933. Although primarily devoted to theory, the early JAM published some practical fluids engineering papers, such as flow measurement, duct flow, fluid transients, pumps, and turbines. Many such papers of course also appeared in the Transactions, of which the JAM is today a part.\n\nIn 1959, the science-oriented divisions began two new publications, the Journal of Basic Engineering (JBE), which carried fluids papers, and the Journal of Heat Transfer [21]. Research in fluid dynamics had expanded beyond traditional hydraulics, and in 1963, the Society changed the old Hydraulics name to the Fluids Engineering Division. Workers such as Robert Dean, Stephen Kline, and George Wislicenus urged the formation of a specialized journal. Finally, in 1973, the Society authorized a new publication, the Journal of Fluids Engineering, with Robert Dean as Technical Editor. The first issue was in March 1973.\n\nThe choice of Bob Dean as first editor was inspired. He had leadership, wide-ranging knowledge of fluids engineering, and great organizational ability. He assembled an outstanding board of Associate Editors and a rigorous review process. He demanded conciseness and relevance in all the submitted papers. His Executive Secretary, Marguerite Blaney, began a detailed log of all the papers and set up an efficient system for the entire review process. The journal, under Dean's leadership, quickly took hold and immediately became an important publication on engineering aspects of fluid flow.\n\nBob Dean was an experimentalist and fully aware that data are not correct to six significant figures. In 1975, he announced a requirement for uncertainty in experimental data that all the authors must report in their papers. This was followed in 1986 by a policy, formulated by Associate Editors Patrick Roache, Kirti Ghia, and Frank White for reporting uncertainty of numerical accuracy in computer solutions. Professor White championed this policy, which was later superseded by a much expanded and more specific version in 1994 put forth by the CGCFD with an introduction by Chairman Christopher J. Frietas. These policies, still in effect today, are believed to be the first such requirements in any engineering journal. Indeed, the 1986 original was the first of its kind and was emulated the ASME Journal of Heat Transfer (1994) and several other journals [22].\n\nThe emphasis of the JFE has changed with progress in fluids engineering research. The first issue, March 1973, was divided into five areas: Fluid Transients, Fluid Machinery, Fluid Mechanics, Fluidics, and Polyphase Flow. By 1981, Fluidics had vanished, to be replaced by Fluid Measurements, handled by Bob Dean himself. The journal has always published highly regarded review articles. By 1987, associate editors were added for Numerical Methods, and the term Polyphase was changed to the more euphonious Multiphase Flow. In this new millennium, there are too many diverse topics to mention on the masthead. The number of associate editors has doubled to an average of 20. In spite of a heavy workload, all the ASME editors are dedicated volunteers.\n\nAfter Bob Dean, the JFE had three editors with 10 year terms: Frank White, Demetri Telionis, and Joseph Katz. The present editor, M. J. Andrews, took office in 2010. Since ASME papers are limited in length, data are often published just as a few graphs and a short table. In 1993, Professor Telionis established the JFE Data Bank, in which the complete data from a study can be stored, available to readers. The JFE was the first Transactions journal to be available online. Presently, the entire paper submission, review, and publication process can be achieved online.\n\nThe JFE has grown from a quarterly, publishing 600 pages per year, to bimonthly, and now to a monthly, with 1600 pages per year. The year 1990 saw the growth of papers on microflows, followed more recently by nanoflows. Our new century has seen many CFD papers on large-eddy and detached-eddy results, in addition to direct numerical simulation of turbulence. Although the JFE continues to primarily be an experimental journal, 40% of recent papers have been the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics studies.\n\nThe JFE was an initial success and continues to become even better. It has always been profitable for the Society. The Journal is generally thought to be the leading international publication in the field of engineering applications of fluid flow.\n\nProbably, the most significant development within the ASME after its founding in 1880 and its Power Division thereafter was the formation of the HYD in 1926. This brought together outstanding engineers from industry and academia who addressed the rapidly expanding field of hydraulic machinery and the underlying fluid flows and behavior involved. As the field of fluid flow phenomena and applications expanded, the inevitable change of the name of this division to the FED took place in 1963. Today's pattern of technical committees had already emerged in the early 1930s, with the formation of the Water Hammer, Cavitation, Hydraulic Prime Movers, and Pumping Machinery Committees and a short-lived “General Hydraulics” Committee that presaged the 1957 founding of the Fluid Mechanics Committee. These committees developed technical programs in which many landmark papers in the fluids engineering field were presented at conferences they organized and published in the journals of the Transactions of the ASME. One of these is the JFE, which started in 1973 and which was and remains dedicated solely to the FED, being produced by FED members who are the editors and associate editors.\n\nThese accomplishments were due to a procession of engineers and scientists who have been renowned in the field and include names like Lewis F. Moody, John R. Freeman, Robert T. Knapp, Theodore Von Kàrmàn, Robert C. Dean, etc.\n\nMany more FED members have been recognized by their peers through several awards. First are the “Society” awards, namely, the ASME Medal, Honorary Membership, Freeman Scholar, Thurston Lecturer, the Fluids Engineering Award, and the Worthington Medal. Then, there are the “Division” (FED) awards, namely, the Fluid Machinery Design Award, the Gopalakrishnan Flowserve Award, and the Knapp and Moody awards for the authors of outstanding technical papers.\n\nThe timeline of the developments of the FED throughout its 90-year history reveals a flexibility and adaptability to engineering and scientific developments in the fluids engineering disciplines that promise to keep the division providing relevance for present and future engineers and scientists who choose to specialize in this field."
