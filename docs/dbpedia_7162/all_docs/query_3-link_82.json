        "text": "In the last few years, different hypotheses have been formulated to explain the success of populism, focused on socio-economic factors and on the ‘cultural’ components of the crisis of western liberalism. However, the discussion often turned to the unpredictable evolutions of “digital swarms”, to their indifference towards rational arguments, to their inability to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Damiano Palano’s book focuses precisely on the consequences that “digital swarms” can have on our democracies. The goal is, however, not to provide an explanation of the success of the ‘new’ populism, of fake news or of the so-called “post-truth”. More simply, the aim is to up- date the theoretical vocabulary with which to interpret the change we are experiencing. This book – which must be read as a piece of a re- flection in progress – focuses in fact on the implications that the new communication scenario has on contemporary democratic regimes. The thesis is that we are facing a new context, very different not only from the ‘old’ party democracy, but also from the audience democracy. In many ways, the spread of social media seems in fact to mark the decline of the “audience”, at least if it is understood as an audience made basically homogeneous by the existence of ‘generalist’ commu- nication channels. Rather than actually sanctioning mechanisms of dis- intermediation, the spread of new media triggers a fragmentation of the audience into a plurality of segments that tend to have no roots in a common sphere. And so, the public sphere is transformed into a myriad ‘bubbles’ that become largely self-referential and potentially polarized. Taking into account the transformations in the communica- tive scenario, as well as the implications on the relationship between citizens, information and parties, this book proposes the ideal-typical image of a new bubble democracy.\n\nDiscussion of the phenomena of post-truth and fake news often implicates the closed epistemic networks of social media. The recent conversation has, however, blurred two distinct social epistemic phenomena. An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out, perhaps accidentally. An echo chamber is a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited. Members of epistemic bubbles lack exposure to relevant information and arguments. Members of echo chambers, on the other hand, have been brought to systematically distrust all outside sources. In epistemic bubbles, other voices are not heard; in echo chambers, other voices are actively undermined. It is crucial to keep these phenomena distinct. First, echo chambers can explain the post-truth phenomena in a way that epistemic bubbles cannot. Second, each type of structures requires a distinct intervention. Mere exposure to evidence can shatter an epistemic bubble, but may actually reinforce an echo chamber. Finally, echo chambers are much harder to escape. Once in their grip, an agent may act with epistemic virtue, but social context will pervert those actions. Escape from an echo chamber may require a radical rebooting of one’s belief system.\n\n\"Bubbles,\" \"silos,\" \"cocoons,\" \"echo chambers\" are labels now commonly used by media commentators and citizens alike to lament the divided communicative condition of the US electorate. Taken as an indicator of the state of liberal democracy in the US, anxieties about bubbles bespeak the continued potency of the intertwined social and communicative imaginaries of an \"American public\" forged through common participation in a public sphere of discourse. The sorts of media technologies that make such a common space of discourse imaginable have been the topic of much discussion among communications scholars and linguistic anthropologists. But how does a communicative imaginary of bubbles-as a kind of less-than-public sphere-take shape? A significant catalyst, I argue, is the speech of Donald Trump. Here I focus particularly on the incoherent remarks and incredible claims that are a hallmark of Trump's oratory, as well as the media's annotations and fact checks that report and comment on them. Together, Trump's rhetoric and these genres of reporting serve as \"signs of circulation\" that delineate the communicative bubbles in which mainstream media audiences have discovered themselves to be enclosed. As an increasingly compelling communicative imaginary of the polity, these less-than-public spheres now serve as a framework through which people are reorienting themselves to their fellow citizens and their future together.\n\nDigital infospace is intertwined with the lives of each of us with no actual discontinuity. Its epistemic dynamics are immediately part of social discourse. This is exactly why the urgency to confront such a problem arises, today, for any epistemology that wants to contribute to a critical engagement with our shared present. A good starting point for this inquiry is the confusion, frequent in social discourse, between epistemic bubbles and echo chambers. An epistemic bubble is a social epistemic structure that excludes other relevant epistemic sources. It can constitute itself by sheer environmental dynamics, resulting from the accidental cumulation of knowledge and its segregation from external interferences. An echo chamber is instead a social epistemic structure that actively excludes and discredits other relevant epistemic sources. It works towards this exclusion and in the interest of the epistemic agents who promote it. Both are prominent architectural features of the digital infospace that seamlessly influence the general space of knowledge. Questions regarding their structural character, their differences, the role they assign to truth and epistemic agents, and what the virtuous epistemic agent could or should do with respect to those issues are the focus of this issue of \"Azimuth\"."
