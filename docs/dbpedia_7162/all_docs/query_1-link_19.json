        "text": "Governor Greg Abbott today announced that Texas has recruited ten distinguished researchers to Texas A&M University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Houston as part of the Governor’s University Research Initiative (GURI), an effort to lure nationally-recognized researchers to Texas institutions of higher education. The GURI program was one of Governor Abbott’s priorities in the most recent legislative session, aimed at bringing the best and brightest researchers in the world to Texas. Through the GURI program, the Lone Star State will welcome transformative researchers who will in turn serve as economic catalysts to the Texas economy for years to come.\n\n\"Texas is the home of innovation, and with the addition of these world-class scholars to our university faculties, we will continue to lead the nation in cutting-edge research,\" said Governor Abbott. \"This strategic investment in higher education will further elevate future generations of students and faculty at Texas universities while spearheading new breakthroughs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine, all of which are crucial to the long-term success of the Texas economy. I would like to thank GURI Advisory Board Chairman James Huffines and all our advisory board members for their outstanding work. I am proud and deeply honored to welcome these distinguished researchers to the Lone Star State.\"\n\nThe GURI grant awards announced today total $34,292,550 with one-to-one matching grant commitments from each university. Applications to the grant program are accepted on a rolling basis and eligible institutions can apply for matching grants of up to $5 million per distinguished researcher. Grant funds will be used for recruitment costs, including the purchase of research equipment and construction or renovation of facilities necessary to support the distinguished researchers.\n\nThe recipients of the grants announced today feature researchers hailing from across the nation and world, each of whom are members of national honorific societies, including the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and The Royal Society in the United Kingdom:\n\nDr. Girish Saran Agarwal will join the faculty of Texas A&M University beginning September 1, 2016.
