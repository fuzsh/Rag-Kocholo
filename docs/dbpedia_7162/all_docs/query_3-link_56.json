An understanding of the dynamics of vapor bubble generation is useful for developing and optimizing laser-based medical therapies. To this end, experiments in vapor bubble generation with laser light deposited in an aqueous dye solution near a fiber-optic tip have been performed. Numerical hydrodynamic simulations have been developed to understand and extrapolate results from these experiments. Comparison of two-dimensional simulations with the experiment shows excellent agreement in tracking the bubble evolution. Another regime of vapor bubble generation is short-pulse laser interactions with melanosomes. Strong shock generationmoreÂ Â» and vapor bubble generation are common physical features of this interaction. A novel effect of discrete absorption by melanin granules within a melanosome is studied as a possible role in previously reported high Mach number shocks.Â«Â less\n\nVapor bubble generation around gold nano-particles and its application to damaging of cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKitz, M.; Preisser, S.; Wetterwald, A.; Jaeger, M.; Thalmann, G. N.; Frenz, M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe investigated vapor bubbles generated upon irradiation of gold nanoparticles with nanosecond laser pulses. Bubble formation was studied both with optical and acoustic means on supported single gold nanoparticles and single nanoparticles in suspension. Formation thresholds determined at different wavelengths indicate a bubble formation efficiency increasing with the irradiation wavelength. Vapor bubble generation in Bac-1 cells containing accumulations of the same particles was also investigated at different wavelengths. Similarly, they showed an increasing cell damage efficiency for longer wavelengths. Vapor bubbles generated by single laser pulses were about half the cell size when inducing acute damage.

Work on bubble growth and condensation for stationary and translating bubbles is summarized and the differences with bubbles containing a permanent gas stressed. In particular, it is shown that the natural frequency of a vapor bubble is proportional not to the inverse radius, as for a gas bubble, but to the inverse radius raised to the power 2/3. Permanent gas dissolved in the liquid diffuses into the bubble with strong effects on its dynamics. The effects of the diffusion of heat and mass on the propagation of pressure waves in a vaporous bubbly liquid are discussed. Other topics briefly touched on include thermocapillary flow, plasmonic nanobubbles, and vapor bubbles in an immiscible liquid.\n\nDynamics of vapor bubbles growth at boiling resulting from enthalpy excess of the surrounding superheated liquid and sound pulses generated by bubbles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDorofeev, B. M.; Volkova, V. I.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe results of experiments investigating the exponential dependence of the vapor bubble radius on time at saturated boiling are generalized. Three different methods to obtain this dependence are suggested: (1) by the application of the transient heat conduction equation, (2) by using the correlations of energy conservation, and (3) by solving a similar electrodynamic problem. Based on the known experimental data, the accuracy of the dependence up to one percent and a few percent accuracy of its description based on the sound pressure generated by a vapor bubble have been determined. A significant divergence of the power dependence of the vapor bubble radius on time (with an exponent of 1/2) with the experimental results and its inadequacy for the description of the sound pulse generated by the bubble have been demonstrated.\n\nCondensation of vapor bubble in subcooled pool\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoriuchi, K.; Koiwa, Y.; Kaneko, T.; Ueno, I.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe focus on condensation process of vapor bubble exposed to a pooled liquid of subcooled conditions. Two different geometries are employed in the present research; one is the evaporation on the heated surface, that is, subcooled pool boiling, and the other the injection of vapor into the subcooled pool. The test fluid is water, and all series of the experiments are conducted under the atmospheric pressure condition. The degree of subcooling is ranged from 10 to 40 K. Through the boiling experiment, unique phenomenon known as microbubble emission boiling (MEB) is introduced; this phenomenon realizes heat flux about 10 times higher than the critical heat flux. Condensation of the vapor bubble is the key phenomenon to supply ambient cold liquid to the heated surface. In order to understand the condensing process in the MEB, we prepare vapor in the vapor generator instead of the evaporation on the heated surface, and inject the vapor to expose the vapor bubble to the subcooled liquid. Special attention is paid to the dynamics of the vapor bubble detected by the high-speed video camera, and on the enhancement of the heat transfer due to the variation of interface area driven by the condensation.\n\nAcoustic Behavior of Vapor Bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nProsperetti, Andrea; Oguz, Hasan N.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nIn a microgravity environment vapor bubbles generated at a boiling surface tend to remain near it for a long time. This affects the boiling heat transfer and in particular promotes an early transition to the highly inefficient film boiling regime. This paper describes the physical basis underlying attempts to remove the bubbles by means of pressure radiation forces.\n\nCondensation on a noncollapsing vapor bubble in a subcooled liquid\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBaumeister, K. J.; Simoneau, R. J.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAn experimental procedure is presented by which an estimate can be made of the condensation coefficient on a noncollapsing stationary vapor bubble in subcooled liquid nitrogen. Film boiling from a thin wire was used to generate vapor bubbles which remain fixed to the wire at their base. A balance was established between the evaporation in the thin annular region along the wire and the condensation in the vapor bubbles.\n\nHigh-speed microjet generation using laser-induced vapor bubbles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOudalov, Nikolai; Tagawa, Yoshiyuki; Peters, Ivo; Visser, Claas-Willem; van der Meer, Devaraj; Prosperetti, Andrea; Sun, Chao; Lohse, Detlef\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe generation and evolution of microjets are studied both experimentally and numerically. The jets are generated by focusing a laser pulse into a microscopic capillary tube (~50 Î¼m) filled with water-based red dye. A vapor bubble is created instantly after shooting the laser (<1 Î¼s), sending out a shockwave towards the curved free surface at which the high-speed microjet forms. The process of jet formation is captured using high-speed recordings at 1.0 Ã 106 fps. The velocity of the microjets can reach speeds of ~850 m/s while maintaining a very sharp geometry. The high-speed recordings enable us to study the effect of several parameters on the jet velocity, e.g. the absorbed energy and the distance between the laser spot and the free surface.The results show a clear dependence on these variables, even for supersonic speeds. Comparisons with numerical simulations confirm the nature of these dependencies.\n\nRole of entrapped vapor bubbles during microdroplet evaporation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPutnam, Shawn A.; Byrd, Larry W.; Briones, Alejandro M.; Hanchak, Michael S.; Ervin, Jamie S.; Jones, John G.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nOn superheated surfaces, the air bubble trapped during impingement grows into a larger vapor bubble and oscillates at the frequency predicted for thermally induced capillary waves. In some cases, the entrapped vapor bubble penetrates the droplet interface, leaving a micron-sized coffee-ring pattern of pure fluid. Vapor bubble entrapment, however, does not influence the evaporation rate. This is also true on laser heated surfaces, where a laser can thermally excite capillary waves and induce bubble oscillations over a broad range of frequencies, suggesting that exciting perturbations in a pinned droplets interface is not an effective avenue for enhancing evaporative heat transfer.\n\nAcoustically-Enhanced Direct Contact Vapor Bubble Condensation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoziuk, Thomas; Smith, Marc; Glezer, Ari\n\n2017-11-01\n\nRate-limited, direct contact vapor condensation of vapor bubbles that are formed by direct steam injection through a nozzle in a quiescent subcooled liquid bath is accelerated using ultrasonic (MHz-range) actuation. A submerged, low power actuator produces an acoustic beam whose radiation pressure deforms the liquid-vapor interface, leading to the formation of a liquid spear that penetrates the vapor bubble to form a vapor torus with a significantly larger surface area and condensation rate. Ultrasonic focusing along the spear leads to the ejection of small, subcooled droplets through the vapor volume that impact the vapor-liquid interface and further enhance the condensation. High-speed Schlieren imaging of the formation and collapse of the vapor bubbles in the absence and presence of actuation shows that the impulse associated with the collapse of the toroidal volume leads to the formation of a turbulent vortex ring in the liquid phase. Liquid motions near the condensing vapor volume are investigated in the absence and presence of acoustic actuation using high-magnification PIV and show the evolution of a liquid jet through the center of the condensing toroidal volume and the formation and advection of vortex ring structures whose impulse appear to increase with temperature difference between the liquid and vapor phases. High-speed image processing is used to assess the effect of the actuation on the temporal and spatial variations in the characteristic scales and condensation rates of the vapor bubbles.\n\nSteady State Vapor Bubble in Pool Boiling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZou, An; Chanana, Ashish; Agrawal, Amit; Wayner, Peter C.; Maroo, Shalabh C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBoiling, a dynamic and multiscale process, has been studied for several decades; however, a comprehensive understanding of the process is still lacking. The bubble ebullition cycle, which occurs over millisecond time-span, makes it extremely challenging to study near-surface interfacial characteristics of a single bubble. Here, we create a steady-state vapor bubble that can remain stable for hours in a pool of sub-cooled water using a femtosecond laser source. The stability of the bubble allows us to measure the contact-angle and perform in-situ imaging of the contact-line region and the microlayer, on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces and in both degassed and regular (with dissolved air) water. The early growth stage of vapor bubble in degassed water shows a completely wetted bubble base with the microlayer, and the bubble does not depart from the surface due to reduced liquid pressure in the microlayer. Using experimental data and numerical simulations, we obtain permissible range of maximum heat transfer coefficient possible in nucleate boiling and the width of the evaporating layer in the contact-line region. This technique of creating and measuring fundamental characteristics of a stable vapor bubble will facilitate rational design of nanostructures for boiling enhancement and advance thermal management in electronics.

R.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn present study, the rising of superheated vapor bubble in saturated liquid is simulated using volume of fluid method in OpenFOAM cfd package. The surface tension between vapor-liquid phases is considered using continuous surface force method. In order to reduce spurious current near interface, Lafaurie smoothing filter is applied to improve curvature calculation. Phase change is considered using Tanasawa mass transfer model. The variation of saturation temperature in vapor bubble with local pressure is considered with simplified Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The couple velocity-pressure equation is solved using PISO algorithm. The numerical model is validated with: (1) isothermal bubble rising and (2) one-dimensional horizontal film condensation. Then, the shape and life time history of single superheated vapor bubble are investigated. The present numerical study shows vapor bubble in saturated liquid undergoes boiling and condensation. It indicates bubble life time is nearly linear proportional with bubble size and superheat temperature.\n\nShock wave interaction with laser-generated single bubbles.\n\nPubMed\n\nSankin, G N; Simmons, W N; Zhu, S L; Zhong, P\n\n2005-07-15\n\nThe interaction of a lithotripter shock wave (LSW) with laser-generated single vapor bubbles in water is investigated using high-speed photography and pressure measurement via a fiber-optic probe hydrophone. The interaction leads to nonspherical collapse of the bubble with secondary shock wave emission and microjet formation along the LSW propagation direction. The maximum pressure amplification is produced during the collapse phase of the bubble oscillation when the compressive pulse duration of the LSW matches with the forced collapse time of the bubble.\n\nPlasmonic nanoparticle-generated photothermal bubbles and their biomedical applications\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLapotko, Dmitri\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article is focused on the optical generation and detection of photothermal vapor bubbles around plasmonic nanoparticles. We report physical properties of such plasmonic nanobubbles and their biomedical applications as cellular probes. Our experimental studies of gold nanoparticle-generated photothermal bubbles demonstrated the selectivity of photothermal bubble generation, amplification of optical scattering and thermal insulation effect, all realized at the nanoscale. The generation and imaging of photothermal bubbles in living cells (leukemia and carcinoma culture and primary cancerous cells), and tissues (atherosclerotic plaque and solid tumor in animal) demonstrated a noninvasive highly sensitive imaging of target cells by small photothermal bubbles and a selective mechanical, nonthermal damage to the individual target cells by bigger photothermal bubbles due to a rapid disruption of cellular membranes. The analysis of the plasmonic nanobubbles suggests them as theranostic probes, which can be tuned and optically guided at cell level from diagnosis to delivery and therapy during one fast process.

In this context, this paper focuses on the motion of the liquid plug, trapped between vapor bubbles, moving in capillary tubes, to try to better understand the thermo-physical phenomena involved in such devices. This study is divided into three parts. In the first part, an experimental study presents the evolution of the vapor pressure during the evaporation process of a liquid thin film deposited from a liquid plug flowing in a heated capillary tube: it is found that the behavior of the generated and removed vapor can be very different, according to the thermophysical properties of the fluids. In the second part, a transient model allows to compare, in terms of pressure and duration, the motion of a constant-length liquid plug trapped between two bubbles subjected to a constant difference of vapor pressure: the results highlight that the performances of the four fluids are also very different. Finally, a third model that can be considered as an improvement of the second one, is also presented: here, the liquid slug is surrounded by two vapor bubbles, one subjected to evaporation, the pressure in both bubbles is now a result of the calculation. This model still allows comparing the behaviors of the fluid. Even if our models are quite far from a complete model of a real PHP, results do indicate towards the applicability of different fluids as suitable working fluids for PHPs, particularly in terms of the flow instabilities which they generate.\n\nBubble generation during transformer overload\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOommen, T.V.\n\n1990-03-01\n\nBubble generation in transformers has been demonstrated under certain overload conditions. The release of large quantities of bubbles would pose a dielectric breakdown hazard. A bubble prediction model developed under EPRI Project 1289-4 attempts to predict the bubble evolution temperature under different overload conditions. This report details a verification study undertaken to confirm the validity of the above model using coil structures subjected to overload conditions. The test variables included moisture in paper insulation, gas content in oil, and the type of oil preservation system. Two aged coils were also tested. The results indicated that the observed bubble temperatures weremoreÂ Â» close to the predicted temperatures for models with low initial gas content in the oil. The predicted temperatures were significantly lower than the observed temperatures for models with high gas content. Some explanations are provided for the anomalous behavior at high gas levels in oil. It is suggested that the dissolved gas content is not a significant factor in bubble evolution. The dominant factor in bubble evolution appears to be the water vapor pressure which must reach critical levels before bubbles can be released. Further study is needed to make a meaningful revision of the bubble prediction model. 8 refs., 13 figs., 11 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nSteady boiling of vapor bubbles in rectangular channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAjaev, Vladimir S.; Homsy, George M.\n\n2000-11-01\n\nWe consider vapor bubbles in microchannels in which the vapor is produced by a heater element and condenses in cooler parts of the interface. The free boundary problem is formulated for a long steady-state bubble in a rectangular channel with a heated bottom. The shape of the liquid-vapor interface is described using lubrication-type equations in the regime in which the vapor phase fills most of the cross-section. Contact lines may be present, marking the transitions between molecularly thin films and macroscopic ones. The main parameters are the differences between heater, saturation, and top wall temperatures. The equations are solved numerically over a range of parameter values with an integral condition requiring the evaporation near the heater to balance condensation in colder areas of the interface. Depending on the temperature, the side walls can be either dry or covered with a liquid film; we identify criteria for these two different regimes. The asymptotic method breaks down in the limit when capillary condensation becomes important near the bubble top and a different approach is used to determine the shape of the bubble in this limit. Solutions here involve localized regions of large mass fluxes, which are asymptotically matched to capillary-statics regions where the heat transfer is negligible.\n\nTheory of supercompression of vapor bubbles and nanoscale thermonuclear fusion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNigmatulin, Robert I.; Akhatov, Iskander Sh.; Topolnikov, Andrey S.; Bolotnova, Raisa Kh.; Vakhitova, Nailya K.; Lahey, Richard T.; Taleyarkhan, Rusi P.\n\n2005-10-01\n\nThis paper provides the theoretical basis for energetic vapor bubble implosions induced by a standing acoustic wave. Its primary goal is to describe, explain, and demonstrate the plausibility of the experimental observations by Taleyarkhan et al. [Science 295, 1868 (2002); Phys. Rev. E 69, 036109 (2004)] of thermonuclear fusion for imploding cavitation bubbles in chilled deuterated acetone. A detailed description and analysis of these data, including a resolution of the criticisms that have been raised, together with some preliminary HYDRO code simulations, has been given by Nigmatulin et al. [Vestnik ANRB (Ufa, Russia) 4, 3 (2002); J. Power Energy 218-A, 345 (2004)] and Lahey et al. [Adv. Heat Transfer (to be published)]. In this paper a hydrodynamic shock (i.e., HYDRO) code model of the spherically symmetric motion for a vapor bubble in an acoustically forced liquid is presented. This model describes cavitation bubble cluster growth during the expansion period, followed by a violent implosion during the compression period of the acoustic cycle. There are two stages of the bubble dynamics process. The first, low Mach number stage, comprises almost all the time of the acoustic cycle. During this stage, the radial velocities are much less than the sound speeds in the vapor and liquid, the vapor pressure is very close to uniform, and the liquid is practically incompressible. This process is characterized by the inertia of the liquid, heat conduction, and the evaporation or condensation of the vapor. The second, very short, high Mach number stage is when the radial velocities are the same order, or higher, than the sound speeds in the vapor and liquid. In this stage high temperatures, pressures, and densities of the vapor and liquid take place. The model presented herein has realistic equations of state for the compressible liquid and vapor phases, and accounts for nonequilibrium evaporation/condensation kinetics at the liquid/vapor interface. There are interacting\n\nAcoustic wave propagation in bubbly flow with gas, vapor or their mixtures.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yuning; Guo, Zhongyu; Gao, Yuhang; Du, Xiaoze\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPresence of bubbles in liquids could significantly alter the acoustic waves in terms of wave speed and attenuation. In the present paper, acoustic wave propagation in bubbly flows with gas, vapor and gas/vapor mixtures is theoretically investigated in a wide range of parameters (including frequency, bubble radius, void fraction, and vapor mass fraction). Our finding reveals two types of wave propagation behavior depending on the vapor mass fraction. Furthermore, the minimum wave speed (required for the closure of cavitation modelling in the sonochemical reactor design) is analyzed and the influences of paramount parameters on it are quantitatively discussed.

The vapor bubbles are formed by direct injection from a pressurized steam reservoir through nozzles of varying characteristic diameters, and are advected within an acoustic field of programmable intensity. While kHz-range acoustic actuation typically couples to capillary instability of the vapor-liquid interface, ultrasonic (MHz-range) actuation leads to the formation of a liquid spout that penetrates into the vapor bubble and significantly increases its surface area and therefore condensation rate. Focusing of the ultrasonic beam along the spout leads to ejection of small-scale droplets from that are propelled towards the vapor liquid interface and result in localized acceleration of the condensation. High-speed video of Schlieren images is used to investigate the effects of the ultrasonic actuation on the thermal boundary layer on the liquid side of the vapor-liquid interface and its effect on the condensation rate, and the liquid motion during condensation is investigated using high-magnification PIV measurements. High-speed image processing is used to assess the effect of the actuation on the dynamics and temporal variation in characteristic scale (and condensation rate) of the vapor bubbles.\n\nTheranostic Performance of Acoustic Nanodroplet Vaporization-Generated Bubbles in Tumor Intertissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nHo, Yi-Ju; Yeh, Chih-Kuang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSolid tumors with poorly perfused regions reveal some of the treatment limitations that restrict drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) has been applied to directly disrupt vessels and release nanodroplets, ADV-generated bubbles (ADV-Bs), and drugs into tumor tissue. In this study, we investigated the in vivo behavior of ADV-Bs stimulated by US, and evaluated the possibility of moving intertissue ADV-Bs into the poorly perfused regions of solid tumors. Intravital imaging revealed intertissue ADV-B formation, movement, and cavitation triggered by US, where the distance of intertissue ADV-B movement was 33-99 Âµm per pulse. When ADV-Bs were applied to tumor cells, the cell membrane was damaged, increasing cellular permeability or inducing cell death. The poorly perfused regions within solid tumors show enhancement due to ADV-B accumulation after application of US-triggered ADV-B. The intratumoral nanodroplet or ADV-B distribution around the poorly perfused regions with tumor necrosis or hypoxia were demonstrated by histological assessment. ADV-B formation, movement and cavitation could induce cell membrane damage by mechanical force providing a mechanism to overcome treatment limitations in poorly perfused regions of tumors.\n\nTheranostic Performance of Acoustic Nanodroplet Vaporization-Generated Bubbles in Tumor Intertissue\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHo, Yi-Ju; Yeh, Chih-Kuang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSolid tumors with poorly perfused regions reveal some of the treatment limitations that restrict drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy.

In the EDM process, a vapor bubble is generated between the tool and the workpiece in the dielectric liquid due to an electrical discharge. In this process dynamic behavior of the vapor bubble affects machining process. Vibration of the tool surface affects bubble behavior and consequently affects material removal rate (MRR). In this paper, dynamic behavior of the vapor bubble in an ultrasonic assisted EDM process after the appearance of the necking phenomenon is investigated. It is noteworthy that necking phenomenon occurs when the bubble takes the shape of an hour-glass. After the appearance of the necking phenomenon, the vapor bubble splits into two parts and two liquid jets are developed on the boundaries of the upper and lower parts of the vapor bubble. The liquid jet developed on the upper part of the bubble impinges to the tool and the liquid jet developed on the lower part of the bubble impinges to the workpiece. These liquid jets cause evacuation of debris from the gap between the tool and the workpiece and also cause erosion of the workpiece and the tool. Curved tool and workpiece affect the shape and the velocity of the liquid jets during splitting of the vapor bubble. In this paper dynamics of the vapor bubble after its splitting near the curved tool and workpiece is investigated in three cases. In the first case surfaces of the tool and the workpiece are flat, in the second case surfaces of the tool and the workpiece are convex and in the third case surfaces of the tool and workpiece are concave. Numerical results show that in the third case, the velocity of liquid jets which are developed on the boundaries of the upper and lower parts of the vapor bubble after its splitting have the highest magnitude and their shape are broader than the other cases.

As a consequence of the enhanced heat transfer in the presence of convection, this fact may have a major impact on the evolution of a vapor bubble. The effect is particularly strong in the case of a collapsing bubble for which, due to the conservation of the system's impulse, the induced relative velocity tends to be magnified when the bubble volume shrinks. A practical application could be, for instance, the enhancement of the condensation rate of bubbles downstream of a heated region, thereby reducing the quality of a flowing liquid-vapor mixture. A simple model of the process, in which the bubble is assumed to be spherical and the flow potential, is developed in the paper.\n\nEvolution of Vapor Bubbles Nucleation Sites in Low Gravity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuyevich, Yu A.; Webbon, Bruce W.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWhen liquid is expelled by a vapor bubble growing at a nucleation site on a superheated surface, a thin microlayer underneath the bubble is left behind. It is evaporated from the free microlayer surface that provides for bubble growth. The average thickness of the microlayer determining the evaporation rate increases with time if the latter does not exceed a threshold value associated with the burn-out crisis. The bubble is described as a spherical segment with its flattened part adjoining the microlayer. This introduces two independent variables - the radius of the spherical part of the bubble surface and the polar angle that defines the relative area of the flattened part. They are to be found out from a set of two strongly nonlinear equations resulting from mass and momentum conservation laws. The first one depends on both microlayer thickness and nonmonotonously changing bubble base area. The second involves two major factors favoring bubble detachment - the buoyancy and a force due to the initial momentum of vapor input into the bubble. The former force depends on gravity whereas the latter one does not. It is why the limiting regimes of bubble evolution that correspond to normal or moderately reduced gravity and to microgravity feature drastically different properties. In the first case, the buoyancy dominates and the bubble evolves in such a manner as to become a full sphere at a moment that can be viewed as that of detachment. The detachment volume grows as gravity decreases. In the second case, the buoyancy is negligible and the bubble stays near the surface, while its volume continues to increase for a sufficiently long time. The findings are discussed in connection with experimental data obtained under different gravity conditions, some unpublished experiments being included. They help to understand why the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient frequently increases as gravity falls down and eventually vanishes.\n\nNonlinear dynamics of a vapor bubble expanding in a superheated region of finite size\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAnnenkova, E. A., E-mail: a-a-annenkova@yandex.ru; Kreider, W.; Sapozhnikov, O. A.\n\n2015-10-28\n\nGrowth of a vapor bubble in a superheated liquid is studied theoretically. Contrary to the typical situation of boiling, when bubbles grow in a uniformly heated liquid, here the superheated region is considered in the form of a millimeter-sized spherical hot spot. An initial micron-sized bubble is positioned at the hot spot center and a theoretical model is developed that is capable of studying bubble growth caused by vapor pressure inside the bubble and corresponding hydrodynamic and thermal processes in the surrounding liquid. Such a situation is relevant to the dynamics of vapor cavities that are created in soft biologicalmoreÂ Â» tissue in the focal region of a high-intensity focused ultrasound beam with a shocked pressure waveform. Such beams are used in the recently proposed treatment called boiling histotripsy. Knowing the typical behavior of vapor cavities during boiling histotripsy could help to optimize the therapeutic procedure.Â«Â less\n\nSimulation and analysis of collapsing vapor-bubble clusters with special emphasis on potentially erosive impact loads at walls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOgloblina, Daria; Schmidt, Steffen J.; Adams, Nikolaus A.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCavitation is a process where a liquid evaporates due to a pressure drop and re-condenses violently. Noise, material erosion and altered system dynamics characterize for such a process for which shock waves, rarefaction waves and vapor generation are typical phenomena. The current paper presents novel results for collapsing vapour-bubble clusters in a liquid environment close to a wall obtained by computational fluid mechanics (CFD) simulations. The driving pressure initially is 10 MPa in the liquid. Computations are carried out by using a fully compressible single-fluid flow model in combination with a conservative finite volume method (FVM). The investigated bubble clusters (referred to as \"clouds\") differ by their initial vapor volume fractions, initial stand-off distances to the wall and by initial bubble radii. The effects of collapse focusing due to bubble-bubble interaction are analysed by investigating the intensities and positions of individual bubble collapses, as well as by the resulting shock-induced pressure field at the wall. Stronger interaction of the bubbles leads to an intensification of the collapse strength for individual bubbles, collapse focusing towards the center of the cloud and enhanced re-evaporation. The obtained results reveal collapse features which are common for all cases, as well as case-specific differences during collapse-rebound cycles. Simultaneous measurements of maximum pressures at the wall and within the flow field and of the vapor volume evolution show that not only the primary collapse but also subsequent collapses are potentially relevant for erosion.\n\nThe behavior of vapor bubbles during boiling enhanced with acoustics and open microchannels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoziuk, Thomas; Smith, Marc K.; Glezer, Ari\n\n2012-11-01\n\nBoiling heat transfer on a submerged heated surface is enhanced by combining a grid of surface micromachined open channels and ultrasonic acoustic actuation to control the formation and evolution of vapor bubbles and to inhibit the instability that leads to film boiling at the critical heat flux (CHF). The microchannels provide nucleation sites for vapor bubble formation and enable the entrainment of bulk subcooled fluid to these sites for sustained evaporation. Acoustic actuation excites interfacial oscillations of the detached bubbles and leads to accelerated condensation in the bulk fluid, thereby limiting the formation of vapor columns that precede the CHF instability. The combined effects of microchannels and acoustic actuation are investigated experimentally with emphasis on bubble nucleation, growth, detachment, and condensation. It is shown that this hybrid approach leads to a significant increase in the critical heat flux, a reduction of the vapor mass above the surface, and the breakup of low-frequency vapor slug formation. A large-scale model of the microchannel grid reveals details of the flow near the nucleation site and shows that the presence of the microchannels decreases the surface superheat at a given heat flux. Supported by ONR.\n\nThermally activated vapor bubble nucleation: The Landau-Lifshitz-Van der Waals approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGallo, Mirko; Magaletti, Francesco; Casciola, Carlo Massimo\n\n2018-05-01\n\nVapor bubbles are formed in liquids by two mechanisms: evaporation (temperature above the boiling threshold) and cavitation (pressure below the vapor pressure). The liquid resists in these metastable (overheating and tensile, respectively) states for a long time since bubble nucleation is an activated process that needs to surmount the free energy barrier separating the liquid and the vapor states. The bubble nucleation rate is difficult to assess and, typically, only for extremely small systems treated at an atomistic level of detail. In this work a powerful approach, based on a continuum diffuse interface modeling of the two-phase fluid embedded with thermal fluctuations (fluctuating hydrodynamics), is exploited to study the nucleation process in homogeneous conditions, evaluating the bubble nucleation rates and following the long-term dynamics of the metastable system, up to the bubble coalescence and expansion stages. In comparison with more classical approaches, this methodology allows us on the one hand to deal with much larger systems observed for a much longer time than possible with even the most advanced atomistic models. On the other, it extends continuum formulations to thermally activated processes, impossible to deal with in a purely determinist setting.\n\nModeling of Vapor Bubble Growth Under Nucleate Boiling Conditions in Reduced Gravity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuyevich, Yu A.; Webbon, Bruce W.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA dynamic model is developed to describe the evolution of a vapor bubble growing at a nucleation site on a superheated surface under arbitrary gravity. The bubble is separated from the surface by a thin microlayer and grows due to the evaporation from the microlayer interface. The average thickness of the microlayer increases as the bubble expands along the surface if the evaporation rate is lower than some critical value. The corresponding threshold value of the surface temperature has to be associated with the burn-out crisis. Two main reasons make for bubble separation, which are the buoyancy force and a force caused by the vapor momentum that comes to the bubble with vapor molecules. The latter force is somewhat diminished if condensation takes place at the upper bubble surface in subcooled liquids. The action of the said forces is opposed by inertia of the additional mass of liquid as the bubble center rises above the surface and by inertia of liquid being expelled by the growing bubble in radial directions. An extra pressure force arises due to the liquid inflow into the microlayer with a finite velocity. The last force helps in holding the bubble close to the surface during an initial stage of bubble evolution. Two limiting regimes with distinctly different properties can be singled out, depending on which of the forces that favor bubble detachment dominates. Under conditions of moderately reduced gravity, the situation is much the same as in normal gravity, although the bubble detachment volume increases as gravity diminishes. In microgravity, the buoyancy force is negligible. Then the bubble is capable of staying near the surface for a long time, with intensive evaporation from the microlayer. It suggests a drastic change in the physical mechanism of heat removal as gravity falls below a certain sufficiently low level.

The photothermal, mechanical and optical properties of such bubbles were found to be different from those of plasmonic nanoparticle and vapor bubbles as well. This phenomena was considered as a new complex nanosystem â plasmonic nanobubble (PNB). Mechanical and optical scattering properties of PNB depended upon the nanoparticle surface and heat capacity, clusterization state, and the optical pulse length. The generation of the PNB required much higher laser pulse fluence thresholds than the explosive boiling level, and was characterized by the relatively high lower threshold of the minimal size (lifetime) of PNB. Optical scattering by PNB and its diameter (measured as the lifetime) has been varied with the fluence of laser pulse and this has demonstrated the tunable nature of PNB.

To better understand the evolution of stress transients and subsequent formation of vapor bubbles, two-dimensional simulations are presented in channel or cylindrical geometry with the LATIS (LAser TISsue) computer code.

Our investigation shows that this exceptional amount of force results from accumulation of light-generated heat by a micron-sized particle that translates into motion due to a phase transition in the nearby water. High-speed imagery indicates the role of bubble expansion and later collapse in this event. Comparing observations with known models reveals a dynamic behavior controlled by polytropic trapped vapor and the inertia of the surrounding liquid. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated by realization of disordered optical media with binary light-activated switching from opacity to high transparency.\n\n\"Pressure Blocking\" Effect in the Growing Vapor Bubble in a Highly Superheated Liquid\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZudin, Yu. B.; Zenin, V. V.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe problem on the growth of a vapor bubble in a liquid whose superheating enthalpy exceeds the phase transition heat has been considered. A physical model of the \"pressure blocking\" in the bubble is presented. The problem for the conditions of the experiment on the effervescence of a butane drop has been solved numerically. An algorithm for constructing an analytical solution of the problem on the bubble growth in a highly superheated liquid is proposed.\n\nMicrospectroscopic imaging of solution plasma: How do its physical properties and chemical species evolve in atmospheric-pressure water vapor bubbles?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYui, Hiroharu; Banno, Motohiro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this article, we review the development of scientific instruments for obtaining information on the evolution of physical properties and chemical species of solution plasma (SP). When a pulsed high voltage is applied between electrodes immersed in an aqueous solution, SP is formed in water vapor bubbles transiently generated in the solution under atmospheric pressure. To clarify how SP emerges in water vapor bubbles and is sustained in solutions, an instrument with micrometer spatial resolution and nanosecond temporal resolution is required. To meet these requirements, a microscopic system with a custom-made optical discharge cell was newly developed, where the working distance between the SP and the microscopic objective lens was minimized. A hollow electrode equipped in the discharge cell also enabled us to control the chemical composition in water vapor bubbles. To study the spatial and temporal evolutions of chemical species in micrometer and nano- to microsecond regions, a streak camera with a spectrometer and a CCD detector with a time-gated electronic device were combined with the microscope system. The developed instrument is expected to contribute to providing a new means of developing new schemes for chemical reactions and material syntheses.\n\nA Generalized Eulerian-Lagrangian Analysis, with Application to Liquid Flows with Vapor Bubbles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDejong, Frederik J.; Meyyappan, Meyya\n\n1993-01-01\n\nUnder a NASA MSFC SBIR Phase 2 effort an analysis has been developed for liquid flows with vapor bubbles such as those in liquid rocket engine components. The analysis is based on a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian technique, in which Eulerian conservation equations are solved for the liquid phase, while Lagrangian equations of motion are integrated in computational coordinates for the vapor phase. The novel aspect of the Lagrangian analysis developed under this effort is that it combines features of the so-called particle distribution approach with those of the so-called particle trajectory approach and can, in fact, be considered as a generalization of both of those traditional methods. The result of this generalization is a reduction in CPU time and memory requirements. Particle time step (stability) limitations have been eliminated by semi-implicit integration of the particle equations of motion (and, for certain applications, the particle temperature equation), although practical limitations remain in effect for reasons of accuracy. The analysis has been applied to the simulation of cavitating flow through a single-bladed section of a labyrinth seal. Models for the simulation of bubble formation and growth have been included, as well as models for bubble drag and heat transfer. The results indicate that bubble formation is more or less 'explosive'. for a given flow field, the number density of bubble nucleation sites is very sensitive to the vapor properties and the surface tension. The bubble motion, on the other hand, is much less sensitive to the properties, but is affected strongly by the local pressure gradients in the flow field. In situations where either the material properties or the flow field are not known with sufficient accuracy, parametric studies can be carried out rapidly to assess the effect of the important variables. Future work will include application of the analysis to cavitation in inducer flow fields.\n\nShock-wave generation and bubble formation in the retina by lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Jinming; Gerstman, Bernard S.; Li, Bin\n\n2000-06-01\n\nThe generation of shock waves and bubbles has been experimentally observed due to absorption of sub-nanosecond laser pulses by melanosomes, which are found in retinal pigment epithelium cells. Both the shock waves and bubbles may be the cause of retinal damage at threshold fluence levels. The theoretical modeling of shock wave parameters such as amplitude, and bubble size, is a complicated problem due to the non-linearity of the phenomena. We have used two different approaches for treating pressure variations in water: the Tait Equation and a full Equation Of State (EOS). The Tait Equation has the advantage of being developed specifically to model pressure variations in water and is therefore simpler, quicker computationally, and allows the liquid to sustain negative pressures. Its disadvantage is that it does not allow for a change of phase, which prevents modeling of bubbles and leads to non-physical behavior such as the sustaining of ridiculously large negative pressures. The full EOS treatment includes more of the true thermodynamic behavior, such as phase changes that produce bubbles and avoids the generation of large negative pressures. Its disadvantage is that the usual stable equilibrium EOS allows for no negative pressures at all, since tensile stress is unstable with respect to a transition to the vapor phase. In addition, the EOS treatment requires longer computational times. In this paper, we compare shock wave generation for various laser pulses using the two different mathematical approaches and determine the laser pulse regime for which the simpler Tait Equation can be used with confidence. We also present results of our full EOS treatment in which both shock waves and bubbles are simultaneously modeled.\n\nBubble colloidal AFM probes formed from ultrasonically generated bubbles.\n\nPubMed\n\nVakarelski, Ivan U; Lee, Judy; Dagastine, Raymond R; Chan, Derek Y C; Stevens, Geoffrey W; Grieser, Franz\n\n2008-02-05\n\nHere we introduce a simple and effective experimental approach to measuring the interaction forces between two small bubbles (approximately 80-140 microm) in aqueous solution during controlled collisions on the scale of micrometers to nanometers. The colloidal probe technique using atomic force microscopy (AFM) was extended to measure interaction forces between a cantilever-attached bubble and surface-attached bubbles of various sizes. By using an ultrasonic source, we generated numerous small bubbles on a mildly hydrophobic surface of a glass slide. A single bubble picked up with a strongly hydrophobized V-shaped cantilever was used as the colloidal probe. Sample force measurements were used to evaluate the pure water bubble cleanliness and the general consistency of the measurements.\n\nDetermination of the Accommodation Coefficient Using Vapor/gas Bubble Dynamics in an Acoustic Field\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGumerov, Nail A.; Hsiao, Chao-Tsung; Goumilevski, Alexei G.; Allen, Jeff (Technical Monitor)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nNonequilibrium liquid/vapor phase transformations can occur in superheated or subcooled liquids in fast processes such as in evaporation in a vacuum. The rate at which such a phase transformation occurs depends on the \"condensation\" or \"accommodation\" coefficient, Beta, which is a property of the interface. Existing measurement techniques for Beta are complex and expensive. The development of a relatively inexpensive and reliable technique for measurement of Beta for a wide range of substances and temperatures is of great practical importance. The dynamics of a bubble in an acoustic field strongly depends on the value of Beta. It is known that near the saturation temperature, small vapor bubbles grow under the action of an acoustic field due to \"rectified heat transfer.\" This finding can be used as the basis for an effective measurement technique of Beta. We developed a theory of vapor bubble behavior in an isotropic acoustic wave and in a plane standing acoustic wave. A numerical code was developed which enables simulation of a variety of experimental situations and accurately takes into account slowly evolving temperature. A parametric study showed that the measurement of Beta can be made over a broad range of frequencies and bubble sizes. We found several interesting regimes and conditions which can be efficiently used for measurements of Beta. Measurements of Beta can be performed in both reduced and normal gravity environments.\n\nThe dynamics of histotripsy bubbles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKreider, Wayne; Bailey, Michael R.; Sapozhnikov, Oleg A.; Khokhlova, Vera A.; Crum, Lawrence A.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nHistotripsy describes treatments in which high-amplitude acoustic pulses are used to excite bubbles and erode tissue. Though tissue erosion can be directly attributed to bubble activity, the genesis and dynamics of bubbles remain unclear. Histotripsy lesions that show no signs of thermal coagulative damage have been generated with two different acoustic protocols: relatively long acoustic pulses that produce local boiling within milliseconds and relatively short pulses that are higher in amplitude but likely do not produce boiling. While these two approaches are often distinguished as `boiling' versus `cavitation', such labels can obscure similarities. In both cases, a bubble undergoes large changes in radius and vapor is transported into and out of the bubble as it oscillates. Moreover, observations from both approaches suggest that bubbles grow to a size at which they cease to collapse violently. In order to better understand the dynamics of histotripsy bubbles, a single-bubble model has been developed that couples acoustically excited bubble motions to the thermodynamic state of the surrounding liquid. Using this model for bubbles exposed to histotripsy sound fields, simulations suggest that two mechanisms can act separately or in concert to lead to the typically observed bubble growth. First, nonlinear acoustic propagation leads to the evolution of shocks and an asymmetry in the positive and negative pressures that drive bubble motion. This asymmetry can have a rectifying effect on bubble oscillations whereby the bubble grows on average during each acoustic cycle. Second, vapor transport to/from the bubble tends to produce larger bubbles, especially at elevated temperatures. Vapor transport by itself can lead to rectified bubble growth when the ambient temperature exceeds 100 Â°C (`boiling') or local heating in the vicinity of the bubble leads to a superheated boundary layer.\n\nNear Surface Vapor Bubble Layers in Buoyant Low Stretch Burning of Polymethylmethacrylate\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOlson, Sandra L.; Tien, J. S.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nLarge-scale buoyant low stretch stagnation point diffusion flames over solid fuel (polymethylmethacrylate) were studied for a range of aerodynamic stretch rates of 2-12/ sec which are of the same order as spacecraft ventilation-induced stretch in a microgravity environment. An extensive layer of polymer material above the glass transition temperature is observed. Unique phenomena associated with this extensive glass layer included substantial swelling of the burning surface, in-depth bubble formation, and migration and/or elongation of the bubbles normal to the hot surface. The bubble layer acted to insulate the polymer surface by reducing the effective conductivity of the solid. The reduced in-depth conduction stabilized the flame for longer than expected from theory neglecting the bubble layer. While buoyancy acts to move the bubbles deeper into the molten polymer, thermocapillary forces and surface regression both act to bring the bubbles to the burning surface. Bubble layers may thus be very important in low gravity (low stretch) burning of materials. As bubbles reached the burning surface, monomer fuel vapors jetted from the surface, enhancing burning by entraining ambient air flow. Popping of these bubbles at the surface can expel burning droplets of the molten material, which may increase the fire propagation hazards at low stretch rates.\n\nSystems and methods for generation of hydrogen peroxide vapor\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLove, Adam H; Eckels, Joel Del; Vu, Alexander K; Alcaraz, Armando; Reynolds, John G\n\n2014-12-02\n\nA system according to one embodiment includes a moisture trap for drying air; at least one of a first container and a second container; and a mechanism for at least one of: bubbling dried air from the moisture trap through a hydrogen peroxide solution in the first container for producing a hydrogen peroxide vapor, and passing dried air from the moisture trap into a headspace above a hydrogen peroxide solution in the second container for producing a hydrogen peroxide vapor. A method according one embodiment includes at least one of bubbling dried air through a hydrogen peroxide solution in a container for producing a first hydrogen peroxide vapor, and passing dried air from the moisture trap into a headspace above the hydrogen peroxide solution in a container for producing a second hydrogen peroxide vapor. Additional systems and methods are also presented.\n\nVapor-Gas Bubble Evolution and Growth in Extremely Viscous Fluids Under Vacuum\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKizito, John; Balasubramaniam, R.; Nahra, Henry; Agui, Juan; Truong, Duc\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFormation of vapor and gas bubbles and voids is normal and expected in flow processes involving extremely viscous fluids in normal gravity. Practical examples of extremely viscous fluids are epoxy-like filler materials before the epoxy fluids cure to their permanent form to create a mechanical bond between two substrates. When these fluids flow with a free liquid interface exposed to vacuum, rapid bubble expansion process may ensue. Bubble expansion might compromise the mechanical bond strength. The potential sources for the origin of the gases might be incomplete out-gassing process prior to filler application; regasification due to seal leakage in the filler applicator; and/or volatiles evolved from cure reaction products formed in the hardening process. We embarked on a study that involved conducting laboratory experiments with imaging diagnostics in order to deduce the seriousness of bubbling caused by entrained air and volatile fluids under space vacuum and low gravity environment. We used clear fluids with the similar physical properties as the epoxy-like filler material to mimic the dynamics of bubbles. Another aspect of the present study was to determine the likelihood of bubbling resulting from dissolved gases nucleating from solution. These experimental studies of the bubble expansion are compared with predictions using a modified Rayleigh- Plesset equation, which models the bubble expansion.\n\nSegregating gas from melt: an experimental study of the Ostwald ripening of vapor bubbles in magmas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLautze, Nicole C.; Sisson, Thomas W.; Mangan, Margaret T.; Grove, Timothy L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDiffusive coarsening (Ostwald ripening) of H2O and H2O-CO2 bubbles in rhyolite and basaltic andesite melts was studied with elevated temperatureâpressure experiments to investigate the rates and time spans over which vapor bubbles may enlarge and attain sufficient buoyancy to segregate in magmatic systems. Bubble growth and segregation are also considered in terms of classical steady-state and transient (non-steady-state) ripening theory. Experimental results are consistent with diffusive coarsening as the dominant mechanism of bubble growth. Ripening is faster in experiments saturated with pure H2O than in those with a CO2-rich mixed vapor probably due to faster diffusion of H2O than CO2 through the melt. None of the experimental series followed the time1/3 increase in mean bubble radius and time-1 decrease in bubble number density predicted by classical steady-state ripening theory. Instead, products are interpreted as resulting from transient regime ripening. Application of transient regime theory suggests that bubbly magmas may require from days to 100 years to reach steady-state ripening conditions. Experimental results, as well as theory for steady-state ripening of bubbles that are immobile or undergoing buoyant ascent, indicate that diffusive coarsening efficiently eliminates micron-sized bubbles and would produce mm-sized bubbles in 102â104 years in crustal magma bodies. Once bubbles attain mm-sizes, their calculated ascent rates are sufficient that they could transit multiple kilometers over hundreds to thousands of years through mafic and silicic melt, respectively. These results show that diffusive coarsening can facilitate transfer of volatiles through, and from, magmatic systems by creating bubbles sufficiently large for rapid ascent.\n\nLaser-induced microjet: wavelength and pulse duration effects on bubble and jet generation for drug injection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJang, Hun-jae; Park, Mi-ae; Sirotkin, Fedir V.; Yoh, Jack J.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe expansion of the laser-induced bubble is the main mechanism in the developed microjet injector. In this study, Nd:YAG and Er:YAG lasers are used as triggers of the bubble formation. The impact of the laser parameters on the bubble dynamics is studied and the performance of the injector is evaluated. We found that the main cause of the differences in the bubble behavior comes from the pulse duration and wavelength. For Nd:YAG laser, the pulse duration is very short relative to the bubble lifetime making the behavior of the bubble close to that of the cavitation bubble, while in Er:YAG case, the high absorption in the water and long pulse duration change the initial behavior of the bubble making it close to a vapor bubble. The contraction and subsequent rebound are typical for cavitation bubbles in both cases. The results show that the laser-induced microjet injector generates velocity which is sufficient for the drug delivery for both laser beams of different pulse duration. We estimate the typical velocity within 30-80 m/s range and the breakup length to be larger than 1 mm suitable for trans-dermal drug injection.\n\nCharacterization of Acoustic Droplet Vaporization Using MRI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, David; Allen, Steven; Hernandez-Garcia, Luis; Bull, Joseph\n\n2013-11-01\n\nAcoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) is the selective vaporization of liquid droplets to form larger gas bubbles. The ADV process is currently being researched for biomedical applications such as gas embolotherapy, drug delivery, and phase-change contrast agents. In this study an albumin encapsulated dodecafluoropentane (DDFP, CAS: 678-26-2) microdroplet suspension was vaporized using a single element focused (f/2, D = 19 mm) 3.5 MHz transducer (Panametrics A321S, Olympus, Waltham, MA). The resulting DDFP bubble clouds were imaged using both bright field microscopy and MRI (Varian 7T, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Field distortions due to DDFP bubble generation were characterized against the bright field images as a function of acoustic power and bubble cloud size. Experimentally a direct correlation between bubble cloud dimensions generated and field distortions seen in the MRI was observed. Additionally, MR velocimetry was used to measure the flow field resulting from ADV. The field distortions due to the bubbles were further characterized by modeling Maxwell's equations using COMSOL (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA). The ability to characterize ADV with alternative imaging modalities may prove useful in further development of ADV based biomedical therapies.\n\nObservation of vapor bubble of non-azeotropic binary mixture in microgravity with a two-wavelength interferometer\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbe, Yoshiyuki; Iwasaki, Akira\n\n1999-07-01\n\nAlthough non-azeotropic mixtures are considered to be promising working fluids in advanced energy conversion systems, the primary technical problems in the heat transfer degradation in phase change processes cause economical handicap to wide-spread applications. The boiling behavior of mixtures still remains a number of basic questions being not answered yet, and the present authors believe that the most essential information for the boiling process in non-azeotropic mixtures is how temperature and concentration profiles are developed around the bubbles. The present study attempts at understanding fundamental heat and mass transfer mechanisms in nucleate pool boiling of non-azeotropic binary mixtures, and withmoreÂ Â» the knowledge to develop a passive boiling heat transfer enhancement eventually. To this end, the authors have employed microgravity environment for rather detailed observation around vapor bubbles in the course of boiling inception and bubble growth. A two-wavelength Mach-Zehnder interferometer has been developed, which withstands mechanical shock caused by gravity change from very low gravity of the order of 10{sup {minus}5} g to relatively high gravity of approximately 8 g exposed during deceleration period. A series of experiments on single vapor bubbles for CFC113 single component and CFC12/CFC112 non-azeotropic binary mixture have been conducted under a high quality microgravity conditions available in 10-second free-fall facility of Japan Microgravity Center (JAMIC). The results for single component liquid showed a strong influence due to Marangoni effect caused by the temperature profile around the bubble. The results for non-azeotropic binary mixture showed, however, considerably different behavior from single component liquid. Both temperature and concentration profiles around a single vapor bubble were evaluated from the interferograms. The temperature and concentration layers established around the bubbles were nearly one order of\n\nCVB: The Constrained Vapor Bubble 40 mm Capillary Experiment on the ISS\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWayner, Peter C., Jr.; Kundan, Akshay; Plawsky, Joel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDiscuss the Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) 40mm Fin experiment on the ISS and how it aims to achieve a better understanding of the physics of evaporation and condensation and how they affect cooling processes in microgravity using a remotely controlled microscope and a small cooling device\n\nEffect of metabolic gases and water vapor, perfluorocarbon emulsions, and nitric oxide on tissue bubbles during decompression sickness.\n\nPubMed\n\nRandsÃ¸e, Thomas\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn aviation and diving, fast decrease in ambient pressure, such as during accidental loss of cabin pressure or when a diver decompresses too fast to sea level, may cause nitrogen (N2) bubble formation in blood and tissue resulting in decompression sickness (DCS). Conventional treatment of DCS is oxygen (O2) breathing combined with recompression.Â However, bubble kinetic models suggest, that metabolic gases, i.e. O2 and carbon dioxide (CO2), and water vapor contribute significantly to DCS bubble volume and growth at hypobaric altitude exposures. Further, perfluorocarbon emulsions (PFC) and nitric oxide (NO) donors have, on an experimental basis, demonstrated therapeutic properties both as treatment and prophylactic intervention against DCS. The effect was ascribed to solubility of respiratory gases in PFC, plausible NO elicited nuclei demise and/or N2 washout through enhanced blood flow rate. Accordingly, by means of monitoring injected bubbles in exposed adipose tissue or measurements of spinal evoked potentials (SEPs) in anaesthetized rats, the aim of this study was to: 1) evaluate the contribution of metabolic gases and water vapor to bubble volume at different barometrical altitude exposures, 2) clarify the O2 contribution and N2 solubility from bubbles during administration of PFC at normo- and hypobaric conditions and, 3) test the effect of different NO donors on SEPs during DCS upon a hyperbaric air dive and, to study the influence ofÂ NO on tissue bubbles at high altitude exposures. The results support the bubble kinetic models and indicate that metabolic gases and water vapor contribute significantly to bubble volume at 25 kPa (~10,376 m above sea level) and constitute a threshold for bubble stabilization or decay at the interval of 47-36 kPa (~6,036 and ~7,920 m above sea level). The effect of the metabolic gases and water vapor seemed to compromise the therapeutic properties of both PFC and NO at altitude, while PFC significantly increased bubble\n\nBubble diagnostics\n\nDOEpatents\n\nVisuri, Steven R.; Mammini, Beth M.; Da Silva, Luiz B.; Celliers, Peter M.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe present invention is intended as a means of diagnosing the presence of a gas bubble and incorporating the information into a feedback system for opto-acoustic thrombolysis. In opto-acoustic thrombolysis, pulsed laser radiation at ultrasonic frequencies is delivered intraluminally down an optical fiber and directed toward a thrombus or otherwise occluded vessel. Dissolution of the occlusion is therefore mediated through ultrasonic action of propagating pressure or shock waves. A vapor bubble in the fluid surrounding the occlusion may form as a result of laser irradiation. This vapor bubble may be used to directly disrupt the occlusion or as a means of producing a pressure wave. It is desirable to detect the formation and follow the lifetime of the vapor bubble. Knowledge of the bubble formation and lifetime yields critical information as to the maximum size of the bubble, density of the absorbed radiation, and properties of the absorbing material. This information can then be used in a feedback system to alter the irradiation conditions.\n\nNet vapor generation point in boiling flow of trichlorotrifluoroethane at high pressures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDougall, R. S.; Lippert, T. E.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe conditions at which the void in subcooled boiling starts to undergo a rapid increase were studied experimentally. The experiments were performed in a 12.7 x 9.5 mm rectangular channel. Heating was from a 3.2 mm wide strip embedded in one wall. The pressure ranged from 9.45 to 20.7 bar, mass velocity from 600 to 7000 kg/sq m sec, and subcooling from 16 to 67 C. Photographs were used to determine when detached bubbles first appeared in the bulk flow. Measurements of bubble layer thickness along the wall were also made. Results showed that the point of net vapor generation is close to the occurrence of fully-developed boiling.\n\nCalibrated vapor generator source\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDavies, John P.; Larson, Ronald A.; Goodrich, Lorenzo D.; Hall, Harold J.; Stoddard, Billy D.; Davis, Sean G.; Kaser, Timothy G.; Conrad, Frank J.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA portable vapor generator is disclosed that can provide a controlled source of chemical vapors, such as, narcotic or explosive vapors.

A controlled flow of air is pulsed over the quartz wool releasing a preset quantity of vapors at the outlet. 10 figs.\n\nFurther experimentation on bubble generation during transformer overload\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOommen, T.V.\n\n1992-03-01\n\nThis report covers additional work done during 1990 and 1991 on gas bubble generation under overload conditions. To improve visual bubble detection, a single disc coil was used. To further improve detection, a corona device was also used which signaled the onset of corona activity in the early stages of bubble formation. A total of fourteen model tests were conducted, half of which used the Inertaire system, and the remaining, a conservator (COPS). Moisture content of paper in the coil varied from 1.0% to 8.0%; gas (nitrogen) content varied from 1.0% to 8.8%. The results confirmed earlier observations that themoreÂ Â» mathematical bubble prediction model was not valid for high gas content model with relatively low moisture levels in the coil. An empirical relationship was formulated to accurately predict bubble evolution temperatures from known moisture and gas content values. For low moisture content models (below 2%), the simple Piper relationship was sufficient to predict bubble evolution temperatures, regardless of gas content. Moisture in the coil appears to be the key factor in bubble generation. Gas blanketed (Inertaire) systems do not appear to be prone to premature bubble generation from overloads as previously thought. The new bubble prediction model reveals that for a coil with 2% moisture, the bubble evolution temperature would be about 140{degrees}C. Since old transformers in service may have as much as 2% moisture in paper, the 140{degrees}C bubble evolution temperature may be taken as the lower limit of bubble evolution temperature under overload conditions for operating transformers. Drier insulation would raise the bubble evolution temperature.Â«Â less\n\nBubble Combustion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCorrigan, Jackie\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA method of energy production that is capable of low pollutant emissions is fundamental to one of the four pillars of NASA s Aeronautics Blueprint: Revolutionary Vehicles. Bubble combustion, a new engine technology currently being developed at Glenn Research Center promises to provide low emissions combustion in support of NASA s vision under the Emissions Element because it generates power, while minimizing the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxides (NOx), both known to be Greenhouse gases. and allows the use of alternative fuels such as corn oil, low-grade fuels, and even used motor oil. Bubble combustion is analogous to the inverse of spray combustion: the difference between bubble and spray combustion is that spray combustion is spraying a liquid in to a gas to form droplets, whereas bubble combustion involves injecting a gas into a liquid to form gaseous bubbles. In bubble combustion, the process for the ignition of the bubbles takes place on a time scale of less than a nanosecond and begins with acoustic waves perturbing each bubble. This perturbation causes the local pressure to drop below the vapor pressure of the liquid thus producing cavitation in which the bubble diameter grows, and upon reversal of the oscillating pressure field, the bubble then collapses rapidly with the aid of the high surface tension forces acting on the wall of the bubble. The rapid and violent collapse causes the temperatures inside the bubbles to soar as a result of adiabatic heating. As the temperatures rise, the gaseous contents of the bubble ignite with the bubble itself serving as its own combustion chamber. After ignition, this is the time in the bubble s life cycle where power is generated, and CO2, and NOx among other species, are produced. However, the pollutants CO2 and NOx are absorbed into the surrounding liquid. The importance of bubble combustion is that it generates power using a simple and compact device. We conducted a parametric study using CAVCHEM\n\nThulium fiber laser induced vapor bubbles using bare, tapered, ball, hollow steel, and muzzle brake fiber optic tips\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzalez, David A.; Hardy, Luke A.; Hutchens, Thomas C.; Irby, Pierce B.; Fried, Nathaniel M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis study characterizes laser-induced vapor bubbles for five distal fiber optic tip configurations, to provide insight into stone retropulsion experienced during laser ablation of kidney stones. A TFL with 1908-nm wavelength delivered 34 mJ energy per pulse at 500-Î¼s pulse duration through five different fibers: 100-Î¼m-core/170-Î¼m-OD bare fiber tip, 150-Î¼m- to 300-Î¼m-core tapered fiber tip, 100-Î¼m-core/300-Î¼m-OD ball tip fiber, 100-Î¼m-core/340- Î¼m-OD hollow steel tip fiber, and 100-Î¼m-core/560-Î¼m-OD muzzle brake fiber tip. A high speed camera with 10- Î¼m spatial and 9.5-Î¼s temporal resolution imaged vapor bubble dynamics. A needle hydrophone measured pressure transients in forward (0Â°) and side (90Â°) directions while placed at a 6.8 +/- 0.4 mm distance from fiber tip. Maximum bubble dimensions (width/length) averaged 0.7/1.5, 1.0/1.6, 0.5/1.1, 0.8/1.9, and 0.7/1.5 mm, for bare, tapered, ball, hollow steel, and muzzle tips, respectively (n=5). The hollow steel tip exhibited the most elongated vapor bubble shape, translating into increased forward pressure in this study and consistent with higher stone retropulsion in previous reports. Relative pressures (a.u.) in (forward/side) directions averaged 1.7/1.6, 2.0/2.0, 1.4/1.2, 6.8/1.1, and 0.3/1.2, for each fiber tip (n=5). For hollow steel tip, forward pressure was 4Ã higher than for bare fiber. For the muzzle brake fiber tip, forward pressure was 5Ã lower than for bare fiber. Bubble dimensions and pressure measurements demonstrated that the muzzle tip reduced forward pressure by partially venting vapors through side holes, consistent with lower stone retropulsion observed in previous reports.\n\nSize distributions of micro-bubbles generated by a pressurized dissolution method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaya, C.; Maeda, Y.; Hosokawa, S.; Tomiyama, A.; Ito, Y.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nSize of micro-bubbles is widely distributed in the range of one to several hundreds micrometers and depends on generation methods, flow conditions and elapsed times after the bubble generation. Although a size distribution of micro-bubbles should be taken into account to improve accuracy in numerical simulations of flows with micro-bubbles, a variety of the size distribution makes it difficult to introduce the size distribution in the simulations. On the other hand, several models such as the Rosin-Rammler equation and the Nukiyama-Tanazawa equation have been proposed to represent the size distribution of particles or droplets. Applicability of these models to the size distribution of micro-bubbles has not been examined yet. In this study, we therefore measure size distribution of micro-bubbles generated by a pressurized dissolution method by using a phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), and investigate the applicability of the available models to the size distributions of micro-bubbles. Experimental apparatus consists of a pressurized tank in which air is dissolved in liquid under high pressure condition, a decompression nozzle in which micro-bubbles are generated due to pressure reduction, a rectangular duct and an upper tank. Experiments are conducted for several liquid volumetric fluxes in the decompression nozzle. Measurements are carried out at the downstream region of the decompression nozzle and in the upper tank. The experimental results indicate that (1) the Nukiyama-Tanasawa equation well represents the size distribution of micro-bubbles generated by the pressurized dissolution method, whereas the Rosin-Rammler equation fails in the representation, (2) the bubble size distribution of micro-bubbles can be evaluated by using the Nukiyama-Tanasawa equation without individual bubble diameters, when mean bubble diameter and skewness of the bubble distribution are given, and (3) an evaluation method of visibility based on the bubble size distribution and bubble\n\nThulium fiber laser-induced vapor bubble dynamics using bare, tapered, ball, hollow steel, and muzzle brake fiber optic tips\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGonzalez, David A.; Hardy, Luke A.; Hutchens, Thomas C.; Irby, Pierce B.; Fried, Nathaniel M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis study characterizes laser-induced vapor bubble dynamics for five different distal fiber optic tip configurations, to provide insight into stone retropulsion commonly experienced during laser ablation of kidney stones.

L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe objective of this effort is to better understand the physics of evaporation, condensation, and fluid flow as they affect the heat transfer processes in a constrained vapor bubble heat exchanger (CVBHX). This CVBHX consists of a small enclosed container with a square cross section (inside dimensions. 3 x 3 x 40 mm) partially filled with a liquid. The major portion of the liquid is in the corners, which act as arteries. When a temperature difference is applied to the ends of the CVBHX, evaporation occurs at the hot end and condensation at the cold end resulting in a very effective heat transfer device with great potential in space applications. Liquid is returned by capillary flow in the corners. A complete description of the system and the results obtained to date are given in the papers listed.\n\nExperimental study of flash boiling spray vaporization through quantitative vapor concentration and liquid temperature measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Gaoming; Hung, David L. S.; Xu, Min\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFlash boiling sprays of liquid injection under superheated conditions provide the novel solutions of fast vaporization and better air-fuel mixture formation for internal combustion engines. However, the physical mechanisms of flash boiling spray vaporization are more complicated than the droplet surface vaporization due to the unique bubble generation and boiling process inside a superheated bulk liquid, which are not well understood. In this study, the vaporization of flash boiling sprays was investigated experimentally through the quantitative measurements of vapor concentration and liquid temperature. Specifically, the laser-induced exciplex fluorescence technique was applied to distinguish the liquid and vapor distributions. Quantitative vapor concentration was obtained by correlating the intensity of vapor-phase fluorescence with vapor concentration through systematic corrections and calibrations. The intensities of two wavelengths were captured simultaneously from the liquid-phase fluorescence spectra, and their intensity ratios were correlated with liquid temperature. The results show that both liquid and vapor phase of multi-hole sprays collapse toward the centerline of the spray with different mass distributions under the flash boiling conditions. Large amount of vapor aggregates along the centerline of the spray to form a \"gas jet\" structure, whereas the liquid distributes more uniformly with large vortexes formed in the vicinity of the spray tip. The vaporization process under the flash boiling condition is greatly enhanced due to the intense bubble generation and burst. The liquid temperature measurements show strong temperature variations inside the flash boiling sprays with hot zones present in the \"gas jet\" structure and vortex region. In addition, high vapor concentration and closed vortex motion seem to have inhibited the heat and mass transfer in these regions. In summary, the vapor concentration and liquid temperature provide detailed information\n\nControl of flow through a vapor generator\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRadcliff, Thomas D.\n\n2005-11-08\n\nIn a Rankine cycle system wherein a vapor generator receives heat from exhaust gases, provision is made to avoid overheating of the refrigerant during ORC system shut down while at the same time preventing condensation of those gases within the vapor generator when its temperature drops below a threshold temperature by diverting the flow of hot gases to ambient and to thereby draw ambient air through the vapor generator in the process. In one embodiment, a bistable ejector is adjustable between one position, in which the hot gases flow through the vapor generator, to another position wherein the gases are diverted away from the vapor generator. Another embodiment provides for a fixed valve ejector with a bias towards discharging to ambient, but with a fan on the downstream side of said vapor generator for overcoming this bias.\n\nGas embolotherapy: Bubble evolution in acoustic droplet vaporization and design of a benchtop microvascular model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWong, Zheng Zheng\n\nThis work was motivated by an ongoing development of a potential embolotherapy technique to occlude blood flow to tumors using gas bubbles selectively formed by in vivo acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) of liquid perfluorocarbon droplets. Mechanisms behind the ADV, transport and lodging of emboli need to be understood before gas embolotherapy can translate to the clinic. Evolution of a bubble from acoustic droplet vaporization in a rigid tube, under physiological and room temperature conditions, was observed via ultra-high speed imaging. Effective radii and radial expansion ratios were obtained by processing the images using Image] software. At physiological temperature, a radial expansion ratio of 5.05 was attained, consistent with theoretical prediction. The initial radial growth rate was linear, after which the growth rate increased proportionally with square root of time. Nondimensionalization revealed that the subsequent growth rate also varied inversely with square root of initial radius. Eventually growth became asymptotic. No collapse was observed. A theoretical model derived from a modified Bernoulli equation, and a computational model by Ye & Bull (2004), were compared respectively with experimental results. Initial growth rates were predicted correctly by both models. Experimental results showed heavy damping of growth rate as the bubble grew towards the wall, whereas both models predicted an overshoot in growth followed by multiple oscillations. The theoretical model broke down near the wall; the computational model gave a reasonable bubble shape near the wall but would require correct initial pressure values to be accurate. At room temperature, the expansion ratio shot to 1.43 initially and oscillated down to 1.11, far below the theoretical prediction. Failure of the bubble to expand fully could be due to unconsumed or condensed liquid perfluorocarbon. A new fabrication method via non-lithographic means was devised to make a circular\n\nGeneration of Submicron Bubbles using Venturi Tube Method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWiraputra, I. G. P. A. E.; Edikresnha, D.; Munir, M. M.; Khairurrijal\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn this experiment, submicron bubbles that have diameters less than 1 millimeter were generated by mixing water and gas by hydrodynamic cavitation method. The water was forced to pass through a venturi tube in which the speed of the water will increase in the narrow section, the throat, of the venturi. When the speed of water increased, the pressure would drop at the throat of the venturi causing the outside air to be absorbed via the gas inlet. The gas was then trapped inside the water producing bubbles. The effects of several physical parameters on the characteristics of the bubbles will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. It was found that larger amount of gas pressure during compression will increase the production rate of bubbles and increase the density of bubble within water.\n\nBubble Generation in a Continuous Liquid Flow Under Reduced Gravity Conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPais, Salvatore Cezar\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe present work reports a study of bubble generation under reduced gravity conditions for both co-flow and cross-flow configurations. Experiments were performed aboard the DC-9 Reduced Gravity Aircraft at NASA Glenn Research Center, using an air-water system. Three different flow tube diameters were used: 1.27, 1.9, and 2.54 cm. Two different ratios of air injection nozzle to tube diameters were considered: 0.1 and 0.2. Gas and liquid volumetric flow rates were varied from 10 to 200 ml/s. It was experimentally observed that with increasing superficial liquid velocity, the bubbles generated decreased in size. The bubble diameter was shown to increase with increasing air injection nozzle diameters. As the tube diameter was increased, the size of the detached bubbles increased. Likewise, as the superficial liquid velocity was increased, the frequency of bubble formation increased and thus the time to detach forming bubbles decreased. Independent of the flow configuration (for either single nozzle or multiple nozzle gas injection), void fraction and hence flow regime transition can be controlled in a somewhat precise manner by solely varying the gas and liquid volumetric flow rates. On the other hand, it is observed that uniformity of bubble size can be controlled more accurately by using single nozzle gas injection than by using multiple port injection, since this latter system gives rise to unpredictable coalescence of adjacent bubbles. A theoretical model, based on an overall force balance, is employed to study single bubble generation in the dynamic and bubbly flow regime. Under conditions of reduced gravity, the gas momentum flux enhances bubble detachment; however, the surface tension forces at the nozzle tip inhibits bubble detachment. Liquid drag and inertia can act either as attaching or detaching force, depending on the relative velocity of the bubble with respect to the surrounding liquid. Predictions of the theoretical model compare well with performed\n\nSurfactants for Bubble Removal against Buoyancy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRaza, Md. Qaisar; Kumar, Nirbhay; Raj, Rishi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe common phenomenon of buoyancy-induced vapor bubble lift-off from a heated surface is of importance to many areas of science and technology. In the absence of buoyancy in zero gravity of space, non-departing bubbles coalesce to form a big dry patch on the heated surface and heat transfer deteriorates despite the high latent heat of vaporization of water. The situation is worse on an inverted heater in earth gravity where both buoyancy and surface tension act upwards to oppose bubble removal. Here we report a robust passive technique which uses surfactants found in common soaps and detergents to avoid coalescence and remove bubbles downwards, away from an inverted heater. A force balance model is developed to demonstrate that the force of repulsion resulting from the interaction of surfactants adsorbed at the neighboring liquid-vapor interfaces of the thin liquid film contained between bubbles is strong enough to overcome buoyancy and surface tension. Bubble removal frequencies in excess of ten Hz resulted in more than twofold enhancement in heat transfer in comparison to pure water. We believe that this novel bubble removal mechanism opens up opportunities for designing boiling-based systems for space applications.\n\nSurfactants for Bubble Removal against Buoyancy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRaza, Md.

A classic example is the collapse of a bubble near a solid wall, where a fast jet is created towards the wall. The addition of a second wall creates a non-axisymmetric flow field, which influences the displacement and jet formation during the collapse of a bubble. In this experimental study we generate mm-sized vapor bubbles using a focused pulsed laser, giving us full control over the position of the bubble. The corner geometry is formed by two glass slides. High-speed imaging reveals the directional motion of the bubble during the collapse. We find that the bubble displacement cannot be fully described by a simple superposition of the bubble dynamics of the two walls individually. Comparison of our experimental results to a model based on potential flow shows a good agreement for the direction of displacement.\n\nWalks of bubbles on a hot wire in a liquid bath\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuchesne, A.; Caps, H.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWhen a horizontal resistive wire is heated up to the boiling point in a subcooled liquid bath, some vapor bubbles nucleate on its surface. The traditional nucleate boiling theory predicts that bubbles generated from active nucleate sites grow up and depart from the heating surface due to buoyancy and inertia. However, we observed here a different behavior: the bubbles slide along the heated wire. In this situation, unexpected regimes are observed; from the simple sliding motion to bubble clustering. We noticed that bubbles could rapidly change their moving direction and may also interact. Finally, we propose an interpretation for both the attraction between the bubbles and the wire and for the motion of the bubbles on the wire in terms of Marangoni effects.\n\nExpanding Taylor bubble under constant heat flux\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVoirand, Antoine; Benselama, Adel M.; Ayel, Vincent; Bertin, Yves\n\n2016-09-01\n\nModelization of non-isothermal bubbles expanding in a capillary, as a contribution to the understanding of the physical phenomena taking place in Pulsating Heat Pipes (PHPs), is the scope of this paper.
