Al Jefferson is officially done as an NBA player.

The former Boston Celtics power forward confirmed his retirement from the NBA to the Boston Globe's Gary Washburn on Saturday.

Jefferson last played 36 games for the Indiana Pacers during the 2017-18 season. He did not make an appearance this season.

The 34-year-old veteran played for five different teams over 14 seasons. He was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 15th pick in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft. Jefferson immediately became the building block of the Celtics' rebuild alongside veteran Paul Pierce.

Jefferson's ascent to one of the premier young big men in the league helped the Celtics acquire future Hall of Fame forward Kevin Garnett in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2007. Jefferson was the prized piece of the Wolves' return for Garnett, and without the young star, the C's might not have been able to pull off the deal. That trade arguably was the primary reason why C's won the 2008 NBA Finals as Garnett changed the culture in Boston, won 2008 Defensive Player of the Year and was a nightmare for opponents on offense.

So, as Jefferson transitions from NBA retirement to a new career in the "Big 3", Celtics fans should always appreciate him for helping the franchise reach its ultimate goal after a 22-year drought.
