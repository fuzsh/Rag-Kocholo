BOSTON - Al Jefferson spent the first three years of his career with the Boston Celtics before he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the deal that brought Kevin Garnett to Boston and ultimately led to a Celtics championship.

Jefferson returned to TD Garden once again on Wednesday, but the result wasn't any different than other times he has returned to Beantown as a member of another team. Another game, another loss. Nevertheless, he was happy to be back.

"It's always good coming back here," said Jefferson, who had 18 points and 12 rebounds in the Utah Jazz' 94-82 loss. "It'd be nice to get a win. I haven't beaten them since I left. But it's always good to come back. They always play their best. We put ourselves in a position to win. That's all we can ask for."

Jefferson got into a little spat with the man he was traded for, Garnett, in the second half. The two got mixed up after the whistle and both received double technicals. Big Al knew who he was up against, though, and wasn't surprised in the least by the altercation.

"That's just him being himThat's all I've got to say about that."

Jefferson is averaging 19.3 points and 9.4 rebounds in 46 games in Utah this season.
