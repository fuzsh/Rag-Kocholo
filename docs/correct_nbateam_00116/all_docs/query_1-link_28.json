        "text": "Things were similarly euphoric in the local pro basketball community for 30 years. The Celtics won 11 championships in the Bill Russell era from 1957-69. There was a brief period of entrenchment before the Green and White won additional championships in 1974 and 1976, with a memorable 68-win season (1972-73) thrown in. If your dad, grandpop or Uncle Charlie tell you the Celtics would have defeated the Knicks, and absolutely would have annihilated the Lakers in the 1973 Finals, had John Havlicek not sustained a serious right shoulder injury, they know whereof they speak. But coulda/shoulda/wouldas are part of every team’s saga in every sport, and the Celtics have had their share of beneficial adverse circumstances plague their foes over the years.\n\nThe next championship gap was only five years. The Bird-McHale-Parish partnership produced championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, along with trips to the Finals and losses to the Lakers in 1985 and 1987. But from 1988 on it was always a matter of health with Larry, and that bunch never seriously threatened again. Larry retired in 1992. Kevin retired in 1993. Robert hung on here till 1994, before extending his career till age 43 in Chicago.\n\nAnd then came the Dark Ages.\n\nThe great what-ifs were the sad stories of Len Bias and Reggie Lewis. The Celtics appeared to be in an unimaginably delectable position for less than 24 hours in 1986. They were coming off a 16th championship (with Bird submitting one of his extraordinary masterpiece performances against Houston in Game 6) and here they were sitting on the No. 2 pick in the draft thanks to a sagacious deal Jan Volk had made with Seattle, trading Gerald Henderson for Seattle’s first-round pick. How good was Len Bias? All I can tell you is that I think he would have been a James Worthy-level perennial All Star; that is to say, not Larry, Magic or Michael, but a star on the level just below. And I can tell you that on two separate occasions Mike Krzyzewski has told me that the two toughest foes in his Duke coaching career were Michael Jordan and Len Bias. But, of course, you all know what happened to Bias. What we don’t know is how the Celtics would have handled the ongoing front court long-range situation with Bias involved. Oh, and one other thing: The Celtics may very well have defeated the Lakers in the 1987 Finals with the addition of one more quality player. So, there you go . . .\n\nAs for Reggie Lewis, when he died he was already an All Star and was entering his prime. The Celtics’ descent into 15-67 might never — make that would not — have happened.\n\nThe next wait was 22 years. Danny Ainge gets full credit for this one. He traded for Ray Allen and was able to obtain a reluctant Kevin Garnett because he had a tradeable asset in Al Jefferson. He then ably augmented his new Big Three (with Paul Pierce) with important auxiliary pieces such as Eddie House, James Posey, and P.J. Brown. I am forever on record as pooh-poohing the idea of that bunch being a championship team when it was first assembled. Sometimes it is very pleasant to be wrong.\n\nThat was a fast decade ago. Don’t lie. You can’t believe it’s 10 years already, either.\n\nThat 2008 title was a championship for a generation or two that had never seen Bird play, let alone Havlicek or Russell. Now there is a new crop for a clientele for whom Antoine Walker may be an abstract concept. And an interesting bunch it is.\n\nThe 2018-19 Celtics are an intriguing collection of seasoned veterans (Al Horford and Aron Baynes, each 32 this year), two midlife guys — one a star (28-year-old Gordon Hayward) and the other a smart, versatile pro (29-year-old Marcus Morris) — all buttressed by a staggering assemblage of young talents.\n\nI am talking about 26-year-old Kyrie Irving, 26-year-old Daniel Theis — don’t forget about him — 24-year-old Marcus Smart, 24-year-old Terry Rozier, 21-year-old Jaylen Brown, and 20-year-old Jayson Tatum. And there’s more. There was some evidence on display last season that soon-to-be 23-year-old Guerschon Yabusele and 23-year-old Semi Ojeleye can also play this game. Finally, there is the untapped raw talent of 20-year-old Robert Williams III, who could turn out to be one of those vaunted “rim protectors” but who is not needed right now and who will thus be able to develop at a reasonable pace.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors remain the league’s gold standard. There is no reason not to pick them to win it all again, other than to recall that Houston made a good run last season despite an injury to Chris Paul. And count me among those who think that a humbled Carmelo Anthony could be a huge asset if he consents to come off the bench.\n\nGolden State still has the best 1 to 4, with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Once he gets on the floor DeMarcus Cousins might give them the best 1 to 5. But I honestly don’t think anyone is as good 1 to 10, 11, 12 or 13 as the Boston Celtics. This is a loaded, versatile roster. It is a given that Brad Stevens has a real issue in finding a way to distribute the minutes while keeping everyone, if not happy than not dissatisfied. Ultimately, however, he is at their mercy. In effect, we all are. Do they really want to win a title or don’t they? Can they keep the egos in check? Only they know.\n\nBy the way, there is real competition in the East. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Philly is for real. Toronto handled the Celtics last year and now it has Kawhi Leonard, who is an upgrade from DeMar DeRozan. Milwaukee has the Greek Freak and a few more things. Indy’s not bad. Miami is sneaky good. But I’m putting it on the Celtics. The Finals are a very realistic goal.\n\nLast season’s team really captured local imaginations. There was more Celtics talk around here last spring than I’ve heard since Larry left.\n\nOn Tuesday night the 76ers are here. Time to start talking Celtics once again."
