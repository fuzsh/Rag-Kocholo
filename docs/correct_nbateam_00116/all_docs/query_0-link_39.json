        "text": "On this day in 2004, former Boston Celtics shooting guard and champion Tony Allen played his first game for the team in a close 98 – 95 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe former Oklahoma State Cowboy — drafted by the Celtics with the 25th pick of that summer’s draft — didn’t have the most spectacular outing in his first appearance in green and white, but it wasn’t very indicative of his potential as a player in retrospect.\n\nAllen would put up 2 points on a single shot attempt, and grabbed as many rebounds in his inaugural performance against the 76ers.\n\nHe was on the floor for just inside six minutes, with a single turnover and one personal foul.\n\nThese two share their debut date with former Celtic center Al Jefferson, who debuted in the same game as Tony Allen against the Sixers.\n\nIt was an especially rough game for the Mississippi native, who went scoreless in three minutes, logging 2 personal fouls.\n\n[jwplayer zYt8AP5f]"
