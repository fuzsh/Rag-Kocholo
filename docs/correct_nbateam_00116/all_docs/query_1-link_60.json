        "text": "Times were tough for the Celtics during the middle of a long winter in 2007.\n\nFrom Jan. 7-Feb. 11, they set a franchise record by losing 18 straight games as part of what would be a 24-win season, and the only light at the end of the tunnel was the possibility of winning the draft lottery to select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant.\n\nThrough all that futility, the absolute low point occurred on the night of Jan. 31, 2007 when the building known then as the TD Banknorth Garden felt like an arena on the opposite coast.\n\nAs the Celtics were being handed their 13th straight setback that night by the Los Angeles Lakers, the usual “Beat LA’’ chants were replaced by “MVP’’ that were directed at Lakers guard Kobe Bryant.\n\nIn three and a half decades covering the Celtics, that scene ranks right up there among the strangest this reporter has witnessed.\n\nCertainly, opposing players have been recognized for their performances against Boston teams, but a member of the Lakers being given the “MVP’’ chant? That was unheard of, unthinkable, and a once-in-a-lifetime moment.\n\nThe Garden was taken over by Lakers fans wearing LA jerseys that night as the Celtics fell to 12-33 with a starting lineup consisting of Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, Delonte West and Kendrick Perkins. Brian Scalabrine scored 17 points off the bench, a rookie named Rajon Rondo scored two points with four assists and Paul Pierce was out with an injury.\n\nBryant stole the show with 43 points to help beat the Celtics, 111-98, hitting 13 of 25 shots with seven 3-pointers, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n\nThose Lakers fans in attendance and some Celtics fans frustrated at the state of their team serenaded Bryant with those loud “MVP’’ chants.\n\n“It felt amazing having that chant take place at that time,’’ said Bryant in reflection nearly nine years later. “But it was a different animal, too, because the Celtics were really struggling. It was a great opportunity for the undercover Lakers fans to come out to Boston for the game.\n\n“It was a little deceptive because there were so many Lakers fans. But 2008 on, that wasn’t going to happen.’’\n\nThe year 2008 is when Bryant got to play for an NBA championship in the Garden, reviving the old Celtics-Lakers rivalry not only that season but in 2010 as well.\n\nBryant, who called himself a basketball historian, was thrilled to have that opportunity since Boston was always a special stop on the NBA circuit.\n\nOther than that one night in 2007, Bryant was a villain in Boston, but his game as thoroughly appreciated by Celtics fans, who are mourning the death of a basketball legend and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash that killed seven others Sunday in California.\n\nIt was stunning news that brought everything to a standstill, the 41-year-old Bryant gone in shocking fashion.\n\nFor basketball fans, he leaves behind plenty of memories, and even though the Celtics and Lakers played just twice a year, he put on a lot of shows during 17 regular-season visits to Boston.\n\nHis final trip was Dec. 30, 2015 when a bad Lakers team defeated the Celtics, 112-104, with Bryant missing 13 of 18 shots but hitting a clutch 3-pointer with less than two minutes to go for the clincher.\n\nByrant’s career was celebrated that night in Boston since it was his farewell performance in these parts, and there were “Kobe Bryant’’ chants as the game went on. He received a loud ovation during pregame introductions, was booed as soon as the game started, then got a resounding sendoff.\n\nBryant’s wife, Vanessa, and their children made the trip to the East Coast to witness his last Boston game.\n\n“It was great, man,’’ said Bryant of the atmosphere. “Being able to say thank you to the fans, it was a beautiful moment. It was unbelievable. It felt great to get booed. The recognition at the top of the game, and then as soon as I touched the ball and they booed, I was like ‘Ah.’ It felt great.\n\n“You know, honestly if I could chant for them, I would. I don’t think the fans here really understand how much they drove me. From the singing of the songs, the shaking of the bus going back to the hotel, you know, that stuff really stuck with me.\n\n“I mean it drove me to maniacal proportions, you know what I mean? So I don’t think they really understand they meant to my career. I wish I could do more to show my gratitude to them. And I just tried to say thank you as much as I possibly could.\n\n“This place has really meant a lot for my career. I can’t stress that enough. And this is why I wanted my kids here. I wanted my family here.’’\n\nOne season after Bryant received those “MVP’’ chants, the Celtics made wholesale changes, acquiring both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, and suddenly a Boston-LA pairing in the NBA Finals was a strong possibility.\n\nBryant longed for the chance to face the Celtics with a title on the line, and it became reality with the Celtics winning in 2008 and the Lakers taking the rematch in 2010.\n\n“When that came to be, it was like, ‘Whoa, this will be pretty cool,’ ’’ said Bryant. “Then it was like, ’OK, I can’t mess this up\n\n“I grew up a really big historian of the game and understanding Boston’s history, the players, the lineage of the players, the championships won. This place was always special to me from the first time I came into the league. The history is what I think makes this city different from all the rest.’’\n\n“It’s always cool when I come here. I always look into the rafters and scan the crowd and kind of appreciate the sea of green.’’\n\nKobe Bryant’s contributions to the ancient Celtics-Lakers rivalry was appreciated by those on the other side as well."
