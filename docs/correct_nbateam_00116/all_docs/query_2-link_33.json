        "text": "NBA Comparison: N/A\n\nJefferson has a future in the NBA. Unlike most players that are bigger than the competition, Jefferson works hard at getting position instead of standing around in the paint hoping for the ball. He is very confident in his offensive skills. He has nice footwork, soft hands and uses the glass well. It’s pretty rare to see a post player take on the role as the vocal leader. Jefferson isn’t afraid of shouldering that responsibility. He is an intelligent player and helps his teammates understand their individual roles on the team. He’s a fierce competitor that will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. Jefferson does lag a bit in transition. That could be accredited to his added weight. He’s not a “fat kid” as some have put it. He’s just a really solid player. According to his coaches, Jefferson’s added weight has slowed down his jumping ability. They said that in times past, the big man was always dunking on defenders in the paint. Now, he uses the glass and plays a little more sheepishly. A workout program will do him some good in order to tone his body out."
