        "text": "Al Jefferson won’t be a free agent until the summer of 2013, but maybe Doc Rivers was getting in some early recruiting when the two had dinner together Tuesday night.\n\nThen again, the Celtics coach may have lost the improper benefit advantage when Jefferson was walking by the pregame media conference last night.\n\n“Next time you pay,” Rivers said.\n\nIt’s fun to conjure scenarios where the Celts get themselves a certified low-post scorer with a nose for the glass — Jefferson came into last night’s game averaging team-highs of 19.4 points and 9.3 rebounds with Utah — but, in truth, Tuesday was merely the case of a former coach and pupil getting together to renew acquaintances.\n\nOr as Jefferson put it, “Doc has always been like a father figure to me.”\n\nBut as much as Rivers liked Jefferson when the two were here, Rivers can’t regret the trade that fetched Kevin Garnett. Not when he thinks about his championship ring.\n\nAnd Jefferson is happy with the Jazz, but his future in Salt Lake City may not be entirely his own decision.\n\n“Right now, yeah, it’s home,” he said. “I would like to continue to play there. I love the team. I love the fans, I love the city. I’m a free agent after next year, but hopefully that could be my home. But I know they’ve got some talented bigs behind me — Derrick Favors and “Big Turkey” (Enes Kanter).\n\n“I’ll cross that bridge when I get there, man. I understand the situation. They’ve got two good young guys, and I tell them all the time they’re going to be the future of the Utah Jazz. They’ve got great upside.”\n\nIt is also important to note that Jefferson will be all of 28 years old when he hits the free agent market (assuming he doesn’t sign an extension with Utah or a potential trade partner this summer).\n\n“I hope the Jazz make my job easy as far as staying there, but I understand it’s a business, and they’ve got to do what’s best for their team,” Jefferson said. “I know sooner or later I’m going to have to make some big time decisions, but I hope the Jazz make it easy for me.”\n\nOn the other hand, if he were to be a Celtic again, Jefferson could save himself a flight.\n\n“This is my home away from home,” he said. “I come back here every summer to work out with my trainer.\n\n“Most all my friends are gone, but Paul (Pierce)’s still here. I’ve always been a big fan of Ray (Allen). I always watch them and want them to succeed.”\n\nJefferson has a different relationship with Garnett, a regular combatant.\n\n“I’m a basketball fan, and Kevin Garnett has always been one of my favorite players to watch growing up, and even since I’ve been in the league,” Jefferson said. “I know me and him don’t get along or whatever, but you can’t help but to respect him as a player for the things that he did. He paved the way for me coming out of high school. I’ve always been a big fan of his game and how hard he works and how consistent he is. I would be fooling myself if I didn’t like his game or didn’t like him as a player.\n\n“That’s KG. I don’t think it’s nothing personal. I just think when he’s on that court, if you ain’t on his team, you’re the enemy. You can’t knock a guy for that. That’s the way he is, and sometimes that’s the way you’ve got to be.”\n\nAnd right now Jefferson is being the way he’s got to be.\n\n“He’s been great for us,” Utah coach Tyrone Corbin said. “He’s leading this team. He understands how to approach the game every night, and he knows we’re going to have to go to him to carry us. He’s lived up to his responsibility. He’s been consistent all year as far as doing the right things for us.”\n\nWhich is kind of what Jefferson does. No matter who’s paying."
