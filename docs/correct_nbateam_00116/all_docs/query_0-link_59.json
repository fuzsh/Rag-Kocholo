        "text": "CHARLOTTE – Two seasons ago, Al Jefferson was at the top of his game entering the 2014 NBA playoffs.\n\nNot only was he soon to be named a third team All-NBA player – the first and thus far only such honor in his 12-year career – but he’d helped the previously moribund Charlotte Hornets franchise to a surprising playoff appearance.\n\nBut with the spotlight at its brightest – Charlotte was facing the two-time defending champion Miami Heat – a foot injury set in motion what has been nothing short of repeated aggravation for Jefferson in the years since.\n\nOn Sunday at 5:30 p.m., when Charlotte opens a best-of-seven Eastern Conference first-round playoff series at Miami, Jefferson will get his reprieve, albeit in a far different role that the last time he and the Hornets met the Heat in the playoffs.\n\n“I’m looking forward to it,” said Jefferson, who has emerged as the Hornets’ top scorer off the bench with averages of 12.0 points, 6.4 rebounds and 23.2 minutes in 47 games. “It’s a rematch from two years ago and I’m ready to tip it off. For a lot of guys on that (2014) team, it was a first-time playoffs or it was a first time in the playoffs playing a big role. It was a good experience for us.\n\nThe Hornets were swept in that series, making the franchise 0-8 in the playoffs since the Bobcats came to Charlotte in 2004.\n\n“I don't think personally we could’ve beat them. But … now we’re back and it’s a totally different team in Miami and totally different team in us and we’re looking forward to it,” Jefferson said.\n\nJefferson’s path from top scorer and rebounder – he averaged team-highs of 21.8 points and 10.8 rebounds in the 2013-14 season – has taken many twists and turns.\n\nIt started with an injury-riddled 2014-15 season that carried over into this season. But after serving a five-game suspension for violating the NBA drug policy and missing 23 games following knee surgery, Jefferson has slowly but surely returned to form by leading the Hornets’ reserves.\n\nIn that new role, Jefferson will hope he can advance past the first round for the first time in his career. In his rookie year, his Boston Celtics lost to the Indiana Pacers in seven games in 2005. Jefferson and the Utah Jazz were swept out of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs in 2012 before the Hornets lost to Miami two years ago.\n\n“I think that it can be, in many ways, a career-changer,” charlotte coach Steve Clifford said of Jefferson. “It’s an opportunity that you don’t get many times. To be on a team that has a chance to win a series or two in the playoffs would be a big deal for a veteran like him.”\n\nJefferson has had seven games of 20 or more points this season, with two coming in the final five games of the season.\n\n“I had been beating myself up lately just trying to get my confidence back and get my game back together,” Jefferson said on April 6 after scoring 24 points in a 111-97 win at New York. “It’s coming into playoff time and I need to be me. I need to be myself. I need to do what I’ve been doing for years.”\n\nBacking up Cody Zeller has allowed Jefferson the opportunity to watch the game from the bench before coming in to give the Hornets’ an offensive boost while frequently working against the opponents’ backup center.\n\n“It’s a wonderful feeling,” Jefferson said. “I’m just happy to have a role on a team with success. You look at some of the best teams, some of the guys that have been big stars their whole career have found a role coming off the bench. (Golden State’s) Andre Iguodala was the finals MVP (last year) coming off the bench. So I’ve never minded that. This team is a special team and we've got a chance to do something great. I’m just happy to be a part of it.”\n\nMore importantly, the injuries that have frustrated Jefferson since suffering a plantar fascia strain in the first quarter of the first game of that 4-0 series sweep loss to Miami in 2014 have disappeared.\n\n“I’m getting there,” Jefferson said. “I’m really getting there. I’m feeling like myself. I don't think I was this healthy at any time last year. I'm feeling good and it’s the perfect time to be feeling this way.”\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22"
