        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – When Gordon Hayward suffered his horrific injury Tuesday night, Pacers backup center Al Jefferson did not see it. Jefferson had briefly walked away from his television. When Jefferson returned, he saw players on both the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers huddled, holding their heads in despair, and praying.\n\nJefferson knew something bad had happened. Then he saw the camera move to Hayward, his former teammate with the Utah Jazz. Jefferson saw the agony on Hayward’s face, but Jefferson turned away before he could see Hayward’s dislocated ankle twisted in such an unnatural way. Jefferson has avoided seeing the replays on social media and television. He doesn’t ever want to see the injury.\n\n“I couldn’t watch it,” Jefferson said. “I can’t stand looking at stuff like that.\n\n“I got to give respect to Boston, seeing one of their top players go down, had to get it out of their head. They played a great game, had a great chance to win the game at the end. I know they were thinking about Gordon all the way. I was thinking about Gordon, and I’m not even his teammate no more.”\n\nJefferson and Hayward were teammates for three years in Utah - Hayward’s first three NBA seasons after leading Butler to the 2010 NCAA national championship game. During each season in Utah, Jefferson saw Hayward’s game develop. Jefferson believed Hayward was destined for his best NBA season, after making his first All-Star team in 2017. He thought Hayward’s decision to sign with the Celtics during the summer was perfect, giving him a chance to reunite with Celtics coach Brad Stevens, who coached Hayward in college at Butler.\n\nMore on the Pacers:\n\n“He’s a good kid,” said Jefferson. “I know how excited he was for this season. The good thing about it is, he’s young. He can bounce back. PG (Paul George) went through it, look at the way he bounced back, and I know Gordon will work hard.\n\n“When he came in as a rookie, you knew he was going to be something. He was very mature for his age and his IQ for the game was very high. The things he did the last two or three years didn’t surprise me. Going to Boston, getting back with his old coach from college, he was really looking forward to how that was going to turn out.”\n\nJefferson said he did not reach out to Hayward on Tuesday night, but he would later.\n\n“I’m just praying for him,” Jefferson said. “I hope he has a speedy recovery.”\n\nMyles Turner and Thaddeus Young are voted Pacers co-captains this season:\n\nIn a vote among Pacers players, Turner and Young were named co-captains. The result was not surprising. Though just 21 years old, Turner is viewed as the new face of the franchise and he is mature beyond his years. Young has spent 11 seasons in the NBA, and has become one of the locker room’s most respected voices.\n\nTurner has not been bashful about saying the Pacers will be better than most people respect.\n\n“I’m excited about playing in front of our home fans,” said Turner at Wednesday’s shootaround, prior to the season opener Wednesday night against the Brooklyn Nets. “There’s a lot of excitement going around this town, a lot of people are looking forward to see what we’re capable of doing. I know we’re going to surprise some people this year. I have confidence in this group.”\n\nJefferson ready to accept new role playing fewer minutes.\n\nEven if coach Nate McMillan uses a 10-man rotation, don’t expect Jefferson to see regular minutes unless the team’s big men get in foul trouble. Jefferson has been a starter most of his career, but this season the Pacers are asking him to be a mentor to young players, and to accept not playing on a regular basis. Some veterans would balk at that role, but Jefferson said he would embrace it.\n\n“I get a chance to come to work every day around some young talented guys,” said Jefferson. “When coach needs me, I’m going to be there. That’s how I’m looking at it. It’s still the best job in the world. This is my 14th year. What could I complain about?”\n\nFollow IndyStar sports writer Clifton Brown on Twitter @CliftonGBrown"
