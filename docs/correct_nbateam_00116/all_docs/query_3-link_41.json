This group will help fill in the gap in radiology education that currently exists among all of the Jefferson colleges, in order to expose and encourage students to pursue a career in the radiologic sciences as well as educate students about the field who are not pursuing radiology.\n\nCurrently, students have limited exposure to radiology during preclinical years. We would like to expose more students to radiology earlier in their careers so that they can make a more educated decision in regards to their future specialty. Furthermore, even for those who are not going into radiology, learning how to interpret basic imaging modalities will be very useful in many clinical endeavors. In the short term, we hope to start some preliminary educational programs to serve as longitudinal resources that students can benefit from even during the early stages of their schooling. After the group has been established for several years, we hope to expand to more advanced events, such as hands-on training and collaboration with other institutions in Philadelphia.\n\nContact Information\n\nOrganization Email: drig@students.jefferson.edu\n\nStudent Organization Advisor: Robert Ford | Assistant Professor, Division of Interventional Radiology | 111 South 11th Street, Suite 5340, Philadelphia, PA 19107 | 215-955-6440\n\nGenetics and Genomics Society at Jefferson\n\nMembership Eligibility: All Members of the Jefferson Community\n\nMembership Dues or Fees: None\n\nDescription: The Genetics and Genomics Society at Jefferson's goal is to promote student awareness and education regarding genetics and genomics in the practice of medicine and act as a resource for students interested in exploring potential career paths in genetics and genomics.

Jeff Anki aims to cultivate a larger community of learners at SKMC who are passionate about revolutionizing medical education. Among studying techniques, digital flashcards have proven to be particularly effective in memorizing finer details once a higher understanding of material has been mastered. Currently, many SKMC students resort to using either pre-made third-party flashcards or creating their own, which can be a time-consuming (>20 hours per week) and potentially harmful process (e.g., risk of carpal tunnel). Jeff Anki seeks to mitigate these issues by creating a collaborative flashcard bank through an application called Anki, which will be accessible to all SKMC students. This will not only save time, but also enable students to engage in other pursuits such as volunteering, research, leadership, and shadowing.\n\nContact Information\n\nOrganization Email: Coming Fall 2023\n\nStudent Organization Advisor: Paul Howard, PT, DPT, PhD, OCS, FAAOMPT | Clinical Professor | Department of Medical Edication\n\nJefferson Athlete Health Organization\n\nMembership Eligibility: All members of Jefferson community\n\nMembership Dues or Fees: None\n\nDescription: The Jefferson Athlete Health Organization aims to allow Jefferson students to gain exposure to the field of sports medicine, with the goal of helping students explore sports medicine prior to making career decisions.
