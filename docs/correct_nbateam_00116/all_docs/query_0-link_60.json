Vote below and help decide the greatest Boston Celtics center of all time!\n\nMost divisive: Kendrick Perkins\n\nOver 900 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Boston Celtics Centers of All Time\n\nBirthplace : West Monroe, Louisiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Center\n\nBoston Celtics: 1956–1969\n\nA vital cornerstone of the Boston Celtics' unparalleled success throughout the 1960s, Bill Russell was drafted to the team in 1956 and quickly became an anchor on defense. Known for his unparalleled shot-blocking ability and tenacious rebounding, Russell consistently thwarted opponents' offensive attacks, helping to secure a staggering 11 NBA championships during his time in Boston. In addition to being a five-time NBA MVP, he was instrumental in redefining the role of the center and elevating the importance of defense in the sport overall. His legacy remains intact as one of the greatest players in the history of the game and a true Celtics legend.\n\nBirthplace : Shreveport, Louisiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Center\n\nBoston Celtics: 1980–1994\n\nAs a key component of the Celtics' formidable frontcourt during the 1980s, Robert Parish was acquired by the team in a trade from the Golden State Warriors in 1980. This dominant \"Chief\" teamed up with Larry Bird and Kevin McHale to form one of the most feared frontcourts in NBA history, capturing three NBA championships along the way. Parish's intimidating size and strength, combined with his uncanny agility for a man of his stature, made him a force to be reckoned with both offensively and defensively. A nine-time All-Star and Hall of Fame inductee, Parish's time with the Celtics cemented his place among the pantheon of the league's elite centers.\n\nBirthplace : Newport, Kentucky\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nBoston Celtics: 1970–1980\n\nDrafted by the Celtics in 1970, Dave Cowens brought a relentless work ethic and unmatched hustle to the court during his tenure in Boston. Though slightly undersized for a center at 6'9\", Cowens compensated for this with an all-out effort and dogged determination that earned him the respect and admiration of both teammates and opponents alike. During his time with the Celtics, Cowens collected two NBA championships, one MVP award, and eight All-Star selections - all the while demonstrating that heart and grit can sometimes trump physical attributes. Cowens remains a beloved figure in Boston Celtics lore, having given his all for the franchise and personifying Celtic pride.\n\nBirthplace : Greenville, South Carolina\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Brooklyn Nets\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nBoston Celtics: 2007–2013\n\nAcquired in a blockbuster trade from the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2007, Kevin Garnett instantly transformed the fortunes of the storied but struggling Celtics franchise. With an incredibly versatile skillset and unparalleled intensity on both ends of the court, Garnett quickly formed a formidable partnership with fellow Celtics stars Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, culminating in an NBA championship in 2008. During his six years in Boston, Garnett earned five All-Star selections, a Defensive Player of the Year award, and countless unforgettable moments that endeared him to the Celtics' faithful. Though his tenure in green was relatively brief compared to some other legendary Celtics centers, Garnett's contributions to the franchise are undeniable and will forever be etched in the annals of its illustrious history.\n\nBirthplace : La Mesa, California\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Portland Trail Blazers, Boston Celtics, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nBoston Celtics: 1985–1987\n\nJoining the Boston Celtics in 1985 after a storied yet injury-plagued career with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Clippers, Bill Walton provided a critical spark off the bench for the '85-'86 championship team. Known for his elite passing ability and basketball IQ, Walton's presence on the Celtics added depth and versatility to an already formidable roster. Winning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award during his first season in Boston, Walton's contributions were instrumental in what many consider the greatest single-season team in NBA history. Though his time with the Celtics was short-lived, Walton's impact was undeniable, and his name remains synonymous with that legendary squad.\n\nBirthplace : Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic\n\nNationality : Dominican Republic\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics\n\nPosition : Center\n\nBoston Celtics: 2016–2019, 2021-2022\n\nSigning with the Celtics as a free agent in the summer of 2016, Al Horford brought a steady veteran presence and all-around skillset to a young, emerging roster. Capable of stretching the floor with his shooting range and serving as an anchor on defense, Horford played an essential role in the Celtics' rapid ascent back to title contention. His unselfish play and leadership helped guide the team to multiple Eastern Conference Finals appearances during his three-year tenure in Boston. While Horford may not have captured an NBA championship with the Celtics, his impact on the team's development and success during his time there cannot be overstated."
