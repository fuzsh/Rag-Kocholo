        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Tristan Thompson’s tenure with the Cleveland Cavaliers has come to an end.\n\nThompson agreed to a two-year, $19 million deal with the Boston Celtics on Saturday night, league sources tell cleveland.com. The Celtics will sign Thompson using the full mid-level exception -- an offer that came in higher than Cleveland’s, sources say.\n\nEarly in the day, there was a bit of optimism inside Cleveland Clinic Courts, especially as potential Thompson suitors started to dwindle. But Boston target Paul Millsap rebuffed its offer and returned to Denver instead, creating a path for Thompson to join the Eastern Conference contender.\n\n“Going from being a fan to an opponent and then a teammate, Tristan has always been one of the good guys,” Larry Nance Jr. told cleveland.com. “His jersey deserves to hang in the rafters.”\n\nThompson was the No. 4 pick of the 2011 draft, selected three picks after Kyrie Irving.\n\nDuring his nine-year career -- all with the Cavs -- Thompson averaged 9.4 points and 8.7 rebounds. He played in 619 regular season games and 78 more in the postseason, helping the Cavaliers to their lone NBA title in 2016. This past season, the final year of his previous $80 million deal, Thompson filled a vital leadership role for a young, rebuilding team. He averaged a double-double, with 12.0 points and 10.1 rebounds.\n\nKnown for his passion, toughness and reliability, Thompson leaves Cleveland with the franchise record for consecutive games played (477). He also ranks top 10 in games played (7th), offensive rebounds (2nd), total rebounds (3rd), field goal percentage (7th), minutes (8th) and blocks (6th).\n\nThompson’s final game in Cleveland ended early. On March 8, Thompson got hit in the face during a matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. He played just eight minutes before getting helped off the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse court for what turned out to be the last time this season -- and his Cavaliers career (unless he returns at some point in the future). Thompson didn’t play in the team’s following game against the Chicago Bulls, and then coronavirus prematurely ended Cleveland’s season.\n\n“Memories have been great,” Thompson said during a Zoom call with reporters on May 14. “Getting drafted in 2011, winning a championship, then being in the lottery, been at the bottom and top. I think it’s a great experience for my career, especially with one team and going through all those different storylines, it’s been a blessing.\n\n“Being in my ninth season, never thought in a million years I would have the success I’ve had, so for me it’s just taking it one day at a time and enjoying every bit of it. Meeting so many great people, being part of a franchise and city that’s been through so many tough times and being able to break the 52-year drought -- that was the most important thing I think in my time here. I wouldn’t change it for the world.”\n\nWith Thompson headed to Boston and Matthew Dellavedova an unrestricted free agent, Kevin Love is the lone remaining player from the 2016 championship team.\n\nThe Cavs entered free agency hoping to re-sign Thompson, but it always had to be the right deal financially. They will now try to fill the backup center spot using the mid-level exception -- or at least part of it. The Cavs have two open roster spots and are about $13 million below the luxury tax threshold. They also signed Jordan Bell to a two-year deal in late June and he could get some playing time at the 5.\n\nThe Celtics have long had an affinity for Thompson, even making past trade inquiries, sources say. In Boston, Thompson is expected to split the center minutes with Daniel Theis, who had his contract for the 2020-21 season become fully guaranteed, and 2018 first-round pick Robert Williams III.\n\nThompson, 6-foot-9, is a good defender, elite screen-setter and one of the league’s best offensive rebounders. He’s strong enough to defend the paint and quick enough to switch onto smaller guards. That defensive versatility, combined with his rebounding prowess and postseason experience, will give the Celtics the kind of interior presence they lacked during the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat and All-Star Bam Adebayo.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Information, the Celtics haven’t had a player average double-digit rebounds since Al Jefferson in 2006-07 -- the longest active drought in the NBA.\n\nDuring the league’s free agency period, contracts can’t become official until Sunday.\n\nYahoo Sports first reported the agreement.\n\nMore Cavaliers coverage\n\nCavaliers sign Isaac Okoro to rookie deal\n\nCavaliers drafting Okoro is a ‘big first step’ in turning around the NBA’s worst defense\n\nCavaliers’ top free agency options start with their own players\n\nIn entitlement mess of NBA draft, Cavaliers seem to make a safe, smart pick: Pluto"
