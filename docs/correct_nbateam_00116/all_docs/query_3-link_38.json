My name is Deb Hosemann, and I am originally from Iowa where I grew up and lived for 20 years. Prior to moving to the beautiful state of Alabama 18 years ago, I lived in Louisiana with my ever-growing family. I am a graduate of Western Illinois University with a degree in Elementary Education, utilizing my degree in both Iowa and Louisiana. Teaching for seven years and directing a preschool for five years has provided me with tremendous opportunities to develop great communication skills. Over the past 17 years, I have owned my own business in the heart of Hoover, and most recently, I published my first children’s book. I am the mother of four adult children, and I am a grandmother of two beautiful little girls.\n\nToday, I am proud to say that I am part of the Jefferson Matthews team and am very eager to contribute my skills as both an educator and a business owner to the growth of this wonderful company!\n\nLinda Fitts\n\nFirst Impression Manager\n\nHi, my name is Linda Robert Fitts. I was born in Decatur, Alabama and lived there for twenty years. After getting married, I moved to Birmingham where I started working in the banking industry. As my family began to grow, I entered the medical field in a managerial role. After 30 years of working with Birmingham area hospitals I entered my golden retirement years. I am the proud mother of four beautiful adult daughters and seven lovely grandchildren, whom I so greatly enjoy the company of. I love going to church, traveling, shopping, and spending time with my family. I was introduced to Jefferson Matthews while attending a seminar, and I was very impressed with AJ. I became a client, came out of retirement, and am now a member of the Jefferson Matthews family. It has been a pleasure and a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to see what the future holds!\n\nDrew Hosemann\n\nJunior Advisor\n\nHello, my name is Drew Hosemann! I was born in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, but then moved to Birmingham in 2005 where I have lived since. I have a 5 year old Great Pyrenees named Leo and though he is extremely cute, he is also incredibly uncoordinated! I have two precious nieces that live with my oldest sister, and being the youngest of four, having toddlers around is a completely new experience for me. I graduated from Spain Park in 2020. In my time there I was a member of the football team, engineering academy, as well as student government. I was brought on to Jefferson Matthews Wealth Solutions in 2022, and I think that educating oneself on financial literacy is an imparative aspect in a successful life. I feel so fortunate to be learning and growing with this company, as well as developing important life and financial skills along the way. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, working out, and watching NFL Football.
