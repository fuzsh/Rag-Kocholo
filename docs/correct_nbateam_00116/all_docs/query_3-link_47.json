        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Al Jefferson is doubtful for Game 4 Monday night against the Miami Heat due to a lingering foot injury, according to Bobcats coach Steve Clifford.\n\nJefferson, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, has been hobbled since straining the plantar fascia in his left foot in the first quarter of Game 1.\n\nHe didn't participate in Monday's shoot around.\n\n\"He's not close to where he was for the last two games,\" Clifford said.\n\nClifford said in Game 3 Jefferson's foot got worse as the game progressed and having only one day off in between games didn't help his chances of being ready for Game 4. Jefferson hobbled noticeably Monday as he left the gym after watching teammates shoot around in practice.\n\nJefferson said he feels as if he's \"walking on needles.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone,\" Jefferson said. \"It's the worst pain I've ever dealt with in my career.\"\n\nJefferson wouldn't rule himself out, saying he's taking things hour-to-hour.\n\n\"I'm seeing how it's going to feel and go from there,\" Jefferson said.\n\nMiami leads the series 3-0 and can close out the Bobcats with a win Monday night in Charlotte.\n\nClifford said Bismack Biyombo is expected to start for Jefferson.\n\nThat represents a major dropoff in production, particularly from the offensive end. Jefferson averaged 21.8 points and 10.8 rebound per game in his first season with the Bobcats, while Biyombo has never scored more than 14 points in a game.\n\nBiyombo has only played 15 minutes in the playoffs and scored one point.\n\nJefferson's teammates said they respect his ability to get on the floor the past two games.\n\n\"He has given us all he can,\" point guard Kemba Walker said. \"And I think down to a man we appreciate his effort. He's been nothing but great for us. He has been playing really well and he's not 100 percent.\"\n\nSaid Clifford: \"I know how badly Al wants to play. The most upset person about this is him. So it's frustrating, but again it's part of pro sports.\"\n\nClifford said the Bobcats will play more five-man basketball using pick and rolls, rather than relying on Jefferson in the low post. Walker, the team's second-leading scorer, will be relied upon to help pick up the slack in Jefferson's absence.\n\n\"We have to find better ways for Kemba to be on the attack,\" Clifford said.\n\nJefferson said it's frustrating that he worked so hard all season only to injure the foot in the first quarter of the playoffs.\n\n\"This season has been a great season for all of the things we have done so far,\" Jefferson said. \"We are going into the game tonight trying to win... Regardless of what may happen it has been a wonderful season and guys have a lot to be proud of for the things we have done this season. But we can't take any steps back. We have to continue to build and get better.\"\n\nJefferson said he won't need surgery after the season."
