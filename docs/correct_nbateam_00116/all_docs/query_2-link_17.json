        "text": "When healthy, he is a double-double threat every time he steps on the court. He averaged 21.8 points and 10.8 rebounds a night in his first season with the Hornets in 2013-14 (as a third-team All-NBA member) and followed that up with 16.6 points and 8.4 rebounds a night last year. Prior to the injury, he was averaging 12.5 points and 6.1 rebounds in the 2015-16 campaign.\n\nJefferson is also a solid interior defender who averaged at least a block a game every season since 2006-07, when he was with the Boston Celtics. Opponents shot 1.8 percent worse from inside 10 feet when Jefferson was guarding them last year than their typical averages, per NBA.com."
