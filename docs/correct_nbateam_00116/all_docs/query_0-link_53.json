        "text": "MANHATTAN, Kan. Former Kansas State forward Jeremiah Massey has agreed to join the Boston Celtics’ summer league team in hopes of making the team’s 14-man roster.\n\nThe 12-man roster will play six games in the Reebok Vegas Summer League in Las Vegas, Nev., from July 7-15. The Celtics will play the Los Angeles Clippers on July 7, the Dallas Mavericks on July 8, the Phoenix Suns on July 11, the Cleveland Cavaliers on July 12, the Golden State Warriors on July 14 and the Detroit Pistons on July 15.\n\nMassey is one of four invited players on the Celtics’ roster, along with Will Bynum (Georgia Tech), Taylor Coppenrath (Vermont) and Will McDonald (South Florida). The foursome joins the team’s three picks from the 2005 NBA Draft, Gerald Green (Gulf Shores Academy), Ryan Gomes (Providence) and Orien Greene (Louisiana-Lafayette) as well as last year’s rookie class of Al Jefferson (Prentiss High School), Delonte West (St. Joseph’s), Tony Allen (Oklahoma State) and Justin Reed (Mississippi). Kendrick Perkins (Clifton J. Ozen High School) will also join the squad. The team will be coached by current Celtics’ head coach Doc Rivers.\n\nOne of the top two-year players in Kansas State history, Massey finished his career ranking 25th on the school’s all-time scoring list with 931 points. His 16.3 career scoring average placed ninth in school history and sixth among two-year players, while his point total was the fifth-highest among two-year players and were the most since Mitch Richmond scored 1,327 points from 1987-88.\n\nAs a senior, Massey averaged a team-best 17.9 points and 6.9 rebounds en route to earning second team All-Big 12 honors from both the league coaches and The Associated Press. He was one of only three players (Wayne Simien and Joey Graham) in the Big 12 Conference to rank among the league’s top 10 in scoring, field goal percentage and rebounding in 2004-05.\n\nFans can keep track of the team’s results by logging on to the Boston Celtics’ official website at http://www.nba.com/celtics/summerleague/SummerLeague05.html."
