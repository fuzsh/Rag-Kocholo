        "text": "Al Jefferson made history before ever suiting up for the Celtics, becoming the first player drafted by the franchise directly out of high school. As a 6-foot-10 center, Jefferson averaged nearly a block per game during his rookie year. Due to injuries, Jefferson missed 23 games during his second season, including his bobblehead night on April 9, 2006. About 16 months later, the Celtics traded “Big Al” to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of the blockbuster deal that brought Kevin Garnett to Boston."
