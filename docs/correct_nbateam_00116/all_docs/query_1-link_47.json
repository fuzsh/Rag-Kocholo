        "text": "By TOM WILLIAMS\n\nChris Ford was the face of Cape-Atlantic League basketball.\n\nWhen great players would come along – Reggie Miller, Alan Shaw, Walt Montford, Rick Harmon, Lou Roe, LaMarr Greer – they would be compared to Chris. But very few athletes from this area in any sport – probably only Mike Trout – had post-high school careers to compare with his.\n\nHe played in the NCAA championship game in the Houston Astrodome for Villanova and was inducted into the Big Five Hall of Fame. He was drafted by the Detroit Pistons and later traded to the Boston Celtics, in a successful NBA career. But the thing that stands out is with all of these accomplishments, the type of person he was.\n\nChris Ford, who died suddenly this week, made a great impression on the people he knew. Here is what some of them remember.\n\nDr. Fred Dalzell, multi-sport Holy Spirit all star and Chris Ford teammate: “Chris Ford had exploded on the basketball scene in 1964 at Holy Spirit and by the time I arrived as a freshman in 1966 the gym was packed and he was well on his way to becoming a legend. He took me under his wing knowing it was hard to play varsity basketball as a freshman and told me that ‘you have the talent and you belong belong here’. It was a great comfort coming from the star of the team. He didn’t have to do that, but that was Chris being Chris.. Chris had great talent, but it was his knowledge of the game and leadership that made as big an impression on me. I saw him score 56 in a game and if there was a 3-point shot it would have been 65. His passing was even more impressive (his assist record at Villanova still stands) and if you were open you had better be awake because the ball might come from over his head, between an opponent’s legs or behind his back. Never a gunner, even though no-one would have blamed him if he was, it was always about the team. I’m sure most people will talk of Chris’s incredible basketball accomplishments, but I learned as much from him off the court. He was an old soul who, as a sophomore, kept the team in line. He treated everyone the same and if you met him on or off the court you were a fan for life and to top it off he’d remember your name. He adored his wife and family and was happier at one of their games or events than any pro or college venue. In short, if you saw Chris play you were lucky – if you had him as a teammate it was special – if he was your friend you were blessed.\n\nSkip Castaldi, Hall of Fame basketball player at Mainland: “Over the years, as with most local sports fans, I followed Chris’ basketball achievements. I believe no one in South Jersey ever had more success. As a result of his grandson, C.J., and my grandson being best friends, I observed Chris’ ‘grandfather side’ at our grandsons’ baseball games. Chris always encouraged and supported C.J. and his other team members. Chris truly enjoyed these events. He was a very nice person and will be truly missed.”\n\nLarry DiGiovanni, veteran coach and Chris Ford’s high school teammate: “All Journeys begin somewhere. Chris’ journey began in the small gym called Dante Hall, the gym for St. Michael’s in Atlantic City. We were nine years old. No games, just fundamentals. When we were 12 years old, we played in a national Biddy Basketball Tournament. Baskets were 8 feet 6 inches. We won the state championship and lost in the national semi-finals to Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. You could tell Chris was going to be a special player. Chris was the ultimate teammate. this transcended into his career at Holy Spirit. His willingness and ability to make his teammates better was a gift that great players have. During his sophomore and junior years he could have averaged more points then he did. However, he made sure his teammates were involved. Consequently all five starters averaged double figures on two of Spirit’s finest teams ever. His senior year, when four of us graduated, he averaged 33 points per game. The rest of his basketball career is well documented. Upon reflection, over seven decades Chris Ford made poeple feel special. He was humble, thoughtful and never forgot his roots. Married to his high school sweetheart, Kathy, together they raised a wonderful family and he was a true role model. Not only is Chris the best basketball player to ever emerge from our area, he was also one of our greatest ambassadors and leaders. For years to come, his legacy will go beyond basketball. A journey that began in a small gym but had a lasting effect on thousands.”\n\nJohn Cranston, Ocean City Hall of Fame basketball player: “I remember a young Chris coming to one of OCHS’ practices in 1963-64 with Boo Pergament. Dixie had me play him one on one and then we had a foul shooting contest. I barely beat him one on one and he crushed me shooting fouls. I didn’t even know who he was at that point but I guess he was an 8th grader. I was embarrassed when I found out how young he was but from that point on I took credit for teaching him how to play. But he was much more than a basketball player. I ran into him a few times over the years and he was always gracious to me and actually remembered who I was. He always talked about what a great team OCHS had in those days and told me how much he enjoyed coming to that practice and watching our games. I wonder if he would have been so gracious if he knew I was taking credit for his successful basketball career. Knowing him I doubt if he would have minded. Barry Banks told me that many years later he was at a Pistons game in Detroit when Chris walked by on the court on his way to warmup. Barry yelled out ‘Hey, Chris’ and Chris turned, saw him, and yelled back ‘Hey, Barry’. Barry was floored, as you might imagine. But that was the kind of guy Chris Ford was,”\n\nDick Vitale, basketball Hall of Famer and Chris Ford’s first NBA coach: “Chris Ford was a natural leader and a fierce competitor who always competed with one purpose in mind, which was to help his team get to the winner’s circle. He was highly respected by all of his teammates and all the coaches who have ever worked with him due to his amazing work ethic that played a vital role in getting the maximum out of his talent. I loved the short time when I had the opportunity to coach him while he was with the Detroit Pistons. I always felt that it was a mistake when we traded Chris because he was more than just a basketball player, he was a bona fide leader on and off the court. My sympathies go out to his family, friends and all who played a part in his life. May he rest in peace.”\n\nPaul Rodio, South Jersey’s only 1,000-win coach: “Chris Ford was a true icon in South Jersey. He changed the high school game in the late 60’s and went on to become a great player in both college and the NBA. However, he always was a great person and role model for everyone. He was someone I looked up to.”\n\nFran O’Hanlon, Villanova teammate: “His college nickname was Hot Dog because of his enthusiasm. But there was nothing about him that was a hot dog, He was one of the first big guards, a 6-6 guard. He would never get scored on. He was so long, like an octopus. He’s old school. Iverson didn’t do what he was supposed to do and he benched him. This is a rough loss, it really is.”\n\nSteve Parker, Hall of Fame athlete at Mainland: “Chris never made me feel like he was anything except my friend but we all remember how good he was in high school playing the wing most of the time on offense and how good a passer he was. I always wondered how many three-pointers he would have had in high school if that was part of the game back then. As good a player as he was – he played with and against some of the all time greats like Jordan and Bird and with Pistons and Celtics in their heyday as well as coaching the Celtics and Sixers – that was just his resume. He was an even better person. He will be missed.”\n\nLarry Bird, basketball Hall of Famer and Chris Ford teammate: “Chris was such an important part of our success, as a teammate, coach and friend. My thoughts and condolences are with the Ford family.”\n\nGene Allen, retired Atlantic City coach: “I remember as a kid watching Coach Ford playing on channel 17 with Al Meltzer. I was a big Villanova fan and whenever they played I would watch Tommy Ingelsby, Hank Siemiontkowski, Howard Porter and Coach. I cried when they loss to the UCLA Bruins and Coach Wooden. Then my feelings for Coach changed when he played and coached for the rival Boston Celtics. After his tenure in the NBA, I got to know him and I couldn’t believe what a nice person he was. He would always take the time out of his busy schedule to talk to me about all facets of basketball. He encouraged me to be true to my coaching philosophy and beliefs. He was the ambassador for high school basketball in the Cape-Atlantic League. When he took a picture with me and my son, I beamed from ear to ear. Coach, you will be sorely missed. Thank you for being you.”\n\nThe Boston Celtics: “As a player and coach, Chris Ford’s career spanned over a decade of Celtics basketball and he made his mark every step of the way. He was a member of three NBA World Championship teams, one as a key player on the 1981 champions and, subsequently, as an assistant coach for the 1984 and 1986 champs. Ford went on to become the team’s eleventh head coach, leading his former teammates Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish to multiple playoff appearances in the trio’s final days together. ‘Doc’, as he was affectionately known by his teammates, was a fundamentally versatile all-around guard. He was voted the team’s MVP in his first season with the Celtics and he is famously credited with scoring the NBA’s first three-point basket. Ford joined an elite group of Celtics (Bill Russell, Tom Heinsohn and K.C. Jones) who have earned championship rings as both a player and coach with the organization. The Boston Celtics sends its deepest sympathies to the Ford family and its many friends.”\n\nBob Ryan, Hall of Fame columnist with the Boston Globe: “RIP Chris Ford – a player who got everything out of his natural ability and as unpretentious and normal a human being as any coach I’ve ever known. He was like your next door neighbor who just happened to be going to work at The Garden. And, yes, he made the first NBA three.”\n\nTom Inglesby, Villanova teammate: “When we’d get together, we would talk three minutes of Villanova basketball then 20 minutes about our grandkids. He was a great guy, great player, great father, great husband. He just played team ball. He taught the fundamentals. He’d emphasize a commitment to the team. He was a great competitor and just a great teammate.”\n\nJoe Fussner, retired Atlantic City and Stockton coach: “Chris always remembered where he got his start. This area over the past 30+ years has had some truly gifted players, none of them as successful as Chris. There have been many articles recently reminding all of us just how successful his playing and coaching careers were. The last few years, I would have some brief conversations not necessarily just about basketball but our grandchildren. He dedicated his retired life to following his children and grandchildren playing sports. He supported his daughter and son when they coached high school and he spent his final days watching his grandchildren play the sport he truly loved. His passing is a shock to all of us but let’s not forget the joy and pride we all had following his career.\n\nJay Wright, retired Villanova coach: “Chris Ford was my childhood idol. I would pump my fist after every basket like he did at Villanova. I would argue with friends on the playground as we followed every Big 5 game. I would contend he was the best player in the Big 5 – others might score more, but if you added his assists and points he was responsible for more points than anyone. I wore my hair floppy like his – because he was the man! I followed his NBA career as an admirer and fan. When he became a coach I wasn’t surprised. I loved his discipline, toughness and intellect. I first met him when I became a head coach and I was even more impressed with him as a humble, intelligent man of character. He was passionate about our program, our players and our school. His loyalty and love for his teammates was unmatched. He came to every event I asked him to attend. I enjoyed seeing him bring his grandchildren and revel in their enjoyment of Villanova basketball. In the end, I have learned a great deal from Chris in our personal meetings, dinners with his teammates or on the phone. I will most miss our conversations. I listened to every word he said. I always heard from him to be humble, serve others, be a good family man and a loyal friend. I still want to be just like Chris Ford!\n\nDuring the month before his sudden death I had two conversations with Chris. The first, during Tipoff Weekend at Ocean City High School, was about old times and ended with the idea of scheduling a lunch with Larry DiGiovanni and Frank Tummarello. A few weeks later, during halftime of a game at Egg Harbor Township, the discussion was about Frank, who had died suddenly. That death saddened both of us.\n\nAnd now, Chris is gone, too. When he would show up at a game it somehow made that game more important. You felt that, but he didn’t. For you, it was an opportunity for these teams to play before a special audience. But he felt like a typical fan – in many cases a grandfather of father – just there to support his family. He lived a life filled with success – success that he earned through hard work and dedication. He traveled all over the country playing basketball, but he always came back to his roots. As a star athlete should, he married a beauty queen. His wife, Kathy, was as accomplished on the piano as he was on the basketball court. They had four children (including his namesake, currently the athletics director at Atlantic City High School) and seven grandchildren.\n\nTo all of us, he was special. His appearance at a game made us feel good. But to him, he was just a guy who loved basketball and loved his family.\n\nChris Ford was 74."
