        "text": "Boston Celtics Talk...\n\nPosted 05-30-2010 at 06:02 AM by NckWalkr\n\nUpdated 05-30-2010 at 06:51 AM by NckWalkr\n\n[CENTER][IMG]http://makemoneydigital.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/1272559850-45.jpg[/IMG][/CENTER]\n\nSimple question....[B]Why do I hate the Celtics?[/B]\n\nHere is why...\n\nA year ago, even haters had to begrudgingly root for the Boston Celtics. After sinking to new lows in 2006-07, honoring recently deceased coaching legend Red Auerbach with a 24-58 record and a franchise worst 18-game losing streak, the once proud Celts organization finally did something right when general manager Danny Ainge teamed Paul Pierce with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. Perennial All-Stars whod given their best years to ****ty Minnesota Timberwolves and Seattle SuperSonics squads, respectively, they formed The Big Three, a trio of hungry aging ballers who would push their mamas down stairs to win a ring. KG, in particular, changed the culture of the team, convincing guys whod only known losing to hustle and think of the Celts as a brotherhood.\n\n[B]1. Insider Trading:[/B]\n\nThe trade that brought KG and a championship to Boston was made possible by Kevin McHale, the hopelessly inept Minnesota Timberwolves GM who happens to be a former Celtic great. Thanks to him, Minny was destined to do nothing, so he figured hed help his Boston boy Ainge out by giving them an All-Star and fan favorite in exchange for one possible future second fiddle (Al Jefferson), some bench players, two cotton candy vendors and the promise that hed get half off on a replica ring if they won it all. If Martha Stewart had to serve time for her stock dealings, McHale and Ainge should be sharing a prison cell for the next decade running the pick and roll on each others pubes.\n\n[B]2. Crying Game:[/B]\n\nIts impossible to respect Glen Big Baby Davis after he cried and threw a fit on national TV because KG reprimanded him for sucking. In Daviss defense, the arena was dusty. And his thong was really pinching his labia.\n\n[B]3. Young Punks:[/B]\n\nThe downside of KGs chest-thumping, ****-talking and psycho stares is that he has the lil cs thinking they have license to brag and get in peoples faces too, even though they won on the backs of greater men (lengthy NBA pause) and are little more than weed carriers.\n\n[B]4. Jock Supporters:[/B]\n\nBostons miserable, often drunk, often racist fans used to think they were special because their teams always lost. Now they think theyre special because their teams always win. Win or lose, its officially time for a Boston Teabag Party. Well, Boston fans take the cake. Outside of possibly Dallas Cowboys fans, University of Michigan and Notre Dame football fans, I've never come across a fanbase more pompous, cocky and uneducated fans than Boston fans.\n\n[B]5. Champ Change:[/B]\n\nThe Big Three are old (some might say geriatric) news in 2008-09, and the NBA needs a new champion. This year its all about LeBron James and the Cavaliers bringing a title to depressed Cleveland so he can fulfill his promise to his home state before promptly fleeing to [optimistically insert your city here] as a free agent in 2010.\n\n[B]6. Paul Pierce:[/B]\n\nHis team was awful before his GM went out and traded for two superstars, and now all of the sudden he is allegedly one of the greatest Celtics ever huh. This is after he quit on seasons, and led teams towards finishes in the Draft Lottery. You can give LeBron the 11 worst players in the NBA and hell finish outside the lottery, guaranteed. Besides that, all that crying during the ring ceremony was pathetic and saying that he is better than Kobe Bryant was uncalled for.\n\nI'm going to stop right there...I could go further but I won't. Although, do remember that in a professional sense I have respect for the Celtics. And celtics fans, please stop chanting \"Beat LA\" even before the Finals has begun for goodness sake show a bit of class....\n\nBanned"
