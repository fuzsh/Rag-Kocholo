        "text": "The Boston Celtics tried to trade for Utah Jazz forwards Al Jefferson or Paul Millsap earlier this season at the trade deadline, CSN New England reports.\n\nThis tidbit is interesting on multiple levels. For one, Danny Ainge was maintaining the entire time publicly that the Celtics were fine with the team they had and weren't looking for any major moves. So it's pretty shocking to find out a GM would lie about his team's intentions at the trade deadline. (That's sarcasm if you aren't catching it.)\n\nSecond, it shows the Celtics understand how badly they need frontcourt help. The Celtics went super-small this season with Kevin Garnett at the five. Jefferson could have given them a scoring five to pair with Garnett. Millsap would have kept Garnett at the five but given them a much stronger frontcourt pairing, especially on the boards."
