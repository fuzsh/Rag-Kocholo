        "text": "Dominant. Unforgettable. Historic. The list of words that can be used to describe the Golden State Warriors' season is a lengthy one. But what about the NBA's other 29 teams?\n\nWith the regular season nearly three-fourths complete and the playoff race heating up, we chose one word to describe each NBA team based on how their season has panned out up to this point.\n\n(Offensive and defensive ranks via NBA.com's rating per 100 possessions)\n\nAtlanta Hawks: Regression\n\nCurrent record: 32-27 (fifth in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 17th\n\nDefensive rank: Third\n\nFresh off a franchise-best 60 wins and a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals last year, the Hawks have taken a step in the wrong direction this season. While losing three-and-d guy DeMarre Carroll to Toronto in free agency may be the standout reason, the dip in production from veteran guards Jeff Teague (20.64 player efficiency rating in 2014-15 to 17.40 in 2015-16) and Kyle Korver (14.8 PER to 9.70; 49.2% from three to 38.3%) certainly hasn't helped.\n\nNonetheless, the stellar play of Al Horford (20.14 PER) and Paul Millsap (21.81 PER) has kept them afloat, and they're still in the thick of things in the playoff race, albeit not at a level comparable to last season.\n\nBoston Celtics: Synchronization\n\nRecord: 34-25 (third in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 10th\n\nDefensive rank: Fifth\n\nIn a league with superstars aplenty, Boston's main downfall has been the lack of a player that fits the \"superstar\" designation. Instead, the Celtics epitomize what it means to play basketball as a team, as they currently sit in third place in the Eastern Conference as one of the few teams in the league with seven players averaging nine or more points a game. Forward Jae Crowder put it best, per CSN New England:\n\n\"...There’s a lot of talk about we need a superstar and stuff like that. All five guys on the court are so locked in and so engaged that we’re one superstar. We all play together. It’s a scary thing when a team don’t know who to match up to, whose night its going to be on the offensive end. And, defensively, we all fight together and play together. It’s a scary monster to approach.\"\n\nBrooklyn Nets: Astray\n\nCurrent record: 16-42 (14th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 27th\n\nDefensive rank: 26th (tie)\n\nWhat's worse than being a lottery-bound team? Being a lottery-bound team without a first-round draft pick. The Nets are still feeling the negative effects of the Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce trade gone awry back in 2013 — and they will continue to do so for years to come. Not only is Brooklyn without a first-round pick this season, but they don't have control of a first rounder for the next three years. For a franchise in full rebuild mode without the ability to draft a potential superstar from the lottery, Brooklyn's future is bleak.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unexpected\n\nCurrent record: 30-27 (seventh in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 14th (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: Ninth\n\nTwo of the Hornets' top three players (Al Jefferson and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist) have combined to play 30 games this season, yet Charlotte has conjured up enough for a seventh place spot in the East. Kidd-Gilchrist is done for the season (torn labrum) and Jefferson returned recently (knee surgery), but it's been the play of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum that has kept the Hornets alive in the playoff race. Come April, a team that had 33 wins last season figures to be right in the mix.\n\nChicago Bulls: Depleted\n\nCurrent record: 30-27 (eighth in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 26th\n\nDefensive rank: 12th\n\nThe Bulls are limping into the postseason ... literally, with leading scorer Jimmy Butler (knee; two to three weeks), versatile power forward Nikola Mirotic (hematoma; two to three weeks), and Joakim Noah (shoulder surgery; likely out for season) all sidelined. As an Eastern Conference contender heading into the season, Chicago sits in eighth place, while wins in the increasingly congested Eastern Conference are becoming more valuable than ever.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: Alone\n\nCurrent record: 41-16 (first in East)\n\nOffensive rank: Fourth\n\nDefensive rank: Eighth\n\nExcept for a slight hiccup in the early-season standings in which the Cavaliers were briefly jumped by both the Bulls and Heat for first place, Cleveland has held a commanding lead of the East's top spot for the majority of the season. The Raptors gained ground with their most recent win over the Cavs on Friday night, but with eyes set firmly on another Finals trip, Cleveland doesn't figure to finish the season in any position but the top, as the rest of the Eastern Conference continue to jockey for position in the standings.\n\nDallas Mavericks: Surprising\n\nCurrent record: 31-28 (sixth in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Ninth\n\nDefensive rank: 17th\n\nThere was just a glimmer of hope for a postseason appearance from Dallas as the season began. Father Time was lurking as Dirk Nowitzki entered his 18th season; Questions surrounded the new acquisitions of Wesley Matthews (ruptured achilles), Deron Williams (age) and Zaza Pachulia (downgrade); Defensive anchor Tyson Chandler left for Phoenix and scoring guard Monta Ellis left for Indiana; Elite center DeAndre Jordan was almost grabbed in free agency ... the list goes on. All signs pointed to a lost season for the Mavs. But yet somehow, they have overcome the obstacles to remain in playoff contention as one of the bigger surprises this season.\n\nDenver Nuggets: Unidentified\n\nCurrent record: 23-36 (12th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 21st (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: 22nd\n\nWith marquee wins against the Warriors, Trail Blazers, Clippers, and Raptors (twice) but ugly losses to the Timberwolves, Suns (twice), Pelicans, and Bucks — Denver has struggled to find a true identity this season. Rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay has been given the keys to the franchise, while Will Barton, Danilo Gallinari, and Nikola Jokic provide the only starpower for a team severely lacking in that category. While the future may look promising, the present remains in limbo.\n\nDetroit Pistons: Hungry\n\nCurrent record: 29-29 (ninth in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 20th\n\nDefensive rank: 11th\n\nDetroit was one of the biggest winners at the trade deadline, sending away backup point guard Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova for a young, athletic forward in Tobias Harris from Orlando, who — if everything falls into place — might just be able to push Detroit over the playoff hump. With Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond both in the midst of career years, the Pistons are eager to see the postseason for the first time since 2009.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Important\n\nCurrent record: 52-5 (first in West)\n\nOffensive rank: First\n\nDefensive rank: Fourth\n\nDominant. The Warriors have blown some of the NBA's top teams out of the water this season, such as the Cavaliers (132-98), Bulls (125-94), Spurs (120-90) and Mavericks (127-107).\n\nUnforgettable. Really ... will anybody forget this team?\n\nHistoric. First, it was the record-breaking 16-0 start to the season. Second, they became the fastest team in league history to reach 50 wins, needing 55 games. Next up: 73 wins, surpassing the 1995-96 Bulls record-breaking 72-win season.\n\nBut while these words adequately describe the NBA's top franchise, the most important word is just that: important. The Warriors play a rare and exciting brand of basketball, and it appeals to the masses. They're a team that people love to love, and league popularity is skyrocketing as a result.\n\nHouston Rockets: Disappointing\n\nRecord: 29-29 (eighth in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Eighth\n\nDefensive rank: 24th (tie)\n\nAfter finishing last season with the most wins since the Hakeem Olajuwon days in the mid-1990s, the Rockets appeared destined for another season as a title contender. That destiny took a turn for the worse after limping out of the starting gate to an 0-3 and then 4-7 start. Coach Kevin McHale — the same coach who led them to the Western Conference Finals just a season before — was prematurely let go, and the Rockets proceeded into a downward spiral. Whether they pull through and hang on to playoff contention, their season will be nothing less than a disappointment, barring some sort abrupt of unforeseen turnaround.\n\nIndiana Pacers: Rejuvenated\n\nCurrent record: 31-27 (sixth in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 23rd\n\nDefensive rank: Second\n\nAfter falling short of a postseason trip last year, Indiana has returned with guns blazing. Paul George is in top form after the leg injury that forced him to sit out all but the final six games last season, while Indiana's combination of an upgraded offense and stout defense puts them in the Eastern Conference playoff mix. From a 97.3 (24th) points per game average to 102.4 (t-13th), as well as a pace of 95.5 (19th) up to 99.6 (eighth), the Pacers have adjusted to a modernized style of play without sacrificing on the defensive end.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Nearby\n\nCurrent record: 38-20 (fourth in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Fifth (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: Sixth (tie)\n\nThe Clippers have been the odd man out behind the Warriors, Spurs, and Thunder at the top of the West, but still pose one of the biggest threats to make a Finals run. They are 21-7 since losing star forward Blake Griffin (hand), who plans to return at some point this season. With Griffin back in the lineup, the recent upgrade at small forward with the acquisition of Jeff Green, and the continued leadership of elite point guard Chris Paul — the Western Conference playoffs are something you won't want to miss.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: Farewell\n\nCurrent record: 11-49 (15th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 29th\n\nDefensive rank: 30th\n\nThe Lakers have the second worst record in the NBA, have won two games this month, and rank 29th in the league in point differential and 30th in field goal percentage. But their continued struggles have been overshadowed by one thing: the retirement of Kobe Bryant. After announcing in late November that this will be his final season, all eyes shifted from the lowly Lakers to the Black Mamba, and that's where they will stay until the clock strikes midnight on his storied career come April 13.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: Relentless\n\nCurrent record: 34-23 (fifth in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 16th\n\nDefensive rank: 15th\n\nWith a starting lineup average age of 29: they're old. Ranked 27th with an average pace of 95.3: they're behind the times. With a 10-19 record against current playoff teams: they're unproven. Despite all of this, the Grizzlies just won't go away. While the recent news that Marc Gasol will miss the remainder of the season because of foot surgery, the Grizzlies — currently in fifth place in the West and winners of seven of their last 10 — appear to be playoff bound for the sixth straight year.\n\nMiami Heat: Almost\n\nCurrent record: 32-25 (fourth in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 21st (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: Sixth (tie)\n\nWith two All-Star starters, the NBA's top rim protector, an athletic and defensive-minded sound rookie, and a versatile veteran on the wing, Miami's potential runs deep. But nevertheless, their rollercoaster ride of a season continues and their future remains uncertain. Until all of their pieces effectively fit together, the odds of a run into the depths of the Eastern Conference playoffs are slim, especially if Chris Bosh (blood clot) is forced to miss the remainder of the season.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Lost\n\nCurrent record: 24-34 (12th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 24th\n\nDefensive rank: 21st\n\nAs one of the NBA's youngest teams, a sixth seed in the playoffs, and the offseason acquisition of Greg Monroe, the Bucks came into their 2015-16 season with playoff aspirations. Those aspirations quickly came to a halt. They haven't been above .500 since Nov. 7 when they were 4-3, and at six and a half games out of eighth place and the postseason window closing quickly, a playoff appearance has become more of a dream than a reality for Milwaukee this season.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: Inexperienced\n\nCurrent record: 18-40 (13th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 12th (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: 27th (tie)\n\nSeven of the 15 players on the T'Wolves roster are 25-years-old or younger. Of those players, three are bonafide starters (Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, and Karl-Anthony Towns), while two others (Zach LaVine and Shabazz Muhammad) see 20 or more minutes on the floor each game. While the late, great coach Flip Saunders surrounded those youngsters with seasoned veterans like Kevin Garnett, Tayshaun Prince, and Andre Miller — the T'Wolves are simply too young and inexperienced to have immediate success.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: Subpar\n\nCurrent record: 23-34 (11th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 11th\n\nDefensive rank: 27th (tie)\n\nAs the season was set to begin, the Pelicans looked to have a promising future ahead. With Anthony Davis as the league's top up-and-coming superstar, a potentially healthy backcourt of Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, and a new coach in Alvin Gentry poised to bring a high-powered offense to New Orleans — what could go wrong? Apparently, a lot. The Pels lost 11 of their first 12 games at the start of the season, and have been making up for lost ground ever since, still five and a half games out of the postseason.\n\nNew York Knicks: Porzingis\n\nCurrent record: 25-35 (12th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 18th\n\nDefensive rank: 20th\n\nOf all the storylines that have come and gone in the Big Apple this season, one has overshadowed them all: Kristaps Porzingis. The Knicks struck gold with a draft day gamble on the 7-3 Latvian, who has since turned into a rookie sensation and a New York City icon. As for team success, there hasn't been much of it. The Knicks have fallen into a funk, and a shot at the postseason is becoming slimmer by the day, as they trail the eighth place Bulls by six and a half games.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Dynamic\n\nCurrent record: 41-17 (third in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Second\n\nDefensive rank: 13th\n\nDynamic, as in the duo of NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. No other team in the league is privileged enough to send out two legitimate MVP candidates each night, which makes the two-headed monster of Durant and Westbrook is a duo as dynamic as they come. Come playoff time, the tandem will surely give trouble to whichever teams step in their way, regardless of the Thunder's occasional lapse on the defensive end.\n\nOrlando Magic: Deceptive\n\nCurrent record: 25-32 (11th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 25th\n\nDefensive rank: 16th\n\nRemember New Years Eve, when the Magic were 19-13, held the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference, and won seven of their last 10? Well, when the ball dropped and the calendars turned, so did their fortune. Orlando lost 13 of their 14 games to start out 2016, and have fallen five games out of eighth place as a result. There's only room for a select few teams in the Eastern Conference cluster, and the Magic just don't fit the bill.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Yikes\n\nCurrent record: 8-50 (15th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 30th\n\nDefensive rank: 23rd\n\nAfter falling to 0-18 early in the season and tying the worst start of all-time (2009-10 New Jersey Nets), there wasn't much that could be done to salvage an already doomed season. While they're pretty much in the clear for being remembered as the worst team in NBA history as far as wins and losses are concerned, that's not exactly something to write home about. With losing streaks coming a dime a dozen, it's been another disastrous season in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nPhoenix Suns: Empty\n\nCurrent record: 14-44 (14th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 28th\n\nDefensive rank: 29th\n\nRemember when the Suns were 6-4 to start the season, with a backcourt tandem of Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight playing the best basketball of their careers, a promising coach in Jeff Hornacek, and a solid third option in Markieff Morris? Yeah, so does P.J. Tucker. With Bledsoe (knee) done for the season, Knight (groin) out indefinitely, Hornacek fired, and Morris traded to Washington, Tucker deemed himself \"the Last of the Mohicans,\" per the Arizona Republic. The 30-year-old forward is the only player left since the start of the 2012-13 season, as the Suns continue to clean house and sink to the bottom of the barrel in a lottery-bound season.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: Transcendent\n\nCurrent record: 30-28 (seventh in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Seventh\n\nDefensive rank: 19th\n\nAfter losing four of their five starters from the season before, Damian Lillard and the Blazers appeared doomed from the get-go, with our 23-59 preseason projection falling on the generous side. Well, the Blazers have proven just about everyone wrong.\n\nThey sit comfortably in sixth place in the West as winners of 11 of their past 12 games. Lillard continues to be one of the NBA's top point guards despite his All-Star snub, while Most Improved Player Award frontrunner C.J. McCollum has stepped up to become the second half of one of the league's top backcourts. If they continue to play at their current level, it's not a matter of if they'll make the playoffs, but a matter of how far they'll go.\n\nSacramento Kings: Frustrating\n\nCurrent record: 24-33 (10th in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 14th (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: 24th (tie)\n\nWhat do you get when you combine the NBA's assists leader, the fourth-leading scorer, a versatile and athletic small forward, and a Hall of Fame Coach? Apparently, a 24-33 record that's good enough for a first class ticket home after the 82nd game. At least, that's the case for Sacramento, a team in the midst of yet another disappointing season. Looking at the glass half full, they're on pace to eclipse the 30-win mark for the first time since 2008.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Quiet\n\nCurrent record: 49-9 (second in West)\n\nOffensive rank: Third\n\nDefensive rank: First\n\nBehind all of the glitz and glammer in the Golden State, the Spurs are quietly lurking in the shadows, ready to do what they do best: win. In the midst of a historical season of their own, San Antonio's winning percentage of 84.5% would put them as the third best team in NBA history if the season ended today. They have the NBA's best defense (92.4 points per game), point differential (+12.7), and if Stephen Curry wasn't running away with the MVP in historic fashion, Kawhi Leonard would be next in line.\n\nToronto Raptors: Contenders\n\nCurrent record: 39-18 (second in East)\n\nOffensive rank: Fifth (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: 10th\n\nThe Raptors were unexpectedly swept by the Wizards in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season, and have returned with a vengeance thanks to their high-octane backcourt of All-Star guards Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan. Both are putting together the best seasons of their careers, leading the Raptors to the second-place spot in the East, threatening the Cavaliers for a shot at the Eastern Conference crown.\n\nUtah Jazz: Persistent\n\nCurrent record: 28-29 (ninth in West)\n\nOffensive rank: 12th (tie)\n\nDefensive rank: 14th\n\nThe Jazz have flirted with the eighth and ninth spots in the West for the entire season. Gordon Hayward is having a career year, and Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert continue to be one of the league's top big man duos when healthy. But if they can't escape the threshold between eighth and ninth place, the only difference between the two would be an extra four — maybe five — games once the regular season concludes.\n\nWashington Wizards: Underperforming\n\nCurrent record: 27-30 (10th in East)\n\nOffensive rank: 19th\n\nDefensive rank: 18th\n\nWith a healthy John Wall and Bradley Beal as one of the league's top backcourts, versatile forwards Otto Porter and Jared Dudley, and one of the most up-tempo offenses in the league — this was the year that Washington was expected to break through the barrier after suffering Eastern Conference semifinals exits two seasons in a row. That plan hasn't come to fruition. Despite Wall's 19.8 points (career high), 9.8 assists (second highest), and 4.7 rebounds (career high), Washington remains out of playoff contention, and are running out of time to turn preseason expectations into reality."
