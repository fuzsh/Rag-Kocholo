        "text": "MILWAUKEE — The Celtics have a new addition for tonight’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Green signed forward Kevinn Pinkney from the Bakersfield Jam of the NBDL to a 10-day contract.\n\nThat will boost Doc Rivers’ player allotment to nine tonight as neither Paul Pierce (left elbow) nor Al Jefferson (bruised left knee) made the trip with the team.\n\nPinkney, who will wear No. 51, arrived in Milwaukee at 11 p.m. last night and joined the team for its shootaround this morning at the Bradley Center, although he had to sit and watch the first portion of the session while the Celtics waited for league approval on his signing. Boston needed a waiver to sign the 6-10 forward because it was already at the 15-man roster limit.\n\nThe 23-year-old was averaging 18.7 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the D-League. He’ll help out the Celtics’ injury depleted frontcourt, which took another hit yesterday when Jefferson reaggravated his left knee. Jefferson, who had banged up the knee against the Charlotte Bobcats on March 21, knocked knees with Ryan Gomes in practice.\n\n“It just kind of made some urgency maybe to do something,” said Celtics executive director of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who did make the trip with the team. “We’re still looking at some players. We followed Kevinn and his progress.”\n\nAinge said the Celtics will take it day by day with Jefferson, when asked if Big Al could be shut down for the remainder of the season.\n\n“Al’s hungry to play,” said Ainge. “There was a little limp in his gate yesterday and it was sore and he complained to the trainer and it’s not worth it right now to risk any further injury.”\n\nRivers said that Jefferson would undergo testing on the knee. “Probably, in the next day or two,” he said.\n\n— In further injury news, Ainge said that Pierce recently had MRIs on his left elbow and left foot and isn’t likely to play later this week against the Miami Heat or the Indiana Pacers. Rivers had previously said that Pierce could play on Friday at home against the Heat.\n\n“I don’t know the results of the MRI, but I do think that Paul still has some swelling in his elbow,” said Ainge “We left him at home yesterday and he probably won’t play this weekend. I’m not saying that finally, but I don’t think he’s playing this weekend.”\n\nHowever, Ainge stopped short of saying Pierce was done for the season.\n\n“I think Paul still wants to play some games. That’s what I love about Paul, but I got the word from Dr. [Brian] McKeon yesterday that he thought he should not play [this week].”"
