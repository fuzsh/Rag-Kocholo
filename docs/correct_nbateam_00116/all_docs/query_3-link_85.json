Kurt is trusting me to let him know if I’m in any pain or not.”\n\nJefferson, battling back from major knee surgery in February, sat out the Wolves’ final three preseason games and did not practice last week. He was diagnosed with Achilles’ tendinitis, prompting Rambis to be cautious with Jefferson’s playing time tonight.\n\nAfter being told by reporters Monday that Rambis was planning to monitor his minutes, Jefferson spoke with Rambis to get a clarification. After Tuesday’s practice, Rambis seemed unsure if he would limit Jefferson.\n\n“He looked great,” Rambis said Tuesday. “He did everything in practice and seemed to be running fine. We’ll see how he is in the morning.”\n\nThe Wolves have a one-hour shootaround practice scheduled this morning.\n\nFlynn, Ellington ailing: Rambis will determine the status of rookie guards Jonny Flynn and Wayne Ellington, out the past two days with the flu, after watching them in the shootaround.\n\nRambis said he doesn’t have a policy against using players who don’t practice.\n\n“That’s more of a case with injuries,” Rambis said. “If Jonny and Wayne are OK, I see no reason why they wouldn’t play.”\n\nFlynn and Ellington both told Rambis on Tuesday that they were feeling better.\n\nPlaying time for Jawai? Rambis said he hopes to give a few minutes tonight to forward Nathan Jawai, acquired last week in a trade with Dallas. The 6-foot-10, 280-pound Jawai still is learning the offense and defense.\n\nIf it were up to Jefferson, Jawai would get significant playing time.\n\n“The guy’s a beast,” Jefferson said after battling him in practice. “I’m sure glad he’s on my team.”\n\nBriefly: About 2,000 tickets are available for tonight’s game. Capacity for Target Center is 19,356. The Wolves had no sellouts last season.\n\nThe Wolves need to place one more player on the inactive list for tonight’s game to reach the 12-player maximum. Kevin Love (broken hand) and Mark Blount are certain to be inactive. Blount is not with the Wolves but remains on the roster until he signs with another team. Jawai or guard Jason Hart likely will be the third inactive player.\n\nPeople who work near Target Center will be treated to free breakfast snacks outside the arena this morning by the Timberwolves Dance Team, mascot Crunch and club employees. The breakfast is part of tip-off festivities for the season opener. Breakfast snacks, including doughnuts and coffee, will be distributed to the public from 6 to 9 outside the main entrance on First Avenue.\n\nOriginally Published: October 26, 2009 at 11:01 p.m."
