        "text": "Mattahunt Community Center Youth to Audition for FSN FanCaster Program\n\nJefferson and FSN to Donate Much Needed Basketball Equipment\n\nBURLINGTON, MA â€“ The programs and facilities run by Boston Centers for Youth and Families (BCYF) are key components of Mayor Thomas M. Menino's effort to provide a safe after-school environment for Boston's youth. To assist the city in this effort, Boston Celtics forward Al Jefferson and FSN New England will visit the Mattahunt Community Center in Mattapan on March 27, to promote the importance of community centers and to talk to middle and high school students about sports and entertainment career opportunities.\n\nAttending the event will be middle and high school students from the Mattahunt, Mildred Avenue, and Gallivan Community Centers, area AAU basketball teams, and members of the \"Mattahunt Steppers\" Dance Troupe. In addition to Jefferson, students will also hear from FSN on-air personalities Greg Dickerson, Gary Tanguay and Mattapan native, former Celtic and current FSN NBA analyst Dana Barros.\n\n\"The FanCaster program is a great way to show our young people that there are careers in sports that aren't dependent on athletic excellence,\" said Robert Lewis, Jr., Executive Director of Boston Centers for Youth & Families. \"On behalf of Mayor Thomas M. Menino, I want to thank FSN for bringing the program to the Mattahunt and Al Jefferson for giving the center this great new sports equipment.\"\n\nThe visit is part of FSN New England's FanCaster program, which offers students from all over the region the opportunity to appear on camera during a Celtics telecast. During the event, FSN New England will audition students for its final FanCaster spot of the 2005-06 season.\n\n\"Boston Centers for Youth and Families are a critical resource for Boston's youth and we are proud to be here with Al Jefferson to provide support,\" said Nancy Larkin, FSN New England vice president of marketing and development. \"The FanCaster program has generated hundreds of submissions from around the region, but we are being proactive in seeking submissions from Boston. We are excited to talk directly to kids about the real and achievable careers that are available to them in the sports industry.\"\n\nJust two years removed from Prentiss High School in Prentiss, Mississippi, Jefferson is a rising star in the NBA. Jefferson has dedicated extensive time working with youth at Boys & Girls Clubs in Mississippi and he is extending that outreach to youth in Greater Boston. In conjunction with his visit, Jefferson and FSN will donate much needed basketball equipment, including basketballs and backboards for the Mattahunt Community Center's after-school and summer athletic programs.\n\n\"It wasn't that long ago that I was playing on courts just like these and to have the chance to work with FSN to fix up the court and get the kids some new equipment, well, that's pretty cool for me, said Jefferson.\n\nThe Mattahunt Community Center event tips off at 2 p.m. with open auditions for FSN's FanCaster program. Students who wish to audition will be taped on-camera reading a short script. FSN will select one student from the auditions and that student will attend the final Boston Celtics game on April 19, to tape an on-camera introduction to the Celtics \"Heroes Among Us\". During each home game, the Celtics honor a community hero on the parquet floor, and FSN New England uses the taped FanCaster intro during its half-time show to introduce viewers to the Celtics Hero.\n\nAbout Boston Centers for Youth and Families\n\nBoston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) is Boston's largest youth and human service agency. A City of Boston department under Mayor Thomas M. Menino, BCYF oversees 46 facilities including 21 pools and one beach. Each community center facility offers a variety of educational, recreational and social programming for people of all ages. Through the input of local voluntary advisory councils, BCYF centers' programs reflect the needs and concerns of our neighborhoods."
