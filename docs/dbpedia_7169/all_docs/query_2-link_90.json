        "text": "Many of the objects in the everyday world around us are squidgy when squashed, flow easily, or are very sensitive to changes in temperature. These sorts of materials – ranging from paint to frogspawn, from yoghurt to snot – fall into the category of ‘soft matter’: materials whose dynamics are governed by timescales of seconds rather than hugely longer or shorter times.\n\nThe study of these systems, which are often complex and heterogeneous, grew out of the more traditional field of condensed matter physics. Whereas condensed matter physicists of the early-mid twentieth century traditionally studied in minute detail the properties of simple, one-phase materials such as copper or silicon, as soft matter grew as a discipline the range of material types studied expanded enormously.\n\nThere are two towering figures, both theoretical physicists, who are usually identified with the birth of this new field: Pierre Gilles de Gennes and Sir Sam Edwards. Both were trained as conventional theorists, both saw the richness of the newer materials and how the mathematical tools they were familiar with could be taken over to the study of this new class of materials.\n\nIt was the Frenchman de Gennes who won the 1991 Nobel Prize for this work with a citation that read “for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers”. But his friend and friendly rival the Welshman Sir Sam Edwards, who died last week at the age of 87, was equally active and influential; many felt he was unlucky not to share the prize.\n\nSir Sam was born and brought up in Swansea and his Welsh roots were very important to him. A grammar school boy, he won a scholarship to Cambridge to study mathematics at Gonville and Caius College. His PhD work was carried out at Harvard under Julian Schwinger in quantum field theory before he returned to Manchester University. At Manchester he got to know the work of local chemists Geoffrey Gee and Sir Geoffrey Allen amongst others and over time he began to appreciate how the tools he had developed, notably the use of Feynmann diagrams and path integral methods familiar in quantum field theory, could actually be carried over to systems which exhibited large fluctuations, such as polymers.\n\nPolymers (also known as macromolecules) are long-chain molecules which form the basis of many familiar objects. Gee himself was particularly interested in rubber, one such polymeric material, and this was the area which Sam began to explore with him. Unlike ‘hard’ materials, the molecules in such soft matter can undergo large (on the lengthscale of the molecule) movements around some equilibrium position. The range of such systems that Sam turned his attention to constantly expanded.\n\nIn the early 1970’s he moved to the University of Cambridge, but his research was somewhat slowed down during 1973–1977 when he was Chairman of the Science Research Council (SRC), the predecessor of two of the current research councils. Nevertheless he still kept up a formidable rate of output, using the Cambridge to London train journeys as an opportunity to spend time talking with his research students (whose fares he would naturally pay) about their research projects.\n\nA key collaborator during this period was Masao Doi from Japan, with whom he wrote a seminal series of papers on polymer flow.\n\nThe long chain nature of polymers means that the way they slide past each other to permit deformation and flow is totally different from the cases of atomic materials or those containing small molecules comprising only a handful of atoms. De Gennes and Sir Sam had worked out the ideas underpinning this motion, known as ‘reptation’ because of the similarity between such sliding motion of the chains and the way snakes move, in various situations.\n\nThe Doi-Edwards papers explored how this led to polymer viscoelasticity, a quantity which means the solution is neither purely elastic nor purely viscous. To understand viscoelasticity, think of something like hair gel or wallpaper paste: the material can be pulled and stretched - the elastic bit - but will also flow over time, which is the viscous component. Their theory of polymer solutions meant a rigorous theoretical framework was constructed that allowed, for instance, the change in behaviour as the concentration of polymer chains was increased to be quantified.\n\nReturning full time to Cambridge after his time at the SRC he sought to expand the activities at the Cavendish from the theoretical work so far done to include an experimental effort. First Jacob Klein was appointed and, on his departure to Israel, I took over the reins of the nascent polymer activity.\n\nAt this time Edwards was seeking to expand the research from the synthetic polymers familiar to the industrial world of companies such as ICI, with whom he had strong links, to more esoteric areas such as food. I well remember, immediately before I joined the Cavendish as a young research fellow, Sam taking me out to dinner – as far as he was concerned, dinners were always a good place for serious conversation, ideally accompanied by good wine – and trying to convince me that food itself was a suitable material for study. At the time I could not see how my experience looking at the failure properties of things like Perspex could possibly be relevant, but over time I realised (possibly for the first time but most certainly not for the last) how wise and percipient Sam was. Of course, the mechanical properties of Cheesy Wotsits may not look like physics at first sight, and was certainly not seen as such by some of our Cavendish colleagues, but as Sam always saw there is much universality in physics and some of the most fascinating concepts turn up in unlikely places.\n\nOver time, from the 1980’s onwards, Sam built up a flourishing group of both theorists and experimentalists in the field. The repertoire of materials under study expanded to include other non-traditional systems (for a physicist) such as cement, carrots (the topic of the only article - a paper at a conference - he and I co-authored), powders and foams as well as rubbers and more conventional polymer systems. The field was burgeoning around the world and Sam’s former students and collaborators helped to drive that forward.\n\nOne should also remember the man and not just the physicist. Sam was wise, as I said above, shrewd, kind, a risk-taker, a bon viveur and a leader. His contacts across the academic world but also into industry enabled many new networks to be built. At the time he was at the SRC he backed the idea of a neutron source for research; the facility at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory he helped to establish still going to this day.\n\nHe was a non-executive director for various companies and also was de facto Chief Scientific Officer at the Ministry of Defence for a while. To those of us who had the privilege to know him he was an inspiration and a committed supporter of the young – whom he treated equally and with as much (if not more) enthusiasm as a fully-fledged professor. He was an excellent dinner companion, full of witty stories about the great and good he had tangled with. But above all he was inspirational in the way he led the field and shared his knowledge and bounty so freely.\n\nHe will be hugely missed as a towering figure in the field of soft matter."
