Fourier analysis, named after Joseph Fourier, addresses classically commutative harmonic analysis. The modern development of Fourier analysis during XXth century has explored the generalization of Fourier and Fourier-Plancherel formula for non-commutative harmonic analysis, applied to locally compact non-Abelian groups. In parallel, the theory of coherent states and wavelets has been generalized over Lie groups (by associating coherent states to group representations that are square integrable over a homogeneous space). The name of Joseph Fourier is also inseparable from the study of mathematics of heat. Modern research on Heat equation explores geometric extension of classical diffusion equation on Riemannian, sub-Riemannian manifolds, and Lie groups. The heat equation for a general volume form that not necessarily coincides with the Riemannian one is useful in sub-Riemannian geometry, where a canonical volume only exists in certain cases. A new geometric theory of heat is emerging by applying geometric mechanics tools extended for statistical mechanics, for example, the Lie groups thermodynamics.

Exact analytic designs and solutions are known in the 2D case, where they have been obtained using Fourier transform on S E ( 2 ) . Here, we extend these approaches to 3D using Fourier transform on the Lie group S E ( 3 ) of rigid body motions. More precisely, we define the homogeneous space of 3D positions and orientations R 3 ⋊ S 2 : = S E ( 3 ) / ( { 0 } × S O ( 2 ) ) as the quotient in S E ( 3 ) . In our construction, two group elements are equivalent if they are equal up to a rotation around the reference axis. On this quotient, we design a specific Fourier transform. We apply this Fourier transform to derive new exact solutions to Fokker–Planck PDEs of α -stable Lévy processes on R 3 ⋊ S 2 . This reduces classical analysis computations and provides an explicit algebraic spectral decomposition of the solutions. We compare the exact probability kernel for α = 1 (the diffusion kernel) to the kernel for α = 1 2 (the Poisson kernel). We set up stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for the Lévy processes on the quotient and derive corresponding Monte-Carlo methods. We verified that the exact probability kernels arise as the limit of the Monte-Carlo approximations.

Provided by the discrete transforms, inherent interpolation methods are formulated. The four generated classes of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials generalize the formation of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second and fourth kinds. Continuous orthogonality relations of the polynomials together with the inherent weight functions are deduced. Sixteen cubature rules, including the four Gaussian, are produced by the related discrete transforms. For the three-dimensional case, interpolation tests, unitary transform matrices and recursive algorithms for calculation of the polynomials are presented.

More recently it has been shown how the symplectization of contact manifolds provides a new vantage point; enabling, among other things, to switch easily between the energy and entropy representations of a thermodynamic system. In the present paper, this is continued towards the global geometric definition of a degenerate Riemannian metric on the homogeneous Lagrangian submanifold describing the state properties, which is overarching the locally-defined metrics of Weinhold and Ruppeiner. Next, a geometric formulation is given of non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes, in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics defined by Hamiltonian functions that are homogeneous of degree one in the co-extensive variables and zero on the homogeneous Lagrangian submanifold. The correspondence between objects in contact geometry and their homogeneous counterparts in symplectic geometry, is extended to the definition of port-thermodynamic systems and the formulation of interconnection ports. The resulting geometric framework is illustrated on a number of simple examples, already indicating its potential for analysis and control.

In the present work we give further evidence that the Born–Jordan rule is the correct quantization scheme for quantum mechanics. For this purpose we use correct short-time approximations to the action functional, initially due to Makri and Miller, and show that these lead to the desired quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.

This extended model could be used for small data analytics and machine learning on Lie groups. Souriau geometric theory of heat is well adapted to describe density of probability (maximum entropy Gibbs density) of data living on groups or on homogeneous manifolds. For small data analytics (rarified gases, sparse statistical surveys, …), the density of maximum entropy should consider higher order moments constraints (Gibbs density is not only defined by first moment but fluctuations request 2nd order and higher moments) as introduced by Ingarden. We use a poly-sympletic model introduced by Christian Günther, replacing the symplectic form by a vector-valued form. The poly-symplectic approach generalizes the Noether theorem, the existence of moment mappings, the Lie algebra structure of the space of currents, the (non-)equivariant cohomology and the classification of G-homogeneous systems. The formalism is covariant, i.e., no special coordinates or coordinate systems on the parameter space are used to construct the Hamiltonian equations. We underline the contextures of these models, and the process to build these generic structures. We also introduce a more synthetic Koszul definition of Fisher Metric, based on the Souriau model, that we name Souriau-Fisher metric. This Lie groups thermodynamics is the bedrock for Lie group machine learning providing a full covariant maximum entropy Gibbs density based on representation theory (symplectic structure of coadjoint orbits for Souriau non-equivariant model associated to a class of co-homology).

The first one shows its experimental side, in what form it occurs, and how we treated it. It is demonstrated that the Guyer-Krumhansl equation can be the next appropriate extension of Fourier’s law for room-temperature phenomena in modeling of heterogeneous materials. The second approach provides an interpretation of generalized heat conduction equations using a simple thermo-mechanical background. Here, Fourier heat conduction is coupled to elasticity via thermal expansion, resulting in a particular generalized heat equation for the temperature field. Both aforementioned approaches show the size dependency of non-Fourier heat conduction. Finally, a third approach is presented, called pseudo-temperature modeling. It is shown that non-Fourier temperature history can be produced by mixing different solutions of Fourier’s law. That kind of explanation indicates the interpretation of underlying heat conduction mechanics behind non-Fourier phenomena.

This can be done in terms of a unified framework based on the use of rigged Hilbert spaces. We find a relation between the universal enveloping algebra of the symmetry groups with the fractional Fourier transform. The results obtained are relevant in quantum mechanics as well as in signal processing as Fourier analysis has a close relation with signal filters. In addition, we introduce some new results concerning a discretized Fourier transform on the circle. We introduce new functions on the circle constructed with the use of Hermite functions with interesting properties under Fourier transformations.

Covariant integral quantization combines operator-valued measure with the symmetry group of the phase space. Covariant means that the quantization map intertwines classical (geometric operation) and quantum (unitary transformations) symmetries. Integral means that we use all resources of integral calculus, in order to implement the method when we apply it to singular functions, or distributions, for which the integral calculus is an essential ingredient. We first review this quantization scheme before revisiting the cases where symmetry covariance is described by the Weyl-Heisenberg group and the affine group respectively, and we emphasize the fundamental role played by Fourier transform in both cases. As an original outcome of our generalisations of the Wigner-Weyl transform, we show that many properties of the Weyl integral quantization, commonly viewed as optimal, are actually shared by a large family of integral quantizations.
