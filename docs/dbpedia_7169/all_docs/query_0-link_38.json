Pierre-Gilles was born in Paris where he graduated from the elite Ecole Normale Superieure school after working in \"neutron scattering and magnetism before moving to the realm of supraconductors and later to liquid crystals.\" He went on to take home the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1991, and was even dubbed the \"Isaac Newton of our time\" by some of the judges. Thankfully, much of his brilliance can still be enjoyed via his 1974 book \"The Physics of Liquid Crystals,\" and while we're sure the context is way over our heads, we can certainly appreciate the end results of his unwearying work.",
