FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES In the footsteps of Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Scientiﬁc excellence Alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure, scientific visitor in the group of Charles Kittel at Berkeley from 1967 to 1971, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes became the Director of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles [Graduate School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry] in 1976, professor at the Collège de France, and eventually was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1991. PGG lately joined the Curie Institute in 2002. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes left us a vast body of achievements. He essentially created the field of soft-matter physics, opening up an area that was viewed by his peers as irrelevant at that time. His enthusiasm and his sense of curiosity led him unceasingly to address issues that were new to him (for instance neurosciences). There is a certain approach to physics that can be characterized as the “de Gennes” style, typified by the conviction that the phenomena observed in everyday life also pose worthwhile scientific problems and challenges – that shall be explained in simple terms and understood by everyone, regardless of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms. His unflagging desire to convey knowledge and share his discoveries impelled Pierre-Gilles de Gennes to teach throughout his life: at the Faculté des Sciences d’Orsay [Orsay School of the Sciences], in primary schools and colleges after receiving his Nobel prize, and at the Collège de France, where he held the condensed-matter physics chair until 2007, the very year when he passed away at the age of 75. The meeting of industrial know-how and academic knowledge For Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, the essential thing was to breach the barrier separating industrial research from basic Science. PGG was able to maintain links with industrial engineers, based on intellectual stimulation and exchanges, supported by a truly egalitarian approach. His own researches into aquaplaning and emulsions were heavily influenced and driven by his industrial experience. As he himself said, “Both sides have everything to gain!”. The discoveries of Pierre- Gilles de Gennes contributed toward numerous industrial innovations, such as the role played by polymerization processes in the plastics industry, or the mastery of textures and the release of active ingredients in shampoos or detergents, and the assisted recovery of petroleum. The convictions held by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes include the need for concerted action, for a dialog, and for the creation of two-way channels between the academic world and the industrial world. In his own words, “a proper national policy would consist of harmonizing both spheres, so that industrialists will be able to delegate the problems that they themselves cannot address, because of the extremely long timeframes of those issues.” p. 4\n\n5. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Inspired every day by scientific interdisciplinarity, and with a commitment to major societal missions (the symbiotic cooperation of basic and industrial research, the dissemination of scientific progresses in the fields of health, the environmentally concerned sustainable development, and the transmission of knowledge), Pierre-Gilles de Gennes left a mark on science, business, and society. It was with the goal of enshrining his missions within the continuation of the activities of this great servant of science that the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research was created. The convergence of scientiﬁc disciplines “The frontiers between great empires are often populated by the most interesting peoples. Similarly, the interfaces between two blocks of matter cause the most unexpected effects.” Pierre-Gilles de Gennes crossed the boundaries of numerous different scientific domains – or, in other words, he took advantage of those boundaries in order to make them more fruitful and to derive from them the full measure of their substance and their potential. He explo- red the physics of condensed matter, the chemistry of polymers, and the universe of plastics – which, he was fond of saying, represented an ideal marriage between physics and chemistry. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes was an explorer: a frontierman who never lost his enthusiasm, even while working at the Curie Institute on the physico-chemical foundations of the biology of the brain. Innovation within start-up ventures “The most fruitful industrial research is being done at small start-up ventures, where life is exciting but difficult. I love this example of stubborn, penniless experimenters. Small high-tech companies, which embody the hopes for our future, thrive on these kinds of people.” The goal of Pierre-Gilles de Gennes was to prevent the drain of technological projects away from their place of birth and to create conditions that would encourage the emergence of industrial applications from the locus of initial discovery, the academic laboratories. For him, helping innovative young companies take off, thanks to the convergence of skills and resources, was the ideal way to concretize the inherent potential of Research. p. 5\n\n6. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES A strategy... At a time when the ability to discover, invent, and transform knowledge into applications is becoming globalized, more than ever the modern world needs technological breakthroughs and major innovations in order to maintain a sustainable development, create value for inves- tors, bring new resource-preservation solutions to light, and fight against the great diseases that plague humanity. It was within this setting that the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research was created in March of 2007. And it is in this spirit that the Foundation now invites innovative businesses to create the conditions for innovation breakthrough in partnership with the research laboratories within its network. Through the meeting of industrial know-how and academic research Through the creation of new research topics and new sources of inspiration Through the simplification of the administrative management of joint public-private projects Through the responsiveness and flexibility provided for individual, collective, academic, and industrial initiatives The Foundation is building and enriching its network of private partners (including innovative small and medium-sized businesses, as well as major companies) alongside the laboratories of its founding members. Dedicated to industrialists and academic researchers, the Foundation laun- ches public-private research projects and facilitates the transformation of discoveries into inno- vative applications. Between now and the year 2012, the Foundation will be investing its initial capital of 20 million euros in the financing of research projects undertaken by its laboratories. For industrialists For academic researchers The Foundation: The Foundation: Allows access to a think-tank of extremely Invests 2.5 million euro/year in research projects high-level researchers Facilitates meetings proposed by researchers within the network among potential partners and the creation of Offers an alternative source of inspiration and partnerships Serves as a facilitator for joint challenges: exploring the hard-to-reach scientific research projects Provides security for the area consisting of industrial know-how Proposes acquisition of proofs of concept Offers three working alongside industrial partners Evaluates sequential stages for the secure establishment of and sets up projects in a responsive manner partnerships (see p. 13) p. 6\n\n7. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES The École Normale Supérieure (ENS), the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles (ESPCI), the Institut Curie, the CNRS and the INSERM have built a virtual center of excellence based on An organization interdisciplinarity, exchanges among the institutions and public-private partnerships: a center known as the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research For the determination of its broad guidelines and oversight of their implementation, the Foundation relies on a Board of Directors consisting of representatives of its five founding members, the scientific community, local collective bodies, and civil society. To define its scientific strategy, specify its goals, and evaluate its performance, the Foundation consults its International Science Committee. To manage its activities, the Foundation has established a dual operational entity consisting of an Executive Team and a particularly responsive Steering Committee. As a driving force behind the Foundation’s excellence, this Steering Committee identifies and selects the best opportunities among internal research projects and projects conducted in the form of industrial partnerships.

FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Toward a new model of innovation In the traditional Tech-Transfer model, the industrial partnership is established only downstream for the translation of an “academic innovation” into marketable applications. However, this de- layed dialog between the industrial interests and the publicly funded research activities makes it very unlikely that this type of innovation will find its market. The Foundation by the numbers 140 research teams 1,450 researchers 20 million euros: seed capital 2.5 million euros: pro- prietary funds for projects per year, over a 5-year period 1 to 3 months to validate a research project 3 to 6 months to launch partnerships Less than one month to recruit a researcher p. 8\n\n9. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES The Foundation is refining the traditional model for research enhancement. Its approach converts the meeting between the academic community and the industrial world into a driving force for innovation. Discovery alone cannot lead to innovation. In the model proposed by the Foundation, the upstream combination of the industrial know-how and the knowledge of academic research constitutes a “partnership for discovery” that encourages the transformation of discoveries into innovation breakthroughs, with a greater likelihood that those innovations will find their market. The Foundation’s operations attest to its alternative vision : To open up an avenue for innovative companies, the 4 public founding members and the Curie Institute have installed an executive team with solid experience in small and me- dium-sized companies. The Foundation intent is to use its seed capital between now and the year 2012, and thereafter to ensure its sustainable growth through the implementation of public-private partnerships. The prerequisite for this original approach is the creation of an interface between the locus of discovery and the locus of innovation. The Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research provides this interface between the academic and industrial worlds. For applications in health The Foundation invests in research projects that shall lead to specific breakthroughs in the health field, including mastery of natural and pathological tissue dynamics; new diagnostic tests; medical imaging systems; targeted therapeutic systems; new biotechnologies; new analytical devices; new neurosensory modeling methods; and biomimetic chemistry. p. 9\n\n10. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Responding to business issues Facilitating access to basic research Capitalizing on industrial know-how The laboratories in the Foundation’s network and, more generally, those in the French public Research, include world-class researchers and hold an enviable position in terms of international scientific excellence. They are a primary locus for scientific discoveries. In parallel, an industrial company that has a stock of know-how is the owner of a true asset and a powerful engine for growth through the renewal of its innovations and the enhancement of this asset.

Biol. / Genetics 51,5 26,5 38,3 35 30,8 33 Citation Index - Essential Science Indicators - ISI (1996 - 2006) Within this complex dialog between innovation and discovery, innovation breakthroughs cannot exist without prior discoveries. The meeting of industry and academic research is fertile for this discoveries. The Foundation has set itself the primary task of bringing about this meeting, facilitating and maintaining the dialog between these two worlds, and encouraging (through a drastic administrative simplification) the initiation of research projects in the form of partnerships. The engineer should be able to formalize her/his know-how in order to create new scientific challenges that will be presented to high-level academic researchers. This capitalization of know-how is made possible through access to all of the areas of scientific expertise within the Foundation’s network, while the Foundation itself provides security for the formalization phase by protecting the confidentiality of the information. p. 10\n\n11. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES The Foundation’s natural industrial partners are innovative companies in the health field, which invest in R&D in order to support their growth and the durability of their economic success. They have the courage to stake and to share their know-how, in order to create breakthroughs. Customized offerings For innovative businesses, the Foundation offers multiple levels of partnership and involvement in the Foundation’s life: Its industrial and financial partners are an integral part of the Foundation’s network of labora- tories. Depending on their level of involvement, they can then sponsor or contract for research projects inspired by their own know-how, from the furthest upstream stage down through the proof of concept. Partners then become agents for the beneficial industrial development of a shared discovery, from innovation through market introduction. And in so doing, they build their own ongoing future as innovative businesses.

It means participating, either directly, as an innovative entrepreneur,* or indirectly, as a ﬁnancial partner,** in the genesis of a new culture of innovation and discovery. *Through its know-how , the company contributes to the identification and implementation of new research projects in partnership with the Foundation’s laboratories, and to the industrial implementation of the discoveries. The company benefits from a Research Tax Credit that lowers the cost of equity to 5.6%. **The partner becomes a member of the Foundation’s scientific community; benefits from all of the information generated by the network; supports the Foundation’s numerous activities (international symposia, chairs of excellence, and the establishment of junior teams). As a contributor to a Fondation Reconnue d’Utilité Publique [Foundation of Acknowledged Public Interest], the company enjoys tax-related benefits, in the form of a tax allowance in the amount of 60% of its contribution. p. 11\n\n12. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Building innovation in three stages Support the Foundation and join its network Specifically, the” action partner” supports the Foundation in sponsoring individual events (conferences, seminars, recruiting programs, etc.). Yttrium partners (named after a key element in the field of superconductivity) and Iridium partners (named after an element used in numerous therapeutic applications) participate in the Foundation’s life. They become active members of the Foundation’s research community, with benefits that include access to the extranet platform, recognition in communications media, invitations to internal events, and meetings with the network’s researchers. The Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research offers Iridium partners unrestricted access to five specific value axes that are being developed around the Internet/extranet platform: Talent • The Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research is rooted in an outstanding talent pool that also embraces the human and social sciences, literature, and philosophy. • Thus, the Foundation serves as a bellwether for identifying up-and-coming talents, in conjunction with the vision of its Iridium partners, among the 1,450 researchers, 140 team leaders, 200 post-docs, and 350 young doctoral researchers within its network. Knowledge and • Iridium partners can obtain the assistance and support of scientiﬁc experts for questioning the state of the art in new know-how ﬁelds, or for obtaining a better understanding of development issues. • Iridium partners participate in the knowledge-dissemination activities organized by the Foundation. The partner’s colleagues, as well as the academic researchers within the network, are enrolled as members of the extranet, and have direct access to these events. Ideas • Iridium partners have an ongoing source of innovative concepts to evaluate. • They can obtain, at a very early stage, a full range of opportunities for development and for innovative partnerships. Projects • The ideas and meetings initiated through the Foundation lead to R&D projects in partnership with one or more research teams. Iridium partnership opens a pathway marked out by the Foundation: Upstream validation of the project by the Foundation’s steering committee, clarifying the partnership in terms of the Research Tax Credit (CIR) Simpliﬁcation of the administrative management of public-private projects, through the installation of a single agent or representative for handling the legal aspects and IP issues The security for the acquisition of proofs of concept, through the Foundation’s supervision of the projects. • Each year, ten promising ventures are identiﬁed within the Foundation’s laboratories. These start-ups are naturally attracted to the Foundation’s Iridium partners in order to participate to their growth. A ”label of quality” • Acknowledgment as an Iridium Partner of the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research is a powerful indicator in the world of innovation of innovation activism - which, of course, is displayed at the Foundation’s Internet site. • Iridium partners are mentioned prominent in all broadcast media, at institutional activities, and at all of the Foundation’s events. p. 12\n\n13. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES The Foundation and innovative companies seed innovation in three successives stages: project establishment, active participation to research and development of results... Stage 1: Build research projects: Yttrium and Iridium partners are directly involved in the Foundation’s activities, and engage in dialogue with the Foundation’s researchers in order to conduct research projects in partnership. Stage 2: Participate in research projects The Foundation prepares a provisional budget for the project, and proposes to the Iridium partner: Two possible types of financing • In the form of tax-exempt sponsored research, under the auspices of the discretion granted to foundations that are acknowledged to be in the public interest, or • In the form of contractual joint research that can be included in full under the Research Tax Credit (CIR) assessment. This contract specifies, among other things, the treatment of IP. Optimized management • Founding Members of the Foundation offer a single point of contact for all legal issues and issues relating to the beneficial use of the results of the research projects. • Tax-related matters are optimized, and the handling of intellectual property issues is simplified, through the signing of contracts directly between the industrial partner and the national laboratories, with no additional intermediaries. • Progress reports are submitted through access to the Foundation’s extranet project platform, and are also presented at the milestone and results meetings. This system provides security for the acquisition of proofs of concept. Stage 3: Develop Innovation Although the development of the scientific results for beneficial use can be handled directly by the partners and the public agencies, the Foundation can support and assist the industrialists or academic researchers in the following three instances: For the creation of consortia / The Foundation may provide a locus for the creation of the consortia, including consortia with external French or foreign academic partners, thereby facilitating fundraising or the acquisition of the subsidies that are necessary for the success of the project. Technology transfer / The Foundation assists researchers in the establishment of technology transfers. • The Founding Members appoint a single patent manager, who becomes the Foundation’s partner for the development and beneficial use of the invention. • The Founding Members entrust the pair consisting of the Foundation and the manager with the task of serving as the point of contact with the industrial partners. Support for promising ventures / The Foundation encourages the emergence of innovative start-ups by accompanying them and allowing them to make progress toward technical and/or economic proof of concept, without departing from the fertile environment of its network. p. 13\n\n14. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Laboratories… Laboratories The Foundation brings together the full potential of the research laboratories of the École Normale Supérieure, the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, the Institut Curie to which come to be added those of the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique (IBPC). These laboratories unite scientific excellence over a full range of disciplines: from clinical medicine to theoretical physics, and from chemistry to molecular and cell biology. The École Normale Supérieure is a teaching and research institution. The long tradition of basic research at the ENS ranges from mathematics to the human sciences, via physics, chemistry, and biology. The mission of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Indus- trielles is to train scientific engineers in the areas of physics and chemistry, with a grounding in biology; to develop a world-class research center; and to maintain close links with the industrial world. Thus, the ESPCI holds a position at the heart of a tradition of relations between theoretical and applied science. The Institut Curie combines at a single site France’s largest cancer research center and a hospital that specializes in the treatment of cancer. The Curie Institute includes biologists, chemists, physicists, biostatisticians, and physicians, all working toward the single shared goal of providing diagnostic and therapeutic solutions to human pathologies in general and to cancer in particular. p. 14\n\n15. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Projects The Foundation’s three founding research centers include 140 teams and 1,450 researchers working in all areas of chemistry, physics, biology, and clinical applications. Projects Scientific rigor, quality, and high risk/impact are the primary selection criteria applied to the research programs considered by the Foundation’s steering committee. The Foundation launches only projects that qualify for two out of the three additional criteria : • Inter-institutional, to maximize the synergies of the research laboratories of the ENS, the ESPCI, and the Curie Institute. • Interdisciplinary, to shorten the discovery/innovation cycle, by interfacing physics with biology, chemistry, and clinics. • Public-private, to facilitate the implementation of the scientific partnerships that support the research efforts and the rapid implementation of the innovations. Intermediate Scales for Translational Research The range between macromolecules size and cell or tissue – on the scale from 100 nanometers to 50 microns – is where certain major biological events take place: tumor stability, neural communication, and cell adhesion… The study of all of these events requires a multidisciplinary approach, and is taking on the major challenge of achieving cooperation among very diverse cultures, e.g., those of physicians, biostatisticians, chemists, biologists, and pharmacologists. Over the last 40 years, the Foundation’s teams have developed unique skills in the study and modeling of the events that occur at these so-called “intermediate scales.” These skills place the researchers in an ideal position for a concrete approach to Translational Research, because the “inter- mediate scales” are the locus of most of the causes of failure for standard therapeutic development strategies. These scales may thus make it possible to align animal models with clinical observations. Consequently, the researchers of the Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research are resolutely embracing this field of exploration, which has often been overlooked but which is of the utmost importance for the therapeutic successes of tomorrow. p. 15\n\n16. FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES Developing talents... The Foundation’s researchers 1,450 men and women with broad backgrounds and scientific careers, distributed among the 140 laboratories in the Foundation’s network, constitute a lea- ding international scientific community. These researchers are ready to work with industrial know-how to which they do not currently have access, in order to derive from it the discoveries that will be tomorrow’s wellsprings of innovation. These are the researchers who have the courage to face new challenges by leaving the well-beaten paths of the traditional approach of research. From basic to applied research, from theory to inventions and industrial development for beneficial use, from concepts to therapeutic solutions, the Foundation’s research centers form a unique scientific hub for the creation of international “chairs of excellence,” while welcoming visiting scientists, young researchers, and PhD students.

FONDATION PIERRE-GILLES DE GENNES The Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes for Research organizes scientific conferences, created the PGG International Seminars, and sponsors university summer sessions. Its goal, through these events, is to offer Transmitting the scientific community high-level lectures on the research topics that it addresses, and to strengthen the international scientific scope of its knowledge network. The dissemination of knowledge through scientific events also gives the Foundation’s partner businesses access to the latest progress in their research fields. The DeGennesDays 2008 Held in Paris in May 2008, the De Gennes Days international seminar seek to encourage closer links among different disciplines, including physics, biology, chemistry, biophysics, and biochemis- try. Recent developments in the scientific fields that are most heavily influenced by the work of Pierre-Gilles de Gennes were presented. PGG International Seminars 2008-2009 Translational Research & Cancer www.fondation-pgg.org The purpose of the international seminars sponsored by the Pierre-Gilles de Gennes /events/degennesdays Foundation is to present the state of the art in a given research field, and to contribute to it through a new vision or a novel approach. With the launch of the PGG International Seminars, the Foundation is offering a cycle of multiple conferences in 2008 and 2009, whose goal is to enable a better understanding of translational research in the field of oncology through complementary viewpoints. Translational research aims to bring about cooperation among diverse cultures, and to combine individual approaches that are in a state of constant evolution (including applied mathematics, the physical of wave-matter interaction, molecular biology, and advanced biotechnological systems) with solidly established know-how (including clinical observation, anatomopathology, and technical and regulatory affairs). Thus, the conduct of translational research and the conversion of its findings into specific applications are particularly dependent not only on the sharing of knowledge, but www.trc.fondation-pgg.org also on the union of skills and the creation of public-private partnerships. It is within this context that the Foundation has made an investment in translational research and organized a cycle of meetings. Eight meetings will present, from four different viewpoints (clinical practice, imaging, molecular biology and bioinformatics, and industrial challenges), a multidisciplinary, public-private, and up-to-the-minute vision of translational research in the field of oncology. p. 17\n\n18.
