        "text": "Growth rate fluctuations are dominated by constant noise\n\nTo better understand the observation of a reduction in growth rate noise with cell volume, we used a stochastic mathematical model describing cell growth (see Apppendix 1 and ). This model has a long history of applications outside biology (Cox, 1997; Lo et al., 2011), but it was recently proposed by Pirjol et al., 2017 in the context of cell growth. The model considers that cells on average grow exponentially and describes fluctuations around this mean growth as noise:\n\ndVdt=αV+ναVγ\n\nwhere α is the mean specific growth rate and να is a white noise term. Thanks to the factor Vγ, this equation interpolates the limit cases of ‘additive’ (constant amplitude) fluctuations and ‘multiplicative’ (volume-specific) fluctuations ( , see also Appendix 1 for details and for the validation with simulations). Central to the model is the definition of the parameter γ (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1) that sets the relative weight between two kinds of noise: when γ=1, we obtain dV/dt=α+ναV, and the model describes multiplicative specific growth rate fluctuations ( ). These fluctuations are symmetric with respect to a reference specific growth rate α, hence they can be interpreted as emerging from noise in biosynthetic rates (e.g., surface synthesis, protein synthesis, etc.). When γ=0, the model describes an additive noise of constant amplitude, acting symmetrically on growth speed dV/dt , which can be interpreted as resulting from any of the homeostatic processes that contribute to setting steady-state volume (e.g., homeostatic constraints of biophysical origin on hydrostatic pressure, osmotic pressure, etc.). The model also allows for intermediate values of γ, which would effectively describe the combined presence of additive and multiplicative noise sources on growth.\n\nAn important prediction of the model ( ) is that the mean-normalized variance of growth rate (Fano factor) is not dependent on the timescale of the derivative. When we examined our experimental data, we observed that this was indeed the case ( ). The Fano factor of growth rate depends on γ, the mean specific growth rate α, and constant σ as follows:\n\nFano(dq)|V=σ2V2(γ−1)αq(V)\n\nwhere αq is the average log-return rate at fixed volume (see Appendix 1), and dq|V=[log⁡(V(t+dt))−log(V)]|V is a conditional ‘log return’ and quantifies the volume-specific growth rate in the presence of possible multiplicative fluctuations. Importantly, other estimators of variability such as variance, SD, or CV do depend on the timescale of the discrete derivatives in both the model and the data. We thus decided to use the Fano factor to estimate the variability in growth rate. We found that the Fano factor of volume growth rate (measured using the ‘log return’ dq) decreased rapidly with volume and that the trends measured in G1 and S-G2 overlapped well ( ). This suggests that the decay in volume growth rate variability is independent of cell cycle phase. We thus pooled the two phases together and compared the decay with our model predictions ( ). Comparison of the model predictions for the two extreme cases (γ=1 and γ=0) and the data shows that the data are very close to a scenario where γ≃0 and fluctuations are almost entirely additive ( ).\n\nTo estimate whether such additive noise came from extrinsic experimental noise, we conducted a series of experimental controls. We first observe that, to measure cell volume, we use areas much larger than the cell, thus naturally preventing from errors induced by poor segmentation. Importantly, previous validation of the FXm (Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015; Cadart et al., 2017) as well as new controls (shown in ) show that FXm accuracy is independent of the excess area around the cell used to calculate volume. A recent study also showed that volume measurement using FXm is not altered by cell shape changes (Venkova et al., 2021). As a second test, we compared the fluctuations of detrended cell volume curves to background areas ( ). This analysis shows that cell volume fluctuations are about 20-fold larger than those of the background ( ). Hence, technical sources of noise (which equally impact background and cell volume measurements) contribute minimally to measured volume fluctuations. Third, we measured volume fluctuations on cells imaged at high temporal resolution (every 30 ms) for time spans of 9 s. At this timescale, cells showed much smaller fluctuations compared with cells measured every 10 min (approximately sixfold less), thus strongly suggesting that the volume fluctuations we report are of biological origin and only appear at timescales larger than 9 s ( ). To identify the timescale of such fluctuations, we performed 20 s time-lapse experiments over 1 hr and subtracted a linear trend from the data to compensate for the average growth. The autocovariance function of these data shows that fluctuations decay over a timescale of ~10 min ( ), and this plot matches the analysis of the 10 min time-lapse experiments ( ). Overall, this analysis shows that volume fluctuations come principally from a constant-amplitude noise in instantaneously added volume, rather than from random variations of the volume-specific growth rate itself.\n\nSoftware analysis\n\nTo extract cell volume and cell cycle information from the images, we used a custom-made MATLAB software (Cadart et al., 2017). The software contained an image analysis algorithm previously optimized (Cadart et al., 2017) that performed successive image treatments to normalize the background intensity and correct for background inhomogeneity (e.g., due to an inhomogeneous light source). The algorithm then segmented the pillars and background to calibrate the fluorescence intensity signal using: (i) the average background intensity to calculate Imax , (ii) the average intensity under the pillars in the chamber to calculate Imin, and (iii) the known height of the chamber. The software then segmented and tracked single cells ( ) throughout the duration of the movie. If a cell divided, the event was recorded and the lineage tree for that cell recorded. Finally, the cell volume and hgeminin-GFP intensity were calculated over the segmented area for each cell and each movie frame.\n\nThe background normalization algorithm required the user to manually set several parameters. To ensure that these parameters were accurately chosen, a graphical user interface allowed the user to visualize the results of the image treatment given a set value for each parameter and assess its validity. This allowed, after a few trial and errors, setting a set of parameter values that were optimal for each set of movies obtained in the same FXm chamber. There were four steps to set these parameter values. First, to detect the pillars and later calculate Imin, the user manually set a threshold that segmented the pillars (from 0 to 1 on a normalized image), the user also set a ‘distance of influence’ around each pillar that consisted in an area larger than the pillar where cell volume would not be calculated to prevent potential artifacts of volume calculation due to a shadow caused by the pillars (see Cadart et al., 2017). Second, to estimate the background and later calculate Imax, the user chose a threshold to detect the cells (from 0 to 1 on a normalized image) and set the parameter called ‘noise factor.’ Third, using these parameter values, the image treatment algorithm was applied to the image. Fourth, on the resulting renormalized image, the user set the parameter values for cell segmentation and tracking: the average size of the mask and the threshold value to detect the cell, the maximum moving distance for a cell from one image to the next, the radius around each detected cell (to prevent measuring cells that were too close to each other), the minimum cell size and a parameter ‘sigma’ that represented a threshold allowing splitting of an object into two distinct object (e.g., after cell division or when two cells are near each other).\n\nDuring the optimization phase of the analysis pipeline, we reran the analysis on the same movies using different parameter values to test the robustness of the volume calculated to variabilities in user-defined parameter values. The volume curves obtained were very similar and indicated that errors in volume measurement due to variability in parameter settings were negligible. Once the algorithm parameters were set, the software processed hundreds of movies in batch mode using parallel processing to increase the speed of processing. The analysis of a set of movies coming from one experiment took 2–3 full days of computer processing. At the end of this step, we obtained hundreds of movies showing the tracking results ( ). Each movie was then visually checked to correct any errors of segmentation.\n\nOur editorial process produces two outputs: (i) public reviews designed to be posted alongside the preprint for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

You may include a further test modifying osmotic conditions, but it is not a requirement.\n\nReviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):\n\nIn \"Volume growth in animal cells is cell cycle dependent and shows additive fluctuations\", the authors use a volume exclusion-based measurements to quantify single cell trajectories of volume increase in HeLa cells. The study represents one of the most careful measurements on volume regulation in animal cells and presents evidence for feedback mechanisms that slow the growth of larger cells. This is an important demonstration of cell autonomous volume regulation.\n\nFrom these measurements, they describe two insights:\n\n1) A cell's growth rate is a joint function of both cell size and cell cycle stage.\n\n2) Our observation that volume growth shows additive fluctuations.\n\nWhile the subject matter of the present study is important, the insights provided are significantly limited because the authors failed to place their findings in the context of previous literature. The authors present what seems to be remarkably accurate single cell growth trajectories. In animal cells, a joint dependency of growth rate on cell size and cell cycle stage has been previously reported (see eLife 2018 PMID: 29889021 and Science 2009 PMID: 19589995). In Ginzberg et al., it is reported \"Our data revealed that, twice during the cell cycle, growth rates are selectively increased in small cells and reduced in large cells\". Nonetheless, these previous studies do not negate the novelty in Cadart et al. While both Cadart and Ginzberg investigate a dependency of cellular growth rate on cell size and cell cycle stage, the two studies are complimentary. This is because, while Ginzberg characterise the growth in cell mass, Cadart characterise the growth in cell volume. The authors should compare the findings from these previous studies with their own and draw conclusions from the similarities and differences. Are the cell cycle stage dependent growth rate similar or different when cell size is quantified as mass or volume? Does the faster growth of smaller cells (the negative correlation of growth rate and cell size) occur in different cell cycle stages when growth is quantified by volume as compared to mass?\n\nSeparate from the phenomenological findings, the authors provide little mechanistic insight. In recent years, mechanisms of cell size regulation have gained more molecular grounding. At least two studies have shown that the selective growth of small cells is mediated by a cell size checkpoint in G1 (Dev Cell 2021 PMID: 34022133). Further, the linkage of cell mass and cell volume has been linked to NKCC1 (PMID: 31067471) and mTORC1. While phenotypic findings are not inferior to molecular ones, the authors should not ignore previous mechanistic findings -if only to prevent the misleading notion that their phenotypic observations stand in mechanistic vacuum and molecular mechanisms on growth regulation are non-existent.\n\nAs for the authors findings on the additive fluctuations in volume growth rate, the authors do not address the following trivial possibility. When considering cell mass, one could easily imagine why larger cells would grow faster. Larger cell mass can correlate with more ribosomes, for example, which can result in faster rates of protein synthesis. Similarly, cells that are larger in mass can have more ion channels or aquaporins, which can affect how fast cells increase their volume. By contrast, if cells increase their water content and become larger in volume only (as is the case in hypoosmotic conditions), I would not expect a proportional increase in growth rate. I suspect that, while the authors measure volume and not mass, the exponential kinetics that they observe still derive from the dependency of growth rate on cell mass (and not cell volume). It is only because mass and volume correlate that the authors observe exponential kinetics in volume. While my suspicion can prove false, it cannot be assumed false until empirically shown to be so. One path to test this is to dissociate volume and mass (e.g. changes in osmolarity).\n\nThe authors report a distinction in the growth of newborn cells, as compared to cells at the later stages of cell cycle. These results are potentially interesting but are at jeopardy of being an artifact of the morphological changes that characterise newborn cells. Shortly after cell division, cells are less flat and occupy a higher volume from the glass surface on which they are cultured. These morphological changes distance the cells from the objective focal plane and can distort the measurement light intensity. The authors should find a way to control for this possible artifact or exclude this data.\n\nEssential revisions:\n\n1) Please provide evidence that potential sources of experimental noise coming from segmentation, autofluorescence, movement are not the root cause of the observed noise. For example with the experiments suggested by Referee 1 point 1.\n\nThese important comments from reviewer 1 prompted us to perform a careful evaluation of the following potential sources of noise:\n\nArea of volume segmentation and noise on an object of fixed volume\n\nThe new Figure 5 – Supplement 2a-c, discussed in the main text, shows that volume calculation using FXm is independent of the area around the cell used to integrate the fluorescence: when we draw areas of increasing dimensions around the cell (see the example in Figure 5 – Supplement 2a) and measure the cell volume, the measured volume for a given cell remains remarkably constant (Figure 5 – Supplement 2b). For the range of areas experimentally used to calculate cell volume, the fluctuations of measured volume for a given cell are not correlated with the size of the area and remain stable around +/-0.2% (Figure 5 – Supplement 2c).\n\nThe new Figure 5 – Supplement 2d-f (discussed in the main text), compares fluctuations of detrended cell volume curves and background areas of equivalent size. We show that cell volume fluctuations are about 20-fold larger than the background, supporting the idea that technical sources of noise such as fluctuations of the lamp intensity contribute minimally to measured cell volume fluctuations (Figure 5 – Supplement 2f).\n\nFinally, we agree with reviewer 1 that it would be instrumental to measure a static object such as beads. We tried measuring beads or PDMS debris but these objects scatter light in a way that compromises the correct measurement of the fluorescence. Instead, we decided to measure cells at very high temporal resolution (30 msec) for a short period of time (9 sec), where one can safely assume that the cell does not grow and is similar to a static object. At this time scale, cells showed very small fluctuations compared to cells measured every 10 minutes in our dataset (~6 folds less), confirming that the larger part of the fluctuations we report are not caused by the FXm but are likely of biological origin (Figure 5 – Supplement 2f).\n\nSegmentation errors\n\nReviewer 1 and 2 asked whether noise could arise from segmentation errors. Such errors are unlikely in our data for multiple reasons. Firstly, in order to calculate cell volume, we typically integrate fluorescence over areas larger than the cells, and we showed above that the error from the excess area is negligible. Secondly, we inspected visually each curve after the automated segmentation algorithm for events where cells encounter each other or remain attached to each other after birth, and excluded the timepoints where cells are badly segmented (see ).\n\nShape changes\n\nTo answer this question, we kindly refer the reviewer to another series of experiments we have performed in Venkova et al., biorXiv 2021. Specifically, the correlation between cell area and volume at steady state is weak ( B, left panel) suggesting that the method of measurement is not dependent on cell spreading area. However, for cells in suspension that start spreading, the speed of spreading impacts cell volume and cells that spread slowly seldom change their volume while cells that spread fast do ( B, right panels). These experiments thus support the idea that the speed of spreading, not the change in cell shape due to spreading causes a change in volume. They also rule out the possibility that simply changing shape might impact the measure of the cell volume, since cells that spread slowly display a constant volume, while they drastically change their shape.\n\nAutofluorescence\n\nTo address reviewer 1’s question regarding the potential contribution of cell autofluorescence we performed additional experiments measuring cells vs. background areas without cells in FXm chambers that did not contain any fluorescent dextran, using the same illumination parameters as for a typical FXm experiment. The intensity measured for cells is comparable to background areas and very small (~100 A.U.) compared with values typically measured in presence of Dextran to calculate cell volume (~ 6000 A.U.) (see ).\n\n2) Please try to obtain the timescale of fluctuation correlations by increasing the temporal resolution.\n\nIn the main text and in the new Figure 5 – Supplement 3, we report the results of newly performed 20 sec timelapse experiments over one hour to investigate the timescale of volume fluctuations. The autocvariance function analysis on the detrended curves shows that fluctuations decay over a few minutes (Figure 5 – Supplement 3a-c), a timescale that matches the analysis of the 10 min timelapse experiments\n\n3) Please further explain the rationale for removing outliers or include them in the statistics.\n\nThe IQR-criteria is designed to remove only rare and obvious outliers (i.e. a jump in volume of more than 15% in 1 frame -10 minutes- which arguably cannot happen biologically). Fluctuations of smaller range are kept ( ). We looked back at the raw data and calculated that the IQR filtering removes a total of 337 measurement points out of 99935 initial points (0.03% of the points).\n\n4) Please discuss the connection of your results with previous literature (eLife 2018 PMID: 29889021 and Science 2009 PMID: 19589995) and to previously proposed molecular mechanisms\n\nWe included the following new paragraph in the Discussion discussing these references.\n\n“We find that volume-specific growth rate is 15% higher in S-G2 than G1. Mathematical frameworks and experiments clearly showed that growth rate modulation as a function of cell size1–3 contributes to cell-size homeostasis. Other identified volume modulations along the cell cycle4,5 including the reported mass oscillations6,7 do not appear to be cell-size dependent and are thus unlikely to contribute to cell size control. The mechanisms driving such growth variations and their role in cell physiology remain mysterious. The molecular pathways underlying size homeostasis8–10 may provide some explanations, but the identification and investigation of novel biosynthetic regulatory mechanisms may also be important. For example, the 15% increase in volume-specific growth rate in S-G2 may be the result of a similar increase in protein biosynthesis, but this would not meet the common expectations, given that both transcript levels11,12 and ribosome amounts13 scale linearly with cell volume – at least within the physiological range of cell volume14. Future experiments may determine whether other factors such as DNA copy number, translation rate15 or import of nutrients and small molecules16 play a role in the observed volume growth-rate change in S-G2.”\n\n5) Please discuss the possibility that exponential growth in volume is due to exponential growth in mass. You may include a further test modifying osmotic conditions, but it is not a requirement.\n\nWe believe that the experiments suggested here are beyond the scope of our current work – where mass is not measured. We note that the hypothesis that volume follows mass explains exponential growth for volume, but not additive fluctuations. We included the following paragraph discussing the coupling between volume and mass growth:\n\n“It is commonly assumed that volume follows mass, due e.g. to osmotic pressure changes17. Under this assumption, an average exponential growth in volume is explained by an exponential growth in mass. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms coupling mass and volume growth in animal cells is still incomplete. There is consensus on a role of mTORC118, mTORC219,20 and of the Hippo pathway 21, and another study showed that the YAP/TAZ/Hippo pathway may regulate cell volume independently of mTORC and protein synthesis21, highlighting that a decoupling can occur at the regulatory level. Of note, time-variability in ribosome levels and autocatalysis would lead to a fluctuating mass-specific biosynthesis rate, hence to multiplicative fluctuations (not additive) in mass growth rate. Thus, under the hypothesis that volume strictly follows mass, volume would also likely exhibit multiplicative fluctuations.”\n\nReviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):\n\nIn \"Volume growth in animal cells is cell cycle dependent and shows additive fluctuations\", the authors use a volume exclusion-based measurements to quantify single cell trajectories of volume increase in HeLa cells.

Are the cell cycle stage dependent growth rate similar or different when cell size is quantified as mass or volume? Does the faster growth of smaller cells (the negative correlation of growth rate and cell size) occur in different cell cycle stages when growth is quantified by volume as compared to mass?\n\nWe have clarified these points in our revised manuscript. In a previous publication (Cadart et al., 2018), we reported a negative correlation between growth speed in G1 and cell volume at birth and hypothesized that it contributed to size control. In this current work, we do not address cell size control because we did not focus on obtaining complete volume curves, from birth to division but instead performed shorter experiments (24 hours) and acquired many short (~10 hours) volume curves. We believe that the higher volume-specific growth rate we observe in S/G2 compared to G1 is likely not related to cell size control, as it is not cell-size dependent. A further caveat (additional to the fact that Ginzberg and coworkers measure mass and our study focuses on volume) is that this study focuses on volume-specific growth rate, while Ginzberg and coworkers, in their statement quoted above, refer to what we call growth speed.\n\nSeparate from the phenomenological findings, the authors provide little mechanistic insight. In recent years, mechanisms of cell size regulation have gained more molecular grounding. At least two studies have shown that the selective growth of small cells is mediated by a cell size checkpoint in G1 (Dev Cell 2021 PMID: 34022133).

The authors should find a way to control for this possible artifact or exclude this data.\n\nThis issue is addressed in point 5 of the essential revisions above. We added a discussion of the coupling between mass and volume. We note that while mass-volume coupling could explain a mean exponential growth of volume, in this hypothesis, time-variability in ribosome levels and autocatalysis would lead to a fluctuating mass-specific biosynthesis rate, hence to multiplicative fluctuations (not additive) in mass growth rate. Thus, under the hypothesis that volume strictly follows mass, volume would also likely exhibit multiplicative fluctuations.\n\nWe also refer to a related work from some of us (Venkova et al., BiorXiv 2021) which shows that cell volume measurement using FXm is independent of cell shape changes (see also essential revisions)."
