        "text": "List of Suggested Term Papers: Please click here to see a list of suggested Term Papers.\n\nThe Term paper will be due at 9:00 am on Wednesday December 16, 2015 , which is not the official day of the Final Exam for Physics 561 (12/11/2015), in room 3110 ESB.\n\nThe Final Exam will consist on an oral presentation of your paper for the entire class. Each one of you will have 20 minutes to present your work. The presentations will take place on Wednesday December 16, beginning at 9:00 am, in Rm. 3110 ESB. Please check the Final Exam Program to see at what time you are scheduled to give your talk. Please note that all students will be expected to attend all the talks.\n\nYou will assume that you are giving a talk for a reasonably educated audience of people that took this class. The talks must be reasonably self-contained, and the assumptions and your results must be clearly stated. You will also turn in your written paper on the day of the presentation. At the end of the Semester I will put all the Term Papers together in a printed volume which will be distributed among the students registered in the class. The talks will be computer presentations. You may prepare your slides using LaTeX, PowerPoint or Keynote. I will have my MacBook at hand and all the presentations will be stored on my computer so we can save time. I will need to have your presentation sent to me before 12:00 noon that day by email so I can set it up on my computer. I will have a projector installed in the room.\n\nThe paper must be formatted in LaTeX, which is the standard program for the production of science papers. Other lower quality formats, such as Word, will not be accepted.\n\nThe paper must be at least ten (10) pages long, double spaced pages, not including the title page, in 10pt. font. The title page must include the title, your name and an abstract. The paper must include a section with introductory material in which you give the background information and the main motivation. There should also be a main section in which you discuss the principal content, including the details of the model, the approximations that you use and the techniques that are needed to understand the results. Here you will present the main results and you will discuss whatever calculations you had to do. You may put the details of these calculations in an Appendix if these calculations are too involved and disrupt the natural logical flow of the paper. You should have section with your Conclusions and another one with your References."
