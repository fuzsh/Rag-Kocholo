        "text": "The ashes of Marie Curie were enshrined in the Pantheon in Paris today, making the celebrated scientist the first woman honored at the memorial dedicated to the \"great men\" of France.\n\nThe ceremony was a symbolic triumph for French campaigners for women's rights and was decreed by President Francois Mitterrand, who had ordered that the ashes of Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, be transferred from a small-town cemetery to the majestic domed monument that also holds the remains of Frenchmen like Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo and Emile Zola.\n\nThe couple shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1903, and she won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1911. With their discoveries of polonium and radium, \"they changed the face of the world,\" the 1993 Nobel Physics laureate, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, said at the ceremony. Today, the name \"curie\" is used today for the unit of measurement of radioactivity.\n\nMarie Curie was a native of Poland, where she was born Marie Sklodowska in Warsaw in 1867, and President Lech Walesa of Poland joined Mr. Mitterrand at the ceremony today. During her heyday, Marie Curie was denied membership in the Academy of Sciences, which was all-male."
