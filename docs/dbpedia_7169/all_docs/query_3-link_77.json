        "text": "The European Physical Journal E - Soft Matter and Biological Physics (EPJE) has awarded Iranian physicist Ramin Golestanian the 2017 EPJE Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Lecture Prize. Golestanian was selected for his outstanding theoretical contributions to the physics of microswimmers and their hydrodynamic interactions which have led to a series of exciting new discoveries and stimulated the development of the field of active matter.\n\nThis is the sixth time this prestigious prize, named after the Nobel laureate who founded EPJE, has been awarded. The EPJE Pierre-Gilles de Gennes lecture will be delivered by Golestanian during the 10th Liquid Matter Conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia, which takes place from 17-21 July 2017.\n\nRamin Golestanian completed his PhD at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) in Zanjan, Iran, under the remote supervision of Mehran Kardar from MIT. He followed with an independent postdoctoral research fellowship at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Before joining the University of Oxford in 2010 as professor of theoretical condensed matter physics, he held academic positions at IASBS and the University of Sheffield. His broad research interests include nonequilibrium statistical physics, soft matter, and biological physics. Golestanian is renowned for his work on active matter and, in particular, for his role in developing microscopic swimmers and active colloids. He is recipient of the Holweck Medal of the Société Française de Physique and the Institute of Physics, and is the author of over 130 articles in peer reviewed journals. He recently edited a special issue on active matter in EPJE together with physicist Sriram Ramaswamy.\n\nThe EPJE Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Lecture Prize is sponsored by the European Physical Journal (EPJ) co-publishers, which consist of the Italian Physical Society (SIF) and the publishers EDP Sciences and Springer. It is awarded to outstanding scientists for their contribution to soft matter research.\n\nThe European Physical Journal E publishes papers describing advances in the understanding of physical aspects of soft matter and biological systems. This includes reports of experimental, computational and theoretical studies and appeals to the broad interdisciplinary communities including physics, chemistry, biology and materials science.\n\nThe European Physical Journals are international peer-reviewed publications covering the whole spectrium of pure and applied physics, including related interdisciplinary subjects. They are a continuation of Acta Physica Hungarica, Anales de Fisica, Czechoslovak Journal of Physics, Fizika A, Il Nuovo Cimento, Journal de Physique, Portugaliae Physica and Zeitschrift für Physik.\n\nThe EPJE Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Lecture will be given on Thursday 20 July at 9:00am (CET) during the 10th Liquid Matter Conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\n\n###\n\nSpringer is a leading global scientific, technical and medical portfolio, providing researchers in academia, scientific institutions and corporate R&D departments with quality content through innovative information, products and services. Springer has one of the strongest STM and HSS eBook collections and archives, as well as a comprehensive range of hybrid and open access journals. Springer is part of Springer Nature, a global publisher that serves and supports the research community. Springer Nature aims to advance discovery by publishing robust and insightful science, supporting the development of new areas of research and making ideas and knowledge accessible around the world."
