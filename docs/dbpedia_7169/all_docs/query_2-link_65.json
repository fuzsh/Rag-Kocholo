        "text": "Guidelines for nominators\n\nNominations open 18 October.\n\nNominations close 18 January, 17:00 GMT\n\nOnly RSC members can nominate for this prize\n\nNominees may NOT nominate themselves\n\nWe will not consider nominations of deceased individuals.\n\nNominees can only be considered for one of our Research & Innovation Prizes in any given year. In a case where a nominee is nominated for more than one prize independently, RSC staff will ask the nominee which prize they would like to be considered for.\n\nIndividuals named in any of the following roles during the nomination and judging period are not eligible to nominate or be nominated:\n\nMaterials Chemistry Prize Committee members\n\nRSC Subject Community Presidents\n\nRSC Prize Committee members\n\nTrustees of the Royal Society of Chemistry\n\nRoyal Society of Chemistry staff\n\nThe prize is open to nominees based in the UK or internationally\n\nThere are no career stage restrictions associated with this prize\n\nWhen nominating previous RSC prize or award winners, please remember that a person cannot be awarded twice for substantially the same body of work\n\nNominees should only be nominated once for this prize in any given prize cycle. In cases where we receive more than one nomination for the same nominee, only one nomination will go forward to judging.\n\nStarting from the 2023 cycle, unsuccessful nominations for this prize will automatically rollover to the next prize cycle, unless the nominee’s circumstances have changed so as to make them ineligible, in relation to the eligibility criteria for the prize as outlined above. We encourage nominators to update their nomination between cycles when the nomination window is open. Nominations will be considered for two consecutive prize cycles.\n\nTo make a nomination, please use our online nominations system to submit the following information:\n\nYour name, contact details, and membership number (please contact the RSC Membership team if you do not know your membership details). The RSC reserves the right to amend nominations if necessary to ensure the anonymity of the nominator.\n\nYour nominee's name and contact details.\n\nAn up to date CV for the nominee (no longer than one A4 side, 11pt text) which should include a summary of their education and career, and a maximum of 5 relevant publications or patents\n\nA short citation describing what the nominee should be awarded for. This must be no longer than 250 characters (including spaces) and no longer than one sentence\n\nA supporting statement (up to 750 words) addressing the selection criteria\n\nA statement (up to 100 words) describing how your nominee has contributed more broadly to the scientific community. A list of possible examples is outlined in the ‘selection criteria’ tab.\n\nReferences are not required for this prize and will not be accepted\n\nThe RSC reserves the right to rescind any prize if there are reasonable grounds to do so. All nominators will be asked to confirm that to the best of their knowledge there is no impediment, relating to professional conduct, to their nominee receiving this prize. All prize winners will be asked to sign the RSC’s Code of Conduct Declaration for Recognition.\n\nMake a nomination\n\nSelection Criteria and Judging Panel\n\nOur selection committees base their evaluations on the overall quality of relevant contributions and achievements by nominees, in relation to the selection criteria listed below.\n\nThe scientific content of any supporting publications, as described in the supporting statement, is much more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it is published.\n\nThe selection committee will consider the following aspects of nominations for this prize:\n\nOriginality of research\n\nImpact of research\n\nQuality of publications and/or patents and/or software\n\nInnovation\n\nProfessional standing\n\nCollaborations and teamwork\n\nOther indicators of esteem indicated by the nominator\n\nIn an instance where multiple nominees are judged equally meritorious in relation to the above criteria, judging panels have the flexibility to use information provided by the nominator on the nominee’s broader contribution to the chemistry community as an additional criterion.\n\nExamples of relevant contributions could include, but are not limited to:\n\nInvolvement with Royal Society of Chemistry member groups/networks\n\nTeaching/demonstrating\n\nEffective mentorship\n\nService on boards, committees or panels\n\nLeadership in the scientific community\n\nPeer-reviewer\n\nPromotion of diversity and inclusion\n\nAdvocacy for chemistry\n\nPublic engagement and outreach\n\nMaterials Chemistry Prize Committee\n\nMagda Titirici, Imperial College London (Chair)\n\nRachel Evans, University of Cambridge\n\nMarina Freitag, Newcastle University\n\nAndrew Goodwin, University of Oxford\n\nManuel Salmeron-Sanchez, University of Glasgow\n\nDavid Scanlon, University College London\n\nHistory of the prize\n\nEstablished in 2008, the de Gennes Prize, formerly the Prize for Materials Chemistry, honours the work of Nobel laureate Pierre-Gilles de Gennes.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1932 de Gennes went on to become a research engineer at the Atomic Energy Centre, Saclay, where he received his PhD in magnetism in 1957. After completing his postdoctoral training in California he returned to France as an assistant professor at the University of Paris in Orsay. During this time he completed highly influential work in the area of surface superconductivity and wrote the classic book Superconductivity of metals and alloys.\n\nHis later research interests included liquid crystals, polymer physics, and the physical chemistry of adhesion. He even went on to his investigate the dynamics of wetting to help improve the growing of grapes for wine, demonstrating his keen sense of humour as applied to his work.\n\nIn 1991 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for \"discovering that methods for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalised to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers\". His peers considered him to be one of 'the giants in physics and a beacon to the field of liquid crystals'.\n\nAfter receiving this accolade, de Gennes shared his enthusiasm for his subject and visited an impressive 200 schools between 1992 and 1994.\n\nFrom 2020, as part of a series of changes following an independent review of the Royal Society of Chemistry's recognition programmes, this prize (odd years) will alternate with the John B Goodenough Award (even years)."
