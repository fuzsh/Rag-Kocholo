His work with complex fluids showed that methods already used to study the physics of simple systems could be adapted to study the behavior of molecules and molecular chains in soft matter.\n\nFather: Robert Joachim Pierre de Gennes (physician)\n\nMother: Marthe Marie Yvonne Morin-Pons (nurse)\n\nWife: Anne Marie Elisabeth Eugènie Rouet (m. 1954, until his death, three children)\n\nUniversity: PhD, École Normale Supérieure, Paris, France (1955)\n\nScholar: Physics, University of California at Berkeley (1958-59)\n\nProfessor: Solid-State Physics, Paris-South University (1961-71)\n\nProfessor: Physics, Collège de France (1971-2002)\n\nAdministrator: College of Physics and Chemistry, Paris (1976-2002)\n\nFrench Atomic Energy Commission Research (1955-59)\n\nIOP Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize 1968\n\nAMPERE Prize 1977\n\nMatteucci Medal 1987\n\nHarvey Prize 1988\n\nLorentz Medal 1990\n\nWolf Prize in Physics 1990 (with David J.
