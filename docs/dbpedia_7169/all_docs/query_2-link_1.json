        "text": "Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (born October 24, 1932, Paris, France—died May 18, 2007, Orsay) was a French physicist, who was awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize for Physics for his discoveries about the ordering of molecules in liquid crystals and polymers.\n\nThe son of a physician, Gennes studied at the École Normale Supérieure. He was employed as an engineer at the French Atomic Energy Commission (1955–61) and then was a professor with the Orsay Liquid Crystals Group of the University of Paris (1961–71). He later taught at the Collège de France (1971–76) and served as director of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles (1976–2002).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science\n\nGennes investigated how extremely complex forms of matter behave during the transition from order to disorder. He showed how electrically or mechanically induced phase changes transform liquid crystals from a transparent to an opaque state, the phenomenon exploited in liquid-crystal displays. His research on polymers contributed to understanding how the long molecular chains in molten polymers move, making it possible for scientists to better determine and control polymer properties."
