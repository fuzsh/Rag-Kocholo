        "text": "David Schwartz\n\nBoard Chair / Education Director\n\n[email protected]\n\n​\n\nDavid Schwartz is the former Department Chair of Geology, Oceanography and Environmental Science at Cabrillo College in Aptos, California. After 35 years, David retired from Cabrillo College in June 2021.\n\nDavid obtained a B.S. Degree in Geology and Mineralogy from The Ohio State University in the spring of 1979. For the following 10 months, he worked as a Water Quality Technician for the Environmental Protection Agency in Columbus Ohio. David earned an M.S. degree in Marine Geology in 1983 from San Jose State University and Moss Landing Marine Labs. His emphasis was estuarine evolution and coastal systems and his research focused on the geologic history of the wetland Elkhorn Slough in central Monterey Bay.\n\nAfter graduate school, David taught at Hartnell College in Salinas and San Jose State University for the next 3 years. Professor Schwartz found a home at Cabrillo College in 1986 and successfully taught generations of Santa Cruz area residents about earth, marine, and environmental science and about putting in the hard work success requires.\n\nDavid’s mother was born and raised in Asbury Park NJ and his love of the oceans began in the 1960s and matured for over 50 years during dozens of summers playing with family in the Atlantic Ocean.In the 1970’s David attended an SOS protest raising awareness about illegal hospital waste dumping, and contaminated needles washing ashore from Atlantic City to NY, opening his eyes to the political aspect of environmentalism.\n\nHis ongoing passion is to clean up the shoreline environment and raise awareness of global marine plastic debris. He has hosted over 45 coastal cleanups in the span of 24 years and is proud to be an active member of Clean Oceans International since 2011.\n\nPatricia Lieberg-Clark\n\nBoard Treasurer / Environmental Plastic Assessment Program Coordinator\n\n[email protected]\n\n​\n\n​Patti grew up in Huntington Beach, California, and fell in love with the ocean at an early age. She attended Orange Coast College, where she assisted with shipboard marine mammal photo-ID research off the coast of southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Patti transferred to UC Santa Cruz and earned a Bachelor’s degree with a senior thesis on marine mammal pollution ecology. In addition, she was the Research Coordinator for the NMFS (NOAA) Marine Mammal Stranding Network at UCSC's Long Marine Lab for six years after completing her degree.\n\nPatti crewed in two blue water sailing voyages; one from Santa Barbara to Mexico's Gulf of California, and one from west to east through the Panama Canal and exploration of the San Blas Islands. She was shocked to observe incredible amounts of plastic debris in the remote regions she visited.\n\nPatti became involved with COI in 2010 while working for Cabrillo College Oceanography, Geology, and Environmental Science Department, where she helped start an educational collaboration and internship program. She has worked for COI as Expedition Coordinator and has been serving on the Board of Directors since January 2018.\n\nIn 2021, Patti earned a MAS degree in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, where she studied coastal blue carbon ecosystems and worked as a research assistant for the Scripps-Rady Plastic Pollution Challenge. She has returned to Santa Cruz, where she enjoys hiking, kayaking, sailing, wildlife biology, geology, and coffee.\n\nEliot Headley\n\nBoard Secretary\n\n[email protected]\n\nEliot began his relationship with COI as a young student at Cabrillo College, studying the variety of disciplines that make up an Ecology education. In Geology class he discovered, as many had before him, that Professor David Schwartz was a bit more of a teacher of life, than merely about physical science. Eliot took the bait, he got more than involved, he immersed himself.\n\nEliot was one of the first students involved when COI and Cabrillo began a pilot project in 2011. He stepped up and became actively involved and grew with the program. He was a natural choice to be an assistant and soon evolved to teaching the Field Research component of COI’s Environmental Plastic Assessment Program (EPAP).\n\nEliot became an educated advocate for ocean awareness and a standout instructor. He developed a relationship with the singing group “Rising Appalachia” and presented on stage at their shows. He created and led a beach cleanup and plastic education event at a music festival in Oregon with RA and started a plastics awareness relationship with Sierra Nevada College in Lake Tahoe. Eliot then served as field survey instructor on a Clean Oceans International expedition to Cuba in 2017 for accomplished educators and marine professionals.\n\nSince completing school programs Eliot has traveled in Central and South America, expanding his scientific and cultural horizons. He has recently become active with COI again."
