        "text": "It is a great honor and pleasure to introduce the 2020 Bingham Medal recipient, Professor Ole Hassager. I was fortunate to study under Ole’s mentorship for three years and am forever grateful for his friendship and guidance. What follows is a short biography of Ole’s life and scientific achievements.\n\nEarly Years\n\nOle was born on the small island of Bornholm (588 km2) in the Baltic Sea. While this may not seem especially notable given that Denmark (42,933 km2 excluding Greenland) is composed of 443 named islands and one peninsula, Bornholm is quite special in its location and isolation. For one, it is closer to Sweden than it is to Denmark. The island is located off the southeast coast of Sweden, and is approximately 250 km by boat from Copenhagen, Denmark’s largest city. The island sits advantageously in the center of the Baltic Sea and is a strategic stronghold between Germany and Sweden.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin\n\nScientific Achievements\n\nNonlinear extensional dynamics of entangled linear polymers. In 2003, Hassager and coworkers made the first measurements of steady extensional viscosity of a nearly monodisperse polymer melt. The purpose was to test the theoretical predictions of the Doi-Edwards (DE) constitutive equation for polymer melts. Until then, extensional experiments testing the DE model had been performed on room-temperature entangled polymer solutions. While dilute polymer solutions showed a general agreement with the predictions of the DE model accounting for chain stretch, to the surprise of the rheological community polymer melt extensional measurements showed no such increase. This disagreement plagued the rheological community for nearly a decade. The first real breakthrough came when Hassager and co-workers managed to bridge solution and melt behavior using viscous oligomers as solvent. Only recently is a clear picture emerging that involves the nematic interaction between polymer chains in the melt state not possible in solution, and the increase of the distance between entanglements (and thus the segment extensibility) upon dilution. The Hassager group data is still the quintessential test for nonlinear constitutive models of polymer melts and blends.\n\nNonlinear dynamics of industrial polymers. Long chain branched polyethylenes exhibit a remarkable overshoot in the tensile stress difference upon inception of constant rate extensional flow. These results have intrigued theorists and have been met with skepticism of experimental method. Hassager has played a leading role in the demonstration of the phenomenon and in putting it into a broader context in terms of comparison with cross-slot measurements, creep measurements, constitutive analysis and flow induced crystallization.\n\nNonlinear extensional dynamics of model polymers of complex architecture. Hassager and co-workers have made significant contributions in the synthesis and rheological characterization of polymers of well-defined architecture as model systems to emulate industrial branched polymers. The stress overshoot was attributed to the presence of a “cross-bar” via the synthesis and rheology of a polystyrene ‘Pom-Pom’ molecule (or “H-polymer”) with well-defined cross-bar. More recently Hassager and coworkers have confirmed the theoretical prediction by Ianniruberto and Marrucci that entangled melts of branched polystyrenes behave like linear polystyrenes in the steady state of fast extensional flow. Finally, in collaboration with last year’s Bingham medalist (Dimitris Vlassopoulos) Hassager and coworkers discovered the unexpected dramatic strain hardening of entangled ring macromolecules.\n\nFinite element modeling of viscoelastic flow. Hassager has pioneered the application of the Lagrangian specification in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. This has led to finite element methods that handle 3D transient deformation and flow of non-linear viscoelastic materials with free surfaces with relative ease. For example, these efforts have been able to analyze and explain sample break-up in dual cylinder wind-up extensional measurements, such as the extensional viscosity fixture (EVF) and the SER device.\n\nFracture in viscoelastic liquids. Hassager and co-workers were the first to combine extensional rheometry with high speed imaging in the investigation of fracture. The pioneering work is best summarized by a Viewpoint article by physics fracture expert Jay Fineberg who wrote: “Hassager and co-workers’ study demonstrated that the classic fracture picture crosses over to a characteristic behavior first predicted by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, in which the viscous response of the material dominates the elastic response … The idea of soft materials has challenged our classic notions of fluid and solid materials. Experiments such as these manifestly demonstrate that processes such as brittle fracture … can indeed take place in fluid-like materials …”\n\nDevelopment of instrumentation for rheology. Hassager and co-workers pioneered the development of actively-controlled filament stretching rheometrylogy with temperature control. For nearly a decade, Hassager’s laboratory was the only place capable of performing filament stretching measurements on polymer melts. In 2015, a controlled filament stretching rheometer, the VADER1000, became commercially available from Rheo Filament ApS, a start-up company co-founded by Hassager. The EVF/SER fixtures and the VADER1000 rheometer are the only commercial instruments presently available for extensional melt rheology. Unique features of the VADER1000 are the ability to study tensile stress relaxation, tensile creep, and reversed flow in both polymer melts and solutions.\n\nOne recipe for Ole’s success is his willingness and openness for collaboration. One such example is his third consecutive participation in a polymer-focused EU funded project. Many of these collaborations originate from discussions at meetings and invitations to spend time in Copenhagen as Ole’s guest speaker. During my time at DTU, I was fortunate to enjoy several visits from researchers all over the world. It was a fantastic way of developing new ideas, talking about impactful problems, and developing a broader understanding of rheology and its role in industry and science. It is no wonder that Ole has always chosen thoughtful, impactful problems to solve. He certainly serves as a beacon for rheology in Northern Europe and continues to be an inspiration for young rheologists (me included). While his Danish modesty does not allow him to acknowledge his own significant achievements in science, join me in celebrating them for him. This year’s Bingham medal goes to a most deserving rheologist, but more importantly to an amazing educator, advisor, and steward of science.\n\nSources\n\nAnn Vibeke Knudsen (ed), “Bornholm at War 1940-1946”, Bornholm Museum (2000).\n\nBørge Kure, “An island at war, Bornholm’s occupation history - based in the daily newspaper Bornholmeren”, Rønne (1981)."
