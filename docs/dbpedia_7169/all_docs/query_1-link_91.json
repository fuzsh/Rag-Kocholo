        "text": "Inspiring the Scientists of Tomorrow\n\nPerhaps the most crucial aspect of “Fête de la Science” and events like it is the opportunity to kindle the flame of scientific curiosity in young minds. Raul’s presentation to middle schoolers showcased the incredible potential of scientific research. By breaking down complex concepts into engaging and accessible explanations, he bridged the gap between high-end research and the budding scientists of the future.\n\nRaul’s work on microfluidic devices and their role in glia formation on neurons was a prime example of how science can be made relatable and exciting for young students. The experience left a lasting impression on these students, igniting their interest in the vast world of science and inspiring them to consider scientific careers.\n\nThe biotherapy field, in particular, holds immense promise for the future. As advancements continue to be made, the potential for groundbreaking treatments and cures becomes increasingly likely. By exposing young minds to this exciting field, we can cultivate the next generation of scientists and researchers who will lead the charge in developing new therapies and improving human health.\n\nSupporting High-End Research\n\nRaul’s lab, like many others, has benefited from the support of grants and funding. In this case, the Région Ile-de-France, through the DIM BioConvS, provided valuable equipment grants that allowed the lab to conduct innovative research. Moreover his doctoral fellowship is sponsored also by the previous wave of DIM projects! These grants play a pivotal role in ensuring that cutting-edge science continues to thrive and progress.\n\nA chat with Raúl Flores\n\nCan you present yourself and tell us why you wanted to participate in this scientific outreach event?\n\nMy name is Raúl Flores, I was born and raised in Mexico, where I had the opportunity to complete my Bachelor’s in Biotechnology Engineering. After two years of working as a Project Engineer in an agrochemical company (and highly influenced by the pandemic), I decided to take another professional path. Finally, in 2021, I came to France to start pursuing a scientific career, which I started with the master’s program in Microfluidics organized by the Institut Pierre Gilles de Gennes. Once I had completed it I started working as Ingénieur d’etudes in a project co-hosted by T3S (UMR-S 1124, INSERM) and MSC (UMR 7057, CNRS) and funded by DIM-ELICIT. This project is based on the study of the electrophysiological signal of neuron and myelin cultures by using microfluidic platforms.\n\nConcerning my motivation to participate, I think it was mainly influenced by two factors: the challenge that we as foreigners have to keep speaking in French, and secondly a way to improve my communication skills; concretely the fact that is not always that easy or intuitive to communicate a complex idea to people out of the same field.\n\nThis was your first time presenting your science to non-specialists, and moreover young students! How did it go?\n\nSince the public was mainly students from 10 to 15 years old, I was challenged to look for a lot of analogies and ways to simplify a bunch of terms. Nevertheless, this was not a limitation to showing them the potential of a microfluidic device, and moreover the importance of neuroscience. It was interesting to see how they were really amazed by looking at the microfluidic devices; using the microscope and even asking questions about how to use it, step by step. Sometimes it was a little bit harder to keep them interested, but once again; having something tangible (videos and material) was a gigantic support for them to better translate the talk and visualize it.\n\nHow was the overall experience and would you recommend it to other researchers like you?\n\nIn general, it was a really rewarding experience. Looking at the interest of the students in a project you’re collaborating on or working on it’s really reassuring. Moreover; the fact of being surrounded by other young researchers who are also investing some time to share their ideas, projects, and results with the general public, encourages you a lot. I highly recommend having this kind of experience since for me it was a really humane way to show the efforts behind our lab work."
