        "text": "The French physicist Pierre-Gilles de Gennes was best known for his theoretical work on liquid crystals.\n\nHe discovered that the methods developed to study order phenomena in simple systems can be generalised broadly to more complex forms of matter, particularly to polymers and liquid crystals â€“ a substance that is not quite a liquid and not quite a solid because it flows like a liquid but has some order in the arrangement of its molecules.\n\nDe Gennes worked out mathematically how, for example, long molecules or chains of molecules can sometimes form ordered states, and what happens when they change from an ordered to a disordered state. Such changes of order occur when, for example, a magnet is heated and changes from a state in"
