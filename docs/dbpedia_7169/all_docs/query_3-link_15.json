        "text": "Pierre Gilles de Gennes was one of the first student of the School during summer 1953.\n\n\"In the evening, in front of the fireplace, we found Schockley, one of the inventors of the transistor, who came to tell stories ... They made us all laugh ... The young students we were then faced suddenly, to the great founders of contemporary science (...) without any organization as it is now usually the case.\""
