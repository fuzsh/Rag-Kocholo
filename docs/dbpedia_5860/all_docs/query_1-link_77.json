        "text": "Leading up to the mile and aquarter Kentucky Derby, the$64,000 question always is, “whocan get the distance?” In the weeksleading up to this year’s Derby onMay 5, we’ll look at the pedigrees oftop contenders to determine whohas the stamina, and who doesn’t,to win the roses.\n\nIf seeing is believing, then anyone who saw Balto Star romp home last Saturday in the Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park has to believe he is one serious racehorse – who, seemingly overnight, stamped himself a dangerous contender for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nBalto Star wasn’t facing much in the Spiral, but the impressive thing wasn’t whom he beat but how he beat them. Making his first stakes appearance, the son of Glitterman took command at the start and never looked back, kicking away to win by 123/4 lengths in prime time of 1:47.1 for the mile and an eighth.\n\nThe huge margin was hardly a fluke. Last out, going a mile and a sixteenth over Aqueduct’s inner dirt track, Balto Star romped by 121/4 lengths. And two starts before that, at a mile and 70 yards over the Big A’s IDT, he broke his maiden by 11.\n\nThis is a colt who, as a 2-year-old, finished eighth, fifth and fourth in three starts. Why the sudden turnaround?\n\nSimple. Balto Star is no longer a colt, he’s a gelding. Before he was cut, being a racehorse was the last thing on his mind. Now, his studdish behavior a thing of the past, Balto Star has emerged a running fool.\n\nThe comparisons between Balto Star and Prairie Bayou, champion 3-year-old of 1993, are obvious. Both were geldings. Both started their classic campaigns at Aqueduct in the winter. Both won the Spiral (in 1993, it was called the Jim Beam).\n\nPrairie Bayou, favored in the Kentucky Derby, finished second, the victim of a long-standing jinx: No gelding has won the Derby since Clyde Van Dusen in 1929 (although Best Pal and Cavonnier also finished second over the past 10 years).\n\nIt’s no accident that a gelding hasn’t won the Derby since Hoover was president. As a rule they are slower to develop, which is why they’re gelded in the first place, and so they’re not ready to face the best 3-year-old colts going a mile and a quarter the first Saturday in May.\n\nPedigree-wise, Balto Star has his pluses and minuses.\n\nHis sire, Glitterman, was a pure sprinter – he never won a stakes longer than six furlongs – whose top offspring also are sprinters, such as Glitter Woman, JJ’sdream and Texas Glitter.\n\nGlitterman was bred to be a sprinter. His grandsire is the speedy Bold Ruler, who didn’t stay a mile and a quarter in the Derby, and his dam is a half-sister to champion sprinter Rubiano.\n\nFurthermore, Glitterman’s broodmare sire, In Reality, was a miler who sired sprinters and milers. In Reality’s sire Intentionally was another sprint champ.\n\nIn short, there’s not much stamina in Glitterman’s family tree.\n\nOn the other hand, Balto Star’s female branch does have plenty of stamina and a ton of class. His broodmare sire, Devil’s Bag, is by Halo (sire of Derby winners Sunny’s Halo and Sunday Silence) out of a mare by long-winded French champion Herbager. Balto Star’s second dam is by Stage Door Johnny, who won the Belmont Stakes and was a great source of stamina at stud. His third and fourth dams were sired by Northern Dancer and Swaps, both Kentucky Derby winners.\n\nTop horses produced by Balto Star’s female family include champion fillies Tempest Queen and Beautiful Pleasure, Belmont Stakes winner Bold Reason, champion Never Bend and the top stakes winner No Robbery.\n\nBalto Star’s dosage numbers – a profile of 10-3-10-3-2, an index of 1.80 – indicate a horse who can handle a mile and a quarter with ease. But can a gelding who didn’t even win his first race until Jan. 1 be ready to get that distance just 5½ weeks from now against potential monsters like Point Given, AP Valentine, Monarchos, Hero’s Tribute and Dollar Bill?\n\nNot unless he’s a superhorse and then some. Remember, in the 1973 Derby even the mighty gelding Forego could only finish fourth."
