        "text": "Sunny’s Halo, the 1983 Kentucky Derby winner, was euthanized Tuesday because of old age.\n\nThe 23-year-old stallion was found lying down in his paddock by longtime handler Dwayne “Pete” Sackett, who suspected that the horse had lost all strength in his hind legs.\n\nAfter efforts to help him stand up proved futile, he was euthanized.\n\n“He was such a tremendous horse and we did not want him to suffer,” said Billy Hanna of Houston, majority partner in the group that originally brought the stallion to Texas in 1998.\n\nSunny’s Halo was named Canada’s champion 2-year-colt in 1982 after winning four stakes at Woodbine. The following year he came to the United States and won the Arkansas Derby and Rebel Handicap. Eddie Delahoussaye rode Sunny’s Halo to a two-length victory in the 1983 Kentucky Derby, making him and 1964 champion Northern Dancer the only Canadian-breds to win the race.\n\nSunny’s Halo was retired at the end of his 3-year-old season with a record of 20-9-3-2 and $1,247,791 in earnings. He sired 36 stakes winners, including Dispersal, Sunny Sunrise, Irgun and Beautiful Sensation."
