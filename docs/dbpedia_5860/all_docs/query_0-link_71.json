        "text": "Throughout the Kentucky Oaks and Derby festivities, we – the Derby Dreamers – can mix and match with our counterparts from around the world! The sweet spot for meeting, eating, and tweeting is Sunny’s Halo Lounge, right above our Section 328 seats.\n\nA prime place for mingling\n\nThis 13,000-square-foot outdoor rooftop party deck, dubbed a “deluxe hospitality venue,” opened just last year. It looms high atop the grandstand with the gigantic new Big Board in full view (see previous post). Our seats – and our vantage point from Sunny’s Halo Lounge – bring us a sweeping view of the track’s far turn and upper stretch. These can be the most critical zones in the race to the finish line.\n\nBuffet and horse play\n\nOpen-seating tables await us, along with lunch buffet, beer, wine and soft drinks – all complimentary – plus cocktails, like Oaks Lilies and Derby Mint Juleps, served up for a few extra bucks. While lunching and lounging, we’ll continue to share predictions, bet on the races, and take in every moment of the action.\n\nNamed after a superstar\n\nThe lounge takes its name from champion Sunny’s Halo, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1983 with jockey Eddie Delahoussaye aboard. Sunny’s Halo was only the second Canadian-bred horse to win the Run for the Roses. As is true for many thoroughbreds, his name cleverly combined the name of his sire, Halo, with that of his dam, Mostly Sunny.\n\n“Standing at stud”\n\nA year of Derby delight was also one of disappointment for Sunny’s Halo. Toward the end of 2003, a recurring ankle problem ended his racing days. He soon launched a second career (and some might argue, a more satisfying one), standing at stud on a ranch in Lexington, KY. Next stop, Texas, where he became the state’s all-time leading sire by progeny earnings – a cool $26 million! Sunny’s Halo continued his studly ways until his passage in 2003 to that “big racetrack in the sky.” His remains are interred at Churchill Downs in the Kentucky Derby Museum.\n\nCelebrity visitations\n\nWho’s around the corner at Sunny’s Halo Lounge? Keep looking! Stars spotted lounge side at last year’s Derby weekend made for a lively mix. Actress Nichole Galicia of the film “Django Unchained.” A cluster of Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. And iconic jockeys Pat Day and Chris McCarron.\n\nHere’s wishing us a sunny Derby – topped off by a shiny halo!\n\nPhoto credits: www.kentuckyderbyexperience.com, horseracinghalloffame.com"
