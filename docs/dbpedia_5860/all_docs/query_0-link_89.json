Kentucky Derby winner Sunny's Halo was the picture of good health as he zipped through an excellent workout (five furlongs in 5- 3/5 seconds) yesterday morning at Woodbine. Jockey Robin Platts was aboard and said the Canadian colt was 'relaxed; really relaxed' Sunny's Halo had been sidelined with an ankle injury."
