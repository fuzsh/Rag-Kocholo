        "text": "This Saturday marks the 141st running of the Kentucky Derby, arguably the single most famous horse race in the world. But these thoroughbreds aren’t just elite in terms of their speed and agility — the Derby represents the very best of this world of wonderfully weird racehorse names in which we are so, so lucky to live.\n\nHere are the names of all 140 Kentucky Derby-winning horses in history, ranked in approximate order of how much they delight us.\n\n140. Hindoo (1881)\n\nToday, “Hindoo” is considered a racial slur. So, that’s a hard pass.\n\n139. Agile (1905)\n\n“Agile?” Show me, don’t tell me, buddy.\n\n138. Charismatic (1999)\n\n[See above.]\n\n137. Winning Colors (1988)\n\nIt’s a bold move to name your horse Winning anything, but a bold move that pays off when she actually does.\n\n136. Ferdinand (1986)\n\nHere is a cooler horse name, off the top of my head for free: Magellan. Come on, guys.\n\n135. Clyde Van Dusen (1929)\n\nThis horse was named after his trainer. To make things even more confusing, his maternal grandfather’s name was Uncle.\n\n134. Funny Cide (2003)\n\nWe prefer Funny Cide’s dad’s name: Distorted Humor.\n\n133. Real Quiet (1998)\n\nShhh.\n\n132. Donerail (1913)\n\nA forgettable name, but an unforgettable race. With the odds set at 91-1, Donerail’s win remains the biggest long-shot upset in Derby history.\n\n131. Donau (1910)\n\nDonau’s German owner gave his horse the deutsch name for the Danube River.\n\n130. Meridian (1911)\n\nA horse in his prime.\n\n129. Count Fleet (1943)\n\nBorn to Reigh Count and Quickly, Count Fleet would go on to win the Triple Crown that year.\n\n128. Azra (1892)\n\nAll right.\n\n127. Johnstown (1939)\n\nEh.\n\n126. Chateaugay (1963)\n\nChateaugay was named for a town in upstate New York.\n\n125. Alysheba (1987)\n\nNot bad.\n\n124. Cannonade (1974)\n\nDelicious, refreshing cannonade.\n\n123. Worth (1912)\n\nAs you might imagine, this horse isn’t terribly easy to Google.\n\n122. Affirmed (1978)\n\nOkay.\n\n121. Apollo (1882)\n\nYou can’t go wrong with Greek mythology.\n\n120. Hill Gail (1952)\n\nWhy not?\n\n119. Fonso (1880)\n\nHe was named for his sire, King Alfonso, but Mom had the best name in the whole damn family: Weatherwitch.\n\n118. Sunday Silence (1989)\n\nAlso a good name for a Morrissey song.\n\n117. Chant (1894)\n\nYup.\n\n116. Riley (1890)\n\nMore than a century before Riley would become a trendy baby name, it was a trendy horse name.\n\n115. Halma (1895)\n\nOkay.\n\n114. Ben Ali (1886)\n\nBen Ali was named after his owner, James Ben Ali Haggin.\n\n113. Spend A Buck (1985)\n\nSpend a buck, earn $2.6 million in a single race (an American record).\n\n112. Cavalcade (1934)\n\nYes.\n\n111. I’ll Have Another (2012)\n\nHere’s an adorable origin story: I’ll Have Another was named after his owner’s response whenever his wife offers him more cookies.\n\n110. Riva Ridge (1972)\n\nThis horse was named in honor of the owner’s son-in-law, who climbed Italy’s Riva Ridge while serving in WWII.\n\n109. Animal Kingdom (2011)\n\nThe only Kentucky Derby winner to share his name with a Walt Disney World theme park.\n\n108. Street Sense (2007)\n\nStreet Sense is a fun name, but his mother had an even better name: Bedazzle.\n\n107. War Emblem (2002)\n\nNo, he’s not related to either War Admiral or Man O’War, two of the approximately six racehorses you’ve ever heard of.\n\n106. Giacomo (2005)\n\nSure. Pretty good horse name.\n\n105. Pleasant Colony (1981)\n\nThis sounds like an Isaac Asimov short story that ends with humans becoming subservient to their smarthomes.\n\n104. Kingman (1891)\n\nNeither a king nor a man, but definitely a horse.\n\n103. Reigh Count (1928)\n\nWe don’t know who or what a “Reigh” is, but we like how it sounds. At least, we like the way we think it would sound?\n\n102. Swale (1984)\n\nWhat?\n\n101. Super Saver (2010)\n\nCome on down to Super Saver, where everything’s 99 cents!\n\n100. Barbaro (2006)\n\nThis late, beloved horse was named after a portrait of a foxhound named Barbaro in his owners’ home.\n\n99. Smarty Jones (2004)\n\nThe owner’s mother’s nickname was Smarty Jones, which may actually be an even better person name than it is a horse name. (Still: it is a very solid horse name.)\n\n98. Shut Out (1942)\n\nWe’ll take it.\n\n97. California Chrome (2014)\n\nSure, alliteration is easy, but it works.\n\n96. Bubbling Over (1926)\n\nMuch like the celebratory champagne that no doubt followed his win.\n\n95. Morvich (1922)\n\nThis horse had a fine name, but he pales in comparison to his grandfathers: Dr. Leggo and Voter.\n\n94. Carry Back (1961)\n\nCarry Back is a fine name, but it’s downright disappointing when you consider that his parents were named Saggy and Joppy.\n\n93. Venetian Way (1960)\n\nEurope? Europe!\n\n92. Old Rosebud (1914)\n\nThis horse was named after his owner’s family farm.\n\n91. Montrose (1887)\n\nNot to be confused with the Mount Rose American Teen Princess.\n\n90. Silver Charm (1997)\n\nThat sounds nice.\n\n89. Canonero II (1971)\n\n“Cañonero” is Spanish for “gunboat.” “II” is Spanish for “II.”\n\n88. Fusaichi Pegasus (2000)\n\nIt feels little misleading to name a non-winged horse Pegasus, but we appreciate what they were going for.\n\n87. Grindstone (1996)\n\nOkay!\n\n86. Go for Gin (1994)\n\nConveniently, there is no faster way to go for gin than on the back of a speeding horse.\n\n85. Sea Hero (1993)\n\nHorses: the heroes of the sea.\n\n84. Unbridled (1990)\n\nTechnically false, but still a cool name.\n\n83. Sunny’s Halo (1983)\n\nSunny’s Halo sounds like a very sad children’s book where everything seems like it’s going great when suddenly the main character’s best friend drowns in a creek.\n\n82. Spectacular Bid (1979)\n\nGood, but perhaps not spectacular.\n\n81. Bold Venture (1936)\n\nThis is a good name.\n\n80. Bold Forbes (1976)\n\nBut this is a marginally better name.\n\n79. Secretariat (1973)\n\nThe first five names under which this famous horse, born to the delightfully named Somethingroyal, was registered weren’t approved.\n\n78. George Smith (1916)\n\nThis horse was named after noted racing enthusiast and rich person George E. Smith.\n\n77. Strike the Gold (1991)\n\nAlso a good name for a bowling team.\n\n76. Big Brown (2008)\n\nPoints for accurate self-description.\n\n75. Forward Pass (1968)\n\nForward Pass’s name makes us think that somebody behind the scenes had aspirations of producing an equine version of Air Bud.\n\n74. Seattle Slew (1977)\n\nThis horse’s name was originally Seattle Slough, until the owners (correctly) realized that no one would ever be able to spell that.\n\n73. Iron Liege (1957)\n\nNow we’re getting somewhere.\n\n72. Lil E. Tee (1992)\n\nThat’s E. Tee as in Steven Spielberg’s E.T., because this horse was ugly and shy yet altogether totally lovable as a foal.\n\n71. Swaps (1955)\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n70. Middleground (1950)\n\nWhen you’re pretty sure your horse isn’t coming in last, but you don’t think he’s going to win, either.\n\n69. Buchanan (1884)\n\nOur most presidential Kentucky Derby winner.\n\n68. Ponder (1949) [Tie]\n\nPensive (1944) [Tie]\n\nPlaudit (1898) [Tie]\n\nIt’s a three-way tie for the SAT vocab horse names that start with P.\n\n65. Ben Brush (1896)\n\nThis horse is named after the superintendent who’d granted his owners difficult-to-come-by stall space at the Gravesend race track in Brooklyn.\n\n64. Alan-a-Dale (1902)\n\nAccording to legend, Alan-a-Dale was a minstrel and a member of Robin Hood’s Merry Men.\n\n63. Paul Jones (1920)\n\nThis horse has at least one thing in common with at least one member of Led Zeppelin—he was named for naval hero John Paul Jones.\n\n62. Northern Dancer (1964)\n\nHold me closer, Northern Dancer.\n\n61. Proud Clairon (1967)\n\nThis is a good, appropriately fancy name.\n\n60. Assault (1946)\n\nA little aggro, but sure.\n\n59. Exterminator (1918)\n\n[See above.]\n\n58. Hoop Jr. (1945)\n\nWe like this name even more now that we’ve learned that, technically, there was no Hoop Senior. Hoop Jr.’s sire was named Sir Gallahad III; his owner was Fred W. Hooper.\n\n57. Monarchos (2001)\n\nLike a beautiful, 1,000-pound butterfly.\n\n56. Whirlaway (1941)\n\nRemember Sky Dancers? There is a 90% chance that some marketing wonk lobbied to call them Whirlaways instead.\n\n55. Thunder Gulch (1995)\n\nThis sounds like a long-lost AC/DC album, which is to say: badass.\n\n54. Lawrin (1938)\n\nIt is genuinely astonishing that there isn’t a USA Network series called Lawrin about a lawyer named Lauren.\n\n53. War Admiral (1937)\n\nAwesome name, awesome horse.\n\n52. Omaha (1935) [Tie]\n\nSpokane (1889) [Tie]\n\nAsking us to choose between Omaha and Spokane is like asking us to choose between our children, or our two favorite mid-size American cities.\n\n50. Kauai King (1966)\n\nDespite what you might guess from his name, this horse wasn’t bred in Hawaii, but in Maryland, the Hawaii of the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n49. Brokers Tip (1933)\n\nWe love a pointlessly meta name. I’m sorry, but which horse did the broker tip?\n\n48. Twenty Grand (1931)\n\nDespite his name, he’d earn more than $260,000 in his career.\n\n47. Flying Ebony (1925)\n\nAll right!\n\n46. Genuine Risk (1980)\n\nSounds like an ’80s action thriller starring Bruce Willis and/or Mel Gibson.\n\n45. Leonatus (1883)\n\nNot only is a Leonatus a cool name, but this guy proved himself to be a true horse’s horse when he ate the roses that are traditionally draped on the Kentucky Derby winner.\n\n44. Black Gold (1924)\n\nOtherwise known as Texas tea.\n\n43. Zev (1923)\n\nThe first horse with a three-letter name to win the Derby, but not the last.\n\n42. Behave Yourself (1921)\n\nGood advice.\n\n41. Needles (1956)\n\nThis is, objectively, a garbage name for a horse, which is exactly why we love it. Needles’ mother was named Noodle Soup.\n\n40. Gallahadion (1940)\n\nKing Arthur’s Round Table… but in the future.\n\n39. Sir Barton (1919) [Tie]\n\nSir Huon (1906) [Tie]\n\nFun fact: If a horse should be knighted, he is considered a human being and liable for taxes in the eyes of the British legal system.\n\n37. Gato Del Sol (1982)\n\nI like your style, Sun Cat.\n\n36. Lieutenant Gibson (1900)\n\nWe imagine this was Mr. Ed’s highfalutin cousin.\n\n35. Mine That Bird (2009)\n\nMine That Bird sounds like a super-fun iPhone game that I would be terrible at.\n\n34. Joe Cotton (1885)\n\nJoe Cotton’s grandfather was named Macaroni. That’s not a joke of any kind; that’s just a wonderful fact.\n\n33. Aristides (1875)\n\nThe first-ever Kentucky Derby winner was named after a statesman in ancient Athens.\n\n32. Jet Pilot (1947)\n\nActor Jason Lee has a son named Pilot Inspektor, so there is at least one horse with a less strange name than at least one human.\n\n31. Wintergreen (1909)\n\nRefreshing!\n\n30. Omar Khayyam (1917)\n\nBecause why not name your horse after a Persian mathematician born a millennium ago?\n\n29. Elwood (1904)\n\nElwood is an important name in the world of animal achievements. A canine Elwood won the World’s Ugliest Dog Contest in 2007.\n\n28. Baden-Baden (1877)\n\nThe horse so nice they named him twice, but not quite nice enough to justify naming him a third time.\n\n27. Manuel (1899)\n\nTo date, the only Kentucky Derby-winning horse to share his name with a character from Fawlty Towers.\n\n26. Stone Street (1908)\n\nGood job.\n\n25. Judge Himes (1903)\n\nJust saying: a daytime court show presided over by a horse judge would kill.\n\n24. Lookout (1893)\n\nYes.\n\n23. Typhoon II (1897)\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more awesome name than Typhoon II, with the possible exception of the yet-to-exist Typhoon III.\n\n22. Majestic Prince (1969)\n\nSurely the best kind of prince.\n\n21. Regret (1915)\n\nThis filly with a delightfully bizarre name was the first of just three female horses in history to win the Kentucky Derby.\n\n20. Lucky Debonair (1965)\n\nIf Cary Grant were a Kentucky Derby-winning racehorse, he would be Lucky Debonair.\n\n19. Gallant Fox (1930)\n\nIf Cary Grant were a Kentucky Derby-winning racehorse and had also risen from the dead to make an appearance in Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox, he would be Gallant Fox.\n\n18. Tim Tam (1958)\n\nGreat job.\n\n17. Determine (1954)\n\nInexplicable, standalone verbs are highly underrated as horse names.\n\n16. Decidedly (1962)\n\nThe same goes for inexplicable, standalone adverbs.\n\n15. Foolish Pleasure (1975)\n\nThis is a Lifetime movie we would definitely watch.\n\n14. Dark Star (1953)\n\nNot to be confused with the John Carpenter movie of the same name, released in 1974.\n\n13. Pink Star (1907)\n\nNot to be confused with the 60-carat diamond of the same name, which sold at auction for more than $83 million in 2013.\n\n12. Day Star (1878)\n\nFighter of the Night Star.\n\n11. Whiskery (1927)\n\nA horse-cat hybrid with a face full of whiskers would either be adorable or terrifying. Be careful out there, geneticists.\n\n10. Dust Commander (1970)\n\nIf the Swiffer company had been around in the 1970s, I’d like to think that nothing would have stopped them from sponsoring this horse.\n\n9. Count Turf (1951)\n\nLeast scary vampire ever.\n\n8. His Eminence (1901)\n\nAccording to turn-of-the-century etiquette, this is how all racehorses are to be addressed.\n\n7. Lord Murphy (1879)\n\nThis horse was originally named Patmus. Lord Murphy is definitely an upgrade.\n\n6. Citation (1948)\n\nThe favorite horse of anal retentive graduate students everywhere.\n\n5. Burgoo King (1932)\n\nThis is a fabulous name. “Burgoo” is named for the traditional Kentucky stew, but we’d love to believe that Burgoo King : Burger King :: McDowell’s : McDonald’s.\n\n4. Tomy Lee (1959)\n\nNo relation.\n\n3. Vagrant (1876)\n\nVagrant comes from an amazing pedigree of crazy names. His grandfather was named Vandal and his mother was named Lazy.\n\n2. Macbeth II (1888)\n\nIf you enjoyed the Scottish play, just wait till you see the sequel.\n\n1. Orb (2013)\n\nTo paraphrase the podcast My Brother My Brother and Me, Orb is horse. Horse is orb.\n\nMolly Fitzpatrick is senior editor of Fusion’s Pop & Culture section. Her interests include movies about movies, TV shows about TV shows, and movies about TV shows, but not so much TV shows about movies."
