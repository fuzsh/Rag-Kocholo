        "text": "I posted this in racing but only got one reply, thought I’d try here:\n\nI am looking at a gelding for a possible low level sporthorse/everyday Joe mount. His sire is More than Ready by Southern Halo out of Woodmans Girl by Woodman: his dam is by Unbridled’s Song by Unbridled and out of Pennys Fortune by Storm Cat.\n\nI don’t know anything about these lines, really. I don’t care about the race record (I know Unbridled was a Derby winner); I just want to know what these horses “generally” tend to be like.\n\nThis gelding only raced 3 times - last one being the beginning of his 3 y/o year and that was that. He never broke maiden and apparently showed no interest whatsoever.\n\nI’ve been told by the seller that he’s pretty quiet, takes new things in stride and thoughtfully, has an honest spook (isn’t dirty). He’s on the smaller side which is what I’m looking for.\n\nI just know that Halo was a psycho and seemed to pass that down. So were other members of this gelding’s pedigree (Woodman, Storm Cat). I will judge the individual in front of me, but … ??\n\nThoughts anyone?\n\nThanks!\n\nI can’t find much online about the temperament of his get, probably because most race breeders aren’t much considering temperament.\n\nHe is mentioned here;https://www.paulickreport.com/news/r…-sport-horses/\n\nHere is an article about More Than Ready; http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com…requent-flyer/\n\nHere is his walking video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X1pvFdrd3I\n\nHopefully someone with actual experience with his lines will be able to tell you more.\n\nHave you seen the horse? If so, what was your impression?\n\n@skydy thank you for your response. The article about More Than Ready was a great read - sounds like he missed the psycho Halo gene.\n\nI have not yet seen the horse, am supposed to next weekend. Guess we’ll see what we see.\n\nDo let us know what impression he makes. Since the seller has admitted an honest spook, ask straight away if he has been tranquilized when you see him… Hopefully you will be able to ride the horse before buying him.\n\nThe dam has an influence of course, so if temperament is very high on your list you might want to find her connections and inquire about her and the temperament of her offspring.\n\nMore Than Ready seems to have a good mind and, at least, is not infamous for being a rogue.\n\nMore Than Ready has plenty of workmanlike, professional horses. I would assess the individual before going to the pedigree.\n\nI give all accounts of stallions being purported psychos a hefty grain of salt especially if they were born before 2000. So much in care, management and upkeep has changed since then and just about any horse, even a good one, can be rendered “psychotic” by committing to the work and management schedule that stallions have to endure.\n\n@skydy & @beowulf doesn’t matter now, the horse sold yesterday. It wasn’t meant to be! Which is really okay with me as I adore my current mount…even if he is knocking on retirement’s door.\n\nOh well,thanks for letting us know. I was looking forward to a photo.\n\nMore Than Ready is a nice looking guy.\n\nOne of my best and all time favorite horses had Halo up close. He was super easy to retrain from racing and was the horse I could put my older beginner mother on for a trail ride through open country. Not just a good egg…the best egg. I still miss him (got kicked in the pasture and broke his leg).\n\nDont worry or judge a gelding by his pedigree…look at the horse in front of you.\n\nHa, and I was going to go on and on about how much I LOVED the MTR I used to ride! Go shopping for another one so I can live vicariously :winkgrin:\n\n@kremeroyale I actually did find a filly who has MTR as her grandsire… LOL.\n\nI understand that both Halo and Woodman have bad reputations anecdotally… That being said my new prospect is by MTR son Ready’s Image and definitely looks like that side of the family. He’s a big dark handsome guy with quite a good brain. Any thoughts on Manila in a sport horse pedigree?\n\nhttp://www.pedigreequery.com/pacemakestherace"
