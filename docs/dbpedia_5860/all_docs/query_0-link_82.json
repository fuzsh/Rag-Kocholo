        "text": "Firingtothefront\n\n​​2018 Kentucky-bred Filly by Firing Line out of Damsel In Front (Super Saver)\n\nOn closing day of the four day Ocala Breeders' Sale (OBS), we secured hip #933. The filly worked one furlong in 10.1 during the breeze show, and looks to be a speedy daughter of new sire Firing Line. The dam of our newest filly, Damsel In Front, is the daughter of multiple graded stakes winner Super Saver. The young two year-old was in the barn of trainer Justin Jeansonne.\n\nFiringtothefront finished 4th in a Maiden Special Weight at Fair Grounds, after setting the early pace. (2/13/21)\n\nFiringtothefront missed the break in a classy MSW field at Fair Grounds and finished 7th. (3/20/21)\n\nFiringtothefront finished 3rd in a rail trip at Louisiana Downs in MSW company. (5/3/21)\n\nFiringtothefront finished 2nd as the beaten favorite in a turf route. (5/30/21)\n\nFiringtothefront broke her maiden by two lengths at Louisiana Downs going a route. (6/22/21)\n\nShe was claimed away in her maiden victory. The speedy filly was a true professional.\n\n5 Starts - 1 - 1 - 1\n\nHer Kare\n\n2016 ​​Kentucky-bred Filly by Central Banker out of Headstrong Beauty (Latent Heat)\n\nWe won a 3-way shake for three year-old Kentucky-bred filly Her Kare at Delta Downs The well bred 2016 filly is by graded stakes winner Central Banker and out of the Latent Heat mare Headstrong Beauty. The filly broke her maiden in her second career start at Churchill Downs and crossed the finish line first in the race we claimed her, her third career start, but she was disqualified for drifting out and placed third. In her second start off of our claim, she scored a nice 2+ length win at Delta Downs (December 14, 2019). She followed up that win with an impressive 4+ length win again at Delta Downs (December 27, 2019). We enjoyed having the filly in our stable. She was in the barn of trainer Justin Jeansonne.\n\n3 Starts 2 - 0 - 0.\n\nCaliente Candy\n\n2016 ​Kentucky-bred Filly by Sidney's Candy out of Nicks (Salt Lake)\n\nWe won a 6-way shake in our successful claim of Caliente Candy at Fair Grounds (February 21, 2019). The well bred 2016 Kentucky-bred filly is by multiple graded stakes winner Sidney's Candy and out of the Salt Lake mare Nicks who is a multiple stakes winner and producer of two other foals who are both winners.\n\nWe have high hopes for the young filly, who picked up back-to-back wins for us at Oaklawn Park in her first runs off of our Fair Grounds claim. She followed up those wins with an impressive victory in her debut run at historic Churchill Downs. With a win at Ellis Park in Allowance company (July 6, 2019), a win at Remington Park (September 19, 2019) and a solid third place finish in the Flash Lady Stakes at Remington Park (September 29, 2019), she has proven to be an excellent sprinter.\n\nShe closed out the year when she picked up her sixth win for us when she won a stakes caliber Allowance sprint at Remington Park (December 12, 2019). The speedy filly has wins at four different tracks in three different states since our February 2019 claim.\n\nAfter a successful 2019 campaign with trainer Danny Pish, she moved to the barn of trainer Donnie K. Von Hemel, where she opened the 2020 Oaklawn meet with a thrilling photo finish win in Starter Allowance company (February 6, 2020). In her first run after nearly six month since her last race, she finished third (3rd) in Allowance Company for trainer Danny Pish (September 12, 2020). Caliente Candy notched her first career stakes win in the Flashy Lady Stakes (September 27, 2020). Caliente Candy followed up her stakes win with an impressive win in Allowance company (November 16, 2020). It was her 10th career win (9th with our partnership).\n\nCaliente Candy ended her career by being named the 2020 Remington Park Champion Older Female (December 23, 2020) She was truly a joy to own.\n\n17 Starts - 9 (1) - 1 - 4(1)\n\nVIDEO: 2020 Flashy Lady Stakes - 9/27/20\n\nAngel's Cut\n\n​​2016 Kentucky-bred Filly by Dominus out of Raise You Up (Blue Grass Cat)\n\nWe claimed 2016 Kentucky-bred filly Angel's Cut out of her ninth career start at Fair Grounds in New Orleans. The well bred filly is by multiple graded stakes winner Dominus and out of the Blue Grass Cat mare Raise You Up. She broke a step slow in her last race, was bumped out of the gate and checked twice on a forced 5th place rail trip throughout. It was a classic \"bad trip\" for her that day as the 7/5 past time favorite. We look forward to watching her develop for us. In her first run off the claim, she finished a nice closing third (3rd) over a sloppy track at Fair Grounds (February 20, 2020). In her second start for us, she picked up the WIN battling in a speed duel early and digging in gamely for the win after being headed down the stretch (March 18, 2020). She finished a very good second (2nd) to the very fast closing post time favorite in her first run at Will Rogers Downs (WRD) for trainer Dena Thomas (April 6, 2020). She was claimed away after the WRD debut effort.\n\n3 Starts 1 - 1 - 1\n\nAmoreena Star\n\n2018 ​​Louisiana-bred Filly by Star Guitar out of Missed Ours (Half Ours)\n\nOn closing day of the three day July Ocala Breeders' Sale (OBS), we secured Hip #922. The Louisiana-bred filly worked one furlong in 10.4 during the breeze show. She is the well bred daughter of 4-time Louisiana-bred Horse of the Year and 2019 Louisiana Stallion of the Year, Star Guitar. The dam (Missed Ours) of our new filly is the daughter of 4-time Louisiana Stallion of the Year, Half Ours. The promising young 2yo, who was bred by Brittlyn Stables, will be in the barn of trainer Justin Jeansonne. Amoreena Star won in her career debut at Fair Ground by one length. She was claimed away by new connections out of the debut win.\n\n1 Start - 1 - 0 - 0\n\n2014 Kentucky-bred Filly by Kitten's Joy out of Northeast Harbor (Northern Afleet)\n\nHopeful Joy was a 2014 Kentucky-bred filly we partnered in claiming at Fair Grounds in New Orleans with our friends at Horseplayers Racing Club in 2017. We won a 5-way shake for her. The well bred filly is by perennial leading sire Kitten's Joy. She passed through the Keeneland Sales ring twice, once for $145,000 and again for $100,000. The versatile filly won three races in a row for us immediately after our claim. After suffering an injury, she made a brief return to racing, but we decided to retire her and sell privately after her last run for us. She should make an excellent broodmare. We look forward to seeing her offspring run..​\n\n6 Starts 3 - 0 - 1"
