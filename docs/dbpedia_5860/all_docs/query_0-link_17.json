        "text": "The round man with the jolly disposition was trying to get home to Canada. The only way to get there from Arkansas was to fly south the wrong direction but David Foster didn't seem to mind the Sunday after the Arkansas Derby.\n\nA stewardess took note of the man and his wife and several small grandchildren and offered to assist them aboard the airplane. He agreed and handed her several carry-on bags. Then he reached under his seat and hauled up a mammoth gold trophy that looked as if it might not fit any place aboard a passenger plane, much less under a seat.\n\n\"What's that thing?\" the stewardess asked, eyeing the trophy as if it might explode any second.\n\n\"We won the Arkansas Derby,\" David Foster said cheerfully. \"And we're going to win the Kentucky Derby, too.\"\n\nShe smiled but looked unconvinced. Even an airline stewardess who probably wouldn't know a thoroughbred from sourdough bread seemed skeptical. And why not?\n\nWho, after all, would think a Cajun jockey aboard a Canadian horse who had run only two races all year and both in Arkansas was going to win the Run for the Roses?\n\nBut Saturday afternoon at Churchill Downs, Canadians and Cajuns and Arkies came together in victory. After so many failures, Sunny's Halo finally made an Arkansas Derby champion a Kentucky Derby winner.\n\nIn a fashion similar to his wire-to-wire triumph last month at Oaklawn Park, Sunny's Halo became only the second Canadian horse in history Saturday to win the world's most famous horse race. Eddie Delahoussaye, his Cajun jockey, meanwhile became only the fourth race rider ever to win back-to-back Derbies.\n\nA year ago Delahoussaye was first aboard Gato Del Sol, who came from dead last in a 20-horse field to win easily. But that experience meant nothing Saturday for Delahoussaye. Sunny's Halo was never more than half a length off the early pace set by Total Departure and had the race completely in hand as the two came splashing through the rain like a couple of kids at recess.\n\nThere are over 35,000 thoroughbred racehorses foaled on this continent annually and every one of those owners would have changed places Saturday with David Foster, an Ontario stockbroker. Sunny's Halo just made him a millionaire. David Cross, the Canadian trainer, also became the envy of his peers and the man in racing with the most horse sense in 1983.\n\nThere certainly were a number of obstacles that Foster, Cross and Sunny's Halo had to overcome. The stigma about Canadian horses. The brand of \"loser\" placed on Arkansas Derby champions. And the light work this spring for Sunny's Halo. Sunny's Halo became the lightest raced Kentucky Derby winner since 1947's Jet Pilot, who also had just two starts.\n\nThis victory was obviously pleasing for Foster, who had never had a horse in the Derby before. But it was a personal triumph for Cross, who had saddled a couple of horses at Churchill Downs 12 years ago but failed so badly that he ran away.\n\nDavid Cross is a rather mysterious fellow and little known in his profession. He was born on a track in British Columbia and for a while was an unsuccessful rider. He wears dark glasses even when the sun is not shining and has little to say.\n\nBut he knows his racing and apparently has an inner toughness about him. He made it clear after the Arkansas Derby that he would chart the path for Sunny's Halo. Not Foster.\n\nIf so, there will be no Triple Crown winner this year. Cross said in Arkansas that Sunny's Halo would not run under any circumstances in June's 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. \"It's too far for a horse that age carrying 126 pounds,\" he said.\n\nOf course should Sunny's Halo win the Preakness, perhaps Cross could be overruled by Foster. But you doubt it. Foster had insisted that Sunny's Halo run seven races as a two-year-old and the Canadian juvenile champ ended up with sore legs. Mincing no words, Cross said this week the reason was \"greed\" that the colt raced so often. To get Sunny's Halo well, Cross took him to California for the winter, where he spent his time in a swimming pool healing bucked shins and a bad ankle.\n\nIt was Cross who decided that Sunny's Halo would go to Arkansas, pretty much an uncharted course for the elite among three-year-old colts. It was his plan that Sunny's Halo would run only twice before the Derby. It was he who insisted that Delahoussaye get the ride, turning down an offer from Angel Cordero, Jr., who Cross said \"tried to put a gun to my head\" for the mount.\n\nAfter Sunny's Halo had won the Arkansas Derby last month, Foster and Cross and Delahoussaye were invited to a special party for the winners.\n\nA band was playing and the champaign was flowing when Cross walked in.\n\nA waiter offered him a glass of the bubbly, but he turned it down.\n\n\"I'll just stick to my (Johnny Walker) Red and water,\" he said, reaching in his back pocket.\n\nYou guess he probably toasted the Canadians, the Cajun and the Arkies with his own brand again Saturday.
