        "text": "My old horse trainer, one of the wisest people I ever met—and I find many trainers to be so wise, way beyond their formal educations—used to define stress this way: the confusion created when one's mind overrides the body's basic desire to choke the living [bleep] out of some [bleep] who so desperately needs it.\n\nAny trainer reading this will immediately recognize the sensation, surrounded as he or she is by countless other “experts” (at least in their own minds): regulators, do-gooders, gamblers, veterinarians, reporters, owners, blacksmiths, hotwalkers, entry clerks, and track officials—to name only a very few categories of her or his advisers.\n\nEveryone else in racing these days (not to mention virtually everyone else on Earth) is experiencing that same sensation. Our mutual feelings of stress are ubiquitous—that is to say, they’re everywhere in virtually everything we’re doing.\n\nI can remember a time, not that long ago, when people went to the races, or owned horses, to get away from politics. And stress. The objectivity of the photo-finish camera, invented nearly a century ago now, was a welcome relief from all the conflicting opinions outside the track enclosures. And my $2 was just as valuable as Mr. Vanderbilt’s.\n\nTo be certain, there have always been politics within racing—our own politics. And gradually, with politically appointed state regulators, non-racing politics, real politics, became more and more intrusive as the decades marched on.\n\nWhat we have witnessed in the last few years, however, is something new. Or, perhaps, a throwback to the early 1900s, when much of American racing was simply abolished in the name of “reform,” which a “reform” movement later led even to prohibition! It’s perhaps instructive that prohibition of alcoholic beverages ended about the same time that modern pari-mutuel betting on newly approved tracks began in the 1930s.\n\nI’m not sure that what we’re witnessing now in racing—the advent of national, federal legislation to accompany and supplant state-by-state regulation—will be as cataclysmic for racing as what happened before in the name of “reform,” but I’m also not sure that it won’t be.\n\nWhat it comes down to is this: how much reform did or does present-day racing really need? Are the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) and its bureaucratic bedfellows actually going to result in whatever reform is really necessary? Or, are we going to fail this stress test?\n\nThe Jockey Club and Breeders’ Cup—those august, elite, and self-righteous bodies who always claim to know what’s best for racing—now find themselves arrayed against the National Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association and the Association of Racing Commissioners International. The latter can be equally self-righteous and are accompanied by some state regulators, but have no august or elite pretensions. Quite the opposite, in fact, they claim to represent “the people.” Which is to say, bluntly, the non-elite. And let there be no mistake: in racing as in all things, the less-than-elite vastly outnumber the elite. The taking of sides we’re seeing leads to absurd ironies: one vocal HISA supporter dared to scorn the Kentucky HBPA for not being democratic enough . . . apparently not realizing that The Jockey Club, prime mover of HISA, is perhaps the least democratic organization on the globe, with the possible exception of the Catholic Church.\n\nSuch cycles have underpinned the development of the breed, initially allowing for more variety. When Never Say Die won the 1954 Epsom Derby under Lester Piggott, he became the first American-bred winner of the race since Iroquois in 1881.\n\nColumnist Frank Jennings, writing at the time in the Thoroughbred Record, noted that: “Never Say Die did a great deal toward changing this thought [that an American-bred would not be able to win the Epsom Derby] and at the same time provided a fine example of the fact that American bloodlines, when properly blended with those of foreign lands, can hold their own in the top company of the world.”\n\nJust over 40 years later, the race boasted a further 11 American-bred winners as well another, Nijinsky, who had been bred in Canada.\n\n“Properly blended” is a key phrase in Jennings’ text, with the industry’s global nature allowing for differing lines to blend in elsewhere to the point that it's not uncommon nowadays for a horse’s background to host European, North American, Japanese and/or Australian-bred names.\n\n“It is important not to underestimate just how much the mare population matters to a stallion,” says Bell, “and how he might blend. We stood Diesis at Mill Ridge Farm—he was a champion two-year-old in Britain by Sharpen Up; and when he came here, he was provided with those American speed mares. And it clicked; it worked for him.”\n\nAs Carty notes, Adena Springs’ stalwart Silent Name is another fine advertisement for a Thoroughbred melting pot. One of the first sons of Japanese supersire Sunday Silence to stand outside Japan, the Gr. 2 winner is a proven Gr. 1 stallion and sits perennially among the leading Canadian sires.\n\n“Silent Name was bred in Japan by the Wertheimer brothers from an European pedigree that had heavy doses of North American influences,” he says. “He’s out of a mare by Danehill, and his second dam is by Blushing Groom. You’ve got Raja Baba, a son of Bold Ruler, in there, too. So it’s a really international pedigree.\n\n“To build this kind of family requires the ability to think long term, and it’s a long process. Credit to the Wertheimer brothers as they had the vision and sight to send mares to Japan and tap into these different bloodlines. Credit to the Wildenstein family and Maria Niarchos for doing the same as well.”\n\nContraction\n\nAre we closing in on a situation where the breed might be contracting too much?\n\n“Any answer will be determined on what you are trying to breed,” says Craig. “A sound racehorse with a turn of foot or successful sales horse? Do you prefer to out-cross bloodlines, or are you happy to concentrate on currently successful bloodlines to meet market fashion and sell well?\n\n“For me, primarily trying to breed racehorses, I find it increasingly restrictive simply because so many of the broodmares are by or out of the current stallions. That is an increasing problem, and I see the same in yearlings at sales.\n\n“We can make statistics to say anything, but what they do show is that speed is essential for a racehorse. But class speed. Sadly we are now in a world where cheap speed sells, and class stamina is overlooked or not wanted at the sales.”\n\nThe power of the commercial market is certainly a factor.\n\nAs Bell notes, most breeders are in the position of having “to play the commercial card.”\n\n“The reduction of the foal crop is also something that’s at play here,” he says. “When you’re going down from 35,000 foals to 19,000, you’re going to get limitations. So we’re playing with the cards that we’re dealt.”\n\nAway from commercial dictations, the shift can also be attributed to the overwhelming influence of Northern Dancer, a great-great-grandson of Phalaris.\n\nBred by E.P. Taylor, it is part of racing folklore how the late May-foaled Northern Dancer was shunned by buyers on account of his size as a yearling yet went on to win the Kentucky Derby in record time several weeks short of his actual third birthday.\n\nThus began Gutiérrez’s association with Larrea, the billionaire who, racing in Mexico under the stable names of both Cuadra San Jorge and Cuadra G L, is the country’s dominant owner. Their affiliation began small, with Gutiérrez getting the lesser horses, until Larrea’s main trainer retired and Gutiérrez took over the primary role, which set him firmly on the path to becoming the country’s preeminent trainer.\n\nBut Las Americas was too small to contain his big dreams.\n\nOn April 28, 2017—his 50th birthday—Gutiérrez fulfilled one of those dreams: saddling a runner at Keeneland.\n\nHe’d looked through the spring meet condition book as soon as it came out to see what races were scheduled on his birthday, found one to target with Grosco, and called Keeneland-based trainer Ignacio Correas IV—who’d had a lot of success training in Argentina before moving to the U.S.—and asked for his help.\n\nGrosco was a Mexican-bred who had been claimed cheaply at Las Americas. The cost of travel, as Gutiérrez remembers it, was around $2,500 to get him to Kentucky, involving a 20-hour van ride from Mexico City to the border, three days of quarantine, and a 24-hour haul from Laredo to Lexington just to run in a $10,000 claiming race.\n\nWhy Grosco? It wasn’t so much that he was a particularly good horse but that the dark bay gelding held special meaning for his family. He’d been born at the farm where María Gutiérrez worked, and their son Andrés had helped foal Grosco. As far as Gutiérrez was concerned, it had to be that horse. “I wanted to see him in the Keeneland paddock,” he says.\n\nGrosco ran fifth of six. “¡No importa!” Gutiérrez says. It doesn’t matter! “When you get to Keeneland and you stand in the paddock beneath the trees, you can say, ‘Here I am. I made it.’ It’s important.”\n\nA second dream was fulfilled that same year when the Caribbean Series— alternatively known as the Serie Hipica del Caribe—was contested at Gulfstream instead of at one of the member jurisdiction racetracks where he’d already trained winners, including a Copa Velocidad in 2012 with Epifanio at Camarero in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. But Gutiérrez wanted to win on continental U.S. soil. In 2017 and 2018, the series’ first and second years at Gulfstream, he trained Jala Jala and Kukulkan, both Mexican-bred Horses of the Year, to win back-to-back Caribbean Classics for Larrea’s St. George Stable LLC (which is the English translation of Cuadra San Jorge). The same horses followed up with consecutive wins in the Copa Confraternidad del Caribe (recognized by The Jockey Club as the Confraternity Caribbean Cup the year Kukulkan won) for older horses in 2018 and 2019, respectively.\n\nUntil Letruska, Kukulkan, who in addition to being Horse of the Year was the divisional champion at two and three, was Gutiérrez’s best horse, and the trainer’s ambitious handling of that colt gives good insight into how he would go on to plan Letruska’s 2020 and 2021 campaigns.\n\nAfter winning the Caribbean Classic, which was Kukulkan’s first-ever line of internationally recognized black-type, by 10¼ lengths three years ago this December to remain undefeated, connections opted to keep the dark bay in Florida, targeting the Gr. 1 Pegasus World Cup Invitational the following January.\n\n“Kukulkan had done everything he needed to do in Mexico,” says Gutiérrez. “Then I had to face reality [in the U.S.], and reality is another thing. That’s why I felt that the Pegasus would be perfect for losing. I didn’t want to lose in a lesser race. I wanted to lose against the best.”\n\nThe son of Point Determined was 11th in the Pegasus but stayed in the States afterwards, eventually winning an allowance at Churchill, placing second in a Gr. 3 at Mountaineer, and third in a Listed race at Indiana Downs for Gutiérrez. Kukulkan closed out 2019 with the win in the Confraternity.\n\nMore importantly, the U.S. unveiling of St. George’s homebred Letruska, a winner of all six of her starts in Mexico, came in the Copa Invitacional del Caribe, a 10-furlong race for three-year-olds and up, two races after Kukulkan’s Confraternity. The only female entered, Letruska got out in front and never looked back, beating opponents, including older males, by 4¼ lengths.\n\nGutiérrez was in the process of establishing a small experimental U.S. division, anchored by Kukulkan, who’d already been in the country to begin with, and the up-and-comer Letruska at Palm Meadows Training Center. But as had happened with Kukulkan after the Pegasus 11 months earlier, some of the shine wore off the previously undefeated Letruska when she ran last of 13 in Gulfstream’s Tropical Park Oaks, her only try on grass, at the end of December in her next outing.\n\nSoon thereafter, in February 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Mexico. The emerging pandemic made a return home difficult when Las Americas stayed closed, and Gutiérrez was lucky to have the small stable he’d brought to Palm Meadows, although he hadn’t yet had a winner on the year. The trainer himself continued to travel between Florida and Mexico until March, when he brought Andrés with him on what was supposed to be a five-day trip. They never went back to Mexico again.\n\nBy summer, with racing at Las Americas at a standstill—the racetrack never did open at all that year—and Gutiérrez beginning to fear that the pandemic would close the border between the countries, his wife and daughter followed him and Andrés to the States. María and Ana arrived in time to go from the airport to Gulfstream to see Letruska win the Added Elegance Stakes on June 27th, the trainer’s eighth win of 2020 and the mare’s first stakes win since December.\n\nIt was only just beginning to sink in that perhaps his life as a trainer in Mexico was behind him. The coronavirus changed the trajectory of Gutiérrez’s life, and he hates to consider how different things would be for him today if the “reality” that had shown him that Kukulkan wasn’t good enough to compete at the top level in the U.S. applied to Letruska, too. Or had it applied to Gutiérrez himself.\n\nReflecting on his career at Las Americas, he says, “When you’re leading trainer and you win between 100 and 200 races per year, you’re in a comfort zone, but at the end, I think my cycle there was over because nobody wants to see you there. They want you to go, especially in a country where there’s not much money to go around. It was like that: the giant against everybody else.”\n\nIt was markedly different for Gutiérrez in the States. He’d gone from being a giant in one country to almost unrecognizable in the other. The exploits of Letruska, though, have returned him to “giant” status.\n\nAfter the Added Elegance, the Kentucky-bred daughter of Super Saver whom Larrea had bought in utero for $100,000, went on to win a pair of Gr. 3s: the Shuvee at Belmont in August and the Rampart at Gulfstream in December.\n\nGoing into her five-year-old season this past January, Letruska shipped to Sam Houston for the Gr. 3 Houston Ladies Classic. It was a homecoming of sorts for her trainer, who was disappointed to learn that only the bookkeeper remained from his first time there in the late 1990s. Still, it felt good to be back, especially with a high-caliber horse like Letruska, who won the race.\n\nHer trainer, however, had his eye on a bigger prize.\n\n“When you come from the minor leagues and reach the major league, you want an autograph. I wanted a photo with Monomoy Girl,” he says, speaking of the 2018 champion three-year-old filly and 2020 champion older dirt female trained by Brad Cox.\n\nWith a matchup in the Gr. 1 Apple Blossom Handicap in his sights, Gutiérrez sent Letruska to Oaklawn, where she’d won an allowance optional claimer in April the previous year, to use the Gr. 2 Azeri Stakes as a prep for the Apple Blossom. In the Azeri, Letruska met with her only loss of 2021, finishing second, a head behind last year’s Kentucky Oaks winner Shedaresthedevil, Monomoy Girl’s stablemate.\n\nThen it was on for his Mexican champion to face two reigning Eclipse Award winners, Monomoy Girl and Preakness winner Swiss Skydiver, trained by Kenny McPeek, in the Apple Blossom. Monomoy Girl was favored by the betting public, followed by Swiss Skydiver and Letruska. At the half-mile pole, announcer Vic Stauffer’s race call described the trio, led by Letruska, as “the interloper and two champions” as Gutiérrez’s dream major league matchup unfolded.\n\n“For me, it was perfect,” Gutiérrez says of the stretch run battle, where Monomoy Girl put her head in front of his mare—the “interloper,” despite being a champion herself—and he thought Letruska would be second. “I knew that I was not going to lose absolutely anything. Second was a great result, and when I saw that we were going to get second, few times in my life have I enjoyed so much a race I was losing. When I saw Monomoy Girl winning, I said, ‘It’s okay. It’s a very good result. We’re not coming second or third by 20, and we’re up against the best mares.’ So I sat like this, watching.” He leans back in his chair and stretches his arms out, the posture of a relaxed man savoring his achievement.\n\n“My whole history in Mexico ran through my mind, everything I had done to get there to that race,” he continues. “And that was when the announcer said, ‘And Letruska…!’”\n\nGutiérrez waves his hand dismissively as he recreates the scene. He was fully not expecting to get the win and refused to get his hopes up...second to Monomoy Girl? He’d take it. But Stauffer’s call was right. The margin in the Apple Blossom was a nose, with another 6½ lengths back to Swiss Skydiver in third.\n\n“It was incredible. I had dreamed of winning, but not like this. That race is going to be one of the moments of the year, because both of them ran strong. It wasn’t that Monomoy Girl stopped and Letruska came along and won.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the Apple Blossom, Gutiérrez sensed a change in his mare. “From then on, she understood that she was big. The horse that won the Shuvee, it is not this horse.”\n\nBy the time he arrived at Keeneland in early May with his small stable, Gutiérrez was as recognizable there as he had been at Las Americas, with strangers walking up to talk to him about Letruska. “I just love your mare,” they’d say. Or, “When is she coming out to train?” It’s almost always “la yegua,” “she,” or “her”; very rarely do they use her name, which is superfluous by now.\n\nGutiérrez, a quiet man, doesn’t often say much, but he smiles, nods, and thanks them all.\n\nBefore long, every time she’d come out to train, the bay mare with three white legs, a small star, and a regal bearing was being pointed out and discussed by other trainers, owners, grooms, EMTs, bloodstock agents, and random folks standing on the rail. At first, riders would turn their heads as they jogged past on their mounts to ask her rider, “¿Esa es la yegua?” Is that the mare?\n\nIt’s not just that she’s the best older filly or mare in the country; there’s more to it than that. Backstretches across the country are heavily fueled by a Hispanic workforce, including many from Mexico, so there’s an added element of pride in seeing one of their own, even though she’s not a Mexican-bred, emerge as a championship contender, with the architect and owner two more of their own. Gutiérrez feels that pride, too.\n\nIt’s fair to say that regardless of the future, the Apple Blossom was a defining moment—or perhaps the defining moment—for Gutiérrez. But Letruska has taken him from defining moment to defining moment, and she may not be done yet. With the top race mare in the country in his care, Gutiérrez feels the gravity of his responsibility.\n\n“When you have a horse like this, you can’t make any mistakes. I have to be very careful and give her special care, while knowing at the same time that she’s a horse,” he says. “I can’t do more than I can do, and it can make your head spin. I don’t think about how much she’s worth. I just try to keep her well and get her to the next race.”\n\nLetruska’s campaign has been a fearless one. After the Apple Blossom, she trained at Keeneland and shipped to New York to win the Gr. 1 Ogden Phipps Stakes at Belmont. Brad Cox, the trainer who had defeated Letruska once with Shedaresthedevil, tried to beat her again, but his pair of Bonny South and Shedaresthedevil were second and third in the Phipps. Then, in a move that surprised many, Gutiérrez wheeled Letruska back in the Gr. 2 Fleur de Lis at Churchill, 21 days after the Phipps.\n\nLetruska is a keg of dynamite on four legs. She can detonate one minute and docilely allow a toddler to pet her nose the next. When Gutiérrez noticed that the Phipps hadn’t taken much out of her, he felt it would be better to run than leave her in the stall with no outlet for her explosive energy. In what was essentially a paid workout, she won the Fleur de Lis by 5¾ lengths on his daughter Ana’s 15th birthday.\n\nGutiérrez credits groom José Díaz Jiménez for his bond with Letruska. “José is very important. He has a lot of passion for what he does, and he knows her. This mare is very difficult. And we know each other very well, the three of us. When she feels better, she’s more aggressive. José tells me to be careful because she’s no longer playing, and she’ll get you. She’ll put her ears back, and she’ll turn around and fire. That’s why I don’t put her on Regumate, because she’d get even more aggressive.”\n\nHis target for Letruska after the Fleur de Lis was the Gr. 1 Personal Ensign Stakes at Saratoga. “It’s a Grade 1 race. We can’t leave it. Don’t you agree? Do I sit here and keep fighting her, or not? If you’re number one, you have to defend that and you have to keep winning. You take the risk. You can’t defend it at home. That’s my opinion. After 30 years of doing this, you need to know how to lose. If you know how to lose, one day you’re going to win. And she wants to run. She’s more of a problem for me if she doesn’t run. Like I said about Kukulkan, we’ll lose a Grade 1. I don’t want to lose in a Grade 3.”\n\nYou already know that she won the Personal Ensign, despite pressure on the front end and talented fillies and mares coming at her in waves. Old foes Bonny South and Swiss Skydiver were second and fifth, respectively, split by Chad Brown’s two: Royal Flag and Dunbar Road.\n\nAfter returning to Keeneland, her adopted home track, in September, Letruska trained up to the Gr. 1 Spinster Stakes on Fall Stars Weekend in October with two bullet works. Cox and Brown tried again to beat her, but Letruska was in front at every call, with Dunbar Road and Bonny South again filling the minor places. It was her fourth Breeders’ Cup Challenge automatic berth “Win & You’re In” victory.\n\nOnly one more start, the November 6th Breeders’ Cup Distaff at Del Mar, remains to close out the five-year-old mare’s season. Rogers Beasley, who is now executive vice president and chief strategy officer of Breeders’ Cup Limited, is happy to see his old friend coming in with the favorite for the Distaff, saying, “It’s fantastic. He’s just a genuine, unassuming person. Fausto feels very honored and very blessed to have a wonderful mare like Letruska, and I think he’s doing an excellent job managing her.”\n\nIt’s true; it’s a heckuva campaign Gutiérrez laid out for Letruska, an Eclipse-worthy campaign—not only for his mare, but as the architect behind her every move, potentially for him as well. In seven 2021 starts, Letruska has a record of six wins and one narrow second, all in Graded stakes races, including four Grade 1s, with one more Grade 1 on the schedule. It speaks to Gutiérrez’s appreciation for racing as it should be as well as his confidence in Letruska, who is better than she’s ever been.\n\n“I don’t know how high she can go. She’s more horse than before.”\n\nShe’s won seven of eight races since Gutiérrez removed her blinkers after a fourth-place effort of four runners in last year’s Beldame at Belmont.\n\n“Before, with the blinkers, she ran with the clock, not against the other horses. Now, she sees them.” Is that partially responsible for a big change in her? “Oh, absolutely,” says Gutiérrez. “She has more control of the situation now.”\n\nHis handling of this special but not easy mare is perhaps the biggest reminder that Gutiérrez is already a champion trainer. He’s always watching and reading Letruska, adapting to her changing moods, and he likes to shake up her routine occasionally.\n\n“I try to keep her distracted,” Gutiérrez says.\n\nOne morning, he stopped her rider as they were coming off at the gap. “Take her around one more time,” he told him. “She needs to do more.” Another time, he handed her off to trainer John Ortiz, in whose barn she’d been at Oaklawn, to pony without a rider on the training track at Keeneland.\n\nGutiérrez doesn’t adhere to a strict breeze schedule with Letruska, who comes out of her races looking as though she’s ready to go right back into the starting gate. “Sometimes I think she’s going to come up short on training, but no,” Gutiérrez laughs. “All she needs to do is conserve herself. She doesn’t need to work every six or seven days.”\n\nWhen she does breeze, she goes alone, and she’s gotten the bullet 18 times in 36 works in the U.S., at Saratoga, Keeneland, Oaklawn, Belmont, and Palm Meadows—everywhere she’s ever worked bar Gulfstream, where she had just one breeze before her first start in the country.\n\nZayat Stables eventually came to terms with its creditors, including Fifth Third Bank. It emerged from bankruptcy and rode to glory with American Pharoah, among others. Then, in January 2020, history repeated. MGG Investments filed a lawsuit against Zayat Stables and Zayat family members, alleging the Thoroughbred operation had failed to pay back $23 million of a $30-million loan. Zayat filed a countersuit, alleging he was the victim of a predatory lender acting in bad faith, as he had done in 2015.\n\nAccusations and allegations fly\n\nZayat’s ongoing legal struggles have taken many twists and turns, but I will do my best to summarize. MGG expanded its lawsuit, alleging that Zayat had conspired with family members and others to hide money and distort the value of assets, including horses and breeding rights. MGG also claimed that Zayat had sold assets that were to serve as collateral for its loan. A judge appointed a receiver to take control of Zayat Stables’ finances. Court proceedings again revealed a long list of unpaid bills, and some of Zayat’s many creditors filed legal actions of their own.\n\nIn June 2020, a Kentucky judge ruled that Zayat owed MGG some $24.5 million in loan payments and interest, and dismissed many elements of Zayat’s countersuit. The judge also dismissed MGG’s claims against industry professionals who had done deals with Zayat Stables, but ruled that MGG could move forward with a fraud claim against Zayat. Ahmed Zayat filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2020. Most of his company’s assets, including Thoroughbreds, were auctioned off by the end of the year. This summer, Zayat’s bankruptcy attorney asked to be allowed to withdraw from the proceedings, claiming his client had racked up nearly $370,000 in unpaid legal bills.\n\nZayat Stables’ legal problems also revealed that the operation had run up a total of over $1.5 million in debts to a who’s who of Thoroughbred trainers, including Bob Baffert, Brad Cox, Mike Maker, Richard Baltas, Steve Asmussen, Todd Pletcher and Rudy Rodriquez.\n\nAn ounce of prevention?\n\nAs these events attest, there is no foolproof way to determine whether a client will pay a trainer. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself. Ideally, a trainer and an owner would sign a written contract detailing their arrangement, including the number of horses to be trained, the trainer’s day rate, terms of payment, etc. Written contracts benefit and protect both service providers and their clients, and are accepted as routine in most industries. Horse racing, however, is a notable exception.\n\nAndrew Mollica has worked as racing official, broadcaster and an agent for top jockeys, among other things. In his forties, Mollica returned to college to earn a law degree. Based in New York, he currently practices law, with an emphasis on equine law. Mentioning contracts to Mollica draws a quick response. “I’ve worked in racing for nearly 45 years,” Mollica says, “and I’ve never seen one—not any kind of written agreement between an owner and a trainer. They don’t seem to exist!”\n\nMollica’s not sure what an owner would do if a trainer asked for a written contract, or vice versa. Not that he thinks many would. “American Thoroughbred racing is a 21st-century industry run like an 18th-century enterprise. So much is done on handshake deals. Good or bad, that’s the way it is,” he says.\n\nAs an equine attorney and Thoroughbred owner myself, I know that suggesting you create a simple contract for your services and ask your clients to sign it may cause you to roll your eyes in disbelief. But it is still a good idea. Contracts can be awkward to ask for upfront, but they make all the difference when things go wrong. That is why the phrase “get it in writing” remains a business staple.\n\nIf you do not have a contract, consider sending a follow-up letter or email to your client that outlines your understanding of the terms of your verbal agreement. If the owner thinks you have misunderstood the deal, he or she will likely respond regarding the areas in question. If there are differences, once those differences are resolved, I suggest sending an additional letter or email that documents exactly the agreed upon terms.\n\nThe upfront approach\n\nOf course, you should always keep accurate records of your working hours and expenses. You should also consider requesting to be paid upfront. In the event you are training horses on a monthly payment schedule, request payment. If payment problems arise, you will know from the get-go. If you are not comfortable requesting the full amount in advance, consider requesting expenses for care and feeding. That can go a long way towards a solid cash flow.\n\nIf you are concerned about entering a business relationship with an individual, you may conduct an online background check. Many reliable companies provide this service at a reasonable price, including Intelius, TruthFinder, BeenVerified, and others. A standard “people search” will typically review public records from the last seven years, should report any bankruptcies or criminal convictions, and does not require you to obtain permission of the person in question under current U.S. law.\n\nYou may also consider conducting a credit check online. But be aware that credit checks are governed by strict federal regulations, as well as applicable state laws. In the United States, you must obtain written permission from the individual whose credit report you are requesting, among other requirements. You cannot legally conduct a “secret” credit check.\n\nRemedies for unpaid bills\n\nIn the event the client/owner refuses to pay, what are your options? When this happens, act sooner rather than later, and document your communications with the client regarding the matter. Keep a written phone log listing calls and texts, save all emails, and keep copies of anything sent by mail. Once you have made a reasonable effort to get paid, contact an attorney, preferably one with equine experience.\n\nEvery case is different, but here are some likely scenarios. Your attorney will contact the client, requesting the debt be paid to avoid legal proceedings. This alone may result in payment. Or it may result in acknowledgment of the monies owed and a negotiated payment schedule. If you are in possession of the horse (or horses), you will have to continue caring for and feeding the animal(s). Though this will increase the amount of expenses you are owed, you cannot simply neglect the horse. However, whether or not you continue to train the horse is your decision, and I suggest you make that decision with the help of your attorney.\n\nLawyers, liens and money\n\nIf the owner refuses to make a good-faith effort to resolve the matter, and the horse is in your possession, your attorney will likely file for a lien. This powerful legal tool allows you to retain the horse as collateral until the debt is paid and retain or sell the horse if it is not. The specific term for this type of lien varies from state to state. It is commonly known as an agister’s lien, a stableman’s lien or a liveryman’s lien. The rules and regulations governing these liens vary by state, and it is important that you work with an experienced attorney when attempting to attain such a lien.\n\nObtaining an agister’s lien is a multi-step process. “If the horse is in your possession, and it’s worth more than the debt, you will get paid,” Andrew Mollica says. “But you have to follow the process.”\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War hero James Lawrence shouted, “Don’t give up the ship!” when the British attempted to board his vessel. “Don’t give up the horse!” is Andrew Mollica’s remarkably similar battle cry for trainers dealing with unpaid bills. Good advice, because in most states, if you return the animal to the owner or turn it over to officials, you may surrender your right to obtain or enforce an agister’s lien. If you are pressured to return the animal by anyone, inform them that you are in the process of obtaining a legal lien and have the right to retain the animal until the lien is issued.\n\nMany owners pay up when they learn of lien or possible auction. “They suddenly realize you’re serious and act accordingly,” Mollica notes. What if they still refuse to pay? If you auction the horse, in most states, you are entitled to what you are owed, plus legal expenses, including the cost of obtaining the lien, as well as the auction costs incurred. If the horse sells for more than what you are owed plus expenses, you are not entitled to keep the difference. You must send that money to the owner who hired you—no matter how much you resent them. If the horse sells for less than you are owed, you may pursue the remaining debt in court.\n\nWere you in favor of the Horse Racing Integrity and Safety Act (HISA)?\n\nWhen I started out, when I first learned of it, I wasn’t in favor of federal involvement in our game for any number of reasons. The more I learned and the more I got into it, I realized that for decades now, there have been a strong group of people who benefit from the ill-conceived and a patchwork of different regulations in the 38 states that are running racing in the United States. I looked and saw the same people say “Trust us, give us a little more time, I’ve got this. I’m the smartest person in the world. All you have to do is ask me.” I realized that in so many years, back in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, they’re saying the same thing they’re saying now.\n\nI started to see more smoke and mirrors. It just hit me one day that we need a new system. It was probably around the time the Jockey Club took up the pursuit of federal legislation. It started with Arthur and Stacy Hancock saying we’re dealing with the Wild West when it comes to medication. You basically just stand there. I am not unique. There are a lot of people for a lot of years who are all in, putting everything they have into the racing business. We’re so far in; we’re not going to do anything else.\n\nThere had to be a better way.\n\nThat view came from my association with the horsemen groups. There are people who weren’t elected, who were making a lot of money and had not or were not involved in owning or breeding horses, and really had commandeered the voice of people who had true skin in the game.\n\nAs I went along, it became more and more clear to me that the progress was only going to happen if that message became accepted by a wider faction. I have a national organization (West Point). Our business would be on a better road with a national authority to address the integrity and the safety side of things.\n\nVery few of the trainers that I’ve talked to were totally against it.\n\nHow bad has it been with different rules, involving, medication, use of the whip, rules for disqualifications?\n\nLet me say this. The other thing that gave me confidence in HISA was I learned about the United States Anti-doping Agency (USADA). Just to have a federal law passed to create a new authority from scratch would be uber, uber concerning. Then you realize we’re not the first industry or sport to have undergone this process. One, in particular, was cycling. There are parallels there. The USADA has a model that’s tried and been tested. That’s what allayed the fears that I had initially with the federal government coming in. It’s not the federal government—it’s federal oversight. Cycling, martial arts, the Olympics—we’re not the only ones who had this done. They’re not creating the structure from scratch. They have learned from the other programs, especially cycling.\n\nThere is a level of independence we haven’t had before. It’s like we hit a Triple Crown. We got the law passed—that was the Derby. The Preakness was putting in the structure and the rules of the authority. The Belmont will be the execution and the refinement, putting it out and hitting the go button.\n\nCan the Horse Racing Integrity and Safety Act improve public perception?\n\nIt will improve. Undoubtedly. I think people—and we talk to a lot of people who want to get in the game just in the past two months—are very clear that our industry wants to change, and we’ve taken action to change our sport. I would hope that I’m not the only one who’s seen a benefit from people knowing the jig is up with the people who blatantly cheat in our industry. When they see you’re trying and you’re taking bold, definitive steps, they’ll give you the benefit of doubt. They don’t want to hear people saying the same thing for decades, and it hasn’t worked. They know it. Sophisticated investors—the people we want to attract as owners and breeders—know it. Those types of things that would be good to promote: wealthy people who have been successful in their business. They know. People knew we weren’t authentic before. That changed very quickly with HISA.\n\nWhat was the impact of having high-profile trainers who have had medication violations in our biggest races?\n\nAs an owner, I get sick to my stomach thinking of how long “those guys” on the backside have been peddling their latest “hop.” I simply can’t fathom how tough it’s been to have trained horses the right way over many years and know that races and money have been stolen from us.\n\nAre you optimistic about racing’s future?\n\nYes, I’m very bullish on racing’s future. We all love the industry. It’s our time. Most states have stated publicly that they want to cooperate and want to participate. That’s a good sign. I know it’s not going to be easy. Some aren’t on board, but the train is rolling. Work is being done on this.\n\nThere are people who aren't in favor of this. Once it passed, they rallied behind it. That’s a good thing. It’s very gratifying to see the depth and the breadth of the support of this. Hopefully, that support is authentic. It’s just not words, but it’s deeds to support this. It’s easier to say you support it, but we need it to be true and authentic. I look at the HBPA. I don’t understand their position. They haven’t supported the initiative. If you can get through the criticism, ask them what their plan is. How would they attack the integrity problem in racing? I haven’t seen anything that could be called a program. It’s important for you to say not what you’re against, but what you’re for. I’m a member of the HPBA in many states. I’m disappointed with how they dealt with this.\n\nRon was as enthralled as she was about Saratoga. “They’re stopping traffic for horses to cross Union Avenue,” he said. “Wherever you go, you can have a Daily Racing Form with you and not have people think you’re a degenerate. It was like Wrigley Field; but instead of the Cubs, you had the New York Yankees.”\n\nBesides racing Thoroughbreds, Ron and Ricki are involved in vintage car road racing. “We go to different tracks around the country,” Ron said. “We also had a small sponsorship in a car that won a 24-hour endurance race in Daytona.”\n\nRon was enticed into Thoroughbred racing by Jane Schwartz’s book Ruffian: Burning From the Start. Ron said, ”I’m a sports guy. I was intrigued by her story. I was amazed that there was a horse who was never headed. Then the match race with Foolish Pleasure... Even when she broke down, she was in the lead. My interest kind of snowballed from there.”\n\nHe felt enough—with an assist from multiple Eclipse Award Photographer Barb Livingston—to visit Ruffian’s grave at Belmont Park near a flagpole in the infield with her nose pointed toward the finish line. “[Ricki and I] left a bouquet of flowers,” he said. “We’re just fans—new fans. Even though I’m just a fan, I’m choked up.” He’s got a lot of company, even after all these years.\n\nThe Rashinskis couldn’t do anything to help Ruffian, but they sure are helping other horses now, through their support of Anna Ford’s New Vocations program, converting retired Thoroughbreds to a second career. “I love the animals,” Ron said. “We’re very involved. They do a great job, New Vocations.”\n\nRon decided to get involved in Thoroughbred ownership after meeting a gentleman from Wisconsin—Gary Leverton, who has since passed away. “We started talking, and we wound up partnering up on a horse at an auction at Hawthorne,” Ron said. “My wife and I were totally oblivious to Thoroughbreds.”\n\nInitially, the Rashinskis used Chicago-based Hugh Robertson as their trainer, racing as Homewrecker Stable. Ron got the name when someone suggested that investing in vintage cars can become a homewrecker.\n\nWhen the Rashinskis decided they wanted to race in New York and Kentucky, they hired Eddie Kenneally to train. “We trusted those two men implicitly with our animals,” Ricki said. “We’ve been with Eddie for 25 years.”\n\nRon said, “We don’t have a lot of high-priced yearlings. We don’t buy very expensive horses.” Yet they’ve won repeatedly at racing’s highest level, thanks to the skills of Kenneally—a very under-publicized top trainer.\n\nTheir first outstanding horse was the filly Bushfire. After finishing third in her 2005 debut at Churchill Downs, she won six of her next eight starts including the Florida Oaks, the Gr. 1 Ashland, the Gr. 1 Acorn and the Gr. 1 Mother Goose. One of her misses was a solid third in the Gr. 1 Kentucky Oaks. Her only finish out of the money in her first nine starts was a seventh on a sloppy track in the Gr. 2 Davona Dale. Her earnings topped $800,000.\n\nIn partnership, they had another star in Custom for Carlos, who had six victories, four seconds and one third in 15 starts, taking three Gr. 3 stakes, the 2009 Jersey Shore, the Mr. Prospector and the Count Fleet Handicap, and making almost half a million dollars.\n\nAgain in a different partnership, their gray Sailor’s Valentine captured the Gr. 1 Ashland in 2017 on the way to making more than $400,000 in 13 starts.\n\nBy the time Point Me By made the races in 2020, Ron had learned, somewhat, to control his emotions when his horses raced. “To tell you the truth, I have trouble handling horse racing,” he said. “I was Mr. Pepto Bismol. I’d be pounding that stuff down. If the horse didn’t win, I felt I let people down. Now I know people are just happy for the experience. They don’t care. I’m a little better now.” Winning a bunch of stakes helped.\n\nTheir three-year-old colt Point Me By, (a son on Point of Entry) was a $30,000 purchase at Keeneland and didn't have anything near those credentials when he stepped into the starting gate for the Bruce D. Stakes, having followed a maiden victory with a fourth in an allowance race. He won the Mr. D by 2 ¾ lengths under Luis Saez, who took off a day from his dominant meeting as Saratoga’s leading rider, to pilot Point Me Buy in the Bruce D. and Zulu Alpha, who finished seventh in the renamed Arlington Million, the Mr. D.\n\nThe Rashinskis would love to bring Point Me By back to Arlington next year. But Arlington Park closed forever in late September. “It would have been nice to come back and try to win the Million if he was good enough for it,” Ron said. “Too bad.” He’s got a lot of company, too, after all these years of elegant racing at Arlington Park.\n\nGeorge Hall\n\nMax Player\n\nIn early 2019, George co-founded Sports BLX, which allows low-cost ownership interest in Thoroughbreds and in other sports and athletes. He co-founded Sports BLX with Joseph De Perio. “The concept was to see if we could create a market where people that might want to buy a small share of a horse or a company that owns a horse could feel the experience following a horse like an owner does,” George said. “It seemed a worthwhile endeavor. It now includes deals with athletes, professional sports teams and racecars. It’s a very broad company.”\n\nBorn the son of a New York City cop in Queens, George, now 61, got a bachelor’s degree from the Merchant Marine Academy and an MBA from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He became the founder, president and majority shareholder of Clinton Group Inc., a Manhattan-based investment company which opened in 1991. Its success allowed George to invest in Thoroughbreds.\n\nA trip with a friend to Monmouth Park in 2005 was the catalyst. “I was introduced to Kelly Breen in the stands,” George said. “Kelly was the leading trainer at Monmouth. He is extremely enthusiastic, and he invited me to see his barn just to show us his horses. I had my two-year-old daughter with me, Kathryn. He gave her carrots to feed the horses. I said, `This is a very nice man.’ He’s so enthusiastic. We talked about getting into it. We decided to go to the Keeneland Sales.”\n\nThey spent $118,000 to buy four horses and could not have done much better. George named his first horse for his daughter, Keeneland Kat, and she won her first start, a maiden race, by 6 ¾ lengths. She stepped up to the $100,000 Sorority Stakes and won again by 2 ½ lengths. That earned her a start in the Gr. 1 Frizette and she finished a non-threatening third. “Being third in a Gr. 1 with your first horse was pretty special,” George said. “Then she started having minor issues.”\n\nUnfortunately, the issues ended her racing career. “She was just a great horse,” George said. “Kelly did a great job with her. She became a broodmare. We bred her for five, six years and sold her.”\n\nAnother member of George’s initial yearling foursome was named Fagan’s Legacy to honor his grandfather, Larry Fagan. Fagan’s Legacy finished second in his debut, then won a maiden race by five lengths and the $82,000 Pilgrim Stakes by 3 ¼ lengths.\n\nGeorge admitted that his immediate success got him a tad over-confident: “Oh, yeah, we thought it was easy.”\n\nIt isn’t. Fagan’s Legacy didn’t hit the board in five subsequent starts and never raced again.\n\nRuler On Ice and Pants On Fire, who made their debuts 13 days apart in September 2010, took George on a great ride. Pants On Fire, who was second in a maiden race at Philadelphia Park to begin his career, won the 2011 Gr. 2 Louisiana Derby by a neck, earning a spot in the Kentucky Derby. He finished ninth to Animal Kingdom. Pants On Fire won the Gr. 3 Pegasus at Monmouth Park and finished fifth in the Gr. 1 Haskell. Later on, he won the Gr. 2 Monmouth Cup and the Gr. 3 Ack Ack back-to-back, finishing his career with 11 victories from 41 starts and earnings of more than $1.6 million.\n\nRuler On Ice, a Keeneland yearling whom George said was a “little wild when he was young,” was gelded. He finished fifth in his debut at Monmouth. The following spring, he finished third in the Gr. 3 Sunland Park Derby. He was the first also-eligible for the 2011 Kentucky Derby but didn’t get into the race. Instead, he finished second in the Federico Tesio Stakes at Pimlico.\n\nThat was good enough to convince Kelly to take a shot with Ruler On Ice in the Belmont Derby. Sent off at 24-1, Ruler On Ice won by three-quarters of a length under Jose Valdivia, Jr. “It was unbelievable,” George said. “That was pretty spectacular.”\n\nRuler On Ice then ran third in the Gr. 1 Haskell and fourth in the Gr. 1 Travers. His only other victory came in an allowance race, yet he wound up with more than $1.7 million in earnings off four victories, five seconds and three thirds in 23 starts.\n\nOff the track, George has shared his business and equine success with others. He was the recipient of the New York University’s prestigious Sir Harold Acton Medal in recognition of his philanthropy. One of his charitable acts was establishing the George E. Hall Childhood Diabetes Foundation at Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\nGeorge’s three children enjoy horses, too. That two-year-old visit to the Monmouth Park backstretch helped shape his now 19-year-old daughter Kathryn’s life. While attending New York University, she maintains her appreciation of horses. “Her life’s passion is show jumping,” George said. “She loves horses. She has two jumpers and travels around.”\n\nGeorge Jr., 18, likes going to the track with his dad but is more attached to fish than horses. “His passion is fishing and cooking,” George said. “While he takes a gap year after graduating from high school, he’s working at a restaurant. He catches them in the morning, brings them in and filets them.”\n\nTheir 12-year-old sister Charlotte, rides ponies and also enjoys going to the track.\n\nThe Hall clan may have their best racetrack moments ahead of them, thanks to the emergence of their four-year-old colt Max Player—a home-bred who was born on their 385-acre Annestes Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, and is trained by Steve Asmussen.\n\nHISA Particulars\n\nHISA creates the “Authority,” which is an independent, nonprofit corporation, created and authorized by Congress to establish and enforce medication, anti-doping and racetrack safety rules and programs for the United States Thoroughbred racing industry. In other words, HISA has been lawfully entrusted to take on its rulemaking and enforcement activities.\n\nMembers of the Authority’s board and both the Anti-Doping & Medication Control and the Racetrack Safety standing committees are robustly putting their knowledge and expertise to pen the rules, regulations and protocols that will complete the details needed to enforce the act.\n\nThe Authority is tasked with implementing and enforcing a horse racing anti-doping and medication control program as well as a racetrack safety program for Thoroughbred racing. Even though the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will have oversight over the Authority, the Authority will exercise absolute and independent national command over anti-doping and medication control and racetrack safety matters for all Thoroughbred racing and training in the United States.\n\nHISA will be guided by a board of directors consisting of nine members, five of which are from outside the Thoroughbred racing industry and four from within the industry. Boththe Anti-Doping and Medication Control Standing Committee and the Racetrack Safety Standing Committee consist of four independent members and three industry members.\n\n“They picked a lot of people [for the board] that have a great record, and their hearts are in the right place,” Irwin said. “At this point, we just have to trust these people to do the right thing. The whole point of the [legislation] is that we wanted an independent organization to be in charge.”\n\n(See sidebars for selected members.)\n\nThe Authority is structured to ensure that individuals outside the Thoroughbred industry are in the majority when considering key issues. However, it does survey significant industry input from the industry directors as well as members on advisory committees. There are also supermajority requirements for any material changes to the Authority’s rules as well as the oversight by the FTC.\n\nThe FTC will oversee the Authority in approving its rules and handling appeals in violation matters.\n\nMedication minutiae\n\nMedication baseline rules are established in the legislation, and the Authority is able to establish other rules, if approved by the FTC. To modify medication rules in a manner that would make them less stringent, HISA requires them to be approved by both the board and the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The USADA is described by HISA as the Authority’s medication control enforcement agency.\n\nPer HISA, anti-doping and medication control program operations will be managed by USADA. They will conduct and oversee anti-doping and medication control testing and results management, independent investigations, charging and adjudication of potential violations and enforcement of civil sanctions for those violations.\n\nDr. Jeff Blea is the equine medical director (EMD) at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. As EMD, he is the liaison between the university and the California Horse Racing Board (CHRB).\n\n“A lot of what I do is CHRB related,” Blea explained, “...handling complaints, overseeing investigators, making recommendations to the stewards, etc.” “Technically it is an advisory role, not the heavy hand that people think it is.\n\nBlea is also on the HISA Anti-Doping and Medication Control Standing Committee.\n\n“A lot of horsemen have hoped for a long time for uniformity and structure to provide a level playing field,” he said. “What’s interesting is that, in California, I think we are the strictest across the country. I think we are far above as far as welfare and safety. We are hoping that what we’ve gone through and the changes we’ve made will be similar to what we will see under HISA.”\n\n“A lot of work is currently being done by the committees,” Blea added. “It is a work in progress and not ready for primetime yet.”\n\nThe racetrack safety standing committee will develop proposed safety expectations. They are to take into consideration existing safety standards, including those of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Safety and Integrity Alliance Code of Standards, the International Federation of Horseracing Authority’s International Agreement on Breeding, Racing and Wagering and the British Horseracing Authority’s Equine Health and Welfare program.\n\nProposed safety standards will be presented to the Authority’s board to review and approve. If accepted, the final stamp of approval will come from the FTC.\n\nThe idiom ‘no guts, no glory’, when taken in the literal sense, is quite an appropriate thought for the racehorse. The equine gut is a collection of organs, which when in a state of disease, causes a multitude of problems; and when functioning effectively, it is key for conversion of food to fuel and maintaining normal health.\n\nIn the same way we consider how fuel-efficient our car engines are, what power can be delivered and the influence of fuel quality on function, we can consider the horses’ digestive anatomy. The state of the ‘engine’ in the horse is critical to the output. What is fed or supplemented, and the manner in which we do so, has fascinating and somewhat frightening effects on efficiency and recovery.\n\nWe now, in a human context, have a much better understanding of the relationship between the gut and states of disease. Before disease in a notable sense is present, we see loss of function and reduction in performance. With equines, in recent years, the focus has fallen toward ulceration and the stomach. Now interest is growing into the small and large intestines, looking at factors that influence their performance and in turn how this affects performance on the track.\n\nIn order to consider how we can positively influence gut function, first we need to understand its design and capability, or lack of capability which is more often the problem. The horse, by definition, falls into the category of a large non ruminant herbivore—the same grouping as rhinoceroses, gorillas and elephants. The horse is well designed for a fibre-based diet, as reflected by the capacity of the large intestines, yet we must rely heavily on the small intestine when feeding racehorses. Health and function of both small and large intestines are important and are connected.\n\nSmall Intestine\n\nThe small intestine is a relatively short tube of approximately 25m in length—the same length as found in sheep or goats. The primary role of the small intestine is the digestion of protein, fats and carbohydrates. The workload of this organ is significant and is also time constrained, with feed typically moving at a rate of 30cm per minute (1). The rate of passage is highly influenced by whether the stomach was empty before feeding, or if forage has recently been consumed. The advice of feeding chaff with hard feed is in part to the slow rate of passage and give further time for the processes of digestion.\n\nThe mechanisms for digestion in the small intestine include pancreatic juices, bile and enzymes. Of particular interest are the various enzymes responsible for digestion of protein and carbohydrates— the key nutrients often considered when choosing a racing diet. The ability to digest carbohydrate, namely starch, is dependent on two factors: firstly, form of starch and the level of alpha-amylase—a starch-digesting enzyme found in the small intestine. Whilst the horse is quite effective in digestion of protein, there are distinct limitations around digestion of starch.\n\nStarch digestion, or lack of digestion in the small intestine, is the area of interest. When feeding, the aim is to achieve maximum conversion of starch in the small intestine to simple sugars for absorption. This is beneficial in terms of providing a substrate readily available for use as an energy source and reducing the ill effects seen when undigested starch moves into the next section of the digestive tract. Alpha-amylase is found in very limited supply in the equine small intestine—the amount present being only approximately 5% of that found within a pig. Despite a low content, the horse can effectively digest certain cereal starches, namely oats, quite effectively without processing. However, other grains commonly used, (e.g., barley and maize [corn]), have poor digestibility unless processed. Flaked, pelleted or extruded cereals undergo a change in starch structure enabling the enzyme to operate more effectively.\n\nProcessing grains whilst improving digestion does not alter the amount of enzyme present in the individual. An upper limit exists on starch intake, after which the system is simply overloaded and the workload is beyond the capacity of the naturally present enzymes. The level is estimated at 2g starch per kilogram of bodyweight in each meal fed. In practice, this translates to 3.5kg (7 ¾ lbs) of a traditional grain-based diet of 28% starch. In bowls, this is roughly 2 bowls of cubes or 2 ¼ bowls of mix—an intake typical of an evening feed. The ‘safe limit’ as a concept is questionable because of other factors involved in starch digestion, including how quickly a horse will eat their feed, dental issues and individual variation in the level of alpha-amylase present.\n\nIn practice, feeding racehorses will invariably test the capacity of the small intestine as the volume of feed required to meet the demands of training is significant, and through time constraints of both horse and human results in a large-sized evening meal. The addition of amylase or other enzymes to the diet is therefore of interest. Addition of amylase is documented to increase digestion of maize (corn)—one of the most difficult grains to digest—from 47.3% to 57.5% in equines (2). Equally, wheat digestion has been evidenced to improve with a combination of beta-glucanase, alpha-amylase and xylanase in equines, increasing starch digestion from 95.1% to 99.3% (3).\n\nUse of enzymes in the diet has two areas of benefit: increasing starch conversion and energy availability, and reducing the amount of undigested starch that reaches the hindgut. The efficacy of the small intestine directly impacts the health of the large intestine—both of which influence performance."
