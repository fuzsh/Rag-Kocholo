        "text": "Alan Porter\n\nThe talented and versatile Flameaway was a stakes winner from 5½ to 8½ furlongs on dirt and turf, and at two, three and four years. Among his five stakes triumphs is a victory over Champion Vino Rosso and multiple grade one winner Catholic Boy in the Sam F. Davis Stakes (G3). Flameaway is by multiple Champion Sire Scat Daddy, from a European Classic family.\n\nScat Daddy sired undefeated Triple Crown winner Justify out of a mare by Ghostzapper, a son of Awesome Again, from the Deputy Minister branch of Northern Dancer. It would also be possible to bring in Awesome Again though Daaher, Toccet and Awesome of Course. There is also a Scat Daddy grade one winner out of a mare by Deputy Minister himself, and graded stakes winners out of mares by French Deputy and Silver Deputy (sire of Posse, Badge of Silver and Spring At Last), this also includes daughters of Touch Gold, Deputy Commander, Salt Lake and Forest Camp.\n\nThe cross of Scat Daddy and sons over Danzig line mares has been a prolific one with more than 20 stakes winners, including grade one winners out of mares by Hard Spun and Boundary (sire of Big Brown), Oasis Dream (by Green Desert) and Exceed and Excel (by Danehill, whose sons Fastnet Rock, Rock of Gibraltar, Danehill Dancer and Oratorio are broodmare sires of Scat Daddy line stakes winners) as well as graded winners out of mares). There are also graded stakes winners out of mares by Belong to Me and War Chant, and a stakes winner out of a mare by Langfuhr. Mares by War Front and Exchange Rate could also work.\n\nThe cross of Scat Daddy and sons with Sadler’s Wells line mares has been a very successful one, including a grade one winner out of a mare by Powerscourt and a grade one winner out of a mare by Borrego (by El Prado, sire of Medaglia d’Oro, Kitten’s Joy and Artie Schiller), as well as three stakes winners out of mares by Galileo (represented in the U.S. by Magician and Cape Blanco).\n\nTurning to the Mr. Prospector line, Scat Daddy has enjoyed considerable success with mares from the Fappiano branch. He has graded winners out of mares by Unbridled’s Song and Empire Maker and stakes winners out of mares by Broken Vow and Niigon, all by Unbridled. From mares by Unbridled’s Song, there is a grade one winner out of a mare by Buddha, and graded winners from Rockport Harbor, First Defence and Songandaprayer. This also suggests trying daughters of sires such as Midshipman, Even the Score, Half Ours and Old Fashioned. Empire Maker is the sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister. There are also Scat Daddy stakes winners out of mares by Fappiano sons Rubiano (sire of Too Much Bling) and A.P. Jet, and mares by Quiet American and his grandson, Midnight Lute, could also be considered.\n\nThe cross of Scat Daddy and mares from the Gone West line has also proved fruitful. There is a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Gone West himself. The cross with mares by Seeker’s Reward has produced five grade one winners, including U.S. star, Dacita. There are also grade one winners out of daughters of Proud Citizen and Elusive Quality (sire of Quality Road), and a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Grand Slam, as well as a stakes winner out of a mare by that horse’s son, Strong Hope. It would also be possible to try mares by Mr. Greeley, and by Speightstown and his son, Munnings.\n\nThe Forty Niner branch of Mr. Prospector has produced a graded stakes winner out of a mare by End Sweep (sire of Trippi) and stakes winners out of mares by Coronado’s Quest, Jules (sire of Peace Rules) and Editor’s Note. We can also find Forty Niner through Distorted Humor (and sons such as Any Given Saturday, Cowtown Cat, Drosselmeyer, Flower Alley, Jimmy Creed and Sharp Humor)–which would combined the related Distorted Humor and Fusai, Banker’s Gold, Gold Fever, Roar and Tactical Advantage (broodmare sire of a Candy Ride line grade one winner).\n\nScat Daddy has a pair of grade one winners out of a mare by Street Cry (sire of Street Sense). There is a grade two winner out of a mare by Smart Strike, two graded stakes winners out of a mare by his son English Channel, and another out of a mare by his son Curlin, which suggests mares by Lookin At Lucky. From other branches of the Mr. Prospector line, there are Scat Daddy line graded stakes winners out of mares by Afleet (sire of Northern Afleet and grandsire of Afleet Alex), Not For Love and Thunder Gulch (and a stakes winner out of a mare by his son Point Given). There are also stakes winners out of mares by Smoke Glacken, Seeking the Gold (sire of Mutakddim, Petionville and Cape Town) and Lemon Drop Kid.\n\nConsidering the A.P. Indy line, the cross with the mares from the Pulpit branch–which gives the influential sisters Yarn and Preach–has delivered four stakes winners, three out of mares by Tapit (sire of Trappe Shot, Tapizar and Constitution) and one out of a mare by Sky Mesa. Graded stakes winner Azar is by Scat Daddy out of a mare by Mineshaft (bred on the same cross as Pulpit, and himself sire of Discreetly Mine and Dialed In) and there is also a stakes winner out of a mare by Bernardini (sire of Stay Thirsty and To Honor and Serve). This also suggests mares by Flatter, Congrats, Malibu Moon, Stephen Got Even, Jump Start and Majestic Warrior.\n\nThere are five stakes winners, four graded, by Scat Daddy out of Halo line mares, including graded stakes winners out of mares by Saint Ballado sons Sunriver and Saint Liam, and a graded winner from daughters of Sunny’s Halo and Lively One. There is also a stakes winner out of a mare by More Than Ready (sire of Ready’s Image, Verrazano and Daredevil). Halo is a Hail to Reason line horse, and Scat Daddy also has two stakes winners out of mares by Dynaformer (sire of Temple City, Point of Entry and Purim) who is from the Roberto branch of that line.\n\nScat Daddy has done well with Blushing Groom line mares, with grade one winners out of mares by Blushing John and Fantastic Light, a graded winner by Rahy, and a stakes winner by Kafwain, a son of Cherokee Run."
