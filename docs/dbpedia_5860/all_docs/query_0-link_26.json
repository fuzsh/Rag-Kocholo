        "meta_description": "Halo, great grand sire (February 7, 1969 â€“ November 28, 2000). An American Thoroughbred racehorse and an important Champion sire. After having little success at age two racing on dirt tracks, in his three-year-old campaign his U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer MacKenzie Miller switched him to racing on turf, where he achieved better results. Although never a superstar horse, Halo raced for four years and in 1974, at age five, won the Grade I United Nations Handicap.",
