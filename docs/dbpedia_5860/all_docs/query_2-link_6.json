        "text": "The following treatise is the product of Dr. Rif’at Hussain, breeder of Thoroughbreds for several decades. His most acclaimed homebred was the exceptionally fast racer Shimatoree, whom he bred and raced in partnership with trainer Dick Dutrow (the elder). Dr. Hussain’s views on bloodlines and bloodstock are, therefore, of interest, and the Doc is one who always has a firm opinion on a mating.\n\nInbreeding\n\nInbreeding and its advantages and disadvantages in racehorses may produce certain desirable characteristics such as speed, stamina, soundness, constitution, character, etc.\n\nWhat one reads today in the trade journals is notable either for a lack of accurate information or an incomplete account of the practice of inbreeding. The analysis usually provides a very limited and overly simplistic view of inbreeding and what it can do for the breeder in fulfilling his aim of producing smashing racehorses.\n\nThere is, however, one fundamental fact that must be kept in mind – that inbreeding is the only tool that we can use to manipulate the genetic puzzle to obtain substantial improvement in the racing ability of the modern Thoroughbred provided it is done in a carefully planned and deliberately well thought out manner.\n\nThe Thoroughbred is intensely inbred and has been closely inbred from time to time during the last 300 years. Before the start of the Thoroughbred era in England, and before the stud records were kept in England, the local English horses were very closely inbred because of geography and transportation conditions as they prevailed at the time in the British Isles. Even more inbred were the imported oriental horses at the time (Arab and Barb), where it is quite well-known that the Arabs did, in fact, practice incestuous matings of their favorite horses quite frequently, in addition to the inbreeding resulting from their geographic isolation in the desert.\n\nCharles Darwin points out in ref: to inbreeding and its effects:\n\nClose inbreeding causes loss of vigor, fertility and loss of size, etc.\n\nThe negative effects of inbreeding do not become evident immediately, but the positive effects do.\n\nThe great advantage of inbreeding in order to maintain and enhance desirable characteristics is well established and thus far outweighs the deleterious effects.\n\nLet us examine these dictums in reference to the Thoroughbred racehorse.\n\nFirstly:\n\nThe question is loss of size.\n\nIn the case of the Thoroughbred, this has not occurred. This is due to the selection of the breeding stock that has gone on for the last 300 or so years. Classic winners today are bigger than those of 200 years ago. This is confirmed by the written records kept of measurements and the horse shoes that are still available in the museums in England.\n\nThe question is loss of vigor.\n\nThis has occurred only in those strains that were not vigorous to start with. In other words, if the breeding stock selected was not very vigorous and those ancestors being inbred to also were not very vigorous, then the inbred foals will not be very vigorous.\n\nSo if you were inbreeding to vigorous strains only (Nasrullah, St. Simon, Northern Dancer, etc) through breeding stock with a great deal of vigor, there will be no loss of vigor. Loss of vigor does not occur because of inbreeding in this case as vigor has become enhanced due to the inbreeding.\n\nThe question is loss of fertility\n\nCaused by close inbreeding is not borne out by the facts. The fertility of the English mares was complained about in those times and after the importation of the oriental stallions – some improvement did occur in fertility in the short term. But this positive effect on fertility turned out to be quite transient. The fertility averages returned to what they were before the importation of oriental horses. Later on, the same was the case in regards to the Thoroughbred stallions and mares up to the modern era. The records of imported Thoroughbred stallions indicate that the number of barren mares has not been that significantly different from the stallions – (and mares) – that never left. So the supposed deleterious effects of in-breeding on fertility are simply not true when one looks and analyses the record.\n\nSecondly:\n\nDo the results of inbreeding appear sooner when they are positive? Sometimes they do and sometimes they do not. They physical and structural results of in-breeding become apparent if the foal inherits the racing ability – (functional) – of the ancestor to whom he or she is inbred. The commonly held fears of having foals with congenital abnormalities or weakness simply because of inbreeding are not true at all, provided you have selected the breeding stock (stallions and mares) carefully. If the two parents are strong and robust with good constitutions and are known to produce healthy foals, their inbred foals will also be strong and robust with great vitality. Most of those that condemn inbreeding today and blame it for everything from unsoundness to bleeding and wind infirmities are outside professors whose horsemanship is limited to breeding mice in the experimental labs. The critics of inbreeding in the Thoroughbred use the unrelated examples of inbreeding of mice, rabbits, monkeys, cattle and sheep to scare everyone. They hide behind their “pseudo-scientific status” and use the word “genetics” to legitimize their opinions.\n\nInbreeding has to be used just like any other breeding formula where the breeding stock – (or source animals) – must be based on very strict guidelines of conformation, pedigree, temperament, constitution, and character. The negative effects of inbreeding become evident only if inbreeding is used without care and without judicious selection of breeding stock. The key words toward success are proper selection of breeding stock.\n\nThirdly: the beneficial effects\n\nThe benefits of inbreeding far outweigh any possible deleterious effects. Most of the undesirable effects can be eliminated by careful selection of the breeding stock. If you wish to breed sound animals, you must have a sound mare that comes from a sound family and is by a sound broodmare sire. She then should be mated to a sound stallion who is from a sound sire line. In addition, the stallion or the mare to whom you are inbreeding to also must have been a sound animal and produced sound animals in their produce. And you can substitute speed or stamina, etc.\n\nLet us examine a few hypothetical situations.\n\nOne can inbreed to Secretariat or to Northern Dancer today. Let us look at this from an analytical standpoint. Merely placing the name of Northern Dancer three times in a pedigree in a 3x3x4 position will not re-create the characteristics of Northern Dancer, or Secretariat in a similar situation. The written names in a pedigree are only an indication of the existing names on the page and no more.\n\nThe scientific basis for obtaining ANY BENEFIT from inbreeding is that the desired characteristics must be present in the stallion’s and mare’s germ cells (ovum and sperm), but then they must also be present in the resulting zygote which forms the new animal. Anyone involved in breeding thoroughbreds knows that there are billions of sperms in each ejaculate of the stallion, and there are at least thousands of ova in the mare’s ovaries. It is also well known that perhaps most, if not all, of these germ cells carry genetic codes for different and differing characteristics. That is why full brothers and full sisters seldom have the same qualities or similar abilities. Thus, repeating inbreeding on the same basis, for example: 2×4 to Bold Ruler, will not result in the same Thoroughbred with the same racing ability, even if repeated many times.\n\nSo inbreeding to Secretariat 2×2 on a six-generation pedigree page, you may not get any one specific desirable quality from him or might get only one characteristic. For example the chestnut color only but none of the structural characteristics such as skeletal and muscular conformation, or any of the functional qualities such as the galloping action, speed and acceleration, stamina and racing ability.\n\nThus inbreeding on a pedigree page means absolutely nothing more than the pedigree page unless the characteristics and qualities of the breeding stock – (stallion and broodmare) – involved in the close inbreeding are understood, evaluated and practiced with attention to each and every detail.\n\nSo how do we go about inbreeding in a productive fashion to produce the smashing super horse?\n\nWe solve this puzzle – of obtaining racing ability and conformation – by inbreeding in the Thoroughbred, using the tool available to manipulate the genetic puzzle and concentrate the desirable benefits with this much maligned and much praised practice.\n\nFIRST, when you inbreed you must inbreed to influential and dominant, yes dominant, individuals who have proven themselves to be such beyond any question by the test of TIME.\n\nThis would mean that such influential horses would have shown tremendous racing ability on the racetrack and then shown the ability to reproduce those traits in their offspring. Such individuals can be stallions or mares, but they must be influential in transmission of their own specific characteristics.\n\nIn recent times, such individuals amongst stallions would be Bold Ruler, Northern Dancer, Ribot, Native Dancer, Turn-to, Raise a Native and so on. Amongst the mares, such individuals would be Cosmah, Almahmood, La Troienne, Grey Flight and so on. It is not necessary to limit yourself to these, but you may want to inbreed to St. Simon or Teddy, and you can do that by using animals who are inbred to these great Thoroughbreds. In fact, Tesio did do that when he produced RIBOT who has, I think, 16 or 17 crosses of St. Simon.\n\nSECOND, if you wish to inbreed, you must utilize individual mares and stallions who do in fact possess the functional – (racing ability, speed, stamina, etc) – qualities of the individual to whom you intend to inbreed.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to inbreed to Raise a Native, the source (stallion or mare) related to Raise a Native must possess the one quality that he is known for – speed and acceleration (function).\n\nThere is no point in inbreeding to Raise a Native through a son or daughter of his who had lacked speed because that horse obviously did not inherit this required quality of the Raise a Native sire line.\n\nAt the same time, if you are inbreeding to Raise a Native, you must keep in mind the unsoundness of bones that goes with his strain. So you should use stallions and mares who were sound themselves.\n\nIf you are inbreeding to Ribot, the source animals must possess the quality that Ribot is known for, namely soundness, stamina, and the ability to accelerate going a distance.\n\nIf you are inbreeding to Nasrullah, size, soundness, speed, and temperament must be present in the source of animals and so on.\n\nTHIRD, when you plan on inbreeding to a specific horse, it is better to do it through differing sources, such as full brothers or brothers and sisters who do themselves possess the quality of the ancestor to whom you are inbreeding.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\nIf you wish to inbreed to Northern Dancer, it would be of great benefit to duplicate his name through different sources, such as by breeding a son of Lyphard to a daughter of Nureyev or of Nijinsky. This has the added benefit of providing differing physical characteristics, while perhaps reducing some of the less desirable qualities of the sire line. From Nijinsky, you could obtain size and substance while getting quality from Nureyev or Lyphard.\n\nFOURTH, do not try to separate the yolk from the egg white. If you are trying to in-breed to Ribot, don’t be too upset about bad temper as that is part of the Ribot package or trademark – call it what you may.\n\nThe bad front legs of the In Reality line is a similar trademark. In Reality is inbred to War Relic, who is in bred to Rock Sand and Fairy Gold – all of whom had less than perfect front legs.\n\nThe late maturation of bone in the Raise a Native sire lines must be taken into account and accepted when inbreeding to this sire. One of the main reasons for the so-called unsoundness of this strain is that mentally and physically the young horses from this sire line mature very early, but their bones mature much later. The end result is that many 2-year-olds with a great deal of speed are allowed to self-destruct as their bones are not yet ready to withstand the stress of racing or even fast gallops or breezes.\n\nRegarding bad temperament, inbreeding by itself cannot be blamed for the occurrence of bad temper. Many outbred horses have been well known to transmit their evil disposition in a dominant fashion, such as Hastings, Barcaldine, Tristan, Mata Hari, Nasrullah etc.\n\nAnd finally inbreeding is only a plan where the odds of breeding good horses may be improved directly in proportion to the amount of detailed work that is done in regard to proper selection of breeding stock and carefully selecting the strains that you are trying to reinforce. If you wish to produce consistent results in your breeding of racehorses, the only real tool available is inbreeding.\n\nYou might inbreed to Northern Dancer through a son who has no race record and get only the skeletal and muscular structure (conformation) without the expected racing ability. But if you inbreed to Northern Dancer through Nureyev or Nijinsky, through Storm Bird or better still through Sadler’s Wells, you are much more likely to benefit from the planned concentration of the desired genetic pool.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were to inbreed to Secretariat, who is not a dominant stallion, it is less likely that you would obtain the desired result. The reason is that even though you are planning to place the name of Secretariat in a 3×3 position and expecting the characteristics of the Big Red Racing Machine, what the same in-breeding also does is to inbreed to Secretariat’s ancestors, such as Bold Ruler or Princequillo, any one of whom might act as a dominant factor and transmit qualities that you had not planned for in the resultant foal.\n\nOn the other hand, once you inbreed to a dominant animal such as Northern Dancer or Bold Ruler or Raise a Native, the chances of such an unexpected happening are less, as these stallions are known to be dominant in passing their physical traits, even when they sire foals with no inbreeding, as their sire record shows. So inbreed to dominant stallions and dominant mares and dominant female families.\n\nThis is where the advantages of inbreeding remain. Inbreed to dominant and influential animals through their offspring who have shown the preferred inherited characteristics of the dominant ancestors. Then and then only, the results will be consistent and satisfactory to the breeder.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the inbreeding that actually takes place today is either accidental (fortuitous or inadvertent) or planned by those that do not have access to top-class stallions and mares, and they inbreed using less than first-class animals, with less than first-class results. This counter-selective sort of inbreeding is reported by students of bloodstock and analyzed by pedigree experts and writers in the press. And it is this practice of inbreeding which is blamed or credited with whatever the results are.\n\nIf one examines the record of deliberately planned inbreeding done by breeders who have the means to use first-class breeding stock and who inbreed to dominant stallions and mares, it has been a phenomenal success and is in fact responsible for the renowned success of horses like Flying Fox, Buckpasser, Turn-to, In Reality, Roberto, Seattle Slew, Herbager, Ribot, and others.\n\nThe history of Thoroughbred racehorses would be very different had these courageous breeders not had the faith and conviction and the resources to do what they did. Lord Derby, Col. Hall Walker, Federico Tesio, and Marcel Boussac are the icons of inbreeding. As a matter of fact, without deliberately planned in-breeding the racehorse as we know it today would not have existed.\n\nFor today, inbreeding to Mr. Prospector through Woodman, Conquistador Cielo, Forty Niner, and Majestic Light would provide an excellent possibility to concentrate speed, acceleration, and class while minimizing the problems of unsoundness and front leg confirmation defects.\n\nOne could inbreed to Bold Ruler through the sons of Seattle Slew and the daughters of Secretariat (AP Indy) or to Northern Dancer through the sons of Nureyev and Nijinsky with daughters of Storm Bird and Lyphard. This would make a great deal of sense if the sources (mares-stallions) used were excellent animals in terms of race record, female family etc.\n\nPrepotency and inbreeding\n\nRibot, Nearco, Northern Dancer, and Raise a Native, Bold Ruler, Turn-to, and Native Dancer are dominant stallions. Inbreeding to them would tend to re-create and enhance their characteristics. The resultant foals will – if they are true genetic types – possess the desired qualities of their ancestors. And that is the aim of inbreeding.\n\nOn the other hand, inbreeding to animals who have not shown dominance (such as To Market, Secretariat, and most others) in siring superior racehorses themselves, will not re-create what they did not have, namely genetic prepotency, and thus inbreeding to them will not achieve the enhanced genetic transmission of racing ability in the resultant foals.\n\nWhat may happen in some of the latter situations is that fortuitous – (inadvertent) – inbreeding to one of the ancestors will occur which might result in unexpectedly good results.\n\nEXAMPLE: Spectacular Bid in-bred to To Market 3×3\n\nNow the sire line of To Market is dead for all practical purposes and he is not known for being a top broodmare sire either. Therefore, he is certainly not a dominant or influential stallion. So inbreeding to To Market in Spectacular Bid’s pedigree has very little to do with his racing ability – (exceptional) – and has certainly not enhanced his siring ability in spite of the books of exceptional broodmares that he was bred to early in his years at stud.\n\nAnother example of close inbreeding is Broad Brush, inbred to Turn-to 3×3, but he is by Ack Ack, whose sire line is hanging by a thread. So even though Broad Brush is inbred, he is by a less-dominant sire. Turn-to is known to be a dominant and influential stallion, even though he is known to sire unsound stock. I believed that Broad Brush would sire runners of exceptional ability though they might tend to be unsound. They proved both more talented and more sound than the odds could have predicted.\n\nAnd last, you have to believe that inbreeding does work and is responsible for the great racehorses of yesteryear and also is the only tool left for breeders to pursue and re-create excellence. You must think about incorporating it into your breeding plans. All the rest is superfluous. To concentrate an improved genetic pool must be pursued with care and diligence in selecting proper breeding stock. Regardless of the physical attributes, what matters in a Thoroughbred racehorse is his genetic make-up, and nothing else matters.\n\nIf Tesio had asked the statisticians before planning his matings, there would be no Nearco nor Ribot.\n\nIf Col. Hal Walker had measured his horses with tapes and rulers, the result would have been far from Blandford, Princequillo, and Bahram (bred from Hall Walker lines).\n\nAnd if Lord Derby’s team had consisted of critics of inbreeding, inbreeding to Pilgrimage would never have been practiced, and thus no Swynford, no Blandford, no Blenheim, no Nasrullah, no Bold Ruler, no Secretariat, and so on.\n\nDuring my recent hiatus from blogging, I was clearing work right and left. Good thing too, but the effect was surprising because one reader sent in some fascinating statistical information with a request to post.\n\nThe Pedigree Perfessor (sic), who did the research for this study and prefers to remain anonymous for reasons unrelated to the numbers, undertook a study of Thoroughbreds inbred to broodmares. This mating pattern, known under the popular title of the Rasmussen Factor in honor of former Daily Racing Form columnist Leon Rasmussen, has had a considerable vogue among breeders and pedigree enthusiasts.\n\nTo evaluate the results of using inbreeding to broodmares, the Pedigree Perfessor chose to create some different statistical tools to assess pedigrees in terms of price ranges, and that process is described below, along with the details of how he conducted the study.\n\n*************\n\nThe Rasmussen Factor 201\n\n“Evidence from these studies indicates that pedigrees should be judged\n\nprimarily upon the basis of the first and second generations and that\n\nancestors beyond the third generation may for all practical purposes\n\nbe ignored.”\n\nAnyone care to identify the source of this quote? It is a good one to\n\nkeep in mind as I begin today’s lecture on the Rasmussen Factor, named\n\nfor late DRF columnist Leon Rasumussen. Here is a definition of the\n\nRasmussen Factor (RF) from Racehorse Breeding Theories, page 239:\n\n“The Rasmussen Factor (RF) occurs when there is a duplication of a female ancestor, between the individual’s sire and dam, within five generations (5×5 or closer).”\n\nI decided it would be fun to identify all individual Thoroughbreds\n\nfrom a large group who qualify as RF and evaluate their overall performance.\n\nI settled upon all weanlings, yearlings, and 2-year-olds sold at public\n\nauction in North America in 1999-2002 as that large group. These sales\n\nfoals are somewhat better in quality than all foals, and their prices give\n\nan indication of how good they were perceived to be (including both pedigree and conformation) before they started racing.\n\nI began with 1999 for the simple reason that the abode of all bliss\n\nat which I slave for a living (which shall remain unnamed) has a\n\nlibrary of sorts, and the most current copy of Blood-Horse Auctions\n\nof XXXX they had was 1999. So I started with 1999 and worked my way\n\nforward, acquiring later copies of that valuable (and now discontinued)\n\nreference work along the way. After four years, 1999-2002, I had\n\nexamined more than 54,000 pedigrees and had identified almost 4,000\n\nRF qualifiers. I decided that was a sufficiently large group to evaluate.\n\nTable 1 lists the RF qualifiers I found who were sold in 1999, Table 2\n\ndoes the same for 2000, Table 3 for 2001, and Table 4 for 2002. The first column lists the name of the qualifier. If unnamed, a pedigree is listed on the line below (sex, sire-dam, broodmare sire). I originally intended to list pedigrees on all qualifiers, but the lists got to be quite lengthy as they are, and nowadays there are more free sources for looking up pedigrees than there were when I started this project several years ago.\n\nSo if you are really curious about the pedigrees involved, look them up.\n\nGenerally speaking, because I used the listings in Blood-Horse Auctions of XXXXX, which are alphabetical by sire, Tables 1-2-3-4 are the same,\n\nalphabetical by sire.\n\nThe next column lists the price, with W for weanlings, Y for yearlings, and T for 2-year-olds (dollar signs omitted). I should point out that I looked up nags sold in North America ONLY. I ignored the nags listed as being sold in European countries because those listings were far from complete.\n\nThe next column lists the duplication(s) involved. If more than one,\n\nthe additional duplications are on additional lines.\n\nThe last column gives the racing class of the nag: UP for unplaced,\n\nUR for unraced, PL for placed, W for winner, SP for stakes placed\n\n(but not a winner), SPW for stakes-placed winner, and SW for stakes\n\nwinner. With a few exceptions, stakes winners will be listed separately\n\nin part two of this lecture. The exceptions are those stakes winners\n\nwho sold in more than one year. Those stakes winners will be listed\n\nin part two along with all the other stakes winners. They are also\n\nlisted in Tables 1-2-3-4 as SW(PH) (stakes winner pinhooked).\n\nObviously, many of these nags sold more than once. Within this study, a horse could have sold as a weanling, yearling, and 2-year-old. In that case, he is listed in three different tables and counted as three foals. If a\n\nhorse sold more than once in the same year, however, I took an average of its selling prices and listed it as only one foal.\n\nI listed the race records of these nags for information only.\n\nFor purposes of evaluation, it does not matter if they are unplaced,\n\nunraced, placed, a winner, or stakes placed. The only thing that\n\nmatters is whether or not they are a stakes winner (by black-type\n\nrules; [N] winners need not apply). The actual method of evaluation\n\nwill be explained and discussed in part two.\n\nOK. I think that explains Tables 1-2-3-4. If you examine them even\n\ncursorily, you will see that most of the names of the females\n\nduplicated are very familiar, led by Almahmoud and Somethingroyal.\n\nThose two names combined account for a little more than 25% of all the RF qualifiers in Tables 1-2-3-4.\n\nSomethingroyal appears to be gaining in popularity over Almahmoud.\n\nThe latter showed up more often than the former overall, but the former showed up more often than the latter in 2001-02. Perhaps a better way to state this is that Almahmoud is receding more quickly than Somethingroyal is (which is a function of Northern Dancer receding beyond the third generation).\n\nSome of the names of the females duplicated in Tables 1-2-3-4 are NOT nearly as familiar. I thought it might be fun to go through some of the more obscure names and explain who they were and what claims to “superiority,” if any, they possess.\n\nWho the heck was First Rose, for example? First Rose was a 1946 filly by Menow — Rare Bloom, by Sir Gallahad III. She won two of seven starts and earned $6,750. She produced one stakes winner, the Bolero filly Bolero Rose. If you do not know the stakes winner Bolero Rose produced and where that leads in modern pedigrees, you probably need to go back to Names in Pedigrees 101 (a prerequisite for this course) and take that class over again.\n\n“Was Amber Dancer the dam of Amberoid (1966 Belmont Stakes winner)?” one scribe asked me over lunch not too long ago.\n\nNo, Amberoid was by Count Amber — Spencerian, by Destino. Amber Dancer was a 1963 unraced daughter of Native Dancer — Occasionally, by Ambiorix. She produced one stakes winner, Schuylerville S.-G2 winner Our Dancing Girl, and is the second dam of Island Whirl (a G1 winner and earner of $1,144,010).\n\nYang was an unraced daughter of Turn-to — Mrs. Moss, by Mr. Music.\n\nShe produced two stakes winners, including the Drum Fire colt Knights Choice. For extra credit, can anyone tell me (preferably without consulting any computers or reference books) what G1 winner was sired by Knights Choice?\n\nCory Road is listed in Table 1 as a $2,200 2-year-old. A filly by Naevus Star — Reyadance, by Dance in Time, she is the most closely inbred nag in Tables 1-2-3-4, being 2×2 to Spanish Speed, a daughter of El Pitirre who was unplaced in two starts. Naevus Star was a stakes winner, however. So Spanish Speed does have some claim to “superiority.” Cory Road, the product of this 2×2 mating, won six of 31 starts and earned $31,827, which is not too bad for a $2,200 sales animal.\n\nChalledella was a 1946 filly by Challedon — Lawler, by Chicle. She won one of 16 starts and earned $2,740. She produced Golden Rod Stakes winner Sequent and is the fourth dam of Travers Stakes-G1 winner Thunder Rumble, the sire of the foal in question (Winters Thunder) in Tables 1-2-3.\n\nKlinchit was a 1954 filly by War Dog — Whosis, by Raphael II. She won nine of 92 starts and earned $15,021. Klinchit produced two stakes winners, Mr. Clinch ($253,763) and Bill and I ($111,920). The latter is the third dam of Dehere.\n\nRadio Time was a 1945 filly by Eight Thirty — Lull, by Bull Dog. She won three of 15 starts and earned $11,050. Radio Time produced two stakes winners, including Li’l Fella ($283,845 and a moderate sire). Radio Time is the fourth dam of Devil His Due.\n\nNew Love was a 1963 filly by Pardal — Stavroula, by Nasrullah. She won one of seven starts and earned $3,605. New Love produced American Derby-G1 winner Determined King ($218,840) and is the third dam of Louis Quatorze. For extra credit, can anyone tell me (preferably without consulting any computers or reference books) what earner\n\nof more than $1 million was sired by Determined King?\n\nLester’s Pride was a 1957 filly by Model Cadet — Meadow Flower, by Bull Lea. She won three of 19 starts and earned $9,670. Lester’s Pride produced three stakes winners, including champion sprinter Shecky Greene. Her name might seem obscure now because Shecky Greene is not often seen in modern pedigrees.\n\nBroomflight was a 1947 filly by Deil — Air Post, by Ariel. She won three of 17 starts and earned $3,340. Broomflight produced three stakes winners, including Bunty’s Flight, the broodmare sire of Deputy Minister.\n\nRed Sunset was a 1941 filly by Solario — Dulce, by Asterus. She was a winner in England and produced the stakes winner Sunny Way. Red Sunset was also the dam of Rasper II, not a stakes winner but a pretty good sire who appears in the pedigree of Gulch. A daughter of Red Sunset, Crepuscule, produced four stakes winners, including Crepello, a classic winner, leading sire, and leading broodmare sire in England.\n\nMagnificent was a 1950 filly by Migoli — Isle of Capri, by Fair Trial. She was a winner in England and produced stakes winner Right of Way, who appears in the pedigree of Chilean champion and contemporary sire Memo.\n\nFair Freedom was a 1945 unraced filly by Fair Trial — Democratie, by Epinard. She produced the stakes winners Marshal Ney II, Liberal Lady, and Be Careful II. Fair Freedom is the third dam of classic winners Julio Mariner, Juliette Marny, and Scintillate. Additionally, she is the second dam of Christmas Wind, who produced Winter’s Tale (a G1 winner and earner of $888,900) and is the second dam of Red Ransom.\n\nOld Bess was a 1948 filly by Vincentive — Movie Lass, by Kai-Finn. She was unplaced in two starts and produced two stakes winners, including the moderate sire O’Calaway. She is the third dam of Montbrook, sire of Super Derby-G1 winner Outofthebox, who is 4×3 to Old Bess.\n\nFanciful Miss was a 1954 filly by King Dorsett — Hianne, by Jack High.

She produced stakes winners Raise Your Skirts and Cold Buns.\n\nAll of the mares discussed above produced at least one stakes winner and had at least some claim to “superiority.” The following mares were not stakes winners and did not produce any stakes winners.\n\nMost recognizable of these is Mixed Marriage, who is considered a “star” mare (the female equivalent of a chef-de-race), for whatever that is worth. Mixed Marriage was a 1952 filly by Tudor Minstrel — Persian Maid, by Tehran. A winner in Ireland, she produced stakes-placed Croatan as well as Atan, a winner in 1 start and the sire of Sharpen Up. Mixed Marriage is also the ancestress of Gone West, Known Fact, Tentam, etc., and as such is well represented in modern pedigrees.\n\nBebop II was a 1957 filly by Prince Bio — Cappellina, by Le Capucin.

More importantly, she is renowned as the second dam of Affirmed.\n\nSubterranean was a 1947 unraced filly by By Jimminy — U-Boat, by Man o’ War. She produced one stakes-placed horse but is better remembered as the third dam of Seattle Song and the fifth dam of Unbridled’s Song.\n\nQuit Me Not was a 1973 filly by Bold Reason — Aspidistra, by Better Self, and hence a half-sister to Dr. Fager and Ta Wee.

Suffisante produced stakes-placed Sinope and Ste Nitouche. The former is her main claim to “superiority,” being the second dam of Sandpit.\n\nThe 17 mares discussed above are the only ones in Tables 1-2-3-4 who were not a stakes winner and did not produce any stakes winners. Nevertheless, they all had some claim to “superiority,” as did all of the obscure mares discussed above. Most of these mares have some link to modern pedigrees as well. Otherwise, they would not even appear in modern pedigrees and have a chance to be duplicated there, correct?\n\n“Inbreeding to Superior Females Through Different Individuals”\n\nwas the title of the address Rasmussen gave at an important breeding symposium in Sydney, Australia, in 1993. He also coauthored the book Inbreeding to Superior Females, which was published in 1999. Note that the word “superior” has been dropped from the definition of RF published in Racehorse Breeding Theories in 2004.\n\nIt really does not matter one way or the other. The 17 mares discussed above account for about 50 foals (and one stakes winner) in Tables 1-2-3-4. If they were to be declared not “superior” and dropped from the results, it would make very little difference.\n\nWhen I first started looking at pedigrees for this pattern, eventually to be named RF, 20-plus years ago, I was looking at all foals, not just sales foals. Hence I found quite a few nags inbred 2×2 or so to the likes of Reno Gal, by Reno Boy, to use fictional names — inbred to mares of no claim to superiority whatsoever, in other words.\n\nWhy would anyone do that, inbreed to mares of absolutely no distinction? Probably because Rasmussen and others had been preaching for years that inbreeding to mares is good, regardless of superiority or the lack thereof. Among these sales foals, the pedigrees are somewhat better, and I did not find any examples of inbreeding to a mare of no distinction whatsoever. Even Spanish Speed (mentioned above) was a stakes producer. Ergo, “superiority” is a moot point. If a female ancestor is duplicated through different individuals, it qualifies as RF, just like the definition quoted says. Obviously some of these duplicated mares are better than others, but I am more interested in the overall results for all qualifiers than results for individual mares.\n\nIn part two of this lecture I will list the stakes winners among the RF qualifiers, evaluate the group as a whole, and explain my methods of evaluation. I will also delve into results for duplicating second, third, fourth, and fifth dams, a subset of the RF group.\n\n*********************************************\n\nPart 2 coming soon."
