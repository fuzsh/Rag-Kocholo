I like Gone West. I’ve heard of course things about Storm Cat and Halo. I’m planning on seeing this horse today but would love thoughts on his pedigree!\n\nLooking for a dressage prospect and something sane!! I’m good with sensitive types but need something with some “try.”\n\nThis is a good pedigree, but not for dressage movement, in my opinion. This is a pedigree for an eventer.\n\nI don’t know if you would have dressage movement with this horse. You would definitely have jumping ability. It’s nice to see Lost Code up so close, relatively speaking. He is almost always buried in the back… but that was a stallion that made very hardy, enduring horses. It’s a shame he was not more successful in racing progeny, because I found his offspring to be wonderful with good temperaments in their second careers.\n\nSpeightstown has some good looking horses near me. I notice they tend to be more compact, decent movers, great jumpers. A little spicy. That comes from the Gone West, btw, not the Storm Cat. Storm Cat will give you lots of athleticism and no bottom. We’re quite far back now, though.\n\nAll of the stallions mentioned above, have average movement in terms of dressage. SC made some very dressage-moving sons, though (Giant’s Causeway, for example).\n\nWhat’s better is the Honor And Glory and Relaunch (In Reality). This is a proven line for eventing, and a good line for dressage. Honor And Glory in my experience made substantial, good minded horses. It’s a shame he was not used more often in sport-breeding. In my experience this line is good moving, very nicely conformed for sport, and excellent jumpers. And sound!\n\nJust speaking from personal experience…\n\nI sent a dressage prospect (pedigree and conformation) to Beowulf last year just from reading some of their posts here in the forum. He/She was so spot on it was scary. This horse is everything I was hoping for and more and even shut the traps of some dressage naysayers that told me not to get an OTTB. My GP clinician loved him and he continues to impress, though we haven’t even gotten into the serious work yet. I wouldn’t hesitate to reach out to Beowulf again if I was ever in the market for another.\n\ndam was a turf sprinter, winning a listed stakes race at Belmont. 3rd dam was the dandy G1 winner Jeanne Jones. Seems to have a speed orientation. Sire Hat Trick is one of the few sons of Sunday Silence available to North American breeders. He’s been exported to Brazil now.\n\nFor what it’s worth this is the link to her catalog sales page when she sold at the 2017 Maryland 2 year in training sale for $25,000.\n\nhttp://www.fasigtipton.com/catalogs/2017/0522/405.pdf\n\nThis is the link to the video of her breezing/working before she sold\n\nhttp://www.fasigtipton.com/node/583#/uts/videos/39996\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nThanks guys! Unfortunately horse had a large knee and wasn’t sound. But I appreciate the information as I’ll continue to look!"
