        "text": "Perfection!\n\nHow many horse people can say that?\n\nAbout their horse?\n\nAbout their ride?\n\nAbout their trail access?\n\nAbout their horse-and-child motherhood?\n\nI can — and I think, after fiftysomething horse years, I’ve earned it :))))\n\nDawnHoof\n\nMy first horse, Rebel, in Western tack. I was the only Western rider at the English barn in Pacific Palisades, CA., where I boarded him — thankfully adjacent to endless trails for our adventures :))\n\n~~~~\n\nThink about it.\n\nHorses draw people from every walk of life.\n\nBarrel races.\n\nThoroughbred races.\n\nRodeo.\n\nJumping.\n\nEventing.\n\nDressage.\n\nVaulting.\n\nRoping.\n\nReining.\n\nCarriage driving.\n\nTrail riding.\n\nEndurance riding . . .\n\nThere are disciplines and breeds available for every type of human personality within the great umbrella of “Horses”.\n\nMy passion has always been to get out — hit the trails — cut loose — and experience the harmony and freedom that riding a good horse out in Nature offers.\n\nAs a farrier for more than thirty years, I’m a horse pro. And I’ve witnessed lots and lots of horse/human relationships.\n\nI’m always happy when a horse and human are well-matched. When the needs of the horse and the goals of the human seem to line up. Mutual satisfaction oozes from the contentment of both.\n\nGood vibes rule the day . . .\n\nHorses and riders in Waimanalo, Oahu (Hawaii) caught by my camera while enjoying the day :))\n\n~~~~\n\nYet this is not always the case.\n\nSometimes, a person acquires a horse that just isn’t up for the intended purpose for which that person dreamed of.\n\nPerhaps physical limitations prevent the magic from aligning, in either horse, or rider.\n\nPerhaps temperament — the horse is nervous and spooky and won’t settle nicely in to what the owner wants to accomplish. (Or the owner’s temperament is disparate to that of the horse.)\n\nMaybe a trail rider can’t find a stable for her horse that’s near a good trail network.\n\nOr accident, age, or injury interrupts the flow.\n\nSo many things can get in the way of our horse dreams!\n\n~~~~\n\nSo when everything goes well.\n\nWhen horse and rider emerge from winter hiatus, like my mare, Fae and I, yesterday, and merge as one in absolute perfection — rider take note!\n\nFor this is not a “given”.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the mare I bred twentysomething years ago will still be sound and willing and ready to hit the trails with velveteen smoothness, responding moment-to-moment, to my slightest cue.\n\nOur ranch, at 5.500′ elevation, is here in the Southern California Los Padres National Forest, surrounded by peaks and ridges raising as high as 8,000′ (Frazier Park area). Our location is off the infamous Grapevine section of the I-5 Freeway, about sixty miles inland from Santa Barbara and Ojai.\n\nWe get rain, snow and storms in the winter here, making the ground saturated or frozen, so we only have about a May – November riding window to get out and enjoy our local trails.\n\nOnce the muddy winter ground dries up, I start conditioning the horses by galloping them down in our big level corral, about an acre in size. They buck and spin and cavort, running off winter’s nervous energy, building wind and muscle which has laid dormant over the past five or six months.\n\nThe first great day to ride presented itself yesterday — a day off work for me, and temperatures up to the 50s. (That beats the 30s and 40s!)\n\nSo I pep-talked myself, “You can do this, Dawn!” I wrapped my neck in two cashmere scarves, donned boots and gloves and headed out to the ranch to ride!\n\nFor my first ride of the season, Fae, my homebred Appy/Shire cross mare — mother of Aria and Laddie (daughter of my original mare, Fanta — see beach ride photo of Dawn with daughter Ella, age 5) — was today’s mount of choice.\n\n(The others are great, too, Aria and Laddie — but I did have to choose, and Fae won today’s lottery :))\n\nComing out of winter there will surely be newly fallen pine trees across the trail that we’ll have to navigate around. This happens every winter, especially a wet winter like we had this year, when winds topple trees from their earth-sodden roots.\n\nAnd Fae is a good choice to preview any stitcharounds that will be needed because of the fallen trees.\n\n‘Malibu Riders’* Horses on trail in Zuma Canyon, Malibu — *a trail riding operation\n\n~~~~\n\nPrepping a horse to ride is not unlike preparing to take a toddler to the market on a shopping errand. You don’t just throw them in the car and hope for the best. You consider their needs, and plan for them, accordingly.\n\nI accommodate Fae’s wants and needs before, during and after the ride. In return, she willingly carries me and responds to my most subtle aids.\n\nBefore we go, after galloping off any nervous edge or energy she might have, there in the corral, she gets to graze on grass that grows nearby. Yum!\n\nThen I lead her to the hitching area, where she gets two scoops of alfalfa pellets to fill any hunger, and make her feel loved and cared for.\n\nAfter she’s groomed and the pad and saddle go on, she gets yummy horse cookies to help her breathe, ease and relax as I adjust and snug up her girth.\n\nThen, I bring out the bridle and place the reins over Fae’s head. Fae knows the drill. She opens her mouth, lowers her head and dives for the bit with moving lips as if to say, “Yes! Let’s get out and go!”\n\nMore cookies reward this willing behavior.\n\n~~~~\n\nOf note — my wonderful handyman husband made me the very best wooden mounting block about a decade ago.\n\nHaving worked in Hawaii shoeing horses, flying back and forth from LAX (Los Angeles) to HNL (Honolulu) for two weeks out of every six weeks over the course of fourteen years, I had opportunity to travel back in horse time to a simpler way of living.\n\nOver there, in the Islands, big wooden mounting blocks like the ones at stables when I was a kid, are still in service. I took measurements, and Rick reproduced one for me :))\n\nSo leading Fae to the broad, three-step mounting block, and climbing onto her large frame into my secure Western Australian saddle, was a breeze.\n\nHorse art on the side of a wooden mounting block at a stable in Southern California\n\n~~~~\n\nLeaving the ranch, we swing into a walk for the five-minute trek to the narrow forest trailhead gate — a technical and difficult obstacle that Fae allows me to open and close expertly, while still mounted — no small feat!\n\n(Many horses have had meltdowns and incidents here — thank heaven for Fae’s intelligent skillset!)\n\nAnd now we’ve entered our Forest-Nirvana!\n\nOur forest in fall, on Aria\n\n~~~~\n\nOne and a half hours later, about six miles covered, heading up technical-snag-ridden, scrub oak single track trail to the wide open yellow-carpeted gold-field flower-covered meadow, stitching into the wider trail, off we fly . . .\n\nCantering. Silky smooth.\n\nLoose rein.\n\nHips following hoofbeats, flowing in unison.\n\nHorse and Horsegirl’s Paradise!\n\nWhere two become One.\n\nWhispering praises, “‘Atta girls!” and “Wows!”\n\nTo the horse.\n\nTo the movement.\n\nTo the intuitive connection between us.\n\nTo the virgin forest.\n\nTo the pristine day.\n\nTo the horse I bred and raised and trained —\n\nAnd twentysomething years later,\n\nStill meld with,\n\nStill One . . .\n\nFae tree shadow shot on Mt. Pinos\n\n~~~~\n\nI’m a bit sore in my legs and lower back today, but that’s already loosening up. A small price to pay for Perfection!\n\n(For a riding Pep Talk, see my posts, Boot Up and Why Ride?)\n\nSo I’m here to encourage you horse guys and gals —\n\nTime to get off the couch,\n\nGet on those boots,\n\nGrab out your horse,\n\nAnd RIDE!\n\n:))))\n\nDawnHoof\n\n~~~~\n\nFanta, Fae’s mother (dam) in Malibu —\n\nMamma Dawn with daughter Ella on the run!\n\nEnjoying Life!!! (1993)\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2024\n\nPhotographs: Dawn Jenkins and family archives, Marci Cunningham endurance photo\n\n~~~~\n\nPlease come over to Dawn’s Life blog — Journal of Dawn —\n\nfor Strategies and Insights into the\n\nJourney of Life.\n\nFind out more about Dawn’s HoofCare Services and Soul Horse Rides in the\n\nFrazier Park Outback of Southern California :))\n\n~~~~\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHere’s a ride from 2008 recorded in my journal, when I moved a couple of my horses back to the mountains in Malibu — off Decker and Encinal Canyon Rd. — near pristine Charmlee Park.\n\nSince it’s a hundred miles from my now-Frazier-Park-home, I’d work all day shoeing and trimming horse’s hooves nearby in Malibu, then camp outside my corral for a night or two, getting in a ride when I could — many in the dark of night.\n\nMy journal records peaceful nights, spent outside my horses’ large pasture-style hilltop corral:\n\nTwilight at ZachaRosa Ranch\n\nThe sky hangs orange, thick, against the distant Boney Ridge. Smoke from a host of Northern California fires influences the air even here in Malibu.\n\nI sit in my car and type. Young Sycamore trees silhouette the skyline. Crickets croon in rolling unison.\n\nIt’s warm. We’ve had a heat wave up in our mountains, and it’s cooler here by the beach. I just brought the horses back (to this ranch) to get in a few Malibu summer rides.\n\nI hear the sounds of horses munching, walking, whinnying — and response. One-two-three-four-five whinny’s in succession, from far away, to right next to me.\n\nIt makes me smile. I feel at home.\n\nMentor in Malibu\n\n~~~~\n\nYet the night of this writing, I was apparently in some kind of mental funk.\n\nMuch of what we do with our horses is by discipline and years of logged muscle memory.\n\nMore often than not, especially as we get older, we horse enthusiasts require more discipline to accomplish the physically challenging task of mounting up, and going for a ride — especially wilderness rides! Especially at NIGHT!!! (See my post Why Ride?)\n\nLooking back on it now, I’m amazed at my endeavor. Working all day physically, shoeing and trimming horse hooves in the hundred degree heat, and then trusting myself and my horses to head out into the darkness, into the Malibu mountain vastness, on our own . . . and feel at home . . . quite a feat!\n\nAt the time in my mid-fifties, no less!\n\n(I also see telltale signs of hypoglycemia that night — low blood sugar — and dehydration from the day’s work, which must have added to my mental funk.)\n\nI had to make myself rally to get out my horses that night — in the fading day’s twilight. Saddle up and climb on one horse (Mentor), leading (ponying) the other horse (Fauna), unsaddled, into the wildness, into the growing darkness . . .\n\n~~~~\n\nRiding into the Exotic\n\nSometimes the mind is a grist mill, crushing sheaves of chaff. Stuck, like a record, in a skip, in a rut. And this night is one.\n\nThe night is hot, dripping. I’m thinking 80 degrees. A clouded colorful sunset all that’s left of the hundred-degree August day.\n\nUnder the Eucalyptus trees, I stage a ridge-side picnic in the day’s final muted rays, straddling my three-legged stool, chomping my much-needed meal, forgetting the heavy work of the day.\n\nI go about like a robot. Lifeless. Waiting for the inspiration to hit. I certainly don’t feel like riding tonight.\n\nThese are the rides I make myself muster — on horseback, into the darkness, into the trails — to ease my harried mind.\n\nIt worked, it seems, as I slept quietly afterwards, and felt blessed relief.\n\nBut the ride itself was labored.\n\nThis time riding Mentor, ponying Fauna, my mind grinds on. Down the trail on the first steep hillside, across the paved road, around the gate and up the loosely turned tractor path.\n\nLooking out, dripping, waiting in vain for cool air to hit, we dither on. The lights of Trancas muted, in half-fog. Palos Verdes blotted out, as it been has all summer long.\n\n~~~~\n\nThere is a turning point in every ride, when exhaustion gives way to magic, when the mundane gives way to the exotic. Oftentimes it feels like it will never get here. Yet on each ride, no matter how difficult, I’ve come to know — I’ll find it.\n\nOn this ride, after entering Malibu’s Charmlee Park in the darkening twilight, it arrives when we turn toward the lay-line on the white sandy soil, glowing bright in the growing darkness.\n\nIt always seems to take a good 45 minutes to get into that flowing state — perhaps a magic number of sorts. Like some mathematical formula: pi [exotic zone] = 45-minute-riding-time.\n\n~~~~\n\nUpon entering this exotic zone, the wheels of my mental mill finally subside.\n\nNow, instead of hearing my own inner angst, I begin to turn outward, upward, into the rhythm of the ride.\n\nThe stars begin to sparkle. The treeline touches a place in my soul. The horizon opens up. And I become transported into the sublime.\n\nRiding the same ride, again and again, may seem similar, but never the same.\n\nThe night, the clarity of the stars, the twinkling quality (or not) of the lights. The horses mood. The trail combinations. Close encounters with coyotes or not — all make for a new and unique ride.\n\n~~~~\n\nTonight I decide to twist things up. Whatever I usually do, I’ll do differently.\n\nIt works.\n\nComing into the lookout from the wetlands offers smells and views I rarely get from the other direction.\n\nEach way I look, each turn of the trail, offers new vistas of the cloud cover, new reflections on the meadow, new silhouettes of the lone standing oak. And with each turn, I feel a new sense of relief.\n\nThis tree not an oak, but a favorite tree up Mt. Pinos\n\n~~~~\n\nThe meadow smells sweet tonight. Ripe. Sun-bleached. It shines bright under the starry canopy above, distinct from the dark tree-lined horizon.\n\nAmazingly, eyes adjust to the darkness. We see and perceive just fine.\n\nLike the cowboys of old, my horses and I feel nurtured and safe under the magical light of the stars.\n\nThe rhythm of hoofbeats soothes my soul. We are as much a part of this place as the animals who inhabit it.\n\nFauna tugs at the rope, reaching for a bite of tasty brush.\n\nMentor walks animated beneath me, without complaint. What a willing partner my good horse is!\n\nMentor spends his days standing in his pasture swishing flies, staring off, first one direction, then the next, moseying toward the water trough.\n\nHe has no idea what random day or hour I’ll drive up, hailing him with my familiar whistle. (I raised him from birth! It’s an intimate, life-long relationship.)\n\nMentor whinnies, ears pricked, at my call. I spend a few minutes fussing over him. I lead him out and saddle him. Bridle him. Mount upon his back, and nudge him on.\n\nWithout hesitation, he complies. Happily, eagerly. He carries me into my fantasy, whether directly out onto the trail or loaded into the trailer to haul to who-knows-where for who-knows-how-long.\n\nWonderful willing steed and companion!\n\n~~~~\n\n~~~~\n\nAll in all, we ride for close to two hours. Happy. Content. We lose track of time and angst and worry.\n\nNow we’re heading homeward. Uphill. Mentor puffs the still warm air. Fauna follows contentedly.\n\nLooking back, I fixate on the skyline. In my mind I take a photo of the glowing night scene.\n\nUnsaddling, in the darkness, I’m at ease now. The ride has worked its magic. Once again.\n\n~~~~\n\nHow great to find my long-ago notes and story I previously wrote about this one-out-of-hundreds of my rides.\n\nNight rides are very challenging, as they require an extrasensory awareness of horse, trails, footing, foliage (which can poke and rip and tear skin and clothing alike!), lurking predators, and so much more.\n\nSee my post, Adventurer of the Night, for another one of my nighttime rides.\n\nDawnHoof\n\nOther Charmlee Notes (from my 2009 journal)\n\nI awoke with sense of travel, of wonder. How horses are the key that unlock another dimension for us. Like riding Starboy with Holly and Bari one week ago, at Charmlee Park, in Malibu.\n\nI remember Holly asking me, as we saw each other at work one day, “What do you mean when you say that ‘Starboy’s a perfect horse?'” She just cannot understand. “What makes Starboy so special?”\n\n(Starboy is Mentor’s offspring, along with his full sister, Angel.)\n\nSo when the day arrives and we meet at up the canyon at ZachaRosa Ranch — this, an afternoon daylight ride — I realize that I shall put her on Starboy. I need to be on Fae, and Bari is good on Angel. And I need to make sure nothing happens to Holly, to keep her very safe. (She hadn’t ridden since her teen years.)\n\nSo I “pony” her, leading Starboy on a safety rope, just in case — she, to my left, on little Arab-cross Starboy, I on big wonderful Shire-cross Fae — Bari and Angel tagging along. And after a while I realize that Holly actually can ride.\n\nAh Ha!\n\nThirty years melt away, and Holly’s in the saddle, riding again! Once inside Charmlee Park, I free her from the rope, and Holly and Starboy are on their own.\n\nAnd she gets it!\n\nWith giggles and teenage enthusiasm of old, she sits his cadenced jog. “Oh, I see what you mean! Starboy is perfect!” Holly proclaims.\n\nWith a slight tilt of her seat she wills Starboy onward and he responds, ever reaching, ever pushing forward, carrying her into the Malibu end-of-day light.\n\nAnd now into the sunset with pale golden hues.\n\nAnd now deep twilight on the vast Pacific Horizon, against the gnarled silhouette of the Boney Ridge.\n\nAnd now the moon, nearly full, casting shadows toward the west, illuminates the meadow, the hillock, our path.\n\nThe ride, like the horse, contains perfection. And Holly giggles—sixteen again—rising and ebbing with her mount, like a wave.\n\nAbove the beach here in Malibu.\n\nHow awesome is that!!!\n\nRead more about Starboy here, here, here.\n\nRead about my magical Malibu childhood here.\n\nOf note: the Malibu ranch I once lived on with my horses, milk goats, and my girls when they were young, was bought by Country Singer Dwight Yoakam, who became my landlord back then — late ’80s-early ’90s.\n\nHere is the property now with a great video of the Boney Ridge and surroundings. Dwight named this twelve acre Yerba Buena Canyon ranch the “Boney Pony” and owned it for several years. It seems it’s now a health/yoga retreat.\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2008, 2009, 2024 Dawn Jenkins\n\nPhoto credits: Dawn Jenkins\n\n~~~~\n\nPlease visit my Life Blog, Journal of Dawn ,\n\nfor Strategies and Insights into the\n\nJourney of Life\n\n~~~~\n\nFind out more about Dawn’s HoofCare Services and Soul Horse Rides in the Frazier Park Outback of Southern California :))\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nUpdate: Wet Winter in California!\n\nRecent storms graced our region with over 200% of normal rainfall. Hallelujah! However, along with our watery wonders came soggy soil — and impossible horse riding conditions.\n\nA river of runoff poured through our corrals in recent weeks, saturating the earth and bogging every inch of ground.\n\nYet last week was sunny and clear; a wind dried out much of the land. I was able to unload and stack hay bales yesterday, just in time before the previous load was gone.\n\nAnd for the first time in two months, I was able to turn the horses out and let them gallop, reel, and spin-out their winter bucks on (mostly) solid ground.\n\nSo imagine my surprise this sunny Saturday morning, when I heard my little inner voice say: “You know, you could pull Laddie out and go for a ride today!”\n\nWhat? I reacted. I could ride? That would be awesome! . . . But I don’t usually ride in winter’s snow and cold in our mountains, and I haven’t saddled up and hopped on since November.\n\nA friend was just telling me, the first impulse when we get a good idea is: Yes! Let’s do it! . . . And then . . . Resistance sets in! And we tend to put it off . . . (and it tends to not get done, at all.)\n\nWhat about the hooves I should work on today? I thought. How about the boxes here at home I could go through? I haven’t ridden in such a long time! Will I even have the energy?\n\nThen it occurred to me, This is the first and only day, thus far this winter, that I actually could ride. The realization hit me . . . Seriously! I really can do this!\n\nSo I shifted my mindset, booted up and headed out to the horses.\n\n~~~~\n\nI did my chores out there, first — feed set-up and water trough cleaning — to save my end-of-day energy for a ride!\n\nOnce the work was done, I chased Lad in the corral for a quick trot and lope to clear out any possible remaining winter bucks — he appeared calm and relaxed today.\n\nPulling him out of the corral for the first time in so long, tied at my hitching spot, Lad seemed HUGE! For decades I raised smaller Arab-cross horses in my homebred herd, but when I added Shire (think Clydesdale), into my mix twentysomething years ago, all that changed.\n\nLaddie is not just big. Regal Beautiful. Elegant. He’s MASSIVE! (My husband points out, he’s also: Intelligent. Charismatic. Responsive. Caring for his rider . . . and that every girl falls in love with him! I must add, the guys do, too.)\n\nStanding next to Laddie, holding my Western Aussie saddle, looking up at his towering back, I wondered: Can I even get this heavy thing up there? Not having tossed on a saddle in so long, can my not-so-fit winter muscles still muster it?\n\nI tucked the girth and off-side stirrup over the saddle seat, counted to 3 and gave it the biggest heft I had . . .\n\nHallelujah! Horsegirl grit rules! (It’s all in that last moment ‘flip’ we’ve learned to do from all those horse-years of tossing saddles.)\n\nNow — to get on.\n\nChecking his girth, adjusting his bridle, leading Lad to the mounting block — I looked at the mountain of a horse, and it seemed foreign to attempt to climb on . . .\n\nWe humans are strange creatures. Like a pilot who hasn’t flown her craft recently, I felt awkward at the thought of throwing my leg over him. This is new for me! I’ve ridden for so many years, where is this hesitation coming from?\n\nBut it’s good, calm Lad, I mentally reassure myself, large as he is. And my saddle is tight. I checked again, just to make sure.\n\nUp and on.\n\n“Good boy, Lad!” I said out loud.\n\nAs we strode away, I had difficulty locating my off-side stirrup, having to reach down and twist the saddle fender in order to find it with my foot. (Usually it flops out to meet me, but not today.)\n\nFunny how the ageing process makes me feel more like a little kid than an accomplished adult, with fiftysomething years of riding, breeding, training, shoeing, caring for and interacting with horses . . .\n\nYet now I’m mounted, in my saddle, and through the gate we go!\n\n~~~~\n\nOut on the lane, the sun feels warm; the air cold.\n\nOnce in the woods, snow patches hide behind bushes;\n\nBoggy ground, crusted with ice, pools in the low spots.\n\nOne thing I know about riding horses — the farther away from home,\n\nThe more the Magic arises . . .\n\nA rhythm sets in. We find our pace.\n\nThe horse beneath me, and my own body, loosen up.\n\nThe trees speak. The saddle melds with horse and rider.\n\nTransformation occurs. Outside of ordinary time — into\n\nHorse time. Dream time.\n\nThe forest trees loom before me.\n\nThe same trees I’ve ridden through for nearly thirty years.\n\nYet this ride, as each ride — has its own special flavor.\n\nSunlight glints. Its low, end-of-winter-day angle, shines right into my eyes.\n\nIn my mind, I heard strains of Gordon Lightfoot’s song:\n\n“The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n\nI thought the sun rose in your eyes\n\nAnd the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave\n\nTo the night and the empty skies, my love,\n\nTo the night and the empty skies,”\n\nSo many firsts — the first time I’ve ridden in 2023.\n\nFinally, our drawn-out California drought over — at least for now.\n\nOur forest soaking the moisture into every root.\n\nGreen shoots sprouting at our 5,500′ elevation, even in January —\n\nSun in my eyes, where all winter, dark shadows have been.\n\nNow: lilting, dancing shadows.\n\nMy beloved Laddie carrying me, effortlessly.\n\nThe cadence. The hoofbeats. The unity between us.\n\nThe ease in which we share.\n\nLaddie moving gracefully to my slightest cue.\n\nPerfection!\n\nAnd so our steady path leads us,\n\nDetouring around newly fallen trunks and branches,\n\nPast now-filled water hollows, lined with ice in the shadows, like lace.\n\nThe ponds reflecting moss-colored trees and crisp blue sky —\n\nLad navigating the soft spots in the ground, steady,\n\nLike the seasoned trail horse that he is.\n\nI’m alive! I’m in my element, no matter\n\nAge or time constraints or other excuses!\n\n— Gordon Lightfoot singing, softly, in my mind . . .\n\nAnd this year our riding season promises abundant wildflowers —\n\nAbundant hope. On lovely Laddie, my faithful steed.\n\nWarm. Soft. Fluid. Yielding to my every whim.\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2023\n\nPhotos: Dawn Jenkins archives\n\n~~~~\n\nPlease also visit my Life Blog, Journal of Dawn ,\n\nfor Strategies and Insights into the\n\nJourney of Life\n\n~~~~\n\nJoin Dawn for a Soul Horse Ride!

He’d been fine to trim, great with his hinds, but awful for nailing his fronts!\n\n(And, with thin soles and rocky high-desert terrain, Red needs front shoes to keep sound.)\n\nAs soon as my hammer takes to nails, Red yanks and pulls his limb like a large-scale earthquake, worse on the right side.\n\nThat’s when I ask Red’s strong cowboy-owner to stand in front of his knee, hold his leg, and push with great might against Red’s protests, so I can get the nails in. (And he’s not quicked, as he’s sound afterwards and throughout the shoeing cycle.)\n\nI’m sure Red has cultivated these less-than-hilarious behaviors with previous farriers throughout his career.\n\n(Since I have no pictures of Red, other chestnut horses in my personal photo archive will have to do :)) DawnHoof\n\nSocial Distancing\n\nSo when Coronavirus mandated “social distancing”, and the fact that Red’s owner is in the emergency health services field — and was therefore forbidden to stand near another human — I got to face off with Red a couple shoeings ago, all by myself.\n\n“I’m not sure I can nail him,” I told his owner. “If I can’t get him nailed, I’ll have to leave him barefoot.”\n\n“He does better in shoes. I hope you can get them on!” Red’s owner said. “Just do the best you can.”\n\n“Would you mind if I treat him like he’s one of my own horses? Do I have your permission to work with Red’s behavior?”\n\n“You sure do!” he said, keeping his distance, hopping in his truck, and driving away.\n\nLeaving me alone with Red, for the first time ever — just the two of us — to work it out on our own.\n\nEnter ~ Romancing Red ~\n\nWonderfully enough, I’d just been working on my post, Romancing the Hoof, so all my new “courtship” and “wooing” strategies were fresh at hand.\n\nPrimed to “love-Red-up” with cookies and rubs and schmoozing, I determined to treat him like he was one of my own horses. With love and firmness, I’d see how far we could get.\n\nBefore starting in, I scratched Red’s neck and whispered soft coos, broke off bits of yummy cookies (The German Horse Muffin, otherwise known as “Horse Crack”), and gave him some delicious bites.\n\nLicking, dropping his head, Red showed all the signs of a happy horse at rest with his herd. That’s what I wanted, “happy-herdship” behavior, rather than displaying “fight-or-flight”.\n\nI started by trimming his hind end, holding his hooves low, using the crook of my foot and the closeness of my stance to support hoof and limb, creating the lowest possible “human hoof stand”. (Horses love this!)\n\nRed responded well. Happy. Relaxed. Agreeable.\n\nI took several breaks, scratching his bum, “Good boy, Red . . .”\n\nRight Fore\n\nFinished with the hinds, I decided to do one front hoof at a time, and to start with his more difficult, right fore.\n\nPulling the shoe — no problem. I rewarded Red with cookies and cooing, “Good boy, Red! Such a good boy!”\n\nSince I knew his difficulty was nailing, and I wasn’t sure if I could get him to cooperate, I took my hammer to his untrimmed bare hoof, and began to very gently tap . . . Red fired into action!\n\nWhap! Pull! Snatch! Red was back into his old fight-or-flight habits.\n\nImmediately I got out from under him, snorted my most demanding “mare snort”, and leapt into aggressive human/horse body-language behavior.\n\nHissing, snorting, baring my teeth, as my own dominant mare would have done to reprimand an upstart — Red knew that I was less than pleased.\n\nHe took a step back, looking peeved.\n\nThen I switched my body language, softening, taking a deep breath — letting it out, blowing my lips to mimic how horses communicate: “It’s all OK . . .”\n\nI asked him to move up, cooing and rubbing, working his endorphin (feel-good hormone) response, until his head lowered and he licked (physical signs of horsey submission).\n\nBack underneath, tapping with my hammer, he jerked again, and we repeated the process a time or two.\n\n‘Ol Red is One Smart ‘Bugga!\n\nRed soon realized he’d rather choose cookies and praises, and make the “mare” (me!) happy — than suffer her snorts and snarls.\n\n“Hurray! Good boy, Red. What a wonderful boy!”\n\nNow I trimmed up the hoof, shaped the shoe, and nailed it on with little incident, generously praising and offering bites of cookies.\n\nYahoo! Nails in, blocked — now ready for clinching.\n\nExtending Red’s hoof onto my stand for rasping and clinching is another behavior he detests — snapping his leg back, turning my stand into an implement of war, aiming at my shins, as if ‘Ol Red is plotting to have the last laugh.\n\nMore “mare snorts” and dominant behavior from me, this time just once, changed clinching from terror to do-able.\n\nHurray! Red was defiantly starting to catch on.\n\nNails clinched, hoof finished, I gave him more cookies and coos, and started in on the left fore.\n\nLeft Fore ~\n\nPull shoe, no problem.\n\nTap bare hoof gently with hammer — Whap! Pull! Snatch! Again, Red worked hard to snap his leg away from me.\n\n(This repeat of behavior is to be expected on the opposite foot, as a horse’s brain must learn on both sides for a lesson to get through to the separate-brain-lobe horse physiology.)\n\nAgain, my good snort and mare-ish hiss ended all that. In a short time, Lovely Red was wearing two new front shoes :))\n\n~~~\n\nFini :))\n\nTo his owner’s delight, Red was happy, sound, shod.\n\nTo my delight, I fell head-over-heels in love with Red, schmoozing and fluffing and flattering him, and feeling his reciprocal energy flowing my way.\n\nNow I know, Red and I can work it out.\n\nNext shoeing, I only had to reinforce his behavior a time or two. And the shoeings after that, he’s stood perfectly and happily for me.\n\nHallelujah Red!\n\nYou’re proof that something good can come out of Covid. The virus might be separating us humans, but it united me deeply with Red :))\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2020\n\nPhotos: Dawn Jenkins; “Aria Laughing” photo by Z.

The more I ride, the more I must ride !” DawnHoof\n\nThe more I ride, the more I experience that effervescent, single-minded, can’t-wait-to-do- it-again, fluttery feeling: Horse High!!!\n\nEnjoy this post I wrote last fall. My wonderful ride on Fae in our woods tonight brought back my Horse High, and I decided to post this now, in honor of all the Great Rides we Horse Humans live for . . . DawnHoof\n\nIt’s the Horse High that keeps me a Horse Girl.\n\nNot just my owning, caring for, and feeding my horses every day . . .\n\nNot just that I can ride.\n\nBut that I do ride!\n\nAgain. And again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nNot a Given . . .\n\nYet sometimes the High alludes me.\n\nOccasionally, rides go bad, or leave me flat.\n\nSometimes it’s tough to get out and ride at all!\n\nBe it weather — too hot, too cold. Conditions — too slick, too much snow. Time — too little daylight, too much work. Or my own energy levels — too tired, or just not quite “up”.\n\nBut most of my Horse Adventures fuel the High I feel today, from all the great rides and carriage drives I’ve experienced recently :)) :)) :))\n\nKeeping Stats :))\n\nYou may not know, but I log every ride! Like in my old days of piloting airplanes, every hour spent in flight, every destination, every landing, recorded in flight logs.\n\nI record my rides in a series of yearly At-A-Glance type organizer books, (going back more than twenty years!), along with my day-to-day work, travel and activities.\n\nRides are circled and flagged, so they stand out and can be tallied. Time, horse(s) and destination, all recorded.\n\nI treasure these records, as they paint the overall picture as to how my Horse Life is playing out, over the larger scope of time.\n\nGoing back through the years and adding up my number of rides and hours spent in the saddle — I’ve noticed, as I’m getting older, the numbers tend to shrink.\n\nYou might be tempted to think, “One day, when things slow down — I’ll live the Life of my Dreams.”\n\nOh, so naive.\n\nYou might find, as you age, you won’t quite have the energy levels you have now.\n\n(Like our vehicles, our own body mileage starts piling up, and we require more maintenance to perform at previous levels of expectation :))\n\n“A good reminder to you younger folks — On with it! Get out and get on with your Dreams! Find a way to manifest the Life you’ve always wanted . . . right now.” DawnHoof\n\nThe Urge to Call it Quits . . .\n\nIn fact, from time to time throughout my more difficult years, when the High has partially alluded me, I’ve actually considered finding a new home for my herd.\n\nThis happened a couple years ago. My rides had gotten less frequent, and some of the thrill had gone.\n\n“If I’m not riding as much, and not enjoying it like before,” I asked, quite seriously . . . “Would my horses be better off with someone else???”\n\nMind Mapping my Solution\n\nSo I did what I always do when faced with a Life Dilemma: I got out felt markers and poster board, and started a fresh Mind Map to explore the topic.\n\nI Rode.\n\nI came home.\n\nI Mapped.\n\nI rode again.\n\nOver the course of a week, I had my answer:\n\nNo, I don’t need to re-home my herd :))\n\nI am an excellent horse owner — but my Life has shifted at this stage, and my horsing must now adjust\n\nSo, rather than find faults, change my expectations and enjoy the phase I’m in now\n\nCreate joy in all that I do with my horses, whether I ride, or not :))\n\nIn shifting my approach, I’m happy to report, my Horse High, which powered the dreams of my childhood, has returned! 🙂 :))\n\nAltering my Expectations\n\nI reset my goals and expectations to include accepting a bit less time in the saddle, yet allowing myself to enjoy this “golden autumn” phase of Life and Horse . . .\n\n(Like the colors and light that grace the fall equinox season.)\n\nFrom my Mapping, I discovered that my Horse High shows up most when I shake up the usual mix :))\n\nHauling and riding somewhere fresh\n\nInviting a friend to join me\n\nMaking some daring change to my everyday routine\n\nRoad Trip!\n\nSo recently, I took action — and loaded Aria and Laddie in the trailer, and headed toward Lockwood Valley.\n\nEarlier this summer I joined an endurance-riding neighbor for a big evening/moonlight ride (4.5 hours!) up Seymour Canyon, an old haunt I hadn’t ridden in years.\n\nNow I set out for an encore ride of just the lower, easy part of Seymour, riding Laddie and ponying Aria.\n\nGolden Seymour Canyon\n\nUp, up we rode.\n\nUp the dirt track.\n\nPast the dried creekbed.\n\nSilhouetted trees.\n\nExposed roots.\n\nMagical Sunbeams :))\n\nA single doe,\n\nLarge eyes and ears,\n\nPaused. Looked —\n\nLeapt off into\n\nThe underbrush —\n\nLaddie’s neck high,\n\nEyes following.\n\nUpward. Onward.\n\nPast ramshackled remains\n\nOf previously inhabited\n\nTrailers and outbuildings.\n\nAbandoned gravel pit.\n\nGrass-lined, dried-out ponds.\n\nThirty-mile vistas.\n\nUp, up, ever up —\n\nWinding past private\n\nFenced-off areas,\n\nAlong the forest line.\n\nOutside the fence,\n\nOutside of time . . .\n\nTo Golden Seymour Flats,\n\nAblaze in once-a-year\n\nPerfect fall glory.\n\nMy saddle warm,\n\nWelcoming.\n\nMy horses eager.\n\nForward. In sync.\n\nMy body fit, fine.\n\nWalking, swinging.\n\nTrotting, loping,\n\nGalloping into freedom —\n\nOne-and-a-half hours\n\nOf constant, fluid motion.\n\nHeading back,\n\nEnd-of-day light.\n\nSatisfied.

In fact it filled our reservoirs, and broke our multi-year drought.\n\nThe ground was saturated for more than two months with snow, ice, mud.\n\nJust when it began warming up, drying out — more rain, snow, mud.\n\nIt SNOWED 4″ in early MAY!!!!\n\nAnd just when my horses hooves were developing their hard, dry soles (a kind of callus which acts like shoe protection for the internal structures and comfort of their hooves) the late snow, saturating the ground, caused those soles to slough — the equivalence losing your shoes on a hot day at the beach . . .\n\nAnd caused those hooves to feel every pebble. Every rock.\n\n~~~~\n\nShoes and Pads to the Rescue\n\nEnter steel Natural Balance horseshoes, leather and Shock Tamer pads, and Sole Pack medicated packing material.\n\nAs a farrier, it’s something I’ve done for other people’s horses for years: Shoe. Pad. Protect.\n\nBut something I’ve rarely needed to do for my own homegrown, four-generation, hardy-hooved herd.\n\nWhy? Because my own healthy-hooved horses really didn’t need it. Barefoot worked fantastic for my horses (other than occasional shoes to help with gait issues or overreaching).\n\n~~~~\n\nSo when we rode the top of our local high-elevation (8,000′-9,000′) Mt. Pinos trails the other evening and FELT the difference — same trails, same horses, we’ve ridden for twenty years — I knew I just had to write.\n\nBecause theory is one thing.\n\nReality is another.\n\n~~~~\n\nEnter Uncle Ink\n\nI agree. Not all horseshoeing is made equal — that’s why I learned to shoe, from my farrier Uncle, Ink Knudson.\n\nI learned to trim my own homebred herd of Arab-cross horses from Uncle Ink in Malibu in 1990.\n\nGreat. Wonderful. Sound. No problems.\n\nBut by 1996, I’d moved up here to the mountains, and got an Arab-Tennessee Walker, named Max, with less than ideal hooves.\n\nAn old barb wire injury to his coronet resulted in a large scar tissue bulb that he would overreach and tear with his hind hoof, causing him head-bobbing lameness.\n\nThe hoof that did grow, came in abnormal.\n\nAbscesses.\n\nHoof soreness.\n\nPoor Max!\n\nThe local farriers up here in our region weren’t able to keep him sound. Even with pads and packing and egg bar shoes.\n\nThat’s when I took him down to Uncle Ink .\n\nAnd Uncle Ink’s shoes made Max sound.\n\nThat’s when I realized, the other farriers couldn’t, wouldn’t do what Uncle Ink did.\n\nI had to learn how to nail on shoes — to help Max. To keep him sound.\n\n~~~~\n\nBad Shoeing is Bad — Good Shoeing is Good!\n\nBut what was it about Ink’s shoes that worked?\n\nWhy couldn’t the local guys have fixed Max and made him comfortable?\n\nWhat did Ink know that the local guys up here didn’t?\n\nThat’s the real secret — the real story.\n\nSteel shoes, alone, aren’t the culprit.\n\nIt’s how the hoof is trimmed, and how those shoes are applied.\n\nAs my Uncle Ink taught me, “It’s art!”\n\nAnd as with all art, it takes a good eye, a good feel, and a good understanding of why you’re doing what it is that you do . . .\n\n~~~~\n\nUncle Ink was a metallurgist in the Navy in WWII. After the war, he went to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo to learn the art of horse shoeing, on the GI Bill.\n\nThen he honed his craft apprenticing with the old Calvary shoers in the LA area.\n\nHe worked with famous veterinarians doing specialized therapeutics. He could make any shoe or support apparatus in his coal forge.\n\nHe shod every kind of horse for every kind of discipline. He shod for every kind of person, including a cadre of famous actors.\n\nHe shod Ronald Reagan’s horses, Roy Roger’s Trigger, Gene Autry’s Champion . . .\n\nAnd he shod my scruffy first horse, Rebel.\n\n~~~~\n\nThe majority of today’s farriers either studied with an elder, or attended one of the farrier schools.\n\nEmphasis seems more on appearance than function.\n\nHow nice the low-nailed clinches appear.\n\nHow straight and level the hoof.\n\n(The old question of balance!)\n\nProblem is, high, angled nails hold better.\n\nHeel nails, now out of fashion, hold the best.\n\nMany hooves are, in themselves, not straight or level. The bones have de-mineralized in accordance to the horse’s conformation.\n\nShoeing those hooves “straight and level” is the same as shoeing a straight and level hoof out of balance.\n\nBut how do you teach this?\n\nHow do these guys learn what it took my Uncle sixty years under the anvil, the forge, the horse, to gain?\n\n~~~~\n\nSo imagine my bliss in discovering, that the skills I originally learned to help Max with his old injury, actually improved my sound, “barefoot” horses on a real-life trail ride into my own local mountainous back country.\n\nSolid hoofbeats. Solid horses.\n\nYahoo!!!!\n\nWe’ve got a great riding schedule planned for this season!!!\n\n~~~~\n\nJoin Dawn for a Soul Horse Ride! Experience the thrill of becoming one with your horse . . .

Along with Disneyland, The Beatles, vinyl discs, Star Trek . . . Jim Morrison’s rifts frozen into the framework of my Baby Boomer’s generation coming of age.\n\nThis song nails it — encapsulating the elation, the freedom, the escape of riding Rebel — from my everyday, junior-high life.\n\nYou know that it will be untrue\n\nYou know that I will be a liar\n\nIf I was to say to you,\n\nGirl, we couldn’t get much higher . . .\n\n~~~\n\nLight My Fire became Rebel and my theme song.\n\nI can’t listen without transporting back to the rhythm of hoof-beats, the feeling of freedom, the smell of chaparral — and hot sweaty horse.\n\nThat, and the GIANT SMILE on my otherwise trying-to-figure-life-out teenage face.\n\n~~~\n\n(From my journal, written the night Laddie came together to really RIDE :))\n\n~~~\n\nLaddie, Light My Fire!\n\nFast forward: Fortysomething years later, Frazier Park, California\n\nThe Scene: Riding my homebred gelding, Laddie, in the woods!\n\nSame rhythm. Same hoofbeats. Same theme . . .\n\nGirl on horseback, experiencing flight. Freedom. Escape from everyday reality into Pegasus’ realm.\n\nGIANT SMILE!\n\nYou see, Laddie came together tonight. And transformed from ‘sticky, green’, to full-blown, Rebel-style Light My Fire!\n\n~~~\n\nHomebred Horse!\n\nWe started riding Laddie May, 2012, as a four year old.\n\nBorn August 22, 2008, I like to wait to start them. Give them time to grow and mature . . .\n\nEspecially being half-Arabian. Especially being part-draft, part-Shire.\n\n(For some reason, the smaller horses and the bigger horses seem to take longer.)\n\nAlthough half-Arabian, Laddie pulled his Grand-Shire’s genes, with Arabian accents. He looks very Welsh Cob: big curvy neck, heavy hindquarters, large high-stepping hooves, complete with feathers.\n\nHe’s the third of my four generations of offspring. And I find him the most interesting!\n\n~~~\n\nTraining Notes\n\nYou see, training horses comes together little by little, in fits and starts.\n\nFrom the time they are born, you move them in the general direction that you wish to accomplish — personable, and mannered, and safe.\n\nYet, by their very nature, horses are cantankerous, and dangerous, and animated.\n\nThey kick and bite and strike. In a word: Wild!\n\nNo healthy young horse I’ve known walks up and allows itself to be haltered — walking perfectly, following.\n\nSome are easier than others, yet, like a Mustang off the range, little foals have to learn all that.\n\n~~~\n\nApply By Layers\n\nMy favorite description of training horses is like applying varnish to wood. It must be done in thin coats, allowed to dry — and sanded between, in order to shine.\n\nYou cannot just dump the stuff on in one session, but must lay it down, layer by layer, building, just so — and stopping at just the right time, to let the lessons sink in . . .\n\nSometimes you make progress. Other times you just back off and give them time to grow.\n\nThe biggest question: Is this horse suited to what I want to use him for? Does he have the build, the mind, the temperament to be safe and fun?\n\nSome individuals, some breeds, fail this requirement. It’s taken me years to work out the mixture, but I’ve got it now, and I treasure it!\n\n~~~\n\nOur Method of Starting Horses\n\nWhen we first take our young horses out into the woods, we let them run along with the group, free. Then, later, on a rope. And then we let them run free again.\n\nIt starts with learning to yield, to submit — to ropes and leadines and people.\n\nBuilding, ever building, on what has been done before — adding weight and saddles, girth and tack.\n\nThey also must learn about trails and footing, trees, rocks and stumps. Barking dogs, speeding cars, loud motorcycles. Gates, mailboxes, dumpsters. Flushing quail, jack rabbits. And a thousand other things that can occur on a ride.\n\nOnce, riding Starboy solo, I heard a massive boom. He spooked in place, dipping, but fortunately not slipping off the steep trail. I thought there must have been a gas explosion from one of the houses below.\n\nTurns out it was the Space Shuttle, Enterprise, coming in for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, a hundred-plus miles from here! The Shuttle broke the sound barrier — right over our heads — and spooked my horse. How do you prepare for something like that???\n\n~~~\n\nFirst Time Up\n\nWe first hop on their backs, unsaddled, in the yard, after they are relaxed from a good workout — one of us standing at his head, helping the other on.\n\nNo stress, no drama.\n\nQuietly up, praising and scratching.\n\nOn and off both sides.\n\nInvariably, they reach around with their neck and sniff and chew at our feet, as if to say, “Hey! What’cha you doing up there Ma???”\n\nLayer by layer.\n\nAll this prep takes place over the first several years.\n\n~~~\n\nFirst Ride!\n\nWhen it’s time for their first real ride, we utilize the herd again. Horses do better in a group than by themselves, so we capitalize on this instinct.\n\nFor his first ride we took Laddie out, running along with us for over an hour, working his exuberant youthful energy down — swift-moving through the woods, up the wash, past the galloping place, to the turn-around . . .\n\nMy brave daughter, Ella, hopped on bareback and rode without a bridle, just a rope halter, for a good forty-five minutes — Lad, flowing along with the group, not at all concerned about having a rider on his back.\n\nInstead of continuing back toward home, we turned up a side trail, now cantering, riding farther away from home so he wouldn’t be in a hurry — again working with his instincts.\n\nThen she hopped off and back onto her horse, letting Lad run home free, with the herd.\n\nThus he learns the A B C’s of carrying a person, and doing our bidding as a trail horse — organically, by degrees.\n\n~~~\n\nSaddled Rides\n\nThe early saddled rides out from the barn can be interesting. The horse can get ‘sticky’ at any point — get confused, and not want to go. Or turn and bolt . . . with a big leap to the side.\n\nYou plan, as best you can, to have everything work in your favor.\n\nCalm day. No wind. No barking dogs or speeding cars or new dumpsters or the like, but even on a country roadway, so much is outside of our control.\n\nMy first saddled ride on Lad involved twilight and a nearly full moon, a dark shoulder-less dirt roadway. All going well — then, surprise! The roar of an engine grinding towards us . . . headlights shifting through the willow trees. Face-to-face with the local septic pumping truck — the Big Rig, no less!\n\nBut because of all we’d put into him, Laddie handled it beautifully. (His mother, Fae was the one who spooked and pranced in place that night!)\n\nAnd Laddie’s come along really well. Strong leader. Retaining what I put into him.\n\nStill a bit spooky and sticky and hesitant and green. But smart and smooth — growing in confidence. And willing . . .\n\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nLaddie, Light My Fire!\n\nSo when Laddie finally gave me his speed, his strength, his willingness to carry me without hesitation tonight (and on a solo ride, no less!) it signaled a milestone. So many years in the making!\n\nAnd I praised him.\n\nAnd I stroked his big neck.\n\nAnd I whooped and hollered for joy!\n\nAnd we flew through the woods, into the realm of Pegasus.\n\nAnd I heard the Doors, and I felt the rhythm:\n\nThe time to hesitate is through\n\nNo time to wallow in the mire\n\nAnd I rose and fell with Laddie’s swift and powerful movement . . .\n\nAnd my eyes watered with the speed.\n\nAnd a GIANT SMILE spread over my now-wiser, horse-satisfied face . . .\n\nCome on Baby light my fire!\n\nTry to set the night on fire . . .\n\nAAAAhhhh! You’re AWESOME, Lad!\n\nHow FANTASTIC is that!!!!\n\n~~~\n\nListen to more of the Doors here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ed9BjZcoXM\n\nPostscript: Laddie continues to mature, AWESOME — turning eight this year.

Meld with her, be ONE with her . . . and with the ride my horse and I take. To learn from the ride, record the ride, ENJOY the ride!\n\nLife Goal: To partner with my Life — my bigger goals, my higher self; to live in harmony with my Life; to unite with, trust, meld with, be ONE with . . . the Ride my Life takes. To learn from the Ride, record the Ride, ENJOY the Ride!\n\n~~~\n\nConstantly Adjust\n\nOne of the strategies required to successfully ride horses, is constantly adjusting my riding seat, my body posture, my hands . . .\n\nFor example, when all goes well:\n\n* My body, my hips, all move with the swaying rhythm of my horse’s back\n\n* My shoulders, my arms and hands, follow that swinging movement\n\n* I hold the reins loosely, my arms outstretched, relaxed, everything flowing in unison . . .\n\n* (And I SMILE :))\n\n~~\n\nYet as my horse carries me, her head, neck, and back forever move — and this movement secretly, silently, pulls the reins — millimeters, centimeters, inches — from my hands.\n\nTherefore, I must constantly adjust my hand position on the reins, or face the fact that my hands become ineffective, and I’ve lost control.\n\n~~~\n\nThe Zone of Contact\n\nThere is an area, out in front of me, where my reins and my hands are effective in stopping, turning, and controlling my horse.\n\nWe’ll call it my “zone of contact”.\n\n~~~\n\nIt’s a sweet place, this zone, where soft, yielding wrists and fingers are forever a slight touch or “feel” away from contacting my horse’s mouth — my horse’s mind, that which controls the drive-train, if you will . . .\n\nWith my soft hands in this zone, my horse feels free to move forward, unhindered by me — which is what I want.\n\nI want to bring out the very best in her, for the best partnership and cooperation, the most unity and enjoyment.\n\n~~~\n\nIf I hold my hands too much in front of this zone, my reins too short — I choke my horse’s ability to move.\n\nToo much behind, my reins too long — a big gap exists, making me unable to seamlessly control my horse’s tempo, direction and speed.\n\nIf I hold my hands outside of the zone, my movements will be jerky, rough. She will resist me. Resent me. Our smooth partnership aborts.\n\n~~~\n\nTherefore, the need to constantly adjust . . . which an experienced rider does without thought.\n\nThe horse’s movements pull the reins — the rider adjusts — the reins pull — the rider adjusts . . .\n\nAnd so it goes, like a tennis player adjusting her racket, a surfer shifting the angle of his body on his board, a skier setting the edges, cutting into the icy slope.\n\n~~~\n\nRide Life!\n\nNow what does this have to do with the Ride we call Life?\n\nLife Goal: To partner with my Life — my bigger goals, my higher self; to live in harmony, in peace, with my Life; to unite with, trust, meld with, be ONE with . . . the Ride my Life takes. To learn from the Ride, record the Ride, ENJOY the Ride!\n\n~~~\n\nLike our horse, Life is constantly moving, changing.\n\nAnd like my horse, Life’s-forever-movement secretly, silently, pulls the reins — the safety zone, the control — from my hands. Millimeters, centimeters, inches, at a time.\n\nBut how do I adjust my hand position on Life’s reins? Or face the fact that my hands have become ineffective, and I’ve lost control!\n\nWhere is my “Zone of Contact”, and how do I Ride Life ? ? ?\n\n~~~\n\nThe Zone of Contact\n\nLet’s look at where Life’s Zone of Contact isn’t.\n\n* It isn’t found in freaking out.\n\n* It isn’t found in clutching tight.\n\n* It isn’t found in closing my eyes, holding my breath and “hoping for the best” any more than riding my horse would succeed with that approach . . .\n\n~~~\n\nLife’s Zone of Contact is a sweet place where soft, yielding thoughts and aspirations are forever a slight touch or “feel” away from my Life’s purpose, motivation — that which controls the drive-train, if you will. That which keeps me connected and on the very Ride . . .\n\nWith my soft, yielding thoughts in this zone, my Life freely moves forward, unhindered by me — which is what I want.\n\nI want to bring out the very best in my Life, the best Partnership and Cooperation, the most Unity and Enjoyment.\n\n~~~\n\nIf I hold my thoughts — my actions ­­– fearfully, too much in front of this Zone, I choke my Life’s ability to move.\n\nLackadaisically, my thoughts and actions too much behind, a big gap exists, making me unable to steer my Life’s tempo, direction and speed.\n\nWhen I live Life outside of the Zone, my movements are jerky, rough. My higher self resents me. Resists me. Our smooth partnership aborts.\n\n~~~\n\nConstantly Adjust\n\nTherefore, the need to constantly adjust . . . which an experienced Life-Rider does without pause . . .\n\nLife’s movements pull the reins — the Rider’s thoughts and actions adjust — Life pulls — the Rider, again, adjusts . . .\n\nAnd so it goes, when fear and resistance attempt to pull against us — we adjust, yielding — loosening thoughts, embracing goodness — taking action . . .\n\n~ Toward love. And trust. ~\n\n~ Toward harmony. And peace. ~\n\n~ Toward my bigger goals, my higher self. Again. ~\n\n~~~\n\nAnd so I’m reminded to Ride Life, like I ride my horse — on meandering trails and wild-paced gallops — just for sheer joy and pleasure!\n\nAnd it’s true!\n\nI’m often amazed at the similarities between successfully riding and controlling my thousand-plus-pound-horses . . .\n\nAnd Navigating the Potentially Out-of-Control Ride we all call Life.\n\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nCopyright 2015\n\nPhotos: DawnHoof (Dawn Jenkins)\n\n~~~~\n\nLike what you’ve read here?

Born in Malibu, I remember so well . . . and still he’s healthy, sound — ready to fly like a Piper Warrior, into the woods at endurance speed — and enjoy!\n\nIn tribute to Starboy, here’s a jovial piece from my journal, written December, 2012.\n\n~~~\n\nMy Horse: My Airplane\n\nMy horse is an airplane, my airplane, and my soul longs to take up his yoke and soar.\n\nAs I roll open the gate and lead him from his barn-hanger, I feel the thrill of knowing that we’ll be in the air, soon.\n\nLike my fellow aviators, I administer my preflight routine: Brush off his hair coat—check. Pick out his hooves—check. Pad, saddle, girth, bridle—check, check, check.\n\n~~~\n\nBefore I mount, I run my hand across his silky neck, and I remember my dad’s first airplane, when I was very young. After all, it was a horse – an airplane called a Piper Colt — a tiny economical two-seater with not metal, but a painted cloth exterior.\n\nI remember Dad being extra careful in his preflight check to be sure there were no scrapes or tears in the thing. (Fortunately, there never were.)\n\nDad told my brother and me, “Don’t touch the skin – it’s thin as paper! You could poke your finger through it by mistake!”\n\nGee, Dad, I thought. How safe is that?\n\n~~~\n\nFortunately my plane is made of proper flesh – no paint-coated cloth cut-outs for me.\n\nI stand back and admire how he looks: Sturdy sleek lines, aerodynamic contours, built to take on the task at hand.\n\nMy open air, VariEze-Berkut-Lear-Jet experimental model (Starboy) is ready to take me into the skies!\n\nI climb up onto his fuselage, clamor into his cockpit. Secure.\n\nWe idle out of the ranch, down the taxiway, ready to accelerate, to elevate, to leave earth’s gravity and experience the weightless thrill of unfettered flight.\n\nVariEze experimental aircraft designed by Burt Rutan.\n\nPhoto Credit: Wikipedia: By Stephen Kearney (Personal collection.)\n\n~~~\n\nOnce in the forest, I ease in the throttle – and we’re air-born – just like that! How effortlessly he melds with the winds aloft, soaring up the trail.\n\nSensitive, responsive, like the best-made craft, my horse climbs, hooves churning, pouring on the power, heaving forth into the great expanse.\n\nHis silken mane flaps with the currents, his hooves kick up dust-particle-vortices – beware traffic following too close behind!\n\nGliding, soaring, we yaw, pitch, and roll our way through the cool-air, wooded-wonderland, my face smiling in delight – whooping out loud, praising Starboy, awakening the little girl in me who always loves to fly.\n\nI remember seeing houses, all the rows of houses and driveways and cars and swimming pools, and how small they looked from above.\n\nI remember falling asleep in the back of Dad’s next, bigger airplane, his Beechcraft Bonanza, on the way home from Disneyland – at 2am – where Dad worked as Bandleader at the Park.\n\n(Listen to Dad’s Disneyland music here: Elliott Brothers Orchestra at Disneyland — Read more about Dad here: You Can Do Anything and Family of Flying.)\n\nI remember half-awaking to the lullaby sound of the engine, feeling the bumps and swoops of flight, the plane gently caressing me — Dad in the cockpit, a serene look on his face — the small red light, and the glow of the instrument panel illuminating his profile.\n\nI hear the sounds of the radio, static, clicking in and out, and the voice of Dad’s nightly Air Traffic Controller friend at the LAX tower, “How’s it going up there, Mickey Mouse?”\n\n~~~\n\nI dodge a tree branch before it snaps me in the face, Starboy soaring, sailing his way upward.\n\nThe forest footing feels damp today, boggy in places, snow patches here and there. Not to fear. Acrobatic maneuvers are Starboy’s specialty!\n\nHe dances and darts to firmer ground, wiggles his wings, loops the loop and skillfully applies the laws of aerodynamics in his own horsey way.\n\nWe barnstorm the woods like a Curtis Jenny with it’s Hispano-Suiza engine my Grandfather told of from his 1918 days in the Army Air Service, WWI.\n\nI remember pouring through Grandfather’s vintage monotone photographs, held into the book by little black paste-on corners. His six-foot-tall frame looked small next to the massive cowling, props, and engine of the planes he flew and worked on as mechanic.\n\nOne day, after I started flying, Grandfather explained his favorite acrobatic maneuver, the Chandelle – think Flex-Straw.\n\nHe thrust his now-aged hand above him into a steep climb – steel-blue eyes following – rotating into an upward U-turn, doubling back and continuing on – smiling now, just a bit – re-living the thrills of his earlier adventures, before career and kids and life set in . . .\n\nI took Grandfather flying just once, about two years after I’d gotten my pilot license – out of Santa Monica. He hadn’t been in a small plane since Dad had passed, a decade before.\n\nI grabbed his wiry eightysomething arm and helped him into the cockpit next to me, where he sat stoic, looking out at the mountains, and homes, and landscapes below. (I remember the feeling of intense responsibility in piloting him, and great relief in returning him, unharmed, to Terra firma.)\n\nBefore he died, he gave me his log book, documenting fifty hours of flight training, as well as his original leather military flight helmet, faded and tattered by time. (Which, when I tried it on my head, fit, perfectly!)\n\n~~~\n\nStarboy’s reins feel warm in my gloved hands, transmitting soft contact through rudder and aileron, saddle and leg. No extra right rudder needed to offset this engine torque! Coordinated turns, perfect bank, my airplane’s motion satisfies my soul with fine-tuned grandeur.\n\nAnd I realize how fortunate I am – how very few who set out to be pilots, very few who endeavor to be horsemen, really master the art, melding as one with their craft.\n\nAnd I recall my own years of flight over these very mountains, alone at the controls of my rented Cherokee Warrior aircraft.\n\nI remember well one crisp winter day, smiling, singing, weaving above ridgelines and canyons dusted in sugar-coated snow – songs of Judy Collins playing on my at-the-time high-tech Sony Walkman.\n\nRows and flows of angel hair\n\nAnd ice cream castles in the air\n\nAnd feathered canyons everywhere,\n\nI’ve looked at clouds that way…\n\nWe turn onto a spur trail now, a shortcut toward home. Starboy’s neck stretches, his engine begs more RPM’s. I hold him back – I’m the pilot, he’s the craft. No runaway-out-of-control tailspins for us!\n\nAs we rise and fall with the updrafts, the forest smells beautiful today. Early winter silver boughs sparkle in the late-day sun. It’s a perfect flight on Starboy, doing what we love best…\n\nAnd I remember my life back then, twentysomething entrepreneur, grabbing onto the yoke of life, the Fashion Industry’s fickle trends dictating my every move.\n\nSales, manufacturing, Boutique shows, employees. And yet all I really wanted was to find a way to make a living with horses. To ride – and fly – and soar into dimensions of the soul…\n\n~~~\n\nI never tire of the energy, the spectacle, the lightness of flight. How it lifts me out of my earthly doldrums and whisks me into whimsy. And now, here on Starboy, flying home. Satisfied.\n\nMid-life Dawn winks an eye at her former self, knowing that I’m flying again, like I always have. Cherishing my well-tuned craft and his subtle response to my slightest cues. Just the way it should be.\n\nI’ve looked at life from both sides now,\n\nFrom here and there and still somehow\n\nWith life’s illusions I recall\n\nI really don’t know life, at all…\n\nTurning base, descending for our landing now, I see the houses of our valley – like the houses from the airplanes of my youth. And I smile. Big!\n\nBecause I’ve looked at life from both sides now, lived life from both sides – up in the air, and down on the forested earth. And I’m here, flying Starboy right now – just where I most like to be.\n\nWe touch down at the forest gate – soft, smooth. Then taxi the final stretch to our glider’s home port.\n\nStarboy whinnies, deeply, to the other members of his herd, who answer in shrill reply.\n\nBut instead of refueling with Avgas, my Bonanza-Warrior-Hispano-Suiza-Starboy dines tonight – on alfalfa hay!\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2012, 2015\n\n~~~~\n\nLike what you’ve read here?

Reading it, I smile . . .\n\nAria turned eight last month — and indeed, she’s coming together — just lovely!\n\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nYesterday Aria came completely together for me!\n\nIn that one ride she transformed from green, still-being-worked-on horse-in-training, to polished riding gem!\n\nIt makes me remember the time when that happened with her mother, Fae — in Shadow Hills, exploring the mountains behind Hai Mitchell’s carriage driving facility.\n\nFae had been there in training for a couple of months, working in harness several times weekly, and in stunning physical condition.\n\nAnd while out riding the hills that day, she graced me with one of the rides of my life.\n\nI remember it distinctly . . . time stood still.\n\nSuddenly I was re-living the rides of my childhood, my early adulthood, when the kids were young. Fae became a composite of all the horses — real and fantasy — in my life before her.\n\nIt took her nine years, yet that day, Fae’s brain and body came together — no longer gangly half-draft (Shire), struggling to sort it all out — but now polished, responsive.\n\nAble to balance her own body, and along with it, balance and carry mine.\n\nFinally ready to really ride and enjoy.\n\n~~~\n\nYesterday, Aria did the same!\n\nIt takes such a long time for a horse to mature.\n\nYou breed them, birth them. Halter them, wean them. Nurture them, train them.\n\nYou feed, and spend — and wait for them to grow. Thinking, hoping, that you know what kind of horse they might be — but not really.\n\nBecause, like a little kid, they have so much to to go through.\n\nAnd there’s so much that can go awry . . . it’s not a given that all turns out as you wish . . .\n\nIt takes years of training, painted on in thin layers, each ride and experience building upon those before.\n\nThere’s a thrill in that, but the ultimate goal is a seasoned riding horse, whose mind and hooves meld with her rider.\n\nAnd you can’t push it. Like a blossom, it opens fully in its own time.\n\n~~~\n\nSo yesterday, Aria gave me glassy perfection!\n\nI re-live it now, with wonder.\n\nI had worked her down the day before, ponying her off of Starboy in a swift loop from the Snow Gate to the “Y”.\n\nNow, ponying Laddie along until we enter the woods, I let him off the rope, running free.\n\nFrom the beginning, Aria responds immediately, softly, to my lightest signals — my body never coming off her back unless posting.\n\nHer legs, now my legs. Her body, my body.\n\nMelded, married, swiftly moving forward.\n\nFluid, flying, outside of the day-to-day realm.\n\nEndurance! Speed! Exuberance in motion!\n\nWe transit the forest to the sand wash, up Mill Canyon, running the galloping stretch neck-to-neck with Laddie, still loose off the lead.\n\n(Several times, he enjoys positioning himself directly in front of us, deliberately blocking our progress, slowing the pace — Aria’s head shaking in protest with snarly looks and pressed back ears . . . )\n\n~~~\n\nTurning back, returning toward home on the “Sneaky Trail,” Aria amps into overdrive, turning up her speed — seeking out the twisting, single-track rut — taking the turns, loops, and swirls like a Disneyland adventure ride!\n\nIn a flash I’m back in my childhood: Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride, The Tea Cups, The Matterhorn, Peter Pan . . .\n\nIn her never-ending movement I re-live the Roller Coaster at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, lilting smile upon my face.\n\nSpinning ’round a scrub oak, dodging a thick pinon branch, we sprint up the rise and dip down the back side, in endless loose-reined flight, Laddie following a few lengths behind us.\n\nNow, I feel the spinning, swirling Airplane Ride at Pacific Ocean Park on the end of the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nLaughing, marveling, as Aria’s hooves soar above the ground — I find myself flying my early-twenty’s airplane, my acrobatic glider, my childhood fantasy Pegasus . . .\n\nOh, to meld with a horse like this!\n\nOn her, I body-surf waves, slalom moguls, and pilot my fighter jet, surpassing supersonic speeds!\n\n~~~\n\nAnd I realize that this ride marks the fulfillment of my dreams and fantasies, not just for her, but for all the horses in my life. Deep-seated childhood dreams . . .\n\nI want to have horses.\n\nI want to raise horses.\n\nFrom babies, from foals.\n\nI want to ride horses on endless trails —\n\nthat’s what I want in my life.\n\n~~~\n\nAnd I take a moment and remember all that Aria, my third-generation home-bred mare, and I have been through to get this far:\n\n* The morning, as a newborn, she scrapped to stand on straggly legs.\n\n* Hauling her to the Vet hospital — numerous times — to nurse her wounds and afflictions.\n\n(I remember the evening, as a four-month-old, both veterinarians wanted to put her down, right then — her knee shattered and broken. But she pulled through, she recovered! Not just that, but her hind leg kicked, and resulting surgery, massive vet bills, aftercare. And last year, to the hospital, again.)\n\n* When Ella and I rode her on those the first few rides, reveling in her smooth gaits, her calm, confident demeanor. Deciding that she is exactly the horse one wants to replicate — thus breeding her for filly, Hokuleia, and then, Fae again, for little brother, Noir, to preserve her bloodlines . . .\n\n* Training, nurturing, feeding, board, care . . . all that goes in to breeding and raising and bringing up a horse like this.\n\nAnd I realize that it’s taken seven full years, and then some — for her to come together! Finally now mature. Reliable. Ready for our endless future adventures.\n\n~~~\n\nLast year, one of the teenage kids at the riding program Aria went to for training commented, “Someday, I want to have a horse like this!”\n\nMy reply: “You cannot buy a horse like Aria — no one will sell them. You have to make one!”\n\nI’m beaming right now with the accomplishment! :))\n\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nCopyright 2015\n\n~~~\n\nRead more about Aria here: Aria, My Pegasus\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’ve been tracking this theme for several years now, wondering what it is about grown-up life that loses spontaneity?\n\nI want to get out and ride my horse, but something seems to get in my way . . .\n\nSo I hopped on tonight for an impromptu Ride for Little Dawn – and it was fabulous! Here’s the concept, written a few years back, in August, during the peak of summer riding season.\n\n~~~\n\nChanging seasons bring changing moods. Riding is different for me now.\n\nYears ago, I lived to ride. I fantasized myself forever riding my childhood horse, Rebel, especially while stuck sitting alone during lunchtime at Emerson Junior High.\n\nLittle Dawn loved horses more than life itself.\n\nBut Mid-life Dawn, during precious time off from work, gets tired, wants to hang out at home. And there are so many errands and things to do . . .\n\nI’ve always been a trail rider, an endurance rider. And these kinds of rides take energy – especially now that the kids have moved out and I’m riding alone again.\n\nBut I promised Little Dawn that she would ride later . . .\n\nAfter the children were grown.\n\nAfter the bills were paid.\n\nAfter the horses were raised and trained.\n\nI gave her many excuses.\n\nAnd now I find myself with internal battle.\n\nI put off riding on Saturday because I was just too pooped. Now it’s Sunday.\n\nDo I honor Little Dawn and take her riding, even if I’d rather be doing something else? What resistance stops me from getting out and enjoying the horses I’ve worked so hard for?\n\n~~~\n\nAfter writing this journal entry and defining my quandary, I made my move.\n\nThe last two nights I got off my butt and rode. For her . . .\n\n~~~\n\nSunday I saddled Starboy and ponied Mentor, leaving late, at 6:30 p.m. We pulled the grade to McGill trail, climbing the switchbacks into the wilderness up the side of grand Mt. Pinos, our mountain neighbor and protector, standing 8,800’ above sea level.\n\nSounds fantastic, doesn’t it?\n\nI made my sad self rally.\n\nI got out, I rode . . .\n\nThen why was I still so tired?\n\nWhy did riding feel like drudgery and work? Commitment, not exuberance? Prodding Starboy to keep a steady trot up the trail.\n\n~~~\n\nThen, somewhere up the switchback section, Little Dawn showed up — and the work gave way to adventure!\n\nThere on the hillside next to me, The Shadow appeared. The same Shadow of old. The one Little Dawn loved to watch. The only witness to her childhood rides.\n\nAnd there was Little Dawn in The Shadow, bathed in milky late-day light.\n\nRiding her beautiful horse again.\n\n~~~\n\nShe looked young, athletic, fit.\n\nHer arms were muscled and strong.\n\nShe even wore her hat, like days of old.\n\nShe got very excited at seeing her image again, and I, too, got inspired to be up on Mt. Pinos, riding my wonderful horses, in the finale of a perfect summer day.\n\n~~~\n\nLittle Dawn thanked me for honoring her, for taking her riding even when I didn’t feel like it.\n\nAnd I stopped and wrote a poem about her, and The Shadow, and the horses. (I had paper and pen in my saddlebag, a first!)\n\nAnd then we talked, sitting on the horse, right up there on the side of the mountain.\n\nShe spilled out her heart — how she’s waited and been patient and grown-up as possible . . . but really, she never got her turn. And she’s been waiting for me to SLOW DOWN and to listen to her!\n\nTo honor her — and not just my day-to-day concerns.\n\nAnd I agreed. And we discovered a new commonality, based around the horses, and Nature, and spontaneity — and we made a new commitment to one another, right then and there . . .\n\n~~~\n\nLittle Dawn loved the ride so much, and was so enthused, she talked me out of turning around when the sun’s light set, and we persevered on, into the now deepening twilight — two more miles to the lookout above the meadow.\n\nAs per our custom, we dismounted at the lookout and a ‘bar tender’ (that would be me) thoughtfully served up carrots (from our saddle bag) for the patrons (Starboy and Mentor), who showed greedy appreciation with soft busy noses . . .\n\nNow, with the horses rested and happy, we turned to ride back down the single-track, side-of-the-mountain trail, engulfed in complete pitch-black-under-the-trees-darkness — no moon tonight.\n\n(We didn’t get back to the ranch until 10:30.)\n\nBut even though it was dark, and at times a bit unnerving, Little Dawn didn’t fret. Even when Starboy went off-trail in the blackness!\n\nShe just corrected his path and began singing camp songs, and Beatles songs, and nursery songs, and gospel songs, and Big Band songs . . . until we were out of the four-miles of tree-shrouded darkness and back in the open valley again, under the bright canopy of stars.\n\nThe ride was so exhilarating, I couldn’t wait to go again! My body didn’t even hurt the next day.\n\n~~~\n\nSo last night Little Dawn and I rode Angel and ponied Sage. We started out at our favorite end-of-day time. I wanted to go back up McGill, but kept seeing a mental picture of riding South toward Plunderosa, so that was where we went.\n\nWe zipped through the forest, flew through the wash — Angel moving out happily, steadily, in a big-strided ground-covering trot — Sage following along perfectly, like a choreographed dance partner, not at all pulling on my arm.\n\nTwo hours of mounted bliss.\n\n~~~\n\nLittle Dawn loved it, and so did I.\n\nShe’s still talking about it today — and planning another ride for later.\n\nIt sure is great to have her back in my life!\n\n~~~\n\n(We ended up hauling to Malibu and riding two more days — making four back-to-back rides in a row! How’s that for transformation?)\n\n~~~\n\nSo whenever I haven’t ridden enough, whenever the cares of life seem to get in the way, I think of Little Dawn, find the time to saddle up my horse, take off into the woods — and ride!\n\n~~~\n\nCopyright 2006, 2014\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAh, the joys of new life!\n\nFae’s latest accomplishment, Red Star Noir, came into this world on August 19, 2014 — and as I now count, he’s my eleventh new baby foal!!!\n\nMy newborn foals:\n\n1 – AA Mentor – 1985\n\n2 – Mentor’s Jewel – 1989\n\n3 – Starboy – 1990\n\n4 – Angel -1991\n\n5 – Fanta’s Sir Prize – 1995\n\n6 – Fanta’s Fae Dancer (aka Fanta’s Dancing Fae ) – 2001\n\n7 – Maverick – 2007\n\n8 – Aria – 2007\n\n9 – Laddie (Aladdin’s Bay Star) 2008\n\n10 – Hokuleia – 2012\n\n11 – Red Star Noir – 2014\n\n~~~~\n\nI remember as a kid, some time during junior high, the horse calendar that hung in my room. One month there was a picture of an adorable bay-colored Arabian colt, perhaps just two weeks old.\n\nI remember looking and wishing and marveling at the beauty of his fresh life. I wondered what it would be like to hold him, pet him. Raise him, love him. And I decided: SOMEDAY, I’ll have a baby horse of my own!\n\nI remember wondering: Would I really? How? How could that be possible?\n\nBut I tucked that wish away, along with my life-long desire to have, ride and love a horse of my very own.\n\nAnd I went back to living my junior high life. Not knowing if either of those dreams would EVER come true.\n\n~~~~\n\nThen, completely out of the blue one day, Mom made the announcement, driving alone with her in the car. (I remember it oh so well. I was thirteen.)\n\nHer voice cracked a little, and she said: “Dad and I have decided to get you a horse.”\n\nWhat? Really? After all these years of begging??? Wahoooo!!! This is my dream come true!\n\nI ended up with a scruffy unregistered strawberry roan, Heinz 57-Appaloosa/Arab mix named Rebel. Said to be seven years old, he’d been a family’s “trail horse”. He had a long nose, beautiful eyes and a swinging black tail.\n\nRebel was the perfect first horse for me. Rugged, rank — he challenged my limited skills and fulfilled my endless horse-addiction.\n\nHe became the focal point of my existence.\n\nRebel got me through the tough times, the lonely times, of junior high and high school. I LIVED for riding Rebel.\n\nThrough him I experienced freedom. Riding, flying, through the wilderness on wings of horsey joy. (See: Laddie, Light my Fire)\n\n~~~~\n\nThen, when I was sixteen, Dad passed away from a heart attack — changing EVERYTHING in my life — one fateful night.\n\n“Honey, things are always changing. The sooner you get used to that, the better off you’ll be.” (See: Cha-Cha-Changes!)\n\nDid Dad know something when he told me those words, just weeks before he suddenly passed?\n\nAgain, Rebel was my constant. My confidant. My outlet. My sanity. He was my freedom on four fabulously swift legs.\n\nAnd I turned to him even more after losing Dad.\n\nWe would ride the Southern California mountain trails all day, every Saturday, The Doors singing “Come on baby light my fire . . .” from the transistor radio strapped to my saddle. Grit in my teeth, smile on my face, on and on and on, as far as we could go.\n\nYet after finishing high school, I began wondering about the reason for life.\n\nWhat am I to do with my life? Why are we here? Where do we go after we leave this green Earth? Where is Dad now?\n\nI dropped out of University and did what I’d often dreamed I’d do. I rode Rebel into the California wilderness on a ten-day, soul-searching, solo trek. Just me and Rebel.\n\nAlone.\n\n~~~~\n\nMy time alone in the wilderness toughened my determination. I overcame many obstacles, completing my “hero’s quest”, and I came back into civilization with new resolve.\n\nI will live my life to the fullest. I will live as close to Nature as possible. I will pursue all my dreams!\n\nFollowing my love for horses and animals, I worked teaching horseback riding, then milking cows on commercial dairy farms.\n\nI chopped down trees, sewed canvass, built a Sioux Indian Tipi — and lived in it — as close to Nature as I could be!\n\nRebel lived outside the Tipi in the pasture with me, only a sheet of canvass between us.\n\nThose were awesome times, living on the Earth, literally! With horses and cattle surrounding me. Until, eventually, Rebel aged and passed away.\n\nAfterwards I had a brief stint with another horse, an Arabian mare I called Stargirl. But she met with tragedy, and I was horseless for a number of my mid-twenties years.\n\nEventually I went back to college, learned to fly airplanes, and started my own fashion business.\n\n(See: Entrepreneur — Lessons Learned over 40 years)\n\n~~~~\n\nNow, I was in position to own a horse again!\n\nSo in 1980, I bought an Appaloosa yearling mare, named Fanta (Smokey Joe’s Fanta).\n\nLittle did I know when I was outbid on the original mare I’d come to buy at auction that day, that the understated roan filly I ended up purchasing would continue her legacy in my life — some three decades later!\n\n(I definitely ended up with the better horse!)\n\nFanta’s combination of Appaloosa, Running Quarter Horse, Racing Thoroughbred, and (1/4th) Arabian gave her speed, endurance and silky-smooth gaits.\n\nHer BIG trot, bounding canter, and animated walk made her a pleasure to ride.\n\nAfter deciding to train her myself, and spending the next several years researching and accomplishing the task, I also ended up purchasing a purebred (in-foal) Arabian mare who soon gave birth to a beautiful, intelligent bay colt: AA Mentor.\n\nI got my baby horse after all!\n\nUnder the lamplight, in the sweet smell of straw, breathing his fresh newborn scent, my baby horse dreams came true. Singing, cooing, rubbing his soft fur, I’d whisper of how we’d ride together, fly together — him carrying me, into the mountains, by the sea, over endless rolling hills . . . the wind rushing through our hair.\n\nHolding him in my lap, Mentor filled my heart with not just love, but fresh purpose and perspective. Here was new life for a new future. A new portal to magical adventures ahead!\n\nAlthough Fanta was six when Mentor was born, it was love at first whinny — and despite their difference in age, they became life-long mates.\n\n~~~~\n\nSoon after Mentor’s birth, my life went through big changes. I, too, gave birth to my own baby girl, and then another . . .\n\nAnd Fanta gave birth to Mentor’s babies, and she and I ended up raising our offspring together — horses and humans bonded like siblings.\n\nI got another Tipi, living again on the Earth, with my babies, with my horses — even Nubian milk goats. Once again, close to Nature.\n\nCompletely magical!\n\nLittle kids and little baby horses romping, bucking, playing dress-up — inventing their own language, games, rules. My kids and Fanta’s — exploring life. Growing up side-by-side.\n\nEventually my kids grew taller, the horses matured, and we’d all ride together — wild rides through the wilderness. Horses and humans of the same herd — bonded, it would turn out, for generations yet unborn . . .\n\n(See: The Vast, Great Sea of Horses)\n\n~~~~\n\nSo now, long after my kids have moved out, long after Fanta and Mentor have passed — a new life enters my herd: Red Star Noir!\n\nAnd get this — the timing, the beyond-coincidence planning of the Cosmos — born just three days after my first grandchild was born. :))\n\nOh Fanta, you and I, raising babies together again!\n\nThis one, yet another grand-colt. Born within days of my grand-daughter.\n\nAnd we welcome you, Star Noir, to our family. To our herd.\n\nAnd now, once again, I snuggle you. I breathe in your fresh baby scent . . . rub your fur, scratch your favorite itch spots. And I whisper sweet images of us riding together, flying together — you carrying me, like Fanta and Mentor before.\n\n~~~~\n\n~~~~\n\nUpdate on Noir\n\nSadly, Noir didn’t reach his second birthday.\n\nSometimes, horses live and thrive and excel. Others fail to come to fruition, or run into difficulties beyond which we can deal.\n\nIt’s part of Life. Part of owning, breeding and raising horses. And I’ve learned to be OK with it. (See my post, One-Third ~ Two-Thirds (the Good and the Bad.)\n\nOne thing I know — happy, free — Noir joins the ranks of herd and family-mates on the Other Side of the Rainbow.\n\nWhere the grass is always green.\n\nWhere there are no fences or limitations.\n\nWhere the exuberance of Life continually flows.\n\nGalloping. Free. Unhindered.\n\nAmen!\n\nMay God bless Red Star Noir :))\n\nDawnHoof\n\n(June 2019)\n\n~~~~\n\nCopyright 2014, 2019\n\n~~~\n\nJoin Dawn for a Soul Horse Ride!

Sometimes a horse must be determined to be unsafe or unusable.\n\nBut MOST of the time — Two-Thirds of the time, everything works out beautifully. :))\n\nSo you know what I’ve learned to do?\n\n(I’m repeating it here, as much for me to remember, as for you to hear!)\n\nI’ve learned to get over the worry, get through the bummer as best as possible — as if it were a test — bless the One Third, and move on.\n\nBecause without the One-Third, I would never have the Two-Thirds — the beauty, wonder and perfection my horses bring my family and me.\n\n(Like the photos, above and below, from last fall of my daughter, Ella, enjoying our horses. :))\n\n~~~\n\nBut this summer presents a different picture.\n\nLately, it seems the One-Third has been busy at work.\n\nA mare with a blown leg, a large hospital bill. Another horse with an inflamed eye.\n\nOh, I can feel sorry for myself.\n\nBut I’d rather feel grateful that the leg has quieted — the mare will heal!\n\nThe eye has toned down.\n\nI’ve found it better to focus on the Perfect Two-Thirds, and do what I need to do to get through the Flawed One-Third, than to worry and drive myself nuts!\n\n~~~\n\nSo when horsing (or life) seems to go South on you, when bad things happen to good people, good horses — take a deep breath.\n\nAsk: What do I need to do now?\n\nAnd DEAL with it, the best you know how.\n\nTake your lump and get over it.\n\nAnd focus on the goodness.\n\nAnd be grateful for all the perfect rides.\n\nAnd consider the time you spend nursing a sick horse as bonding time with your beloved.\n\nAnd know that, in time, as long as you stick with your positive horsing program — the Two-Thirds shall prevail.\n\nAnd yes, you will be riding again.\n\nAnd laughing!\n\nAnd loving your horse, in all her soundness!\n\n~~~\n\nAnd if you discover that you do have the wrong mount, if all that’s associated with a certain individual seems to ALWAYS go South . . . determine when to cut your losses — search for the horse that will better serve your needs.\n\nAnd move on into the glory of horsemanship you envisioned from the start.\n\n~~~\n\n~~~\n\nCopyright 2014\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHorses and riding have always allured me, and the intellectual side of myself has, from time to time, tried to figure out — Why?\n\nWhat calls my Soul to horses? Why is it that nothing else will quite do?\n\nJoin me on my quest to discover what it is, and why, us horse people must ride.\n\n~~~\n\nCalifornia: Pacific Crest Trail, off Liebre Mountain — Springtime, 2002.\n\nBuckeyes are just beginning to pop with small brilliant lime-green ‘palm trees’ bursting out at the end of the branches.\n\nThe tree we pass now is overgrown and grabbing for my face; I duck hurriedly and just miss it.\n\nNow we glide past gooseberries with stalks of shiny green leaves and delicate red florets. Now more buckeyes. Now a grove of clustered, densely-packed oaks with textured gray bark and bluish leaves.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places, a steep incline at the Northern reaches of the Angeles National forest, above the vast Mojave Desert and the great Tejon Ranch.\n\nTime stands still on this edge of forest rim, except for the constant changing drama of the seasons.\n\n~~~\n\nNow, we approach the ‘digger pine’ forest — eerie enough to also be known as ‘ghost pine’ — so thickly wooded you’d think someone had planted it.\n\nBut nature herself did, decades ago, when the first football-sized, sap-laden cone scattered its seed and took root here.\n\nUsually solitary sentinels on a north-facing ravine, this grove is most unusual.\n\nThe lighting changes under the labyrinth of the trees"
