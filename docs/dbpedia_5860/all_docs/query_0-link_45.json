        "text": "Creating a care plan\n\nCreating a care plan helps us collect as much information as we can about how an owner cared for their horses. For instance, Horse & Halo cares for a gelding who displays extreme reactivity when he sees a UPS truck—probably not the best time to ride. One may be surprised where UPS trucks show up. As a caregiver, it was helpful to have this information in order to set the horse up for success, especially while being ridden by novice riders.\n\nFred and Georgia’s story\n\nThe hay supplier for Horse & Halo asked us to consider visiting these two horses whose owners had recently passed away. Upon arrival, our team thought we must be at the wrong location, considering that the horses appeared to be the height of a standard pony from a distance. As we approached the horses’ enclosures, we quickly realized these horses were in crisis. They had worn a path along the fence line deep enough to mistake their 18-plus hh for the average pony. Both horses exhibited a body score of less than 3, had open sores, and a handful of other ailments. Their owner had fallen ill and enlisted a close friend to care for her horses over the past year. Fred is a very large Clydesdale, and Georgia is the most beautiful Shire I’ve ever seen.\n\nAlthough our team wanted to remove these horses immediately, we planned with the friend for our return the following morning to create a care agreement that he was comfortable with to include visitation options, an opt-out option, and a purchase agreement for $10. Others might consider a different approach in this situation. And though it was challenging, our team opted to dig deep and not judge the horse owner’s friend but choose to remain neutral for the benefit of the horses. If a person feels judged by me or any of the staff at Horse & Halo, we will no longer be perceived as a resource. Upon returning the following morning, we loaded the horses as fast as we could, said our goodbyes, and invited the friend to visit any time. Here is a short video of Georgia unloading from the Horse & Halo trailer.\n\nFollowing their arrival, Fred and Georgia saw a veterinarian, and a health care plan was established. Although we did not meet the owner’s extended family, in the days that followed, we did receive a text message that said, “My sister loved her horses. Thank you for caring for them.”\n\nThe one struggle Fred had was the farrier. The farriers willing to work on drafts in our area are few and far between; this, coupled with his size and muscle atrophy (he had a hard time holding himself up), made it extremely challenging to find a farrier with the appropriate skillset to work under a large Clydesdale. In the beginning, I resigned myself to the fact that in an effort to keep everyone safe and keep moving forward with his health, he would need to be sedated. Although behind the scenes, I was clicker training Fred to lift his feet. Over time, we used clicker training to work on lifting his foot for hoof work. And the last time the farrier was here, Fred was willing to and capable of having his feet trimmed without sedation.\n\nFred has shown remarkable improvement, but Georgia struggled. Due to the lack of proper preventive care, nutrition, and hoof and dental care, she was highly vulnerable. Although we were fighting for Georgia and so badly wanted her to be happy and comfortable, her success story did not end the way we had hoped for her. During a bout of midnight colic, Georgia lacked the muscle strength she needed, and she became agitated and stressed. We chose to give her relief and peace from her discomfort. After all, it isn’t about writing a perfect success story; it’s about providing for a horse’s happiness, comfort, and quality of life.\n\nFred continued to gain weight and build muscle. His feet started to take a healthy shape. It was clear that he felt good. We began to see the “real Fred,” although he was lonely without Georgia. We introduced Fred to an orphaned rescued yearling, Ketchum, a very small-gaited gelding. The result? Fred and Ketchum have become the best of friends. They are complete opposites in size but adore each other’s company. Here’s a video of their extraordinary friendship. They have a morning ritual of play. They wait for one another at the gate, then they eat together and nap together. Fred and Ketchum have created an incredible bond.\n\nAlthough Fred and Georgia’s story ended under different circumstances, the overall story reveals the vast differences in the backgrounds of the horses we receive and care for and what Horse & Halo does to create a happy, healthy environment. What do they have in common? Owners who loved them but were affected by a terminal illness."
