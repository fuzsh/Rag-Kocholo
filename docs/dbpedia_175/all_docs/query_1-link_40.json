        "text": "Hey! So I decide that it would be a good idea to fill everyone in about this area of Texas. I spent 20 years of my life growing up in Liberty Hill, TX and know the area like the back of my hand. It's a beautiful area and awesome community but the cops are a bit much.\n\nNOT SO FUN STUFF:\n\nLaw enforcement: Burnet County is pretty lax however Williamson county (if you fly into ATX you have to drive through it) is not. Just for the fun of numbers Wilco has an 85% conviction rate on all crimes and is extremely anti any substance. They have been know to charge people differently based on race and most judges are far right leaning. The cops are also pretty aggressive when interacting with people they pull over so complie and bust out your best Texas accent and you'll be fine. The county also functions in a way that of you do get caught with drugs they will charge you the highest crime possible (higher bail) then degrade the crime. At the festivial don't be surprised if there is a heavy cop presence or that they are walking through the camp site.\n\nSource: Personally and friends/family members experince. I have had cops pull me over and accuse me having drugs on the way home from work. I have had friends who have had experiences with dogs falsely triggering on their car to initiate a search. I have seen caucasians get 2 years probation for a small amount of weed while a black friend got 6 years and some jail time for the same amount.\n\nTip: don't speed and (I DO NOT CONDONE THIS) if you're are going to drive inebriated take the back roads. Places to drive really careful through are Liberty Hill and Marble Falls. Speed drops significantly coming into these towns (65 -> 30)\n\nFUN STUFF:\n\nLake Buchanan is not far from the venue so if you have time go check it out.\n\nThere is cayon of the egales and inks lake state park both of which are pretty nice parks.\n\nLonghorn Caverns is close as well. It's a cave experince like no other. It use to be a speakeasy during probation and a concert venue back in the 40's. They also offer deep spluking tours\n\nBurnet has the best Whataburger for miles and it's still family owned. There's also a Storms which is similar to Culver's.\n\nIf you need to shop beforehand go to HEB.They are the best and similar to Mjers.\n\nThis area is also know for it's BBQ.\n\nIt might be hot or it could downpour this time of year so keep that mind while packing.\n\nEveryone is overall extremely friendly and talkative which can be refreshing to some and jarring for others.\n\nEveryone goes to chruch but they ain't pushy about it. Don't be surprised if you hear alot of \"You have a blessed day\" from local folks.\n\nLike most small Texas tons the busiest days are Sunday or Friday if there is a HS football game.\n\nBurnet is a small tight nit community so be respectful and they will respect you right back.\n\nFor the minorities who read this people won't be openly racist to you so you'll be fine. If your Asian (like my wife) you might get the typical small town glance of curiosity or a kid asking their mom \"why do they look like that\" with the mom explaining promptly that \"Jesus created us all differently\".\n\nIf you got time take a drive through the hill country back roads (west). I promise you won't regret it.\n\nIf your anti-gun don't worry Texans aren't as gun tote'n as the media make us out to be atleast not open carry wise. To most Texans a guns a tool for work or hunting not a plaything.\n\nBurnet has a ton of redneck hippies.\n\nLook where you walk. This is rattler country.\n\nFredericksburg is a cute little town and popular destination for moms looking to taste local wine. The hill county has a plethora of winery's to check out if your intrested.\n\nHope this helps. I'm sending y'all positive energy for your trip to Texas and hope y'all make it to Eclipse sound and safe. Just remeber to lead with a \"Howdy\" and you be welcome with open arms."
