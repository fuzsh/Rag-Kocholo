Here are some examples:\n\nCareer One Stop - Pathways to Success\n\nO*NET Online\n\nCareer Interests Game (University of Missouri)\n\nLabor Market and Career Information at Rural Capital Headlight\n\nThe ultimate purpose of a resume is to get you a job interview. But you should remember that it is your ‘advertisement’ – not your life story. A good resume will help ‘sell’ your specific skills, abilities and accomplishments and provides information that will let an employer know how you are a good match for the job.\n\nWorkshops are available to assist you with creating your resume. Check our events calendar for locations, dates and times or contact one of our offices for more information.\n\nA Labor Market is the ‘market’ in which workers compete for jobs and employers compete for workers. Understanding what is happening in your local, state and national labor market can help you to determine what type of job or career that you want to pursue.\n\nWorkforce Solutions provides various types of labor market data both through the Rural Capital Headlight website and our offices. Some of these include:\n\nTexas Labor Market Review (updated monthly)\n\nEmployment & Wages\n\nEmployment by Size Class\n\nEmerging and Evolving Occupations\n\nOccupational Outlook\n\nWhen you visit one of our offices, Workforce Solutions staff members are available to assist with the access and use of our primary job search tool, WorkInTexas.com.

It’s one of the few times that you will have several businesses and other employers gathered together in one spot for the sole purpose of talking to you about a job. Job fairs can also provide valuable information about what is happening in the local economy – what companies and industries are growing and what positions are in the most demand at that time.\n\nCheck our events calendar for the locations, dates and times of job fairs in your area or contact one of our offices for more information.\n\nAn interview is your chance to show an employer that your skills and experience would be a great asset to its operation. It is normal to be nervous before and about the interview, however, there are ways to prepare for and manage your anxiety.\n\nAt Workforce Solutions Rural Capital Area, our staff members can help you prepare for a job interview by answering a few simple questions:\n\nWhat do I wear?\n\nWhat kinds of questions will the interviewer ask?\n\nHow should I respond to tough personal questions?\n\nWhat kids of questions should I ask the employer?\n\nAre there some questions that are illegal for an employer to ask?\n\nAre there any rules or hints that might benefit me?\n\nFor more information concerning job interviews, visit one of our offices and ask about ‘Interviewing’ videos and books available in our Career Resource Library.\n\nThe topics of the workshops offered in our offices area as varied as they are many. They range from typical job search subjects such as resume writing and interviewing to tips for healthy living and family violence prevention. For more information concerning upcoming workshops and events, view our events calendar or contact one of our offices directly.\n\nYou may discover during the course of your career search that you need a certain kind of training or education for the type of job/career that you desire. Or, you may have other goals such as getting your GED or learning a new language that require further study.\n\nFor young people ages 16 through 24 that qualify as low income, Job Corps is a free education and training program that helps to learn a career, earn a high school diploma or GED, and find and keep a good job. Job Corps provides the all-around skills needed to succeed in a career and in life. For more information about what Job Corps has to offer, please vist http://jobcorps.gov/Home.aspx.
