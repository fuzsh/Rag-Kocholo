        "text": "The Southern Plains region—encompassing Texas, Oklahoma, southern Kansas, and western New Mexico—is characterized by climate extremes. At any given time, part of the region may be in drought while another is experiencing flooding rains. In the hot summer months, a location can flip from normal conditions to drought very quickly. The region is one of the world’s leading agricultural producers; even a very short dry period during a sensitive time in the crop cycle can have impacts on the global economy.\n\nFor example, the 2010–2015 Southern Plains drought had far-reaching impacts across economic sectors. Failure of winter wheat and summer crops during 2011 resulted in shortages of food for cattle, which forced farmers to purchase large amounts of hay or sell their herds. Additionally, the drought caused critical municipal water shortages and led to wildfire danger and other ecological impacts.\n\nIn 2011, NOAA’s National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) launched the Southern Plains Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) to meet the diverse needs of stakeholders who needed information on drought conditions and the forecasted outlook, but often on different spatial and temporal scales. The Southern Plains DEWS is a network of regional and national partners that share information and coordinate actions to help communities in the region cope with drought.\n\nReach out to Joel Lisonbee, the Regional Drought Coordinator for this region, for more information, or sign up for the Southern Plains DEWS newsletter.\n\nTexas Precipitation Conditions\n\nThis map shows total precipitation (in inches) for the past 7 days. Dark blue shades indicate the highest precipitation amounts.\n\nThis map shows precipitation for the past 30 days as a percentage of the historical average (1991–2020) for the same time period. Green/blue shades indicate above-normal precipitation, while brown shades indicate below-normal precipitation.\n\nThis map shows precipitation for the past 60 days as a percentage of the historical average (1991–2020) for the same time period.

Changes in precipitation can substantially disrupt crops and livestock, influence the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, and affect the quality and quantity of water available for municipal and industrial use.\n\nLearn More\n\nPeriods of drought can lead to inadequate water supply, threatening the health, safety, and welfare of communities. Streamflow, groundwater, reservoir, and snowpack data are key to monitoring and forecasting water supply.\n\nLearn More\n\nDrought can reduce the water availability and water quality necessary for productive farms, ranches, and grazing lands, resulting in significant negative direct and indirect economic impacts to the agricultural sector. Monitoring agricultural drought typically focuses on examining levels of precipitation, evaporative demand, soil moisture, and surface/groundwater quantity and quality.\n\nLearn More\n\nDrought is defined as the lack of precipitation over an extended period of time, usually for a season or more, that results in a water shortage.

The environmental consequences of drought include losses in plant growth; increases in fire and insect outbreaks; altered rates of carbon, nutrient, and water cycling; and local species extinctions.\n\nLearn More\n\nBecause energy and water are so interdependent, the availability and predictability of water resources can directly affect energy systems. Energy professionals need information on current drought conditions and outlooks in order to make informed decisions on cooling, alternative water supplies, pricing, and infrastructure security.\n\nLearn More\n\nDuring drought conditions that result in low water levels on rivers and other waterways, port and maritime navigation and transportation operations may be limited due to a reduction in available routes and cargo-carrying capacity, resulting in increased costs. In addition, higher temperatures that often coexist with drought can impact roads, airport runways, and rail lines.\n\nLearn More\n\nPeriods of drought can lead to inadequate water supply, threatening the health, safety, and welfare of communities.

Soil moisture observations can forewarn of impending drought or flood conditions before other more standard indicators are triggered.\n\nLearn More\n\nFlash drought is the rapid onset or intensification of drought. Unlike slow-evolving drought, which is caused by a decline in precipitation, flash drought occurs when low precipitation is accompanied by abnormally high temperatures, high winds, and/or changes in radiation. These sometimes-rapid changes can quickly raise evapotranspiration rates and remove available water from the landscape.\n\nLearn More\n\nSoil moisture plays an important role in drought and flood forecasting, agricultural monitoring, forest fire prediction, water supply management, and other natural resource activities.
