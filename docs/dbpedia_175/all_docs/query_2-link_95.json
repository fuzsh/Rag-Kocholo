        "text": "Is the Basic (free) version sufficient for my needs?\n\nThe Basic (free) database will meet many users' needs. You may want to purchase the Pro or Comprehensive versions if:\n\nYou need demographic data such as age, race, education or income.\n\nYou need data from the US territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands or the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nYou don't want to (or can't) attribute your use of our data on a public-facing website.\n\nDoes this database include administrative areas that the US government considers \"county equivalents\"?\n\nYes. The database includes both counties and county equivalents as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes parishes (Louisiana), boroughs (Alaska), population census areas (Alaska), and independent cities (Virginia) among others.\n\nAm I allowed to redistribute the database if I purchase a paid license?\n\nNo. You are not allowed to sell the database or make it publicly available. However, you can make copies and backups of the data. You are also allowed to query the database to power publicly facing applications such as a store locator. To learn more, read the full license terms.\n\nHow often do you release updates?\n\nIt depends, we monitor our sources and release new versions when we have more current data, typically a few times a year. Upon purchase, you can elect to receive email alerts when we release new versions of the database.\n\nWhy should I trust this data?\n\nThis database was aggregated from authoritative sources and carefully processed by SimpleMaps. We've been developing and selling interactive maps to Fortune 500 companies and prominent international organizations for over 14 years. Over this time, we've learned a lot about geographic data. To get a sense of the expertise and support we offer, check out some of the testimonials from our happy customers.\n\nIf I use the free database, what type of attribution is required?\n\nIf you use the Basic (free) database, you must link back to this page:\n\nhttps://simplemaps.com/data/us-counties\n\nfrom a public webpage where you are using the data. If you want to use the data internally, you must link back to this page from your firm's website on a page that can be easily found though links on the root domain. The link must be clearly visible to the human eye.\n\nHow recent are the economic and demographic variables such as income_household_median?\n\nThe fields of labor_force, labor_force_average, unemployment_rate, unemployment_rate_average come from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of the MM-YYYY specified by bls_date.\n\nAll other demographic variables come from the 2022 American Community Survey's 5-year estimates. We use 5-year estimates because they offer more precise estimates and provide better data coverage in low-population counties. The ACS is run by the United States Census Bureau.\n\nDoes this dataset include data from the 2020 Census?\n\nYes, this dataset is based on county, ZCTA, and place shapes from the 2020 Census. population data and other demographic fields come from the 2022 American Community Survey as noted above.\n\nHow do I calculate the distance between two counties?"
