        "text": "Burnet County ( BUR-nit) is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 49,130. Its county seat is Burnet. The county was founded in 1852 and later organized in 1854. It is named for David Gouverneur Burnet, the first (provisional) president of the Republic of Texas. The name of the county is pronounced with the emphasis or accent on the first syllable, just as is the case with its namesake.\n\nHistory\n\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the area as early as 4500 BC. Later known tribes in the area include Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche.\n\nDuring the 1820s-1830s, Stephen F. Austin and Green DeWitt conducted surveying and Indian-fighting explorations. In 1849, the United States established Fort Croghan, and in 1848, the first settlers arrived in the county, Samuel Eli Holland, Logan Vandeveer, Peter Kerr, William Harrison Magill, Noah Smithwick, Captain Jesse B. Burnham, R. H. Hall, Adam Rankin \"Stovepipe\" Johnson, and Captain Christian Dorbandt. In 1851, 20 Mormon families under the leadership of Lyman Wight establish a colony at Hamilton Creek, later to be known as Morman Mill.\n\nIn 1852, the Fourth Texas Legislature created Burnet County from Bell, Travis, and Williamson Counties. The first post office was established at Hamilton in 1853.\n\nIn 1860, 235 slaves were in Burnet County. After the war, some former slaves left the county, but many stayed. A group of them settled on land in the eastern part of Oatmeal. In 1870, the black population of the county had increased to 358, keeping pace with the growth of the total number of residents; the number of blacks had fallen to 248 by 1880, however, and the number of new white residents was such that after 1890, blacks represented less than 3% of the total population. Some found work on farms and ranches, but by the turn of the century, many had moved into the Marble Falls area to work in town.\n\nDuring 1882–1903, railroad tracks connected Burnet, Granite Mountain, Marble Falls, and Lampasas. Lake Victor and Bertram became shipping-point communities. Other communities lost population as the railroad offered employment. During the Great Depression, county farmers suffered financially, but found work with government-sponsored public-works projects. The Lower Colorado River Authority employed hundreds of people for the construction of the Hamilton (Buchanan) Dam and Roy B. Inks Dam.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,021 sq mi (2,640 km2), of which 27 sq mi (70 km2) (2.6%) are covered by water.\n\nMajor highways\n\nU.S. Highway 183\n\nU.S. Highway 281\n\nState Highway 29\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nLampasas County (north)\n\nBell County (northeast)\n\nWilliamson County (east)\n\nTravis County (southeast)\n\nBlanco County (south)\n\nLlano County (west)\n\nSan Saba County (northwest)\n\nNational protected area\n\nBalcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1860 2,487 — 1870 3,688 48.3% 1880 6,855 85.9% 1890 10,747 56.8% 1900 10,528 −2.0% 1910 10,755 2.2% 1920 9,499 −11.7% 1930 10,355 9.0% 1940 10,771 4.0% 1950 10,356 −3.9% 1960 9,265 −10.5% 1970 11,420 23.3% 1980 17,803 55.9% 1990 22,677 27.4% 2000 34,147 50.6% 2010 42,750 25.2% 2020 49,130 14.9% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1850–2010 2010 2020\n\nBurnet County, Texas - Demographic Profile\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2010 Pop 2020 % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 32,530 34,810 76.09% 70.85% Black or African American alone (NH) 700 579 1.64% 1.18% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 169 183 0.40% 0.37% Asian alone (NH) 198 424 0.46% 0.86% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 13 14 0.03% 0.03% Some other race alone (NH) 44 147 0.10% 0.30% Mixed/multiracial (NH) 444 1,774 1.04% 3.61% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 8,652 11,199 20.24% 22.79% Total 42,750 49,130 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.
