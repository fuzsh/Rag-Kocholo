        "text": "City in Texas, United States\n\nBurnet ( BUR-nit) is a city in and the county seat of Burnet County, Texas, United States.[4] Its population was 6,436 at the 2020 census.[5]\n\nBoth the city and the county were named for David Gouverneur Burnet, the first (provisional) president of the Republic of Texas. He also served as vice president during the administration of Mirabeau B. Lamar.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBurnet is located one mile west of the divide between the Brazos and Colorado River watersheds near the center of Burnet County. It is 54 miles (87 km) northwest of the state capital, Austin—roughly a 60- to 90-minute drive via U.S. Highway 183 and State Highway 29. It is 36 miles (58 km) west of Georgetown and Interstate Highway 35 via State Highway 29, and 100 miles (160 km) north of San Antonio on U.S. Highway 281.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Burnet has a total area of 10.2 square miles (26.3 km2), of which 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2), or 0.32%, is covered by water.[6]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Burnet has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps.[7] [8] Some temperatures at 90 °F (32 °C) or above have been observed in every month of the year.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 1847, a company of the Texas Ranger Division commanded by Henry E. McCulloch established a station at the site of present-day Burnet for the protection of frontier settlers from Indian raids. In March 1849, the station was chosen as a federal fort and named Fort Croghan.[11]\n\nA town was founded next to Fort Croghan in 1852, when Burnet County was established. The town was originally named Hamilton after John Hamilton, who owned a league and labor of land nearby. In August 1852, a post office was established in Hamilton and named Burnet Courthouse. In 1857, 35 residents of the town petitioned the state legislature to change the name of the town to Burnet since another town in Texas was named Hamilton; the name was changed in 1858. Major growth occurred with the arrival of the Austin and Northwestern Railroad in April 1882, when Burnet became the railhead for the area to the west. After the railroad was extended to Llano in 1892, Burnet declined as a supply point and became a farming and livestock center. The City of Burnet was incorporated in 1933.[12]\n\nThe Burnet Bulletin newspaper has served the community since 1873 and is the official paper of record for the city and Burnet County.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1870280—188049075.0%18901,454196.7%19001,003−31.0%1910981−2.2%1920966−1.5%19301,0559.2%19401,94584.4%19502,39423.1%19602,214−7.5%19702,86429.4%19803,41019.1%19903,4230.4%20004,73538.3%20105,98726.4%20206,4367.5%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nBurnet racial composition[15]\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)[a] Race Number Percentage White (NH) 4,415 68.6% Black or African American (NH) 152 2.36% Native American or Alaska Native (NH) 21 0.33% Asian (NH) 82 1.27% Pacific Islander (NH) 2 0.03% Some other race (NH) 27 0.42% Mixed/multiracial (NH) 229 3.56% Hispanic or Latino 1,508 23.43% Total 6,436\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, 6,436 people, 2,142 households, and 1,363 families resided in the city.
