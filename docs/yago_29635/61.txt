As Soaps.com predicted when General Hospital first revealed that One Life to Live vet Kassie DePaiva would be making some appearances as Blair Cramer, the long-running character will be the mysterious third ex-wife of Michael E. Knight’s Martin Grey, our sister site TVLine confirms.

The scheme queen must have been hitched to the shady lawyer sometime in the last decade, because in the 20-plus years that she spent in Llanview, her spouses were tycoon Asa Buchanan, volatile Todd Manning, rascally Max Holden, faux Todd Victor Lord Jr., Detective John McBain and loco Elijah Clarke. No Martin, perhaps because Laura’s brother was only introduced on General Hospital in 2019, and portrayer Knight was tied up as Tad Martin on All My Children for most of DePaiva’s run as Blair.

TVLine reports that the actress will share scenes with both Knight and Jane Elliot (Tracy). But we’ll keep our fingers crossed that Blair bumps into Austin (One Life to Live’s Todd, Roger Howarth) or Finn (One Life to Live’s McBain, Michael Easton).

DePaiva last crossed over Blair to General Hospital in 2012, when the show killed off daughter Starr’s significant other and their daughter. The alum of Guiding Light (as Chelsea) and Days of Our Lives (as Eve) previously worked with Knight (as Blair and Todd) in one of ABC Daytime’s 2003’s “What If” promos. (See below.)
