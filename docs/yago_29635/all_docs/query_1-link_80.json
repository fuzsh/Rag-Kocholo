        "text": "Evangeline Williamson\n\nTodd Manning #1\n\nTodd Manning #2\n\n\"Bo, thank Goodness!\" Evangeline said as she stepped up to him wearily. \"What's going on, Evangeline? Hey, Manning!\" Bo said as he glanced at Todd number one, before seeing out of his eye someone else , sitting in the bed. \"Hey, Manning. MANNING!\" Bo yelled as he quickly turned his head between the two. \"But-but.\" He stammered as Viki came in. \"Hello, Evangeline. What's the trouble? Has my brother done something that he can't seem to get himself out of.\" \"I wouldn't say that, Vik.\" Todd number one muttered. \"Why do you always assume that I am getting out of something.\" Todd number two asked as Viki, just smiled as she glanced up at Evangeline's tired ,strained look and Bo's shock and confusion before placing her coat and purse down to face the bed and was overwhelmed at the sight.\n\nShe began to rub her eyes as she blinked at the view before her. She glanced between the two men and it was like literally looking at a before and after ad. \"Todd?\" She carefully asked. \"Yes?\" They said in unison. Viki shook her head in disbelief as she stepped up more. \"Who are you?\" She asked Todd number two. \"I'm your baby brother, Viki. Todd Manning. Bastard child to Victor Manning. Father to Starr and Jack. On again and off again husband to Blair Cramer.\" He smiled at he as he ran a hand through his hair. \"No, this is my brother ,Todd.\"She pointed to Todd number one. \"At least I think so. I-I-.\" Was all Viki could get as she almost passed out on the floor.\n\nBo caught her as he and Evangeline helped her to a chair. \"See, this is why I couldn't tell you on the phone. You had to see it or at least try to see to try to believe it. \"Evangeline said as Bo sat down along with her. They watched Todd number one sit down to read while Todd number two turned on the TV. \"What do you know so far?\" Bo asked her. Evangeline sat back and glanced at them before she spoke. \"It's a short, but still not sure I believe it, story. But here goes.\"Evangeline began as she found a seat to sit in. \"I was with Todd number one.\" She points to the Todd who was with her all day. \"When I received a call about a man in the hospital, who says he was a client of mine. We got here and walked in and saw him. Todd number two. As I see your faces, I can tell you we both had the same look as you both have right now.\" Viki shook her head as she moved in the space between Todd number two and Todd number one.\n\n\"Todd?\" She said softly in a shaky tone as she moved her head back and forth, looking at them both. \"Yeah?\" They both answered. \"Okay.\" Evangeline said as she stood up and held her hands in a stop motion. \"Enough of the talking in stereo. It's trippy enough with this whole twilight zone moment. The talking at the same time, saying the same thing is just down right creepy.Viki.\" She softly said to the older woman, letting her have her seat. Evangeline went to the pitcher next to Todd number two and poured a glass of water for Viki. \"Here you go.\" She said, handing her the cup. \"Thank you, Evangeline.\" Viki said before she took a few sips.\n\nBo couldn't believe it himself as he looked between the two of them. He cleared his throat and put his hands on his hips, signalling he was in cop mode. \"Okay, Manning.\" He began as Todd number two spoke up. \"Bo, I just need to get out of here and see my kids and Blair.\" Evangeline looked at Bo as he sighed. Todd number one just laughed a bit. Todd number two narrowed his eyes as he glanced an irritated look at Todd number one. \"What's so funny?\"\n\nTodd number one just shook his head some before he breathed with a smile upon his lips. \"The fact that Blair has moved on and -.\" He paused before he stopped himself. \"I just want a front row seat for what he will see as seeing my ex-wife looking at this impostor with my old face.\" He laughed again. \"This is going to be good.\" \"Ex-wife? Your old face?\" Todd number two stated in confusion. \"It's you who's the impostor. Fooling my family, my kids, and my lawyer. That's it!\" He said as he sat up completely. \"I want a blood test done! I want us to prove what in the hell is really going on. \" Todd number number two demanded. \"I agree! In fact, Bo, I want an investigation on this whole thing.\" Bo nodded. \"I agree with you both. In fact, I will go talk to someone right now.\"\n\nThey watched Bo leave as a nurse came in. \"Well, Mr. Manning. It seems that the bruises and cuts are going to be fine. You are free to go. Do you have somewhere to stay, where we can reach you at?\" Todd number two smiled as he looked at the nurse. \"Well, I thought I had my old place, or could stay with family. But it seemed that things have changed. Then again, I do have a friend I could stay with for a while.\" \"Really? Where?\" The nurse said as he grinned while looking at Evangeline. \"At Ms. Evangeline Williamson's place.\" Todd number one jumped in front of Evangeline protectively as he glared at Todd number two. \"Like hell, you will!\""
