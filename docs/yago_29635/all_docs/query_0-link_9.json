        "text": "Vote on what Blair should to next here\n\nTake the Blairian Challenge (our trivia game) here\n\nBlair Cramer Holden's Biography\n\nBlair arrived in Llanview in October 1991 intending to do whatever it took to become powerful and wealthy.\n\nWhile working as a journalistic apprentice at The Banner, Blair set her sights on the rich Asa Buchanan. However, Blair soon encountered Max Holden! The sexual chemistry between them was instant as they shared a sizzling midnight dance on New Year's Eve.\n\nThough Max persisted in pursuing Blair in 1992, she was busy wooing Asa Buchanan away from his wife, Renee. Blair was equally determined to claw her way to the top of the business world, even if it meant destroying her own Aunt Dorian to do it. Finding a skeleton in Dorian's closet, Blair used blackmail (Dorian's involvement with Victor Lord's death,) to force her Aunt to make her the new Editor-in-Chief of Llanview's tabloid newspaper, The Intruder.\n\nMax Holden was determined to stop Blair from marrying Asa Buchanan. On Asa and Blair's wedding day -- June 16th, 1992 -- passion exploded between Max and Blair. They made love -- on top of Blair's wedding dress! Still, Blair went through with the wedding, but when she wouldn't sleep with her husband, the marriage was doomed. Left with nothing, Blair departed Llanview. In December 1993, she returned and founded a cosmetics company Melador. After failing to win Max back, Blair crossed paths with Llanview's other pariah, Todd Manning. She found him intriguing -- and he was equally attracted to her. Blair took Todd back to her apartment and they made love.\n\nWhen she discovered, in 1995, that Todd was Victor Lord's long-lost son (and worth $27.8 million dollars!) Blair plotted to marry him by claiming to be pregnant. When a suspicious Todd forced his new wife to have a pregnancy test, it came back positive! Tragedy struck when Blair was mugged on the docks, and lost her unborn baby. Thanks to Max, Todd learned the truth about Blair's faked pregnancy and divorced her. Then Blair discovered she was pregnant -- again! When Todd found out, they reconciled and married again - this time in a beautiful ceremony at St. James Church. Just before their honeymoon, Todd was shot and purportedly killed in Ireland while helping Marty Saybrooke. Bitter, Blair vowed revenge on Marty by seducing her secret beau, Patrick Thornhart.\n\nOn January 8th, 1996, the \"widow Manning\" gave birth to a daughter, Starr. During the following summer, Todd Manning \"returned from the dead\" only to see Blair in Patrick's arms, about to make love. Reeling from the sight of his wife in the arms of the man responsible for his \"death,\" Todd rejected Blair. Though they were forced to work together, sexual tension filled the air whenever Todd and Blair were in the same room. Just when it appeared that they might reconcile, Blair discovered that she was pregnant with Patrick's baby!\n\nIn 1997, Blair's life was turned upside down when her daughter, Starr, fell ill with aplastic anemia. Blair's unborn son (which she planned to name Brendan) was found to be a match. However, before the procedure could take place, Blair lost the baby in a car accident. Fortunately, Starr's life was spared when a donor, Alex Olanov, was found. Blair, who was injured in the crash, left for Philadelphia to have surgery. Upon her return, would Blair and Todd be able to put their troubled past behind them, and find happiness together?\n\nBlair and Todd's life together wasn't meant to be and their marriage ended bitterly in 1997. Blair soon lost custody of her little girl!\n\nBlair was eventually given visitation right to Starr when she provided Todd with a much needed alibi when he was accused of rape. When Todd later left town, Blair got custody of Starr and 49% of The Sun!\n\nBlair had a brief affair with Sam Rappaport, but always seemed to return to Max. Determined to provide a better life for Max and their children, Blair convinced Max to con Asa and Renee into thinking he was the missing Buchanan heir!"
