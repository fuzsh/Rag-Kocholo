        "text": "Kassie DePaiva‘s Blair Cramer is back in action.\n\nThe 62-year-old soap star will head to General Hospital‘s Port Charles as her One Life to Live alter-ego, ABC revealed to TVLine.\n\nHer appearance will begin airing in September, an ABC rep also confirmed to the outlet.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nThis isn’t her first trip to the soap: In March 2012, just two months after One Life to Live ended its broadcast run on ABC, she starred as Blair in General Hospital for a multi-month crossover event that also featured Roger Howarth, also known as Todd Manning.\n\nEarlier this month, Kassie, who recently returned to Days of Our Lives as Eve Donovan, discussed a possible return to General Hospital.\n\n“There’s a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge, but I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go, ‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know,’” she teased to Soap Opera Digest."
