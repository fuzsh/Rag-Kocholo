        "text": "Kassie DePaiva and former One Life to Live scene partner Roger Howarth are both beaming in a photo snapped on the set of General Hospital, where DePaiva today begins a brief arc as the one and only Blair.\n\n“Reunited and it feels so good!!!” wrote DePaiva on X, alongside the aforementioned photo (seen below).\n\nAs recently confirmed by TVLine, it will be revealed that OLTL‘s Blair is the mysterious third ex-wife of Martin Grey, played by All My Children-turned-GH cast member Michael E. Knight.\n\nDePaiva will also share scenes with GH vet Jane Elliot, who plays Tracy Quartermaine.\n\nAs we noted when we broke the news of DePaiva’s casting last month, this will not be the OLTL alum’s first trip to GH. In March 2012 — just two months after OLTL ended its broadcast run on ABC — the three-time Daytime Emmy nominee brought Blair to GH for a multi-month crossover event that also featured Howarth as Todd Manning.\n\nHowarth has been starring on GH for much of the past decade in myriad new roles, first as Franco Baldwin (R.I.P.) and currently as Austin Gatlin-Holt."
