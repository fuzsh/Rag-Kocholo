        "text": "fuckyeaholtl:\n\nshrinkmetodd:\n\nTodd & Viki 1998 - Todd tells Viki goodbye after the DID scam. Viki tells him that he really hurt her this time. Todd tells her that he is sorry but she can’t forgive him (yet) and tells him he needs to go some place where the only voice he hears is his own. Very emotional and extremely well played scene. Kudos to RH and ES. It made me bawl for 10 minutes\n\nI remember being in middle school and being amazed by this scene when it first aired. It gets better each time I watch it.\n\n“You’re not Victor Lord—no matter how hard you try to turn yourself into him…that doesn’t mean you can’t still lead a miserable life and hurt everyone who ever tried to love you.”\n\nThe Viki/Todd dynamic always has been one of the best things on this show.\n\nangels4tnb:\n\nemphasismine:\n\nI’m always trying to articulate the feeling I want epic romantic stories to embody, both in what I write myself (fanfiction) and in what I read (pro and fan). And there is this feeling that comes when you create real romantic chemistry and tension and/or UST.\n\nTHIS SCENE. THIS SCENE IS THE EPITOME OF WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT. Todd and Blair’s goodnight “kiss” from New Year’s Eve when she tells him he can’t spend the night. There is so much longing and romance and general epicness in what is a fairly tame little exchange. Every time I hear the music swell and watch Blair’s eyelids flutter like she’s going to die just because Todd is touching her…it makes me want to cry from all the feelings and it’s the most awesome feeling ever.\n\nLOOK AT HER FACE. LOOK AT THE LONGING AND CONFLICT AND SHEER SEXUAL FRUSTRATION AND EVERYTHING. OH MY GOD. Perfect scene is perfect. ♥\n\nThe feelings, the FEELINGS! Omigawd, the feelings these two give me is just WOW! You described it perfectly.\n\nIt’s so perfect. You can FEEL how she wants to just bury her hands in his hair and hold him to her and you FEEL that with the slightest touch or encouragement form her, he would devour her right there on the foyer floor. But they restrain themselves and just drown in the moment, in the want, the need, the connection and the certain knowledge of where it will all end. Maybe not tonight, but soon and for the rest of their lives ;)\n\nI love the next moment when he’s raising his head and it’s all very deliberate and leashed passion on his part, and her head comes close to his and their eyes meet and she’s drowning in her longing and he’s making a promise with his eyes and you KNOW he just marked her. You KNOW there’s no escape now. And he KNOWS it and so he can pull himself away, satisfied she’ll be dreaming of him and only him and she’s left with a look of devastated surrender on her face. She was going to wait. She was going to use her head….yeah, you can’t control a love like that. Todd stopped trying ages ago."
