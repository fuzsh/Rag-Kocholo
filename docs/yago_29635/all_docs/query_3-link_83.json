        "text": "Lili Manning, 64, went home to be with the Lord after her courageous battle with cancer on February 17, 2021, surrounded by her loving family.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2:00PM on Sunday, February 21, 2021 at Wilkerson Funeral Home. Burial will follow at Pelham United Methodist Church Cemetery, where she will be laid to rest with her late husband, Steven. The family will receive friends one hour prior to the service at the funeral home. Friends and family are invited to come to Wilkerson Funeral Home during business hours on Saturday to see her and sign the register book.\n\nLili was born on July 31, 1956 to Patsy Layne and the late Harold Layne at Ellsworth Airforce Base in South Dakota. She was a well-known hairdresser for over 40 years in the Danville Area. Lili was a co-owner of Youâ€™topia where she worked for over 30 years. Later, she worked at Designing Women where she retired due to her battle with cancer. Everyone who knew Lili knew she loved horses, and they played an integral part in her life. She was known for her iconic western fashion with her cowgirl hats, boots, and jewelry. More than anything, Lili loved spending time with friends, family, and especially her grandchildren. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.\n\nIn addition to her father, she was preceded in death by her husband, Steve Manning.\n\nLili is survived by her mother, Patsy V. Layne; sons, Brad Norton and girlfriend Jennifer Garrison of Pelham; Todd Norton and wife Bridget of Benson; step-children, Laura Walker and husband Eric of Danville; Josh Manning and wife Rachel of Blanch; grandchildren, Alexandria Norton, Landon Norton, Grace Norton, Taylor Norton, Maddy Walker, Cate Walker, Rhett Manning, Riley Manning, Jayden Walker, Kyndall Walker; brothers, Harold J. Layne, Jr. and wife Terri; Timothy B. Layne and wife Beth; her dog and faithful companion, Dixie. In addition, she is survived by numerous nieces, nephews, and other extended family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Hospice of Rockingham County , PO Box 281, Wentworth, NC 27375; Pelham United Methodist Church, 594 Red Marshall Rd, Pelham, NC 27311; or the American Cancer Society, P.O. Box 22478 Oklahoma City, OK 73123.\n\nThe family would like to say a special note of thanks to Alexandria, her oldest granddaughter, who provided exceptional care and loving support to Lili this past year. They would also like to say thank you to everyone who stopped by to see her, brought food, sent cards, and the many, many prayers."
