        "text": "The theme of the Aug. 8-18 Illinois State Fair in Springfield is \"It's Showtime,\" and fair officials have planned a full schedule of activities and events that live up to that catchphrase, including the unveiling of the newly-renovated Coliseum and other recent fairgrounds improvements.\n\nThe $31.5 million state-funded Coliseum renovation is the most prominent of the numerous construction projects totaling $85.3 million that will improve the fair experience, according to Illinois Department of Agriculture director Jerry Costello.\n\n\"We're really excited to welcome our horse shows back to the Coliseum during the fair this year,\" Costello said. \"I also want to highlight the Multipurpose Arena; it's fully upgraded and some of the most exciting events of this year's fair will be held there.\"\n\nFairgoers may not immediately notice the road resurfacing, roof repair and pedestrian tunnel work that has been done on the fairgrounds, but the newly-improved Happy Hollow will be on full display as it is transformed into an 800-seat big top circus with three free daily performances under a huge, colorful tent. There's also something for visitors who want to test their own feats of skill and strength.\n\n\"Many of you have probably seen \"American Ninja Warrior: on television and thought, 'Yeah, I can do that,'\" said Illinois State Fair manager Rebecca Clark. \"Well, this year you can put your skills to the test when Neutron Ninja brings an obstacle course to be featured in front of the Coliseum every day of the fair.\"\n\nClark also invited families to see \"The Adventures of Peter Pan and Wendy,\" a fairy tale on ice performance inside the air-conditioned Orr Building on the last weekend of the fair.\n\nFree tram rides with stops around the fairgrounds will return, courtesy of the Illinois Corn Growers, and Clark said the fair's famous food offerings will include a competitive edge this year.\n\n\"We are proud to partner with Neuhoff Media to host the Golden Abe's Fantastic Fair Food Contest where our vendors will go head-to-head in a culinary competition,\" Clark said. \"The contest will take place on Friday, Aug. 9, and people's choice voting will get underway the next day.\"\n\nAnd if you don't have the appetite – or the budget – to sample all the food offerings, the Small Plates, Big Tastes promotion allows visitors to get sample-size portions from any Village of Cultures vendor.\n\n\"We wanted to give fairgoers a way to 'travel' around the world in the Village of Cultures without breaking the bank,\" said Clark. \"The sample-size portions allow fairgoers to try foods from many different parts of the world, and if they enjoy what they try, they can go back for the full-size portion.\"\n\nThe popular \"Feeding Frenzy\" will also return this year. The Jaws theme song will be played over loudspeakers to mark the beginning and end of the frenzy that runs every weekday of the fair from 2-5 p.m. When the music sounds (15 minutes prior to the discounts starting, and 15 minutes before they end), participating vendors will reduce prices on select menu items.\n\nThe State Fair's raison d'etre is agriculture, and the Department of Agriculture tent will highlight Illinois-grown and produced products every day. The tent will also host the Ag Venture kids hands-on experience complete with pedal tractors, corn sensory bins and agriculture-related crafts.\n\n\"The Illinois Farm Bureau Stage features unique, free, agriculture-based entertainment and the USDA Beagle Brigade will demonstrate how beagles keep our country safe by inspecting luggage at airports,\" said Department of Agriculture marketing director Jackie Sambursky. \"The Beekeepers of Illinois also have an unbelievable show.\"\n\nSambursky said that in keeping with the fair's agricultural theme, the parade marshals for the Thursday, Aug. 8, State Fair Parade will be representatives of the 6,100 youth members of 4H who annually participate in the Illinois State Fair.\n\nThe 30-acre Conservation World area on the north side of the fairgrounds will have several new experiences to supplement traditional favorite activities, all dedicated to the memory of former Department of Natural Resources Director Brent Manning, who died earlier this year.\n\n\"For the first time ever, we are offering sensory hours for families and individuals seeking a quieter, calmer space for persons with sensory processing sensitivities,\" said Illinois Department of Natural Resources assistant director Todd Strole.\n\nThe special sensory hours in Conservation World will be between 8 and 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 13 and Saturday, Aug. 17. Conservation World is open for general visitation from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day of the fair.\n\nStrole added that families can also attend an 80th birthday party for Smokey the Bear on Friday, Aug. 9, take photos with a full-size replica bald eagle nest and view the 350 entries from the statewide Cicada Art Contest.\n\nThe official flavor of the fair, courtesy of Illinois' dairy farmers, is raspberry crunch. It will be served with ice cream at the fair's Dairy Building, where you can also see this year's version of the famous butter cow, plus the entries from Illinois Times' miniature butter cow contest. That location is a good place to relax and unwind, according to Kendra Anderson of the Midwest Dairy Association.\n\n\"Get ready to kick back and relax in our Cozy Cow Lounge where you can chill like a cow in our comfortable cabana and dive into the world of cow comfort,\" Anderson said. \"Enjoy a serene space designed to let you unwind, just like our bovine friends do.\"\n\nThis year's State Fair Grandstand entertainment lineup includes: Aug. 9, Keith Urban; Aug. 10, Motley Crue; Aug. 11, Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit; Aug. 13, Jordan Davis; Aug. 14, Lil Wayne; Aug. 15, Jonas Brothers; Aug. 16, Smashing Pumpkins; Aug. 17, Miranda Lambert; and Aug. 18, Shaboozey.\n\nOther major events scheduled during the fair include: Aug. 10, rodeo; Aug. 12-14, Truck and Tractor Pulls; Aug. 17, USAC Silver Crown Series car races and Demolition Derby; Aug. 17-18, Fairy Tales on Ice - The Adventures of Peter Pan and Wendy; Aug. 18, ARCA Super Series auto races.\n\nState Fair Manager Rebecca Clark said the Illinois State Fair is one of the most affordable fairs in the Midwest. Kids 12 and under are admitted free every day; there are discounted or free admission days for veterans, senior citizens, scouts, first responders, and health care workers; and adult weekday admission is just $5, or half of the $10 admission for Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\"We have a $2 admission day for adults on Aug. 13. You can park your car on the grounds for just $5. We have a day where our carnival rides are $2 and another day where all of the rides are just $3,\" Clark said. \"We understand that many families have limited funds to spend on entertainment, and that's why we're doing what we can to allow you to create memories that will last a lifetime without breaking the bank.\"\n\nLast year the Illinois State Fair set a new attendance record with more than 700,000 people coming through the gates. Agriculture Director Jerry Costello hopes to break that record this year.\n\n\"We're all aware that to have a good fair you need good weather,\" Costello said. \"But there's no doubt about what this team has been able to put together for this year's Illinois State Fair.\""
