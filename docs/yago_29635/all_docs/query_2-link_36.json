        "text": "August 28, 1970 - April 10, 2014\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_8124\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"328\"] Bryant Manning Jolley[/caption]\n\nBryant Manning Jolley died Thursday, April 10, at St. Vincent Hospital in Billings with his hands being held by his wife Dawn and daughter Brittania, his heart being held by many.\n\nBryant was born Aug. 28, 1970, to Don and Sheila Jolley in Powell. He grew up in Lovell surrounded by the Jolley family, enjoying family traditions, time on the mountain, horse riding in the hills, mischief with his brothers and cousins and trips to the sale barn with his grandpa.\n\nBryant graduated from Lovell High School in 1988, a member of the Honor Society, FFA and an award-winning welder. It was there he made lifelong friendships, met his wife Dawn and “fell in love on a tractor tire” as he put it. Bryant and Dawn were married Feb. 5, 1990, and eventually became the parents of Todd Manning (1990), Brittania Bri’ant (1993), Kenna Marie (1996) and Gaten Nicholas (1999). The most recent addition to his family on March 8 was his much loved granddaughter Chloe Bree, who he was so very happy to see born and had already nicknamed his “Chickadee.”\n\nMemories were made and friendships grown in Lovell, Powell and for the past 12 years in Worland. Bryant loved to camp and fish and was already making plans to take Chloe camping for the first time and to finish the fishing boat he bought for his son Gaten, who was his camping buddy, a special connection he treasured greatly. He adored his daughters, his beloved “squirrel girls,” and was so proud of his son Todd, always telling people about his latest world travels and how much he was becoming a good man. Bryant was known to be friendly and always wanted to help people. He was also known to play pranks and enjoyed pestering and scaring people saying, “It makes me giggle.”\n\nThree infant brothers and two infant sisters preceded him in death. Bryant’s life was short and sometimes hard, but his heart was big and his love was wide."
