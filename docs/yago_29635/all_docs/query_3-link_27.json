        "text": "Robert S. Woods (\"Bo Buchanan\")\n\nEmmy Award-winning actor Robert S. Woods plays the role of Bo Buchanan, the handsome younger son of the rich and powerful Buchanan family. Recently divorced from wife Nora, Bo is trying to get his personal life back on track, while professionally he continues to succeed as Llanview's determined police commissioner. Woods created the role of Bo Buchanan in 1979, and quickly skyrocketed to stardom, receiving an Emmy Award in 1982 as Outstanding Lead Actor, as well as four other nominations -- in 1986, 1993, 1994 and 1999.\n\n\"It's really interesting to play a character for 20 years. Bo is older that he was when I started, and hopefully more mature.\"\n\nHe continues to receive other critical recognition for his work as Bo, including multiple award nominations from Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Update. He won his second MVP trophy from Soap Opera Update in 1998. After six years as Bo, Woods chose to take a hiatus from the show and headed to the West Coast to pursue other acting opportunities. During that time, he portrayed Commander Eugene Lindsey in the acclaimed 1988 miniseries, War and Remembrance. He also starred in the Los Angeles production of Stitch and Eubie, which won the DramaLogue Critics Choice Award; the television movie, Carly's Web; and the pilot, Changing Patterns. In 1988, he decided to return to One Life to Live and continues to take on other acting gigs as well. Most recently, he guest starred on Roseanne; on USA Network?wamp Thing; and in the Lifetime movie, Deadly Love. He is currently developing several television projects, including The Garth Ryland Mysteries, based on a series of popular novels by author John R. Riggs.\n\nIn 1971, when he returned home to his native California after 15 months as a Green Beret in Vietnam with the Army's Fifth Special Forces Group, Woods went to California State University at Long Beach to complete his broadcasting degree. During school, and upon graduation, he studied at the Film Actors Workshop, The James Best Theatre Centre, The Directors Lab, and The First Acting Company Workshop.\n\nIn the mid-1970s he was starring in theater productions at Disneyland's Drama Workshop, where he did plays for the theme park's employees on evenings when Disneyland was closed to the public. Woods spent time acting in U.S. Army training films, and on stage in many theater productions, most notably a starring role with Dorothy Lamour in a Los Angeles dinner theater production of Barefoot in the Park. He then got his big television break on the series, City of Angels.\n\nIn steady succession, Woods landed the recurring roles of Dr. David Spencer in The Waltons and Lt. Bob King in Project UFO, as well as guest-starring appearances in series such as Family and Newhart, and made-for-television movies including Chase, Just a Little Inconvenience, The Night They Took Miss Beautiful, Police Story and Fantasies. Feature films in which he has appeared include The China Syndrome and Big Wednesday. Woods and his family -- his wife, actress Loyita Chapel and their son, Tanner -- spend time between their Manhattan apartment and their Carpenter Gothic 1880 home in upstate New York\n\nCatherine Hickland (\"Lindsay Rappaport\")\n\nDate of birth (location)\n\n11 February 1956,\n\nFort Lauderdale, Florida, USA"
