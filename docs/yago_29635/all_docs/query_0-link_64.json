        "text": "General Hospital comings and goings reveal the reason legacy character Blair Cramer is coming to Port Charles. And it will upend several lives on the ABC sudser.\n\nGeneral Hospital Comings & Goings: Blair Cramer Mystery Revealed!\n\nGH casting updates see Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) in town soon — and now we know why. It was recently reported that Blair’s the mysterious third ex-wife of legal eagle Martin Gray (Michael E. Knight).\n\nSince Marty’s been on the scene he’s been open about his three ex-wives and that he pays them alimony. However, in a shocking twist, we recently learned that ex-wife #3 pays Martin $50,000 per month.\n\nHis current love, Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) recently found out on General Hospital. And now she thinks that’s the reason Martin doesn’t ever want to remarry — he doesn’t want to lose the cash. But, he’s got bigger problems.\n\nHe was the inspiration for Lucy’s Deception product, The Deceptor. But, it looks like he got the idea from his former wifey, Blair. And he accidentally gave the idea to Lucy. And soon, she’s about to show up in Port Chuck to prove it.\n\nGH Casting News: Blair & Tracy Go after Lucy\n\nMore General Hospital casting info suspects Blair is the person Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) is working with to sue Lucy. And they’ve got All My Children hotshot attorney Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey) from Pine Valley to help them.\n\nIndeed, Tracy has always hated Lucy for having an affair with her brother Alan Quartermaine (Stuart Damon) decades ago. Furthermore, if she helps Blair get Lucy to settle without going to trial Tracy gets 75% of Deception.\n\nThat way she gets control of the company and her revenge. But, on top of that, Lucy’s relationship with Marty may be kaput once Blair arrives.\n\nGeneral Hospital Casting Updates: Happy Reunion for Kassie DePaiva\n\nWhile Blair’s return will wreak havoc on Lucy and her Deception partners, it’s great news for her alter-ego Kassie DePaiva. She came to GH back in 2012 when One Life to Live went off the air.\n\nJoining her was her now ex-husband, Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). Since then, Blair went back to Llanview, Pennsylvania and Roger Howarth stepped into the role of Franco Baldwin.\n\nSince Franco’s tragic murder, Roger came back to General Hospital as Austin Holt. So, Kassie is thrilled to reunite with her former colleague. And there might even be some surprise interaction between them.\n\nTheir paths may cross while she is in town to confront Marty. Get ready for fireworks on GH. Blair Cramer’s back and PC won’t know what hit it on the ABC soap opera."
