        "text": "When originally cast as \"Todd Manning\" on Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), he was only supposed to play a minor, supporting character in the infamous fraternity gang rape storyline. The character was supposed to be written out at the conclusion of that storyline. However, his portrayal quickly won over fans, who wrote to the producers asking that his character be kept on the show, permanently. As a result, he was offered a longterm contract and the character of \"Todd Manning\" became one of the series' major arch villains.\n\nHowarth met his wife, actress Cari Stahler, in a New York City café, where she worked, and he lived upstairs. Cari asked him out on a date to Coney Island. They married in 1992.\n\nAfter only one semester at George Washington University, where he was studying political science, he dropped out to join an intense acting program at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Connecticut."
