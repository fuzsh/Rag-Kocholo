        "text": "Port Charles will play host to another ABC Daytime alum this fall when Kassie DePaiva brings her One Life to Live alter ego, Blair Cramer, to General Hospital for a brief stint.\n\nDePaiva will begin airing in September, an ABC rep confirms, although it’s unclear what brings Blair to town (zoom in on her phone in the exclusive image above for a possible clue.)\n\nThis will not be DePaiva’s first trip to OLTL‘s sister soap. In March 2012, just two months after OLTL ended its broadcast run on ABC, the actress brought Blair to GH for a multi-month crossover event that also featured her longtime Llanview leading man Roger Howarth, AKA Todd Manning. Coincidentally, Howarth has been starring on GH for much of the past decade in myriad new roles, first as Franco Baldwin (R.I.P.) and, currently, as Austin Gatlin-Holt.\n\nEarlier this month, DePaiva — who recently returned to Days of Our Lives as Eve Donovan — discussed a possible GH return (and the inevitable deja vu with Howarth), telling Soap Opera Digest that she would be game to return to the soap as Blair.\n\n“There’s a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge,” she told to the mag, before acknowledging, “But I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn’t recognize me. But I could go, ‘You’re hot. You look like somebody I used to know.'”"
