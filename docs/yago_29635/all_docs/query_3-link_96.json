        "text": "Tomorrow, the long-running ABC soap One Life to Live signs off – forever.\n\nSo Greg In Hollywood continues to celebrate the hunky men of Llanview this week.\n\nToday, the spotlight falls on the two actors who played the role of Todd Manning: Roger Howarth and Trevor St. John.\n\nRoger originated the role of Todd in 1992 and won a Daytime Emmy for his performance in 1994.\n\nTrevor took over the role of Todd in 2003 and the change of appearance was explained by Todd having a face-altering accident. The two actors overlapped last year with both claiming to be the real Todd Manning.\n\nAnd here’s some great news: while OLTL goes off the air tomorrow, the character of Todd will continue to be played by Roger Howarth on ABC’s General Hospital. Also reprising their OLTL roles on GH will be Kassie DePaiva, Michael Easton and Kristen Alderson."
