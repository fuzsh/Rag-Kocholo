        "text": "A product of rape. Abandoned. Raised in orphanages and foster care. A runaway who survived on the streets selling jewelry until she got picked up and taken back into the system. Raised in that same system until she was 18 when she gave herself a last name she thought sounded â€˜classy', \"Daimler\", and went to figure out where the hell she came from.\n\nShe busted her mother out of a state run asylum and showed up in Llanview with two goals: land a rich husband and get revenge on the family that abandoned her and her mother.\n\nFunny how things turn out, isn't it?\n\nBlair got her rich husband... Asa Buchanan... and faked a pregnancy to keep out of her bed, went through a bout of marital rape, and was in love with Max Holden the whole time. That marriage ended with Addie in St. Anne's and Blair divorced with nothing to show for it... not even her jewelry company. And Max had started to fall in love with another woman.\n\nShe left town after almost having an affair with Cord Roberts and watching him get washed away in Jaba City. She showed up over a year later... looking quite a bit different and still on the look out for true love, money and family.\n\nShe got all of those things although not nearly in the way she expected.\n\nHer first order of business was to get Max Holden back... at the time, she believed he was the love of her life and she was his. She preyed on his weaknesses and did sweep him into an affair but it was ill-advised, short-lived and ended when she accidentally hit Luna Moody-Holden with a truck.\n\nCord Roberts reached out to her, recognizing that damaged soul for what it was... someone who just needed to be loved and to have someone on her side. While we can give him credit for trying, it never quite worked out for them. He was always going to be tied to Tina Clayton-Lord and Blair was never going to settle for less.\n\nEnter Todd Manning, rapist, killer, all around bad guy. He was fresh from prison, paroled with an ankle monitor strapped to him when he asked if anyone was sitting next to her at the local dive bar, Rodi's. Was anyone expecting what happened next?\n\nBlair finally met her true love although it took the better part of a year for her to realize it. With Todd she experienced the expectation of motherhood, the painful loss of that child, acceptance and love, the loss of that love due to her own lies, fear, revenge and, ultimately, recapturing everything they had built and then some... capped off with a shower of golden balloons only to to lose it all again.\n\nBlair Cramer is fiercely loyal to those she loves, her children first and foremost and her family, the indomitable Cramer clan. She continues to put her heart on the line even with all of her bad choices when it comes to love. She knows what love is and keeps reaching for it, especially with that one man who has loved her more and hurt her more than any other.\n\nUltimately, Blair is a survivor. She was from the beginning and she will be until the end. She is a survivor with one secret weapon; a powerful heart full of love and forgiveness for those she cares about."
