4 September 2017: Handicapped Future + Huie’s Sermon

Handicapped Future

Werner Herzog

1971 | 43 min | Colour | Digital

“A practical documentary to raise public awareness about the need for disability access in Germany, using recent disability rights legislation in the United States for comparison. During its filming, Herzog met Fini Straubinger, a woman whose deafness and blindness allows her to only communicate via a tactile language. The resulting documentary, Land of Silence and Darkness, expands several themes that run throughout Herzog’s oeuvre in films like Last Words, Kaspar Hauser and Lessons of Darkness.” – Senses of Cinema
