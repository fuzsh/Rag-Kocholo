        "text": "Dear IDA Members,\n\nAs an organization that celebrates the power of storytelling through nonfiction filmmaking, I want to take a moment to highlight July as Disability Pride Month.\n\nIn my role as the Nonfiction Access Initiative (NAI) Funds Program Manager at IDA, I am deeply committed to promoting an inclusive culture at IDA that embraces the experiences and perspectives of disabled nonfiction media makers. Disability Pride Month holds a special significance for me and many others, as it offers the opportunity to center the experiences and stories of disabled filmmakers. This month also serves as a reminder of the invaluable contributions of disabled filmmakers and their profound impact on the art of nonfiction storytelling.\n\nWhile documentaries have long benefited from stories about disability, there has been a systematic lack of opportunity for disabled filmmakers to authentically tell stories. Too often, these narratives have been subject to an othering perspective, perpetuating stereotypes and failing to provide a true representation of the disabled experience. It is within this context that a call to action in the nonfiction community urges us to confront these biases, challenge prevailing norms, and empower disabled makers to take ownership of their narratives.\n\nThe NAI exists to address the glaring gaps in our industry, providing tangible support and resources to disabled filmmakers. We recognize the importance of creating a platform where their voices can be heard, celebrated, and embraced. Through our funding initiative, data collection, and career development programs, we strive to dismantle the barriers that have hindered disabled filmmakers from fully participating in funding and filmmaker support programs.\n\nThe NAI is committed to supporting disabled nonfiction media makers, through initiatives like the Nonfiction Media Makers with Disabilities Survey. By gathering this data, the NAI hopes to create a targeted fund to help disabled media-makers reclaim their stories, amplify their voices, and reshape the nonfiction form. The survey is a vital component of our mission, as it allows us to listen to the needs and aspirations of disabled nonfiction media makers directly. By understanding their perspectives and challenges, we can tailor our support programs to provide the necessary resources, funding, and professional development opportunities that seek to empower disabled makers.\n\nThe survey also serves as a powerful tool for collective advocacy, informing the industry at large about the experiences of disabled filmmakers and the changes needed to foster a more inclusive and equitable nonfiction landscape. We encourage any who identifies as disabled to participate in the survey, as your insights will play a crucial role in shaping our future initiatives and ensuring that disabled filmmakers are not only heard but actively supported. Diagnosis is not needed to identify as disabled. Please complete the survey if you feel the identity applies to some of your experience.\n\nIt is crucial that we recognize the immense value that disabled filmmakers bring to the nonfiction form. Their unique perspectives challenge our preconceptions, invite empathy, and encourage a deeper understanding of the human experience. By centering their stories, we honor their lived experiences and enrich our collective understanding of diversity and inclusion.\n\nDuring Disability Pride Month, I implore each and every one of you to seek out the works of disabled filmmakers. Take this time to listen to their voices, engage with their narratives, and embrace the power of their storytelling. Help us actively create spaces where disabled filmmakers can thrive, take the helm of their own stories, and contribute to a more authentic and inclusive nonfiction community.\n\nTogether we can dismantle the prevailing structures that have limited the participation of disabled nonfiction media makers and ensure that their stories are told on their own terms. By doing so, we transform our industry and forge a more equitable and empathetic society.\n\nBest,\n\nRanell Shubert\n\nIDA Nonfiction Access Initiative Funds Program Manager\n\nList of documentaries to watch during Disability Pride Month 2023, recommended by the IDA team!\n\nBeing Michelle (Atin Mehra, 2022)\n\nBeing Michelle follows the astounding journey of a deaf and disabled woman who survived incarceration under unimaginable circumstances by a system that refused to accommodate her needs as a deaf person with autism.\n\nBlue (Derek Jarman, 1993)\n\nBlue is a 1993 experimental film directed by Derek Jarman. It is his final feature film, released four months before his death from AIDS-related complications.

Recommended by Keisha Knight.\n\nWhere to Watch: Criteron, Ovid, Metrograph, Kino Now, Kanopy\n\nCrip Camp (James Lebrecht, Nicole Newnham, 2020)\n\nDown the road from Woodstock, a revolution blossomed at a ramshackle summer camp for teenagers with disabilities, transforming their lives and igniting a landmark movement. Recommended by Ranell Shubert.\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\n\nI Didn't See You There (Reid Davenport, 2022)\n\nThe unexpected arrival of a circus tent outside Reid's apartment in Oakland, CA leads him to consider the history and legacy of P.T. Barnum’s Freak Show and its lingering presence in his daily life in the form of gawking, lack of access, and other forms of ableism. The film expands on the tradition of point-of-view cinema by incorporating a disabled aesthetic generated through Davenport's own embodiment. Recommended by Ranell Shubert.\n\nWhere to Watch: PBS\n\nIn My Language (Mel Baggs, 2022)\n\nA short film that brings us into the world of a neuro-divergent filmmaker.
