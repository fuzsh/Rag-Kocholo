        "text": "The plight of special education children, and not ignoring their needs in society as a whole, are the focus of Forget Me Not. This is an unusually moving, gritty, and often frustrating documentary about how parents of special needs children are dealing with getting the best educational opportunities for their children. Families and guardians of children who are considered \"normal,\" general education, or even those whose children have disabilities but are still in the mainstream, typically have little idea how painstakingly difficult it can be to get quality school experiences and assistance for severely disabled youth.\n\nAlthough we hear from a few families, the primary focus is on the unit of Emilio and his parents Hilda and Olivier Bernier. They are middle-class, well-educated parents who want to do what’s best for their young son, who has Down’s Syndrome. The darling little boy’s parents want him to be part of an inclusive classroom, but they are finding it next to impossible to achieve this goal within the New York City Department of Education system.\n\nThis film shows how attitudes toward educating and respecting the needs of special education children (and adults) have evolved from horrible to mediocre or decent, depending on the school district. From the horrifying past of Letchworth and Willowbrook in New York to the mixed reviews of public schools scattered about New York City, suburban Long Island, and elsewhere within the US, viewers learn that there is still much that needs improvement.\n\nWe become intimately involved with Emilio’s family and a few others, who were certainly brave enough to open up their homes to follow their journeys. A key lesson is that families of special needs children need to be their strongest advocates. And this is not easy at all. We see family members in tears, and this isn’t gratuitous.\n\nThis film covers 2016 through 2020, and there are scenes of encouragement (a conference on special education held at the United Nations, a school in Massachusetts that takes seriously the potential of school inclusion) as well as bureaucratic numbness (meetings with evaluators).\n\nThis film will resonate with families going through these situations. It should be essential viewing for those studying to be special education teachers and administrators. It would also be an excellent film for those learning to be general education teachers, especially at the early childhood and elementary levels.\n\nWhat makes the film engaging and more than just a dry investigation is the people we follow. We see little children and teenagers who have Down’s Syndrome, and we understand how their experiences differ. People like to say that no two children are alike, but too often assume that special needs kids are so similar.\n\nThis film is also interesting because it is sort of a travelog of New York City. The city shows itself in positive ways but also sadly negative ways, especially when we learn that the nation’s largest public education system is not doing nearly as much as it can for these children. The levels of bureaucracy are so aggravating.\n\nWe also see evidence that inclusive programs and classrooms benefit the general ed children, and their acceptance of children of various abilities is heartening. If you have ever seen or heard children bullying and belittling special needs peers, it is heartbreaking, and you know that acceptance needs to be taught.\n\nFilm students can also learn a lot from a critical viewing of this film because it shows how a family moves from taking home movies of an expectant mother and her birth and pivoting to a film that shows the journey of a family searching for educational opportunities and acceptance of their son.\n\nSome viewers may wish to skip the early scenes which show the pregnant mother unclothed, and even the birth scene. Do not skip the scene when the doctor explains that the newborn child is being diagnosed as having Down’s Syndrome. The way it occurs so matter of fact is rather upsetting. The mood turns from joyous to anxious so harshly.\n\nThere are also chilling scenes of the former homes for the disabled, and archival footage of the infamous Willowbrook expose by Geraldo Rivera.\n\nThis film resonated deeply with me, as I am a product of New York City public schools, taught for over 18 years in them, and have two daughters who went through the system as well.\n\nThis is a memorable and touching documentary that can be appreciated by all types of viewers, especially those with open minds. In many ways, our attitudes toward those with disabilities, especially intellectual and emotional, have evolved. But there is so much more that needs to be changed. Budget allocations will continue to be a battleground. And many people still overlook or even denigrate the needs of these students and citizens. Forget Me Not hopefully will make more people cognizant of these issues.\n\nWhat academic subjects would this documentary be suitable for?\n\nThis film would be suitable for undergraduate and graduate level courses on special education; for undergraduate and graduate courses on caring for special needs children (psychology and sociology)\n\nWhat library education programs would this documentary fit?\n\nThis would be suitable for a family/guardian forum on special education; a conference on problems in public education; a program about supporting families who have a special needs child\n\nIs this film appropriate for a public screening?\n\nAudiences will be upset to some extent but could also be motivated to speak up about the systemic problems we face when educating special needs children, and how people deal with the bureaucracy. A daring school board could show this for discussion on how to improve the opportunities for special needs children and for inclusion."
