        "text": "The first episode of our fifth season of DOK Industry Podcast is out! Seven new episodes will be released in the run-up to the festival in autumn, all created and produced in collaboration with the Programmers of Colour Collective (POC2) and What's Up With Docs Podcast.\n\nAs in our previous seasons, we will continue exploring burning issues in the documentary film industry with a special focus on power structures and lack of representation as well as offering pathways into criticism, alternative perspectives and works from filmmakers, curators, artists and writers from marginalised groups. The podcast strives to act as a platform where listeners explore the nuances of a complex reality, engage, empathise and seek courage through truthful conversations between sparring partners. Read more in the press release\n\nThe Curators\n\nof this year’s DOK Industry Podcast are Lucy Mukerjee, Themba Bhebhe, Toni Bell, Weronika Lewandowska, Shakira Refos, Meena Nanji, Sunil Sadarangani, Judy Kibinge, Mungai Kiroga, Emily Rogers, Erika Dilday and P. Mudamba Mudamba.\n\nIn the First Episode\n\nShakira Refos talks to Lanaa Dantzler, scriptwriter, filmmaker and alumna of the Black Girls Film Camp, about her experience in the training programme, the impact on her professional and personal journey and how she envisions her future as an emerging filmmaker in the film industry. The camp provides a mentorship programme where young Black women seek support in a dedicated, safe space for producing a (first) short film. The conversation continues with filmmaker Contessa Gayles stretching out more insights about the importance of pipeline programmes such as fellowships, art residencies and labs and how to find empowerment and success outside academia.\n\nFurther Episodes\n\nof season 5 will focus on the filmmaking industry in India, present DOCUBOX, a Kenyan initiative that has been a dynamic hub supporting filmmakers from the region for more than ten years, and examine initiatives from Cameroon and the United States for creating discursive spaces for films outside the commercial structures.\n\nDOK Industry Podcast is supported by Docs in Orbit, a podcast hosted by a community of international filmmakers, and film.macht.kritisch. – The Podcast about the *Other* Cinema from programmer Canan Turan.\n\nTune in to episode 1 – “The Power of the Pipeline”\n\nFrom 25 July to 14 August we’ll present film highlights and audience favourites from the last festival editions on four evenings in three of Leipzig’s open-air cinemas.\n\nSummer cinema at the Plagwitzer Markthalle (in cooperation with Schaubühne Lindenfels)\n\nOn 25 July, we’ll open with the thrilling true crime story of “The Gullspång Miracle”: While buying an apartment, a pair of siblings meet a woman who looks exactly like their dead sister. But is she really their relative?\n\nOn 1 August, travel to the Italian Adriatic with “Vista Mare” and sneak an unvarnished look behind the façade of the “carefree” beach holiday, where seasonal workers toil for the holidaymakers.\n\nOpen-Air cinema at the Spinnerei (in cooperation with Luru Kino)\n\nThe Golden Dove of DOK Leipzig 2022 returns to this city on 11 August! Theo Montoya’s “Anhell69” tells a real-life ghost story of a young, queer generation in a Colombia marked by violence and repression – in atmospheric and morbid images.\n\n2cl Sommerkino at Conne Island (in cooperation with the Cinèmatheque)\n\nThe finale of our summer cinema brings “Vika!” on 14 August. She’s a DJ, 84 years old and a star of Warsaw’s nightclubs. Agnieszka Zwiefka’s portrait deconstructs the borders between the “acceptable” and “unacceptable” roles of a woman who refuses to acknowledge her age.\n\nYou can get tickets via the respective cinema partner and at the box office. We’re looking forward to your visit and to summer cinema nights together!\n\nWe’re excited to launch two calls for producers today!\n\nDOK Co-Pro Market\n\nProducers, we can't wait to discover your new projects for DOK Co-Pro Market 2024! This two-day co-financing and networking event, connects producers with potential co-production partners, broadcasters, funders and distributors to co-finance and collaborate on new creative documentary projects. In 850+ individual meetings, 35 carefully selected projects are matched with international producers, decision makers and financiers.\n\nGain valuable insights into the international and German non-fiction markets through an accompanying programme of discussions, case-studies and talks.\n\nApply by 15 July\n\nAnimation Lab DOK Leipzig\n\nWe’ll team up again with CEE Animation for Animation Lab DOK Leipzig! This is a four-day residential workshop dedicated to professional producers who are developing their first animated documentary of any format (short, series, feature) and are interested in exploring the landscape of the animation industry. The programme tackles topics such as project development, production and distribution.\n\nThe workshop event will take place from 28 October to 1 November 2024 in Leipzig, alongside the DOK Industry Programme.
