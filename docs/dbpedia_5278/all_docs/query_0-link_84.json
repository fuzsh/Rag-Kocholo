With a faculty whose distinctions include three Pulitzer Prizes and numerous other national and international awards, the School offers 22 majors and 39 minors that include those in traditional disciplines, languages other than English, and interdisciplinary areas of study.\n\nThe core educational mission of the humanities is imparting to students tools of analysis that will allow them to understand, describe, and explain the world around them in a critical context. A liberal arts education in the humanities prepares students to examine a variety of written and visual forms and to communicate effectively. All Humanities students are introduced to writing, philosophy, history, visual culture, literature, and a language other than English. Students in Humanities majors are given the opportunity to conduct an intensive conversation with the traditions, both past and present; and as a result, develop the ability to understand and make sense of other people and their cultures. Humanistic inquiry equips students to enter the world as globally thinking citizens.\n\nBecause language is the humanist’s essential tool and the traditional medium of historical record, philosophical deliberation, and literary creation and criticism, the School of Humanities places special emphasis on language and training in composition. The School offers programs in more than a dozen languages other than English. The serious study of language other than English is crucial to fostering critical thinking, objective self-reflection, and international awareness. The distinguished programs in creative writing, literary journalism, and the Program in Global Languages and Communication are housed in Humanities. Humanities Core integrates the multi-disciplinary study of the humanities along with lower-division writing for majors who enter as freshmen.\n\nInterdisciplinary study is an essential feature of the Humanities Honors Program as well as of many of the School's undergraduate degree programs. Examples of undergraduate programs located in Humanities that cut across disciplinary boundaries are the majors in Global Cultures, Global Middle East Studies, and Religious Studies, and the interdisciplinary minors in Archaeology, Latin American Studies, and Medical Humanities.\n\nStudents majoring in the humanities are particularly well-prepared for careers in all fields that rely on analysis, judgment, argument, and communication. Humanities students have moved into business, medicine, the law, education, politics, public policy, academia, new media and journalism. Employers in all sectors increasingly request college graduates who can communicate effectively across cultures, think critically, and have the ability to learn and adapt on the job. Employers can provide a specific form of technical training, but the School of Humanities provides the thinking and writing skills, as well as the social and emotional intelligence that allow graduates to excel in a wide range of professions.\n\nHumanities Office of Undergraduate Study\n\nYong Chen, Associate Dean for Curriculum and Student Services\n\n143 Humanities Instructional Building\n\n949-824-5132\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad\n\nThe Office of Undergraduate Study provides academic counseling to students pursuing majors within the School of Humanities, as well as students interested in changing to, or adding a double major in School of Humanities disciplines. Students should consult an academic counselor with questions about University policies and regulations, degree requirements, course content, options for majors and minors, study abroad, honors opportunities, or when facing academic difficulties.\n\nHumanities Office of Graduate Study\n\nYong Chen, Associate Dean for Curriculum and Student Services\n\n143 Humanities Instructional Building\n\nThe School of Humanities offers graduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as in interdisciplinary programs. The School’s graduate programs are generally aimed at those pursuing a Ph.D., with the Master’s degree awarded along the way. Exceptions are the standalone M.A. programs offered in the Department of English, the Department of European Languages and Studies, and the Department of History. For current UCI undergraduate students, the School offers three 4+1 M.A. programs (B.A. and M.A. in five years) in Art History, Asian American Studies, and European Thought and Culture. In addition, the Department of English administers the M.F.A. Program in Writing (Fiction/Poetry).\n\nThe School of Humanities houses seven graduate emphases that may be pursued in conjunction with study toward the doctorate: Asian American Studies, Critical Theory, Feminist Studies, Film and Media Studies, Latin American Studies, Medical Humanities, and Visual Studies. In addition, the School also offers graduate specializations in Ancient Iran and the Premodern Persianate World and Persian/Iranian Studies.\n\nGraduate students participate in the affairs of the School of Humanities by serving as representatives on various departmental, school-wide, and campus-wide committees.\n\nHonors at Graduation\n\nCampus criteria for honors at graduation are described in the section Honors Recognition. In addition to campus criteria, the School of Humanities uses cumulative GPA as the criterion for the awarding of Honors at Graduation. The official designation of Honors on the diploma and transcript will be based upon the candidate’s cumulative GPA and total units completed at the end of the final quarter.\n\nHumanities Honors Program\n\nJeffrey Wasserstrom, Director\n\n143 Humanities Instructional Building\n\n949-824-5132; humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/opportunities/honors\n\nThe Honors Program within the School of Humanities is a two-year, upper-division program designed to challenge exceptional students from all majors by providing special opportunities for intellectual growth in an interdisciplinary setting. Honors students benefit from small seminars, individual faculty attention, peer support, and the chance to pursue independent research. They think deeply about the meaning and value of humanistic inquiry and thus actively shape its future while honing their skills as thinkers, writers, and citizens of the world.\n\nHumanities Honors students complete a two-part course of study. In their junior year, students take three quarters of an interdisciplinary Proseminar (HUMAN H120) organized around a single topic or problem, such as the borders of human life, crime and punishment, state and civil society, vision and visibility, or the current theme, \"Stories That Matter: Narratives of Past and Present.\" The sequence is designed to compare and contrast modes of analysis and critical thinking in several disciplines in the Humanities, such as history, literary studies, and philosophy. In a small seminar setting, students are encouraged to become reflective about their own chosen disciplines.\n\nIn their senior year, students take a sequence of courses beginning in the fall with a Senior Honors Seminar (HUMAN H140), and continuing in the winter and spring with the Senior Honors Thesis (HUMAN H141) and the Senior Honors Colloquium (HUMAN H142W), in which they complete an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. A prize is awarded for the year’s outstanding thesis.\n\nIn both sequences, the Honors students benefit from their close association with exceptional scholars and the challenge and support of their intellectual peers.\n\nStudents interested in learning how the Humanities Honors Program will fit into their regular courses of study are encouraged to contact the Humanities Office of Undergraduate Study.\n\nHumanities Experiential Learning\n\nThe School of Humanities offers experiential learning opportunities and programs that enrich and support undergraduate educational experiences and are complementary to classroom learning. These include internship preparation; career development classes and workshops; opportunities for mentored and sponsored undergraduate research and presentations at UCI and beyond; digital project work; study abroad; and support and preparation for graduate and professional school application.\n\nThe Director of Experiential Learning is a dedicated staff position within the school who runs associated programming and serves as a point of contact for Humanities majors interested in developing strong professional portfolios and participating in quality educational experiences.\n\nHumanities majors interested in learning more about experiential learning and career development opportunities should contact humcareerdevelopment@uci.edu and visit www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/opportunities-experiential-learning.\n\nHumanities Peer Mentor Program\n\nThe Humanities Peer Mentor Program is designed to address some of the academic, cultural, and social needs of freshmen in the School of Humanities. While all new Humanities freshmen will benefit from participation in the program, it is particularly useful for new first generation college students. It has a goal of developing leadership skills in both the mentors and the proteges/mentees. The program features two-tiered mentoring, with successful upper-division students mentoring small groups of new students, and the student mentors in turn working with faculty and staff. Another focus of the program is to encourage the student mentors to go on to graduate school.\n\nParticipants attend workshops on topics such as communication styles, study skills, procrastination and time management, the imposter syndrome, etc., as well as take part in a variety of more social events. They also produce weekly journals in which they express their ideas and raise issues for their mentors. For additional information, contact the Humanities Office of Undergraduate Study.\n\nSchool of Humanities Research Centers\n\nCenter for Critical Korean Studies\n\nJoseph Jonghyun Jeon, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/UCICCKS\n\nccks@uci.edu\n\nIn response to a surging interest in contemporary Korean popular culture and society among students and to leverage UCI’s faculty strengths in Korean studies, the Center for Critical Korean Studies develops innovative interdisciplinary programs, provides research grants for cutting-edge book monographs and essays, hires leading postdoctoral students in critical Korean studies, and invites Korean studies scholars from around the globe to share their research. The Center’s focus on critical studies draws upon UCI’s strengths and reputation in critical theory, which is an interdisciplinary field of study focused on examining the political, cultural, economic and social relationships within a culture or field of study. CCKS focuses on producing Korea-specific critical theory as it relates to race, borders, ecology and contemporary popular culture. It promotes activities about learning to read and write Korean, to think critically about Korea’s relationship to the Pacific Rim region and consequently to the world, and to develop a deeper historical understanding of Korea. Such understanding of the important theories and practices of Korean studies, the Center feels, are critical to the broader understanding of the current globalization and its effects.\n\nCenter for Jewish Studies\n\nJeffrey Kopstein, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/jewishstudies\n\njewishstudies@uci.edu\n\nJewish learning starts with questions. At the Center for Jewish Studies we provide a robust environment for meaningful understanding of the multiple ways in which Judaism and the Jewish people have shaped, and are shaping, human experience in all its facets—past, present, and future. Here scholars and students explore the diverse range of lived experiences and textual traditions of Jews as they are articulated in various regions throughout the world. Our faculty and students come from cross campus and many different Departments, including History, English Comparative Literature, Political Science, Spanish & Portuguese, Philosophy, European Studies, and Classics.\n\nCenter for Latin American and Caribbean Studies\n\nHoracio Legras, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/las\n\nlasc@uci.edu\n\nThe Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies brings together an active group of faculty and students who promote dialogue and collaboration in the study of Latin America across disciplinary boundaries and organize educational activities on Latin America. The center hopes to further engage the Orange County communities of Latin American ancestry and heritage through public programs, conferences, film screenings, and musical events that examine the history and cultures of Latin America as well as the influence of Latin America in the United States and the world. The Department of Spanish and Portuguese administers a minor and a graduate emphasis in Latin American Studies.\n\nCenter for Liberation, Anti-Racism, and Belonging\n\nJudy Tzu-Chun Wu, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/CLAB\n\nj.wu@uci.edu\n\nC-LAB fosters research communities that analyze race, Indigeneity and migration. C-LAB will identify research questions, explore methodologies and experiment with diverse publication dissemination methods that bring attention to and work towards social justice. In other words, C-LAB seeks to create a research justice university.\n\nCenter for Medical Humanities\n\nKelli Sharp, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/centermedicalhumanities\n\nmedicalhumanities@uci.edu\n\nThe UCI Center for Medical Humanities explores dimensions of human embodiment, especially those that relate to illness, disability, and other experiences of bodyminds. An institutional collaboration between the School of Medicine, School of Humanities, and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts, the Center brings together faculty and student scholars, clinicians and policy makers, and key community stakeholders to explore the arcs of living and dying and everything in between from a range of disciplinary perspectives. These perspectives span from the creative and performative arts, textual and visual representations, systems of belief and philosophical orientations, to clinical practice and health sciences. The Center’s scope also takes up questions of stigma and other social pressures on those considered differently abled. This commitment to broad forms of human vulnerability enables deeper appreciation of the ways by which people, communities and spaces make meaning out of different experiences of embodiment, of their own and of others. The Center promotes research and creative activity, supports teaching and learning, and sustains engagement between the campus and the diverse communities served by UCI in the southern California region.\n\nInternational Center for Writing and Translation\n\nJerry Lee, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/icwt\n\nicwt@uci.edu\n\nUCI’s International Center for Writing and Translation, founded in 2002, has for more than 20 years served as an important space for the promotion of literary, creative, linguistic, and philosophical translation. We encourage you to learn more about the ICWT’s various initiatives, events, and fellowship opportunities. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, the Founding Director of the International Center for Writing and Translation, wrote that “translation is the language of languages.” Translation is capable of forging new bonds and awakening new understandings; it is also capable of inciting critical social change. Join us in celebrating the promise of writing and thinking across languages.\n\nSamuel Jordan Center for Persian Studies and Culture\n\nTouraj Daryaee, Director\n\nwww.humanities.uci.edu/persianstudies\n\namoknat@uci.edu\n\nThe Samuel Jordan Center for Persian Studies and Culture is devoted to the study of Iran and the Persianate world. Drawing on the strengths of the entire campus, the Center focuses on interdisciplinary research projects that bridge the arts, humanities, engineering, medicine, and the sciences. The Center sponsors events such as lectures, performances, and film screenings that draw a campus and community audience throughout the year. Courses, including language, literature, history, art history, music, and culture at the undergraduate and graduate levels, are the backbone of the Center’s academic and pedagogical mission. These academic courses are offered by affiliated faculty and administered by different units. The Program in Global Languages and Communication offers courses on Persian language. Courses in ancient, medieval, and modern Persian history are administered by the Department of History. Courses on modern Persian literature and the literature of Iranian diaspora are offered through the Department of Comparative Literature. Courses on the art history and archaeology of ancient Iran and Iranian visual culture are available through the Department of Art History. And courses on Persian music are housed within the Department of Music. A list of courses and information on the Persian Studies minor is available on the minor’s website. Information about the Graduate Specializations in Ancient Iran and the Premodern Persian World and Persian/Iranian Studies is available on the Humanities website.\n\nLanguage Other than English Placement and Progression\n\nThe following policies apply to all UCI students taking language other than English courses.\n\nLanguage Other Than English Progression. Within the beginning and intermediate language instructional sequences (1A-B-C and 2A-B-C, and for Latin and Greek, 1A-B-C and 100) students must earn a grade of at least C (or Pass) in order to advance to the next level of instruction, unless an exception is permitted by the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean of Humanities for Curriculum and Student Services. A student may not go back and take a lower-level course for credit once a more advanced level has been completed with a passing grade. Nor may a student be enrolled in more than one level of the same language at the same time (for example, a student may not enroll in language 2B and 2C concurrently).\n\nLanguage Other Than English Placement. Placement tests are required for the following languages: Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Contact the UCI Academic Testing Center for information or to register for an exam. Placement tests are recommended but not required for French and German language courses. The purpose of placement testing is to ensure success in UCI language courses.\n\nFor languages other than English which are not listed above (and for French and German if the placement test is not taken), students entering UCI with previous high school language training only are placed as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school language other than English will normally enroll in 1B-, 1C-, 2A-, or 2B-level language courses, respectively. Students who opt to “go back” one quarter will earn credit (i.e., a student with three years of high school language other than English may opt to take 1C instead of 2A). If it has been five or more years since the last high school course, the student may begin at 1A for credit. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean of Humanities for Curriculum and Student Services.\n\nStudents will not receive credit for repeating at UCI language other than English courses for which they received transfer credit from another institution, even if they are placed by testing into the equivalent of a previously taken course.\n\nIf a student is exempted from a language course required in a Humanities major or minor, an approved course must be completed in place of the exempted course.\n\nLanguage Other Than English Advanced Placement Credit. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Placement credit. However, since Advanced Placement awards a maximum of 8 units for scores of 4 and 5, students may elect to take 2C or the equivalent for credit.\n\nNative Speakers of Languages Other Than English. A native speaker of a language other than English is defined by the University as someone who attended the equivalent of secondary school in another country where the language of instruction was other than English. Students with prior background in a language other than English should consult the UCI Academic Testing Center to see if a placement test is available to demonstrate competence in that language. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, or equivalent, of one year of formal schooling at the 10th-grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the School of Humanities Language Other Than English requirement equal to second-year language. Appropriate documentation and translation, when necessary, must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. For some majors offered by the School of Humanities, students may be exempted from taking third-year language study in that language. In this case, the student must substitute appropriate upper-division courses in the major to replace the number of exempted courses. For example, if a native speaker of Japanese is exempted from JAPANSE 103C, that student must replace the course with an upper-division course on a Japanese topic offered by the Department of East Asian Studies."
