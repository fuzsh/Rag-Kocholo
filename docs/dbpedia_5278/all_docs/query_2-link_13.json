        "text": "Worthwhile early documentary from Herzog exploring the different treatment accorded to the disabled in Germany and the USA. Given the then fairly recent history of Germany there are resonances in this film that will not have been lost on its original audience.\n\nCertainly at the time the film was made disabled rights were decades ahead in the US; among other things this is a powerful and compassionate campaigning documentary.\n\nSee it with \"Land of Silence and Darkness\" if you can. The two films, made in the same year, share a lot and in fact I believe the making of the second flowed directly from the first.\n\n9 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?
