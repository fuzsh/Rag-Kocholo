        "text": "The indie film “Daruma” — which illustrates the importance of authentic casting with disabled actors — will hold its world premiere June 28, just a few days before the start of Disability Pride Month.\n\nThe film is part of the Dances With Films Festival, which runs June 22-July 2 at the TCL Chinese theaters in Hollywood.\n\nThe festival, in its 26th year, also will screen three documentaries about disabilities: “Abled,” directed by Einar Thorsteinsson about Paralympian Blake Leeper; “Baldy for the Blind” (producer-director Drea Castro), centering on a group of blind hikers attempting to climb Mt. Baldy; and “You Have No Idea” (director Alexander Jeffery), concerning a woman trying to get treatment for her autistic son.\n\nThere is also the short “Leak,” from writer-director Jordan Martin, a dystopian drama about a man and his deaf mother.\n\n“Daruma,” directed by Alexander Yellen and written by Kelli McNeil-Yellen, is a character study of two friends driving across the country with one man’s young daughter. It stars Tobias Forrest and John W. Lawson, respectively a wheelchair-user and a double amputee, but their disabilities are incidental to the plot.\n\nMost mainstream films about disabled people feature name actors in the lead roles but director-cinematographer Yellen tells Variety, “We chose a different path by building our film around two authentically cast leads. This meant having to produce the film completely independently but ultimately I believe we have a better product for it.” The festival screening sold out quickly and he hopes the film “will validate our model for other filmmakers hoping to tell similar stories.”\n\nCo-writer-producer McNeil-Yellen adds that there is a huge untapped market for similar works. “There’s an audience demanding to see content like this and the right partners, the smart partners, are going to see the value a film like ‘Daruma’ adds to their bottom line.”\n\nThe six screening rooms at TCL Chinese are wheelchair-accessible and festival founders Leslee Scallon and Michael Trent say a number of the films will be shown with descriptive audio headsets, subtitles and ASL interpreters.\n\nThe festival’s features-programming chair Ariana Farina said there has been an uptick in the number of disability-themed films in recent years. “These films have done incredibly well at the festival and beyond, oftentimes with sell-out screenings. I am hoping this is an indication of a recent shift in the industry funding and supporting more projects by disabled filmmakers.”\n\nApple TV+ film “CODA” broke barriers when it won the Oscar for best pic, but so far, there hasn’t yet been a flood of similar films. This year’s Hollywood fare includes “Champions,” directed by Bobby Farrelly, which Focus Features opened in March, with Woody Harrelson as a coach of a team with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe Sony release “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” includes work by actor-activist Nic Novicki (voicing Lego Spider-Man) and by Danielle Perez, voicing Sun Spider, who uses a mobility device. The film’s co-writers and producers, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, have been longtime advocates of hiring the disabled, as have the Farrelly brothers.\n\nAlso in a limited theatrical release and streaming is “Unidentified Objects,” starring Matthew Jeffers."
