        "text": "showcasing 109 films from 51 countries\n\nDOK.fest München is Germany's largest documentary film festival showcasing the highlights of current documentary filmmaking – at the main event in May and throughout the year. Anually in May the festival presents about 110 international documentary films on the big screen at 20 partner venues in the centre of Munich. The programme is divided into four main competitions and nine series. After two online editions, the festival has been held as a dual event since 2022: on the big screen in the cinema as well as on the digital screen @home. The 39th edition is scheduled for May 1-12 in cinemas and additional May 6-20 @home with selectied films online throughout Germany. Browse the full programme here and stay tuned FB.\n\nEvery year, the programme brings together a selection of the most outstanding current international documentary films. The festival presents the highlights of documentary filmmaking and at the same time is guided by a clear curatorial signature. Three main competitions are at the heart of the programme: DOK.international Main Competition, DOK.deutsch Competition and DOK.horizonte – Cinema of Urgency. With the Student Award and the FFF Talent Award Documentary Film, we also present two relevant prizes for up-and-coming filmmakers. In the programme sections DOK.panorama, Best of Fests, DOK.music, Munich Premieres, DOK.4teens and In Memoriam, the festival presents numerous specials, often in cooperation with selected partners from art, culture and society in Munich and beyond.\n\nThe award winning german documentaries are:\n\nVIKTOR DOK.international:\n\nJOHATSU – INTO THIN AIR | JOHATSU – DIE SICH IN LUFT AUFLÖSEN by Andreas Hartmann, Arata Mori, 86min, WS: CAT&Docs, D: RFF – Real Fiction Filmverleih, P: Ossa Film, [Main Competition]\n\nJury statement: \"Picking one out of so many beautifully and impressively told stories was not an easy task, and we would like to congratulate all of the competition filmmakers on making such important and impactful work. We decided to award a film that introduced us to a world and issues we didn’t know existed. One that did so in a deeply empathetic and moving way, while also taking us on an immersive cinematic journey with its intimate – yet far from intrusive – camerawork and evocative music. The filmmakers successfully wove together very complex stories of loneliness, despair and shame – without any sense of judgment, and instead with deep respect for individual human experiences. It's a unique and delicately crafted film that moved and surprised us, and we hope it will be seen and appreciated by audiences around the world. The VIKTOR award in the section Main Competition DOK.international goes to: JOHATSU – INTO THIN AIR by Andreas Hartmann and Arata Mori. Congratulations!\"\n\nVIKTOR DOK.horizonte Competition – Cinema of Urgency:\n\nKAMAY by Ilyas Yourish, Shahrokh Bikaran, 105min, WS: CAT&Docs, P: Clin d'oeil films, ROW Pictures, [DOK.horizonte]\n\nJury statement: \"We would like to reward a previously untold story that sheds light on the heartbreaking events that take place in one family, reflecting the drama of a whole ethnic group. The directors carefully guide the viewer through the grief of the family members, revealing the roots of hundreds of years of oppression. The two directors of KAMAY, llyas Yourish and Shahrokh Bikaran, are also searching for a unique cinematic language to preserve and represent the culture of the Hazara people and find a considerate and poetic way to make their voices heard. We appreciate their respectful approach towards the sensitive subject matter and the protagonists, who find themselves in a vulnerable position, as well as the directors’ brave attempt to expose the issues standing in the way of achieving justice for the protagonists’ daughter. We hope that this film will help raise awareness about the current situation in Afghanistan and give more attention to and space for the voices of refugees from the region. Congratulations!\"\n\nFFF-Förderpreis Dokumentarfilm:\n\nEXILE NEVER ENDS by Bahar Bektas, 100min, P: Pink Shadow Films, [Filmmaking in Exile]\n\nJury statement: \"It is rare for a documentary to capture the full complexity of the experience of exile. EXILE NEVER ENDS is a remarkable exception because it explores two exiles: of a Kurdish family, who fled persecution from Turkey to Germany, and of the two sons who question their relationship with the country they grew up in. It touches on issues such as generational conflict and the challenges of integration without following an agenda of its own. This multi-layered, intimate story is told by Bahar Bektas, who sensitively traces the complex emotions of her family members, while asserting a space of her own, as she delves into the emotional and geographical realms of displacement and new beginnings. The jury was unanimous in recognising the sensitivity and exploration demonstrated by a very talented director. Congratulations!\"\n\nmegaherz Student Award:\n\nHAUSNUMMER NULL by Lilith Kugler, 90min, P: now films, Torero Film, Filmuniversität Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF, [Student Award]\n\nJury statement: \"We, the Student Award jury, have chosen a film that touched us from the very first shot, captivated us for 95 minutes in the darkness of the cinema and has not let go ever since. HAUSNUMMER NULL is a courageous film that focuses closely and with a clear view on its protagonist, but also accompanies the important supporting characters through harsh reality with a loving eye. It is an important film because it really engages with this harsh reality that others only glimpse at. And it is also a beautiful film because the camera repeatedly finds images and perspectives that fascinate and gently guide our gaze. Working as a filmmaker also means constantly developing a method to do the subject and the protagonists justice. Maintaining integrity, going where others look away, having confidence in your own project and never losing it: the director has achieved all of this. We congratulate Lilith Kugler on winning the Student Award 2024 for her film HAUSNUMMER NULL.\"\n\nkinokino Audience Award\n\nHIS PARENTS | JENSEITS VON SCHULD by Katharina Köster, Katrin Nemec, 79min, P: Trimafilm, D: RFF – Realfiction Filmverleih, [DOK.deutsch Competition]\n\nThe media call their son the 'patient killer.' He was given a life sentence for his numerous crimes. Life goes on for his parents Ulla and Didi Högel but nothing is the same as before. They must accept the bitter truth, figure out how to cope with everyday life and reposition themselves in relation to their child. A compelling, precisely observed film about parenthood and love. [39 DOK.fest München catalogue, Ysabel Fantou]\n\nAND\n\nVFF Documentary Film Production Award :\n\nVENEZUELA: COUNTRY OF LOST CHILDREN | LAND DER VERLORENEN KINDER by Juan Camilo Cruz, Marc Wiese. P: Dreamer Joint Venture Filmproduktion GmbH. [DOK.panorama]\n\nFrom the jury statement: \"It is impressive to see the adverse conditions under which Oliver Stoltz and his team made this film: Without the protection of a gang of youths, filming on location would have been too dangerous; professional camera equipment had to be smuggled in over the border. In a country where foreign camera teams are monitored at every turn, a project like this can only succeed with the utmost conspiracy. To this end, the producer used a local crew. Oliver Stoltz has proven to have nerves of steel and deserves public recognition for the successful completion of this film: in this case, the VFF Documentary Film Production Award 2024.\"\n\nGerman Documentary Film Music Award:\n\nMY STOLEN PLANET by Farahnaz Sharifi, P: JYOTI Film, Pak Film, WS: CAT&Docs, [Filmmaking in Exile]\n\nFrom the jury statement: \"The film music by Atena Eshtiaghi (*1989 in Iran) is particularly effective because of what it does not do. She avoids the conventions of illustrative film music and instead uses silence as a stylistic device for this equally radical and personal film by Farahnaz Sharif. The director’s private video archive of old Super 8 recordings, edited together with footage of current demonstrations, is highly politically charged against the backdrop of the comprehensive ban on images in Iran. Atena Eshtiaghi gives strong expression to these messages of uncensored life by accompanying the images with minimalist patterns rather than pathetically exaggerating them.

This year's award goes to producer Oliver Stoltz for the documentary VENEZUELA: COUNTRY OF LOST CHILDREN | LAND DER VERLORENEN KINDER by directors Juan Camilo Cruz and Marc Wiese. Oliver Stoltz produced the film with his company Dreamer Joint Venture Filmproduktion GmbH. From the jury statement: \"It is impressive to see the adverse conditions under which Oliver Stoltz and his team made this film: Without the protection of a gang of youths, filming on location would have been too dangerous; professional camera equipment had to be smuggled in over the border. In a country where foreign camera teams are monitored at every turn, a project like this can only succeed with the utmost conspiracy. To this end, the producer used a local crew. Oliver Stoltz has proven to have nerves of steel and deserves public recognition for the successful completion of this film: in this case, the VFF Documentary Film Production Award 2024.\"\n\nThe award ceremony and the German premiere of VENEZUELA: COUNTRY OF LOST CHILDREN | LAND DER VERLORENEN KINDER will take place on Tuesday, 7 May at HFF Munich.\n\nNominees are the following films with outstanding creative significance of the production:\n\nBLACK WATER GREEN GOLD by Axel Javier Sulzbacher, Producer: Axel Javier Sulzbacher, Tzintzuni Studio,\n\nTHE GIRLS WHO RIDE DRAGONS by Peyman Ghalambor, Producer: Peyman Ghalambor,\n\nHIS PARENTS (WT: BEYOND GUILT) | JENSEITS VON SCHULD by Katharina Köster, Katrin Nemec, Producer: Isabelle Bertolone, David Armati Lechner, Trini Götze, Trimafilm,\n\nPOLIZEIAKADEMIE – POLICE ACADEMY BERLIN by Moritz Schulz, Producer: Maximilian Becht, Kojoten Filmproduktion,\n\nDIE WELT AUF RÄDERN by Felix Rudolph, Producer: Fabian Schwarz, Comoedia Mundi e.V.,\n\nVENEZUELA: COUNTRY OF LOST CHILDREN | LAND DER VERLORENEN KINDER by Juan Camilo Cruz, 93min, Producer: Oliver Stoltz, Dreamer Joint Venture Filmproduktion GmbH,\n\nWATCHING YOU – THE WORLD OF PALANTIR AND ALEX KARP | WATCHING YOU – DIE WELT VON PALANTIR UND ALEX KARP by Klaus Stern, 99min, Producer Klaus Stern, Sternfilm, WS: RISE AND SHINE, [OPENING]\n\nDOK.edit Award is endowed with € 5000.- and aims to shed light on the post-production of documentaries and to honor the work of editors.

The award is endowed with € 5,000.- and is sponsored by Versicherungskammer Kulturstiftung. And the winner 2024 is Atena Eshtiaghi for original score of MY STOLEN PLANET by Farahnaz Sharifi. The award ceremony, incuding the screening of the film, is scheduled for May 5, 2024, 8 p.m. at HFF Munich.\n\nFrom the jury statement: \"The film music avoids the conventions of illustrative film music and instead uses silence as a stylistic device for this equally radical and personal film. Atena Eshtiaghi gives strong expression to the messages of uncensored life by accompanying the images with minimalist patterns rather than pathetically exaggerating them. This creates a sense of distance and, at the same time, creates periods of time in which a great sadness is inscribed. Eshtiaghi's music does not coat the film in a pleasing rhythm, rather it emphasises the heterogeneity and creates a resonance space for what the film is about through its precise texture: Isolation, resistance, hope.\"\n\nGERMAN DOCUMENTARY FILM MUSIC AWARD 2024 NOMINEES ARE:\n\nHARRAGA – THOSE WHO BURN THEIR LIVES by Benjamin Rost, 86min, Composer: Alexander Vicar, P: MSZ // Production & Consulting,\n\nHOLLYWOODGATE by Ibrahim Nash’at, Composer: Volker Bertelmann, WS: Cinephil,\n\nIN WOLF COUNTRY | IM LAND DER WÖLFE by Ralf Bücheler, 102min, Composer: Cico Beck, WS: RISE AND SHINE, P: if… Productions, D: mindjazz pictures,\n\nJOHATSU – INTO THIN AIR by Andreas Hartmann, Arata Mori, 86min, Copposer: Jana Irmert, D: RFF – Real Fiction Filmverleih, WS: CAT&Docs, P: Ossa Film | Andreas Hartmann,\n\nMY STOLEN PLANET by Farahnaz Sharifi, Composer: Atena Eshtiaghi, P: JYOTI Film, Pak Film, WS: CAT&Docs,\n\nTHE THIRD BROTHER | DER DRITTE BRUDER by Kathrin Jahrreiss, 110min, Composer: Julia Klomfass, P: Ester.Reglin.Film,\n\nWATCHING YOU: THE WORLD OF PALANTIR AND ALEX KARP | WATCHING YOU: DIE WELT VON PALANTIR UND ALEX KARP by Klaus Stern, Composer: Michael Kadelbach, WS: RISE AND SHINE,\n\nas well as the Swiss production\n\nE.1027 – EILEEN GRAY AND THE HOUSE BY THE SEA by Beatrice Minger, Christoph Schaub, Composer: Peter Scherer, P: Das Kollektiv für audiovisuelle Werke, soap factory,\n\nMay 1–7, 2024\n\nDOK.forum – The Industry Platform of DOK.fest München.\n\nThink tank for the documentary film industry and platform for projects in the development process.\n\nBrowse all award winners DOK.forum 2024 here.\n\nIn panels, workshops and other public events, the DOK.forum Perspectives invite you to develop visions and impulses for the future of documentary film and to explore relevant questions of media policy.\n\nAs a market for co-creation and co-production, the DOK.forum Marketplace offers various formats for the further development and realisation of new documentary film projects.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the DOK.forum has established itself as a fixed meeting place and relevant networking opportunity for the German-speaking industry – with a growing range of offers for international filmmakers.\n\nAmong the seven Master's Pitch projects are two German (co)productions:\n\nSILENT WAR by the directors and producers Dirk van den Berg, OutreMer Film, Berlin & Pascal Verroust K2 Productions, Paris. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, over 2000 nuclear devices have detonated on Earth, labeled as \"tests.\" This film unveils Prof. Robert Jacobs’ groundbreaking research of the Cold War's darkest secret: all nuclear powers ruthlessly experimented on their people, weaving a decades-long tale of deception and lies with countless victims, in a SILENT WAR.\n\nOUR SISTER ANGELA – BLACK POWER IN THE GDR by Katharina Warda and Jascha Hannover, producer André Schäfer, Florianfilm GmbH, In the 1970s, an enthusiastic solidarity movement for Black civil rights activist Angela Davis emerges in the GDR. She attracts tens of thousands of people during her visits to the country. But all this enthusiasm is deceptive. Co-director Katharina Warda tells this often-overlooked piece of Black East German history from her personal perspective.\n\n...and the DOK.archive Award goes to OUR SISTER ANGELA – BLACK POWER IN THE GDR by Katharina Warda and Jascha Hannover, produced by Florianfilm GmbH. The award honours a documentary film project in development that uses archive material. Endowed with € 15,000 provision (or alternatively € 2,500.-). British Pathé is prize sponsor. The DOK.archive Award is a promotional award for compilation films in development. High-quality archive footage is often almost invaluable for documentary films – and expensive. With the award, British Pathé and DOK.forum want to promote projects that work with licensed material.\n\nThis year the award goes to OUR SISTER ANGELA – BLACK POWER IN THE GDR by Katharina Warda and Jascha Hannover: In the 1970s, an enthusiastic solidarity movement supporting the Black US civil rights activist Angela Davis emerges in East Germany. Angela attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators during her visits to the country. But all this enthusiasm is deceptive... Co-director Katharina Warda tells this story from a personal perspective. From the jury's statement: \"The use of archive material is of crucial importance for this project. ... The filmmakers provide an intelligent analysis of a historical event: One could dismiss Angela Davis' visit to the GDR as pure propaganda, but from today's perspective it is clearly more than that. ... The filmmakers reclaim the narrative of the material, and reinterprete and use it from the perspective of coming to terms with the history of people of colour in the former GDR...\"\n\nDOK.talent Award, a unique pitch format for students. Sponsored by ndF Entertainment GmbH @ndf_film\n\n...and the DOK.talent Award goes to POLITIK IST PERSÖNLICH (WT: BUILD A PARTY) by Indira Geisel\n\nThe pitch competition DOK.talent Award offers students from the partner universities of DOK.fest München the opportunity to present their current projects to industry experts and receive valuable feedback. The most convincing project receives the award, which is donated by ndF Entertainment GmbH and endowed with € 2,500 in research funding. This year, the twelve-member jury honoured to the project POLITIK IST PERSÖNLICH by Indira Geisel (HFF München). From the jury's statement:\" ... In a very close decision, the jury decided for a project in which the filmmaker portrays three generations of her own family – in which, as she says, 'campaigning is a family affair'. Let it be known: POLITIK IST PERSÖNLICH, a film that engages with ambivalence, allows for critical distance and, on a personal level, seeks its own fresh perspective, is the well deserved winner. We congratulate Indira Geisel and her team on winning the DOK.talent Award 2024.\"\n\nDOK.composition Award The best musical concept for a documentary film will be endowed with €2,500 sponsored by Sonoton Music.

Dreh's Um initiator Duc Ngo Ngoc: \"On the one hand, it's about making films and, on the other, about empowering yourself with your own perspective, taking the camera into your own hands and figuratively turning it on yourself – away from the white, often stereotypical view of our community\".\n\nThe AG DOK Speed Dating enables exchange of experience and active networking within the specialist audience of social work stakeholders and funding institutions.

The films at the festival reflected these in a constructive way. We were able to show the Munich audience the works of many filmmakers who reflect the political situation in Europe and the world with an individual, reflective view. And we were able to facilitate encounters with directors who provide insights that are otherwise inaccessible to us. For example, with the director of HOLLYWOODGATE, Ibrahim Nash'at, who was able to accompany the Taliban when they took over a US base in Afghanistan. To be able to present such filmmakers and their stories in Munich: That is the essence of DOK.fest München. We are delighted that our audience is loyal to the festival and look forward with great anticipation to our anniversary edition next year.\n\nas single page:\n\n• 39 DOK.fest Munich 2024 •\n\n• 38 DOK.fest Munich 2023 •\n\n• 37 DOK.fest Munich 2022 •\n\n• 36 DOK.fest Munich 2021 •\n\n• 35 DOK.fest Munich 2020 •\n\n• 34 DOK.fest Munich 2019 •\n\n• 33 DOK.fest Munich 2018 •\n\n31 Sheffield DocFest will open on June 12 with the world premiere of Kevin Macdonald’s KLITSCHKO: MORE THAN A FIGHT. Annabel Grundy, Sheffield DocFest Managing Director, says: “Kevin Macdonald joined us in Sheffield in 2023 as Mentor for our Filmmaker Challenge, inspiring participants to take a creative and compassionate approach to their works. With KLITSCHKO: MORE THAN A FIGHT we see his commitment to artistry and authenticity in equal measure; we’re honoured to welcome him back to present this incredible portrait of hope, charisma and determination to make a difference.”\n\nKLITSCHKO: MORE THAN A FIGHT offers audiences unprecedented access to former heavyweight boxing world champion Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir, who together dominated the sport for more than a decade. Now the longest serving Mayor of Kyiv, this feature-length documentary charts Vitali’s journey from the ring to political office, leading the defence of the capital when it was attacked by Russian forces in February 2022 to the present day.\n\nWhile Wladimir uses his celebrity status and popularity to help raise funds and military support for the defence of Ukraine, the heart of the story is the remarkable transformation of Vitali from sporting hero to political figurehead. From the face of the opposition in the 2014 Maidan Revolution to the mayor running on an anti-corruption card, Vitali tests his leadership capabilities as he’s put in charge of the safety of millions of Kyiv citizens, with the eyes of the world watching.\n\nKFF INDUSTRY: V4 Co-Pro Meetings During 64.

Its idea is to initiate contacts between film producers and filmmakers from the region in order to establish cooperation in a field of film production. Participants of the V4 Co-Pro Meeting will also meet with Ukrainian producers to discuss co-production opportunities.\n\nAn important highlight of this year’s event will be a discussion on the possibility of launching a ‘V4 Film Fund’, a Visegrad co-production fund, which was a demand of the 2023 Visegrad producers’ meetings. The discussion will be attended by representatives of producer organisations and film institutions from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The meetings in a round-table formula will be accompanied with the individual consultations with invited experts from Tv stations, VOD platforms, production companies or sales agencies.\n\n... and the OSCAR® goes to 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL | 20 TAGE IN MARIUPOL by Mstyslaw Tschernow, co-financed by SWR/ARD German Public Broadcasting Network, responsible SWReditors: Eric Friedler and Thore Vollert. World Sales by DOGWOOF.\n\n20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL by Mstyslaw Tschernow\n\nFoto © 2022 SWR/\n\nCONGRATULATION to Mstyslaw Tschernow, who sadly says in his acceptance speech among others: \"This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history. And I’m honored, but probably I'll be the first director on this stage who says I wish I had never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this for Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities...Russians are killing tens of thousands of my fellow Ukrainians. I wish for them to release all the hostages, all the soldiers who are protecting their lands, all the civilians who are now in their jails. But I cannot change the history. I cannot change the past … We can make sure history record is set straight and that the truth will prevail. … Cinema forms memories, and memories form history …\n\nThe other nominees for the documentary feature category of the 96 Academy Award® are:\n\n• BOB WINE: THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT by Moses Bwayo, Christopher Sharp, John Battsek\n\n• THE ETERNAL MEMORY by Maite Alberdi\n\n• OLFAS TÖCHTER | LES FILLES D'OLFA | FOUR DAUGHTERS by Kaouther Ben Hania and Nadim Cheikhrouha\n\n• TO KILL A TIGER by Nisha Pahuja, Cornelia Principe, David Oppenheim\n\n36 IDFA November 8–19, 2023, Pressconference with Orwa Nyrabia\n\nIDFA 2023 opens with the world premiere of A PICTURE TO REMEMBER by Olga Chernykh. The film presents a deeply personal and essay-style account of the ongoing war in Ukraine and its violent history, seen through the prism of three generations of women: Chernykh herself, her mother, and her grandmother. In a bid for connection and intimacy, the filmmaker uses old family films, recordings of conversations, and news reports to bridge the distance between her and her grandmother. The result is a kaleidoscopic and personal film that travels through time fluidly. A PICTURE TO REMEMBER has been selected for the Envision Competition and received IDFA Bertha Fund support in 2023.\n\n\"This is a film by an independent filmmaker that is both personal and political. By building her film around three generations of women in her family, Chernykh carriers us to the daily experience of Ukrainians today. The director does not shy away from trying to build a cinematic world with fragile elements. The courage and originality of the film's approach opens up to a much larger world view. That's what place films like A Picture to Remember at the heart of IDFA,\" said IDFA's Artistic Director, Orwa Nyrabia.\n\nDOK Industry Talk at 66 DOK Leipzig presents ARTE initiative\n\nGENERATION UKRAINE\n\nIn this year's edition, DOK Leipzig is presenting a DOK Industry Talk on Generation Ukraine, a new initiative by the ARTE Group aimed at supporting the Ukrainian filmmaking industry by co-producing 12 documentaries that explore Ukrainian reality in the throes of the ongoing war.\n\nThe Talk, held on 10 October at 16:30 – 18:00 CEST, will present the ARTE initiative and showcase six of the projects with the participation of the film teams. The Talk will be moderated by documentary film producer and consultant Heidi Fleisher.\n\nThe ARTE Group and its European partners launched the project Generation Ukraine in a concerted effort to bolster the realisation and distribution of the Ukrainian film projects that have been conceived since the beginning of the Russian invasion and are in dire straits documenting the lasting impacts of the war on their country, its collective memory, land, and its people. The kick-off workshop of the Generation Ukraine project took place in Strasbourg in January 2023. From Wednesday, October 11th, a three-day workshop on \"Generation Ukraine\" will commence at the MDR headquarters in Leipzig.\n\nFollowing the example of Generation Africa, which gave a platform for young African filmmakers across the continent to tell their stories and reach diverse audiences, ARTE is supporting 12 Ukrainian documentary projects in various stages of development, selected from some 30 high-quality submissions. The selected Ukrainian film projects are financed by the ARTE group (ARTE France, ARTE GEIE and ARTE Germany), through co-productions or pre-sales, and in collaboration with the broadcaster's European partners.

Among the films premiering this year at the festival there is one in particular that witnesses the shock we all felt. More than a documentary, SUPERPOWER is the chronicle of a film project that reality forced to change in to something less controllable but more meaningful. In a festival that will take place one year after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, it is important to show the film that Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman made under such difficult conditions. Like their colleagues who risked their lives in order to testify the cruelty of the war, they prove once more that art can inspire action worldwide.\n\nEASTERN FRONT | SHIDNIY FRONT by Vitaly Mansky & Yevhen Titarenko, Latvia / Czech Republic / Ukraine / USA [Encounter]\n\nIT'S A DATE by Nadia Parfan, Ukraine [Short]\n\nIRON BUTTERFLIES by Roman Liubyi, Ukraine / Germany [Panorama]\n\nDO YOU LOVE ME? | TY MENE LUBYSH? by Tonia Noyabrova, Ukraine / Sweden [Panorama]\n\nIN UKRAINE | W UKRAINIE by by Piotr Pawlus, Tomasz Wolski, Poland, Germany [Forum]\n\nWE WILL NOT FADE AWAY | MY NE ZGASNEMO by Alisa Kovalenko, Ukraine / France / Poland [Generation]\n\nWAKING UP IN SILENCE | IM STILLEN ERWACHEN by Mila Zhluktenko, Germany / Ukraine, [Generation]\n\nand\n\nTHE BLINDSIGHT by Ruslan Batytskyi, [Berlinale Co-Production Market]\n\nThe EFM is supporting the industry with a package of special measures.\n\nfind out more in the press release 73 BERLINAE of January 20, 2023.\n\nIRON BUTTERLIES by Roman Liubyi\n\nis premiering Januar 23 2023 at the Sundance Film Festival\n\nand 73 BERLINALE Panorama Dokumente 2023\n\nIn summer 2014, sunflower fields and coal mines in eastern Ukraine turned into a 12 square kilometer crime scene.

Her life is pretty normal until the day that President Viktor Yanukovych refuses to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. Suddenly, everything changes: protests erupt in the capital, with the inhabitants demanding the president’s resignation. Alisa witnesses the demonstrations and embarks on a trip through Ukraine in an attempt to understand the war. Her journey takes her to the east of the country, where she comes across demonstrations again, this time of a pro-Russian character. Along the way, she faces shootings, explosions and the searing consequences of the war for the people of her country. Very much against her will, Alisa is then personally caught up in the war when she is arrested by separatists for spying. The risks she is taking also jeopardize her romantic relationship with a French journalist. This candid self-portrait shows us a sensitive, concerned woman in search of answers. The direct, often handheld camerawork gives us an impression of Ukraine in the wake of the protests and of the tensions that arose among the various population groups.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE IN UKRAINE a Filmmaker's Conversation\n\n—Industry Insights—\n\nThe EFM Podcast published\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nThis podcast episode is a special edition dedicated to the current invasion of Ukraine. Tamara Tatishvili (Head of Training - MEDICI the Film Funding Journey) is moderating this episode and speaks with Julia Sinkevych (Producer, Ukraine), Tanja Georgieva-Waldhauer (Producer, Germany), and Keti Machavariani (Producer/ Director, Georgia). They talk about the fact that the war in Ukraine did not start on 24 February, but eight years ago with the annexation of Crimea. We hear four women and their fear on the one hand and their will to stand up for peace on the other. Film and cinema have enormous power; those have to be used and supported in the right way. Because the misuse for propaganda purposes is a real a danger. In this time more than ever the film industry needs to stand together. Filmmakers have the tools to reach a big audience. The industry should endorse Ukrainian film projects from the past to achieve awareness and gather financial resources to support the fight for freedom in Ukraine.\n\nIndustry Insights – The EFM Podcast is presented by the European Film Market of the Berlinale.\n\nThe podcast is available on all major podcast platforms, e.g. Spotify or Apple Podcasts\n\nUKRAINE FOCUS @ Sheffield DocFest, June 23—28 June, 2022\n\nSheffield DocFest in solidarity with Ukraine Password: Palianytsia launch a collaborative documentary programme with Docudays UA, which will launch the British Council and Ukrainian Institute's 'UK/Ukraine Season of Culture'.

His fiancée, Hanna Bilobrova, who was with him at the time, was able to bring back the footage filmed there and edited it with Mantas' editor Dounia Sichov. The film is entitled MARIUPOLIS 2 and premiered May 19 at 75 FESTIVAL DE CANNES 2022\n\n.\n\nMariupolis 2: footage saved from the ravages of the war in Ukraine written by Tarik Khaldi\n\nVIKTOR DOK.international, the main award of 37 DOK.fest Munich goes to the French production TRENCHES by Loup Bureau, who accompanied Ukrainian soldiers fighting Russia-backed separatists in the Donbass. He shows how the soldiers try to lead a reasonably normal everyday life between explosions and enemy attacks. The Berlin based company FILMS BOUTIQUE is in charge of World Sales of the awarded documentary.\n\nTRENCHES by French director Loup Bureau\n\nPhoto © 2021 FILMS BOUTIQUE World Sales\n\nVIKTOR DOK.international jury:\n\n\"For weeks, months, years they have been living in their trenches. Loup Bureau accompanied them there. This commitment alone is prize worthy. But TRENCHES is also a beautiful film: without any grandstanding, with a lot of respect for its protagonists and in a black and white that emphasizes the timelessness of war, Bureau documents life in the trenches, the daily shoveling and fastening, but also cooking, cutting hair, talking. The calmness that Bureau's pictures radiate is, of course, a deceptive one, which we – even as viewers – cannot forget for a second. At any time another attack can occur. And it takes place. The urgency of the film has increased immeasurably since its completion in 2021.\"\n\nPUSHING BOUNDARIES by Lesia Kordonets, 102min\n\nFoto: 2021 DSCHOINT VENTSCHR FILMPRODUKTION AG\n\nThe Ukrainian director Lesia Kordonets receives the megaherz Student Award for PUSHING BOUNDARIES at the 37 DOK.fest Munich. The documentary follows five Ukrainian athletes preparing for the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro when suddenly Putin's Russia annexes the Crimea, where the Ukrainian team's new training center is located. But the athletes don't want to give up their dream, continue their work out in other places under the most adverse conditions and, despite everything, try to qualify for the next Paralympic Games.\n\nJury: \"Lesia's athletes are everyday heroes who suddenly come up against sporting, political and existential limits and yet tirelessly give everything to achieve their goals. In the film, every story is told unobtrusively and at eye level. PUSHING BOUNDARIES, that means pushing boundaries, expanding boundaries. The sensitive editing pushes boundaries as well and shows us that there are no disabled people – only people whith handicap. We learn what it means when we play down wars as 'conflicts'. The documentary is also about addressing uncomfortable truths, which was important to us in our decision, but PUSHING BOUNDARIES is not only an important film in this respect.\"\n\nThe film was also awarded with Prix Zonta 2021 at Nyon, Visions du Réel, Nyon, Best Directing Documentary –Zürcher Filmpreis 2021, as well as Brave Rebels Award 2022 at Budapest International Documentary Film Festival.\n\nThe Roman Brodmann Prize was awarded for the first time April 28, at the Roman Brodmann Colloquium in Berlin, honoring an outstanding political-investigative documentary film, is endowed with €10,000, and goes to the Polish/German co–production The Hamlet Syndrome depicting the young Ukrainian generation scarred by war and political breakthroughs.\n\nTHE HAMLET SYNDROME | DAS HAMLET-SYNDROM by Elwira Niewiera, Piotr Rosolowski, 85min P: BALAPOLIS sp.zo.o., Kundschafter Filmprod, Neue Celluloid Fabrik\n\nIn view of Russia’s brutal war of aggression on Ukraine, the 37th DOK.fest München is showing five films that deal with its background: four current films from Ukraine as well as the opening film NAWALNY about Russia’s most important opposition figure Alexei Nawalny, which is running in the international competition.\n\nFestival directors Daniel Sponsel and Adele Kohout: “The opening film comprehensively outlines that our expectation that stable democratic structures would be established in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet system did not come true. The idea of partnership oriented towards the economy and the market is also proving to be obsolete. The flourishing landscapes in the East are more or less reserved for the oligarchs, and the country under Putin remains trapped in the Soviet Union’s claims to world power. The brutal present follows its long shadow of the past, which we did not want to see for so long. The first casualties of any war are truth and humanity. The films from and about Ukraine in our programme impressively testify to how the weakest members of a society are affected.”\n\nOnline Talk : Ukraine : Filming in resistance.\n\nTHU 14.04 | 16:00-17:30pm | Online only visionsdureel.ch\n\nSince 24 February, the war in Ukraine has also been conducted through the images that report on it or distort its reality. Visions du Réel wishes to offer a platform to young Ukrainian filmmakers and producers who are currently standing alongside their compatriots under the Russian bombs, to reflect and debate with them on the possibility of resisting the ongoing onslaught with images that document it.\n\nICFR launches \"Emergency Fund for Filmmakers\" in Wake of Ukraine War.\n\nThe International Coalition for Filmmakers at Risk has set up a special \"Emergency Fund for Filmmakers\" for film practitioners directly in danger due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Coalition and the Fund have been canvassing for funding and donations as soon as war broke out. In the past days, significant financial contributions have been pledged by Germany's key national and regional film funding bodies (100K EUR), by La Scam*, the Netherlands Film Fund, and by many individual donors.\n\nThe German funds include Filmförderungsanstalt FFA, FilmFernsehFonds Bayern, Film- und Medienstiftung NRW, HessenFilm und Medien, Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, MFG - Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg, Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung, MOIN Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein, MV Filmförderung, nordmedia - Film- und Mediengesellschaft Niedersachsen/Bremen.\n\nsee also PR by IDFA .\n\nThe NGO Docudays and Docudays UA festival team has initiated a fund to support Ukrainian filmmakers who are bravely and daringly documenting the events of the war in Ukraine right now: recording war crimes, filming footage for the international media and for their future films which will later give the world a more in-depth perspective on the situation in our country.

It has become quiet on the streets of Minsk, where just a few months ago thousands of demonstrators were protesting against the outcome of the presidential elections. Lukashenko used all the force he could muster against the demonstrators, and many of the participants are now in prison.

Or to the time when people searched for a new idea for their country? Or is it rather the long echo of Soviet mentality that led to this bloody conflict? The film portrays the town Dobropolye, in Eastern Ukraine – 70 km from the border with the breakaway republics – and some of its people against the backdrop of the war.\n\nKHAN'S FLESH by Georg Kussmann, Krystsina Savutsina ©2021\n\n...Like a Dziga Vertov on Lexomil, Krystsina Savutsina’s camera captures a series of gestures, micro non-events and simultaneous rituals, like so many daily choreographies to which the inhabitants of this Belarusian village, from every generation, devote or submit themselves...
