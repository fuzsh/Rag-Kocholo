        "text": "Professor Charu Monga is ensuring that children in remote areas have the tools to develop their problem-solving skills thanks to her educational backpack. In addition, a solar lamp is incorporated into the design to help students travel safely from school in areas where power outages are frequent.\n\nTackling air pollution, 24-year-old self-taught engineer Emmanuel built the Imagination Car, Sierra Leone's first locally made solar car, entirely from waste. Driven to address other issues in his country, he also built eight legs for amputees, and a solar-powered lamp. He is currently raising money to expand his project.\n\nA writer and disability rights activist, Jamila advises the city of Baku to create a more inclusive subway system. Sharing her personal struggles, she is collaborating with local authorities and engineers to design an app for people with disabilities to get assistance on the metro.\n\nNoticing the pile of garbage and the stench of the streets, Hong found a way to turn food waste into cleaning products. Her business transforms 109 tons of waste into 51,000 liters of product per month. It has created employment opportunities for more than 400 women, giving them financial independence and new skills.\n\nThis agricultural association is making the village of Ancocala agriculturally self-sufficient by structuring terraces based on traditional Inca knowledge. Located in the Andes, a region affected by climate change and water scarcity, the terraces help recycle irrigation water and protect crop fields from extreme weather conditions."
