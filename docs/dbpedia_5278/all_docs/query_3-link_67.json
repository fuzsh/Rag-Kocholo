        "text": "This year, DOK Leipzig will celebrate its 67th edition. We look forward to welcoming you to Leipzig from 28 October to 3 November.\n\nWith contemporary international films, unique curated programmes and a rich programme for children and adults, we invite our audience to discover the range of contemporary documentary and animated film. Our competition categories give exciting artistic works a place to celebrate their premieres.\n\nWith DOK Neuland, we present the public with a curated exhibition of Extended Reality works. Each year this creates a world where visitors can experience profound stories in unexpected virtual spaces.\n\nFirst programme details will be announced in September. Read more about DOK Leipzig and our values and goals in the festival profile.\n\nWe present four competitions and two sections out of competition at DOK Leipzig. The main festival prizes – the Golden and Silver Doves – will be awarded in the competitions. The winners are selected by independent juries. Additionally, further prizes are presented by our partners within the festival.\n\nIn addition to the competition categories, we also present several curated series within our programme. With these formats we focus on film historic topics or honour the work of outstanding film artists. These include a retrospective, homages, matinees and programmes for children and young people (Kids DOK).\n\nWe also organize film screenings for our audience in Leipzig and in the region during the year and show festival hits from recent years at our monthly DOK Days. With our DOK Leipzig Summer Cinema, we are presenting film highlights in beautiful open-air cinemas across the city in July and August.\n\nWe love to follow the journey of our festival films! In our DOK 365 section you can find updates on their theatrical releases in Germany and see which DOK Leipzig films you can currently watch from the comfort of your home."
