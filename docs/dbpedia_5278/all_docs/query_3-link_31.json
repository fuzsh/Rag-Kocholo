        "text": "The best thing to do is to send an inquiry to the Arolsen Archives. Because even if your search does not produce any results, documents on the subject may still exist, as only some parts of the collection are available in the online archive. Another reason for the lack of search results could be that some documents are only available in scanned form. If this is the case, the contents of the file concerned are not searched. This applies to lists from concentration camps, for example. The process of indexing the documents to improve usability is already underway, but this is an enormous task that will take many years to complete. However, it was important to us to make documents on the following subjects publicly available as quickly as possible: Nazi persecution, Holocaust survivors, victims of political persecution, members of the resistance, long-forgotten victim groups such as Sinti and Roma and the forced laborers of the “Third Reich”.\n\nAlmost all documents related to concentration camps are perpetrator documents. This means that they were created by and used by National Socialists in concentration camp administrations. Most notably, the information given on the physical characteristics of the inmates or on the reasons for their imprisonment is racist and degrading. So the information in the documents must be viewed extremely critically. You must be aware of this when you work with them. The e-Guide can help you to understand the documents in their context. It contains simple and interactive explanatory information on all the common types of document: who created the documents and why, what information do the documents contain and what is important to consider when dealing with the documents. You can find the e-Guide here.\n\nThe same terms of use apply to the use of the online archive as for visiting the Arolsen Archives. The International Committee, as the highest governing body, has defined these terms of use. They do not comply with German or other national archive law.\n\nPlease note that the online archive contains sensitive data on the victims of National Socialist persecution. This data may include information about religious affiliation, family background, health, sexual orientation and world view, membership of trade unions or political parties and also criminal records.\n\nAll users of the online archive are personally responsible for complying with data protection rights and other laws. This includes the interests of other people who are affected as well as generally accepted practices relating to personal data. The Arolsen Archives cannot be held responsible for publications which result from the use of the collections.\n\nPlease contact us if you, as a relative of a victim of persecution, for example, do not consent to the publication of certain personal data."
