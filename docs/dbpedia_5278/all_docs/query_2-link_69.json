        "text": "After making the festival rounds and receiving widespread critical acclaim, the documentary imperfect is now available to stream on various platforms. Co-directed by longtime New Mobility columnist Regan Linton, imperfect follows professional actors with disabilities at Phamaly, a disability-affirmative theater company in Denver, through a full production of the musical Chicago. The film explores themes of resilience and creativity.\n\nA talented actor herself, Linton served as the artistic director for Phamaly for five years and is featured prominently in the film. “I feel like every cell in my body was involved with this film from start to finish, at all levels! It was a labor of love of the best kind,” she says.\n\nimperfect premiered at the Denver Film Festival in October 2021 and went on to screen at 25 film festivals in 2022 and 2023. It has now made its way to streaming platforms, including Tubi, Google Play and YouTube.\n\nLinton is excited to expand the canon of films authentically chronicling the disability experience. “When I was paralyzed in 2002, I turned to movies to find some kind of indication of what possibilities might exist for me in the future. What I found wasn’t very uplifting … so I never thought working in the arts would be a possibility for me again,” says Linton.\n\nOver the years, films like Murderball came out to change her perspective. And she hopes to do the same for others through her film. “I hope imperfect shows people — with and without disabilities — the reality of what does exist out there for humans of all kinds, regardless of your circumstance,” she says. “We need to keep forging paths and sharing those stories so that others know it’s possible.”"
