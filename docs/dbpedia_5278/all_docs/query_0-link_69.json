        "text": "Undergraduate Degree Requirements\n\nDegrees Offered\n\nFlorida State University confers at the bachelor's level the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Music Education, Bachelor of Social Work, and the Bachelor of Science degrees, the requirements for which are described in detail below. Students may find requirements for all graduate degrees (master's, specialist, professional, and doctoral) in the Graduate Bulletin.\n\nStudents pursuing a baccalaureate degree at Florida State University must meet numerous state- and University-wide degree requirements as they progress through their course of studies. In general, freshman and sophomore students in most majors emphasize work in a broad-based liberal arts curriculum, CoreFSU, and in consultation with their advisors select a major concentration. By the end of the sophomore year, all students should have completed at least half of the General Education portion of the CoreFSU curriculum, including the English Composition and Quantitative and Logical Thinking requirements.\n\nAround the end of the sophomore year (fifty-two degree-hours), students formally select a major and request acceptance by the college in which the major is taught. Students transferring into the University with an Associate of Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public community college or university, or transferring fifty-two or more semester hours of credit, are eligible to be admitted directly into the college of their choice provided they meet minimum requirements for the major selected.\n\nStudents at the junior and senior level complete the requirements of their chosen major and often of a minor field. They may also have to fulfill additional requirements specific to their college and/or certification requirements to engage in a particular profession for which their undergraduate major is preparatory.\n\nUnderstanding these degree requirements is crucial to smooth progression to graduation. Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisors regularly throughout their undergraduate years to ensure that they are making appropriate progress toward their degree and to consult their academic deans' offices, Advising First, and the Office of the University Registrar for assistance and clarification of degree requirements.\n\nBaccalaureate Degree Requirements\n\nFlorida State University will confer the bachelor's degree when the following conditions have been met. Restrictions may be found under ‘Transfer Credit' in the “Academic Regulations and Procedures” chapter of this General Bulletin.\n\nSatisfactory completion of Florida State University's CoreFSU requirements with a minimum overall adjusted grade point average of 2.0. The CoreFSU curriculum requirements are divided into two curriculum segments: General Education and University-Wide Graduation Requirements, which encompass all state requirements. A full discussion of these requirements can be found in this chapter below, under the “CoreFSU Curriculum.”\n\nSatisfactory completion of major requirements in a chosen degree program, including additional requirements set by the college offering the degree. The student's degree program will appear on the baccalaureate diploma. A list of degree programs is available in the “Academic Degree and Certificate Programs” chapter of this General Bulletin. Major names are not printed on university diplomas.\n\nA minimum adjusted grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 on all coursework taken at Florida State University is required for a degree. In addition, the overall GPA on all college-level work attempted (high school dual enrollment, transfer and FSU coursework) is used as part of the determination of degrees of distinction. See the “Degrees of Distinction” section of this chapter for more information.\n\nSuccessful completion of a minimum of one hundred twenty unduplicated semester hours. Physical education activity courses may count as elective credit except in cases where an individual degree program places a specific limit.\n\nCompletion of at least forty-five semester hours in courses numbered 3000 and above, thirty of which need to be taken at Florida State University.\n\nCompletion of the last thirty semester hours and half of the major course semester hours, in residence at this University. In cases of emergency, a maximum of six hours of the final thirty semester hours may be completed by correspondence or residence at another accredited institution with the approval of the academic dean. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) credit earned may be applied to the final thirty-hour requirement provided that the student has earned at least thirty semester hours credit at Florida State University.\n\nStudents who have entered a university in the State of Florida, Division of Colleges and Universities, with fewer than sixty hours of credit in the fall of 1976 or any time thereafter are required to earn at least nine hours prior to graduation by attendance in one or more Summer terms at one of the State University System institutions. The University President may waive the application of this rule in cases of unusual hardship to the individual. Students may request waivers of this requirement by giving the details of their hardships through their academic deans to the Vice President for Faculty Development and Advancement. Prior to 2011, students who had earned nine semester hours of credit through approved acceleration methods (AP, IB, CLEP, and approved dual enrollment courses) were exempt from the summer residency requirement. Effective 2011, this exemption is no longer available.\n\nSatisfaction of the foreign-language admissions requirement by having two sequential units of the same foreign language in high school, or eight semester hours of the same foreign language in college, or documented equivalent proficiency.\n\nSuccessful completion of the Civic Literacy requirement.\n\nSuccessful completion of coursework constituting the student's program of studies, minor, Honors in the Major Research, or certification examination does not guarantee the awarding of the baccalaureate degree. Faculty judgment of the academic performance of the student is inherent in the educational process in determining whether the awarding of the baccalaureate degree or admission into a higher level degree program is warranted.\n\nNote: For the purpose of establishing residency, the various Summer sessions are considered one semester.\n\nFollowing is a full discussion of state- and University-wide degree requirements at the undergraduate level. Requirements specific to a particular college may be found in the section of this General Bulletin describing that college. Major and minor requirements may be found under the appropriate department in the departmental listings.\n\nState Mandated Academic Learning Compacts (SMALCs)\n\nThe State Board of Governors has directed each university to develop Academic Learning Compacts for every baccalaureate degree program. A State University System Academic Learning Compact (SMALC) identifies for each academic bachelor's program what students will learn by the end of a program and how knowledge is measured above and beyond course grades.\n\nA SMALC must pinpoint the core learning expectations in the areas of communication, critical thinking skills, and content/discipline knowledge and skills. Additionally, it must identify the corresponding assessments used to determine how well the student has assimilated the articulated expectations.\n\nSuccessful performance related to the State Mandated Academic Learning Compacts specific to your degree is a requirement for graduation.\n\nVisit https://provost.fsu.edu/outcomes/smalcs-report/ to view the current version of the SMALCs for your degree. Simply select your major and detailed information is provided. You may also obtain information pertaining to SMALCs by contacting the academic departments.\n\nDivision of Undergraduate Studies\n\nDean: Joseph O'Shea\n\nAssociate Deans: Craig Filar, Lynn Hogan, Nikki Raimondi; Assistant Deans: Courtney Barry, Heather Bishop, DeOnte Brown, Miguel Negron, Allison Peters, LaShae Roberts\n\nThe Division of Undergraduate Studies is responsible for the supervision and monitoring of state- and University-wide degree requirements as well as University-wide academic support offices. Overseen by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, the division includes the Office of Undergraduate Studies (the academic home of most freshmen and sophomores), Advising First, the Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement (CARE), the University Honors Program, Transfer and Information Services, the Academic Center for Excellence (ACE), the Office of National Fellowships, and the Center for Undergraduate Research and Academic Engagement. For further information on these academic support offices see ‘Honors Program' in the “University Honors Program and Honor Societies” chapter and ‘Advising First', the ‘Center for Academic Retention and Enhancement', ‘Center for Undergraduate Research and Academic Engagement', and ‘Transfer and Information Services' in the “Academic Advising and Support Services” chapter of this General Bulletin.\n\nFreshmen and sophomores have their programs and coursework supervised by the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Exceptions to this placement are students accepted into the College of Music, College of Motion Picture Arts, or into the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) program in theatre or dance. Students in these majors are advised and supervised directly within their own schools or departments. The Office of Undergraduate Studies is the dean's office that administers the academic and advisement program, regardless of intended major, for all other freshman and sophomore students.\n\nCoreFSU Curriculum\n\nThe CoreFSU curriculum provides an educational foundation that enables FSU students to thrive in and beyond the classroom. Across the curriculum, students build the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in the major and life after college.\n\nStatewide Requirements\n\nCollege-Level Communication and Computation Requirement\n\nThe State of Florida mandates minimum communication and computation skills for all students in Florida public institutions of higher education. The Statewide General Education Core and the University-wide requirements are designed to meet these requirements. The statewide graduation requirements of these rules follow.\n\nStudents will satisfy the requirements of this rule by completing, with a grade of “C–” or higher in each course, the General Education requirements in Quantitative and Logical Thinking, English Composition, and two other approved courses that require college-level writing for a total of six additional writing credits. The six additional writing credits may be fulfilled through successful completion of approved “W” (State-Mandated Writing) or E-Series courses. These requirements must be completed prior to receipt of an Associate of Arts degree from Florida State University.\n\nCredit by Examination. A student shall be allowed to partially satisfy the State mandates for communication and computation by earning academic credit for approved Quantitative and Logical Thinking, English Composition, or “W” (State-Mandated Writing) coursework with a passing score on an appropriate AP, IB, AICE or CLEP examination. Refer to the AP, IB, AICE, and CLEP Tables in the “Academic Regulations and Procedures” chapter of this General Bulletin for college course equivalents and credits earned. Students will still be required to take ENC 2135 (or an approved 2000-level ENC composition course) to meet FSU requirements for English Composition and General Education.\n\nTransfer Credits or Correspondence Credits. Students transferring to Florida State University who have been certified by Florida State University as having completed the AA degree from a Florida public university, state college, community college, or other college with which Florida State University maintains an official articulation agreement are deemed to have satisfied the State mandates for communication and computation and Florida State University's General Education requirements.\n\nStudents transferring from other institutions that come under the provision of these State mandates, but who have not received the AA degree will be deemed to have satisfied the State mandates for General Education if the previous institution indicates, by notation on the transcript or by some other form of written certification, that the student has satisfied these State mandates before leaving that institution.\n\nTransferring students who do not fall into either of the above categories will be required to satisfy Florida State University's plan for State mandates.\n\nStatewide General Education Core\n\nThe State of Florida Statute 1007.25 regarding General Education outlines the statewide general education core for students entering the State University System (SUS) and Florida College System (FCS). Information on the statute, the implementation process, and the decisions made is posted on the official Website at http://www.fldoe.org/policy/articulation/general-edu-core-course-options.stml.\n\nThe Statewide General Education Core requirements apply to students initially entering the SUS or FCS in the 2015-2016 academic year and thereafter. Fifteen (three credit hours from each category) of the thirty-six General Education credits must be earned from the five Statewide General Education Core requirement categories (at FSU, these are: English Composition, Quantitative and Logical Thinking, Social Sciences/History, Humanities and Cultural Practice/Ethics, and Natural Sciences). All SUS and FCS institutions must accept these courses for transfer credit, but no institution must offer all courses.\n\nGeneral Education Digital Badge Series: Section 1007.25, Florida Statutes, was revised in 2021 to create the General Education Digital Badge Series. Career readiness competencies are evaluated for alignment with general education student learning outcomes. At the time of publication, staff from the Division of Florida College and Office of the Board of Governors identified the first digital badge with the anticipation of creating four additional badges for a total of five badges, mirroring the five General Education Core areas.\n\nFundamentals of Written Communication: Beginning in Fall 2022, Florida public postsecondary institutions will offer students a “Fundamentals of Written Communication” digital badge upon successful completion with a grade of “C” or better of ENC 1101 or a course with an “ENC” prefix for which ENC 1101 is an immediate prerequisite. By earning this badge, students document their personal communication skills including effective reading, writing, speaking, listening, and nonverbal communication skills. This badge will convey to future employers that students have acquired vital skills needed for professional success.\n\nCivic Literacy\n\nStudents first entering any Florida College System institution or State University System institution as degree-seeking undergraduates in the 2018-2019 school year and thereafter must demonstrate competency in civic literacy prior to receipt of the baccalaureate degree. This includes transfer students and students seeking a second bachelor's degree who began as degree-seeking undergraduates at any FCS or SUS institution in the 2018-2019 school year or thereafter.\n\nVisit https://core.fsu.edu, click on “For Advisors & Students” in the navigation menu, then click “Civic Literacy” for the most recent guidance on meeting the Civic Literacy requirement.\n\nCoreFSU General Education Requirements\n\nSatisfactory completion (a minimum adjusted grade point average of 2.0 on all courses used for General Education) of thirty-six semester hours of Florida State University's General Education courses within the CoreFSU curriculum as follows:\n\nQuantitative and Logical Thinking.

These two additional college-level writing courses may be fulfilled through successful completion of “W” (State-Mandated Writing) or E-Series courses. Transfer students who entered the University without having completed the General Education requirements elsewhere or who have not completed an articulated AA degree must complete two approved courses that meet the State-Mandated Writing requirement. To fulfill the college-level writing requirement, students must earn a grade of at least a “C–” in the course, and also earn at least a “C–” average on the required writing assignments. If a student does not earn a “C–” average or higher on the required writing assignments, the student will not earn an overall grade of “C–” or higher in the course, no matter how well the student performs in the remaining portion of the course. Students with an AA degree or General Education Statement from a Florida public university, state college, community college, or other colleges with which Florida State University maintains an official articulation agreement are exempt from the state mandates for college-level writing.\n\n“W” Courses\n\nAFA 2000w Introduction to the African-American Experience (3)\n\nAFA 3101dw Theories of African American Studies (3)\n\nAFA 3353dw Race, Class, and Gender Inequities in the United States (3)\n\nAMH 2010w The History of the United States to 1877 (3)\n\nAMH 2091dw The African-American Experience in the United States (3)\n\nAMH 2095dw American Indians in the United States (3)\n\nAMH 2096dw Black Women in America (3)\n\nAMH 2097dw Nationality, Race, and Ethnicity in the United States (3)\n\nAMH 3632w Environmental Policy: Twentieth Century and Beyond (3)\n\nAML 2010w American Authors to 1875 (3)\n\nAML 2600dw Introduction to African-American Literature (3)\n\nAML 3041w American Authors Since 1875 (3)\n\nAML 3311w Major Figures in American Literature (3)\n\nAML 3630w Latino/a Literature in English (3)\n\nAML 3682dw American Multi-Ethnic Literature (3)\n\nARH 2050w History and Criticism of Art I (3)\n\nARH 2051w History and Criticism of Art II (3)\n\nARH 2090sdw Great Discoveries in World Archaeology (3)\n\nARH 3130w Survey of Greek Art and Archaeology (3)\n\nARH 3150w Art and Archaeology of Ancient Italy (3)\n\nART 2003Csw Contemporary Art Scholarship and Practice (3)\n\nASH 1044dw Middle Eastern History and Civilization (3)\n\nASH 3100dw History of Asia (3)\n\nASH 3236dw History of Modern Turkey (3)\n\nASH 3402w China before 1898 (3)\n\nCLA 2010sdw Peoples of the Roman World (3)\n\nCLA 2110sw Debates about the Past: Greek Civilization, History, and Culture (3)\n\nCLA 2123sw Debates about the Past: Roman Civilization, History, and Culture (3)\n\nCLA 2810sdw Ancient Science for Non-Science Majors (3)\n\nCLA 3430w History of Ancient Greece (3)\n\nCLA 3440w History of Ancient Rome (3)\n\nCLA 3501dw Gender and Society in Ancient Greece (3)\n\nCLA 3502w Women, Children, and Slaves in Ancient Rome: The Roman Family (3)\n\nCLT 3370sw Classical Mythology (3)\n\nCLT 3378sdw Ancient Mythology, East and West (3)\n\nCLT 3510sdw The Ancient World in Film (3)\n\nDAN 2100sw Dance Appreciation (3)\n\nDAN 3144dw Cultural Perspectives on Dance (3)\n\nDAN 3145w Classical Perspectives on Dance (3)\n\nEGS 3045w Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Global Grand Challenges of Engineering (3)\n\nENL 2022w British Authors: Early Romantics to the Present (3)\n\nENL 3334w Introduction to Shakespeare (3)\n\nEUH 2000w Ancient and Medieval Civilizations (3)\n\nEUH 2314w Spain: Prehistory to the Present (3)\n\nEUH 3205dw 19th-Century Europe (3)\n\nEUH 3206dw 20th-Century Europe: A Survey (3)\n\nEUH 3530w England, the Empire and Commonwealth (3)\n\nFOW 2100w Literature and the World: An Invitation to Reading Across Modern Languages (3)\n\nFOW 3240dw Literature and Sexuality (3)\n\nFRT 3140dw Masterworks of French Literature in Translation;

All students are required to complete at least one Scholarship in Practice course and one approved Formative Experience, with the following exceptions: students who have completed an AA degree from an articulated institution (including those who have completed a high school AA degree from an articulated institution) and transfer students who enter the University with sixty or more credit hours are only required to complete either one Scholarship in Practice or one Formative Experience course.\n\nThe Scholarly and Formative Experiences requirement must be completed prior to the receipt of the baccalaureate degree.\n\nScholarship in Practice courses are classroom-based experiences that allow students to apply relevant areas of scholarship to an original project. A Scholarship in Practice course must be completed with a grade of “C–” or higher prior to the receipt of the baccalaureate degree. A Scholarship in Practice course at any level will count towards the graduation requirement.\n\nFormative Experiences are a type of hands-on, high impact practice through which students engage in independent, immersive learning settings outside the classroom that are relevant to their educational, professional, and life goals. Student participation in Formative Experiences must be evaluated by an instructor of record (faculty or qualified staff). Formative Experiences must be completed with a grade of “C–” or higher (or an “S” if taken on an S/U basis) in an approved course or through successful completion of the Experience Recognition Program through the FSU Career Center prior to the receipt of the baccalaureate degree. Students may satisfy the Formative Experience requirement by completing a second Scholarship in Practice course. For a Scholarship in Practice course to fulfill the Formative Experience requirement, the student must earn a “C–” or higher.\n\nScholarship in Practice Courses\n\nADV 3823rs Advertising Team II

Students will demonstrate the ability to apply scientific principles in designing and conducting experiments and interpret evidence. Laboratory courses are designated by the suffixes “L” or “C” appended to the course number. Students will typically take this course concurrently with the associated course (e.g., students will enroll in both BSC1005 and BSC 1005L). The Natural Sciences Laboratory requirement must be completed with a grade of “C–” or higher.\n\nUpper-Division Writing Requirement\n\nSkill in professional writing is critical to the long-term success of all FSU graduates. All students will be required to demonstrate competency in professional writing by completing one approved upper-division course that includes a substantial writing component. This coursework may be completed outside or within a student's major course of study or by Honors in the Major theses credit. The Upper-Division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of “C–” or higher.\n\nNote: Students must complete an Upper-Division Writing course in addition to the courses used to satisfy the State-Mandated Writing requirements.\n\nUpper-Division Writing Courses\n\nABT 3504d Trailblazing Arab Women (3)\n\nACG 4970r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nADV 3001 Advertising Strategy (3)\n\nADV 4300 Media Planning (3)\n\nAFA 4853 Research Methods and Scholarly Writing in Africana Studies (3)\n\nAML 4604d The African-American Literary Tradition (3)\n\nANT 4241d Anthropology of Religion (3)\n\nANT 4312 Contemporary Native American Cultures (3)\n\nANT 4914r Honors in the Major Research (1-3)\n\nARA 4970r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nARH 4800s Methods of Art History and Criticism (3)\n\nARH 4815r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nART 4801r BFA All-Media Critique (3)\n\nART 4851s BA: Exploring Opportunities in the Arts (3)\n\nART 4981r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nASH 3230s Middle East Research: An Interdisciplinary Seminar (3)\n\nASN 4463 Conceptualizations of the Imagination in East Asia (3)\n\nASN 4970r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nAST 3721Ls Astrophysics Laboratory (2)\n\nBCH 4053Ls General Biochemistry I Laboratory (3)\n\nBME 4801s Biomedical Engineering Design Process I (3)\n\nBME 4906r Honors URP in Biomedical Engineering (1-3)\n\nBSC 3402L Experimental Biology Laboratory (3)\n\nBSC 4970r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nCCJ 3024 The Criminal Justice System (3)\n\nCCJ 3032 Crime in Media (3)\n\nCCJ 3134 Portrayals of Policing in Cinema (3)\n\nCCJ 4909r Honors in Criminology (3)\n\nCEN 4020s Software Engineering I (3)\n\nCGN 4800s Senior Design I (3)\n\nCGN 4906r Honors in the Major Research in Civil and Environmental Engineering (1-6)\n\nCHI 4410 Advanced Chinese (3)\n\nCHI 4970r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nCHM 2211L Organic Chemistry II Laboratory (3)\n\nCHM 4906r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nCIS 4933r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nCJE 3617s Cold Case Investigations (3)\n\nCLA 4909r Honors in the Major Research (1-6)\n\nCLA 4935rs Sem"
