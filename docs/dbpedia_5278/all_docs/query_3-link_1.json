        "text": "German Films in the U.S.\n\nGerman Film Office\n\nThe New York-based initiative of the Goethe-Institut and German Films collaborates with local partners to bring the best of contemporary and repertory films from Germany to U.S. audiences.\n\nWatch for free on Goethe On Demand\n\nCITY, COUNTRY, RIVER – A CINEMATIC JOURNEY ACROSS GERMANY\n\nThis free online film series provides an alternative to the cinematic dominance of well-known big cities and embarks on a twelve-month journey through various underrepresented parts of Germany.\n\nPicture Palace\n\nDOK Leipzig 2023\n\nAt the 66th edition of DOK Leipzig, a host of new films was presented. As in previous years, the festival focused on Central and Eastern European film. Goethe-Institut’s Documentary Film Prize was also awarded at the event.\n\nInclusion at the Venice Architecture Biennale\n\nA Red Carpet for All\n\nOpen for Maintenance / Wegen Umbau geöffnet is the title of the German Pavilion at the 18th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice. The pavilion is dedicated to exploring matters of repair, maintenance, accessibility, and inclusion. But what does accessibility mean in a city made up of roughly 120 islands and 359 heritage-protected bridges and whose transport runs mostly on canals? And how inclusive is the Biennale itself?\n\nFilm archive\n\nOur film archive contains films from the beginnings of film in Germany (German Expressionism) to New German Film and the latest German tendencies and productions. Our stock comprises approx. 800 films with a broad collection of feature films, documentaries, short films, children's films and animated films.\n\nIn Conversation with Aldri Anunciação\n\nThe Pain of Colonization\n\nFor Brazilian playwright, actor, and director, Aldri Anunciação, Black cultures of the world come together because of identity. This is evident, for example, in literature, theater, or cinema.\n\nFilm Tourism\n\nThe Hidden Side of Washington, D.C.\n\nTraveling and discovering new places is an adventure that is both exciting and enriching. Traveling as a film tourist adds another layer of fun to the experience, revealing a hidden side to seemingly banal sites.\n\nDEFA Film Heritage\n\n“Did they really allow things like that?”\n\nThe films of the GDR’s state film production company, DEFA, always bore the stigma of being permeated by propaganda. That, however, is only part of the truth. When it comes to feature and animation films, fairy tales and documentaries there is a valuable artistic film legacy to be found. The DEFA Foundation wants to make them more easily available digitally.\n\nBerlinale 2023\n\nA few surprises at the end of the festival\n\nThe audience is back, Steven Spielberg does a dance, and the Golden Bear goes to a French documentary film. What else has been happening at the Berlinale?\n\nOscars 2023\n\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" – except at this year’s Oscars\n\nA German picture picked up four gold statuettes at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. And with that, Edward Berger’s “All Quiet on the Western Front” (Im Westen nichts Neues) has made film history.\n\nA Sustainable Film Industry\n\nThe Show Must Go Green\n\nMany films and documentaries explore environmental issues or call for a more sustainable lifestyle. Is the industry living up to its own values though, and just how green is German film?\n\nSexualised violence on the film set\n\n“If it hasn’t been agreed, it’s not okay!”\n\nAbuse at castings, unannounced rape scenes during filming: the film industry is by no means free of sexualised violence. The new movie directed by Alison Kuhn shows what that does to the parties involved: in “The Case You”, five women who suffered abuse of this nature relate their experiences.\n\nLGBTQI+\n\n“Queer Cinema belongs to the mainstream here”\n\nMonika Treut is considered to be one of the pioneers of Queer Cinema. In this interview the film director and producer talks about positive developments in western societies, repressive trends and things that aren’t quite running as they should.\n\nGeneration Z on the silver screen\n\nThe universal magic of youth\n\nWho are they and how do they live? The advertising and media world has discovered a new target group: Generation Z, fully digitalized since birth, is coming of age. But on screen they are (still) representing the lives of Millennials.\n\nGünter Peter Straschek\n\nWith a Persistent Gaze\n\nThe political turmoil of the 1960s brought his creative work as a filmmaker to an abrupt end. But by then Günter Peter Straschek had already produced one of the seminal works of the student revolts and would ultimately accomplish his life achievement as a film historian.\n\nHito Steyerl\n\nThe essayist filmmaker\n\nIt is hard to confine Hito Steyerl to just one artistic genre: She is a filmmaker, visual artist and author who has made an international name for herself with her socially critical pieces."
