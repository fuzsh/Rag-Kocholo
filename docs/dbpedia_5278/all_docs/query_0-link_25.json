        "text": "MASTER LIST OF FILM COURSES\n\nFILM STUDIES\n\nFILM-ST 170 - Introduction to Film Analysis: Cinematic Time Travel\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nNOTE: This is a combined course, and can be enrolled under either COMP-LIT 170 or Film-ST 197FA.\n\nThis is an introduction to film studies and to the analysis of film. The course explores the complex nature and cultural function of cinema by focusing on time travel as both a central theme of a wide range of films and as a way of understanding how cinema works as a time-based medium. By studying films from various points in the global history of cinema - including films from nine countries and five continents - this course performs a transcultural introduction to the formal and stylistic aspects of cinematic storytelling. (Gen. Ed. AT)\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: I, III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: I\n\nFILM-ST 297SF Special Topics- Possible Futures: Science Fiction in Global Cinemas\n\nKevin Anderson\n\nThere are multiple growing concerns regarding issues of climate, class, race, gender identity, and the nature of democracy in our contemporary world. Science fiction has proven to be a thought-provoking genre to help raise awareness to many of these social and environmental issues. This course takes a global perspective on such pressing issues by examining science fiction films from around the world. As such, the course uses science fiction films as primary texts, accompanied by weekly readings. Students will engage in a critical analysis of the assigned films and readings in order to better appreciate what we can begin to anticipate regarding our future.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G (limit one 200 level course)\n\nFILM-ST 330: Film Auteurs: Akira Kurosawa\n\nCredits 4\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nThis class will focus on one, or more, specific filmmaker and will aim to highlight their cinematic models, distinctive style and recurrent themes, within the theoretical framework of the \"auteur theory\", thus offering students an introductory and comprehensive view of perhaps the most central concept in film studies. In the first place, this class will address the historical evolution of the debate around \"auteur theory,\" from the \"politique des auteurs\" to the \"death of the author\", while providing author criticism and analysis in practice. It will tackle questions such as: Why do certain filmmakers qualify as auteurs? What is the difference between commercial cinema and auteur cinema? Due to the collaborative nature of filmmaking, can we talk about the author of a film? What is the intersection between gender and authorship? What does it mean to be a woman author? Secondly, it will concentrate on one specific filmmaker: students will read pertinent bibliography (e.g. biography, film reviews, etc.) on their films, watch and study their most significant film production, and contextualize it historically, geographically and culturally.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY:III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 383 - Narrative Avant-Garde Film\n\nInstructor: Don Levine\n\nFocus on narrative problems of love, desire, sexual identity, daily life, and death. These films' investigations of how we might gain distance on our life fictions by questioning and undermining viewer identification with narrative. (Gen.Ed. AT)\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H2\n\nFILM-ST 391SF- International Sci-Fi Cinema\n\nChristopher NC Couch\n\nThis course provides an introduction to science fiction cinema from the end of the nineteenth century to today. Beginning with the experiments of the Melies Brothers and the importance of German Expressionist films like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the course considers technological prognostication from Destination Moon to 2001: A Space Odyssey, adventure and science fiction in films like Forbidden Planet and Star Wars, and the dystopian imagination from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to District 9. The course will also highlight the roles of women writers and directors from Thea von Harbou to Kathryn Bigelow, and technological cinematic advances from matte painting and process shots to CGI.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 397A- ST Alien Encounters\n\n3 credits Daniel Pope\n\nCould extraterrestrial life exist in the cosmos? Scientists say yes, possibly on billions of planets in our galaxy alone. In this class, we will examine the international cinema of alien encounters and explore how these films envision the alien other. How do these films both reflect and shape our own experience of \"the alien\" or the unknown \"other\"? Since the beginning of cinema, the figure of the alien has visited the big screen with its promise of otherworldly wonders and its threat of unthinkable perils. This course will explore how alien encounters reflect the haunting of historical realities (such as European voyages of discovery, conquest, and colonization) as well as contemporary issues, such as international conflict (war or global migration), questions of identity (race, gender, sexuality), and the power and perils of emerging technologies (nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, space travel). Imagining encounters with intelligent beings beyond our own cultural and ideological sphere provides powerful new perspectives on what we think we know about the world, about ourselves, and about others.\n\nIf you have trouble enrolling please contact the professor at daniel@umass.edu\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 397E: Film at the End of the World\n\nCredits: 3\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nClimate disaster, world war, aliens, cosmic collisions, dystopias, zombies, the rise of the machines, catastrophic pandemics, mass extinction, prophesied apocalypse. What do films about the end of the world tell us about contemporary realities? What insights do they offer into the cultural moment that produces them and the prevailing attitudes and realities of gender, race, class, sexuality, and gender identity? How do they speak to our anxieties and fears about the future as well as our hopes and aspirations? How does the genre of end-of-the-world films intersect with other genres—thriller, action film, neo-noir, comedy, art-house, romance, drama, experimental, historical? In this course we will study the cinema of eschatology, of ultimate endings, and analyze a range of filmic approaches to the philosophical, psychological, social, and aesthetic questions posed in end-of-the-world films.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 397F- Portuguese Speaking World in Film\n\nPatricia Ferreira\n\nThis course is designed as an introduction to Brazilian, Portuguese and Lusophone African cinema and cultures. The selected cinematographic works will afford students an opportunity to engage with film theory and criticism, and to examine a variety of topics such as the formation of national identity, gender and family dynamics, social inequalities, rural vs. urban societies, migration, civic agency, race relations, and major political and historical events that have impacted the contemporary societies of the Portuguese-speaking world (mainly Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé e Príncipe). Our goal is to evaluate how film can contest hegemonic accounts and to investigate how artistic productions play a role in interpreting one's society and forming one's identity. Class will be conducted in English. The films will be shown in the original language with subtitles. UNDERGRADUATE UNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 397G: Contemporary Hispanic Cinema\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3\n\nCap 15 (of 25, Cap of 10 be listed as SPANISH 397B)\n\nThis course gathers together an array of recent Latin American, Spanish, Caribbean, and Latinx films with an emphasis on addressing the experiences of marginalized people, with an emphasis on questions of gender, class, race, and sexual and gender identity. We will explore the historical and cultural contexts in which these films are made and seen, in many cases reaching vast audiences across the world, and we will push at the boundaries of the category “Hispanic” in cinema. Analysis and discussions will also draw on insights from film theory, such as approaches to world cinema, “Third Cinema,” national and transnational cinemas, and Hamid Naficy’s concept of “accented cinema.” Taught in English with films subtitled in English. Spanish majors encouraged to submit written work in Spanish. Cross-listed with SPANISH 397B, Pre-requisites: none.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 397V- Latin American Cinema\n\n3 credits Barbara Zecchi\n\nThe course is designed to introduce students to the cinematic work of some of the most important Latin American directors. The course will center on a variety of topics that are vital to the understanding of the most significant political, historical, social and cultural events that have shaped Latin America.\n\nCross-listed with Spanish\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 397Z: Classical Hollywood Cinema\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nCap: 25\n\nThis is a history of film course focusing on what is sometimes referred to as the “Golden Age” of Hollywood. An examination of classical Hollywood cinema, this course will concentrate on the period from the 1920s to the 1960s. We will look at the production and distribution practices of the Hollywood studio system, and pay special attention to the way this preeminent form of cinema established many of the norms of the immersive film experience. Among other subjects, we will consider the construction of classical continuity by studying the narrative structures and devices, stylistic techniques, and approaches to editing of a wide range of exemplary films. Weekly in-class screenings, with separate discussion.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H1\n\nFILM-ST 470- FILM THEORY\n\nBarry Spence 4 credits\n\nThis course provides an in-depth overview of key theoretical approaches to the study of cinema by examining historically significant ways of analyzing film form and its social and cultural functions and effects. The course seeks to equip students with a command of the diverse history of theoretical frameworks for understanding the medium and experience of cinema, from early concerns over films relation to other arts to the way the movie as a cultural form has been reconceptualized within the contemporary explosion of new media. The pressing relevance of film theory becomes clear once we stop to consider taking just one small example the many implications of a society-wide movement away from the collective experience of movies in a public theater to private viewing with earbuds on the tiny screen of a cell phone or tablet. We will explore a wide range of questions (concerning the nature of the cinematic medium and its apparatus, aspects of the spectator’s experience of film, and the aesthetic and ideological dimensions of film genre, to name just a few) as a way of putting ourselves in dialogue with various film theoreticians. And we will ground our examination by looking at cinematic practice in relation to theory. This will be done through regular film screenings throughout the semester. UNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: T\n\nFILM-ST - 497AC/697AC: Arthouse Cinema 1950-1980\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nCap: 20; 3 Credits\n\nThis course will examine the cultural phenomenon of the “art film” during the first three decades of the postwar period (1950s, 60s, 70s). The nature and characteristics of, as well as the relationships connecting and distinguishing, modernist cinema, art cinema, and avant-garde film during this vital period in film history will be the course’s primary concern. We will examine the notion of the auteur and consider its usefulness for thinking about this multiform, innovative cinema. What is the relationship between cinematic modernism and the core principles and representational strategies of modern art? Does modern cinema, as Gilles Deleuze suggests, function as a mental substitute for the lost connection between the individual and the world? Can it restore our belief in the world? The course will pay particular attention to distinctive stylistic attributes, but will also look at dominant thematic concerns. There will be weekly in-class screenings as well as regular streaming of films outside of class. The filmmakers we will consider include, but are not limited to: Chantal Ackerman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Theo Angelopoulos, Ingmar Bergman, Stan Brakhage, Robert Bresson, Luis Buñuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Peter Greenaway, Werner Herzog, Miklós Janscó, Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi, Yasujiro Ozu, Sergei Paradzhanov, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Alain Resnais, Jean-Marie Straub, Andrei Tarkovsky, François Truffaut, Agnès Varda, Wim Wenders.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H2\n\nFILM-ST 497B - Contemporary Hispanic Cinema\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCap: 15; 3 Credits\n\nThis course gathers together an array of recent Latin American, Spanish, Caribbean, and Latinx films with an emphasis on addressing the experiences of marginalized people. We will explore the historical and cultural contexts in which these films are made and seen, in many cases reaching vast audiences across the world, and we will push at the boundaries of the category “Hispanic” in cinema. Analysis and discussions will also draw on insights from film theory, such as approaches to world cinema, “Third Cinema,” national and transnational cinemas, and Hamid Naficy’s concept of “accented cinema.” Taught in English with films subtitled in English. Spanish majors encouraged to submit written work in Spanish. Cross-listed with SPANISH 497B, Pre-requisites: none.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 497N – New York on Film\n\n3 Credits\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence, Cap: 15\n\nThree MANDATORY field trips to New York City (see below)\n\nILC S404\n\nPrerequisite: This course is designed for Film Certificate students or for those with previous experience studying film. Please contact the professor, if you have any questions.\n\n\"New York on Film\" is a course offered under the auspices of the New York Professional Outreach Program (NYPOP), College of Humanities & Fine Arts. New York City's celluloid skylines have long been a crucible for the seventh art. On the one hand, this course examines the role of NYC in a wide range of films; on the other hand, it considers NYC as a cultural center for the production of cinema. We will explore multiple representations of the city's dramatic streetscapes and hidden histories, international and multiethnic spaces, architecture and landscapes, with a focus on shifting portrayals of the city from the silent era to the present in diverse genres and temporalities. How do filmmakers of different classes, races, and genders represent social and cultural spaces? What is the role of the city in the creative, programming, exhibition, and distribution process? What interactions take place between film artists and the city's infrastructure? The course will include weekly screenings of narrative fiction, documentary, and experimental genres inspired by, set in, and designed with New York in mind. Required readings will complement these screenings.\n\nThe central field component of this course will involve three trips to New York City: a daytrip on Feb 8 (Friday), and two overnight trips March 1-2 and April 12-13 (both on Friday-Saturday). On these trips we will: attend film screenings at iconic and culturally significant cinemas; visit museums such as the American Museum of the Moving Image and the Museum of Modern Art; tour an independent film production company; connect with film professionals; experience the architecture, food, and vibrant street life of one of the most cinematic cultural capitals of the world.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Attendance on all three trips is mandatory. For each trip there will be a bus chartered by the College of Humanities and Fine Arts. The cost to students for each (roundtrip) bus trip is $25.\n\nIn addition, students must find their own accommodations during the two overnight trips.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 497V – Video Essay in Film Criticism\n\nDaniel Pope Cap. 14, 3 Credits\n\nThis is a course in planning, scripting, and editing video essays in film criticism, working with films from around the world and across film history. The field of film criticism is taking new forms in recent years, with social media, podcasts, websites and blogs dedicated to analyzing and discussing movies. Out of this trend, the video essay emerges as an exceptionally attractive and powerful medium for the film critic. In this class, we examine a wide array of video essays and explore the unique analytical and expressive opportunities the medium offers. A primary emphasis in the course is the study and practice of film criticism as an intellectual and creative endeavor with its own particular objectives, challenges, and expressive powers. With this foundation, we develop the critical, creative, and technical skills necessary for making effective video essays addressing films, directors, genres, national cinemas, and cultural and social issues. Making a video essay is in many ways like making a movie. As such we are engaged not only in film analysis and film writing but also in video editing, image composition, sound design, and other aspects of moving image media.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 497W: Film Writing and Criticism in the Age of New Media\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3\n\nThis is both a writing class for movie-lovers and a film class for writers interested in new media. With cinema touching nearly every corner of popular and intellectual culture, new varieties of film writing have flourished along with it. From thinking about what cinema is (and what it can be) to personal explorations of cinema, we will dive into the exciting new opportunities for film criticism, from the force of the critical essay and the art of the film review to the rapidly evolving landscape of new media—video essays, podcasts, websites, social media, blogs, and other engagements with film. The core work of this class focuses on discovering our own compelling insights into films and film art from around the world and from different eras of cinema and then expressing those discoveries effectively in moving images, written words, and audio experiences for diverse audiences.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: junior year writing\n\nFILM-ST 597E – Strange Engagements-Figural Realism in Film and Literature\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCourse Description TBA\n\nFILM-ST 597V- ST-Videographic Essay\n\n3 credits Daniel Pope\n\nWhat is possible when the mode of film scholarship departs from the printed word and inhabits the form of the media it examines? As the media environment evolves, engagements with film are branching out, with promising adaptation to niches in the digital landscape - social media, podcasting, websites and blogs, etc.- and out of this field, the videographic essay emerges as a powerful medium for the film scholar. This is a course in planning, scripting, and editing videographic essays in film scholarship. Making a videographic essay is much like making a film, often with similarities to documentary and the essay film. As such, we will engage not only film analysis and film scholarship but also video editing, visual composition, sound design, and other aspects of moving image media. In this class, we examine a wide array of videographic essays and explore the unique analytical and expressive opportunities the medium offers. With this foundation, we develop the critical, creative, and technical skills necessary for making effective video essays addressing films and film theory, directors, genres, national cinemas, and cultural and sociological issues.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 797C: Catalan Cinema - a stateless national film production\n\nInstructor: Barbara Zecchi\n\nCap: 6 students for Film-ST from a cap of 12\n\nThe goal of this class is to give visibility to a film production that is generally assimilated by,and shoehorned into, Spanish film production. If there is a commonsense understanding of what a national cinema is, what about a stateless national cinema? Catalan cinema is often relegated to a footnote or a compulsory chapter in books on Spanish cinema, even though Spanish cinema would be inconceivable without Catalan film production. Just as early feminist theory called for a “countercinema,” early radical Latin American theory for an “imperfect cinema,” and Hamid Naficy for an “accented cinema,” so Catalan cinema cries out for a reevaluation of cinematic models and protocols. Is Catalan cinema an imperfect, minoritarian, colonized, accented countercinema? Does it have its own idiosyncrasies? This class aims at answering these and other questions by offering an overview of the history of Catalan cinema from the pioneering days to the present. Particular emphasis will be given to \"auteurs\" such as Joaquín Jordà, Ventura Pons, Bigas Luna, Pere Portabella, and Isabel Coixet; the avant-gardist Escola de Barcelona, that provoked belligerent rejections like no other film movement; the clandestine production during the Franco dictatorship (Helena Lumbreras and her Class Cinema Collective, or Pere Portabella's early works); the creative documentary of the Pompeu Fabra; and the new generation of women filmmakers (Neus Ballús, Carla Simón, Elena Martí, among others).\n\nYou can also take film related courses from other departments, such as:\n\nART\n\nART 230 – Image Capturing\n\nSusan Jahoda Cap: 12, 3 Credits\n\nIntroduction to photographic tools and methods.

We will screen a wide variety of films, including Basic Instinct, Disney's Aladdin, and Jennifer's Body. We will use intersectional feminist theory, film theory, and queer theory to examine how race, gender, sexuality, and disability are used to construct images of danger, badness, and villainy. Course content will explore and critique harmful tropes of bisexuality as dangerous and trans identity depicted as inherently deceptive, as well as examining how villains were historically queer- coded in Hollywood film. We will view and analyze films that construct whiteness as goodness and use representations of people of color as a stand-in for villainous character traits. We will look at the stigmatizing of mental illness and representations of people who look \"different\" as ways that ableism emerges in cinematic representation. Films that resist stereotypes and tropes will be viewed to offer a counterpoint to theses representations and to explore ways in which film can be used to present and change narratives around representations.\n\nCourse Notes: This class meets in person on Monday and convenes online on Wednesday. The online session doesn't have a meeting time; film viewing, and online activities should be done by Wed. at 11:59 p.m. EST.

Close analysis of texts is a foundational method within many disciplinary approaches and an especially central approach to both film and media studies, producing exemplary case studies as well as the basis for more expansive inquiries. This course will offer an exploration of the intellectual foundations of textual studies and a careful consideration of theories of textuality. It will seek to revisit and reconsider the media text amid twenty-first century practices of seriality and transmedia franchise building, global interconnectivity, digital production and distribution, and intersubjective consumption, in which the boundaries of textuality are forever changing and porous. It will consider the text as discourse, the text as social practice, the text as data, the text as cognition, and the text as site of evolving technogenesis. Participants in the course will develop skills in the analysis and interpretation of media texts through approaches to form, structure, narrative, and genre; the ability to identify and understand medium specificity; experience with both \"close reading\" and \"distant reading\" practices; and a recognition of and familiarity with the critical frameworks from which these are all explicitly or implicitly drawn.\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: T\n\nCOMPARATIVE LITERATURE\n\nCOMP-LIT 170 - Introduction to Film Analysis: Cinematic Time Travel\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nNOTE: This is a combined course, and can be enrolled under either COMP-LIT 170 or FILM-ST 170.\n\nThis is an introduction to film studies and to the analysis of film.

And we will consider in equal measure the so-called dystopian film. We will look at the interrelationship connecting these two modes, which can be seen at work in films like Battle Royale. This course will include a primary focus on gender issues, will examine the representation of women, and will screen (transgressive) examples of these modes by women filmmakers. The intention of this course is to expose students to a cultural diversity of these vital contemporary film genres beyond the conventional Hollywood fare.

Trying to determine if film is the most resolutely modern of them media, we’ll look at cinema as the result of two obsessive concerns 1.) The poetic, dreamlike and fantastic 2.) The factual, realistic and socially critical or anarchistic. Thus, we’ll attempt to discover how modern culture deals with avant-garde imperatives to always “make it new.” Films and filmmakers such as Breathless (Godard), My Own Private Idaho (Van Sant), The American Soldier (Fassbinder), others.

The course will also highlight the roles of women writers and directors from Thea von Harbou to Kathryn Bigelow, and technological cinematic advances from matte painting and process shots to CGI.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nCOMP-LIT 391W - Dream, History, & Identity in Polish Film\n\nCap: 15; 3 Credits\n\nWhat happens when a nation \"dreams\" itself, when it projects an image of its identity and uses it to negotiate its socio-historic predicament? Perhaps modern Polish cinema, which rose from the ashes of the Holocaust and World War II and in a new communist age, offers as good a case study as any of this important question. In the course of this class, we will look at Polish history as mediated through the lens of film, in works by Wanda Jakubowska, Andrzej Wajda, Wojciech Jerzy Has, Andrzej Munk, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Roman Polanski, Jerzy Skolimowski, Krzysztof Zanussi, Agnieszka Holland, and more recent filmmakers such as Malgorzata Szumowska, Wladyslaw Pasikowski, Wojciech Smarzowski, and Pawel Pawlikowski, who have also more readily addressed social and psychosexual norms, applying a queering lens to traditional motifs, including family, the church, death and sexuality. Accompanying these works is the notion that the very act of recreating history necessarily transforms it into something else. In these diverse \"dreams of Poland\" and of Polish identity - some more serene, some more hallucinatory - we will also get a better sense of what Deleuze meant when he warned of getting lost in someone else's dream.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFRENCH\n\nFRENCH 350 - French Film\n\nInstructor: Emmanuel Buzay\n\nCap: 100; 4 Credits\n\nThis French film survey course in English will introduce a variety of French films (with English subtitles) of different genres dating from the 1930s to the present, which we will interpret on their own terms, in relation to other films, and with respect to their specific historical contexts of time and place.
