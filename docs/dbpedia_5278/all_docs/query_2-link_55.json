        "text": "Down the road from Woodstock in the early 1970s, a revolution blossomed in a ramshackle summer camp for disabled teenagers, transforming their young lives and igniting a landmark movement.\n\nWith joy and humor, Crip Camp√Ç explores the universal experience of summer camp awakenings that would transform lives and shape the future of the disability rights movement. Told from the point of view of Co-Director and former camper Jim LeBrecht, the film traces the journeys of campers and staff up to the present day, in this compelling and untold story of a powerful movement towards inclusion.\n\nCrip Camp is unlike any documentary about disability that has preceded it. With sex, drugs and rock and roll and from the universal, tender perspective of adolescence, the film will take viewers deep inside a revolutionary era and on a wild trip: a ride from oppression to empowerment, from infantilization to freedom - the trip of a lifetime."
