        "text": "Diego Arispe-Bazán: The argument of the book hinges on the concepts of communicative care and convivencia (living together). How did you identify these phenomena ethnographically, and how have they helped you conceptualize your research?\n\nLynette Arnold: Living Together Across Borders explores how members of transnational families find ways to convivir (live together) despite sustained cross-border separation. Convivencia is central to how people in rural El Salvador understand relationships. Families, co-workers, classmates, and even entire villages, dedicate significant effort to set aside times and spaces for convivencia. Sometimes these are large convivios (gatherings) or other events to mark specific holidays (Mother’s Day, Easter Week, the annual community anniversary, and so on), but they can also take the form of more everyday rituals such as visiting together and sharing meals. When I interviewed members of transnational families, both in El Salvador and the United States, many mentioned that they missed the ways they used to convivir with loved ones. But at the same time, from participating in these transnational networks, I knew that families were still finding ways to convivir despite borders and that language was central to these efforts. In talking on the phone to relatives in both countries, I noticed regular moments of convivencia as we reminisced about the past, laughed at jokes or the antics of our children, congratulated or comforted one another, and imagined the future.\n\nMy research aimed to trace this cross-border convivencia more closely. I collaborated with two extended families to gather recordings of their transnational phone calls. When I started to analyze the recordings, it became clear to me that their communicative labor was most accurately characterized in terms of care. I understand care as a practice for sustaining life and wellbeing. The book argues that language is crucial to care, not only because it facilitates practical and material care (like sending gifts or remittances), but also because it can itself enact care, forging and maintaining the relational bedrock that is the foundation of all care. At the same time, people use language to make sense of care, specifying which actions, enacted by whom, in which contexts, count as care. With the term communicative care, I bring together these different relationships into a single framework which suggests that language facilitates, enacts, and signifies care. The book demonstrates that this approach sheds light on how transnational families live together across borders through language.\n\nDiego Arispe-Bazán: Against the adage of “actions speak louder than words” your book demonstrates that talk is social action. This is most clear in your analysis of family as a process, (re)created through interactions of care. How would you say your work extends linguistic anthropology and anthropology writ large’s theorizations of kinship?\n\nLynette Arnold: As your question suggests, my approach to kinship in this book is deeply informed by scholarship that understands family as something that is actively produced, rather than as a pre-given biological structure. I am thinking here of feminist work on reproductive labor that highlights the work of family life and also queer scholarship on chosen family, which has challenged a presumptive biological basis for kinship. In addition, anthropological work on practices of kinwork and relatedness have also deeply informed my thinking.\n\nMy contribution to this scholarship is to show that language, in the form of everyday conversations within the family, is absolutely crucial to the way that family is done. For those who face seemingly permanent separation from their loved ones, often without the possibility of visits, language is a central resource through which they continually work to constitute themselves as family.\n\nMy long-term research over several years allowed me to see how families used language to sustain themselves over time. In-the-moment uses of language became ways of maintaining family through individual life-course transitions and across generations. The book includes the story of two brothers, who lived in El Salvador when I began my research but who later migrated. Learning how to use language in new ways—for instance, responding to remittance requests—was part of how they began to live into being migrant members of the family. In another example, young children were taught to send greetings to migrant kin they had never met, socializing them into cross-border family life and their place in it. Interestingly, the children of migrants didn’t receive this same socialization, with profound implications for how transnational families will be maintained across generations.\n\nAs it makes family, language thus shapes the individual life-course while also producing particular family configurations that include some and exclude others. This is particularly clear when families are not together in the same place, but I would argue that language is relevant for the production of kinship no matter the context.\n\nDiego Arispe-Bazán: I am very interested in your explanation of how nationalism, as moral impetus, gets laminated onto relationships of care within interactions between transnational family members. Have you ever noticed a breakdown or a rejection of nationalism’s assumptions during your research?\n\nLynette Arnold: The first chapter of the book looks at 30 years of state-endorsed discourses about migration in El Salvador. I show that in the face of shifting geopolitical conditions, these discourses consistently mobilize heteropatriarchal ideas of family care to call migrants to different nation building projects—whether rebuilding the nation after the civil war, sustaining the national economy through remittances, or becoming “working ambassadors” who represent the upstanding Salvadoran national character in the face of racist discourses in the US that target Central Americans. Regardless of the project, the call to migrants is to embody being good citizens by caring for their nation as they would for their family.\n\nThese discourses profoundly shape how transnational family members interact with one another. For instance, the expectation that migrants must be economic providers for the family was deeply embedded in normative ideas about how certain forms of communication should unfold: who should say what, to whom, and when. Nevertheless, families did not interpret family providing as a nationalist project. In fact, migrants instead often signified their care as motivated by intergenerational reciprocity, as a way of ‘paying back’ the care their parents had provided to them. So at the level of signification there was some resistance to the state-endorsed merging of family provision with participation in the nation. But this was also enacted in practice through the many ways that migrant relatives engaged in non-economic forms of care. Looking closely at these phone calls revealed so much emotional and relational care, and I was particularly struck by the ways that male migrants communicatively cared for their male relatives. I suggest in the book that these everyday practices of communicative care are a form of subtle contestation of nationalist projects that would co-opt family care to its own ends.\n\nDiego Arispe-Bazán: In chapters 4 and 5 you describe practices of dialogism between transnational family members in building proximity. Can you say more about how gender roles affected this linguistic/discursive phenomenon?\n\nLynette Arnold: In both of these chapters, I present a close analysis of communicative practices that happen regularly in transnational conversations.Chapter 4 shows how family members develop new genres for managing remittance requests, in which non-migrant relatives used complaints to elicit particular kinds of responses from their migrant kin. In remittance negotiations, family members generally adhere to genre conventions regardless of their gender or that of their interlocutor: what shapes how people engage in these interactions more strongly is whether they are migrants or non-migrants.\n\nThe relevance of migration also manifests in the collaborative reminiscing I analyze in Chapter 5, though here the focus is on dialogism in the form of syntax, where interlocutors take up and recycle one another’s phrasing in order to build interactional alignments. While I cannot make conclusive statements about gender given the general underrepresentation of women migrants among my participants, gender did seem to matter for this collaborative remembering practice. People seemed more likely to engage in these joint reminiscences with same-gender interlocutors. Remembering together enacts affective and relational carework, so this may perhaps explain the same-gender preference.\n\nUltimately, these chapters show that men do engage in relational and emotional care, contra to discourses that cast them only as economic providers. This disjuncture between gender ideologies and practices is perhaps not surprising, but reveals the importance of looking closely at how gender is enacted through language, not just how gender roles are described. Of course, gender ideologies do continue to matter. My book shows that care within transnational families is inequitably distributed. Chapter 2 describes how intergenerational care—including communicative labor—is organized in ways that often assign the most thankless and onerous care work to women. But women sometimes used this communicative care work to claim greater space in family decision-making processes. Thus, specific practices of communicative care can be analyzed to gain greater insight into how gendered ideologies and practices coincide and also where there are disjunctures that might provide leverage for change.\n\nDiego Arispe-Bazán: Ethnographic intimacy as both concept and experience comes through in your project. How would you say you feature this in the book, both as ethnographer and writer? Would you say there is something particular about intimacy in the ethnographic context for linguistic anthropologists, given that our focus is specifically upon language and communication?\n\nLynette Arnold: I love this question so much! Thank you for asking it!\n\nThe research on which this book is based was quite intimate, most obviously because of its focus on everyday family conversations. But it is also deeply personal to me because it was to some extent motivated by my struggles to navigate my own very different experience of family separation. I write about this in the preface, and doing so was certainly an exercise in vulnerability, which I think is a crucial for building intimacy. The research was also based on close relationships with many of the participants whom I have known for over two decades now. We have supported each other through many life challenges, and within these ongoing relationships, my research was incorporated as part of families’ cross-border care endeavors.\n\nAll of these experiences and relationships are part of the voice of this book, of why I wrote it as I did and why I am present in the book in the ways that I am. The book aims to be deeply humanizing: not eliding the immense challenges that transnational families face but also honoring the creative ways that they navigate seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In an era of intense anti-immigrant sentiment that often targets Central Americans and criminalizes family ties, the close relationships I had with participants motivated a certain kind of focus and storytelling. I worked hard to make the book accessible to readers outside of linguistic anthropology, and also created a teaching guide which includes key terms and discussion questions for each chapter.\n\nAs to the question about disciplinary intimacies in ethnographic work within the field, I hesitate to make any blanket statements, because linguistic anthropologists approach their work in different ways, with a range of motivations and relationships. But I do think that the methods used in ethnographic studies of language and communication can open the door to intimacy. Recording interactions in whatever setting brings us into people’s lives in profound ways. So I’d say our disciplinary orientation can be an invitation to intimacy. Whether we choose to accept this invitation is up to us, but from this research, I can’t imagine any other way to do this work!\n\nhttps://www.dukeupress.edu/incommunicable\n\nDaniel Krugman: This book is clearly a cumulation of thinking throughout your career arriving at a generative and fruitful apex. When was the first moment incommunicability as an analytic became clear to you and you knew it had to be developed further?\n\nCharles Briggs: I am interested to learn that Incommunicable provides you with a sense of continuity and linearity in my work. Indeed, it does return to issues that have engaged me for years. However, viewing it from the inside, I have a strong feeling of discontinuity, of rupture. Embodying how much I enjoy arguing with myself, questioning and disrupting points at which my thinking has come to rest, I see Incommunicable as disavowing or at least significantly reorienting much of my work during the past fifteen years.\n\nI had become convinced that an enduring chasm between research on language/communication and health/medicine ran cover for ways that fundamental conceptions underlying research in both areas were deeply—and problematically—entwined. Like the sense of dis-ease with existing scholarship that prompted Dick Bauman and I to spend over a decade writing Voices of Modernity, I felt a profound sense of discomfort, but was unable to pinpoint its source, much less see a way out. My impatience was at least as centered on my own thinking as on the work of anyone else. I would have liked to bring this project together earlier, but I was not ready.\n\nAn initial point of reorientation came in reading new biographical and historical work on a figure who has held me reluctantly transfixed for decades, John Locke. These sources enabled me to dig deeper into his writing about medicine, his medical practice, and his collaboration with leading physician Thomas Syndenham. Neatly covering up his medical work in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and constructing language and science as “separate provinces of knowledge” helped Locke create the boundary between these topics that persists in both scholarship and practice. Two insights helped push my thinking here. One was that Locke’s medical work structured his account of language as an anxious nosology of communicative pathologies, just as his empiricist, atheoretical, observational approach to language helped shape his medical practice. Second, this deep imbrication was augmented by a common racializing logic that disembodied language and universalized bodies, even as white, European, male, elite, adult, non-disabled bodies were projected as privileged subjects of language and medicine.\n\nThe work of Hortense Spillers and Savannah Shange further engendered a rupture and reorientation. Shange suggested that “Black girl flesh spills forth in excess of the discourses that seek to locate it, to know it, to translate its ‘noncommunicability'” (2019: 96). I was struck by the way she and Audra Simpson (2014) analyzed how racialized individuals and populations used ethnographic refusal in challenging demands that they gain the status of liberal subjects by assimilating white logics. Shange’s trenchant analysis of how the violence of racialization entails a priori judgments of what I came to call incommunicability helped me realize that constructions of communicability were deeply enmeshed with white supremacy, racism, and colonialism, even when they were used to critique linguistic racial projects. Grasping these imbrications prompted me to face how my own preoccupation with communicability was rooted in white privilege.\n\nDaniel Krugman: The dynamic relationship between communicability, incommunicability, and biocommunicability is central to your project. Can you give a brief overview of these three ideas and what you hope readers take away about how they interact with each other?\n\nCharles Briggs: I fashioned the term communicability in 2005, bringing together medical notions of how pathogens travel infectiously between organisms and how semiotic forms purportedly move between people, media, and genres and achieve intelligibility. I use it not to refer to seemingly objective cartographies but to cultural (or ideological) models. I was drawn to how health professionals project this relationship as inverse in pandemics: the more health communication moves in prescribed ways, the less viruses or bacteria should circulate. Communicability crystalizes Locke’s semiotic regime for making signs perfectly mobile, moving across people and contexts while retaining meaning and transparency. The term also captured the negative side of Locke’s program, labeling semiotic processes that do not purportedly achieve communicable perfection as pathological, stigmatizing those associated with them as not fully human. It captured how linguistic anthropologists, sociolinguistics, linguists, and others critically analyzed how perceived forms of linguistic difference provided bases for naturalizing categories of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, nation, and disability.\n\nIn biomedicine, communicability confers legitimacy on particular discursive forms and processes, casting others as irrational or ignorant. Hallin and I referred to this process of joining biomedical and communicative hegemony as biocommunicability (Briggs and Hallin 2016). I have been particularly concerned with how biocommunicability constructs health inequities as resulting from the projected communicative failures of patients and populations. Hallin and I also analyzed biomediatization, how media logics, practices, and institutions became imbricated with those of biomedicine, as evident, for example, in health journalism, pharmaceutical advertising, and digital health.\n\nThese concepts are limited by how they leave communicability as an analytic prime. Starting with incommunicability reoriented my work in three ways. First, it suggested that incommunicability is not an inherent feature of defective subjects but is produced by regimes of communicability, even as the stigma of incommunicability banishes people from the status of modern, rational, liberal subjects. Second, Shange’s and Simpson’s work documented how subjects stigmatized as incommunicable can inhabit incommunicability, thereby refusing communicability’s positioning as the primordial grounds for defining and evaluating subjects. Finally, incommunicability becomes the foundational analytic, displacing communicability. Rather than positing a binary between the two, I reposition communicability within incommunicability, thereby dislodging communicability from ideological dominance.\n\nDaniel Krugman: Coming to anthropology from public health myself, I know how important it is for global public health professionals to be given practical actions. In the book, you talk about “incommunicability free zones” and building toward a “post- incommunicable world.” Briefly, what do these concepts mean, and how can public health professionals begin to create these realities in their work?\n\nCharles Briggs: I think it would be useful to approach this question through the book’s analysis of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic. Despite dedicated efforts by health professionals and avalanches of media attention, the outcome was catastrophic, leaving health communication utterly broke. Nearly half of the U.S. population rejects anything health officials say; even people who embraced guidelines now tune out much proffered advice. Beyond COVID-19, although health inequities have formed a major focus of research and policy formulation, they seem more entrenched than ever. I thus think that a large dose of humility is in order.\n\nOne of the central conclusions of the book is that failing to grapple with the synergistic effects of health and communicative inequities results in policies and practices—even progressive and community-based ones—that produce incommunicability. If you treat your interlocutors—whether individuals, small groups, or mediatized populations—as having nothing to contribute to addressing the problems that they experience intimately, building trust and connection seems unlikely. An alternative is to take health/communicative design problems seriously. Ask: does this poster, website, presentation, or media presentation create unequal, hierarchically-defined roles? Does it implicitly enhance my power and authority at the expense of my projected audience? Does it inadvertently stereotype or even stigmatize the people it is designed to benefit? I draw on grassroots and social movement efforts and the impressive work of critical health communication scholar Mohan Dutta (2010) in exploring how heterogeneous registers, forms of knowledge, and practices can be brought into horizontally-organized dialogues. Given how the presuppositions and routinized forms of knowledge production associated with academic disciplines and professional specializations often limit creativity and real change, collaborations between clinicians, public health professionals, linguistic and medical anthropologists, and members of populations facing acute health inequities are needed to disrupt the weight of received perspectives and practices.\n\nDaniel Krugman: As a central aim of this book is bridging Linguistic/Medical Anthropology, what do you see as the future of this growing subfield and what role do you hope Incommunicable will play in it?\n\nCharles Briggs: One of the problems with disciplinary and subdisciplinary boundaries is how they foster reifying canons and genealogies. Beyond the issue of reproducing racialized and other hierarchies and mechanisms of exclusion, this process also draws attention away from work that crosses and challenges such divides. I have tried to highlight some examples here. Fanon analysis of how colonial physicians stigmatized colonized patients by using an imaginary language to construct them as incommunicable provides a driving force behind the book. Incommunicable also highlights a growing and quite exciting body of scholarship published during the past decade and a half that works fruitfully between linguistic and medical anthropology.\n\nMy interest has never been in simply combining two existing subfields of anthropology. Digging deeply into linguistic and medical anthropology rather affords opportunities to excavate entrenched presuppositions and explore the constraints and problematic reifications hidden in fundamental concepts and modes of inquiry. One goal in writing Incommunicable was to demonstrate the potential of boundary-crossing work to exert transformative effects on linguistic anthropology—even for researchers who have not previously explored health-related topics—and on medical anthropology—even for scholars who have not previously seen how language-centered work might produce new horizons. I believe that this emerging research agenda could become a model for helping to break down other entrenched borders between modes of anthropological research.\n\nA limiting factor—which I have seen up close on many occasions—is how departmental tracks promote the recruitment of graduate students and faculty hires in keeping with bounded subdisciplinary interests. The result is often excluding candidates whose goal is to work between subdisciplines. Even when openness exists, it is not easy for graduate students to find models for navigating the relatively uncharted waters that separate subdisciplinary islands. My hope is that the initial philosophical chapters, the focus on “doctor-patient interaction” research and global public health communication, and the extended example I offer of the COVID-19 pandemic might spark conversations in graduate seminars and as early-career researchers design their own projects. I am convinced that critical syntheses of language- and health-centered perspectives can deepen and broaden ethnographic inquiry and augment analytic acuity. My hope is that Incommunicable will further catalyze this rising body of research and demonstrate its value for medical and linguistic anthropology and other fields.\n\nReferences Cited:\n\nBriggs, Charles L. and Daniel C.

But I want to start with a particular note you make in the introduction: “in algorithmic systems, these “cultural” details are technical details” (7). What does that mean, for you, and how does that principle guide your study of music recommender systems?\n\nNick Seaver: Thanks for the great question. This gets at the heart of what I’m trying to do in the book, and what I’ve argued for in most of my writing about algorithmic systems. There’s a prominent discourse out there that imagines “algorithms” as being essentially inhuman, pursuing some kind of uniquely technical, economic, or mathematical goals. Many people would suggest that this is what makes algorithms harmful to “culture”—all those antihuman logics chop culture into little bits, distort it, and feed it back to us in grotesque form. What I’ve argued is that this does not really account for how algorithms exist in practice: especially in the case of recommender systems like we see in the book, there are humans all over the place deciding how things work, choosing between different options, setting goals, and actively worrying about their cultural role. In contemporary software development, algorithms change all the time as a result of these interventions, and these interventions are shaped by all sorts of “non-technical” ideas held by people. So, as I write in the book, “the way an engineering team thinks about their work is as significant to the functioning of the system as the structure of a sorting algorithm. If we tried to look past all the people to find the algorithm, we’d miss a crucial part of how and why these systems come to work as they do” (7).\n\nSo, that idea is what motivates the rest of the book: If the cultural theorizing of engineers matters to how their algorithms function, then what’s in that cultural theorizing? The following chapters work through some of it, talking about how my interlocutors thought about listeners, genre, musical sound, their own influence on the world, and so on.\n\nTarleton Gillespie: Well, then I want to know what’s in the cultural theorizing of these engineers, around one concept in particular, the one you chose for the title of the book: “taste”. What do the engineers who serve up my music streams think taste is when you ask them, and what does it seem to mean to them when they implement it into their recommendation systems?\n\nNick Seaver: This is something I only really figured out as I was pulling together the last stages of the book. I had gone into the field with a pretty simple idea about what I was looking for: people building these systems to model taste must have some theory of taste, and that would influence what they built. Or maybe, the tools available to them would influence their theories of taste. So, for example, if you think that people like the music they like because of how it sounds, then it would make sense to build a recommender that relied on audio data; if you thought that people liked the music their friends like, then you might do something with a social network. But I never really found anything that straightforward. I asked everyone I interviewed, point blank, “Why do you think people like the music they like?” And no one really had an answer; usually, they just laughed and said something like “Who knows?”\n\nThere’s a bit about this in the book, where I realize that what’s happening isn’t really the building of a particular theory of taste into infrastructure, but an effort to produce what I describe as an open plan: a kind of infrastructure meant to facilitate growth and exploration, which tries to be rather agnostic about the reasons why a person might like what they like. But, as we’ve seen in other domains, efforts to be open always have their limits; they facilitate some actions and not others. And this openness ended up manifesting as a hugely omnivorous data collection apparatus: Who knows what signal might end up being useful? Might as well collect everything. The more open the plan, the wider the net.\n\nTarleton Gillespie: This open plan approach definitely resonates with other instances of data science and machine learning — visualizing the entire corpus of content or the entire collection of data points about user preferences as a vast, flat landscape to be wandered. But that doesn’t sound much like how taste works, which by definition implies discernment and evaluation, i.e. not everything, and it doesn’t sound much like recommendation, which generally is a this-not-that offer. I imagine they see themselves as building an open plan such that each listener, millions of listeners, can find a path through it that’s to their own taste. But still, that sure does downplay their agency, very much gets them out of the way. What is it that they are attempting to do with their recommender systems? Who are they imagining they’re doing it for?\n\nNick Seaver: There’s this tension at the heart of algorithmic recommendation: it’s predicated on the idea that you might like anything (certainly more than you realize right now), but that you won’t like everything. So recommender systems are always caught up in this paradoxical position of trying to help people “break out of their boxes” (as it’s often put) while also profiling them to figure out where they might want to go once they’re out.\n\nNow that’s a very sympathetic picture of what recommender systems and their developers are doing. Most critics would focus on the second part: recommender systems profile you, they box you in, they limit your view of that otherwise open cultural space. It’s not too hard to find arguments that these systems are about cultivating certain kinds of desire in users—to make a streaming music catalog more valuable by getting people to listen more (to more stuff, for a longer time). And that’s not wrong, but it’s only half of the story. A lot of the book is dedicated to describing how people working on these systems navigate that tension, between facilitating exploration and modeling preference.\n\nI think the “this-not-that” reading of recommendation makes a lot of sense in the present moment, where recommenders are really everywhere and can meaningfully shape the entirety of what you encounter on a given platform. But it’s easy to forget that not so long ago, algorithmic recommendation was this little side feature—a thing in the corner that was only ever going to be a supplement to whatever else a user was doing. In the early days of these systems, in the mid-1990s, they were quite explicitly aimed at people who were already enthusiastic about music, willing to mess with new technologies, and happy to fill out lots of ratings. But since then, music recommendation (like most other kinds of recommendation) has shifted to target less enthusiastic listeners, to encourage them to listen more. This has happened at the same time that recommender systems have started to envelop platforms, such that people can start to talk about “Facebook” or “Spotify” or “Netflix” as almost synonymous with their recommendation algorithms.\n\nOver the last decade or so, there’s been a major shift in the power of recommendations to really exclude stuff; we like to think of these systems as being widely influential, but (if that’s true) it’s only fairly recent. At the end of the book there’s a epilogue where I interview one of the major figures from the field, and this change comes up: I don’t think many people working on recommender technology were really prepared to succeed to the degree that they have.\n\nTarleton Gillespie: This idea of the open plan, this sense that recommendation was a curious add-on, both fit with a sense of modesty you note in the way these designers describe their role – often using pastoral metaphors, they characterize themselves as “park rangers,” “farmers,” “gardeners,” and occasionally “bushwackers… making this overgrown musical jungle navigable.” What do you think of this modesty? Do you think they are right to diminish their role, less powerful than public worries might suggest? Or do they need to tell themselves this, because they are embodying a powerful role in the current cultural landscape?\n\nNick Seaver: I think this is a really important question that we can’t entirely answer from an ethnographic study of this particular group. People often ask me about the consequences of these systems for music, listening, and culture more broadly; my first somewhat negative popular review of the book focused on precisely this issue and how it’s not addressed in there! But there’s a good reason for this: the kinds of cultural consequences people are worried about are big and broad and multifarious. We need many studies, in many different domains, to start to suss them out. I think a lot of people have an intuition that these systems are obviously influential, in obvious ways—but we shouldn’t assume that the goals of engineers translate neatly into broad cultural consequences, good or bad. We’re starting to see more empirical research on things like how musicians and record labels think about making music in a world full of recommender systems, how listeners think about all the designs on their attention, and the knock-on effects of widespread personalization. And the results are really mixed! In some cases, filter bubble-like effects don’t seem to happen; in other places, musicians try to adapt their style to “the algorithm,” but can only do so through mental models that may have very little to do with what’s going on under the hood.\n\nSo I don’t want to let my interlocutors in the book off the hook, nor do I want to assume that they are supremely powerful actors. Like everyone else, they occupy positions that enable and constrain them, their plans do not always work out, and while they certainly attempt to influence others, their influence is not guaranteed. That can sound like a cop-out answer, but I’ve long worried about a style of technology critique that artificially inflates its objects so as to increase its own importance. I think it’s a mistake to figure these people as powerful men behind the curtain. That kind of move does not help us understand our situation, and it takes us away from the boring-but-important empirical work we could be doing instead.\n\nMy own modest effort here is fairly constrained to documenting, as adequately as I can, how this particular group of people thought about their work at a particular moment in time. The chapter on all these gardening and farming metaphors, for instance, takes a rather contrarian angle in the discourse on data metaphors: instead of explaining how metaphors like these naturalize the work of engineers and convince a non-expert public that machine learning is all objective and organic, I try to figure out why people use these metaphors even among themselves, to try and make sense of what they’re doing. My takeaway is that pastoral metaphors usefully index a kind of bounded control, where the objects of one’s labor can be lively and surprising, despite the organizing role of the worker. This is less critical in a narrow sense, but I think it helps us to understand the appeal of these ways of thinking to their thinkers, which is part of the overall puzzle we’re living through now.\n\nI hope this approach I take throughout the book makes it useful to folks who want to make more grounded critiques of this industry, as well as to people working in this space who may want to step back and think about some of the deep assumptions that underlie their work. Whether or not we imagine these systems as super-influential, there is a lot of work to do.\n\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Community-Solidarity-and-Multilingualism-in-a-Transnational-Social-Movement-A-Critical-Sociolinguistic-Ethnography-of-Emmaus/GarridoSarda/p/book/9780367534530\n\nMaryam Amiri: The role of story-telling in your study seemed very interesting to me. What was the significance of the founding story in the transnational articulation of multiple localities and in creation of difference?\n\nMaria Rosa Garrido Sardà: Put simply, storytelling keeps the Emmaus transnational movement going. The well-known origins story narrates the first encounter between Abbé Pierre, a French parliamentarian who chose an alternative lifestyle, and Georges Legay, a released prisoner who had failed to commit suicide, which led to the creation of the first Emmaus community as a new reason to live. Their common goal with Lucie Coutaz (a third female founder that is often erased) was to provide shelter for homeless people and families and to campaign for housing rights in France. Today, Abbé Pierre (Henri Grouès, 1912-2007) is still a major icon in Francophone Europe as exemplified by an ambitious biopic that premiered at the Cannes Festival, two new biographies (Lunel 2023, Doudet 2022) and a 2024 campaign to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Abbé’s radio appeal for solidarity organised by Emmaus Switzerland.\n\nIn every community I have visited there were semiotic representations of Abbé Pierre as an index towards this origins story. In the book, I argue that the retelling and reenactment of the founding story across spaces and over time is the glue that holds the movement together. These common storytelling practices align the local communities with the broader transnational imaginary of unknown others. Well-established members retell the founding story to socialise newcomers and to perform one’s own story as companions who found new reasons to live in Emmaus. All in all, situated storytelling constructs a collective identity across linguistic and national borders at a particular sociohistorical juncture. Besides (re)creating sameness through intertextuality, the retelling of the origins story is also an act of differentation, relocalisation and change. In other words, these retellings are never mere repetitions because they are embedded in the lived experiences, interdiscursive histories and sociopolitical goals of each local community. During my fieldwork, the Emmaus UK motto was “a bed and a reason to get out of it” as an intertextual chain of finding new reasons to live in the founding story, but the London staff used it to justify voluntary work in the cooperative as neoliberal activation of passive (homeless) populations, who only get “a bed” in day shelters and “a reason to get out of bed” in Emmaus volunteering.\n\nMaryam Amiri: Can you tell us a bit about your intellectual trajectory and the motivation behind the research and writing of this book? What triggered your interest in the issue and where did you start? Also, how are your other books and research in dialogue with Community, Solidarity and Multilingualism in a Transnational Social Movement?\n\nMaria Rosa Garrido Sardà: I was trained in critical ethnographic sociolinguistics at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and I wrote my PhD thesis proposal during a research stay at the University of Chicago, where I learned more about North American linguistic anthropology. This research project grew organically out of my MA thesis about a residential project for homeless migrants that brought me in contact with the Emmaus transnational movement for the first time. In 2008, I was invited to have lunch with the community (which is, coincidentally, the opening of my book) and I couldn’t help but wonder what united people from different linguistic, cultural, religious and class backgrounds around that table. In addition, the community responsables (primus inter pares in a live-in community) lent me a 1955 black and white film about the origins of the movement in French. These triggered my interest in the shared imaginary and the multilingual articulation among local Emmaus communities located in various sociolinguistic, political and historical contexts. As preliminary fieldwork, I visited the first Emmaus community in the outskirts of Paris and I looked into the social movement. In Chicago, I later conceptualised this articulation through the lens of transnationalism and imagined communities.\n\nI initially decided to write a book because I felt frustrated about the space limitations in research articles that only presented slices of my sociolinguistic ethnography. Although any ethnography is necessarily partial and situated, the book format allowed me to tell the story moving from the historical origins, main foundational texts and ideological trends of the movement to the sociolinguistic account of the two focal communities in London and Barcelona and finally providing an outlook to the future. My interest in solidarity movements and the links with the humanitarian industry shaped my postdoctoral research on multilingualism and mobility of delegates in the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), headquartered in Geneva (Switzerland). At the moment, Miguel Pérez-Milans and I are working on an edited volume on the sociolinguistic (re)imaginations of the future in grassroots movements that picks up on the closing of my book on utopia as both an unreachable horizon and a motor for social change.\n\nMaryam Amiri: What was your methodology and research design for ethnographically investigating transnational communication? What was your critical lens? What challenges did you face and how did you manage to deal with them?\n\nMaria Rosa Garrido Sardà: This book is mainly based on a multi-sited ethnography of two local communities: a primary site in the Barcelona province (Catalonia) and a secondary site in the Greater London area (England). This was a year-long ethnography in the linguistic anthropological tradition during which I joined the communities as a participant-observer in activities including furniture/clothes collection and second-hand store work, housework, meetings with other organisations, internal assemblies, communal meals and celebrations. In terms of data, I wrote daily fieldnotes, audio recorded assemblies, collected textual material, took photographs, and interviewed over 30 people. Inspired by Monica Heller, I was interested in the role of language, discourse and narrative in the construction of social difference and social inequality and the material consequences for specific people and communities in the movement.\n\nThe challenges that have stuck with me were access negotiation and navigating research ethics with the local participants. Emmaus Barcelona had an assembly discussion to collectively decide if I could carry out my study, which they agreed to because the ethnographic methodology was close to their preference for first-hand experience (such as getting to know Emmaus during lunchtime shows). Meanwhile, access to Emmaus London involved identifying and interacting with various staff members who made a top-down decision. This translated into sometimes difficult bottom-up negotiations with companions (the term used in the movement to designate residents in a live-in community) in the different spaces, which entailed explaining my research goals and methods in plain language. Another major challenge in Barcelona was reconciling university contractual ethics involving individual procedures (notably signing consent forms) and a social system based on trust in the community, in which I was a friend of the house. In addition, assemblies posed a major challenge because it would have been extremely disruptive to obtain signed informed consent from over 20 people for every single recording. As a compromise, the community wrote a collective letter to authorise me to record every assembly, but I was still allowed to ask for oral permission to record before each assembly and all participants signed a single consent form valid for all assemblies.\n\nMaryam Amiri: In your work, you give us a historical overview of the Emmaus movement, how it developed, and how it spread across borders to then analyze the discursive and linguistic practices of two Emmaus communities in Barcelona and London. How do you think studying the history of such transnational social movements contributes to understanding their contemporary contexts and practices and the effects of those practices in creating or solving social inequalities?\n\nMaria Rosa Garrido Sardà: My longue durée ethnography, involving visits, interviews and occasional field observations over a decade, fuelled a longstanding interest in the history of the Emmaus movement. In 2019, I embarked on a historiographic project in the French Archives Nationales du Monde du Travail with a two-fold objective. Adopting a historicising lens allowed me to make sense of local forms of social action in my ethnography as constitutive of broader institutional, historical, sociopolitical and economic processes over time. This opens a window onto processes of social difference, for instance the categories and boundaries that were created in the movement, and ultimately, processes of social stratification in a center/periphery logic. First, I wanted to trace the situated production, translation and uptake of fundamental texts (for example, the Universal Manifesto of the Emmaus movement, 1969) in relation to major turning points since the movement’s foundation in 1949. This provided an illuminating account of the transnational expansion and internal diversification of the movement. For example, Simon’s “Les Chiffonniers d’Emmaüs” (1954), in which he narrates the lived experiences of early companions, was translated into 14 languages and it inspired multiple generations of activists in the early period, some of whom I met during fieldwork.\n\nThe second goal was to trace the antecedents, genesis and trajectories of the two focal communities, each representing a different ideological trend and historical period in the broader movement. Emmaus Barcelona was firmly located in a Progressive Catholic tradition in Catalonia and had strong links with Liberationist Christianity in Latin America. This faith tradition within Emmaus combined sociopolitical struggle, a collective lifestyle and an anti-capitalist (later alter-globalist) ethos. As an illustrative example, the Barcelona community welcomed undocumented people and campaigned for their rights in the city. Emmaus London was constituted as an English charity that largely erased the movement’s Catholic origins and the transnational founding story. Its mission was vested in the Protestant Work Ethic and sought to re-activate formerly homeless people for labour and social re-insertion. Contrary to Emmaus Barcelona, all companions needed to have legal status in the UK in accordance with charity regulations. As a result, the vast majority of companions were British and English-speaking at a time when many Eastern European people were sleeping rough in London.\n\nMaryam Amiri: Can you elaborate on the role of language ideologies and tensions of language in shaping the members’ participation and their negotiation of power relations? How did your findings challenge the expectations of multilingualism in social movements?\n\nMaria Rosa Garrido Sardà: In terms of power relations, it is important to understand the centrality of France as the cradle and international center of the Emmaus movement. As far as I know, this is one of the few social movements that relies on French as a primary lingua franca. Both communities in my ethnography were peripheral with respect to the symbolic center but they positioned themselves differently. Since the early 1990s, Emmaus UK has expanded into the second largest national federation (after France) and it mainly focuses on business expansion in Britain, which translated into Emmaus London’s tenuous links with France and the broader international movement. Emmaus Barcelona is the only community in Catalonia and it does not form part of a large federation, privileging a cross-border network of altermondialiste Liberationist Emmaus communities. This community has had a historical connection with France and Abbé Pierre since the local leader’s participation in work camps in the 1970s. Both communities backgrounded language and multilingualism through the use of English as a lingua franca in London and by not problematising a lack of shared language in favour of the welcome principle in Barcelona.\n\nThe discursive appropriations of the transnational Emmaus movement in the Barcelona and London sites will help us understand the different orientations towards communication with transnational members and towards multilingualism in their daily interaction. Emmaus London was characterised by an English-speaking norm that was implicit for new companions for the sake of social integration but was made explicit for three French interns during my fieldwork. Most of the community’s connections were with London-based charities and Emmaus groups in the UK. Their infrequent contact with the transnational movement in France relied on ad-hoc French translators. In this sociolinguistic regime, the few English-speaking companions who wanted to visit other communities in Europe looked for what they considered English-friendly ones in the Netherlands or Germany. On the other hand, Emmaus Barcelona was a Catalan-Spanish bilingual community and the welcome of transnational migrants mobilised some members’ French and English resources. As for transnational communication with other Emmaus activists, Emmaus Barcelona members valued shared communitarian lifestyle and willingness to communicate over language convergence. They would mix Romance languages and resort to their knowledge of Spanish and for some, French to communicate across borders.\n\nTo go back to your question about the unexpected findings on multilingualism, this study warns us against assuming a homogeneous dominance of English as a lingua franca in social movements. Contrary to my initial expectations, French remains the main lingua franca in the movement despite the official use of English and Spanish in Emmaus International and in certain networks of the movement. For this research project, I had to improve my French competences to read the literature on Emmaus, to access the archives and to interview some key players. Without it, I don’t think I would have been able to write this book. Another finding that I would like to further explore in the future is whether altermondialiste movements may offer different linguistic constellations and linguistic eclecticism to communicate across borders as I have documented in the Barcelona group’s networks.\n\nhttps://beekeepingintheendtimes.com/Home\n\nMira Guth: In the book, you write beautifully about the power of storytelling to both gather knowledge and incite action—from ethnographic stories of changing honeybee ecologies to Islamic eschatological tales that teach listeners how to live well in the face of imminent end times. Thinking about the role of stories in your book as well as your documentary—where hope and apocalypse are not mutually exclusive—what can storytelling offer us in the age of climate change?\n\nLarisa Jašarević: Thank you, Mira, for speaking kindly of my work and for raising the question on which this book pivots. Ethnography was always about storytelling, wasn’t it? Just think back to Malinowski, Mead, or Evans-Pritchard; for all the issues that we may have with the way anthropological knowledge fit snugly with colonial projects and imperialist epistemologies, those classic monographs still yield insights and carry a charge when we re-read them nowadays, precisely because of the stories they tell. Once anthropology became more honest about and more comfortable with the fact that ours is the science of “writing culture” and ever since critical studies of modern science, such as Isabel Stenger’s Inventing Modern Science or much of Bruno Latour’s undoing of fact/fiction, storytelling has become available to us not just as a colorful way of conveying the lore of others but as a method of producing knowledge. In other words, storytelling does not just add frills but is a method of thinking through puzzles, a preferred way of teaching and sharing. Anna Tsing’s work—and, my word, what a storyteller she is!—ever since the Realm of the Diamond Queen, and for me, Friction is the insider’s guide to telling stories anthropologically, to theorizing through storytelling.\n\nWith the global environmental and climate crisis, storytelling has become all the rage among concerned scholars across the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Donna Haraway’s incitement that ‘we must tell stories” and that “stories must change” became chants at the writing riots within eco-minded scholarship that narrates our catastrophic times. Storytelling is recommended to grab attention, to compel care and action and, importantly, to recast the lots and the stakes: what in the world could we be feeling and doing if we no longer took the world we knew for granted? We are living in the ruins of our late-modern certainties. A turn to storytelling has become a way to salvage good things from our scholarly enterprise, so that robust thinking can go on as climate change frays the biosphere and overheats our undergrounds.\n\nThis book and the film I co-directed with my sister, Azra Jasarevic, draw inspiration from Islamic cosmology, metaphysics, and eschatology as well as from Bosnian Muslim lore. Now, if I started from the flat statement that as a revealed, monotheistic, Abrahamic tradition Islam has been seldom perused for its ecological and analytical insights, I’d be making an argument that is sound, provocative, but not very inviting. Let me tell you a story of two angels, instead. If you lend me an ear, you’ll hear stuff about human companion species, eco-eschatology, about near synonyms and rough translations of apocalypse, as well as about God and revelation that you may not have imagined belonging in the stiff drawer that we labeled religion and stuffed full of mothballs. Angels, it turns out, have much to do with climate change, if we broach that problem from some different grounds. The tall task has never just been to tell stories, but to earn a listening. The challenge for the storytellers is to tap into and hone the arts of listening; this is what local Sufis have taught me. Most of all, storytelling can strike a tone with listeners outside academia. I’m striving for that.\n\nMira Guth: By foregrounding the ecological sensibilities and metaphysical insights of Islamic thought and practice, your book makes a key contribution to the field of multispecies ethnography—among many other realms of social thought—that have often avoided thinking seriously with monotheistic religion. What kinds of doors for scholarship do you see this intervention opening?\n\nLarisa Jašarević: You said it. My book is an invitation to venture beyond multispecies relations to think seriously through the relationships between plants, human, animals, elements and God—the nonhuman that modern secular social thought is most uncomfortable with. Likewise, to entertain the idea of the cosmos that includes angels, jinn, and, indeed, the devil. Very few sources in the budding, bold scholarship on the pluriverse, cosmologies, alien and Amerindian ontologies, human-animal relations, new vitalisms and so forth, deal with revealed religion except in passing, often off-handedly if not outright dismissively. Ontologies are welcome but metaphysics (which ontologies presume, by default) are avoided. Speculation is now cool but the mere mention of Revelation comes off as deeply inconveniencing and unconvincing. Indigenous cosmologies and science-fiction are mined for the perspectives that estrange or reenchant our ties with the planet in peril but the monotheistic, Abrahamic religions are presumed to be essentially synonyms with the western anthropocentricsm at the heart of global resourcist economy. What is more, Islam is often overlooked or lumped among the Abrahamic traditions, as presumingly not much different than Christianity or Judaism. In short, right at the heart of the most conceptually expansive surge there is a closure, a hard line drawn around the revealed tradition. My writing is tapping a finger there; scholars and writers better than I will, hopefully, take a second look, find cracks in the wall, start taking it down. Repurpose the bricks to lay down a path through the thickets and gulistans our gardens and campuses may become when we stop mowing our comfort zones. Much of the eco-minded writing, if not all of it, is about nurturing hope. There’s no shortage of good advice on why we should keep hope on a battered planet. What we’re missing is faith, now that we doubt Progress, development, disenchantment, the greenness of green technologies, the politics of climate action, and so on. Mind you, the question of faith, monotheistic or otherwise, is always a question of faith in the world teeming with sacred propositions at odds with each other. What grounds our hopes? What makes them possible and viable? We’re back to metaphysical questions.\n\nMira Guth: It strikes me that you initially had other plans for your research before a large storm and rainy summer hit Bosnia at the beginning of your fieldwork—with devastating implications for bees and their keepers. How did you pivot your focus? How can all contemporary anthropologists stay open and attuned to the strained multispecies worlds, inevitably touched by climate change, that they and their interlocutors must now inhabit?\n\nLarisa Jašarević: Mira, I appreciate this question so much. It’s the key question that I can only expand upon here. Initially, I intended to write about bees but not about climate change until its ecological local effects were forced upon me by a catastrophic storm and by the weird weather that bothered bees and plants and worried beekeepers long after the storm was nearly forgotten. Initially, I didn’t think I could study climate change, but over the years I’ve been rethinking the ways in which we could be attending to it. Climate change has been largely made into a technical issue that is intimidating to anyone who’s not conversant with climate science, climate biology, technologies and narratives of climate future projections, and such. Anthropologists have been cornered into studying the issue of climate change with terms such as vulnerability, resilience, or sustainability that are themselves technical and policy terms—and as such, worth engaging, indeed—but also rather narrow and uninspiring. On the contrary, there is so much that social sciences and humanities could do to step in and help us articulate questions, hear out concerns that various parties are already raising in non-technical terms. Let us find ways to discern the myriad, oblique, disseminated ways in which strange and extreme weather, deranged seasons, elemental alterations, species mismatches, bodily and sensuous registers of the unraveling atmosphere—in short, the rattle bag that is climate change—comes upon and by-and-by upturns all domains of social life. Our terms are becoming archaic (“a nice day,” “spring fashion”); our bodily experience is already archiving records of the former planet. The almanac of late modern and multispecies habits is being rewritten. That is not a technical issue. Biologists know this for a fact: idiosyncratic responses across species will be multiplying. The same goes for all species of knowledge and practice, for all are dependent on the climate in one way or another. So, yes, how do we study it?\n\nMira Guth: In the book you mention your own practice of keeping bees. How has this experience shaped your research, relationship, and understanding of beekeeping in the end times?\n\nLarisa Jašarević: Caring for the honeybees made it real for me; the whole of it, the end times, you know? But just as important has been the fact that I live by the honeybees, on a landslide-crumpled, precious heirloom of a piece of land. And that the apiary where I live and write is in Bosnia, the country where genocidal war shaped the landscape and inadvertently fostered ample new honey flow opportunities. I write from the place where, nowadays, extractivist, global ventures are quickly showing just how the corporate rush and grab to transition to green energy is, literally, colonizing air, water, and soil in the boondocks. And there’s been talk of new violence; the country has been on the edge ever since the war ended. At the same time, our mountaintop is a heaven for insects, birds, and plants. I keep seeing species that are new to me. Jasmine bushes are abloom. It’s the time of the year when owls are hooking up. The very air is hoarse with strigiform longing. The smaller birds must be on guard because this sort of courting between raptors is sealed by offerings of flesh. The mixed-up world we live in, here at my doorstep, jamal & jalal, lovers and raptors, all of us, caught in hail storms and jasmine perfume. Right now, it’s the swarming season for the honeybees. We’ve been having a swarm a day. Just yesterday, the strangest thing happened. A great swarm caught high up in a plum tree. Some fifty thousand bees, at least! Then it started separating across two, then three branches—bees literally walked back and forth, undecided. Twice I tried catching them in a swarm bag, standing up in the tree, and twice I failed. “I give up,” I swore loudly. Just as I turn on my heels, a cluster of bees plummeted to the grass, just like that, and instead of dispersing, stayed huddled on the ground, bee bodies pressed to each other, sticking tenaciously, wings folded back. What’s happening? I took a step closer and…. You can imagine the rest, dear Mira, this had been too long. Adhan from the local mosque was announcing the midday prayer. Putting things into perspective, and summoning me to presence.\n\nhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/going-tactile-9780197778029\n\nBob Offer-Westort: Going Tactile is such an exciting book: It’s a unique read in a number of ways, many of which are interrelated. In the book you walk us through a history of the development of Protactile—a DeafBlind language and way of being that’s come about in Seattle over the past couple decades. Very few linguistic anthropologists get to work with language emergence in this way, or to deal with language in a tactile modality. I wonder if you might talk a little bit about that juncture in the term Protactile itself, with all the different things it denotes: a perspective on engaging environmental affordances, a form of personhood, a language, a social movement. What it is that’s anterior to Protactility temporally, phenomenologically, in terms of personhood, in terms of code?\n\nTerra Edwards: That’s easy, Bob! Anything outside of contact space.\n\n“Contact space” is a theoretical construct that first appeared in print in a 2018 article called, “PT Principles” (PT = protactile). The article was written by two DeafBlind intellectuals, teachers, and political leaders, aj granda and Jelica Nuccio. It contains a unified theory of living and communicating the protactile way, including 7 principles, several sub-principles, and explicit statements regarding the relationship between them. The first principle, from which all others follow is, “any time space is used, make sure it is contact space, not air space.” (p. 4). At first, I thought “contact space” was like “articulatory space” in linguistics—the space within which linguistic signs are articulated. And it is that. But it’s also what protactile people live in. The way I’ve come to think about it is that, whether it is at the level of linguistic structure or something much larger, contact space is the thing that sets the parameters of intelligibility in protactile settings. The best way I can explain my understanding of contact space is to tell you about some recent experiences in it (both of which are discussed in the book).\n\nLast summer, I was visiting a protactile training center run by a DeafBlind woman I call Adrijana. I hadn’t been there in a while and the last time I tried to keep up with a protactile conversation, I was having difficulty with basic things like what time we would meet back up for lunch, what our schedule would be for the week, and who we were talking about. That’s why I went to the training center. I wanted to get caught up on new vocabulary. When I got there, I asked Adrijana to teach me some new words. She told me to put on a blindfold. That was a pattern. People would ask, “How do you say…” and she would tell them to pay attention to their environment. When Adrijana first told me to put on a blindfold, I wasn’t sure how to behave. I took hesitant steps around the house with my arms extended straight out in front of me. Adrijana pushed my arms down and said, “Zombie”. She told me that my feet would tell me when to extend an arm. I knew it was customary to take your shoes off in protactile settings, but I hadn’t fully grasped what that affords. Adrijana showed me that my feet (separated from the environment only by my thin socks), pick up all kinds of information. Standing in the kitchen on the smooth cool floor, she turned my hand so my palm was facing down. The hand stood for (represented) my foot. From underneath, she slid her palm slowly past mine, creating a sensation that resembled the feeling of my foot on the kitchen floor. Then we moved into the living room and this time she mimicked the feeling of carpet on my down-turned palm by making a scratching motion with her fingertips. Crossing over the threshold from the kitchen to the living room, she guided my attention to where the two textures met underfoot and showed me how it gave us the clue we needed to reach out our hands. Together, we followed the smooth edges of the kitchen counter to the dry wooden door frame, to the puffy warm couch, and we sat down. Once seated, she explained that now, we were in “contact space”. Me walking around as if there was nothing meaningful beneath our feet was anterior to Protactile, in part because the environment was not legible to me and to Adrijana in ways that corresponded, and in part because I was not legible in that environment as a person (I could only be a zombie), and the two are related. Contact space sets the parameters of intelligibility.\n\nBob Offer-Westort: One of the really striking things in reading this book is the contrast between experiential loss (or collapse) and experiential discovery in your accounts of people’s growing blindness and their coming into Protactile ways of being in the world. As we follow people undergoing these shifts, we find ourselves thinking through fragments of experience that are rare in ethnographies: The accessibility or inaccessibility of moisture on a window, what can be smelled from a dog’s mouth, the feeling of the floor through one’s socks… Like many of the people in this book, you too are learning how to be Protactile. In our fieldwork, many of us have to learn more directed modes of attunement, but in your case—as a sighted, hearing person—you were dealing with actually having different sensory access to the environment from your interlocutors. What is this kind of fieldwork like?\n\nTerra Edwards: It wasn’t foregrounded in this book, but I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about sensory access, and despite its utility, I’ve come to the conclusion that the idea falls off right where the world starts. I just published an article in Anthropological Theory called The Medium of Intersubjectivity. The main question that article addresses is: “What are we in when we’re together?” If you think about it as sensory access, then maybe we’re feeling rather than seeing, or touching rather than looking, but you can’t be in that. Over the years, I have been taught by protactile people not just to feel, but to work with others toward an understanding of how the environment speaks to us, moment to moment. The senses are part of that, I guess, but the more important thing is listening for signs that tell you how to act and to act in ways that count as signs to others. What you realize when you do that is that there is a whole world full of chatter telling you where you can go and what you can do. When you start cashing in on that, one thing leads to another, like a day in your week, or an hour in your day. To me, that’s different from sensory access, and it’s an open question how different it is from what other anthropologists do.\n\nBob Offer-Westort: The major theoretical touchstones in this book seem to me to be the work of theory-making undertaken by Protactile leaders on the one hand, and Paul Kockelman’s residential reading of Heidegger’s Being and Time on the other. Could you tell us a little bit about how these theoretical efforts come together in the book and your thinking?\n\nTerra Edwards: Going Tactile is part of a larger project about the existential and environmental foundations of language emergence. This book focuses on the existential and my second book (which I plan to co-author with Diane Brentari) will focus on the environmental foundations. Both very much center on semiotics in a broad sense, but you can’t get at the existential without re-thinking readings of Peirce that have become canonical in our field. Paul has offered us that—a re-thinking of Peirce via Heidegger that makes a very useful distinction between residing in the world and representing the world, and breaks the former down into a tractable set of interrelated concepts that can actually be removed from the philosophy and applied, anthropologically, at the level of interaction and language-use. In the introduction to Going Tactile, for example, I draw on this framework to understand a series of events that unfolded one afternoon when I was with Adrijana and Sam, who is hearing and sighted. I wrote the following in my fieldnotes afterwards:\n\nA couple of days ago, we were all at Adrijana’s house and Sam said, “There are beautiful white flowers all over your back yard.” And Adrijana said, “They’re weeds”. And Sam said, “Come on.”, and the three of us walked together to the back yard. We padded across the porch, which was hot, down the steps, and into the dry, cool grass. The yard was filled with white flowers. Sam and Adrijana pulled one of the flowers out of the ground, and it came with a whole complicated root system. Adrijana felt the roots and said “Weed.” Sam directed Adrijana’s attention to the flower—the part that had been visible to her from above. The flower was silky soft and cone-shaped. Inside, there was a delicate, yellow stamen. Adrijana felt the flower. Then she cupped Sam’s jaw loosely in her palms, fingers angled out, forming a cone. She tilted the cone, with Sam’s head inside, toward the sun, and said as if she were the flower, “I’m innocent.”\n\nAdrijana was arguing that our eyes deceived us. The flowers looked innocent, but their roots were ruining her lawn. In expressing her argument this way, she was inviting us into a way of interpreting the environment, which was grounded in a protactile way of being.\n\nIf I cupped your jaw in my palms right now, Bob, and I turned your face slowly toward the hot afternoon sun, you would probablyfeel exactly like a disingenuous flower. If I’m right, and you did, then more has transpired than just talking about a flower. That interaction leads us into an environment where beautiful white flowers don’t fool anyone. This is where being in the world and representing the world come together, and that, to me, is at the heart of protactile theory. The further you get into “contact space”, the more likely you are to talk about the world in ways that correspond across those living in (and visiting) contact space. A self-reinforcing loop starts to form. The people I spend most of my time with in the field are big fans of Paul’s work. In fact, one of them texted me a while back and told me that they were starting a club called “KFC”. What does that stand for? “Kockelman Fan Club”. The reason they like his work, I think, is that it introduces a vocabulary that articulates to, elaborates, challenges, and otherwise interacts with their own conceptual vocabularies in productive ways. I’m part of that conversation and this book is a contribution to it.\n\nBob Offer-Westort: There’s decidedly a politics to the book: You’ve designed it without diagrams, tables, or footnotes to avoid creating a description of DeafBlind worlds for which an interpreter would need to provide access to DeafBlind readers. You also follow DeafBlind political activism in state government. But perhaps the most central political thread through the book is a politics of environment situated at the limits of language: We see this very clearly in your sixth chapter, on the design of DeafBlind space at Gallaudet University, but I think it’s present in everyday approaches to environment throughout. I would love to read more about how you’re thinking about this.\n\nTerra Edwards: Why do we represent the world? One reason is to obtain resources through established social and political processes. We stake a claim, make our case, and so-on. The recent history of the Seattle DeafBlind community highlights the fact that when we engage in those processes, we tend to reproduce or reinforce ways of being in the world that are taken for granted by those in power. It feels a little like a trap: You have to be what you are to them in order to get what they have. The protactile movement broke out of that by uncovering environments that were not controlled by sighted people or their norms. That created a reprieve, where new environments could be discovered. Claims about the world, what was true, what was right, and what was needed emerged from those efforts, not the other way around. But once those environments were discovered, they had to be protected, defended, and justified. There is a politics that emerges out of situations like that, which are not aimed at getting what they have, but at protecting what is, and always has been, yours. Throughout the book, I am trying to trace a form of politics that doesn’t try to replace one construct with another, change standards that cannot be conformed to, or enter spaces that were designed to exclude, but instead, aims to create, maintain, and protect the possibility of existence. Given that goal, my attention was drawn away from explicit mentions of language as such, talk about identity, or other things that often become targets of political discourse, and toward things that might seem to fall outside of the realm of politics, like how one person directs another from the kitchen to the living room, or debates about whether a plant is a flower or a weed. If I was going to sum it up, I would say that the environment is what we exist in and what we move through. When it breaks down, we sometimes struggle to exist, and there are forms of politics that operate within that struggle that we, as anthropologists, are well equipped to study.\n\nBob Offer-Westort: I would guess that one of the things that’s exciting about studying an emerging language is that things are in comparatively rapid flux. This book is the product in part of your dissertation fieldwork as well as some post-dissertation work at Gallaudet. It’s now been a few years since the latest fieldwork in this book. What is changing now?\n\nTerra Edwards: You’re going to have to read my second book to get an answer to this question, Bob.\n\nBob Offer-Westort: The semiotic perspective that you employ in this book opens up questions that aren’t yet standard fare in linguistic anthropology. I don’t want to ask for a programmatic statement or a prescription, but I’d love to read your thoughts about how linguistic anthropology and other disciplines might take up this mode of engaging semiosis more broadly. What is the work or mode of work that you’d really like to see?\n\nTerra: Edwards: I’m not sure I have an idea of what I’d like to see (I love being surprised), but I do think there are some important conversations to be had about the limits of language. When DeafBlind people in Seattle were becoming blind, the visual world they once knew collapsed. Historically speaking, the first collective response to that problem was to obtain resources from the state to pay for sighted interpreters who were trained to substitute descriptions of the world for the world. Thinking carefully about those attempts, I learned that there is a limit to what language can do when the world is falling apart. Broadly speaking, in moments of crisis, rupture, and collapse, one might find that talk about the world is no longer a reliable way of gaining access to, intervening in, or otherwise affecting change in the world. For example, if you were one of the people who spent most of your time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, you may have felt at some point that digital representations of social life were exhausting their capacity to substitute for social life. That is what I talk about in Going Tactile as a “sign of collapse.” You can’t perceive collapse directly, so you look for signs. Maybe you realize one day that statements are no longer treated as true or false, or maybe arguments for rights and resources carry no weight. Maybe your attempts to spin things only drive you deeper into the problems you’re trying to escape. Maybe you realize that no one out there is coming to help, so there really is nothing more to say. Problems like these are all rooted in a terminal imbalance between residence and representation. Unfortunately, I think this issue will become ubiquitous in the years to come, and it would be well worth our time as linguistic anthropologists to find ways of thinking about it.\n\nhttps://www.dukeupress.edu/composing-violence\n\nDrew Kerr: On one reading, you’ve offered a fresh take on the exclusionary Hindu nationalist project of perpetual crisis re/creating an internal enemy in India, which we might highlight a special animation to this crisis in 1992 with the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, cemented as a model in the 2002 events of the Gujarat pogrom in your book, and now, as of January 22, 2024, in a way consecrated with the building of the Ram Mandir over the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid. You challenge us to not take these events — and major events like them across the globe — as finished and to not take them as simply destructive. Simultaneously, your work broadly challenges the idea and hope of witnessing in spaces of violence. I’m curious if you could explain the tensions you knead out between destruction and composure, and how violence forces us to rethink that relationship?\n\nMoyukh Chatterjee: Thanks, Drew, for your question, which goes to the heart of the book and its ambition. The mise-en-scene of political violence, especially what is called communal violence and riots in South Asia, may be quite familiar to many readers and scholars – burned shops, cycles, cars, dead bodies, police marches. This violence is often categorized as religious violence and ethnic conflict, which is not very helpful at all since it assumes the violence can then be somehow sequestered within the boundaries of something called Hinduism and Islam which exists outside the secular apparatus of the courts, police, law, and elections.\n\nBut the dead bodies on the streets and the burned down shops and houses only show the destructive force of collective violence on lives and spaces. And as you mentioned, what do we do with an explicitly exclusionary project that also aims to create new forms of belonging and inclusion? What do we do when riots and pogroms are only act one, stage one, like the case of Gujarat 2002, when anti-Muslim pogroms became the launchpad for a new form of public, muscular Hinduism, a new form of majoritarian governance, and a new kind of wounded and triumphant Hindu self. In such contexts, I have suggested that composition rather than exposure may be more helpful. Since composition moves away from the framing of political violence as an event that is supposedly finished or as always ensconced within the framework of victim/perpetrator or even as something that is always already under erasure. In this way, my book builds on the work of a range of political anthropologists – Veena Das, Jonathan Spencer, Daniel Hoffman, Val Daniel, Pradeep Jeganathan – to name just a few who come to mind, who have explored this tension between the destructive and the productive in tracking the afterlives of political violence in different contexts.\n\nIn other words, composition is the answer to the problem of framing an object that does not end with the horror and brutality of subjection and humiliation, (and here I am thinking of the work of Saidiya Hartman and Fred Moten writing about racism) but continues to animate new spaces (courtroom and police station) and new forms of rule. (new laws or the use of old laws for new purposes). In a related but also different way, this helps us see the question of violence anew, not within the binary of violence/peace as if violence against minorities is an aberration or breakdown of democracy, but ask what kind of social and political relationships sublimate, organize, transform, and interrupt violence against minorities within liberal democracies.\n\nDrew Kerr: A few different types of dialectics — for example, norm and ideology, erasure and exposure, witness and victim, majority and minority — come into being through violences that ultimately give flesh to the categories and roles of Hindu and Muslim. You clearly show us, though, none of these categories are ever fully self-evident or stable in concept for the researcher or in practice for the residents in 2002 and present-day Gujarat. I find this incredibly hopeful (thank you!) to think, write, and live beyond false and fixed dichotomies on one hand, as well as quite insidious, which, I think, plays a larger compositional role in the book and the events described. Can you tell us more about the logics of such an “impossible dialectic” (Agamben 2000) and how they showed up in, and comprised, your research?\n\nMoyukh Chatterjee: Because I was working with paralegals and human rights activists, the dialectics you mention above, especially binaries like Hindu/Muslim, victim/perpetrator, acquittal/conviction framed my fieldwork (in almost overwhelming way) and it was a major challenge for me to not be fully absorbed or determined by them. Put another way, it seemed to me that the project of Hindu supremacy aimed to create an environment, an ethos, a background, where what you call false dichotomies appear self-evident, even experiential. So, I remember one Muslim witness telling me outside the courtroom that it was foolish to expect justice from the courts because they were Hindus. So beyond the breakdown of the law, the courts were doing something else, they were joining the wider political and social climate in Gujarat to declare to Muslims that they were outsiders, eternal outsiders.\n\nAnother example. During the pogrom in Gujarat, my interlocutors told me, it was a time when it did not matter what kind of Muslim you were – rich or poor, Shia or Sunni, apartment resident or slum dweller, judge or beggar – you were reduced to being a Muslim, and all the richness of other categories or all the differences of caste, language, sect, and region that mark the heterogeneity of Hindu/Muslim falls away. I think your question raises the larger context of social pluralism which is the norm (rather than the dichotomies) in India.\n\nSpeaking of binaries, the binary between impunity/rule of law and law/illegal also melts away when you observe the performance of trials and justice. So one day in Ahmedabad, almost a decade after the pogrom, you (Muslim witness) find yourself in front of the judge, and your neighbor is an accused, and you have to identify him as such, but the informal setting of the courtroom, or more specifically the lower courts in India, means that the accused can approach you, often in front of the NGO workers and paralegals, and ask you to forget the case, or reconcile, or otherwise intimidate you. Anthropology can reveal in such moments the human rights and statist fantasy of legal punishment, a fantasy often shared by activists, that one can move outside the social into a sanitized world of the legal.\n\nDrew Kerr: Semiotics or signs don’t play an explicit role in the argument of the book; however, you do draw on the language of meaning-making, composing, and producing what is rendered as legible, licit, and legitimate (Das 1995) — what I might frame in one word as significant. On my read, I find the work your argument is doing to be very beneficial for also thinking through regimes of language, the entanglement of social forces and speech acts, and the interplay between political ideologies and human capacities of sign-use. I’d love to hear more about your choices, then, in composing the book’s theoretical arc, as well as composing yourself methodologically during your research.\n\nMoyukh Chatterjee: An attention to semiotics, signs, and what you can call significance has been an integral part of my training in literature and anthropology. As a student of English literature in Delhi, I read Barthes and later in graduate school in Emory, I gravitated towards a group (or should I call them a cult?) of scholars and students who were very influenced by Deconstruction. But as an anthropologist, I felt uneasy dressing up my fieldwork in the language of deconstruction; it would mean that my fieldwork or stories would be to prove/disprove theoretical tendencies found within canonical texts by Foucault/Derrida or someone else. Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed with the readings that were offered in those classes – readings that deconstructed texts and performed incredible acts of interpretation!\n\nSo while composing the theoretical arc of the book, I thought maybe it will be a good idea to take some of the most familiar objects that frame political violence – witness, archive, trial, the unspeakable – and recast them, or attempt to recast them. To be frank, I am not sure I succeeded in doing all this in one book. And it was easier to show the limits of exposure than to compose violence. In terms of composition, I build on the literature on critique and post-critique. Composition builds on the limits of critique identified by literary scholars, for whom it is primarily a way of reading texts, which in my case becomes a way of reading violence.\n\nAnd I use it in terms of assembling a heterogeneous set of actors and affects, indebted to Latour’s concept of compositionism as well.\n\nAnd the question of language is quite an important part of what I have in mind with composition. And of course, there is a long tradition of attention to language in studies of violence. Unlike exposure which is perhaps indifferent to the object, and assumes that the language of exposure per se is not important (after all it is exposure that is the point) I think composition puts the question of significance at the center; it is, to paraphrase the novelist Coetzee, to wrest control from regimes of significance connected to the state/major. At the same time, I think the question of what lies beyond language, or semiotic regimes is also important; the affective charge of far-right Hindu supremacy and its performativity is a key aspect of its success. For instance, on encountering a violent image or procession, a compositional approach will ask, what are the publics formed by such images and rituals, how do actors insert themselves into its circulation and proliferation, and in that sense, make it political. I find these questions are difficult to ask within the exposure model.\n\nDrew Kerr: Legal documents, on the other hand, do play a central role in Composing Violence and the lives of your interlocutors. Nusrat Chowdhury (2019) in Bangladesh, Akhil Gupta (2012) in North India, and Matthew Hull (2008) in Pakistan have similarly shown how other types of official documents take on lives well beyond what we might evaluate as bureaucratic failures or democratic inefficiencies, demonstrating how documents themselves become affectively charged in particular milieux. You join this conversation with a special emphasis on the human actors involved in and with the document-type of the First Information Report (FIR). Ostensibly a legal and bureaucratic tool promising legibility and due legal process, the FIR, you illustrate, actually accomplishes something quite different. Can you help us understand the FIR as a medium – in the sense of something that “makes society imaginable and intelligible to itself”(Mazzarella 2004) – and the media ecology within which it circulates?\n\nMoyukh Chatterjee: Your question takes me back to graduate school. At the time I was writing my dissertation, some of these exciting new books had come out, and I remember that I was excited to witness the documents/paperwork turn in anthropology; in fact I almost made it the heart of the dissertation, but my advisor helped me to see the larger picture. In line with my interest in language and archives (which was also because of Subaltern Studies), I gravitated towards the power of police acts of interpretation and reporting. I was excited to find that police reports break out of context (what Derrida called iterability and Veena Das has a wonderful essay that uses this idea called the Signature of the State) and circulate in newspaper reports as public information. In fact, this discovery made me realize the extremely limited vocabulary used to describe religious violence in India and its genre-like quality that allowed violence to work like myth. This goes back to your question about the role of the FIR in making certain forms of violence against minorities intelligible as religious fervor and not state-sanctioned pogroms. David Nugent, a wonderful anthropologist of the state and also a member of my dissertation committee, would ask me pointedly, “why are the police recording the violence in the first place?” And as I describe in the book, even the blank FIRs in the archive, the blankness does political work by creating a certain time-space of violence. Overall I was struck by how a dry, technical document like the police’s first information report becomes the key ingredient of newspaper reports (and this must be based on relationships between crime reporters and police officers) that allow what Gyan Pandey has called the colonial master narrative of the communal riot to circulate as what is labeled news. And here, rather than expose the falsity and bias of the FIR (important work accomplished by activists and scholars soon after the violence) I got interested in its power to inscribe a wounded majority and a treacherous minority. In this sense, legal documents get charged by Hindu nationalist politics and are also constitutive of a milieu that produces the Muslim as outsider, communal, and destructive of the national community.\n\nDrew Kerr: Where would you locate this book in relation to the category of the minor you develop throughout your argument? I’m curious for whatever that question might spark for you, but I’m particularly imagining a capacious archive — and the idea of the archive — that houses media about and of violences rendered as communal and religiously divisive in India.\n\nMoyukh Chatterjee: This is such a wonderful question. I wish I could have developed the idea of the minor more expansively in my book. The minor and the minority as a concept, as you know, belongs to a long history, and I have learned from and continue to learn from the work of Talal Asad, Amir Mufti, Qadri Ismail, Ajay Skaria, Gyan Pandey, Faisal Devji, Chulani Kodikara to name only a few people who come to mind. As a concept I wanted to give a sense of the making of the minor and the minority, not simply as numerical categories, but as what does not circulate as the norm or model; that which interrupts the major or can unravel the major; and finally as a binary that is framed and re-framed within the institutional apparatuses and technologies of democracy., including the courtroom and police archive. As David Scott has argued, democracy seems to lock us into thinking that there is only the possibility of minority rule or majority rule, and if the minority position is a position without sovereignty, then part of the fantasy of right-wing movements like Hindu nationalism is to create a permanent majority and minority within a democracy. This has been framed in an earlier classical literature, as “the tyranny of the majority” (Tocqueville). But in terms of my ethnography, I have tried to work out a minor reading of violence, which is not a search for what is hidden or repressed, but what is on the surface of documents, technologies, and practices (like repetition and aggregation) and helps us understand the making of the major, and its artifice. In the book, it takes the form of the minor event, the minor characters who are often overlooked in the mise-en-scene of violence.\n\nYour idea of a capacious archive to document and tell this story of violence is really wonderful. I think it would take the idea of composition seriously to imagine such an archive outside the limits of conventional archival thinking. By which I mean non-narrative and non-chronological ways of representing anti-minority violence or what has been called religious violence. I have been very influenced by artistic work on violence, and perhaps, composition is my way of bringing some of that sensibility into scholarly work. In my fieldsite, I have been speaking to artists and curators, more recently, and thinking with them, this question of the archive. Would it be to map the soundscapes and visual field of this violence or to move away from the archive altogether, and think about how the minor – for instance Muslims and Dalits and Tribals – imagine a life inside and outside Hindu supremacy? When I was growing up in Delhi, this work was done by an organization called SAHMAT. They would create such counter-archives and use art to counter communalism and I think it would be great to reimagine a similar project in our times. Perhaps I will be lucky enough to be part of a project like that in the future.\n\nThank you so much, Drew, for your questions and patience throughout. I really enjoyed our conversation.\n\nReferences\n\nGiorgio Agamben. 2000. The Remnants of Auschwitz. (New York: Zone Books).\n\nNusrat Sabina Chowdhury. 2019.

You also want to tackle causality, and especially media effects. You argue that anthropologists eschew this question because it seems too linear. To that end you formulate a plural paradigm whereby one can identify multiple causes for a particular effect. How does a scholar identify the relevant interactions among multiple causes? In other words, how does one know that it is the combination of a particular set of, say, events, texts, voices, and experiences that co-produces worlds? And how can lurking from afar allow us to study these causal constellations?\n\nJohn Postill: When Routledge asked me to write a media/digital anthropology book I faced a dilemma, as I had two very different ideas in mind. The first idea was a book about the social effects of media practices based on a previous essay I had written. The second was a study of the online culture wars in the Anglosphere, more precisely of colourful anti-woke figures like Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, and Tucker Carlson. A friend of mine, the digital culture scholar Edgar Gómez Cruz, suggested I combine the two ideas, and that’s what I did. In the book I invite media researchers, including media anthropologists, to overcome their aversion to media effects, with the anti-woke world as my case study. So the reader is getting two books for the price of one!\n\nAs soon as I started drafting the first meaty chapter (Chapter 5) I realised that I couldn’t write only about media practices and their worldmaking effects. I also had to consider the effects of other media things, for instance, media events, dramas, and texts – what I call ‘the causal life of things.’ So I shifted from a media practice paradigm to a plural (media) paradigm. In Chapter 5, I examine a 2017 protest against Bret Weinstein, an evolutionary biologist accused of racism at Evergreen State College, in Washington. I found that emailing was the most causally significant media practice during the early stages of this Turnerian drama, while social media and TV practices had a greater impact later. How did I know this? Because the participants themselves focused on these practices, and this was corroborated by other materials I collected. Reconstructing the protests allowed me to identify the unique sets of media practices, actions, and texts that shaped their evolution at each stage of the social drama.\n\nStudying this American recent event from Australia was not very different, I imagine, from doing social historical research. Rather than a conventional ethnographic study based on participant observation, this book comes from an open-source investigation that relied on online archival materials of recent events. It is still ethnographic, I would argue, because it is driven by participants’ own priorities and schemas rather than my own.\n\nKatien Pype: How did you decide on the four major events you studied in the book, namely Trump’s electoral victory, the Covid-19 pandemic, the George Floyd protests, and the war in Ukraine?\n\nJohn Postill: When I looked back the other day at my book proposal, which I submitted more than two years ago, I was shocked to find that of the five events I said I would cover I ended up covering only one, the just mentioned Evergreen protests (linked to Trump’s shock 2016 election). The rest emerged in the process of drafting the book. I decided I needed fo"
