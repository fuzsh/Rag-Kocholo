Our Sport Management majors learn from dedicated and experienced faculty and immerse themselves in the business of sports through internships, guest speakers, and alumni in the field.\n\nFor St. John’s students interested in making connections in the world of fashion, there are few cities that compare to New York, which, along with London, England; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France, make up fashion’s “Big 4.” Our faculty work closely with students to ensure that they enter this trillion-dollar industry with the skills and business sense they need to make an impact.\n\nNew York City is also a global destination for tourists, business leaders, government officials, and others—making it a remarkable place to learn about the worlds of hospitality, food and beverage, tourism, and event management."
