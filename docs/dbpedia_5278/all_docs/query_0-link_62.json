        "text": "Lower-Division General Education\n\nFor an overview of the SF State General Education program, visit our Introduction to General Education.\n\nPlease note that although General Education courses are available to students in any major, registration in some sections of specific courses may be restricted to students in the Metro Academies.\n\nSome students come to SF State with high enough AP, CLEP, and IB scores to receive college credit. Go to the following link to see what GE requirements are satisfied by these scores. Consult with your major department to see whether any of the credit can count toward your major.\n\nAP – IB – CLEP Test Credit\n\nArea A: English Language Communication and Critical Thinking — 9 units\n\nStudents taking courses in fulfillment of Areas A1 and A2 will develop knowledge and understanding of the form, content, context, and effectiveness of communication. Students will develop proficiency in oral and written communication in English, examining communication from the rhetorical perspective and practicing reasoning and advocacy, organization, and accuracy. Students will practice the discovery, critical evaluation, and reporting of information, as well as reading, writing, and listening effectively.\n\nIn critical thinking (Area A3) courses, students will understand logic and its relation to language; elementary inductive and deductive processes, including an understanding of the formal and informal fallacies of language and thought; and the ability to distinguish matters of fact from issues of judgment or opinion. In Area A3 courses, students will develop the abilities to analyze, criticize, and advocate ideas; to reason inductively and deductively; and to reach well-supported factual or judgmental conclusions.\n\nRequirements: Students who start as freshmen must complete a minimum of nine units in Area A, including a minimum of three units in each of the following three areas: Oral Communication, Written English Communication, and Critical Thinking. Specific test and course prerequisites are printed in the Undergraduate Graduation Requirements section of the Bulletin. Beginning in Fall 2014, all Area A courses must be completed with a grade of CR or C– or better to fulfill the General Education requirement.\n\nArea A1: Oral Communication (3 units required)\n\nCourse List Code Title Units AA S 101First-Year Experience (A1, AERM)3 AFRS 120Communicating Realness: Minding the Gap (A1, AERM)3 COMM 150Fundamentals of Oral Communication (A1)3 ENG 210Oral Communication - Multilingual (A1)3\n\nArea A2: Written English Communication (3 units minimum required)\n\nCourse List Code Title Units ENG 104\n\n& ENG 105Writing the First Year: Finding Your Voice Stretch I\n\nand Writing the First Year: Finding Your Voice Stretch II (A2)6 ENG 106Writing the First Year: Finding Your Voice Stretch I and II (A2)4 ENG 114Writing the First Year: Finding Your Voice (A2)3 ENG 201\n\n& ENG 202Writing the First Year: Global Perspectives of Multilingual Speakers Stretch I\n\nand Writing the First Year: Global Perspectives of Multilingual Speakers Stretch II (A2)8 ENG 209Writing the First Year: Global Perspectives of Multilingual Speakers (A2)3\n\nArea A3: Critical Thinking (3 units required)\n\nCourse List Code Title Units AA S 110Critical Thinking and the Asian American Experience (A3, AERM)3 COUN 110Critically Thinking About Career Choice: Self, Community, Society, and the World (A3, GP, SJ)3 ETHS 110Critical Thinking and the Ethnic Studies Experience (A3, AERM)3 HIST 101Critical Thinking in History (A3, SJ)3 HSS 110Critical Thinking/Student Success in Health & Social Sciences Fields (A3)3 ISED 204Critical Thinking for Educational Equity and Social Justice (A3, AERM)3 LTNS 110Critical Thinking and the Rhetoric of Latinas/os/x in the 21st Century (A3, AERM, SJ)3 PHIL 110Introduction to Critical Thinking I (A3)3 PSY 111The Logic and Psychology of Critical Thinking (A3)3 RRS 110Critical Thinking and the Ethnic Studies Experience (A3, AERM)3\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAERM: American Ethnic and Racial Minorities\n\nES: Environmental Sustainability\n\nGP: Global Perspectives\n\nSJ: Social Justice\n\nArea B: Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning — 9 units\n\nIn Areas B1–B3, students develop knowledge of scientific theories, concepts, and data about both living and non-living systems. Students will achieve an understanding and appreciation of scientific principles and the scientific method, as well as the potential limits of scientific endeavors and the value systems and ethics associated with human inquiry.\n\nIn Area B4 courses, students shall develop skills and understanding beyond the level of intermediate algebra. Students will not just practice computational skills, but will be able to explain and apply basic mathematical concepts and will be able to solve problems through quantitative reasoning.\n\nRequirements: All students must complete a minimum of nine units in Area B including a minimum of three units in each of the following three areas: Physical Science, Life Science, and Quantitative Reasoning. Additionally, a course that satisfies the Laboratory Science requirement must also be taken.\n\nSpecific test and course prerequisites are printed in the Undergraduate Graduation Requirements section of the Bulletin.\n\nNote: Some majors require advanced coursework in Areas B1, B2, and/or B3. For students pursuing these majors, some Area B requirements will be met in major or pre-major coursework.
