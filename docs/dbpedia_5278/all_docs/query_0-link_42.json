        "text": "Core Courses\n\nThe two required core courses impart analytical skills, historical background, and theoretical underpinnings, providing a coherent knowledge base and consistent language among FMS students.\n\nCore requirement #1\n\nFMS 0001 Art of the Moving Image. (Cross-listed as ILVS 0051) This course begins with cinema, the first art of the moving image. We will study cinema’s principal, as well as its major narrative and non-narrative forms. We will watch a variety of films from the US and abroad that exemplify cinema's myriad forms and styles: mainstream and avant-garde, fiction and non-fiction, narrative and non-narrative, black-and-white and color, silent and sound. We will then consider the extent to which cinema's aesthetic features are shared by television, as well as what is artistically distinctive about TV. Theoretical concepts relevant to moving image art, principally genre, authorship, and character identification, will also be considered. No prior study of cinema or other moving image media is required.\n\nStudents should take Art of the Moving Image (FMS-0001) as their first course in the major (or aim to complete it in their first year in FMS). FMS-0001 is a pre-enrollment requisite for a number of FMS courses and must be taken before enrolling in those courses. This course is taught every semester and is open to first-years, sophomores, and juniors. Questions about the course can be directed to the instructor or Denise Cummings, Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nRequired core course for all FMS majors and minors. Pre-requisites: First-year, sophomore, or junior; or instructor permission. This course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nCore requirement #2 (choose one): Global History of Cinema (FMS-0002) OR 20th Century U.S. Television History (FMS-0006)\n\nFMS 0002 Global History of Cinema. (Cross-listed as ILVS 0052,) This course surveys the rich history of film art. We will begin with the emergence of the technologies for making and exhibiting films around 1894 and the major genres of early cinema (1895-1904), most of which were non-narrative. We will then turn our attention to the development of \"classical\" narrative film in the US in the 1900s and 1910s; the creation of alternatives to classical cinematic storytelling in the 1920s in France, Germany, the Soviet Union and elsewhere; the rise of documentary and experimental film; and the coming of synchronized sound in the late 1920s. We will see how European filmmakers on both the Left and Right responded to the increasing political turmoil in the lead-up to WWII in the 1930s while filmmakers in Japan created popular traditions of filmmaking. We will consider the impact of WWII on film history; the emergence of Italian Neo-Realism and \"modernist\" art cinema in the late 1940s and 1950s; the New Waves of the late 1950s; and political modernist, post-colonial, feminist and other radical forms of filmmaking that arose in response to the political crises of the 1960s. Finally, we will survey world cinema since the 1970s, focusing on the changes that have occurred in mainstream Hollywood filmmaking and the contributions to film art of filmmakers in Hong Kong and other non-western countries.\n\nStudents should aim to complete the second core requirement by junior year, if possible. Both are taught alternating spring semesters - typically Television History (FMS-0006) is offered in the even years and Global History (FMS-0002) in the odd years.\n\nThis course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0006 20th Century U.S. Television History. (Cross-listed as TPS 0024) This core course examines the introduction and development of U.S. television through the network era (40s-90s) as a cultural history of the medium and a subject for critical engagement by media studies scholars. We trace the development of television (in the US but within a global context) from its conception through its industrial, technical, aesthetic and textual development to understand how American broadcast television emerged as a dominant cultural force around the world. In addition to gaining a working knowledge of broadcast television in its first half-century, we will also explore how specific analytical concepts in television studies develop as we learn (and practice) how media theory takes on historical research.\n\nStudents should aim to complete the second core requirement by junior year, if possible. Both are taught alternating spring semesters - typically Television History (FMS-0006) is offered in the even years and Global History (FMS-0002) in the odd years.\n\nThis course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nOptional: Senior Honors Thesis\n\nFMS 0198 Senior Honors Thesis 1. First course in the two course FMS Senior Honors Thesis, followed by FMS 0199 Senior Honors Thesis 2 in the spring of the senior year. Students undertaking a production-based Senior Honors Thesis such as a screenplay, film, or TV show should enroll in the production section, which meets regularly in the fall semester to help students plan their production-based Senior Thesis. Students undertaking a scholarly thesis or some other non-production-based Senior Honors Thesis should enroll in the non-production section, and meet individually with their Senior Honors Thesis committee members.\n\nFMS 0199 Senior Honors Thesis 2. Second course in the two course FMS Senior Honors Thesis, preceded by FMS 0198 Senior Honors Thesis 1 in the fall of the senior year.\n\nRequired ONLY of FMS majors who are undertaking an FMS Senior Honors Thesis. Department consent required. Offered every spring. Section 01 is for production projects; section 02 is for non-production/written projects.\n\nSocial Science Courses\n\nFMS 0032 PR & Marketing: A History of Theory and Tactics. An exploration and analysis of the history of public relations and marketing communications theory in the United States and how it evolved with and influenced our media environment and public discourse. Tracing the evolution of mass persuasion through the writings of major thinkers in the field from the mid-nineteenth century through the present, we will examine how these developed in parallel with social changes including the industrial revolution, theories of human consciousness and motivation, and advances in technology, to create an all-encompassing consumer culture. Authors will range from Gustave Le Bon, Walter Lippmann, Edward Bernays and Sigmund Freud to Daniel Boorstin, Marshall McLuhan, Stuart Ewen, Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nUsing case studies, we will explore how the mechanics of this global mega industry practice strategies that influence everything from complex world affairs or simply the toothpaste we choose to buy. We will analyze advertising, images, visual design, and public relations campaigns and see how deeply these are embedded in our culture, psychology, polemics and politics, and how this is magnified by a digital reality that questions the nature of truth itself.\n\nStudents will apply these theories by working in teams to create their own marketing communications plan for a product, person, place or concept. This will include the rubric and latest thinking in the field including audience analysis, positioning strategy, messaging and examples of visual and digital communications.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0041 Cultures of Computing. (Cross-listed as ANTH 0136) Examines computers and computation as sociocultural phenomena. Questions universalizing narratives of technological progress by exploring the variety of human experience with computing. Topics include social media, postcolonial computing, the gender of artificial intelligence, the social analysis of mathematics, and the sociocultural implications of big data and contemporary algorithmic systems.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0042 Children and Mass Media. (Cross-listed as CSHD 0167) Why educators, broadcasters, advertisers, and politicians consider children a special audience of the mass media. Examination of children's media content (television, video, computers, film, and print) and the effects of media on children and adolescents. Regulations that govern children's media use, including V-chip, ratings systems, and Internet access. Student projects on media literacy and other topics.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0043 Media and Society. (Cross-listed as SOC 0040) In today's increasingly technological culture, individuals are constantly faced with choices involving media consumption. The prevalence and variety of media sources today raises questions regarding media's impact on society. This course seeks to examine the relationship between media and society, through an exploration of the factors that shape how media is produced, how media is consumed, and its effect on culture. The course incorporates analyses of key theories and concepts in media studies and sociology to allow students to engage in an examination of the changes in media over time (i.e., radio, television, and internet). In addition, the course places an emphasis on the role of the consumer in media production, and the political use of media as a means of social change.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0045 Media Literacy. (Cross-listed as CSHD 0113) Facebook executives are being brought before Congress to discuss their practices and the role the platform might have played in promoting the January 6 2021 assault on the Capitol. A recent Stanford University study found that the majority of students from middle school through college had difficulties in identifying what was really “fake news”. The 2021 Golden Globes featured performers making impassioned speeches about the need for greater diversity in Hollywood. Advertisers are marking a “biracial boom” and showing more interracial families than ever. All of these examples demonstrate why it’s more important than ever to become media literate, a crucial 21st century civic skill.\n\nMedia Literacy will cover these topics, and also feature units on social media’s use in the 2020 presidential campaign, sports and media, how social media are related to civic participation, why the space between public and private is shifting, and how growing up a part of “Gen Lit” can make a difference.\n\nFMS 0046 Anthropology of Journalism. (Cross-listed as ANTH 0133) This course introduces students to anthropological approaches to the study of journalism across cultural and political systems and across various scales. How is participation in discussions of public import regulated? How is truth publicly established within a community or a society? What are the roles of different forms of media in journalism? What is the relationship between the state and modes of knowledge production? What role do various emotions and styles have in advancing discussions of issues of public concern? We study theoretical approaches to the public and ethnographies of community news, foreign correspondence, and photojournalism. With a global perspective, we will consider how certain liberal democratic norms for journalism have propagated across contexts, as well as how geopolitical hierarchies are replicated within the field of journalism.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0047 Media of the Middle East. (Cross-listed as ANTH 0133, ILVS 0144) What can we learn about the Middle East by examining media? What can we learn about media by studying institutions of production and practices of consumption alongside media texts themselves? In this course, we will read ethnographies of media from the Middle East, look at and listen to media, and read key texts in anthropological theory on media and language. We will study: (1) media such as film, television, and music that have played a role in consolidating, contesting, and complicating colonial and postcolonial states and patriarchal norms, (2) cultural products such as Qur'anic recitations, poetry, and music that are the product of regional and global circuits, and (3) new and small media like graffiti, tweets, and poetry that have been central to the Arab Revolts and other recent political movements.\n\nThis course counts towards the anthropology area/critical geographies requirement, the World Civilization requirement, the Middle Eastern Culture/Language option, and the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0048 Visual Anthropology. (Formerly FMS 0059, Cross-listed as ANTH 0135) Development of visual anthropology from early travel documentary forms to more recent multivocal works on video. Relationship between written and visual documents. Viewing classic ethnographic films as well as contemporary films that challenge the classic genre of ethnographic films. Special attention to ethical issues in visual anthropology.\n\nFMS 0094 Ethnographic Film, Video, and Beyond. (Special Topics, Cross-Listed as ANTH-0039) Since its inception, ethnographic documentary has been a rich and richly contested field of debates about representation, colonialism, cross-cultural collaboration, and public anthropology. In this course, we learn about the history of ethnographic documentary by watching key works that have shaped the genre, as well as by examining contemporary works and practices in ethnographic documentary and multi-media projects. We will explore the theories of knowledge production, expression, and aesthetics that motivate and emerge from these works, as well as the institutional structures through which they have been produced and circulated.\n\nFMS 0094 Social Media: Potential, Promise and Problems. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as CSHD 0143) Examination of content and effects of various social media platforms on young children, adolescents and emerging adults. Exploration of social media use in learning, content creation, new boundaries between public and private spaces, identity formation and curation, membership in social groups including marginalized communities. Cultural role of memes, news dissemination, effects of social media on interpersonal communication, potential of social media for youth civic engagement.\n\nFMS 0094 Sociology of Film. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as SOC 0094) Film constitutes what Talcott Parsons has termed an \"expressive symbol system. That is to say, it is a symbol system in which the expressive orientation is dominant… and directed towards something.\" This course will foster the capacity to analyze cinema sociologically by pairing carefully selected films that address central sociological issues such as class, gender, sex, sexuality, race, ethnicity, deviance, urban life, and immigration with topical scholarship in sociology and film. We often watch movies for entertainment, paying little attention to the sociological aspects of movies. Yet, cinema influences and is shaped by ideology, social structure, norms, and social relations. And the film industry reveals the tensions between the drive to profit, make art, send a message, influence the audience, and establish power. The course delves into the way films have reproduced and challenged social conventions by contextualizing current sociological developments in cinema. We will cover topics such as feminism; masculinity in crisis; trans bodies and the horror genre; urban poverty, race, and policing; and immigration and identity in global perspective. This course will enhance students’ understanding of culture, media, and sociology by examining classical, contemporary, independent, and foreign films and related scholarship.\n\nFMS 0160 Branding Theory and Practice. (Upper level) An exploration of brands and media as transitional cultural objects that recreate our psychology, perceptions and mythologies just as we create them to further political and economic agendas. We will address the question of how our 21st century culture has changed under the influence of pervasive advertising, public relations, images and narratives that have replaced old belief systems with new, often elusive, definitions of truth, meaning and reality itself. We will tackle the concepts of Marshall McLuhan, who saw the power of media as extending our senses and thereby altering our experience of the world. We will analyze the thought structures of a consumer society through Jean Baudrillard’s system of objects, and better understand how we see the world through John Berger’s ideas on images and perception, as well as Susan Sontag’s analysis of the unique function of photographs in defining real things and events, among others. How all these concepts coalesce and accelerate in the digital world and its fast-evolving social media will frame an analysis of how opinions can be swayed at breakneck speed and blur the edges between fact and fiction in a post-modern environment.\n\nWe will ground these theories in case studies of major brands, non-profits, and issues, including Apple, Inc., Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Subaru, World Wildlife Fund, the American presidency, immigration and others. In this way, we will see how these theories are reflected in current use and if understanding them can create more effective modes of persuasion.\n\nThis course is a deep dive into the environment that produced the concepts and tactics introduced in the Fall semester course FMS 0032, Public Relations and Marketing: A History of Theory and Practice.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0032 (PR & Marketing, formerly FMS 0043) OR FMS 0033 (Social Marketing, formerly FMS 0044); or instructor permission. This course counts toward the Social Science distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0161 Seminar in Mass Media Studies: Digital Hate. (Upper level, Cross-listed as SOC 0185) We have developed powerful new internet and communications technologies that democratize the ability to participate in public discourse, and the development of new kinds of social relationships, but which also facilitate—and in many cases anonymize—venomous critics focused on personal attacks rather than productive engagement. What's more, technology has outpaced the legal infrastructures we have to cope with this phenomenon. This new seminar will explore trolling, digital harassment, and technology facilitated violence, with particular attention to the way digital life varies for people from different backgrounds. Attention will be paid to the complex balance between freedom of speech, civil rights, democratic vitality, and personal safety. It will be of particular interest for students interested in media, technology, social inequality, culture, and politics.\n\nRecommendations: Junior standing, SOC 0040, and permission of instructor.\n\nFMS 0162 Media, the State, and the Senses. (Upper level, Cross-listed as ANTH 0164) This upper level seminar examines the social practices of media production, circulation, and reception. Media are both the products of and means for social, cultural, and political transformation. In studying media, we will examine their relationship to transformations of space-time perceptions, the shaping of political identities, and the constitution of complex (social, political, economic, institutional, and/or creative) connections among people and groups. How are media mobilized by states to consolidate powers? How do people challenge these authorities' attempts? Media also work on the senses, even as individuals and institutions seek to shape how they do so. In this class, we will attend to the possibilities and limitations offered by different media, due to their material forms, institutional structures, and perceptual forms. Students will have the opportunity to conduct brief media ethnographies.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0163 New Media, New Politics. (Upper level, Cross-listed as PS 0104) Research seminar on three media sectors: cable television, talk radio, and social media. Analysis of the economic foundations of each sector, advertising, audience demographics, and strategy. Student teams conduct an original empirical study of the media.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0164 Seminar in Children and the Mass Media. (Upper level, Cross-listed as CD 0267) Do media images really affect what children grow up thinking about race, gender and class? Is there actually a relationship between playing violent video games and school shootings? Why is it important to have images of disability in children’s media? Does advertising create unhealthy eating practices in children? Do unrealistic media images cultivate unrealistic body images in adolescents? Can media be used to promote positive social change and civic engagement in young people?\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered about these questions, the Seminar on Children and Media will help give the tools to answer them. This upper level course digs in deep, training you to critically evaluate studies you read, parse the summaries of sensationalized research about children and media that appears in the popular press, and introduces you to ways of investigating the images and effects of media on children. Several research-based practice and professionals who create media images and evaluate them come share their expertise with the class as resources.\n\nThis course counts for the 21st century literacies concentrations in Child Study and Human Development, as an elective in Civic Studies and as an upper level course for the FMS major. It’s open to juniors, seniors and graduate students.\n\nTheory Courses\n\nFMS 0040 Beyond McLuhan: Media Theory for the 21st Century. When Marshall McLuhan's well-known phrase that \"the medium is the message\" was published in the late 1950s, he set off a debate among media theorists and practitioners. Though the platforms of today differ, some of the questions and debates remain. This course will examine traditional mass media theories and explore the extent to which they apply to newer digital and social communication platforms and research. The course considers social reality theories including agenda setting and para-social interaction, functional theories including theories about media violence, cultivation and the diffusion of innovation, and theories about mass media and mass culture. What does it mean to learn within a participatory culture created by social media? What are the ensuing media ecologies that are created? How do media shape fan culture? To what extent does the appropriation of mass media and digital cultures blur the boundaries of narrative, and to what extent might they alter our sense of the boundaries between the public and private domains? How do traditional and new media platforms contribute to attitude change and social modeling? The focus of this class will be critical, using theory to understand research and as well as media practice.\n\nFMS 0044 Introduction to Media Culture and Theory. (Cross-listed as TPS 0022 and ILVS 0054) This course serves as an introduction to the study of popular media culture. Through readings, viewings and discussions, students will become familiar with the major areas of study, theoretical principles, methodologies, and debates that have shaped popular media studies in the past several decades. Among these are theories of representation, labor and authorship, contemporary media convergence, fandom and participatory culture, media globalization, the rise of reality television, game studies, industry and audience research, online content creation and more. Student will develop a knowledge base in qualitative media studies, its history, intellectual development, and theoretical milestones as they hone their skills in media criticism and analysis.\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0048 Visual Anthropology. (Cross-listed as ANTH 0135) Development of visual anthropology from early travel documentary forms to more recent multivocal works on video. Relationship between written and visual documents. Viewing classic ethnographic films as well as contemporary films that challenge the classic genre of ethnographic films. Special attention to ethical issues in visual anthropology.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Science distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0049 Political Cinema. (Cross-listed as ENG 0082) Analysis of films that both represent politics in its familiar manifestations (campaigns, elections, revolutions, movements for rights and liberties) and explore the politics of cinematic form. Primary focus on mainstream fictional cinema in the U.S., but some attention to documentaries, non-Hollywood U.S. films, and political cinema in other countries. Readings in film theory, film criticism, and cultural criticism.\n\nFMS 0065 Film Theory. (Cross-listed with ILVS 0061) What is cinema? Is it a mass entertainment medium or an art? And if it is an art, how is it different to other artistic mediums to which it bears a resemblance, such as theater and literature? Is it a tool of enlightenment that reveals reality as it really is, or a tool of deception offering merely an \"illusion\" of reality? How does it affect viewers, cognitively and emotionally? Can it change society for the better, or does it merely reproduce relations of power? These, and many other fascinating questions, have been debated widely by film theorists--many of them also filmmakers--almost since cinema's inception in the 1890s. Due to cinema's enormous popularity in the 20th century, they have also attracted the attention of intellectuals more generally, such as Rudolf Arnheim, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and Gilles Deleuze. Film theory has, moreover, tended to be an inter-disciplinary affair, drawing on the latest developments in psychology, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, the natural sciences, and philosophy. This course will survey the rich history of film theory in depth. We will examine the debates about cinema's nature and functions that emerged in the 1920s; the widespread, utopian belief in its potential to change both human beings and society for the better prevalent before WWII; the countervailing view, often held by Marxists, that the cinema is a tool of domination and control; the turn since WWII to theoretical paradigms such as linguistics, psychoanalysis, and cognitivism to answer questions about the cinema; feminist and postcolonial interventions into film theory in the 1970s and 1980s; and the wholesale critique of film theory undertaken by theorists and philosophers trained in Anglo-American analytical philosophy since the 1990s. The only pre-requisite for this course is a commitment to analytical thinking, in-depth reading, and rational debate. One required screening per week.\n\nThis course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0066 Philosophy and Film. (Cross-listed as PHIL 0054) This course explores whether and how the relatively young medium of film has extended the horizon of possibilities for the age-old practice of philosophy—whether, to put the issue another way, film is somehow an inherently philosophical medium. Like works of literature and other forms of art, movies routinely press upon their viewers questions that lie at the heart of ethics: What is the best or right thing to do? How should human beings treat one another? What sorts of duties and obligations do we have? What is the best sort of life to live? But as a medium consisting essentially of nothing other than celluloid, light, and shadows, film is also particularly—perhaps even uniquely—well-suited to raise certain metaphysical and epistemological questions: What is real, and what illusion? How can we tell? How reliable is the \"knowledge\" we think we have? What is a person? How can we know for sure, if we can, what someone else is really thinking or feeling?\n\nIn this course we will explore the thesis that film, as a medium, tends to conflate these metaphysical and epistemological concerns with the ethical ones—that it brings a certain richness and complexity to certain questions on which moral philosophers have focused. We will explore this complexity by comparing how various philosophers and various films frame and respond to the question: What is the cost of civilization?\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0081 Hitchcock: Cinema, Gender, Ideology (cross-listed as ENG-0080, ILVS-0057) Alfred Hitchcock: the name is synonymous not only with cinematic suspense, but also with the appeal of film as both a medium of popular entertainment and the distinctive art form of the twentieth century. Hitchcock's undiminished appeal reflects our continuing fascination with the visual satisfactions classic cinema affords and with the possibilities inherent in the genres (thriller, suspense film, romantic melodrama) in which Hitchcock primarily worked. This course will explore the relation between Hitchcock's achievement of cinematic \"mastery\" and his constant, even obsessive, attention to questions of gender, sexuality, and socio-cultural authority–questions that underlie his explorations of narrative suspense. We will examine how \"seeing\" in Hitchcock's films is the join between politics and erotics, inflecting cinematic spectatorship in the direction of such erotic (and political) \"perversions\" as voyeurism, fetishism, sadism, and masochism—\"perversions\" that find expression in the stylistic falir of Hitchcock's films. With this in mind we will consider the pleasures that Hitchcock's style affords: Whose pleasure is it? To what does it respond? How does its insistent perversity affect our understanding of his work? We will try to answer these questions by reading a number of essays on Hitchcock and cinema, including recent interventions from the perspectives of psychoanalysis, feminism, and queer theory. In that sense, this course will introduce students to theories of cinematic interpretation. But our engagement with ways of reading film (in an interdisciplinary and cross-cultural framework) will be filtered through the close and careful study of some of the most complex, compelling, and influential texts in cinematic history. These will include The 39 Steps, Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Notorious, Rope, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, and The Birds. Students will be encouraged to attend showings of the films on the library's large screen in Tisch 304, but they will be permitted to watch the movies on their own (before the day of class discussion, of course) if they cannot attend the weekly screenings. This course fulfills the post-1860 requirement for English majors.\n\nThis course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0087 Postmodernism and Film. (Cross-listed as ENG 0081) We encounter, perhaps even use, the word \"postmodern\" with some regularity. But do we really know what it means? This course will introduce students to major aspects of postmodern thought (as articulated by critics and philosophers including Jacques Derrida, Judith Butler, Slavoj Žižek, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Frederic Jameson, Donna Haraway, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, and Jean Baudrillard) by studying a variety of films that engage or mobilize postmodern concepts. We will explore the tensions between modernist and postmodernist views of the world in the context of a number of other relations as well, including those between film and philosophy, between technology and interpretation, between meaning and image, and between what Barthes calls \"the work and the text.\" Although we will carefully attend to a wide variety of films that raise issues central to postmodernism, that doesn't mean that the films we will be studying are themselves postmodern films. Instead, we will suggest that postmodernism in cinema is inescapable and impossible at once. This course will make clear just what that means and why it might be so. The following are likely to be among the cinematic texts we examine in class: the Wachowski's The Matrix, Scott's Blade Runner, Lassiter's Toy Story, Polanski's Chinatown, Zemeckis's Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Fincher's Fight Club, Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, Nolan's Memento, Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Luhrman's Moulin Rouge, and Haneke's Funny Games. This course does not presuppose any prior experience of literary theory or cinematic analysis and all serious students, whatever their background or major, are welcome to enroll. But the class will be off-putting for those resistant to dealing with complex ideas or unwilling to think about film as more than a medium of popular entertainment.\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0094 The Horror Film. This course on the horror film is designed for both FMS students and non-FMS students seeking an in-depth historical and theoretical understanding of the horror film. We will study the history of the horror film from its beginning in the 1920s through to the present day, focusing on classic, influential films such as Nosferatu; Frankenstein; Dracula; The Thing from Another World; Psycho; Night of the Living Dead; The Exorcist; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Halloween; and Alien. We will also watch more recent films like Scream, The Babadook, and Get Out. While most of the films we examine will be from North America, we will occasionally make forays into Japanese horror (Godzilla, The Ring), and we will pay equal attention to the creative innovations of individual filmmakers and the conventions of the genre within which they work. We will consider whether the genre reflects if not promotes the fears of American society as well as its representation of gender and race. We will also address some of the larger philosophical and theoretical questions it raises: what, precisely, is horror? Why do we enjoy watching films which make us feel ostensibly undesirable emotions such as fear and disgust, emotions which, in our ordinary lives, we tend to avoid?\n\nFMS 0094 AI in Motion: Ethics, Innovation, and Impact in Digital Media Industries (Special Topics) In this course, students will delve into the transformative role of AI in digital media industries, with a particular focus on cinema and television. Through a praxis-based model, participants will critically engage with theoretical and empirical texts to uncover the history and navigate the current ethical debates surrounding AI. The course aims to equip students with a nuanced understanding of AI's impact on contemporary media practices, alongside hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools for text, sound, image, and motion picture generation. By examining interdisciplinary perspectives and engaging with the latest industry trends, students will emerge with a comprehensive skill set, ready to critically analyze and creatively engage with the future of AI in media.\n\nFMS 0094 Women's Visions in Global Film (Special Topics, Cross-listed as ILVS 0091) How do we define women’s film? Given its formal and cultural diversity, is this a productive or reductive categorization? What are the principal preoccupations of female directors and how do they negotiate scopophilia of the established filmmaking tradition? How do they depict female subjectivity with regard to race, class, and sexuality and what type of discourse do they generate within their cultural environments? How do they navigate the body politics in various global contexts? What are the challenges securing funding and visibility on the (inter) national production and distribution circuits? These are some of the questions to be addressed in this course. Relying on cine-feminist and postcolonial theory and critical scholarship, we will watch a vast array of 21st century films by female filmmakers from all continents and examine their aesthetic, cultural, and political aspects. We will look into the mechanisms of highlighting women’s issues and analyze the impact these auteurs had on established socio-cultural and artistic practices. Some of the directors include Leila Djansi, Agnès Varda, Susanne Bier, Mira Nair, Lulu Wang, Jasmila Žbanić, Naomi Kawase, and others.\n\nFMS 0094 Intro to Film Theory. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as ILVS 0092) Arguably more than any other art form, film has the potential to foster the illusion of reality. As such, it generates a multitude of questions: Can we consider cinema to be a true art form, even though it reproduces the external world in apparently mechanical fashion? How does our experience living life compare with our experience as spectators of film? How does film condition our perceptions of time and space? What are the consequences (representational, psychological, ethical) of filming and disseminating scenes of unspeakable violence or trauma? Is viewing a film analogous to dreaming while asleep, and may we therefore analyze films just as we would dreams and the unconscious?\n\nThis course is an introductory survey of the critical concepts in film theory from the classical pre-1968 period to the present. We will read representational texts from Formalist, Realist, Soviet, and Semiology/Suture theory, and follow the trajectory to critical race, feminist, and queer theory. Many of the great film theorists were also filmmakers, and we will raise questions about the mutual reverberations of praxis and theory. Students will be encouraged, for example, to stake their own positions in the great debates about suture theory, and how they perceive the relationship between spectator and screen in Hitchcock's continuity editing. Film theory owes an enormous debt to philosophy—aesthetics, ontology, phenomenology, psychoanalysis; and we will periodically reference those philosophers critical to the development of film theory—Heidegger, Ayfre, Benjamin, Bergson, Lacan.\n\nWe will establish the frameworks and fundamental questions that film theory inherited from philosophy. We will ask whether film can do the work of philosophy—that is, whether film itself can be construed as a mode of thought, as Stanley Cavell has proposed. Is film, and not merely film theory, on a continuum with philosophical thought? Or does it represent a radical new mode of philosophizing? We will analyze Gilles Deleuze's reframing of cinema as the evolution from the movement-image to the time-image and the implications of his model for the study of film and philosophy.\n\nFMS 0094 Audio Storytelling: From Old Time Radio to Podcasting. (Special Topics) In 1981, MTV kicked off its music video programming with The Buggles \"Video Killed the Radio Star,\" a music video celebrating and/or critiquing the power of images over pure sound. Almost 40 years later, however, radio is still going strong. Moreover, audio storytelling has experienced a rebirth in the form of podcasting. This course explores the history and theory behind audio storytelling. From pre-television narrative radio, to ethnic and/or niche programming, from BBC dramas, to modern podcasts, we will explore how different groups have spoken to each other and outsiders through audio forms. We will also explore the process of producing audio narratives, culminating in a podcast.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image, formerly FMS 0020) OR FMS major/minor; or instructor permission.\n\nFMS 0094 Media Ethics. (Special Topics) The course aims at analyzing the ethical dimensions of communication and the media. It will address questions like: what is a good communication? Can communication and the media contribute to a better and more just society? What role do they have in shaping personal identity and interpersonal relations? In order to answer these and other questions, the course will integrate theoretical reflection and analysis of concrete cases. Different relevant media will be taken into account, with a specific focus on the new media and the ethical issues raised by information and communications technology (ICT). Topics include: objectivity and neutrality in journalism, the significance of \"fake news,\" reality and fiction in television, the impact of social networks, and ethical issues in cyberspace.\n\nFMS 0094 The Horror Film: Gender, Race, and Genre. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as ILVS 0094) This course will explore how horror films represent and intersect with gender and race. We will view films spanning the mid-twentieth century to the present day, and study their relations to specific historical and cultural contexts, social movements, developments in the genre, and theoretical writings on race and gender. We will investigate examples from various subgenres in which fear and disgust are closely intertwined with gender and racial differences, such as slasher, revenge, black horror, and mother horror. Broad questions about the horror genre’s popular appeal will be examined alongside theories that account for differences in how horror films are experienced. Many of the films we will study are North American, but we will also look into influential films from other national and cultural contexts, such as Japanese horror and global art cinema.\n\nFMS 0165: Television in the Age of Change. (Upper Level, Cross-listed as ILVS 0072 & TPS 0121) This course offers an introduction to television studies and media theory through an in-depth look at contemporary television and its radical transformations along recent technical, industrial, creative and cultural changes. Throughout the class, we will focus on recent television theory and how scholars have addressed major issues and debates in contemporary television. Among these will be narratives and genres, programming conventions, global trends, the creative industry, streaming content, webTV and audience and fan practices. As we read this work and analyze television texts, we will consider how these various changes imperil, enrich, and transform television as we know it.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image, formerly FMS 0020) OR FMS major/minor; or instructor permission. This course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0180 Psychoanalysis and Cinema. (Upper Level, Cross-listed as ENG 0180 & ILVS 0180) Psychoanalysis, however we may view it as an institution or a therapeutic practice, has profoundly affected how most of us think about sexuality, subjectivity, and everyday practices. The world would look quite different without such concepts as the unconscious, fetishism, oedipal rivalry, identification, and the drives. And who could imagine cinema in the absence of those concepts? In the same way that psychoanalysis seems to presuppose the cinematic apparatus (as key terms like \"projection,\" \"the primal scene,\" or the \"dream-screen\" would suggest), so cinema and cinema theory can seem to presuppose psychoanalysis as well. This course will explore psychoanalysis and cinema together in three specific ways: by looking at how we can understand psychoanalysis through cinema; by looking at psychoanalysis as represented in cinema; and by looking at psychoanalytic logics as essential to the practice of cinema. Each week we will read texts of psychoanalytic theory (including psychoanalytic film theory) in relation to cinematic works that exemplify, respond to, or illuminate them. We will explore in particular how the theories of sexuality at the heart of psychoanalysis shape both the form and content of cinematic representation. Readings may include works by such authors as Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Slavoj Žižek, Jane Gallop, Christian Metz, Joan Copjec, Mary Anne Doane, Leo Bersani, Barbara Creed, Stephen Heath, Kaja Silverman, Laura Mulvey, and Raymond Bellour. Films to be studied may include Spellbound and Marnie (Hitchcock), Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), Apocalypse Now (Coppola), The Piano Teacher (Haneke), Moonlight (Jenkins), The Silence of the Lambs (Demme), Persona (Bergman), Pressure Point (Cornfield), Peeping Tom (Powell), Melancholia (Von Trier), There Will Be Blood (Anderson), and Eve's Bayou (Lemmons). No more than 16 students will be admitted into the class and registration will be limited to those who are majoring in English or Film and Media Studies. Others who wish to enroll may request permission by emailing the instructor and explaining either how the class addresses their interests or their academic plans or by indicating that they plan to major in English or Film and Media Studies.\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0184 Film and Modernism. (Upper Level, Cross-listed as ENG, ILVS, FAH-0150) Central to modernism--that vast, diverse movement that transformed the arts in the late 19th and 20th centuries--was the desire to modernize art, to break with tradition and cultivate new artistic forms and styles more suited to the modern world. But how did modernism impact the cinema, given that, as a new medium, it initially lacked traditions to break with? In this upper-level seminar, we will consider what modernism was in general, and how it initially took root in film. Beginning with German Expressionism of the 1920s, arguably the first modernist movement in cinema, we will examine how filmmakers in Europe and beyond sought to create equivalents of modernism in the fine arts, theater, and literature while simultaneously attempting to purify film of these arts. We will see how modernist filmmakers negotiated the transition to sound in the late 1920s as well as the re-emergence of varieties of realism in the politically charged 1930s and war-torn 1940s. After considering whether Italian Neo-Realism is a form of modernism, we will turn out attention to European filmmakers who cultivated innovative forms and styles in the post-war period often in dialogue with Hollywood genre filmmaking. We will also look at the extent to which modernism influenced filmmakers working in the studio system in the United States and beyond, such as in Japan. Finally, we will return to Europe to witness the politicization of modernism in the late 1960s and will ask whether modernist cinema, as many have argued, came to an end in the 1970s and has been replaced by postmodernism. We will study at least some of the following filmmakers: Akerman, Antonioni, Bergman, Bresson, Clair, Dulac, Eisenstein, Epstein, Fellini, Godard, Hitchcock, Jansco, Kawalerowicz, Kinugasa, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lang, Makavejev, Oshima, Pabst, Resnais, Rossellini, and Varda. This is a 4 SHU, upper-level course with one mandatory screening per week. As this is an upper-level seminar, students are required to research and write a research paper of at least 4,000 words.\n\nPrerequisite: FMS-0001 OR FMS-0002 or FMS-0087 OR ENG-0081; or instructor permission\n\nFMS 0186 How Films Think. (Upper Level, Cross-listed as ENG 0186) This upper-level seminar is intended for serious students of film who want to explore how cinema creates a complex language through which to think. Although we'll cover such specific aspects of the medium as montage, the long take, point of view, shot/reverse shot, framing, and other elements of cinematic rhetoric, we will focus more precisely on how specific directors deploy those devices to subjectivize the camera as the locus of authorship and thought. We will study, that is, how visual style produces, complements, reframes, and undoes a movie's surface narrative by generating the need to read that narrative in relation to the function of the camera. What does the movement of the camera do to the image that it depicts? How does it underscore, ironize, or \"think\" about the \"content\" of the image itself? To answer these questions we will focus on works by six American directors acclaimed for their mastery of cinematic style: Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Quentin Tarantino, and David Lynch. Films to be examined will probably include Citizen Kane, The Lady from Shanghai, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Godfather (Parts I and II), 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and Kill Bill (Volumes 1 and 2). Students must be willing to participate actively in conversation and intellectual exchange. They will be responsible for group presentations on a regular basis throughout the semester. This course fulfills the post-1860 requirement.\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0194 Screening Paranoia (Special Topics) From worries about digital surveillance, to the widespread dissemination of misinformation, we seem to live in a paranoid age. But anxieties about technology and an atmosphere of mistrust are hardly new phenomena. We will see how emerging technologies have been met with fear throughout history—from beliefs that early electronic media such as radio could contact other worlds, to more contemporary anxieties about digital technologies tracking our every behavior. We will trace how popular media such as film have represented paranoia, from 1950s science fiction to 1970s thrillers, and conclude by examining how digital media have helped to make conspiracy theories a central part of mainstream political discourse.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image); or instructor permission\n\nFMS 0194 Audio Storytelling: From Old Time Radio to Podcasting. (Upper Level, Special Topics) In 1981, MTV kicked off its music video programming with The Buggles \"Video Killed the Radio Star,\" a music video celebrating and/or critiquing the power of images over pure sound. Almost 40 years later, however, radio is still going strong. Moreover, audio storytelling has experienced a rebirth in the form of podcasting. This course explores the history and theory behind audio storytelling. From pre-television narrative radio, to ethnic and/or niche programming, from BBC dramas, to modern podcasts, we will explore how different groups have spoken to each other and outsiders through audio forms. We will also explore the process of producing audio narratives, culminating in a podcast. Upper level.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image) or FMS major or minor; or instructor permission.\n\nFMS 0194 Israeli Cinema and TV in a Regional and Global Context. (Upper Level, Special Topics, Cross-listed as TPS 0194, ILVS 0091, JS 0092) In the past few decades, Israeli films and television shows have circulated widely around the world, as original productions and as source material for local adaptations. In this course we will examine contemporary Israeli films and TV in terms of their narrative and style and think broadly about the relationship between local specificity and global appeal. In our readings, screenings and discussions, we will explore how these works engage with Israel's Palestinian conflict and occupation, the region’s embattled history, religious and ethnic friction, queer and gendered identities, and Arab and Palestinian creators' work in Israel’s media industries. Throughout, we will consider how film and media respond, critique, and take part in social, cultural and political change. The course includes mandatory weekly readings and screenings. All screenings are subtitled – no knowledge of Hebrew or Arabic is required.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image) or FMS 0044 (Intro to Media Culture and Theory); or instructor permission\n\nFMS 0194 Media and the Environment. (Special Topics) The early filmmaker D.W. Griffith praised film’s capacity to capture “the beauty of wind moving in the trees,” thus echoing an idea that was common to much of the early discourse on photography and cinema: that these media brought people into contact with real, physical nature. As conceptions of humanity’s place in the environment have evolved, so too have the ways that people use media to represent nonhuman nature. We will look closely at how movies and other popular media have depicted nature, and examine how audiovisual media have been used within the environmental movement, from the conservation efforts of the mid-20th century to the increasingly urgent efforts of activists in the era of climate change. We will read work by prominent scholars in ecocriticism, and view a wide range of media, looking at narrative, documentary, and experimental practices.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0001 (Art of the Moving Image) OR FMS major or minor; or instructor permission.\n\nFMS 0194 Seminar in English: Political Cinema. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as ENG 0191) What makes a film “political”? In this seminar, we will look at a series of films that do two things: they represent politics in its familiar manifestations--campaigns, elections, revolutions, counter-revolutions, movements in favor of rights and liberations--but they also explore and exploit the politics of cinematic form. Instead of simply asking how these films portray politics, in other words, we will be approaching them with a view toward understanding the interplay between politics and cinema. We will focus on mainstream fictional cinema in the United States, but we will also consider documentaries, non-Hollywood U.S. films, and political cinema in other countries. We will be juxtaposing more or less recent films with “classics” from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Films likely to be chosen include: Sorry to Bother You (Riley), City Hall (Wiseman), The Last Hurrah (Ford), Selma (DuVernay), The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer), The Battle of Algiers (Pontecorvo), Malcolm X (Lee), One Night in Miami (King), Dr. Strangelove (Kubrick), Nashville (Altman), A Face in the Crowd (Kazan), Salt of the Earth (Biberman), Vice (McKay). Readings in film theory, film criticism, and cultural criticism will be an essential part of the course. Students will be required to write a few short (two-to-three-page) papers and one longer (ten-page) research paper.\n\nFilm and Media Practice Courses\n\nFMS 0010 Film and Media Production I.

This course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0022 New Forms of Screen Narrative. (Cross-listed as ENG 12)This is a course in basic screen narrative. We will spend the first weeks of the course learning how a film narrative is usually structured - though we will, of course, pay due attention to other possible ways of producing dramatic tension and audience involvement. The class will workshop their story ideas – first in a condensed form of four pages, and then in a longer form of twelve pages. After that we will turn to the basics of script formatting, and students will begin writing the sections of their film’s first thirty pages. We will workshop those pages (and more, depending on how quickly each student proceeds) throughout the rest of the course.\n\nFMS 0024 Acting for the Camera (Cross-listed as TPS 0093) On stage, the audience may be anywhere from a few feet away in the front row to the back row of the second balcony, and the job of the actor is to reach every audience member from the closest to the furthest away. How does this change on camera when the ‘audience’ is only inches away from the performer's face. In this course students will explore and unpack the long held belief that with on camera acting “less in more” and discover that the more accurate phrase is: “Less externalized is more effective, however the energy, listening and commitment of the actor remains the same”.\n\nFMS 0025 Costume Design. (Cross-listed as TPS 71) Development of the skills of script analysis, rendering, and process for the design of costumes.

(Cross-listed with TPS00 31) This course is designed to be a survey course in décor, style and architecture from early Egyptian to Modern American. Its intention is to give architects, interior designers and designers for film, television and theater a basic working knowledge of period and style in regards to interior decor and architectural style. Because of the vast amount of history and material that needs to be covered during the semester it will be difficult to study any one period in any considerable depth. For this reason we will spend more time on the early foundations of décor and architecture and cover the subsequent periods more swiftly. We will spend the first month covering the Egyptian, Crete-Mycenae, Greek and Roman periods. After an exam on the first section we will proceed quickly through Early Christian, Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic, English Medieval, and the Italian Renaissance. After another exam we will spend the rest of the semester working quickly through Modern American. The course will be taught through a series of power point lectures which will include various clips from documentaries and period films.\n\nThis course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0030 Creative Writing: Journalism. (Cross-listed as ENG 0007) This course is an introduction to the nuts-and-bolts of journalism. We'll focus on researching and writing news stories, features, profiles, opinion pieces, and reviews. The aim of the course will be to develop reporting and interviewing skills, master journalistic principles and forms, and encourage clear thinking and clear writing. Students will cover stories both on- and off-campus. They will read their work in class, with class members taking on the roles of editors. We'll also take a close look at the local and national press and examine how they cover various stories.\n\nPre-requisites: ENG 0001 and ENG 0002 or ENG 0003 and ENG 0004 or equivalent(s). This course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0031 Intermediate Journalism. (Cross-listed as ENG 0011) What the news media will be like in the coming years is up for grabs, but the nuts and bolts of good journalism remain the same: getting the story by tuning into events and getting people to tell us what the public needs to know; finding and using sources effectively; investigating and analyzing events; and reporting it all accurately, clearly, and engagingly. This course gives you, as a student journalist, the opportunity to sharpen these skills by writing stories regularly as you learn the craft and business of the field. You'll work mostly independently on topics of your choosing to practice news reporting, and feature writing for various journalism platforms. We’ll also discuss practical, ethical, and legal issues in the news media among ourselves and with professional journalists.\n\nPrerequisite: Familiarity with the basics of reporting.\n\nPre-requisites: ENG 0001 and ENG 0002 or ENG 0003 and ENG 0004 or equivalent(s). This course counts toward the Arts distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0032 PR & Marketing: A History of Theory and Tactics. An exploration and analysis of the history of public relations and marketing communications theory in the United States and how it evolved with and influenced our media environment and public discourse. Tracing the evolution of mass persuasion through the writings of major thinkers in the field from the mid-nineteenth century through the present, we will examine how these developed in parallel with social changes including the industrial revolution, theories of human consciousness and motivation, and advances in technology, to create an all-encompassing consumer culture. Authors will range from Gustave Le Bon, Walter Lippmann, Edward Bernays and Sigmund Freud to Daniel Boorstin, Marshall McLuhan, Stuart Ewen, Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nUsing case studies, we will explore how the mechanics of this global mega industry practice strategies that influence everything from complex world affairs or simply the toothpaste we choose to buy. We will analyze advertising, images, visual design, and public relations campaigns and see how deeply these are embedded in our culture, psychology, polemics and politics, and how this is magnified by a digital reality that questions the nature of truth itself.\n\nStudents will apply these theories by working in teams to create their own marketing communications plan for a product, person, place or concept. This will include the rubric and latest thinking in the field including audience analysis, positioning strategy, messaging and examples of visual and digital communications.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0033 Social Marketing: Theory and Practice. Explores the field of social marketing, which uses marketing concepts and tools to promote political and social causes such as eliminating poverty and creating equality. Examines the theories and history of this field using authors from psychology, media studies, and social and commercial marketing. Analyzes case studies of how marketing has succeeded in persuading consumers to invest in political and social causes the same way they do in commodities, changing behavior to improve health, the environment, voting, and social justice among others. Team projects applying these theories by partnering with local non-profit organizations, analyzing each organization’s communications and marketing goals, and providing them with a marketing communications plan that includes both new strategies and tactics such as logos, web pages, print materials, or event and outreach concepts.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0034 Creating Children’s Media. (Cross-listed as CSHD 0143) Good media for kids comes from a recipe of creativity, understanding children, knowing media conventions - and having a sense of adventure and fun! In this class you’ll learn how to apply theories of child development and research about children’s media and try your hand at creating some new children’s media of your own. We’ll talk about what makes children’s media educational, about how children’s media can be created in diverse and equitable ways that address issues of social justice, and we’ll see how media can be used to get children civically engaged. We will try our hands at: Making a pitch to take a children’s book and turn it into a movie, writing an episode of an original children’s television show or a spec script for an existing show, writing a proposal for a children’s educational app. Many children’s media professionals (writers, directors, producers) will join us as guest speakers and as future contacts.\n\nThis course counts toward the Social Sciences distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0051 Storytelling: Radio/Podcasts (Cross-listed as MDIA-0166) This course examines theoretical and practical aspects of audio storytelling.Via collective listening sessions, seminar discussions and practical assignments, we will explore genres, techniques and approaches to tell stories through sound. Thanks to the Internet and to podcast distribution, a revival of narrative sound formats is underway. This recent wave of interest tackles an interdisciplinary field between radio, literature, music, theater, poetry, journalism, politics and contemporary art – an area yet to be defined, historically and theoretically. This course will explore this hybrid territory. We will map different histories of audio storytelling, while experiencing works by pioneering figures and contemporary practitioners, as well as actively engaging in making audio stories.\n\nFMS 0067 Composition for Film. (Cross-listed as MUS 0067) Introduction to composing music for a variety of visual media, including film, video games, and advertising. Access to the music lab where students produce their work hands on.

Students will develop either an original pilot or write a spec episode of an existing show, as well as learning about the writers room, developing a show bible, show running, TV genres, and the nuts and bolts of the role of the writer in the production process.\n\nFMS 0094 Half the History: Finding, Creating, and Amplifying Women’s Historical Stories through Media (New, Sp24) Half the History: Finding, Creating, and Amplifying Women’s Historical Stories through Media is an interdisciplinary course combining history, theory, and practice. We’ll be exploring some of the ways in which women’s stories have – and have not – been told, how archives have not systematically saved and curated the stories of women’s lives, and how the lives of women of color have been even less preserved. We’ll focus on reframing questions that will enable us to tell historical stories in new ways.\n\nStudents will gain hands-on producing experience working together on films, podcasts, and short biographies for the Half the History series on under-told stories of women in U.S. history and will also create an individual Half the History passion project. We’ll be developing materials for viewers/listeners/readers of different ages, and talking about how media producers might incorporate child development theory and practice in their work.

Yet, we know that the “truths” found in traditional archives are incomplete: books and mainstream film productions are often biased while silences and omissions enter every level of archive-making and historical production. This course proposes an innovative approach to archiving and researching through the engagement, analysis and recovery of oral histories and artistic productions of immigrants (loosely defined to include second generations, refugees, undocumented, and new citizens) as they appear in film, media and cultural productions. Students will engage in the critical analysis of the historical relationship between race, diaspora, and citizenship. Building on original stories and artistic materials presented in class, students will then contribute to the production of a digital archive and network that connects people, objects and events across the globe. The archives can be created via different mediums, including film. Our goal is to make the archive a tool for teaching and learning as well as a functional artistic piece for the larger community. Pre-requisites: RCD-0005; or instructor permission\n\nFMS 0094 Acting for TV and Film. (Special Topics, Cross-listed as TPS 0093) This is an on camera acting course.

(Special Topics) In 1981, MTV kicked off its music video programming with The Buggles \"Video Killed the Radio Star,\" a music video celebrating and/or critiquing the power of images over pure sound. Almost 40 years later, however, radio is still going strong. Moreover, audio storytelling has experienced a rebirth in the form of podcasting. This course explores the history and theory behind audio storytelling. From pre-television narrative radio, to ethnic and/or niche programming, from BBC dramas, to modern podcasts, we will explore how different groups have spoken to each other and outsiders through audio forms. We will also explore the process of producing audio narratives, culminating in a podcast.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS-0001 (Art of the Moving Image, formerly FMS 0020) OR FMS major or minor; or instructor permission.\n\nFMS 0094 Costume Design for Film, TV, and New Media.

The course will include a field trip to WGBH to participate in a hackathon to design new media products for children.\n\nFMS 0094 Film Criticism: Art and Practice (Special Topics,) This class will examine movie reviewing as both a practice and an art, and it will use the form to springboard to a larger engagement with cultural analysis as a whole. What does it mean to think critically about the media and popular culture through which we swim every day? What tools are needed to decode its messages? The course will function partly as a historical survey largely (but not wholly) focusing on American writers such as James Agee, Manny Farber, Andrew Sarris, and Pauline Kael. As we move into the modern day, topics will include the rise of genre-based criticism, the schisms and fragmentation of specialist critics and agendas, and how the form and substance of cultural criticism can change with the container (tweet, blog post, episode recap) in which it appears. A second, parallel track will focus on students learning to write professional film and cultural criticism for themselves. Through weekly screenings of classic films and current theatrical releases, and through regular writing and in-class peer editing of reviews, students will receive a grounding in formulating opinions for public consumption in ways that combine journalistic integrity, contextual knowledge, and an individualistic voice that makes for a \"good read.\"\n\nFMS 0094 Game Design.

Workshops and assignments will guide you in creating works that explore an expanded range of sound’s potentials within film’s interplay of looking, listening, and imagining. Rather than begin with sound in relation to the film image, we will begin with the relation of listener to environment, cultivating capacities of close listening, description, and recording of sounds in the field. From there we will explore the expressive powers of sound when placed in conversation with, rather than in the service of, the moving image by creating short works of your own design. Topics will include experimental montage, the voice in narrative cinema, the roles of music beyond the soundtrack, microphone techniques, sound editing, basic effects and processing. There will be additional screenings assigned one day per week, schedule to be determined.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0010 (Film and Media Production I, formerly FMS 0030); or instructor permission.\n\nFMS 0094 Solo Dance on Camera.

(Upper level, formerly FMS 0194) An exploration of brands and media as transitional cultural objects that recreate our psychology, perceptions and mythologies just as we create them to further political and economic agendas. We will address the question of how our 21st century culture has changed under the influence of pervasive advertising, public relations, images and narratives that have replaced old belief systems with new, often elusive, definitions of truth, meaning and reality itself. We will tackle the concepts of Marshall McLuhan, who saw the power of media as extending our senses and thereby altering our experience of the world. We will analyze the thought structures of a consumer society through Jean Baudrillard’s system of objects, and better understand how we see the world through John Berger’s ideas on images and perception, as well as Susan Sontag’s analysis of the unique function of photographs in defining real things and events, among others. How all these concepts coalesce and accelerate in the digital world and its fast-evolving social media will frame an analysis of how opinions can be swayed at breakneck speed and blur the edges between fact and fiction in a post-modern environment.\n\nWe will ground these theories in case studies of major brands, non-profits, and issues, including Apple, Inc., Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Subaru, World Wildlife Fund, the American presidency, immigration and others. In this way, we will see how these theories are reflected in current use and if understanding them can create more effective modes of persuasion.\n\nThis course is a deep dive into the environment that produced the concepts and tactics introduced in the Fall semester course FMS 0043, Public Relations and Marketing: A History of Theory and Practice.\n\nPre-requisites: FMS 0032 (PR & Marketing) OR FMS 0033 (Social Marketing); or instructor permission.

Special importance placed on developing musical transcription skills. Specific repertoire ranges extensively, and will be partially determined by student interest. Intended for advanced undergraduates and graduates. Recommendations: Music 112, graduate standing, or permission of instructor.\n\nNon-U.S. Film or Media Courses\n\nFMS 0050 Disney Studios Meets Studio Ghibli. (Cross-listed with JPN 0083 & ILVS 0078) In this course we will be exploring both the fascinating differences and the surprising similarities that these two vastly influential animation studios share. Disney is known for almost a century as exporting a certain kind of American popular culture—optimistic, family-oriented and with easily understandable values of good versus evil. Its overall “message” is supported by the studio’s trademark brightly colored visuals and catchy song and dance numbers. In contrast, Ghibli Studios, along with other Japanese animation, started to catch fire internationally in the late twentieth century and was seen as offering an alternative to Disney’s (and Hollywood’s) “happily ever after” vision. While Ghibli, like Disney, creates immersive fantasy worlds that employ beautiful visuals and emotionally affecting musical scores, the studio’s overall vision is more complex and includes a willingness to tolerate ambiguity and an insistence on going beyond simplistic formulations of good versus evil. At the same time, both studios have important similarities in their brilliant use of animation techniques, their family orientation, broadly moral values system, choice of story and consistent use of the genres of fantasy and science fiction.\n\nFMS majors and minors looking to enroll in this course for Fall 2022 must initially enroll in JPN-0083. After enrollment, students wishing to be enrolled in the FMS course for degree requirements will be switched to FMS section.\n\nThis course counts toward the Humanities distribution requirement.\n\nFMS 0061 French Cinema. (Cross-listed) France is home to one of the richest, most influential national cinemas in film history. This lecture course will examine how French filmmakers helped pioneer the major genres of early cinema in the 1890s; contributed to the development of narrative film in the 1900s and 1910s; and then created alternatives to mainstream cinema in the 1920s such as Impressionism. We will see how they dealt with the coming of sound in the late 1920s, cultivated new \"realist\" styles such as Poetic Realism in the 1930s, and responded to the rise of the Popular Front and the German occupation. We will consider the so-called Tradition of Quality that emerged during and after the occupation; French film noir of the 1950s; the New Wave and the \"Left Bank\" group of the 1960s; political modernism and feminist film of the 1970s; and the \"cinema du look\" and the \"new realism\" of the 1980s and 1990s. Finally, we will examine trends in contemporary French filmmaking, such as the extreme violence that has characterized some French films since the 1990s (the so-called New French Extremity), the cinema de banlieue with its focus on multi-racial working class and marginalized communities on the peripheries of cities, the \"beur\" films of filmmakers of Arab heritage, and LGBTQ+ filmmaking. At all times we will pay careful attention to the historical conditions that gave rise to these trends, as well as the most important debates in French film theory and criticism. There will be two, separate, mandatory screenings per week. In English. No prior study of film nor knowledge of French is required.\n\nFMS 0063 Love and War i"
