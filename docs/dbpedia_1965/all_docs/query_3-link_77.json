        "text": "On 04 March 2018, Sergei Skripal, ex-colonel of the GRU and former British intelligence agent, and his daughter Julia were founcd unconscious in the town of Salisbury and taken to hospital in critical condition. Skripal and his daughter, who arrived from Russia the day before, drove to a shopping center in Salisbury, where they had a drink at a pub and dinner at a restaurant. About a half hour later, emergency personnel were called to assist the two, who were found in \"extremely serious condition\" on a bench near the shopping center. The police officer who was first on the scene also remained hospitalized.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Teresa May immediately stated the main thing: \"The British government considers it very likely that Russia is responsible for the attempt on the life of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia.... Mr. Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent of military origin, developed in Russia. It is known as Novichok [\"Beginner\"],\" the prime minister said, adding that \"the Russian authorities have the experience of eliminating people with the help of poisonous substances... Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so. Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations, and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations, the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal,\" she said. The government was accused of failing to learn from the murder of Litvinenko and the fact that in the case of Skripal, the special services were unable to protect their agent.\n\nVil Mirzayanov, the Russian chemist who helped develop the Soviet-era nerve agent used to poison Skripal and other, insisted only Moscow could be behind the attack. He told Reuters he had no doubt that Mr Putin was responsible, given Russia maintained tight control over its Novichok stockpile.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin reacted to the scandal rather laconically. Vladimir Vladimirovich smirked after BBC journalist Steve Rosenberg asked if Russia was responsible for the attack. \"You'll sort it out there yourself, and then we'll discuss this with you,\" he said in response to a question from the British broadcaster. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on 13 March 2018 that Moscow would not respond to MayÂ’s ultimatum until London provided access to the nerve agent that was allegedly used. \"Russia is not guilty,\" Lavrov said.\n\nThe Skripals were in a critical condition for weeks and doctors at one point feared that, even if they survived, they might have suffered brain damage. But their health began to improve rapidly, and Yulia was discharged in April. Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy who was poisoned by a nerve agent in Britain, was discharged from hospital, England's health service said on 18 May 2018, more than two months after the poisoning event."
