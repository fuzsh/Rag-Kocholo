        "text": "A Russian minister died this weekend of an unknown illness during a flight home to Russia, marking the latest mysterious death of a prominent Russian figure since the start of the Ukraine war.\n\nDeputy Minister of Science and Higher Education Pyotr Kucherenko, 46, died on Saturday as he was returning from a government trip to Cuba, the ministry announced in a brief press release.\n\nKucherenko “became ill on the plane,” the ministry wrote, causing the plane to make an emergency stop in the Russian town of Mineralnye Vody.\n\nThere, “doctors tried to help, but they failed to save” the deputy minister, the release states. No other details were given. The ministry offered condolences to Kucherenko’s friends and family.\n\nAccording to state-run broadcaster Zvezda, Kucherenko’s family believes his death may be related to a heart condition, but an official forensic examination is set to take place on Wednesday. In a Telegram post published shortly after Kucherenko’s death, independent Russian journalist Roman Super shared details of a conversation he had with the deputy minister in early 2022.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSuper fled Russia for security reasons, he claims, which Kucherenko encouraged him to do after Russia invaded Ukraine last February.\n\n“Save yourself and your family. Leave as soon as possible,” Kucherenko allegedly told the journalist. “In a year you won’t recognize Russia at all.”\n\nSuper asked the deputy minister if he planned to flee Russia as well at the outbreak of the war. Kucherenko said it would be impossible for him to leave.\n\n“It is no longer possible to do so. They take away our passports,” the post reads.\n\nKucherenko reportedly added that no country in the world would be willing to take in a Russian deputy minister “after this fascist invasion.”\n\n“I drink antidepressants and tranquilizers at the same time. Handfuls. And it doesn’t help much,” Kucherenko was quoted as saying when asked how he was handling the situation in Russia.\n\nGet breaking National news\n\nFor news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.\n\nSign up for breaking National newsletter\n\nBy providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n\n“I hardly sleep. I feel terrible. We are all taken hostage,” he said. “Nobody can say anything. Otherwise, we are immediately crushed like aphids.”\n\nCNN, citing an investigation by independent outlet IStories, reported that some senior Russia officials tried to quit their posts but were not allowed to. A Russian government spokesperson has dismissed the report as a hoax.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nKucherenko is survived by his wife, pop singer Diana Gurtskaya, and their teenage son.\n\nKucherenko is far from the first Russian elite to meet a mysterious end since the Ukraine war started.
