        "text": "Marina Khlebnikova is a real gem of the Russian stage. Recognition and popularity came to the singer in the early 90s.\n\nToday she has earned the title of not just a popular performer, but an actress and TV presenter.\n\n\"Rains\" and \"A Cup of Coffee\" are compositions that characterize Marina Khlebnikova's repertoire.\n\nIt should be noted that a peculiar feature of the Russian singer was open outfits from designer Sergei Zverev, and an unmeasured amount of accessories with precious stones.\n\nChildhood and youth of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nMarina Khlebnikova was born in 1965 in the town of Dolgoprudny near Moscow. The parents of the future star worked as radio physicists.\n\nBut, the passion for the exact sciences did not prevent Marina's mom and dad from falling in love with music. Mom, for example, enthusiastically played the piano, and dad played the guitar.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova studied very well at school. Especially, the girl was given the exact sciences. Studying in high school, the girl even talked about her dream of becoming a metallurgist.\n\nWhile studying at school, the girl took part in almost all school performances and holidays.\n\n“I am very grateful to my father, who occupied me from an early age. Already at the age of four I was skating, swimming in the pool and skiing. At the age of 5, my mother took me to a ballet school. But, seeing my dirty tights, my mother decided to transfer me to a music school. And so my love with the piano happened, ”recalls Marina Khlebnikova.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova in the Marinade group\n\nYoung Marina Khlebnikova became the founder of the Marinade ensemble.\n\nIn addition to the fact that she took all the organizational moments on her fragile shoulders, Marina was the main vocalist. Khlebnikova covered the famous hits of Soviet and Western performers.\n\nIn addition to certain successes in music, Khlebnikova became a candidate for master of sports in swimming.\n\nIn 1987, she took the honorable 1st place in the city competitions. The future star in her interviews says that the sport tempered and disciplined her.\n\nNow, Marina Khlebnikova does not even dream of becoming a metallurgist. She was deeply involved in music, creativity and art. Despite the fact that the parents really wanted to see their daughter with a serious profession behind her, they support her.\n\nSo, Marina discovers a creative beginning in herself. The only thing left to do is to find your island in the music industry.\n\nThe beginning of the musical career of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nAfter receiving a high school diploma, Marina Khlebnikova submits documents to one of the most prestigious educational institutions in Moscow - the Gnessin School.\n\nThe girl's teachers were such outstanding singers as Iosif Kobzon, Lev Leshchenko and Alexander Gradsky.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Khlebnikova dreams of higher education, so she submits documents to the Gnessin Institute. The girl studied at the pop faculty.\n\nWhile studying at Gnesinka, she was a member of the Dixieland Doctor Jazz. Dean Iosif Kobzon personally handed the graduation diploma to Marina Khlebnikova.\n\nDuring her studies, the girl had a chance to meet Bari Alibasov himself. The producer noted that Marina has good vocal skills.\n\nIn addition, Khlebnikova had a very attractive appearance. Marina becomes a member of the Integral team, and then moves to Na-na.\n\nIn the above Russian groups, she worked in the early 90s. With musicians, she traveled half the countries of the USSR.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova was flattered by the recognition of music lovers, but, of course, the girl dreams of a solo musical career.\n\nFounding single: \"Cocoa Cocoa\"\n\nIn the early 90s, the singer became a laureate of the Yalta 91 contest with the song \"Paradise in a Tent\", in 1992 - a laureate of an international competition in Austria.\n\nIn the same period of time, she writes the most popular musical compositions. We are talking about \"Cocoa Cocoa\", \"I would not say\" and \"Accidental Love\".\n\nIn 1997, on almost all radio stations, the top musical composition from Khlebnikova's repertoire, \"A Cup of Coffee\", was heard. This track brings the singer national love and popularity.\n\nSoon the album of the same name \"A Cup of Coffee\" was released, which took fourth place in terms of sales.\n\nIn the winter of 1998, Khlebnikova gives a performance at the Moscow Palace of Youth.\n\nIn the same 1998, the short film Rains was released. This picture includes as many as 9 musical compositions by Khlebnikova. Fans of the singer's work are happy to meet new hits.\n\nSome of the compositions of the Russian singer were awarded the Golden Gramophone award, Khlebnikova herself wrote the lyrics, and Alexander Zatsepin wrote the music.\n\nDuring these years, the peak of Marina's popularity comes. She breaks a lot of awards that confirm the professionalism of the singer.\n\nAwards and titles of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nThe year 2002 became very significant in the life of Khlebnikova. This year she was awarded the title of Honored Artist of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe singer herself noted this event as follows: “For me, the title of Honored Artist of the Russian Federation is significant. This is a sign that I really benefit our country. This is a recognition of my talent at the highest level.”\n\nIn the musical career of Marina Khlebnikova there are not only solo performances. For example, the singer interacted with the rocker Alexander Ivanov. The musicians recorded the track \"Friends\" together.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Marya the Artisan Khlebnikova was a member of the HZ group.\n\nIt should be noted that Khlebnikova's songs sounded in the Russian TV series \"My Fair Nanny\".\n\nYes, and why hide, Marina herself flashed in the picture, as an actress. Here, however, Marina did not need to transform into someone. In the series, she played herself.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova on radio and television\n\nIn addition, the voice of the Russian singer sounded on the radio. She was a presenter on the radio \"Mayak\" and \"Retro FM\".\n\nMarina also tried herself as a TV presenter. She was casting at the \"Stairway to Heaven\" contest and in the \"Street of Your Destiny\" project.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova never hid the fact that her sincere love for the work she was doing helped her climb to the top of popularity.\n\n“I don’t sing so that this activity brings me profit. First of all, love for your work, and for what you do. Secondly, of course, money. It is foolish to deny the fact that money is dust.”\n\nPersonal life of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nDespite the fact that Khlebnikova is a public figure, she carefully concealed the details of her life from the eyes of strangers. Marina always said “personal is personal. And for good people - beautiful songs performed by me.\n\nBut, from the persistent eyes of journalists, it was still not possible to hide the details of Khlebnikova's personal life.\n\nSo, it is known that the guitarist Anton Loginov became the first husband of the Russian singer. Information has repeatedly appeared in the press that the marriage was fictitious.\n\nBut, despite the guesses of journalists, together with her husband Anton, Marina lived for 10 years. There were no children in the marriage.\n\nLater, Khlebnikova will accuse her husband of treason, and will file for divorce. For Marina, the gap was not something tragic. The singer noted that when she divorced her husband, her mountain just collapsed from her shoulders.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova did not stop at just one trip to the registry office. The second husband of the singer was the general director of Gramophone Records, Mikhail Maidanich. Marina says that this time she married for great love.\n\nIn 1999, a daughter was born in the family. This marriage also could not last long. The fact is that the husband is tired of being in the shadow of his famous wife. He filed for divorce.\n\nDaughter of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nMarina recalls with bitterness this difficult period for herself. After the divorce, Marina had to raise her daughter alone.\n\nDominica was only one month old when her mother took to the big stage. It was necessary for something to feed and dress the baby, so Khlebnikova had no other options.\n\nDominica bears her mother's surname. There was a period when the girl, just like, and her mother tried herself as a singer.\n\nBut, Dominica admitted that scenes are clearly not her path. She went to England, where she decided to become an economist.\n\nInterestingly, after breaking up with her second husband, Marina filed for alimony. But, she did not bring this event to the press, because she was afraid that Mikhail would not want to pay money.\n\nIn her interviews, Khlebnikova always said that she had no problems with money.\n\nTragedies in the fate of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nAfter the divorce, Khlebnikova got a luxurious two-room apartment. Marina made expensive repairs in the room, and invited her first husband Anton to live with her.\n\nLogvinov had recently suffered a stroke, and Khlebnikova considered that in no case should he be left alone. But, the singer was not going to get married.\n\nIn 2018, Khlebnikova discovered the body of her civil husband in a noose. He committed suicide. Anton left a note stating that he does not blame anyone, and takes this step consciously. The body of Khlebnikova's civil husband was cremated at his own request.\n\nMarina was never able to get to Anton's funeral. She had a nervous breakdown and ended up in the hospital. All questions were answered by her close friend. Her mother helped Khlebnikova to recover.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova now\n\nMarina Khlebnikova in 2021 never ceases to amaze fans. In mid-June, there was a presentation of the singer's LP, which was called \"Life\". The record was topped by 10 tracks. Recall that Marina has not released albums for more than 15 years. The release of the previous album took place in 2005.\n\nIn 2021, the documentary film Khlebnikov. The Mystery of the Disappearance. The film showed many facts from the life of the beloved artist.\n\nFire in the apartment of Marina Khlebnikova\n\nOn November 18 of the same year, the media reported that a fire had occurred in the singer's apartment. The apartment caught fire as a result of careless handling of fire. Alas, during the fire, Marina was present in the apartment.\n\nShe was taken to the clinic with 50% body burns. According to doctors, Khlebnikova's face, eyes and respiratory organs were injured. Fans were very worried about the life of the artist, and even announced a fundraiser. Marina's condition remained stable for a long time. She was put into a medically induced coma.\n\nMarina Khlebnikova in 2022\n\nOnly at the end of the year did the celebrity's condition improve. After that, it became known that she was transferred to a regular ward. She came to her senses and could talk. In early 2022, she was discharged from the clinic. Today Khlebnikova's life is not in danger.\n\nAt the end of January, the premiere of the video \"Neva\" took place. Marina commented that the video was filmed in the autumn (before the accident).
