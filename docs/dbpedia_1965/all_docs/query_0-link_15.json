An autopsy is scheduled for May 24th.\n\n⚠️\n\nDied suddenly a few months after journalist Roman Super quoted him as saying \"It’s impossible [for me to leave Russia], they confiscate our passports. And there’s no world that would be happy to see a deputy Russian minister after this fascist invasion. You can’t imagine the degree of brutalization of our country. You won’t even recognize Russia in a year.\"\n\nCargo ID: #781\n\nEnglish Name: Peter Aleksandrovich Kucherenko\n\nRussian Name: Кучеренко Пётр Александрович\n\nDate of Birth: March 3, 1977 (age: 46 years)\n\nPlace of Birth: Dudinka, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia\n\nINN (Tax ID): 504401338920\n\nIncome (2020): ₽8,709,433 ($121,061)\n\nAwards: Kucherenko was awarded the medal of the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, II degree, his rank is a Full State Councilor of the 2nd class.\n\nWife:\n\nEnglish Name: Diana Gudaevna Gurtskaya\n\nRussian Name: Диана Гудаевна Гурцкая\n\nDate of Birth: July 2, 1978\n\nPlace of Birth: Abkhazia (ex-Soviet Georgia)\n\nProfession: Pop Singer\n\nIncome: ₽6,761,182 ($93,980)\n\nIn the early 1990s, her family was forced to endure the miseries of life in a refugee camp, which eventually led them to migrate to Russia.
