She's considered one of the most successful singers in Russia, with eight number one singles (holding the record of most N° 1 singles ever in Russia) and a big popularity in media.\n\nBiography[]\n\n1990–2006: Childhood and adolescence[]\n\nAnna Shurochkina was born on 15 August 1990 into a family of musicians. Her father, Vladimir Shurochkin (born April 12, 1966) was a former member of the musical group Laskoviy May (\"Ласковый май\"). Her mother, Irina Shurochkina sang in a rock band in her youth. When Anna was two years old, her parents divorced. However, the father and his daughter still spent a lot of time together. Nyusha's sister, Maria Shurochkina, was twice European Junior Champion in Synchronised swimming and her brother, Ivan Shurochkin, does Martial Arts Stunts. Nyusha first came to the studio at age 5, with her \"Песенка большой медведицы\" (Pesenka Bolshoy Medveditsy) or in English \"Song of the Great Bear\".\n\nAt age 11 she began performing on stage as the group Grizli. The group toured in Russia and Germany. At age 17 she changed her name from Anna to Nyusha.\n\n2007–2009: Early career[]\n\nIn 2008 Nyusha took seventh place in the international contest \"New Wave 2008\" and also wrote the final song of the heroine in the dubbed version of the film Enchanted.
