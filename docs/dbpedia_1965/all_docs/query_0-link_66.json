But in recent years the virtual ignoring of the Commons by elected officials of the AAA has made the Commons a wasted expense of the AAA. I don't recommend doing away with the Commons. I recommend that each new President of the AAA make it a priority to restore use of the Commons by AAA members. Until this happens we cannot really look to the Commons for \"Emerging Accounting Topics.\"\n\nThe best thing at the moment might be for each school or department of accounting to appoint a liaison subscriber to the AECM Listserv also funded by the AAA.\n\nThat liaison can then send email messages to local accounting faculty and students for AECM messages deemed of possible interest to faculty and students. Hopefully, liaison faculty will also become contributors to the AECM rather than merely lurkers. The quality of AECM messaging should become of concern to all subscribers. As an active contributor to the AECM I would like to become more of a lurker while new subscribers contribute more and more of \"Emerging Accounting Topics\" plus some of those interesting Off Topic topics that generate feedback on the AECM.\n\nhttp://listserv.aaahq.org/cgi-bin/wa.exe?HOME\n\nThe Guardian: Why are so many YouTubers finding themselves stressed, lonely and exhausted? ---\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/08/youtube-stars-burnout-fun-bleak-stressed\n\nJensen Comment\n\nI hesitate to say that this is also a problem for bloggers, but most of the faculty bloggers in accountancy dropped out or greatly slowed down, including some of my favorites like The Grumpy Old Accountants, Accounting Education News, Accountinator, Accounting Cycle, Building Business Value, FraudBytes (nothing for nine months), MyEMBA, Pondering the Classroom, RandomThoughts (nothing in nine months), Really Engaging Accounting, Stephen Lynn's Blog, Stategic Management Accounting, Teaching Managerial Accounting, The Professor's Perspective, The Summa, The TaxDoc Spot, The Trite's E-Business Blog (Jerry still has a Zorba blog), The Accounting Coach, The XBRL Canada Blog, Thinking Outside the Box, Tic Marks, Análise de Balanço, Globaliconta, Ideias Contábeis, and Professor Lopes de Sá. The Accounting Onion is temporarily out of action, but it will probably return when Tom has fewer irons in the fire.\n\nI suspect virtually every other academic discipline had short-lived blogs by faculty who burned out of blogging or ceased blogging for whatever reasons.\n\nThe AECM Listserv is a unique forum where accounting educators (and others) enter into debates as well as add news items. Many of the most active contributors, however, have dropped out such that there are many lurkers and only a few actives. I miss some of the former actives who liked to needle me and egg me on. I also miss some genuine experts who broadened my understanding of the world (like David Fordham) and some who were outrageous (like David Albrecht).\n\nWhat is really disappointing to me is that I can't think of an accounting educator from a prestigious university who blogs. Accountics scientists rarely stick their heads out of the ground. If I'm missing somebody here please let me know! They sometimes contribute working papers to SSRN, but the SSRN has a wall preventing interactive exchanges with authors. It's like they don't want to be bothered by readers.\n\nI really, really miss the Grumpy Old Accountants because they adopted the Abe Briloff (Barrons) style of criticizing published financial statements. I also miss Accounting Education News that kept me up to date on happenings on the other side of the pond.\n\nBritish politician pledges to break up 'cartel' of big four accounting firms in radical overhaul ---\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/british-politician-pledges-to-break-up-cartel-of-big-four-accounting-firms-in-radical-overhaul-2018-9\n\nHow much does Deloitte depend upon auditing and assurance services revenues (even though most of us knew consulting brings in more revenue, we probably did not know how auditing/assurance stacks up against other revenue sources)?\n\nWhat service revenues are second to consulting?\n\nhttps://goingconcern.com/deloitte-2018-global-revenue/\n\nBeware of revenue growth rates by global regions.

For example, when the academic requirement to sit for the CPA exam was increased to 150 credits many students would've ceased majoring in accounting if the largest CPA firms and many other companies had not added a modest (often only six week) internship option to lure students back into the fold. Students in general really are attracted to internships. For some it's their first exposure to the professional world of working. These internships contribute a small amount to cover the cost of an extra year or more in college.\n\nI worked part-time for Ernst & Ernst in Denver (now Ernst & Young) three years while earning BS and MBA degrees. Although I'd also worked various jobs over eight years before that (as well as farm work as a small child) my E&E job was the first time I wore a white shirt and tie to work under what was then E&E's very strict dress and professional behavior code.\n\nOne huge problem with experiential learning is that the learning content can be highly variable and hard to control in a curriculum plan. Most colleges insist that internships be more than low-level (think clerical) activities. But that's not saying much about a curriculum plan. Some universities require that student write papers about their experiences. But it's almost impossible to evaluate those feedbacks for grading purposes.\n\nExtensive experiential learning can really cut into hoped for content in a curriculum plan. It's really, really hard to obtain consistency over what different students learn in different assignments. And in many, many instances students can't be blamed when the learning component of their \"jobs\" falls apart for reasons beyond their control.\n\nA record $6.2 billion settlement wont be enough to end Visa and Mastercards long-running feud with the U.S.s biggest retailers ---\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-18/visa-mastercard-reach-6-2-billion-settlement-over-swipe-fees\n\nTheres a separate class of merchants fighting for changes to Visa and Mastercards business practices.\n\nStates deregulatory push threatens CPA licensure ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2018/sep/deregulatory-push-threatens-cpa-licensure-201819465.html?utm_source=mnl:cpald&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=10Sep2018\n\nEnormous amounts of food are wasted during manufacturing  here's where it occur\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2018-09-enormous-amounts-food.html\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis may be a cost that accountants are ignoring by looking at llocated incurred costs rather than opportunity values.\n\nMany students aren't aware of the variety of opportunities that come with an accounting degree and a CPA credential ---\n\nhttp://blog.aicpa.org/2018/09/schools-in-inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cpas.html#sthash.6W4HzqqO.dpbs\n\nCPA Journal: Mixing Old and New Teaching Methods to Get Better Student Results ---\n\nhttps://www.cpajournal.com/2018/09/14/mixing-old-and-new-teaching-methods-to-get-better-student-results/\n\nPrint Edition of The Economist for slightly less $1 Per Issue (weekly issues)\n\nMessage from an AECM subscriber (Professor Ethan Kinory at Rutgers)\n\nI've maintained a subscription to The Economist for over 4 years using Discountmags.com, and I've always managed to renew at $51!\n\nhttps://www.discountmags.com/magazine/the-economist?offer=ETSPECIAL\n\nOne potential deal breaker is that this is a print-only subscription.

I currently pay much more for the print edition and electronic access.\n\nYou might want to look for other good deals as well from Discountmags.com\n\nThis might make an interesting case study of pricing decisions in a cost/managerial accounting course. I doubt that with mailing expenses the $1 per issue contributes much, if anything, to recovery of expenses of printing each issue. Where is the publisher recovering fixed costs in this instance? Why is the publisher selling print issues so cheap to discount seeking customers? This may be CPV analysis in the extreme. I could see this happening with high-volume magazines, but The Economist is not Sports Illustrated.\n\nSome large city newspaper publishers have dropped print editions. I recently read that Philadelphia no longer has printed daily newspapers. The daily editions are now only available online.\n\nStanford University: A study finds that companies have come up with a new variant on backdating stock options to reap windfall profits--\n\nClick Here\n\nA Comprehensive Approach To Law School Access Admissions ---\n\nhttp://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2018/08/a-comprehensive-approach-to-law-school-access-admissions.html\n\nShameful: Lack of Diversity in the CPA Profession ---\n\nhttps://cpatrendlines.com/2010/03/02/shameful-lack-of-diversity-in-the-cpa-profession/\n\nJensen Comment\n\nStatistics on diversity in the \"CPA Profession\" can be very misleading. Firstly, the \"CPA Profession\" is only a part, not even a majority part, of the total accounting profession. Passing the CPA examination and obtaining the experience requirements to become a CPA are not required for many, many types of accounting jobs. Accounting careers are highly varied in both the public and private sectors. Secondly, those minority college graduates who do become CPAs face tremendous opportunities to leave the public accounting profession. Sometimes clients will offer almost whatever it takes to lure minority CPA's away from the CPA firms.\n\nMy point here is that there should not be a knee-jerk reaction that the enormous shortage of minority partners in CPA firms is ipso facto evidence of negative prejudice. Firstly, very few CPA firm recruits (white and minority) ever expect or even want to become CPA firm partners. Many of those recruits start out in CPA firms for the training, experience, and the fact that it's often easier to land the first job in a CPA firm for whites and minorities provided they have good grades. Many, however, cannot or otherwise do not pass the CPA examination. Others pass the CPA examination but really never want to become partners due the many negatives about becoming a CPA firm partner, including lots of out-of-town travel, expectations of bringing in new clients and keeping existing clients happy, stress of job performance such as missing something really important in an client's audit or a client's tax return or a client's accounting system.\n\nRetaining African Americans in the Accounting Profession---\n\nhttps://4f2bur4nuye2cgakm2rm61qk-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Howard-U-Retaining-African-Americans-In-Accounting-Profession.pdf ---\n\nInsider Tradings Odd Couple: The Goldman Banker and the NFL Linebacker ---\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-09-28/insider-trading-s-odd-couple-the-goldman-banker-and-the-nfl-linebacker?mbid=nl_hps_5bae9ed7e5ae6a094d00191c&CNDID=31837029\n\nHow to Avoid Becoming a Scam Victim ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2018/sep/avoid-becoming-a-scam-victim.html?utm_source=mnl:cpald&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=27Sep2018\n\nThose Phony IRS Scams Threatening to Put You in Jail\n\nNew technologies aided a massive phone scam, but investigators turned the tables on the scheme, which allegedly caused hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer losses ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2018/sep/tigta-irs-impersonation-scam.html?utm_source=mnl:globalcpa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=12Sep2018\n\nBob Jensen's Fraud Updates ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/FraudUpdates.htm\n\nThe Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by a quarter-point to a target range of 2% to 2.25%, marking the third increase this year ---\n\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/fed-raises-rates-and-says-more-coming-brushing-off-trump-jabs\n\nMortgage rates rose to their highest levels in seven years ---\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-27/u-s-mortgage-rates-rise-to-the-highest-in-more-than-seven-years?cmpid=BBD092718_BIZ&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=180927&utm_campaign=bloombergdaily\n\nReport: New York sitting on a debt bomb ---\n\nhttps://www.statedatalab.org/news/detail/report-new-york-sitting-on-a-debt-bomb\n\nThe CEO of Denmark's biggest bank is out after a $235 billion money laundering scandal ---\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/danske-bank-ceo-resigns-estonian-money-laundering-scandal-2018-9\n\nTax Court: Payment on Ex-Spouses Student Debt is Alimony ---\n\nhttps://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/tax-court-payment-on-ex-spouses-student-debt-is-alimony?source=ei092618\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThat's consistent with taxing student debt payments by employers as compensation --- something that's increasingly common in this labor-shortage economy.\n\nExecutor --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor\n\nPower of Attorney --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney\n\nWhy You Should Pick the Executor of Your Will Carefully  Part Two ---\n\nhttps://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/why-you-should-pick-the-executor-of-your-will-carefully-part-two?source=ei092618\n\nJensen Comment\n\nActually I think it's much, much more important to be careful choosing the law firm handling the estate. It's quite common for the law firm handling the estate be the same one as the firm that made out the will. But there are exceptions where the will was made out in a state different from the state of residence at the time of death. It's easier in most cases to have a new will made out for people that move out of state.\n\nWhen my father died five years after the death of my mother the law firm took care of almost everything for both estates, including filing the income taxes for the estates. As the only child and executor of my dad's will my job was almost entirely clerical --- that of paying bills of the estate. The law firm gave me great instructions on how to handle everything. When there are multiple heirs, choosing the executor becomes more important because there's some opportunity for fraud and error, as is usually the case for anyone hold a power of attorney. My job was a bit easier since I was the only heir and my parents both lived their entire lives in Iowa.\n\nSeveral years after I sold the Iowa farm that I inherited the Iowa Department of Revenue sent me a somewhat threatening letter challenging me on how the farm was valued at the time of death for tax purposes. However, when I told them who the Iowa law firm was that handled the estate valuation and tax returns it put an end to all questions about the valuation and tax filings. That law firm apparently had a wonderful (or perhaps scary) reputation with the tax authorities.\n\nNBA star Zaza Pachulia's former Wisconsin accountant charged with tax fraud ---\n\nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/08/27/nba-star-zaza-pachulias-wisconsin-accountant-charged-tax-fraud/1087592002/\n\nBob Jensen's Fraud Updates --- http://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/FraudUpdates.htm\n\nWho says that public sector accounting is more transparent than private sector accounting?\n\nWhy is public employee disability claim data being kept secret? ---\n\nhttps://www.statedatalab.org/news/detail/why-is-public-employee-disability-claim-data-being-kept-secret\n\nGASB clarifies majority equity interest reporting rules ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2018/sep/gasb-reporting-rules-majority-equity-interest-201819637.html?utm_source=mnl:cpald&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=05Sep2018\n\nTesla's chief accountant quits after one month on the job ---\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-chief-accountant-resigns-2018-9-1027517271\n\nJensen Comment\n\nW'e'll probably never know if he found some of the buried bodies.\n\nNYT: The Empty Storefronts of New York ---\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/06/nyregion/nyc-storefront-vacancy.html\n\nIllinois is better off bankrupt ---\n\nhttps://www.statedatalab.org/news/detail/illinois-is-better-off-bankrupt-3\n\nThe Atlantic: New Trade Deal Shows How Trump Is Getting His Way ---\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/trump-nafta-canada/571795/\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on October 1, 2018\n\nGood day. Executives at companies operating in Canada under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement can breathe a sigh of relief. The U.S. and Canada reached a dramatic, last-minute deal on Sunday to revise the trade pact, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nAt last, a deal: The pending agreement will allow Canada to join an accord reached in late August between the U.S. and Mexico and diminishes the prospects for President Trump to follow through on his threats either to kill Nafta outright or to break the trilateral pact into separate pieces.\n\nNafta 2.0: The new accord, to be officially called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement makes significant changes to the rulebook that has governed continental commerce since 1994. The biggest impact is expected to be on the regions largest industry, autos, requiring a greater portion of vehicles to be made in North America and with high-wage labor in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nA new set of rules: The new deal for the first time sets rules for financial-services and digital businesses that have emerged since the bloc was created, aimed at pleasing sectors from drugmakers to Wall Street.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nI hope the politically warring does not come along intent on destroying the accord for political gains.\n\nTesla shares are getting clobbered after the SEC sues Elon Musk (TSLA) ---\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-elon-musk-sued-by-the-sec-2018-9-1027574392\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 27, 2018\n\nGood day. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk for securities fraud and sought to remove him from the company over allegedly false and misleading tweets. The move highlights the risks companies face in an era of informal, immediate social media discourse.\n\nCritical words: The SEC's complaint lays out Mr. Musk's discussions with representatives of a sovereign investment fund that precipitated the tweets. The complaint identified four critical statements the SEC says are false.\n\nThe most significant of these is just the two-word sentence fragment funding secured, Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman, told CFO Journal's Tatyana Shumsky. When you say funding is secured that means whatever the agreement is, you have the right to call upon the financing that you've arranged.\n\nNot everything goes: The SECs complaint also alleges that Mr. Musk did not follow the procedures and due diligence expected of companies prior to making a big announcement. It is unclear whether Mr. Musk canvassed investors for their support of the deal or sought the approval of Tesla's independent directors, said Mr. Pitt. Mr. Musk called the suit unjustified.\n\nYou cant just say, 'We're going to offer everybody $420 a share and it's all done except for the shareholder vote,' \" said Mr. Pitt, who is CEO and managing director of Kalorama Partners LLC. \"That is not the way the real world works.\n\nElon Musk settles fraud charges with SEC for infamous 'funding secured' tweet, must step down as Tesla chairman and pay $20 million fine (plus another $20 million for the company) ---\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-elon-musk-settles-with-sec-must-step-down-as-chairman-2018-9\n\nJensen Editorial\n\nI don't think there's any serious analyst that seriously believes Elon Musk was intent on turning Tesla over to oil-producing Saudi Arabia. Any serious analyst must realize that Musk intended only to manipulate Tesla's stock prices for the purpose of punishing short sellers. Such CEO manipulation of his or her company's share prices is clearly illegal, and there's no reason Musk should not have been punished like any other CEO. The irony is that after the SEC lawsuit short sellers made billions.\n\nIt's a little like the recent Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia being ejected from game, two innings shy of $500G bonus. No serious baseball analyst seriously denies that Sabathia intentially struck the batter with a 90+ mile an hour fast ball. In fact Sabathia later confessed that it was on purpose ---\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/sports/yankees-pitcher-cc-sabathia-ejected-from-game-two-innings-shy-of-500g-bonus\n\nI doubt that Elon Musk will ever confess to intentionally manipulating Tesla stock prices, but it's a wink wink denial that seemingly cost him plenty but was small change to this billionaire. It may hurt to lose the chairmanship of the Tesla board. But Musk is still the all-important CEO of Tesla and his other corporations.\n\nThe CPA Journal: The 2018 Guidance for Goodwill Impairment ---\n\nhttps://www.cpajournal.com/2018/09/26/the-new-guidance-for-goodwill-impairment/\n\nKPMGs Unusual Twist\n\nWhile KPMG's strategy isn't uncommon among corporations with lots of units in different states, the accounting firm offered an unusual twist: Under KPMG's direction, WorldCom treated \"foresight of top management\" as an intangible asset akin to patents or trademarks.\n\nSee http://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/FraudEnron.htm#WorldcomFraud\n\nBob Jensen's threads on goodwill and other asset impairment issues ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory02.htm#Impairment\n\nCPA Journal: A Positive Look at Accounting Education ---\n\nhttps://www.cpajournal.com/2018/09/20/icymi-a-positive-look-at-accounting-education/\n\nAcademic Accounting (Accountics) Research: A Negative Look at Accounting Research (What Went Wrong?) ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory01.htm#WhatWentWrong\n\nKleiman: Low-End Regressivity ---\n\nhttp://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2018/09/kleiman-.html\n\nEngler: Goodwill Hunting Gone Bad  Tax Law's Outmoded Treatment Of Goodwill\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3051265\n\nGoodwill reflects the positive consumer association with a business. Goodwill thus overlaps with trademarks and other related assets. This close association impedes the separation of goodwill value from such related assets. Difficulties thus arise when the tax law treats goodwill more (or less) favorably than related intangible assets.\n\nFor instance, the tax law previously denied any depreciation deductions for goodwill. Business buyers thus often allocated their costs away from goodwill and towards related assets like depreciable customer lists. The IRS responded with the initial goodwill hunting wave, challenging taxpayers low goodwill valuations. Congress addressed this litigious area in 1993 with new, matching depreciation rules for purchased goodwill and related intangible assets.\n\nBut the goodwill hunting problem remains, albeit with reversed roles, due to other provisions which treat goodwill more favorably than other intangibles. Taxpayers now overstate goodwill with the government in defense against this second goodwill hunting wave. For instance, U.S. corporations inflate goodwill on transfers to foreign subsidiaries given a special gain avoidance rule on such transfers for goodwill. While recent regulations have lessened these particular attempts, the Treasury Departments limited authority prevented a full response for these subsidiary transfers. In addition, similar inconsistent tax rules incentivize high goodwill claims by taxpayers to obtain either more favorable capital gains rates or better foreign tax credit usage.\n\nThis Article proposes four precise fixes to counteract these negative goodwill manipulations. These changes efficiently draw upon existing tax provisions. Such utilization of tried and tested provisions counteracts the status quo bias against untested reform proposals. These four changes together forge a common theme: the pressing need for a more uniform tax treatment of goodwill and other closely-related intangibles. With these changes, Congress would restore the positive association of goodwill back to the tax law.\n\nContinued in article\n\nTax: Recent Developments in Individual Taxation ---\n\nhttps://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2018/sep/recent-developments-individual-taxation.html?utm_source=mnl:cpald&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=11Sep2018\n\nAmazon plants fake packages in delivery trucks as part of an undercover ploy to 'trap' drivers stealing ---\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-sets-traps-for-drivers-2018-9\n\nGOP Tax Law Properly Taxes Churches On Free Parking/Mass Transit Provided To Their Employees ---\n\nhttp://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2018/09/zelinsky-gop-tax-law-properly-taxes-churches-on-free-parkingmass-transit-provided-to-their-employees.html\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis can also hit colleges that provide free campus parking to employees. However, I assume that the \"worth\" of free employee parking is taxable. If surrounding businesses also provide free parking to employees and the public at large the financial worth is fairly low.\n\nAlso subsidies must be considered. If a college in a highly congested area provides employee parking for $100 per year the \"worth\" of that parking may be much higher than $100 per year. At the same time free parking at our local church in these mountains is virtually zero since nearby public parking is always available and always free. There's only one store in Sugar Hill and it only has two part-time employees.\n\nThere's also a question of whether to tax a store owner? If the store employees are taxed for free parking should the owner also be taxed even when she's parking on her own land? Also is there a residency exemption if the owner lives above the store?\n\nWorth can be difficult to measure. Our favorite hotel (a Holiday Inn) near the Harvard Medical School charges $15 per day for parking (at least that was the charge when we stayed there some years back). At the same time the Marriott Hotel a few blocks away charged $35 per day. I think employees at both hotels were given free parking (I don't now if there were free mass transit benefits). Presumably employees of both hotels would now be taxed for free parking, but would Marriott Employees be taxed more than Holiday Inn employees?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Ranks the Top USA Colleges ---\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/news/collection/college-rankings-2019-714fd054?mod=djcm_engmt_cr19_em&mi_u=711942031\n\nJensen Comment\n\nYears ago the WSJ differed from other media outlets that ranked colleges by focusing more on opinions of recruiters that hired graduates. Recruiters sometimes sought out the \"best buys\" in the sense of finding respected colleges whose graduates were somewhat easier to hire with somewhat lesser deals than it takes to get a Harvard MBA graduate. This appears to no longer be the case, although the WSJ is somewhat vague about what sets its rankings apart. It appears that \"value for the money\" is a major criterion. This leads to some bias toward state-supported universities, but not entirely with Harvard and Stanford in the Top 10 in terms of Value for the Money. The small Barea College (Christian in heritage) takes top honors on this criterion --- where students work to get free tuition, room, and board to supplement their scholarships. The accounting program appears to be unique in that, with four-credit courses, students can complete the program in virtually eight semesters. Most universities have three credit courses and take five or more years to complete the 150-credit requirement to sit for the CPA exam ---\n\nhttp://catalog.berea.edu/en/Current/Catalog/Departments-of-Study/Economics-and-Business/Public-Accounting-Option\n\nGovernments Default on Debt More than You Think ---\n\nhttps://mises.org/wire/governments-default-debt-more-you-think\n\nBlockchain --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\n\nUS Navy Launches Blockchain Research in Mission to Improve Tracking System (for lifetime of each major part) ---\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/us-navy-launches-blockchain-research-in-mission-to-improve-tracking-system/\n\nLawmaker plans 3 bills on blockchain development ---\n\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/us-congressman-drafts-blockchain-development-bills/\n\nThe required step before AI and blockchain ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/newsletters/2018/sep/required-step-ai-blockchain.html?utm_source=mnl:cpald&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20Sep2018\n\nHow financial institutions are using distributed ledgers & blockchain technology to transform businesses in 2018 ---\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/beyond-bitcoin-report-2018-3\n\nCryptocurrency --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin, the Regression Theorem, and the Emergence of a New Medium of Exchange ---\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/bitcoin-regression-theorem-and-emergence-new-medium-exchange\n\nJim Borden: I Dont Get Bitcoin  but This Video Explains It Really Well ---\n\nhttps://www.jborden.com/i-dont-get-bitcoin-but-this-video-explains-it-really-well/\n\nCPAs top 5 questions about blockchain, cryptocurrencies ---\n\nhttps://www.journalofaccountancy.com/newsletters/2018/jul/5-questions-blockchain-cryptocurrencies.html?utm_source=mnl:globalcpa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=26Sep2018\n\nWhat Will Cryptocurrency Be Like in 10 Years?

But it does bring to mind, for me at least, those very notable changes in financial reporting systems since the 1940s era of Paton and Littleton's historical cost reporting. For example, there were controversial precursors of exit value reporting, most notably MacNeal's Truth in Accounting book in 1939. This is not what I have in mind for the \"Night Watch\" NW analogy. But what I do have in mind is the FAS 115 standard that eventually required exit value reporting for marketable securities in financial reporting --- a significant departure from historical cost reporting. Then there's John Canning's 1929 thesis Economics of Accountancy that was a precursor to FAS 33 on current (replacement cost) accountancy. The NW analogy is FAS 33 that set current cost accounting into motion (at least for about five years before being abandoned). It's not that FAS 33 and FAS 115 were \"masterpieces.\" But they set significant things into motion much like Rembrandt's Night Watch.\n\nThere are various other examples of NW motion setting such as FAS 106, FAS 123R, FAS 133, and other illustrations that weren't exactly complete paradigm shifts but were happenings that set important things into motion for financial reporting to date. The test of a NW analogy is that the change results in significant differences in financial reporting numbers and financial decisions of companies (although FAS 33 did not impact such decisions like some of the other NW analogies like FAS 106, FAS 123R, and FAS 133).\n\nEY: SEC Comments and trends publications and webcast ---\n\nhttps://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssetsAL/SECCommentsTrends_04321-181US_24September2018/$FILE/SECCommentsTrends_04321-181US_24September2018.pdf\n\nOur 2018 SEC Comments and Trends  An analysis of current reporting issues publication and its companion SEC Reporting Update publication, 2018 trends in SEC comment letters, explain what the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is focusing on in its comments. The publications also provide best practices for responding to comment letters and will help you plan for the year-end reporting season.\n\nIn our SEC Comments and Trends publication, we discuss in detail the SEC staffs focus areas in its reviews of public filings during the year ended 30 June 2018. Our publication notes the ongoing decline in the number of comment letters issued by the SEC staff and identifies the top comment areas by industry.\n\nOur SEC Reporting Update publication points out areas of focus of comment letters issued to early adopters of the new revenue standard, which may indicate areas the SEC staff will focus on when reviewing filings by the much larger population of registrants that adopted the standard in 2018. It also highlights areas the SEC staff may focus on next, such as disclosures about cybersecurity and how companies will be affected by new accounting standards on leases and credit impairment, and their completion of accounting for the effects of income tax reform.\n\nEY: How the new leases standard affects engineering and construction entities ---\n\nhttps://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssetsAL/TechnicalLine_04349-181US_ECLeases_20September2018/$FILE/TechnicalLine_04349-181US_ECLeases_20September2018.pdf\n\nEY: New SEC interim reporting requirement to reconcile changes in stockholders equity ---\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2018/33-10532.pdf\n\nRegistrants will have to consider whether they will need to expand their disclosures to comply with the SECs Disclosure Update and Simplification release (DUSTR) adopted in August. While most of the amendments eliminate outdated or duplicative disclosure requirements, the final rule amends the interim financial statement requirements to require a reconciliation of changes in stockholders equity in the notes or as a separate statement. This analysis should reconcile the beginning balance to the ending balance of each caption in stockholders equity for each period for which an income statement is required to be filed and comply with the remaining content requirements of Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X. As a result, registrants will have to provide the reconciliation for both the year-to-date and quarterly periods and comparable periods in Form 10-Q but only for the year-to-date periods in registration statements.\n\nThe rule does not prescribe the format of the presentation as long as the appropriate periods are provided. Examples of presentations that would be acceptable include:\n\nA single statement/presentation that reconciles the components and total of shareholders equity from the prior year-end to the balances/subtotals at the end of the first quarter and continuing the reconciliation to the balances/subtotals at the end of each succeeding quarter with comparative reconciliations for the prior year periods\n\nOne statement/presentation that reconciles those components and the total for both the year-to-date period and comparable prior year period and a second statement/presentation that reconciles the beginning and ending balances/subtotals for both the quarterly period and comparable period\n\nDUSTR will be effective 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register. If the rule is published in the Federal Register more than 30 days before the due date of the 30 September Form 10-Q, it is possible that the reconciliation could be required in those financial statements. The SEC staff is expected to clarify whether the effective date is based upon the filing date or balance sheet date (in which case it would not be effective for calendar year-end third quarters).\n\nEY: Comment letter on the PCAOB Draft Strategic Plan for 2018-2022\n\n. . .\n\nGeneral views on the Draft Plan\n\nWe commend the Boards forward-looking approach in the Draft Plan as we all grapple with the fastmoving business environment and technological disruption. Adjusting to the dynamic environment is critical for the PCAOB, the profession and all of the PCAOBs stakeholders. The pace and nature of change and auditors increasing ability to review and utilize significant amounts of data present new risks as well as tremendous opportunities to enhance the value of the audit to investors and others.\n\nThe PCAOBs Draft Plan outlines important and sensible goals and objectives that we believe will focus PCAOB actions on promoting higher levels of audit quality and protecting investors in todays fluid environment. The plan identifies several important risks to audit oversight and also recognizes the extensive opportunities for the PCAOB and its various stakeholders  including firms, audit committees, preparers, investors and academics  to work together to advance audit quality and investor protection.\n\nWe have identified certain areas of the Draft Plan that we believe merit further discussion, given their importance to audit quality and effective oversight. Below, we provide some additional comments and suggestions for the Boards consideration in three areas: evolution of PCAOB reporting to drive audit quality improvements; meeting the challenge of the evolving technological landscape; and stakeholder engagement and communication. We also refer the Board to the comment letter on the Draft Plan from the Center for Audit Quality (CAQ), which identifies additional areas for consideration. We look forward to engaging with the PCAOB along with other stakeholders to advance the implementation of the Strategic Plan.\n\nEvolution of PCAOB reporting to drive audit quality improvements\n\nWe welcome the PCAOBs objective of reporting on inspection activities to provide more timely and relevant feedback,3 as we believe the PCAOB has the opportunity to advance audit quality through its publicly issued reports on inspection findings. We agree that enhanced reporting could help firms prevent and remediate deficiencies. We believe it also should give other consumers of the reports information that can be more readily understood and used. Today, most of what is reported is\n\nContinued in article\n\nEY: FASB issues guidance on accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements ---\n\nhttps://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssetsAL/TechnicalLine_04271-181US_CloudComputing_6September2018/$FILE/TechnicalLine_04271-181US_CloudComputing_6September2018.pdf\n\nWhat you need to know\n\n The FASB issued new guidance requiring a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. This may be a change in practice for some entities.\n\n Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use.\n\n The guidance is effective for calendar-year public business entities in 2020. For all other calendar-year entities, it is effective for annual periods beginning in 2021 and interim periods in 2022. Early adoption is permitted.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB or Board) issued final guidance1 requiring a customer in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract to follow the internaluse software guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-402 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets. The Board said its intent was to reduce potential diversity in practice in accounting for the costs of implementing cloud computing arrangements (i.e., hosting arrangements) that are service contracts. Stakeholders had asked the Board to address this issue after it amended ASC 35040 in 2015 to include guidance on how to evaluate whether a hosting arrangement includes an internal-use software license.\n\nSee if your favorite news outlet reports that Amazon raised its minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour --- many news outlets will cherry pick this item to ignore\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on October 2, 2018\n\nGood day. Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday said it was raising the minimum wage it pays all U.S. workers to $15 an hour, a move that could dial up pressure on other retailers to hike pay and benefits for their employees, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nMoney, money, money: Amazon's new minimum wage will kick in Nov. 1, covering more than 250,000 current employees and 100,000 seasonal holiday employees. The company said it also will start lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour.\n\nWill others follow? Amazon's move comes as only a fraction of U.S. companies are redirecting savings from the tax-code overhaul into employees' wallets. A new survey of 152 companies by executive-recruitment firm Korn Ferry International revealed 14% were funneling part of their tax-cut savings into base salary increases. A poll of 1,500 companies by consulting firm Mercer LLC showed only 4% are redirecting tax savings to budgets for bigger paychecks.\n\nCost concerns: Companies are reluctant to grant higher-than-usual pay raises in part because it adds to their fixed labor costs, compensation experts said. Theyre doing everything they can to avoid seeing their permanent payroll go up, said Bill Ravenscroft, senior vice president at Adecco Group AG, which recruits workers for companies.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nIt's so much harder for small businesses (I think of our struggling and tiny Franconia Hardware Store and our small Bed and Breakfast hotels that really struggle seasonally) to pay $15 and offer the same fringe benefits as Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, and the other worldwide giants. Starbucks and Walmart even offer free college tuition.\n\nTim Berners-Lee has a plan to fix the web (who did not invent the Internet in the 1960s but did invent the web 20 years later) ---\n\nhttps://medium.com/@timberners_lee/one-small-step-for-the-web-87f92217d085\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThis seems to be a little far-fetched to me. If I'm buying products (or services) from Amazon on a weekly basis it's inconceivable that Amazon cannot easily know my buying habits. Amazon has to keep track of my history of orders for a variety of legitimate reasons such as for purposes of verifying my refund requests. Also Amazon cannot be paid by my credit card unless I give them my credit card number. Laws can be passed to prevent Amazon from sharing my buying information with outsiders. However, laws should not be passed to keep Amazon from knowing my buying information or from fining Amazon if hackers manage to steal my information from Amazon.\n\nDoes anybody else see the moral hazard in this EU privacy law?\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on October 1, 2018\n\nA European Union privacy watchdog could fine Facebook Inc. as much as $1.63 billion for a data breach announced Friday in which hackers compromised the accounts of more than 50 million users, if regulators find the company violated the blocs strict new privacy law.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nIt's a little like making a law where the government fines a bank billions just because it got robbed.

Beijing is increasingly deploying an array of tactics to pry intellectual propertysometimes coercivelyfrom U.S. companies in a phenomenon that is central to the trade fight between the two countries, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTool set: Chinas methods include pressuring U.S. partners in joint ventures to relinquish technology, using local courts to invalidate American firms patents and licensing arrangements, dispatching antitrust and other investigators, and filling regulatory panels with experts who may pass trade secrets to Chinese competitors.\n\nWidespread issue: About one in five members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai say they have been pressured to transfer technology, according to a survey conducted in the spring. Of those companies, 44% in aerospace and 41% in chemicals report notable pressure. China considers both industries strategically important.\n\nCostly brinkmanship: As Washington turns up the tariffs threats on Beijing to influence China's stance on intellectual property, the stakes are also rising for the broader economy. The U.S. economy could shrink about 2% in the first year of a trade war with the rest of the world, while China and other economies could gain, according to new research published Wednesday by the European Central Bank.\n\nChina also faces risks: The longer tariffs remain in place, the more multinationals that want to sell to the U.S. will seek alternatives to China to source production. Taiwan and Thailand are already marketing themselves as alternatives, the WSJs Greg Ip reports.\n\nCookie Jar Accounting --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_jar_accounting\n\nCookie Jar Accounting Fraud Conviction\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 26, 2018\n\nGood day. The former chief financial officer of Bankrate Inc., the financial services and marketing company, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for securities and accounting fraud that resulted in $25 million in shareholder losses, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday.\n\nGuilty plea: Edward DiMaria, 53 years old, pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to make false statements to the companys accountants, falsify the companys books, records and accounts, and commit securities fraud, as well as one count of making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCookie jar: Mr. DiMaria admitted to conspiring and directing a scheme to artificially inflate Bankrates earnings through cookie jar or cushion accounting, a practice in which a company keeps a large quantity of reserves from an economically successful year on its books to boost its earnings results, while incurring them against losses during weaker quarters.\n\nPay it back: Mr. DiMaria was also ordered to pay restitution of $21.2 million to Bankrates shareholders. The significant sentence handed down today underscores the serious nature of corporate fraud and the damage it causes to shareholders and to the publics trust in our financial markets, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said in a statement.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 25, 2018\n\nLarge merchants including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. are pushing the right to reject some rewards credit cards in a move that's likely to upset some consumers.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 25, 2018\n\nMultinational companies, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the Internal Revenue Service is incorrectly denying them refunds on their 2017 tax returns.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 24, 2018\n\nThe gap between the price of a new and used vehicle is as wide as it has been in years, pushing an increasing number of U.S. consumers to the used-car lot and putting pressure on auto makers to deepen discounts on new cars to keep them competitive.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThe gap will probably get wider as interest rates increase both leasing and car loan rates.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 24, 2018\n\nGermany, one of the worlds main maritime players, saw its commercial fleet shrink by a third over the past six years, becoming the biggest loser in a vicious industry slump that has reshaped global shipping.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThe purported maritime slump surprised me in these supposed boom times before tariffs kick in to possibly reduce ocean shipping.\n\nStock Buybacks Lift Earnings\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 24, 2018\n\nGood day. Last Decembers U.S. tax overhaul is boosting corporate profits, helping companies fund record stock buybacks -- a move that makes their results look better by raising the per-share earnings they highlight for investors, The Wall Street Journal's Michael Rapoport and Theo Francis report.\n\nA new record: S&P 500 companies bought back $189 billion of their own shares in the first quarter, and a similar number -- if not more -- is expected for the second quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. By contrast, S&P 500 buybacks totaled no more than $137 billion in any of the six quarters before the tax overhaul.\n\nSome firms are more aggressive than others: Apple Inc. repurchased 112.8 million shares in the quarter that ended in June, contributing 5 cents to its earnings of $2.34 a share. Union Pacific Corp. repurchased about 4% of its shares in the second quarter, helping earnings per share climb substantially faster than net income. Thanks to buybacks, Southwest Airlines Co.s quarterly per-share earnings rose even though its profit fell from a year earlier.\n\nGiving back to shareholders: The buybacks arent necessarily done for the purpose of increasing per-share earnings. Many companies say they want to return excess capital to shareholders. Others intend to offset new shares issued to employees as compensation. But the benefits to per-share earnings from buybacks can help a companys result compare more favorably to Wall Street forecasts.\n\nDo you know what a Ruku device will do?\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 21, 2018\n\nESPN said it has signed up more than 1 million paying subscribers for the streaming service it launched in April, a boost of confidencefor majority-owner Walt Disney Co.s effort to win over cable TV cord-cutters.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nOur cable company, Spectrum, bought out Time Warner cable. For about a year things remained pretty much the same. Now Spectrum, that has the cable monopoly in our region, is commencing to behave more like a monopoly. On October 9, 2018 it's shifting to all digital. In the fine print this entails having to pay extra to rent (by the month) a cable box that was not a necessary item needed under Time Warner. Also Spectrum pulled some of the most popular channels out of the basic package and mixed them with a bunch of junk channels. For example, I like the commercial-free American Movie Classics channel that plays older movies. This has been a free channel for as long as I can remember. Now in order to get AMC I have to pay $20 per month extra for it and 174 junk channels that I will never watch. Forget it --- I can do without AMC as long as I can get NetFlix.\n\nBut the way, Spectrum requires only one rented cable box per household, although the company would love to rent you a cable box for every TV set in your house. As long as you rent at least one cable box, you can attach a Ruku device and install a Spectrum app for your other TV sets ---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku\n\nYou can buy a Ruku device for under $50 from Walmart with various other models available from Amazon.\n\nI've not yet installed my new Ruku device on our front room TV set. I'm hoping it will also allow me to access NetFlix. The only way I can access my wireless NetFlix in the den where I now have a cable box is also have a DVD player attached to the TV. The DVD player brings up buttons for NetFlix and other streaming services. But I don't need a DVD player on my second TV set. It's not so much the money. My wife just hates all the cords in all my nests.\n\nBy the way the cable technician who brought me a new high-speed router was very honest. He said that the new Spectrum router was a good thing but that I did not need the accompanying Spectrum wireless device for an added $5 per month. He said my ancient NetGear wireless was better than the Spectrum wireless.\n\nAccountants Are Making More Errors\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 21, 2018\n\nGood day. The number of material accounting mistakes made by U.S. public companies declined every year since 2006, but preliminary data for this year indicate a reversal.\n\nDo-over: During the first six months of 2018, 65 companies detected accounting mistakes significant enough to require them to restate and refile entire financial filings to regulators, compared with 60 companies for the same period last year, according to Audit Analytics.\n\nIt's in the details: The uptick came as finance teams were overhauling corporate accounting paperwork to comply with the new U.S. tax law and new revenue accounting rules.\n\nIn many instances CFOs and their staffs had to go over past financial reports to recalculate the value of tax credits or liabilities, or to assess how past results would look under new rules. In the process, companies including Seneca Foods Corp. and Camping World Holdings Inc. found errors that triggered restatements.\n\nWhat Italian politics (flat-rate taxation and universal income) and USA politics (think border wall, free higher education, and Medicare-for-All) have in common?\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 20, 2018\n\nItalys new populist government is facing a difficult decision: How to reconcile its expensive election promises with the reality of the countrys fragile finances\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThe solution is really simple.

His tenure at Tesla coincided with an unusual bout of public scrutiny. Mr. Morton joined the company on Aug. 6, one day before Chief Executive Elon Musk used social media to float the prospect of taking Tesla private.\n\nJensen Comment\n\nIt appears that Elon Musk's threat to take Tesla private was more of a ploy to punish short sellers than to actually take Tesla private. But he probably failed to realize that manipulating the market in this manner is really against the law. The good news for him is that the SEC is so short of enforcement resources that Elon might get away with his misdeed this time.\n\nThe sad news is that Tesla's turnover of executives is almost as bad as the turnover in Trump's White House staff.\n\nFrom the CFO Journal's Morning Ledger on September 4, 2018\n\nGood morning. When President Trump last month asked financial regulators to consider allowing public companies to report results on a semiannual, rather than quarterly, basis, he said the change would reduce costs and offer greater flexibility. That cost saving -- in terms of audit fees -- is likely to benefit smaller companies more than larger firms, lawyers and accountants said.\n\nFor audit costs, size matters: Accelerated and large accelerated filers paid audit fees of $541 per $1 million of revenue to their independent auditors in 2016, the latest full-year data available. By contrast, smaller reporting companies that posted positive revenue in 2016, a group of 1,554 companies, paid $3,345 per $1 million in revenue, according to an analysis from consulting firm Audit Analytics conducted for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt's complicated: An external auditor's review of three quarterly filings -- or Form 10-Qs -- in total account for roughly 15% to 20% of the overall audit cost, according to two former audit partners of two large accounting firms. (The fourth quarter results are filed as part of the annual report, which includes the annual audit). However, eliminating two such reviews would not slash two-thirds of the cost, they said, as the mid-year review would be more robust and command higher fees.\n\nOther risks: CFOs could also run the risk of making selective disclosures  sharing non-public information with only a handful of stakeholders  as certain investors ask for additional insights.\n\nTheres a chance you would be spending more time taking follow-up calls from analysts asking for the more detailed information theyre used to seeing in the 10-Q, said Keith Higgins, former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's division of corporation finance.\n\nTeaching Case From The Wall Street Journal Weekly Accounting Review on September 7, 2018\n\nTrump Asks SEC to Ease Earnings Reporting\n\nBy Dave Michaels, Michael Rapoport, and Jennifer Maloney | Aug 18, 2018\n\nTOPICS: SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nSUMMARY: President Trump has \"...asked regulators to review a decades-old requirement that public companies release earnings quarterly...\" Arguments for and against quarterly reporting versus less frequent intervals are presented. The related article focuses on the viewpoint \"probably\" held by investors that the cost of reduced transparency from less frequent reporting outweighs the benefits of that change.

Companies oblige by providing more than the SEC requires them toconference calls with question-and-answer sessions, lengthy news releases, detailed financial supplements and much else.\n\nFederal securities rules have required quarterly reporting since 1970, when the SEC required it as part of a formalization of stock-exchange practices that preceded the agencys creation in 1934.\n\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, said in a statement that the agency is studying the frequency of reporting.\n\nThe regulator plans to issue a document next week that seeks input on how to promote a long-term focus among public companies and investors, according to a person with knowledge of the SECs plans.\n\nBusiness groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce think scaling back the frequency of reports is a good idea. We would welcome an overhaul of a 1930s-era disclosure system that is not user-friendly and no longer meets the needs of a 21st century economy, said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the Chambers Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.\n\nContinued in article\n\nUnreliable Accounts: How Regulators Fabricate Conceptual Narratives to Diffuse Criticism\n\nSSRN\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3222559\n\n63 Pages Posted: 14 Aug 2018\n\nKarthik Ramanna\n\nHarvard Business School; University of Oxford - Blavatnik School of Government\n\nDate Written: July 5, 2018\n\nAbstract\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. accounting rulemaker (FASB) updated its longstanding constitution to eliminate reliability as a fundamental accounting property. FASB argued that reliability was misunderstood in practice and that this amendment clarified its original intent. Drawing on primary archival resources and field interviews with regulators, I provide evidence that the change also sought to legitimize the rise of fair-value accounting. By eliminating the need for accounting to be reliable, the change attempted to neutralize concerns about the subjectivity in fair-value estimates. Such subjectivity can facilitate accounting manipulation, and some fair-value rules can be attributed to lobbying by managers who stand to benefit. The change illustrates conceptual veiling, wherein regulators, seeking to diffuse criticism, including suspicions of capture, manufacture costly conceptual narratives for their actions.\n\nKeywords: Capital Markets, Fair-Value Accounting, FASB, Regulatory Capture\n\nSeptember 1, 2018 reply from Tom Selling\n\nMy impression was that the nail in the coffin for reliability was SFAS 106, which was not about fair value measurement. It required accrual of costs for other post-employment benefits. At the time, it was estimated that it added $1 trillion in aggregate to the balance sheets of public companies. Opponents of the standard that the measurement of the liability was not reliable. Proponents said that any accrual was better than none.\n\nTom\n\nSeptember 2, 2018 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nHi Tom,\n\nMarket reactions to FAS 106 varied for a variety of reasons ---\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/248592?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\nThe impact seemed to be largly to earnings effects. Of course most of the impact was due to recognition of the entire expense/liability than error in estimation. You're correct in that estimating measuring error in this case was virtually impossible.\n\nThe issue of whether FAS 106 numbers were less reliable than other numbers like pensions was formally studied. For example, see\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1506/T0VC-Q15Y-W5QV-4UKQ\n\nThis supports your reliability assertion\n\nThe reliability issue of FAS 106 was, however, greatly mitigated by discounting the stream of future benefits costs. I would contend that the reliability issue is much greater when estimating exit values of 300+ Days Inn hotels in 1987 ---\n\nhttp://faculty.trinity.edu/rjensen/theory02.htm\n\nNeither $87,356,000 book value is the residual historical cost nor the $194,812,000 is a reliable estimate of \"value in use\" of the net assets of Days Inns in 1987. At that time Days Inns was very much a private and highly successful going concern contemplating an initial public offering (IPO). FAS 157 excludes $197,812,000 as an estimate of \"value in use\" since piecemeal liquidation of the hotels is most likely the \"worst possible use\" of these hotels. Their values also have high covariance valuation components, especially the covariance of the real estate values with the goodwill value and human capital values of Days Inns. Furthermore, value in use of these properties will greatly change if the sign on each hotel is changed from Days Inn to Holiday Inn. The reason is that phantasmagoric summation of all the first order to n-th order covariance terms.\n\nThanks,\n\nBob\n\nseptember 10, 2018 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nSeptember 3, 2018 reply from Tom Selling\n\nBob,\n\nThanks for the valuable summary, which I will be thinking about further as I write. For now, Ill respond with a few quick observations:\n\nOne of the problems with FAS 33 was, and with GAAP in general, that the replacement cost estimates were the responsibility of management; hence, likely biased, and not effectively auditable. I envisage a financial reporting system that drastically limits the role of management estimates  if not completely eliminating them from the balance sheet.\n\nYou do not mention that appraisers rely heavily on recent actual transactions of comparable properties. In this manner, exit prices inform measures of entry costs. You are correct that it is hard to reliably separate the land costs from building costs. However, that is only needed for separating depreciation from other changes in current costs, which is a secondary issue for me.\n\nAs to benefitting analysts, deprival value as the measurement attribute is only one feature of S-OFA. My goal is to produce a comprehensive basis of accounting that is only 200 pages long  as opposed to the 8,000 that is U.S. GAAP. For one thing, even if estimates of replacement costs are more costly, the total cost of financial accounting should be much lower.\n\nBest,\n\nTom\n\nSeptember 3, 2018 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nHi Tom,\n\nOh Wow!\n\nI was not aware that you were proposing a radical departure from the tradition of financial reporting where the numbers are the primary responsibility of management with management also being responsible for the internal control system. Your ideas will totally change the traditional liability of management for financial reporting. Management may not be entirely off the hook, but the numbers and internal controls become the primary responsibility of a third party with management playing a lessor role in financial reporting. Wow!\n\nThe could well be a monumental book if the profession agrees that financial reporting of an entity is the responsibility of somebody other than management and that auditors are merely expressing an opinion that the numbers prepared by a third party conform to generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe role of joint and several liability will still probably exist, but now the lion's share of that responsibility may not belong to either management or the external auditors ---\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_and_several_liability\n\nPersonally, I doubt that the appraisal profession will be willing and/or able to shoulder the primary responsibility of providing financial statements in the capital markets. For one thing there's great moral hazard in doing so. Enron management succeeded in totally deceiving both its Audit Committee and its Board of Directors.\n\nThink of the ease with which the same Enron crooks could've deceived the appraisers or colluded with the appraisers (appraisers currently have a pretty awful reputation since the criminal appraisals of mortgage properties leading up to the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2007).\n\nThanks,\n\nBob\n\nSeptember 3, 2018 reply from Tom Selling\n\nBob:\n\nI began to articulate these views when I was invited to give a presentation to the Standing Advisory Group of the PCAOB on the topic of auditing estimates. That morphed into two articles, which I expect that AECM members can access through their libraries if they are interested. Note that we extensively address the issue of appraiser bias in the first article.\n\nIf one is teaching auditing (I do not) perhaps the second article from the CPA Journal article might be useful as a basis of class discussion?\n\nThe problem of management bias in accounting estimates: An investor perspective on root causes and solutions,\n\nThomas I. Selling and Bo Nordlund:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681315000609\n\nAbstract\n\nThe standards of the PCAOB implicitly, yet unmistakably, presume that auditors are capable of eliminating the material effects of management bias by constraining point estimates to a reasonable range. Yet, from inspection results of the PCAOB and its global counterparts we can confidently infer that auditors far too often fail to exercise sufficient skepticism of management's estimates. The consequences could be profound. Therefore, we are proposing fundamental changes to the rules of engagement between the auditor and its client. We would, incrementally over time, transfer the responsibility for financial statement judgments to independent appraisers. Auditing would become solely a verification service, and financial statements would better serve investors and the public interest.\n\nOn the Coexistence of Professionalism and Commercialism in CPA Firms\n\nhttps://www.questia.com/magazine/1P3-3704766651/on-the-coexistence-of-professionalism-and-commercialism\n\nVincent Love argued in the February 2015 issue of The CPA Journal that auditors' independence and professionalism is significantly challenged by the expansion of audit films offering services beyond the traditional competencies of CPAs (\"Can Professionalism and Commercialism Coexist in CPA Finns? Putting the Public Interest before Increased Profits,\" p. 6). This concents seem to be validated by regulators' reports of persistent problems with audit quality; however, the association between nonaudit services to nonclients and audit quality has not been established.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to argue that the main challenge to the profession lies within audit services themselves; specifically, the auditing of management's estimates. Instead of focusing on non-audit services, an accounting film can balance its business interests and the public interest by focusing audits on the verification of facts.\n\nThe Problem of Auditing Management's Estimates\n\nEstimates by management have become ubiquitous in accounting. They are embedded in the economic lives of buildings and machinery, the loan loss allowances of banks on debts of unstable governments, and practically everything else in between. It would not be an understatement to claim that the quality of modem financial reporting rises and falls with the collective integrity of management's estimates. Yet, one should also expect that managements' estimates will be biased.\n\nThere is also this related blog post:\n\nLook Beyond the Firms for the Root Causes of Audit Deficiencies\n\nhttp://accountingonion.com/2014/04/look-beyond-the-firms-for-the-root-causes-of-audit-deficiencies.html\n\nBest,\n\nTom\n\nSeptember 4, 2018 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nKeep in mind that a driving factor for professional responsibility in most any profession, aside from criminal prosecution, in the USA is the risk of litigation and judgments against the deepest pockets in civil lawsuits. Time and time again CPA firms and their clients have shown they have very deep pockets when they've not been deemed professionally responsible.\n\nYou assume you can make \"independent appraisers\" more professional than \"independent auditors.\" I'm very negative on the professionalism of appraisers who have minimal educational standards as a profession and minimal respect among the business community relative to the CPA profession. It will take decades of education reform, training, and litigation to bring the profession of appraisers up to speed. For one thing you do not mention that the \"appraisal profession\" is highly diverse in terms of education and standards. Appraisers of art work versus jewelry versus antiques versus real estate differ like day and night in terms of standards and education.\n\nWhat's more likely to happen is that the CPA profession will add appraisal expertise to the attestation profession that's already existed for over 100 years. And you will then give license to CPAs to add more degrees of freedom to subjectivity in financial reporting. Personally, I don't think capital markets will be overjoyed in the newer types of numbers they are being fed.\n\nI was not aware of the articles you referenced. I wonder how many AECMers were aware of those references.\n\nAlso keep in mind that there's a huge difference between the numbers in audited financial statements versus the non- audited numbers in management forecasts. Empirical tests should be run on the capital market reactions to management forecasts versus forecasts of \"appraisers\" whomever they might be. A great many studies have been conducted over the years on the accuracy of management forecasts. I do not know of a single study comparing earnings forecasts of management versus earnings forecasts of \"appraisers\" whomever they might be. We do know that there are often enormous discrepancies between real estate appraisals.\n\nHere are some other references of possible interest:\n\nHow Do Investors Assess the Credibility of Management Disclosures?\n\nhttp://www.aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/acch.2004.18.3.185?code=aaan-site\n\nHow Disaggregation Enhances the Credibility of Management Earnings Forecasts ---\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2007.00252.x\n\nThanks,\n\nBob Jensen\n\nAdded Comment by Bob Jensen\n\nThere are really two types of financial statements of interest here. The first is the traditional scorekeeping financial statement (e.g. a 10-K) traditionally used by financial analysts and used by Certified Value Appraisers to evaluate performance trends in earnings etc. Suppose shareholders' equity as audited in $10 million. The purpose of the GAAP-prepared 10-K is not to put a value on the entire firm. It's purpose is primarily that of keeping score on financial performance under GAAP rules --- a scorekeeping set of numbers under GAAP for Company ABC.\n\nThe second type is a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) financial statement that presumably adjusts balance sheet items (e.g., real estate) to some type of value (think exit value of balance sheet items) plus intangibles not valued in a 10K report (think value of the company's human resources), and then adjusts the aggregation of all those items for synergies of this particular company into a total firm \"value\" to be used in merger and acquisition negotiations. In other words the Certified Value Appraiser (CVA 1) hired by the company puts numbers on things, including synergies, that external auditors cannot and will not validate under present auditing standards. Suppose that CVA 1's M&A value of ABC shareholders' equity is $40 million.\n\nSuppose CVA 2 hired by the acquiring company XYC goes through the same type of exercise and places a $80 million value on ABC by adjusting for such things as the synergy of having XYZ owning all the items of value of ABC. It's a little like having a quarterback for the Steelers being worth $40 million to the Steelers but worth an estimated $80 if playing for the Eagles.\n\nThe biggest problems of the $40 million versus the $80 valuations of ABC are that those numbers cannot be reliably audited. A set of 10 different CVAs might put greatly different numbers on the maximum purchase price of ABC. The valuations of CVA 1 and CVA 2 are really just benchmarks that ABC and XYZ company owners will put on the negotiated purchase price.\n\nBut presumably the $10 million is auditable under GAAP rules such that the scorekeeping outcomes agreed to by either PwC or Ernst & Young if those firms both conducted first-rate audits according to GAAP.\n\nWe might argue like some accounting theorists (think Bob Sterling) that the $10 million is a useless number for any purpose. But empirical studies of GAAP earnings time and time again have shown that the $10 million is extremely valuable when compared with prior-year GAAP performance trends of ABC. It's not a very useful number for mergers and acquisitions mainly because of all the things not accounted for under GAAP (once again think of the unmeasured value of human resources).Vox: Trumps White House says wages are rising more than liberals think: The White House is probably right ---\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17823072/trump-cea-wages\n\nI guess my question is whether CVA's are prepared by education and training to prepare CVA financial statements (that probably cannot be audited) that are more useful than the annual financial statements certified by Pwc or Ernst & Young?\n\nI would argue that the day when investors and financial analysts will not easily give up their audited $10 million in favor of having either a $50 million CVA 1 number or an $80 million CVA 2 number or any other unaudited number in between.\n\nTo argue that CVAs are better at scorekeeping than ABC management, PwC, or Ernst & Young is to argue that all prior research pointing to value added of GAAP financial statements and audits is phony.\n\nI'm not prepared to buy into the proposition that what we now teach in accountancy is phony just because we admit that there are many things of value to a company that we just cannot measure and audit.\n\nMaybe I'm just an old fudd not willing to make little of the importance of what I taught for most of my 40 years in academe. And I have the empirical evidence to bolster my confidence in what I taught some of those auditors for PwC and Ernst & Young\n\nSeptember 10, 2018 reply from Bob Jensen\n\nA proposal for a monumental change in financial reporting: An enormous paradigm shift\n\nThe Problem of Management Bias in Accounting Estimates: An Investor Perspective on Root Causes and Solutions\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681315000609\n\nBefore getting into the article I might take issue with something Tom Posted to the AECM on September 3, 2018\n\nBob,\n\nThanks for the valuable summary, which I will be thinking about further as I write. For now, Ill respond with a few quick observations:\n\n· Tom Selling Reply\n\nOne of the problems with FAS 33 was, and with GAAP in general, that the replacement cost estimates were the responsibility of management; hence, likely biased, and not effectively auditable. I envisage a financial reporting system that drastically limits the role of management estimates  if not completely eliminating them from the balance sheet.\n\n·You do not mention that appraisers rely heavily on recent actual transactions of comparable properties. In this manner, exit prices inform measures of entry costs. You are correct that it is hard to reliably separate the land costs from building costs. However, that is only needed for separating depreciation from other changes in current costs, which is a secondary issue for me.\n\n·As to benefiting analysts, deprival value as the measurement attribute is only one feature of S-OFA. My goal is to produce a comprehensive basis of accounting that is only 200 pages long  as opposed to the 8,000 that is U.S. GAAP. For one thing, even if estimates of replacement costs are more costly, the total cost of financial accounting should be much lower.\n\nBest,\n\nTom\n\nJensen Comment\n\nThe assertion that FAS 33 estimates \"were not effectively auditable\" is misleading in that he's proposing an appraisal system that's even less auditable than the government's price indexing system promoted in FAS 33. It makes no sense to say that FAS 33 numbers are not effectively auditable because they were the responsibility of management for generating FAS 33 replacement cost (current cost) numbers. If being the responsibility of management makes them non-auditable then everything in a company's 10-K is not effectively auditable because all things in current 10-K reports are the responsibility of management. External auditors express and opinion about whether the GAAP numbers and disclosures in a 10-K conformed to the rules of GAAP. But the responsibility for everything including cash and inventory counts rests with management.\n\nIn other words, being the responsibility of management does not in and of itself make a 10-K incapable of being audited.\n\nEntry value (replacement cost, current cost) accounting never gained much traction in either the practice community or the academic community --- certainly not like exit value accounting expounded by various leading professors in the 20th Century. Historical cost accounting and replacement cost accounting are not really \"value accounting\" or \"fair value accounting\" --- which is a point made over and over again by AC Littleton in his time and ignored by Tom. Exit value accounting is value accounting or fair value accounting, but the estimates are estimated selling prices of each asset if the business is liquidated as a non-going concern.\n\nThe short-lived FAS 33 experiment in practice certainly never excited financial analysts or investors. Beginning in 1979, FAS 33 required large corporations to provide a supplementary schedule of condensed balance sheets and income statements comparing annual outcomes under three valuation bases --- Unadjusted Historical Cost, Price Level Adjusted (PLA) Historical Cost, and Replacement Cost Entry Value (adjusted for depreciation and amortization). Companies complained heavily that users did not obtain value that justified the cost of implementing FAS 33 with replacement cost estimates.\n\nTom Selling previously could not explain why in the many years of replacement cost advocacy (going back at least as far as John Canning's 1929 thesis) and the FAS 33 experiment replacement cost accounting never really found traction in academe or the world in investment analysts who never showed any interest in companies having to incur the huge costs of meaningful replacement cost financial statements.\n\nFAS 33 was rescinded in 1986 by the FASB in FAS 89. Corporations complained heavily about the cost of implementation, and financial analysts did not reveal a whole lot of interest in FAS 33 data. I don't recall anybody mentioning concerns over management biasing the replacement cost estimates. There were more concerns about how replacement cost distorted earnings with unrealized \"revenues\" from price changes.\n\nEmpirical support for replacement cost accounting was weak or negative:\n\nWatts, R. L. and J. L. Zimmerman. 1980. On the irrelevance of replacement cost disclosures for security prices. Journal of Accounting and Economics (August): 95-106.\n\nBeaver, W. H., P. A. Griffin and W. R. Landsman. 1982.The incremental information content of replacement cost earnings. Journal of Accounting and Economics (July): 15-39.\n\nSchaefer, T. F. 1984. The information content of current cost income relative to dividends and historical cost income. Journal of Accounting Research (Autumn): 647-656\n\nThe Accounting Standards Committee in England also ran a similar experiment on replacement cost accounting in SSAP 16 that was also rescinded ---\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6281.1996.tb00449.x/full\n\nIn his paper with Bo Nordlund, Tom Selling is now going to try to sell us on replacement cost accounting (misleadingly termed fair value accounting in their paper) on the basis that independent appraisers estimates of replacement costs are more independent than audited GAAP book values and earnings traditionally presented in financial statements like 10-K reports.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681315000609\n\nAbstract\n\nThe standards of the PCAOB implicitly, yet unmistakably, presume that auditors are capable of eliminating the material effects of management bias by constraining point estimates to a reasonable range. Yet, from inspection results of the PCAOB and its global counterparts we can confidently infer that auditors far too often fail to exercise sufficient skepticism of management's estimates. The consequences could be profound. Therefore, we are proposing fundamental changes to the rules of engagement between the auditor and its client. We would, incrementally over time, transfer the responsibility for financial statement judgments to independent appraisers. Auditing would become solely a verification service, and financial statements would better serve investors and the public interest.\n\nI will try to keep my comments Selling and Nordlund Paper as short as possible.\n\nThe paper proposes that independent appraisal firms take over the responsibility of financial reporting of businesses, especially corporations now subject to SEC financial reporting rules under GAAP promulgated by the FASB and tradition. Historical cost book values will be replaced by replacement cost book values (after depreciation) estimated by independent appraisers rather than management.\n\nFirstly, I might say that to do so without complete transitioning by the rest of the world (think of 100+ nations reporting under IFRS) would lead to worldwide capital markets chaos if the USA diverged fundamentally from the rest of the world in financial reporting. Presumably Selling and Nordlund are making a monumental proposal for the entire financial world. There"
