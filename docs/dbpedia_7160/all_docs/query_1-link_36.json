        "text": "Paris has many different nicknames, but its most famous is 'The City of Light' known in French as La Ville-Lumi?re. This is the nickname it was given both for its fame as a centre of education and ideas, plus its early adoption of street lighting.\n\nParis since the early 20th century has also been known in Parisian slang as Paname, which is a slang name that has been regaining popularity with the younger people in recent years.\n\nParis's inhabitants are known in English as \"Parisians\n\nThe City of Paris has an estimated population of 2,153,600 within its administrative limits. However, the Paris unite urbaine is an area of unbroken urban growth that extends well beyond the administrative city limits and has an estimated population of over 9,500,000. A commuter belt completes the Paris aire urbaine that, with its population of an estimated 12,000,000 is one of the most populated areas of its kind in Europe.\n\nParis is one of the world's leading business and cultural centres and has been an important settlement for more than two millennia, plus with its many influences including fashion, the arts, media, entertainment, science, education and politics, not forgetting the incredible French cuisine that can be found in many restaurants around Paris, then of course you have the French wines to taste as well, that have all contributed to making its status as one of the world's major global cities.\n\nThe Paris Region is the centre of economic activity within France and would you believe it, produced more than a quarter of the gross domestic product of France in the year 2006.\n\nLa Defense has become the largest purpose-built business district in Europe and it is home to the head offices of almost half of the major French companies. But the head offices of 15 of the world's largest companies are also based in this area.\n\nParis also plays host to many different international organisations such as UNESCO and the ICC.\n\nParis has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, with over 30 million foreign visitors per year.\n\nThe city plays host to numerous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Arc de Triomphe and The Champs-Elysees, to name but a few, plus popular places like Disneyland Paris Resort."
