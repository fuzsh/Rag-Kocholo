        "text": "How did you find living in Tournai? Would you recommend it? What is the city like?\n\nTournai is a small city that lies on the French border. The building are beautiful, especially at the Grand Place.\n\nWhat is student life like in Tournai?\n\nStudent life in Tournai is severely lacking. The locals mainly go out at the weekend but not really during the week. But there are lots of cafes.\n\nWhat is the cost of living like in Tournai?\n\nAverage - cheaper the Brussels.\n\nWas it difficult to find accommodation in Tourmai? Any advice?\n\nNot at all. Erasmus students can ask their university/college to help them find accommodation. For example, my college (HELHa - social - communication) had student accommodation. There is always a way to find a room in student accommodation or an apartment in town.\n\nWhat is the food like? What are your favourite dishes?\n\nBelgians love fries. You really should get some at Frites à Gogo where you can also get amazing burgers. There are also lots of sandwich shops near the university.\n\nWhat do you recommend seeing in Tournai?\n\nThe cathedral, the bell tower, the bridge of holes, the Grand Place, one or two churches, the park, the statue of Martine next to Fort Rouge...\n\nAnd for food? Where are your favourite places?\n\nI really like l'Orchidée (a small brasserie/café at the Grand Place). There are lots of restaurants dotted around the city: the Grand Place, the quays etc.\n\nLe Corto Malté is a great tapas bar (it's a bit expensive but still affordable).\n\nAnd you must go to Vanille et Chocolat (Grand Place) for ice cream!\n\nWhere do you recommend going out in Tournai?\n\nThe Irish Pub is probably one of my favourite places in the city: the atmosphere is generally really chilled, they show football matches some evenings, St Patricks Day is mad, the staff are really friendly and the cocktails are great. It's a fantastic place! You can also go there on New Years Eve to celebrate.\n\nStefens Café: A nightclub for the youngsters (if you like that kind of thing).\n\nAny advice for future Erasmus students in Tournai?\n\nIf you like small cities, you'll like the charm of Tournai. And at the weekend if you like going out, it's the place to be!"
