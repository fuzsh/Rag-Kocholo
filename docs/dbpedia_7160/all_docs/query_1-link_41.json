        "text": "Lyon is well known as the lovely city has been called the gastronomic capital of France. Note that Lyon is home to more than 4000 restaurants. From ancient “bouchons” where you will eat rich specialties like Quenelles de Brochet or Cervelles de Canut (cheese specialty from Lyon) to gastronomic restaurants and food markets, you will have plenty of choice to experience a new cuisine and satisfy your appetite. Located between Paris and South Of France, Lyon is a crossroads city at the confluence of two rivers: the Saône and the Rhône. Its position makes this city magical thanks to a rich history dating back to the Roman Period. Looking back at history, Emperor Julius Caesar first created “Lugdunum” in 43 BC.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lugdunum became the capital of the Gauls. The city is already at a crossroads between imperial routes between the Rhine and Italy.The City of Lyon enjoys a very rich period of prosperity and is an important economic and intellectual center. After a turbulent Middle Ages period, in the 15th century, Lyon knows a renewal with the development of multiple commercial fairs. Through the influence of Italy and Kings of France Francois I and Henri IV, the silk production boomed from the 16th to the 18th century. The best way to admire and visit Lyon is by walking. Through the Old Lyon and Croix Rousse neighborhood, you will see multitude of traboules-secret and covered passageways- that were used by the silk traders as a shortcut across town.\n\nDo not miss the jewel of the city Basilica of Notre Dame de Fourviere. The majestic basilica devoted to Mary was built in the end of the 19th century. Tie your sneakers and ride the funicular up or climb the 228 steps to admire this pure beauty. From there, the views over the city which counts more than 500 000 inhabitants is spectacular. On the way back, pass through the ruins of ancient Lugdunum and its amphitheater."
