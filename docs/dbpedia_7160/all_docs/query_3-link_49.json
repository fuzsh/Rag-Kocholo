        "text": "Tournai is a small town situated in the Belgian region of Wallonia. It has two UNESCO World Heritage sites, namely the Belfry and the Notre Dame Cathedral. The cathedral is impressive, outside the focus falls on its five towers and inside on its naves. It is Gothic and Romanesque, with a unique feel. A few years ago an earthquake seriously affected its structure and since then work is done on it. The Belfry is a beautiful bell tower from which you can enjoy a view of the city. Apart from these two monuments, you can also see the Grand Place with its Flemish buildings and enjoy a stroll along the banks of the river."
