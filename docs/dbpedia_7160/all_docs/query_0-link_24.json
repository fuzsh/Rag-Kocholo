        "text": "Francia, also called the Kingdom of the Franks, was the largest post-Roman kingdom in Western Europe. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, it split into West, East, and Middle Francia. East and West Francia would eventually become Germany and France respectively, while Middle Francia further divided into Lotharingia, Burgundy, and Italy.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 481, the Roman province of Gaul was established as the Kingdom of Francia, five years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In 768, Charlemagne, a member of the Order of the Ancients, ascended to the throne.\n\nThe Frankish capital of Paris was a target for two important Viking raids in their expansion across Europe. The first was an invasion led by the legendary Swedish king Ragnar Lothbrok in 845, resulting in the plunder and occupation of the city, which only came to an end when Charles the Bald gave the invaders 7,000 livres of silver and gold.[2] The second attack would involve a much larger raiding force of 30,000 to 40,000 Vikings under the command of Rollo. During the raid, the Raven Clan shieldmaiden Eivor Varinsdottir managed to infiltrate the city and form alliances inside.[3] Charles the Fat eventually allowed the raiders to sail up the River Seine to raid Burgundy to avoid a complete sacking of the city.[4]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAssassin's Creed: Valhalla – Blood Brothers (first appearance)\n\nEchoes of History (mentioned only)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Valhalla (mentioned only)\n\nThe Siege of Paris\n\nDiscovery Tour: Viking Age (mentioned only)\n\nThe World of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Journey to the North – Logs and Files of a Hidden One (mentioned only)\n\nAssassin's Creed: Mirage (mentioned only)"
