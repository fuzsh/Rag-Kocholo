        "text": "Increase the visibility of the Carré Bleu (Blue Square)\n\nThe intervention is not limited to a particular form. It should be eye-catching and make the Carré Bleu (Blue Square) more recognisable. The intervention should create and highlight value. It should be surprising and relatable. We are not looking for ordinary signposts, but for a product, an idea or even a service. The intervention will contribute to the character of the Blue Park and the Carré Bleu (Blue Square). The concept of the Blue Park is to be used as a source of inspiration: a contiguous area of water and vegetation, a shared space for nature, outdoor activities and entrepreneurship.\n\nThis 90-km route, which can be completed in one or two days, follows the towpaths along the principal navigable waterways of the Eurometropolis: the rivers Deûle, Lys and Scheldt as well as the Bossuit-Kortrijk, Spierekanaal and Roubaix canals.\n\nOver the centuries, towns have developed on the banks of these waterways: Kortrijk, city of architecture, art and design, is completely oriented towards the water with its parks, promenades, playgrounds and cafés on the banks of the river Lys; the lively town of Menen was an important centre of the textile industry in the 14th century; Wervik boasts a tobacco museum; Comines, with its rich history, is the only Walloon city that was subsequently occupied by the German and Allied armed forces in the First World War; the artistic and historical city of Lille boasts various museums and a vibrant centre where you can relax on the banks of the Haute Deûle or the Roubaix canal; Roubaix features an art and industry museum located in one of the most beautiful art deco swimming pools from the 1930s; Tourcoing has a hydraulicbridge …\n\nCycle along the streams, rivers and canals and discover the blue heritage of theEurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai. Explore the Blue Park, with the Carré Bleu (Blue Square) as the principal route. This Blue Park makes a significant contribution to the strong identity of the Eurometropolis.\n\nThis identity will be reinforced by means of unique signage thanks to the collaboration between all partners of the Interreg project Tripod-II and Lille World Design Capital 2020."
