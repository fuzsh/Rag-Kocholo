        "text": "Storemyr, P. & Heldal, T. (2017): Reconstructing a Medieval Underground Soapstone Quarry: Bakkaunet in Trondheim in an International Perspective. In: Hansen, G. & Storemyr, P., Soapstone in the North: Quarries, Products and People. 7000 BC – AD 1700. UBAS University of Bergen Archaeological Series, 9, 107-130. Underground medieval quarries are rare, in Norway and elsewhere in Europe. Thus the question: Could a big underground soapstone quarry have been opened at Bakkaunet in Trondheim (central Norway) in the Middle Ages? This question of stone procurement for Nidaros Cathedral – which is Europe’s northernmost medieval cathedral and a building heavily influenced by English traditions and fashions – has bothered us for the last 20 years. In this paper we discuss what we think the quarrymen did. It is a biography of the now almost lost Bakkaunet quarry, with a focus on the question about underground operations. But the paper also discusses stone procurement for Nidaros Cathedral in view of contemporary international, especially English, trends. The story is sad, for the open-cast part of this once great quarry, very close to the centre of Trondheim, has been successively destroyed by modern house building over the last century.\n\nLarge-scale GIS-based landscape analysis was used to gain insight into the complex distribution pattern of megalithic monuments built by Funnel Beaker societies in the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark. The main research question was whether this distribution pattern is related to the availability of building materials: the erratic boulders and blocks that were transported to the Low Countries by ice sheets during the Quaternary glaciations. It was found that the majority (57.4%) of the chosen building sites is related to areas where glacial tills are present in the subsurface. Further analysis of the distribution of glacial till types has revealed that tills of East Baltic provenance contain most monuments (85.7%). When compared with the total area of glacial tills this comes down to 0.12 monuments per km2 East Baltic till vs. only 0.013 monuments per km2 Swedish till. The preference for East Baltic tills was also tested on a smaller scale by studying the rock type and provenance for erratic boulders used in four passage graves in Drenthe (NL). It has become clear that in some areas with East Baltic tills, not only East Baltic boulders were used but also South Swedish material and especially pink Smålandgranites. Furthermore, statistical methods were applied to investigate whether the builders of these four monuments intentionally selected pink coloured boulders. For passage graves Drouwen-D19 and D20 it has been calculated that pink boulders are significantly overrepresented which could point to colour-based selection.\n\nThis paper, presented at the VIII Nordic Meeting on Stratigraphy and the EAA meeting in Helsinki 2012, deals with the stratigraphy and typology of post-reformation burials, primarily those encountered during excavations in the North transept of Uppsala Cathedral in 2007 (Kjellberg et al 2011). This was at that time the largest excavation ever conducted inside the cathedral. The excavation resulted in a substantial amount of archaeological data, with features such as a preserved and previously unknown medieval cellar, foundations for a medieval gallery and original floor levels, two preserved and intact burial chambers and remains of more than 150 medieval and post-medieval burials. In total, the remains of 18 more or less preserved coffins, all dating to the post-reformation period, were recorded. The stratigraphical analysis revealed a chronological pattern in the development of coffin shapes and coffin attributes. This inspired an outline for a typology that may be used as a tool for dating future finds of unstratified burials. The typology has since been tested and modified through comparison with other well-dated and documented archeological and art historical coffins from within other churches in Central Sweden. To a lesser extent comparison with materials from excavated churchyards have been made.\n\nAbstract A characteristic feature of the Stone Age coastlines on the Finnish side of the Gulf of Bothnia is a wide range of stone structures, such as so-called ‘Giants’ churches’, settlement embankments, heaps of fi re-cracked rocks, and other heaps of stones, some of which may be burial cairns. In 2011, a low and almost rectangular stone setting (size c. 3.5 x 4 x 0.3 m) fi lled with red ochre was excavated at the Keelaharju site. The site surrounding the structure is interpreted as a seasonally used camp originally located on top of a tiny island in a maritime environment. Based on shoreline displacement chronology the site is dated to c. 4600 cal. BC. In northern Europe, amounts of red ochre comparable to what was found in the Keelaharju stone setting have only been recorded in burial contexts. Furthermore, similar structures found in Sweden can unambiguously be identifi ed as graves. In order to clarify the cultural context of the Keelaharju stone setting, a range of red ochre graves with stone structures are presented and discussed. As an outcome, the stone settings with red ochre around the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland and Sweden, as well as those in northern Norway, are interpreted as a local burial custom which is rooted in red ochre burials of the eastern part of the Baltic Sea, but in which the use of a stone setting or a low cairn emerges as an independent north European innovation, eventhough some clues may point to the eastern origin.\n\nBesides a large number of blanks, the flint assemblage from Timmendorf-Nordmole I includes several worked flint tools. These can be characterised as typical of the late Ertebølle culture. Their composition underlines the highly specialised character of Timmendorf-Nordmole I as a hunting and fishing camp site, an interpretation also indicated by the organic tools. In particular the different tool types are described. The most frequent are flake axes, truncated blades and transverse arrowheads. While the former can be seen as woodworking tools to prepare hunting equipment, the blade tools are interpreted as knives to process the kill. This is supported by the find of a hafted truncated blade. A comparison of the flake axes with assemblages from synchronic sites in the southern Baltic Sea area provided no proof for different regional groups as regards the style and size of axes.\n\nThe Early Nordic Bronze Age oak coffin burials include some of Europe’s best preserved human remains. Although traditional typological examinations thereof have not always found clear foreign references, recent provenance investigations from Egtved and Skrydstrup suggest that the two women were of non-local provenance. In order to investigate potential mobility patterns and how these might or might not be related to the archaeological evidence at first sight, we conducted comprehensive multi-analytical investigations on the rich burial of the Ølby Woman, another key female oak coffin burial. Her grave included, inter alia, a large number of metal items, the remains of a corded skirt and a glass bead recently identified as of Egyptian origin. We conducted strontium isotope analyses of the dental tooth enamel of Ølby Womans’s first, second and third molars to investigate her provenance and potential mobility through childhood. Furthermore, we conducted lead isotope and craft technical..."
