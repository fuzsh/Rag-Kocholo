        "text": "What are French Tech Capitals and Communities?\n\nMission French Tech supports and leads a network, consolidated in 2023, of 115 structures labeled French Tech, in France and abroad.\n\nFrench Tech Capitals and Communities are real gateways for French start-ups to the French Tech ecosystem. Present throughout France and in 52 countries around the world, they federate the innovation players in their territory (start-ups, investment funds, support structures, public services, financiers, major groups, research centers…) and mobilize them on joint initiatives, in line with the challenges of the Mission French Tech and according to the local priorities of their ecosystem.\n\nThe 17 French Tech Capitals\n\nThe French Tech are the relays of the Mission French Tech on the national territory. They are made up of teams who develop the technological and digital ecosystem of their region and deploy the Mission French Tech programs.\n\nThe French Tech Capitals network welcomes 3 new accreditations\n\nThe French Tech Capitals network expands to welcome 3 new Capitals.\n\nThe French Tech Communities in France\n\nThe French Tech Communities in France are groups of volunteer entrepreneurs who, in addition to the actions carried out by the French Tech Capitals, animate the ecosystem of innovation players on a local scale and intensify their collaboration. They are made up of founders, investors, employees and tech players, and any other stakeholders involved in promoting French Tech in their geographical area.\n\nFrance’s network of French Tech Communities expands with 2 new accreditations\n\nThe network of French Tech Communities in France has been strengthened by 2 new accredited structures:\n\nFrench Tech Communities abroad\n\nThe French Tech International Communities are groups of volunteer French or Francophile entrepreneurs who represent the Mission French Tech internationally. Their actions promote the French tech ecosystem alongside the French institutional network in each country.\n\nThe network of French Tech Communities abroad expands with 9 new accreditations\n\nThis network, at the heart of French Tech’s international action, is now made up of 66 communities, spread across 52 countries and 5 continents. The network of French Tech communities abroad has been strengthened by the addition of 9 new accredited structures:"
