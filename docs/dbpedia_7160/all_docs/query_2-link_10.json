        "text": "UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES IN TOURNAI, BELGIUM\n\nThere are 2 UNESCO sites in Tournai. 23 Belfries all over France and Belgium were brought under the wings of UNESCO in 1999 CE. One of the 23 is here in Tournai. The other is the Notre Dame Cathedral. Let’s see more about the Cathedral, one of the tourist places in Belgium as well as one of the important churches/pilgrimage sites in Belgium!\n\nTORNADO IN TOURNAI & RESTORATION OF NOTRE-DAME CATHEDRAL\n\nTo begin with, it is under restoration (like my luck at Pisa Cathedral, Sagrada Familia, Florence Duomo etc)!!! However, the restoration here has been happening since 1999 and not going to finish any time soon…. Reason: out of blue-moon, or rather, much much rarer than blue-moon, a tornado struck Tournai in 1999… So bad that one of the towers of the Cathedral, moved by 80cm!!! Since then, till now restoration is on in parts, to protect the cathedral from collapsing!!! Hopes are to finish the restoration by 2026…\n\nHISTORY OF TOURNAI\n\nIn 12th C, when King Philippe Augustus became the self-appointed king, he ruled the then French country with Tournai as capital, thus making Tournai, effectively, the first capital city of modern France!!! This site being in the crossroads of England, Champagne and Normandy, was then an extremely important site, so much that holding on to Pont des Trous bridge across river Scheldt was such an important defence point. Today it’s just 10km from the French border!\n\nARCHITECTURE OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, TOURNAI\n\nThe architecture of Notre Dame Cathedral Tournai is very unique as it kept improving over the years! The nave is Romanesque, the altar is Gothic and the transepts are a beautiful mix of the 2 styles! The humongous 4 tiered nave was just majestic!!! Ages ago, the upper floors were used to invite important religious persons who kept pouring in here, all the time, including mass hours!\n\nThe rounded arches with rounded pillars of the Roman style and the pointed arches and octagonal pillars (the early stages of what Duomo di Milano is the peak!) of the Gothic style can be very well observed when you’re standing halfway through, outside! It’s just intriguing! Originally the whole Cathedral was Romanesque styled. However, by 14th C CE, Gothic vaults and columns were added to improve the strength and stability of the building which was really massive and way too tall in terms of the era!\n\nHOUSING AT NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, TOURNAI\n\nOn either side of the cathedral are the monastery, school and hospital that were operated by the clergy. Today they aren’t functional except for the bishop who lives here! The bishop when King Philippe Augustus ruled, made a pathway across the street to connect the cathedral from the monastery, so he could walk to the cathedral without stepping onto the street which belonged to the municipality!!!!! Why?? I'll tell you about it in the next post!!!\n\nSCULPTURES OF TOURNAI NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, TOURNAI\n\nAs soon as you enter the church the first wow moment is the portal sculptures! The most important is of Saint Eleutherius of Tournai, who is seen holding the cathedral itself in his palm! Another important sculpture is of Saint Piatus of Tournai who’s seen holding the Bible and the top of his skull as well!!! Well, he was martyred by slicing-off the top of his skull by the Roman emperor, Maximian. These sculptures belong to multiple eras from 14th C CE onwards.\n\nGRANDE PROCESSION DE TOURNAI (GRAND PROCESSION OF TOURNAI)\n\nAnother series of sculptures is the entire scene describing the power of clergy to increase and collect tax (which was later discovered to be a sham with a fake seal altogether)!!! Also depicted is the major plague epidemic of 11th C CE that killed many. A grand procession across the town, under Bishop Radbad II, the then Bishop happened and soon after that, the epidemic ended. Coincidence or divine intervention - you decide. To date the procession happens annually.\n\nDate of Grand Procession of Tournai 2021 - 12th Sept 2021 10:00AM\n\nHISTORY OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL TOURNAI\n\nThe origins of this church are from 5th C CE. However the major construction happened in 12th - 13th C CE after Tournai became the capital city of France under King Philippe Augustus. Once you are through the main door, on the left are the still visible remains of the early (since 5th C CE) foundation and architecture of the church, including 11th C CE pipes, baptism font etc! The grey limestone pillars are indigenous to Tournai, called Tournai stone. The cornices of the pillars have some basic sculptural detail. The Romanesque Church was filled with stunning frescoes as well everywhere incl these pillars and this being a very rich church, the background of the frescoes were blue of lapis lazuli!!! However, by 17th C CE, it was completely whitewashed. Some murals are said to still survive which can only be seen after the restoration is over.\n\nSTAINED GLASS WINDOWS OF TOURNAI NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL\n\nThe façade stained glass was much more elaborate, which is today transferred inside the church and replaced with the rose window! Portions of the cathedral were destroyed in WWII but most survived. However, the molten lead of some of the tombstones is standing proof of the heat that was generated during the bombing!!!\n\nCATHEDRA THRONE OF TOURNAI NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL\n\nIn front of the choir is the Cathedra - the seat of the bishop. From the choir, there was nothing to see, as it was all covered for restoration. The stone screen designed by Corneille de Vriendt was just stunning thought with relief sculptures depicting scenes from both old and new testaments.\n\nTREASURY OF TOURNAI NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL\n\nThe keystone of the transepts was so high at 50m! Behind this is the treasury/museum where photography isn’t allowed. This is filled with so many stunning pieces of art and key pieces of history including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket’s cape etc! The roofing is all grey slate since the Gothic era. However, the Romanesque church seems to have had colourful tiles (something similar to Basel Munster). Restoration is underway to make it colourful as before. This can be seen from atop the Belfry! Coming back soon about the Belfry, Bishop and more!!!\n\nHOW TO REACH TOURNAI FROM BRUSSELS\n\nHow to reach Tournai from Brussels by car: 90km\n\nHow to reach Tournai from Brussels by train: Intercity trains are available and the journey takes about 1 hr. Here are some ways to get cheap Belgian Train tickets.\n\nHOW TO REACH NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, TOURNAI\n\nWhere is Tournai Notre dame Cathedral (On Google Maps): Notre-dame Cathedral\n\nFrom Tournai Railway station to Cathedral: 1km\n\nNOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, TOURNAI OPENING HOURS\n\nCathedral - 9:00AM to 6:00PM (Mon-Fri); 9:00 AM to 12:00noon & 1:30PM to 6:00PM (Sat, Sun)\n\nTreasury - 10:00AM to 6:00PM (Mon-Fri); Mon morning holiday; 1:30PM to 6:00PM (Sat, Sun)\n\nNOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL TOURNAI TICKETS\n\nTournai Notre Dame Cathedral entry ticket: Free\n\nTournai Notre Dame Cathedral Treasury entry ticket: €2.5\n\n1 hr Guided Tour (incl Belfry) is available on Sundays for €5 per head at 2:30pm in Dutch; 3:30pm in English; 4:30pm in French.

So I don't have a personal review of any of the Tournai Hotels. The best budget hotel option in Tournai is of course the Tournai Youth Hostel. There are a few charming historic hotels in Tournai including D'Alcantara, Les Studios de la Grand Place, ONIRO - Wellness Rooms & Suites etc.\n\nP.S: I was invited by VisitTournai to experience the city for review purposes, however, the opinions are my own and this post does not advertise the product/service.\n\nBhushavali\n\nAn ardent traveler by passion.
