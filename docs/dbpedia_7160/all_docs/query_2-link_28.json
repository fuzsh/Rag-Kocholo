After being conquered by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC, Tournai prospered as a Roman colony called Tornacum. It was an important commercial and military centre near the Roman road linking Cologne and Boulogne-sur-Mer. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Tournai came under the control of the Salian Franks. In the 9th century, it became the capital of the County of Flanders under the Baldwin Iron Arm. The city grew into an important centre of commerce known for its textile production, tapestries and sculptures. After the destructive sackings by the Viking Norsemen, Tournai began to rebuild and construct the Romanesque Tournai Cathedral, which was consecrated in 1171. Over the centuries, the city came under the rule of the Dukes of Burgundy and the Habsburg Netherlands. It was taken by Louis XIV of France in the late 17th century, who destroyed its ramparts and devastated the city.
