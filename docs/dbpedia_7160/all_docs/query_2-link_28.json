It was an important commercial and military centre near the Roman road linking Cologne and Boulogne-sur-Mer. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Tournai came under the control of the Salian Franks. In the 9th century, it became the capital of the County of Flanders under the Baldwin Iron Arm. The city grew into an important centre of commerce known for its textile production, tapestries and sculptures.
