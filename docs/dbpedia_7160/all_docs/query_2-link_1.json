        "text": "Tournai, the first French capital\n\nTournai, a city which is a genuine slice of history in itself. The first capital of France and over 2000 years old, it is one of the oldest cities in Belgium. Its monuments are impressive and its inhabitants are as welcoming as they come. If you sit down for a few minutes in the shade of the cathedral, you will undoubtedly feel like you are home.\n\nVisit two thousand years of history\n\nIt its historical centre, Tournai opens the doors to 2000 years of history to you. A particularly rich history that is visited by following trails that are marked out by the lecterns and statues that lie at strategic points of the visit. An important point, is that Tournai gives you a whole host of ways to explore these trails: on foot, by segway, on a little tourist train, with an audio guide or accompanied by a tour guide.\n\nTournai has, in quite a small geographical area, two remarkable UNESCO listed heritage sites: its imposing cathedral and its belfry. Continuing along your stroll through the historical centre you will discover Saint-George's tower, the Red Fort, the Grand-Place and Place Saint-Pierre.\n\nThe cathedral gave Tournai its nickname of the \"City of five bell towers\". But did you know that only one of these towers contains bells? Upon entering the building you can't fail to be impressed by the horizontal, four-storied and two-rowed nave. Take the time to look up and observe the columns: you will be pleasantly surprised to see that they are all different. It is also impossible to miss the superb rose window that represents the city. The Belfry and its 257 steps takes you all the way to the top of the cathedral and gives you an unobstructed view of the city and its surrounding area. A must see before your visit of the city, so that you can get your bearings, or afterwards, to appreciate the route you have just completed. If you are visiting the city on a Sunday, you will be lucky enough to here the beautiful bells chiming? The bells used to announce good and bad news to the people of Tournai.\n\nAs for the Red Fort, it owes its name to the colour of its tiles. Inside, you will find an itinerary designed to tell you haw Tournai and its fortifications evolved through history. Before entering, why not stop for a moment at the foot of the fort, where you will find the statue of Martine and her dog Patapouf, famous characters created by two Tournai authors: Marlier and Delahaye, who have enchanted thousands of children all over the world.\n\nSome must-see stops\n\nAnother historical site, the \"Pont des Trous\" is a stunning construction. The bridge, which dates back to the 13th century, is a military construction, one of the rare river doors still in existence. It was built to defend the Escault river. You will find it easily if you stroll along the banks of the Escaut, by foot or using the little tourist train which also takes you on to visit Tournai's other must-sees.\n\nThe Tournai Fine Arts Museum, conceived by Victor Horta is another remarkable building. Staying faithful to the Art Nouveau style it stands out thanks to its original and bright, open architecture. Not to mention the collections of works open to the public that include pieces from as far back as the 15th century alongside more contemporary artworks.\n\nThe TAMAT, another big museum in the Tournai, is dedicated to the textile arts of yesteryear and the present day. Rediscover the mural arts and fabric arts. Tournai, an artistic city, exhibits historical pieces which made its name in the 15th and 16th centuries. You can discover beautiful tapestries at the Halle-aux-Draps. Initially, in the 13th century, the Halle was used for the sale of foodstuffs and other artisan produce. Then, when the cloth industry took off; the building turned became specialised in textile trades. There were up to 2.500 professions in the 14th century.\n\nA family visit\n\nTournai, the historical city, is a family destination par excellence. The Rando Famili route, with its audio guide, was devised specifically for your little ones and allows for the discovery of the seven most important sites. To accompany your children on their trip, the Wap Aventure games book offers them a chance to discover the city while attempting to solve an enigma which has been created just for them."
