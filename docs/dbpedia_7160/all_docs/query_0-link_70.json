        "text": "In 2001, the closure of the Fives Cail Babcock steelworks – a major local employer in Lille’s Fives district – signalled the decline of a once-thriving industrial area. Unemployment subsequently rose to 20 %. Today, people under 30 account for almost half the district’s residents and have little option but to seek work outside the neighbourhood.\n\nWith the TAST’in FIVES project, Lille is renovating a 2 050 m2 hall on a former brownfield site. Chaud Bouillon, expected to open by 2021, will provide a shared space where local residents can train, cook, dine and socialise.\n\nA taster of things to come\n\nWorks on the Chaud Bouillon site are ongoing, so a temporary site has been constructed in the meantime. The Avant-goût is open daily from 8.00 to 22.00 and offers training facilities, indoor and outdoor dining spaces and an urban farm. In the summer of 2018 and 2019, it hosted a food court with four restaurants and two bars.\n\nThe Avant-goût has proved to be a great success. About 120 000 people from all over the city have already used the area. It has created jobs and will enable training for people of all ages. During the summer, around 20 people work on site daily to manage its activities.\n\nInitial activities included a cookery workshop in a theatre kitchen where participants created a menu and served it with a theatre performance. Around 1 300 events have taken place, including workshops with elderly citizens or homeless people and local initiatives hosted by NGOs or entrepreneurs. Activities with schools have helped raise awareness about the importance of a balanced diet, and enabled children to discover different kinds of food. About 20 000 people have taken part in such events.\n\nWhile many of the activities have raised awareness about food waste and healthy eating, TAST’in FIVES also looks to address other challenges such as isolation, lack of social interaction, lack of training options and loss of civic pride. It is fostering a network to support the permanent kitchen once it opens.\n\nThe next course\n\nOnce complete, Chaud Bouillon will include a communal kitchen, an incubator for new food businesses and a food court, all under one roof. The central food hall will cover an area of 1 000 m2 and will host daily cultural events. Agreements have been signed with the private and public organisations who will manage these services.\n\nLocal residents will be involved in designing and running the community kitchen, which will support new economic and social activities. Food start-ups will be able to make use of the facility’s professional training kitchen and food incubator.\n\nTAST’in FIVES will integrate a technological dimension by developing an experimental module for vertical urban farming and contact-free technologies to design smart stock management systems. It will help reduce food waste and facilitate the distribution of meals in collaboration with social NGOs."
