        "text": "The Tournai xpo project, a significant part of the SmarTournai portfolio, focuses on reinforcing urban attractiveness for citizens, visitors, and businesses. The renovated exhibition hall, covering 12,000 square meters, has been upgraded for improved functionality, equipment, thermal insulation, and acoustics.\n\nDuring the event, Commissioner Ferreira highlighted the project's alignment with EU priorities, emphasizing sustainability, energy efficiency, and community engagement. She praised the collaborative efforts between the European Union, Wallonia region, and the City of Tournai in realizing this impactful urban development.\n\nTournai xpo, as part of the ERDF program, illustrates the positive impact of EU funds in creating vibrant, resilient, and community-focused urban spaces. Commissioner Ferreira's presence underscored the EU's dedication to supporting projects that address economic, social, and environmental challenges in urban areas.\n\nLooking ahead, the ERDF program for 2021-2027 continues to focus on sustainable urban development. The success of the first call for projects under this program in Wallonia demonstrates a commitment to creating a more intelligent, greener, and connected Europe."
