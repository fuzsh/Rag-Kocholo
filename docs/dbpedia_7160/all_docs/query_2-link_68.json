        "text": "Belgium is big on festivals. You could arrive in a town or village to find that the populace has turned out, some of them in costume, to honor with all due solemnity (followed by some fun and games) the local cheese. The country has a lively and colorful Carnival tradition, which includes, in the otherwise unremarkable town of Binche, one that's among the most spectacular in Europe.\n\nThe Festival of Flanders is a program of cultural events that runs at venues throughout Flanders from September to June.

The pre-Lenten festival brings good-natured mayhem to the streets of this otherwise sober town.
