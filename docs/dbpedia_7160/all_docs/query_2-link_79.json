        "text": "So, time to wave goodbye to Brugge and my mates Luke and Old Man Dave and take an hour’s leisurely drive to Tournai, a place I haven’t visited before. ‘Where is Tournai?’ I hear you say. Located in south west Belgium on the French border, the city is part of the province of Hainaut in the region of Wallonie. Referred to as ‘Belgium’s best-kept secret’, with not one but two Unesco World Heritage Sites, it certainly appeared to be a lovely place to spend the day and night. However, sightseeing wasn’t the main reason for my visit. Just south east of the city, the N7 road takes you on a tour of a number of small villages, many with breweries that produce the region’s famous Saison beer. I love a Saison – tart, yeasty, effervescent – the beer is often referred to as ‘farmhouse ale’ as it was originally brewed by farmers as a low-abv thirst quencher for their labourers. The beer is now a style and brewers all over the world produce their own unique interpretation. We have even brewed one at Fuller’s – Matariki is Hayley Marlor’s New Zealand Saison brewed in collaboration with Marble from Manchester.\n\nOne thing that I didn’t factor into my trip was that the day I arrived was Assumption Day and a public holiday in Belgium. This meant that the breweries would be closed – bad planning or a stroke of luck? Without the tasting rooms being open I reckoned that I would be able to pack in as many of these breweries as possible and leave time for a stroll around the city’s sites and a couple of cheeky Saisons. First up was Dubuisson, producer of the legendary Bush beer and Cuvee des Trolls. However, they have also revived a Saison recipe and their Surfine is an outstanding beer coming in at 6.5% abv. Refreshingly fizzy, citrus, herbs and a gentle tartness it is a great summer beer. Located in Pipaix since 1769, it is Wallonie’s oldest brewery. The brewery is set amongst their impressive hop fields and has an enormous tasting cafe and restaurant. Being a public holiday it was rammed. No time to hang about though, brewery hunting to attend to.\n\nTiny Pipaix has another brewery. Saving the tiny Biset brewery from demolition, Jean-Louis and Sittelle Dits launched Brasserie a la Vapeur in 1984. Producing a range of beers in their steam-powered site, their 6% Saison is based on a recipe from 1785 and is much more amber in colour than some, with a strong tartness that compliments the spices and fruit nicely. Probably the most tart of the Saisons that I tasted and delicious.\n\nNext up was a drive to Tourpes and the brewery that produces what is regarded as the benchmark beer of this style, Saison Dupont. Founded in 1920, Dupont not only produces their flagship beer in its classic incarnation but also a dry-hopped version using different hops each year and an organic Saison Dupont Bio. Their other beers include the Moinette range and the outstanding and complex Bons Voeux. If that isn’t enough to whet your appetite, the brewery also produces a range of cheeses with beer-washed rinds. I was getting thirsty by now and stopped for a cheeky restorative at the welcoming Cafe Restaurant La Forge. Here I met one of the many brewery workers who use this lovely pub to re-hydrate after a hard day at the coal face. My new mate took me to nearby Aubechies, a beautifully serene village about five kilometeres away and home to the largest archaeological open-air museum in Belgium. The Taverne Saint Gery produces outstanding regional food and beers and features beer tastings each month from Dupont and Brasserie Des Carrieres Diole beers.\n\nMy next trip was to Ath, a good 45 minutes away. Here is located the former Brasserie des Geants, now Goliath. The 12th century Castle d’Irchonwelz has housed the brewery since 1997 where Saison Voisin, Gouyasse and Goliath beers are produced. The beers are named after the famed Giants of Ath. Giants are big (literally) in Tournai! In 2006 the brewery took over the Brasserie Ellezelloise, brewers of the fabulous Quintine beers and a new headquarters and distribution site has also been built just down the street from Goliath. Both breweries now form the Brasserie des Legendes.\n\nRight, I was now feeling somewhat thirsty so it was only natural to head across to my last brewery of the day. Silly is the site of its eponymous brewery, who have produced Silly Beer (honest!) since 1850. This being a public holiday, there was a handball game being played in the town square. Pretty serious stuff, players kitted out professionally and a big audience cheering on their heroes. I was delighted to discover that the brewery tap was open – hooray and it was definitely beer o’clock. Saison de Silly at 5% pours dark amber, has less tart notes but a far more pronounced caramel sweetness and fruit. 2 euros a glass too!\n\nA swift hour’s drive back to Tourai and it was time for a spot of sightseeing and bar hunting. Tournai is not typically referred to as a beer destination, more likely a beer desert but things are looking up. Following some research and tips from the local brewers I managed to enjoy both good and outstanding bars and satisfy my cravings for fresh Saison on tap. The city is indeed beautiful and was established before Roman times and even capital of the Frankish empire in the 5th century. The Grand Place doesn’t disappoint and is lined with numerous cafes and restaurants serving mainly established beer brands. I was on the hunt for something different and headed off to Quai du Marché aux Poissons on the banks of the River Scheldt (or Escaut or Schelde!). La Vie est Belge has a nice terrace overlooking the river and sells Dupont Bio but the rest of the list is made of standard fare.\n\nA few doors up the Quai is Le Bouchon, a quaint brown bar owned by Dominique Broutin. Here you can get a nice range of beers including local saisons – if a particular isn’t on the list its always worth asking what he has off-menu. Next door is the Bierodrome, also owned by Dominique. This is a new micro brewery/bottle shop/bar that is certain to be a huge success. Lots of ‘new world’ styles being brewed here.\n\nNot far from the Quai is the Place St Pierre. A neat little square tucked behind one of the main streets and the tourist office housing numerous cafes and restaurants for the younger, trendier Tournai locals. I did my best to fit in at the L’Hectolitre, a new and uber-trendy bar serving up an impressive beer list including Lupulus (Pierre Gobron, former owner of Achouffe), Dupont, Het Anker, De Fenicks, etc. Feeling more than a little out of my depth (old) I sauntered across to the Quai des Brumes on a corner of the Place. A great range of saisons can be found here including Saison Cazeau from Templeuve, which may be my new favourite Saison. Delicious at 5% and made with fresh elderflowers. The clientele here is more mature than at L’Hectolitre and quite varied -from a gang of bikers, to mature couples, to goths and even the guy who has had one too many.\n\nAfter a delicious Couscous Royale at Djerba on Rue du Marché au Jambon, who also have a couple of affordable Air BnBs upstairs it was time to bade Tournai goodnight and prepare myself for the last keg of my trip.\n\nAccueil\n\nAccueil\n\nhttp://www.brasserie-dupont.com\n\nhttp://www.brasseriedeslegendes.be\n\nhttp://silly-beer.com"
