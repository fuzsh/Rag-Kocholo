It is not only the capital but also the administrative and the most populous city in France. Paris also is the worldwide hub for fashion, art, culture, history and diversity. It is also famous for its unique landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre Museum. Read more to get to know more about what is the capital of France and all about this fascinating city full of life and vibrancy!\n\nCapital of France, Paris: The City of Light\n\nThe history of Paris is a rich history that spans over 2,000 years, and its cultural impact has reached global proportions, symbolising romance and elegance.\n\nIt all started as a modest Celtic village called Lutetia Parisiorum, located on the Île de la Cité, the island in the Seine now home to Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\nAs the Roman Empire expanded, Lutetia evolved into a significant city, featuring theatres, baths, and a marketplace. By the late 3rd century, it was renamed Paris, after the Celtic tribe, the Parisii, who had first settled there.\n\nIn the 5th century, as the Roman Empire began to decline, the Franks, a collection of Germanic tribes, took over the area.\n\nDuring this time, Clovis I made Paris his capital, initiating the Merovingian Dynasty and elevating the city to a position of national importance.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until the late 5th and early 6th century, under Clovis I’s rule, that Paris was officially declared the capital of France.\n\nBefore Clovis, the Merovingian kings did not have a permanent capital, but Clovis established his residence in Paris, effectively making it the capital.\n\nSince then, with a few breaks, Paris has remained the capital of France.\n\nIn recent times, Paris has seen major changes under the leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte and Baron Haussmann, who reorganized the city’s layout in the mid-19th century, creating the wide boulevards and the distinctive architectural style that is still seen today. Paris has also played key roles in both World Wars of the 20th century.\n\nThe city’s complex history is evident in its varied architecture, which includes styles from the Roman and Medieval periods to the Renaissance, Neoclassical, and contemporary eras. Each period has left its unique imprint on the city, weaving together a rich historical story.\n\nAlso Read: What Is The Capital City Of Telangana?\n\nGeography, Demography and Economy of Paris\n\nAs the political and economic centre of France, Paris is home to governmental bodies, like the French Parliament, the President’s residence (Élysée Palace), and various ministries.\n\nThe city is organized into neighbourhoods or arrondissements, each possessing its own distinct personality and allure.\n\nParis is renowned for its artistic and intellectual heritage, with the Louvre displaying some of the most celebrated artworks in the world.\n\nAdditionally, the city is a gastronomic paradise, offering fine French dishes in its numerous bistros and restaurants.\n\nParis is considered one of the world’s largest economies, ranking among the top cities globally because of its impact in areas such as politics, education, entertainment, media, fashion and the arts.\n\nThe city is internationally renowned for its high-end fashion, luxury goods, and cosmetics sectors.
