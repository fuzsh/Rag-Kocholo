        "text": "Beyond Franceâ€™s haute cuisine, there are its humble roots in cooking. Youâ€™ll know some of their more familiar items like the baguette or the croissant, and some you may not have known are originally French like brioche. Come along and find out why France has earned their crown as a leader in culinary and baking arts.\n\nWhile Paris may be the founding city for many of these baked goods, you can find high-quality pastries and bread all across France- and during that time explore their historical monuments and cultural museums. And if you canâ€™t make it there this summer, consider our bread, brioche, and pastries a little taste of France in the meantime. Bon appÃ©tit!"
