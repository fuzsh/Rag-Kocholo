        "text": "Here we go again in our series of \"What to do in ...? \"across Belgium. Finally thanks to these articles, you will soon know everything you need to do in our beautiful country! By the way, if you haven't read the others yet, we invite you to discover the big Belgian cities on our blog.\n\nAnyway, you are here to know the interesting spots and places to visit in Tournai, so let's get started right away.\n\nTournai Cathedral, Cathedral of Our Lady\n\nPlace de l'Evêché 7500 Tournai BE\n\nSo many adjectives make Cathedral of Our Lady a true jewel of medieval architecture. This masterpiece of Western art is the only Belgian cathedral on the UNESCO World Heritage List and traces the landscape of Tournai a few kilometres away. An important step to discover Tournai! Don't hesitate to go there to discover this monument that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe Tournai Belfry\n\n7500 België - Belgique - Belgien\n\nTo discover the magnificent panoramic view over the city of Tournai, you will have to climb 257 steps and above all a reservation must be made online in advance (family bubble, maximum 8 people). The Tournai belfry, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, is the oldest belfry in Belgium. It is a real watchtower from the 12th century, overlooking the Grand Place of Tournai from a height of 72 metres.\n\nPont des Trous\n\nQuai Donat Casterman 7500 Tournai BE\n\nWalking along the Scheldt, you will find the famous Hole Bridge, one of the most prestigious medieval architectural relics in Belgium (well, today you won't find much except cranes and workers). Built at the end of the 13th century, this lock was part of the second municipal wall of Tournai, with 18 gates and defending the Scheldt road through the city. The enormous gate can slide, preventing entry into the city via the Scheldt. From the outside, the tower is circular and is more resistant to shells. But nowadays, the bridge is being deconstructed to be completely rebuilt in this medieval style and to allow more river traffic by enlarging the central arch.\n\nGrand Place\n\nGrand Place 7500 Tournai BE\n\nDiscover one of the most beautiful and authentic main squares in the country! The triangular shape of this square makes it a must for tasting one of the classic Belgian dishes or a local beer. Did you know that Tournai holds the record for the number of catering establishments per inhabitant?\n\nMusée des Beaux-Arts Tournai\n\n7500 België - Belgique - Belgien\n\nThis building is the only museum ever designed by the architect Victor Horta, its original design was in the shape of a \"turtle\". Organised in chronological order (started in 1928, and his first project dates back to 1907), it is undoubtedly one of the first prototypes of a \"modern\" museum of international stature! So isn't that impressive?\n\nThe natural history museum\n\nRue Saint-Martin 52 7500 Tournai BE\n\nThe natural history museum is characterized by a living box, among live fish, tarantulas, amphibians and reptiles, these creatures evolve in reconstituted habitats. As a result, along with the glass caiman, the poisonous Amazon frog, the rare Egyptian sea turtle or the Jamaican python and other strange species, they are now threatened with extinction. The museum participates in the program for the protection and reproduction of endangered animals. The museum is a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums (E.A.Z.A.). The association brings together the largest zoos in Europe and its main task is to protect endangered animals through coordinated breeding programs and to raise public awareness of nature conservation.\n\nPicture @visittournai\n\nIf you want to visit all these places, download the Coddy application and play an escape game that will allow you to visit the city and have fun with your family or friends.
