If you'd asked me my favourite filmmaker (excluding dedicated horror directors) I'd have immediately said Luis Bunuel, but based purely upon his films made in Spain and France. In these ensuing years I've watched a number of Bunuel's Mexican films and been thrilled by them. They are all different; entertaining, imaginative, provocative ... surreal in moments and always rhythmic. Like the works of Jean Renoir in France and America, Bunuel's films are testament to the human spirit by way of encompassing human oddity.\n\nI've seen and enjoyed films directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, Rene Cardona, Carlos Reygadas, Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonson Cuaron in the modern era. I hope more Mexican films can gain official dvd releases with English subtitles so that film lovers can fully appreciate them.\n\nThanks.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nHi there petrolino ... Abismos de pasión (1954) was the eleventh of 20 films directed by Luis Buñuel in Mexico. His film is a Mexican set adaptation of Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë 1847. Abysses of Passion was a long-cherished project, the production being born of Buñuel's passion for the original text, and his own filmmaker's personal desire to adapt the story to screen.\n\nTrue to the spirit of the novel with expressive vigor, and intense emotion, Buñuel's version could be considered the best version of the novel ever made.\n\nDark and brooding the film's atmosphere is sincere and authentic, Buñuel brings to life the essential essence of the Gothic fiction. Despite his own misgivings over the finished project he said of the script it is \"one of the best scripts I have had in my hands\".\n\nFrom the onset it is an absorbing narrative, dramatically structured expressing abruptly and directly, as in the novel, the turmoil and inner feelings of the characters.\n\nWith exceptional deeply passionate performances, the story is portrayed in exquisite black and white cinematography, a compelling adult drama of outstanding quality...\n\nStruck by a re-watch the other night we followed with another of the 1939 version which I must admit pales in comparison to Abismos de pasión...\n\n.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nLa Otra (The Other) (1946) Dir. Roberto Gavaldón.\n\nReturning to Mexico from her Hollywood period, Dolores Del Rio plays twin sisters, the film’s central dual role, one as a meek, poverty-stricken manicurist and “the other” her wealthy socialite, man-eating sister. Unhinged and seething with jealousy, the manicurist…...\n\nConsidered one of the most important female figures in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Del Río was the first Mexican actress to succeed in Hollywood and has been recognized as one of the most beautiful actresses on screen of all time.\n\nDirector Roberto Gavaldón collaborated with his favourite screenwriter, José Revueltas, to create this distinctly Mexican melodramatic film noir. The film was based on an unproduced screenplay commissioned for Bette Davis, who eventually made her version in 1964: Dead Ringer, directed by Paul Henreid\n\nRoberto Gavaldón was one of the standout filmmakers of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, one of the supreme artists of melodrama. The work of the Mexican director is a highlight of Mexican national cinema, his films span the cultural divide embracing both rural sagas of peasant life and urban dramas focused on moneyed professionals. His protagonists are marked by ungovernable passions and gnawing self-doubt as they navigate through an unstable world, life inevitably spirals toward an unglamorous fate.\n\nLa Otra was his first big international hit for the director, he turns upside down the established, implacably virtuous persona of Mexico’s greatest and most glamorous star, Dolores del Río. Gavaldón demolished her untarnished aura of sanctity by casting del Rio as rival twin sisters. One of them poor and morally dubious; “the other” rich and selfishly depraved.\n\nGavaldón had a passion for melodrama and is known for being one of the pioneers of Film Noir in the country. A brilliant technician and artist, he developed a distinctive visual style, and complex story structure. With the assistance of regular collaborators, cinematographer Alex Phillips, the writer and political activist José Revueltas, and the composer Raúl Lavista, Gavaldón created a fascinating body of work that is only now slowly resurfacing and being rediscovered. In recent years festival retrospectives and special screenings have highlighted his work. The scarcity of good-quality subtitled prints limits availability for the home DVD collection, however some of his films are becoming available through various rare film sites.\n\nIn dispelling the widespread general misperception of Mexican films as primitive and undeveloped, undisputed is the fact that for two decades, the “Golden Age”, the Mexican industry was a serious global rival to Hollywood, Gavaldón among others was at the forefront of this creative rivalry.\n\nI never like comparisons but I think it is worth noting that the Mexican directors film noir stylings have been compared to those of Hollywood director Anthony Mann.\n\nOr could it be that Anthony Mann can be compared to Roberto Gavaldón? La Otra from 1946 is far more complex in narrative and visual style than anything Mann had done up until then, I suspect he may have been influenced with the moody atmospherics of La Otra for his Raw Deal in 1948….Highly Recommended !!\n\nAgustín Irusta as Roberto , Dolores del Río as María\n\nVíctor Junco as Fernando , Dolores del Río as María and Magdalena Méndez\n\nDirector Roberto Gavaldón in action...\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nJulio Bracho (1909–1978) Stylistically innovative Bracho was a master craftsman active throughout Mexico’s “Golden Age”, highly regarded he became one of the country's most commercially successful filmmakers.\n\nJulio Bracho’s versatility and creative artistry produced exceptional films in a number of styles and film genres. His first feature in 1941 Those Were The Days, Senor Don Simon! is a lively music-hall comedy that broke box-office records across the country. Of special interest are his melodramatic urban film noir’s such as Another Dawn (1943) and Twilight (1945). His film The Shadow of the Tyrant (1960), was a passion project it is a daring political thriller which was banned for over thirty years.\n\nHighly Recommended the Classic \"golden age\" cinema of Julio Bracho.\n\nDistinto amanecer , Another Dawn (1943) An excellent highly stylized, politicized antifascist film noir. With cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa and starring Pedro Armendáriz,\n\nCrepúsculo , Twighlight (1945) Arturo de Córdova and Gloria Marín star in this heated drama, a nocturnal noir of shadows and desire, one of Mexican cinema’s great films of the era tells the flashback tale of a doctor who fights an illicit, destructive passion for his best friend’s wife....\n\nGloria Marin as Lucia..."
