        "text": "For alternate versions of Human Torch, see Human Torch's Character Hub\n\n\"Suck it, Fox! I'm going to Disneyland!\"\n\nThe subject of this article appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but originates from another Marvel Comics adaptation. As this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki, please refrain from adding information not presented in a Marvel Cinematic Universe product. This universe is designated as \"Void Analyzing Fantastic Four\".\n\n\"Spoiler alert.\"\n\nWARNING! This article contains MAJOR SPOILERS for Deadpool & Wolverine. Keep reading this article at your own risk.\n\nAfter 30 days from the release of Deadpool & Wolverine, this notice may be removed.\n\nJonathan Lowell Spencer \"Johnny\" Storm was a member of the Fantastic Four known as Human Torch. He was pruned by the Time Variance Authority and sent to the Void, where he joined the Resistance opposing Cassandra Nova and her henchmen. Human Torch was captured along with Deadpool and Wolverine by a group of Nova's scavengers led by Pyro, who stripped Storm of his powers. When Deadpool openly mentioned Storm's vulgar comments about her, Nova brutally killed him.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nThe Fantastic Four[]\n\nFollowing a mission in space, Johnny Storm gained the power to manipulate and transform his body into fire, which granted him the ability to fly. Along with three others who also possessed unique powers, including Reed Richards, they formed a superhero team known as the Fantastic Four, with Storm going by the codename \"Human Torch.\"[2]\n\nBanished to the Void[]\n\nEncounter with the TVA[]\n\nAt some point, Human Torch had a run in with the Multiverse which resulted in him being taken by the Time Variance Authority, who pruned him, sending him to the Void, a place that Mister Fantastic had researched and expressed thoughts on. Human Torch was able to avoid being eaten by Alioth, but others he was with were not so fortunate.[2]\n\nJoining the Resistance[]\n\nHuman Torch came across a group of other heroes who had survived in the Void from Alioth. However, the wasteland was ruled by the mutant Cassandra Nova, who forced those trapped in the Void to work for her. This group of heroes, including Elektra, Blade, Gambit and X-23, rebelled against Nova and formed a Resistance, hiding out in the borderlands and trying to figure a way out of the Void. The Resistance spent years in hiding, and any attempt they made to fight Nova only ended in defeat.[2]\n\nMeeting Deadpool and Wolverine[]\n\nWhen Human Torch went out on a scout mission, he came across Deadpool and Wolverine, who were in the middle of fighting each other. Human Torch broke it up by telling them that fighting each other meant that they would lose and warned them that Cassandra Nova's crew was approaching their location. Jumping to the ground, Human Torch revealed himself, which excited Deadpool, who mistook him for a Variant of Steve Rogers.\n\nAs this happened, a convoy of Nova's henchmen led by Pyro surrounded the three. Human Torch told Deadpool and Wolverine that he would take care of them, much to Deadpool's awe. Pyro told Human Torch that there was nowhere for him to run, but he responded that he wasn't planning on running, calling him \"dick for brains.\" Believing Human Torch was about to utter Steve Rogers' signature phrase, Deadpool grew ever more giddy and prepared to say it along with him.\n\nTo Deadpool's surprise however, Human Torch uttered his own catchphrase and transformed into flame, soaring into the sky above everyone. Human Torch engaged Pyro, who quickly extinguished all of Human Torch's fire with his own powers, rendering Storm powerless as he fell out of the sky, striking some nearby structures along the way before falling unconscious. Upon seeing this, Deadpool and Wolverine immediately denied knowing Storm in any capacity.\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, Storm found himself caged alongside Deadpool and Wolverine to be taken to Nova's compound. Human Torch explained to the duo what the Void was, using Mister Fantastic's explanation to do so. He informed them about Alioth and the Resistance, so Wolverine thought the Resistance could help them get back to the TVA. However, Human Torch laughed at the idea, stating that whoever didn't get eaten by Alioth worked for Nova. Human Torch then spent the remainder of the trip expressing his hatred for Nova in extremely vulgar language, which he said he could be quoted on.[2]\n\nDeath[]\n\nArriving at the compound, Human Torch, Deadpool and Wolverine were let out of the cage and brought before Cassandra Nova, who remarked on how she had spent years trying to capture Human Torch.\n\nDeadpool interrupted, revealing to Nova what Human Torch had told them about her, although Human Torch tried to get Deadpool to stop talking at the risk of getting him killed. However, Deadpool continued and repeated exactly what Human Torch said to them verbatim. Human Torch attempted to deny it all, but Deadpool insisted on crediting Human Torch for his words. In a panic, Human Torch feverishly tried to deny insulting Nova, but she coldly used her powers to remove his skin in an instant, killing him.[2]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine were able to escape from Cassandra Nova's compound when Alioth arrived, and they later were brought to the Resistance Hideout by the Resistance. Deadpool rallied the group to launch an attack on Nova's compound in the hopes of using Nova to finally escape the Void, citing Human Torch's death as a reason. The Resistance was saddened to hear that Human Torch had been murdered, but Wolverine accused Deadpool of getting him killed, which the latter denied.\n\nThe attack was successful and Deadpool and Wolverine returned to the former's universe in time to stop Nova from using the Time Ripper to destroy all universes but the Void. Returning to the Time Variance Authority Office, Deadpool retrieved and played a tape taken from a hidden camera that was located in his cage. The tape showed Human Torch insulting and demeaning Nova using incredibly crude language, proving that he said the things Deadpool accused him of.[2]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nThis section needs a rewrite\n\nJohnny, much like the Captain America he was mistaken for, was heroic and leaderlike, quickly stopping Deadpool and Wolverine's fighting to remind them that they only had each other in the Void. He refused to work for the psychotic Cassandra Nova, becoming a member of the freedom-fighting Resistance instead. However, he was also sharp-tongued and abrasive, especially about Nova (who he harbored a deep hatred for), using extensive vulgar vocabulary to describe her and his wishes to kill her. Storm was so vulgar and offensive that even Deadpool, who often makes rude remarks, was surprised. Johnny's running his mouth was ultimately his undoing, as Cassandra Nova swiftly killed him after Deadpool repeated the obscenities he had used about her.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nFormer Powers[]\n\nSuperhuman Durability: To be added\n\nFire Manipulation: Human Torch had the power to manipulate fire, which formed around his body when he used his abilities. He could channel this fire in the form of blasts and beams.\n\nFlight: Human Torch could use this force to fly, which he did when battling Pyro. However, Pyro's own ability to manipulate fire negated Human Torch's abilities.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nTo be added\n\nEquipment[]\n\nFantastic Four Uniform: Storm wore a version of the Fantastic Four uniform in the Void, which is heat-resistant and does not melt even under high temperatures when Storm transforms into Human Torch.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllies[]\n\nFantastic Four - Former Teammates\n\nReed Richards/Mister Fantastic - Former Leader\n\nResistance - Teammates and Friends\n\nLaura/X-23\n\nElektra\n\nEric Brooks/Blade\n\nRemy LeBeau/Gambit\n\nErik Lehnsherr/Magneto †\n\nPeter Maximoff/Quicksilver †\n\nMatt Murdock/Daredevil †\n\nFrank Castle/Punisher †\n\nLogan/Wolverine\n\nEnemies[]\n\nTime Variance Authority\n\nCassandra Nova's Henchmen\n\nCassandra Nova † - Killer\n\nJohn Allerdyce/Pyro †\n\nVictor Creed/Sabretooth †\n\nMortimer Toynbee/Toad †\n\nAzazel †\n\nCallisto †\n\nCain Marko/Juggernaut †\n\nYuriko Oyama/Lady Deathstrike †\n\nBetsy Braddock/Psylocke †\n\nIvan/Russian †\n\nFred Dukes/Blob †\n\nPhilippa Sontag/Arclight †\n\nLester/Bullseye †\n\nQuill †\n\nWade Wilson/Deadpool - Former Ally\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the comics, Johnny Storm is a member of the Fantastic Four and brother of Sue Storm with the ability to generate fire throughout his body.\n\nBehind the Scenes[]\n\nHuman Torch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues the live-action incarnation of the character from 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four duology, who was also portrayed by Chris Evans; he is the second live-action incarnation of the character, following an incarnation portrayed by Jay Underwood.\n\nEvans agreed to reprise his role following a text from Ryan Reynolds asking if he'd be willing to. Evans later told Entertainment Weekly that Reynolds may be the only person he'd be willing to reprise the role for.[4]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
