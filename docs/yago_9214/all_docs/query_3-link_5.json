        "text": "Congratulations! Why did you make your film?\n\nI wanted to make a film that sheds light on what happens when we allow the government to consume us—everything from breaking apart families to deciding what an American should look, sound, and act like. Torch is that film.\n\nImagine I’m a member of the audience. Why should I watch this film?\n\nThis film is going to make you uncomfortable, but I hope it also makes you reflect on where you stand regarding the current political landscape. Plus, my high school students crewed this production, so you should support their efforts, too!\n\nHow do personal and universal themes work in your film?\n\nWithout giving it away, the themes of freedom, family, and justice are explored in this film. It's important to take a step back in our lives and consider the plights of others.\n\nHow have the script and film evolved over the course of their development?\n\nAlthough it's a short film, the script went through numerous drafts until every single word on the page was earned and then reviewed by industry professionals for punch and power. I truly believe that what is on the page is what you see; and of course, that vision came to life through the creativity and vision of my director, Ms Heather Hillstrom. She crushed it.\n\nWhat type of feedback have you received so far?\n\nPeople who have seen it describe it as powerful, topical, and shocking. The ending is also open to interpretation, so I get a lot of feedback from viewers who share what they think really happened. (SHHH! It's a secret!)\n\nHas the feedback surprised or challenged your point of view?\n\nI believe that art has the power to educate, inspire, entertain or enlighten; but a good piece of art can also turn the mirror inside. This is definitely not a \"feel good\" film, but I hope it will make viewers think and challenge their own beliefs. If that happens, then I have done my job as a writer and filmmaker.\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve by having your film more visible on www.wearemovingstories.com?\n\nI hope to raise the visibility of my film and garner support for female-centric production teams and projects. Plus, it would be great to find more opportunities to share my film with the world!\n\nWho do you need to come on board (producers, sales agents, buyers, distributors, film festival directors, journalists) to amplify this film’s message?\n\nAll of the above!\n\nWhat type of impact and/or reception would you like this film to have?\n\nI hope people are inspired to engage in tough conversations after watching this film and take action.\n\nWhat’s a key question that will help spark a debate or begin a conversation about this film?\n\nWhat does freedom look like? How do you know if you are free?\n\nWould you like to add anything else?\n\nThank you.\n\nWhat other projects are the key creatives developing or working on now?\n\nPersonally, I'm getting ready to pitch a YA pilot about immigration to streamers, and my director is producing several web series. We're both just trying to do Beyonce proud because 'who runs the world'? -Girls!"
