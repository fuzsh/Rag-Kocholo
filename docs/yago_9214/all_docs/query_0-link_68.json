        "text": "Plot summary\n\nThe Mexican revolutionary General Jose Juan Reyes (Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz) and his men descend upon and take over the small town of Cholula, Puebla, and take the money of the rich men of the zone for the Mexican Revolution. The revolutionary is a Robin Hood type vigilante that forces the local businessmen to bend to his will, while the townspeople admire him for his cause. Jose Juan falls in love with the SeÃ±orita PeÃ±afiel, the explosive daughter of the richest man of the zone. Despite her disdain for Jose, he pursues her romantically. She is eventually won over. The original script is based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew."
