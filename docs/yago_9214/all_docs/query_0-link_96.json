        "text": "Yesterday’s viewing, today!\n\n9.00 am PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID — this new restoration looked and sounded splendid. It’s essentially the Paul Seydor cut as far as I can see — a version some have a few issues with..\n\nThis time round I was keeping in mind what’s written in If They Move… Kill ‘Em! about Peckinpah getting cold feet and inventing the scene of Paco (Emilio Fernandez) getting tortured and killed to motivate, in the most conventional way, Billy’s decision not to leave for Mexico. Rudy Wurlitzer’s script had eschewed such melodramatics and morality. The addition of this scene creates narrative nonsense — Poe, one of the men on Billy’s trail, has just learned that Billy is in Old Fort Sumner. Then the Paco scene shows that he ISN’T in Fort Sumner, and shows him deciding to go there. Was Poe’s informant psychic?\n\nIn a world of unlimited versions of PGABTK one could envision a Rudy Wurlitzer Cut, where the Paco scene is harmlessly dropped. It would be, I think, just as valid as Seidor’s improvements — which is to say, it might make the film better in some respects, but in other respects it wouldn’t be Peckinpah’s total vision.\n\nToday I’ll be seeing editor/director Roger Spottiswoode talk about his career, including this film. Maybe I can get his thoughts on the restoration. As I say, it’s visually and aurally stunning, and the film definitely communicates with the force Peckinpah intended.\n\nWe got out of the Peckinpah and joined the queue to go back into the same cinema for DESTRY RIDES AGAIN — a line circling the block, something none of us had ever seen in Bologna. And of course, that was a fun time. I wondered how the two flavours of western might clash, but it was fine, just fine. DRA is George Marshall’s only great feature, it seems. I can’t quite work out why he couldn’t repeat the magic elsewhere, the film certainly seems imbued with a distinctive personality (including the influence of his days with Laurel & Hardy).\n\nThen I saw Marco Bellocchio talk, along with two episodes of French cinema programme L’Image Originalle, one on MB the other on David Lynch. The show looks at filmmakers’ oeuvres through the lens of their first features, so FISTS IN THE POCKET and ERASERHEAD. A really neat idea. I just watched FITP before coming out here, so I was nicely primed. Bellocchio is remarkable, and he seems to be enjoying his late-career success.\n\nHe was on hand again to introduce 1972’s SBATTI IL MOSTRO IN PRIMA PAGINA (SLAP THE MONSTER ON PAGE ONE), a smart, tough, wickedly funny newspaper drama with typically excellent work from Gian Maria Volonte’ and Laura Betti. But then I skipped out of the Bellocchio interview, because I’d seen him twice at this point and the translations make everything a bit long. I figured some time in the open air and a leisurely meal would set me up nicely to watch ORDET.\n\nI’d made a ridiculous schoolboy error, though, because this wasn’t ORDET, or rather it was Gustav Molander’s ORDET, not CT Dreyer’s. And it seemed perfectly fine, but as with PENSION MIMOSAS the day before, I found I couldn’t get into it.\n\nSo I ducked out and caught some of the carbon arc projections in the Piazzetta. I’ve been starved of the earlies this trip, so this was just what I needed — acrobatics, actualities, and the familiar but always surprising and welcome sight of boulevardier Dranem defecating in a phone booth. All on a balmy night in Bolognia with live music. Bliss.\n\nSo, we finally caught up with THE EMPTY MAN which seemed like it would be our bag, but kind of wasn’t, not entirely. And we also watched TALK TO ME, which totally impressed us. It became our bag whether we wanted it to be or not.\n\nWe absolutely loved David Prior’s episode of Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities so our hopes were high for TEM. All through the long pre-title sequence we were riveted. Then we got less and less involved as the film began showing its influences, and seemed increasingly removed from real life. (A ghost story should touch reality in 100 places, argued Henry James.)\n\nThe film has a fairly interesting structure, with the prologue crashing into the main body of the film a la EXORCIST (Bhutan here = Iraq) and key story elements revealed in flashback. From RINGU it borrows the very effective trope of the supernatural investigation being rendered urgent by a ticking clock curse — the Bad Thing that will get you if you don’t find the truth in time, and maybe even if you do.\n\nUnfortunately the use of VHS tapes in a cabin as backstory infodump tips the hat too overtly to that source, and the green light and glitching are too Fincheresque (Prior collaborated with Fincher on his Voir video essay series for Netflix, and got his start making behind-the-scenes extra feature for DF). And the horror honk needs to be retired as a soundtrack device. Elsewhere there’s an impulse towards the Lynchian, but Lynch is really hard to imitate — I think the sensibility has to be FELT. Likewise, Fincher comes by his style honestly, and what works brilliantly for him is less successful for a mere imitator.\n\nThe one really original discovery is how scary BRIDGES can be.\n\nPrior composes really well, though, his movement of characters into and out of the frame is constantly sharp and does feel original. The talent is there, he just seems to need to get away from conventional plot beats and explore things he has a personal connection to — the traumatic backstory stuff here is particularly tired and fails to move.\n\nLeading man James Badge Dale is perfectly OK, but the film’s own emptiness hinders him, and I can see why Prior has turned to F. Murray Abraham and Glynn Turman for his CoC episode — when you have great actors, everything just gets better. (When Phoebe Nicholls turns up as a scary nurse, everything in TEM DOES get better, including Dale.)\n\nShe was Merrick’s mom in THE ELEPHANT MAN!\n\nAs part of the film’s nicely modular structure, there’s a teen horror movie buried inside the middle-aged detective story, an urban legend bit of spookiness that’s fun if derivative. (The film DOES manage strong suspense and anxiety, but it’s purely technical — we never care about anyone in it.) TALK TO ME is entirely a teen urban legend horror story, but for once the teenagers feel credible.\n\nI guess both films deal with teenage recklessness — blowing on an empty bottle found on a bridge to summon the Empty Man, who will kill you, is a stupid thing to do, but as a test of courage it does feel like something teens might do. Grasping a porcelain hand and inviting the spirits of the dead to possess you, as happens in TTM, is equally dumb — but no dumber than imbibing illicit substances of uncertain provenance and strength.\n\nWhat elevates TALK TO ME is not just a matter of style — though directors Danny & Michael Philippou wield their tricks with great flare, and they’re integrated into story and character so that they never feel like indulgent showing off. The performances are FANTASTIC — I’ll even take the muffled mumblecore quality of the dialogue, because the film gains so much from its sense of believability. You don’t want anyone to enunciate even 1% more than they would normally, and spoil the illusion.\n\nIt would seem sound to shoot the naturalistic performances in an artless mockumentary fashion, but instead the filmmakers make sophisticated use of long takes, elegant transitions, and following shots that keep us glued to the characters. Sophie Wilde is a star.\n\nThe film speaks to real human experience not in spite of the fantasy element, but through it — this is a neat trick, and one that may be impossible to learn. Unquestionably the filmmakers have picked up a lot of knowledge of cinema by seeing stuff and analysing it, but what makes the film really interesting is the sense that they understand and care about their characters, and really know them on a deep level, and have encouraged their actors to do likewise. And they’ve really cast this thing well, down to the smallest part. What is it about Australian actors these days? I guess they’ve always been good, at least since the seventies, but is it maybe some combination of traditions? British technique plus American honesty and naturalism? But maybe we should just call it Australian excellence. It’s all over this film.\n\nTHE BEAR’S WEDDING deals with maternal influence, the Victorian idea that the experiences of a pregnant woman could affect her offspring — a sort of anticipation of modern epigenetics, but a discredited idea that’d make a good subject for Dario Argento (extra Y chromosome causes psychopathy; the murder victim’s eye records the last thing they saw; he loves his outmoded medical theories).\n\nSee also THE ELEPHANT MAN, in which Lynch chooses to assume that John (really Joseph) Merrick believes the (fictitious) showman’s account of his origin story (“Struck down in the fourth month of her maternal condition by a rampaging African elephant…”) His family did seem to accept this explanation, per Wikipedia.\n\nTBW (Medvezhya svadba) is a 1925 Soviet historical pageant in which the protagonist’s mother gets traumatized by a bear which kills her husband, and he grows up with wild, violent moods “when the forest is full of noise.”\n\nI’m struck by the resemblance to CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF here. But COTW is one of those weird Hammer films that begins decades early and takes forever to reach its actual storyline (see also the pathetic CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT). TBW brings its bipolar protag within the first nine minutes, and demonstrates that this approach CAN work if you’re reasonably brisk about it.\n\nKonstantin Eggert and Vladimir Gardin directed, very effectively, and the production design is rich and atmospheric. I love the huge bed.\n\nThis is how the filmmakers show the young hero, as a boy, being influenced by the malign bible stories he’s told:\n\nReally good!\n\nElsewhere, admittedly, the filmmakers’ attempts at a montage style falters slightly because the shots are too wide, too neutral, to do the Eisenstein thing, which requires intense compositions carefully designed to clash dramatically, each with the other. This is just a bunch of long shots cut unpleasantly fast. I appreciate tight pacing, but the footage and story often seem more suited to a slow, atmospheric approach.\n\nA real coup de cinema — our hero comes to his senses and realises he’s mauled his loved one to death — he retreats — the extremely long bedclothes wrapped about him are gradually pulled away from the slain, woman, revealing the tragedy, as he sinks into a dark and blurry background, a vivid picturization of the internal horror.\n\nThe film is full of striking visual ideas. The requisite torch-wielding villagers are portrayed first through a sedate darkened archway, but as more join the hint, the screen is filled with flames and becomes a hellish abstract.\n\nFrequently the film achieves this — not quite enough to reach Eisensteinian montage, but enough to be inspirational — a modern filmmaker could steal these effects and look good doing it.\n\nAn exciting film which plays like a commie Hammer flick — and illuminates the ways in which Hammer films, with all those depraved aristos, are open to sinister left-wing interpretations, heh heh."
