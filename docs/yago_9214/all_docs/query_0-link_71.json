        "text": "Between 1945 and 1947 Emilio Fernandez, the director ofclassics like Maria Candelaria (1943a) and Flor Silvestre (1943b) and Mexico's most significant auteur, made two films with Hollywood studio RKO: La perla/ Pearl (l946a) and The Fugitive (Ford1948a). Through analysis of these films and their production context,as well as insights gained from the production files, this article will attempt to shed new light on the role Fernandez and these inter-American films played both in Hollywood's postwar mission in the United States, Mexico and Latin America and in Mexico's own national industry.\n\nCourse summary: This course examines race and ethnicity, and processes of racialised and ethnic exclusion, in Latin America in historical perspective. It invites us to consider the historical role played by race and ethnicity in hierarchically structuring Latin American societies and reproducing patterns of exclusion from full citizenship in a number of contrasting case studies from the wars of independence until c. 1950. Among some of the topics to be considered are: the role of Afro-descendants and the indigenous peoples in the region's independence from Spain and Portugal, the persistence of slavery in Brazil and Cuba in a context shaped by ostensibly liberal ideas and the role of slavery and emancipation, and of the Haitian revolution, in configuring ideas about race as well as racial hierarchies in the region, the so-called Indian question and its place in liberal thought in the nineteenth century, debates over desirable and non-desirable immigration and on immigration's impact on the 'racial stock', the adoption and adaptation of scientific racism and eugenics by Latin American thinkers as well as the critiques that such approaches to race engendered, the rise and demise of 'indigenista' and mestizaje ideas, policies, and cultural expressions in both Mesoamerica and the Andes, the development of the notion of 'racial democracy' in post-slavery Brazil and Cuba and of 'whiteness' in the Southern Cone and their role in shaping racialized social policies. More generally, the course considers the ideological and practical construction of 'racial states' throughout Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."
