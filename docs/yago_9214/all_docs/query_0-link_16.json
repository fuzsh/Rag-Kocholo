        "text": "An average romance which has a touch of comedy in its portrayal of a Mexican town overrun by revolutionary Armendariz and his men. Many of the townsfolk don't like the general, while others do their best to please him. Armendariz falls in love with Goddard, the daughter of the village's richest man, and eventually proves to her that he's worthy of her. Sharp photography helps the weak script. This was a remake of ENAMORADA (1946), a Mexican production which was also directed by Fernandez."
