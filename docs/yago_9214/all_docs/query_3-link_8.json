        "text": "This documentary centered on the blues musician Buddy Guy is a very good rather than a great movie. But any opportunity to spend almost two hours in the company of Buddy Guy is an opportunity not to be missed.\n\nDirected by Jim Farrell, “The Torch” takes an unusual tack. It’s as much about Guy’s sense of mission as it is about his stunning musicianship. It begins with Guy on acoustic guitar, singing of how his mother identified him as a blues man when he was only 2 years old. Then we’re at Guy’s Chicago nightclub, Legends, following a young man into the club. He appears to be a fan, but he’s there to play. He’s Quinn Sullivan, a youthful protégé of Guy’s. He’s one of several musicians to whom Guy is passing the torch of the movie’s title.\n\nGuy tells stories of his early years across Louisiana and in Chicago. Practically starving as he tries to find work, he is introduced to the singer-songwriter Muddy Waters, who gives him a ride around town, during which Waters offers Guy bread and salami as they drive. Realizing he’s going to play with one of his heroes, Guy’s hunger seems to disappear.\n\nThen there’s the footage of Sullivan’s white, middle-class upbringing. The guitarist has real talent but might be considered by some lacking in the blues-as-lived-experience department, since it is a Black musical tradition. This doesn’t concern Guy, who is Black; and race is never once mentioned verbally. Instead, as onscreen interviews with musicians such as Carlos Santana, Joe Bonamassa and others underscore, the bottom line is what you give to the music. Depicted here in appearances before the pandemic, Guy, who is in his 80s, still gives his all, combining soul and virtuosity with off-the-wall showmanship.\n\nThe Torch\n\nNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes. In theaters and available to rent or buy on Apple TV, Google Play and other streaming platforms and pay TV operators."
