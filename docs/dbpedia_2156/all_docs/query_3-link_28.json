        "text": "Intro\n\nMarie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1798 – 1870), better known by the title Duchess of Berry, was the wife of Charles Ferdinand d’Artois, Duke of Berry (murdered in 1820), second son of King Charles X of France, and the mother of Count de Chambord, a legitimist pretender to the French throne under the name ‘Henry V’.\n\nOn behalf of her son, she tried unsuccessfully to seize power in France in 1832 as ‘regent’. She was the cause of the last uprisings in the Vendée and Chouannes in north-west France in May and June 1832.\n\nImprisoned and then deported to Palermo, she was kept away from the royal family. Marie Caroline married a second time to Ettore Lucchesi-Palli, with whom she had four more children.\n\nFamily\n\nPrincess Marie Caroline of Naples and Sicily was born at the Royal Palace of Caserta, in the Kingdom of Naples, on 5 November 1798.\n\nGranddaughter of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Queen Maria Carolina of Austria, she was the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Francis, Duke of Calabria, and Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, daughter of Emperor Leopold II and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain.\n\nTimes of war\n\nThe same year of the Princess’s birth, the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily joined the Second Coalition. The French army, commanded by General Championnet, entered the Kingdom and established a Parthenopean Republic on 21 January 1799. Defeated, the royal family boarded a British ship commanded by Admiral Nelson and took refuge in Palermo.\n\nThe princess spent her childhood in Palermo and Naples, where the royal family returned on 31 January 1801. In 1801, the princess lost her mother. Her father, who had no sons, remarried the following year to Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain to ensure the succession to the throne.\n\nDefeated again by the French troops of General Masséna, the royal family left Naples for Sicily in 1806, while the French Emperor entrusted the Kingdom of Naples to his brother Joseph Bonaparte and then to his brother-in-law Joachim Murat.\n\nThe princess received a fairly free education, indulged in popular songs in Italian dialect, and devoted herself particularly to painting.\n\nWhile her aunt Maria Amalia married the Duke of Orléans in exile in 1809, Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, a second cousin of the princess, married Napoleon I in 1810, much to the regret of her grandmother, Queen Maria Carolina, who died in Austria in 1814.\n\nRestoration and marriage\n\nThe fall of the French Empire allowed King Ferdinand to regain the Neapolitan throne, despite the resistance and intrigues of Joachim Murat, who was shot in 1815. The House of Bourbon also regained the French throne and the former Count of Provence, brother of Louis XVI, became king with the name Louis XVIII.\n\nThe succession to the throne, which the French princes had regained after twenty-five years of exile, had to be secured quickly. The king, a widower, had no children and was reluctant to remarry at the age of 60. His brother and heir had two sons, but neither of them had children. The younger son had many mistresses and is said to have married a young English woman in exile, by whom he had two daughters. As the young woman was not of royal blood, the marriage was annulled and the prince set free. It was to this nephew, Charles Ferdinand of Artois, that the king entrusted the task of providing successors to the throne.\n\nThe royal family of Naples was a younger branch of the House of Bourbon and the king of France chose the eldest of the king’s granddaughters, Marie Caroline, who was 18 years old at the time, small in stature, with her mother’s long face and Hapsburg lip. Her beautiful blue eyes were slightly squinting but her charm and cheerfulness made her delightful. She was vital and sparkling.\n\nPrincess Marie Caroline thus came to France in May 1816 to marry Charles Ferdinand d’Artois, Duke of Berry, second son of the future Charles X, brother of King Louis XVIII. Their marriage by proxy took place in Naples on 14 April 1816. She landed in Marseilles on 30 May 1816, where she was quarantined to prevent the plague, then travelled through France.\n\nAt each stop, Marie Caroline received a letter from Charles and at each stop a letter left for him. The tone changed from letter to letter: no longer ‘Monsignor’ nor ‘Madame’, but little by little, Marie Caroline and then just Caroline. On 12 June, Charles wrote to her: ‘I wish to see you, my Caroline…. My heart beats and I believe it will beat much faster when my lips press against your beautiful cheeks‘.\n\nTheir first meeting took place at the Château de Fontainebleau on 15 June 1816, while the wedding took place two days later in the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.\n\nAlthough her husband was twenty years older than her and the marriage had been arranged, it seems that the two formed quite a close couple but the incorrigible Charles did not give up his mistresses.\n\nThere was Virginie Oreille, the beautiful dancer at the opera, but also Marie-Sophie Delaroche, who bore him a son named Ferdinand in 1817, and Louise Barré, daughter of a clerk at the duke’s hunting lodge, who gave birth to a little girl he dared to call Caroline! Finally, there was the English mistress, Amy Brown, who bore him two daughters and whom he moved to Paris.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess de Berry had four children, only two of whom survived beyond their early days:\n\nLouise Marie-Thérèse d’Artois, their third child, born in Paris on 21 September 1819, was called Mademoiselle and in 1830 was given the title of Comtesse de Rosny; on 10 November 1845 she married the man who became Duke of Parma on 4 March 1849 with the name Charles III and Prince of Lucca, by whom she had four children; after the murder of her husband in 1854 and a period of regency, she was driven from the duchy in 1859 by an insurrection and died in Venice on 1 February 1864.\n\nHenri d’Artois (1820-1883), Duke of Bordeaux, ‘Comte de Chambord‘, born in September 1820 at the Tuileries Palace in Paris, died in Frohsdorf in 1883. Henry was born after the death of his father, the Duke of Berry, who was stabbed to death on 13 February 1820 while accompanying his wife to her carriage outside the Royal Academy of Music in Paris.\n\nCaroline was then pregnant with their fourth child, Henry, who was nicknamed the ‘miracle child‘ as his birth continued the direct line of the Bourbons from King Louis XIV of France.\n\nAt the French court\n\nAfter the murder of her husband, the Duchess of Berry moved to the Tuileries. Her temperament was quite the opposite to that of the austere Duchesse d’Angoulême, her sister-in-law and cousin twenty years her senior, who had endured sufferings that the young Marie Caroline had not experienced, having been born after the Terror. Indeed, Caroline was not very attached to etiquette, she loved to entertain and was fashion-conscious.\n\nWith the birth of her son, Caroline rediscovered her taste for life. She changed the decor of her flats in the Tuileries and launched new fashions: cashmere shawls, shorter dresses to show off her adorable little feet, hats covered in ostrich feathers to compensate for her small size.\n\nA lover of travel and new experiences, Marie Caroline liked to get away from the capital frequently. She played an important role in launching the English fashion of sea bathing in France, particularly in Boulogne-sur-Mer and Dieppe, the first French seaside resort, around 1820. She loved this recreational activity in the summer months and made it popular with the royal court and the French bourgeoisie. She also enjoyed going out to sea and owned a boat dedicated to this purpose, Le Furet, painted by the painter Louis Ambroise Garneray in 1827 and exhibited in the Dieppe museum. Occasionally she took the opportunity to visit other cities, such as Le Havre in July 1824. She also inaugurated a section of the Somme Canal.\n\nInsurrection of 1832\n\nIn 1824 Louis XVIII died and was succeeded by Charles X, father-in-law of Caroline. Charles X’s accession to the throne began with a coronation in Reims, similar to that of Louis XVI. This inappropriate pomp did not improve the popularity of the new sovereign. He is indeed a conservative king: he relies on the Church and authorises the return of the Jesuits. He has his ‘old ideas’ and does not abandon them.\n\nWith the July Revolution of 1830, Charles X was overthrown. Both Charles and his eldest son abdicated but his cousin Louis Philippe d’Orléans did not proclaim Henry king. Instead, Louis Philippe allowed the Chamber of Deputies to declare himself king. Caroline and Henry then went into exile with Charles and his family to Bath in England and then to the Palace of Holyrood in Scotland.\n\nCaroline, however, did not accept her son’s exclusion from the throne by the orléanist ‘King of the French’. Instead, she declared her son legitimate king and herself regent.\n\nIn 1831, she surrounded herself with determined legitimists such as Ferdinand de Bertier, Bourmont, Florian de Kergorlay, the Duc d’Almazan and the Duc de Blacas, who worked with her to define a political programme with a view to the restoration of the major branch, the Edict of Reform of the Kingdom. According to Bertier: ‘The broadest and most liberal ideas, those most favourable to the people and at the same time most in keeping with the glory and greatness of France, formed the basis of this programme‘.\n\nIn the summer of 1831, the Duchess travelled to Italy; in constant correspondence with the legitimists, she prepared a double insurrection that would take place in Marseille and the Vendée. In Italy, she stayed first in Genoa, where she received the support of the King of Sardinia, Charles Albert, only in a private capacity; in Naples, at the home of her brother, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies; and in Rome, where the Pope prudently avoided publicly expressing his support.\n\nFrom August 1831, she received hospitality in the ducal palace in Massa and the support of Duke Francis IV of Modena, the only sovereign in the region to refuse to recognise the July monarchy. In January 1832, she set up a committee in The Hague to establish ties with King William I of Holland, who opposed Louis Philippe’s Belgian policy.\n\nOn 26 April 1832, she embarked with some of her followers on a steamship and disembarked near Marseilles during the night of 28-29 April. Instead of the insurrection of two thousand people she had announced, she managed to mobilise only sixty men. Unable to take control of the town hall in Marseilles, she decided to leave directly for the Vendée. There she tried to revive the Vendée wars and mobilise the population to her cause. Local mobilisation was rather weak and the operation quickly failed.\n\nAfter six months on the run, the duchess found refuge in the house of Mlles Duguigny in Nantes, located at 3 rue Haute-du-Château (today rue Mathelin-Rodier) opposite the castle of the Dukes of Brittany, but was betrayed by Simon Deutz. After hiding all night with her supporters in a small room behind a fireplace, when her house was surrounded by the gendarmerie, she had to come out of the fireplace when a fire was lit by the gendarmes on duty. Handed over to General Dermoncourt, who guaranteed her safety, she was arrested on 7 November 1832.\n\nHeld in the citadel of Blaye and under the strictest surveillance, she gave birth to a daughter named Anne Marie Rosalie on 10 May 1833 before witnesses appointed by Marshal Bugeaud at the request of Louis-Philippe.\n\nThe princess later declared that in 1831 she had secretly married Ettore Lucchesi-Palli (1808-1864), chamberlain to the King of the Two Sicilies and future Duke of Grace, and that he was the child’s legitimate father, but doubts remain as to the paternity. Little Rosalie died after six months and was buried in the Lucchesi-Palli tomb in Naples. The duchess later had three more daughters and a son by her new husband. Her direct descendants thus comprised six children – out of the ten born – two by the Duke of Berry and four by Ettore Lucchesi-Palli.\n\nMarie Caroline, who had French nationality from her marriage to the Duke of Berry, lost it by remarrying an Italian and was therefore no longer fit to fulfil the role of regent. No longer an object of fear for the French government, she was released in June 1833.\n\nThe old king was adamant: for him, Madame Lucchesi-Palli was no longer tutor or regent for the Duke of Bordeaux and his sister. The children were entrusted to the Duchess of Angoulême. Of course she will be able to see them again but briefly and in the presence of a third party. Of course they will be able to write to each other but she fears for her son’s education. She fears that her sister-in-law will turn him into someone as narrow-minded as Charles X. She understands everything. This is what will happen. Meanwhile Chateaubriand summarises the situation as follows: ‘Caroline chooses to be the happy Countess Lucchesi-Palli rather than the unfortunate mother of Henry V‘.\n\nIndeed, Marie Caroline loves her husband, whom she calls ‘Pacha’. They will have four children who will fill them with happiness and give them 28 grandchildren!\n\nThe Duchess of Berry and the arts\n\nThe Duchess was interested in many artistic fields and had a regular painter in the person of Hortense Haudebourt-Lescot. Like her husband, who presided over the Société des Amis de l’Art, the princess was a great patron of the arts, encouraging many painters through her numerous purchases at the Salons and promoting the artistic and literary production of a large number of musicians and men of letters.\n\nShe also actively sponsored many factories, trading houses and craft workshops, with the aim of promoting the economic development of the country.\n\nLess well known, however, is her extreme generosity – she was nicknamed ‘the good duchess‘ – demonstrated by the very active support she gave throughout her life, even in exile, to numerous organisations and associations, as well as to victims of natural disasters, the needy and former servants of the monarchy.\n\nShe was a patron of many musicians, including Rossini and Boieldieu, who dedicated his opera La Dame blanche to her.\n\nIn her Château de Rosny, the Duchess of Berry put together one of the most extraordinary libraries of her time, both for the rarity of the editions it contained and the high quality of the bindings. This magnificent collection of more than 8,000 volumes was dispersed in 1837 in a sale that lasted more than one month, with the result that her hand-bound books appeared in the sales of major European libraries.\n\nPassionate about theatre, she obtained from Louis XVIII the patronage of the Théâtre du Gymnase which, from 1825, assumed the title of ‘Théâtre de Madame‘, Madame being the name traditionally given to the first princess of the kingdom after the Dauphine, a name she had managed to impose as mother of the future heir to the French throne.\n\nDuring her stay in Italy, the duchess became particularly interested in photography. She was in contact with photographers who lived in Rome and formed the Caffè Greco circle.\n\nThe gardens\n\nLike Empress Josephine, the Duchess was a passionate botanist and completely renovated the park of Château de Rosny in the style of ‘English landscape gardening’, very much in vogue at the time.\n\nShe had it filled with thousands of species of trees, shrubs and flowers and populated it with deer and fallow deer.\n\nIn memory of her great-aunt, Queen Marie Antoinette, she had an ‘English river’ created in the park, with an artificial waterfall in the spirit of the one the sovereign had created at the Petit Trianon in Versailles. Finally, to satisfy her passion for exotic flowers, she created a vast warm greenhouse.\n\nThe end\n\nAfter losing her daughter, the Duchess of Parma, and her second husband (who had ruined her financially) within two months of each other in 1864, she moved to Austria, where she spent her last years between Brunnsee Castle and Venice. There she had bought the Vendramin palace, which her son Henry d’Artois had her sell in exchange for his financial help. She died blind in Brunnsee Castle on 16 April 1870.\n\n“The great deserted house of Brunnsee is like a beach at low tide. Life has withdrawn, like the sea, from these half-furnished rooms where a few relics still remain, vestiges of a vanished happiness. A very old woman, thickened and sagging, stands in front of the window and flips through a photo album all day long (where) almost blind, she struggles to recognise the features of faces she once knew‘ (Laure Hillerin).\n\nFor further reading"
