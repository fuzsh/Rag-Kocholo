        "text": "Ferdinand-Louis-Philippe-Charles-Henri, duke d’Orléans (born Sept. 3, 1810, Palermo—died July 13, 1842, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Fr.) was the son of Louis-Philippe of France, who succeeded to the title of duc d’Orléans when his father became king (1830).\n\nHe was a noted soldier and served in Algeria from 1834 to 1836. In 1837 he married Princess Helena of Mecklenburg. In 1839 he again went to Algeria, but the fatigues of the campaign were too much for him. He died at Neuilly at the age of 31. His sons refused the title of duc d’Orléans: Philippe (1838–94) became comte de Paris (see Paris, Philippe d’Orléans, comte de); Robert (1840–1910) became duc de Chartres. Philippe’s eldest son, also named Philippe (1869–1926), was the last duc d’Orléans, dying without issue."
