        "text": "Henri-Eugène-Philippe-Louis d’Orléans, duke d’Aumale (born Jan. 16, 1822, Paris, France—died May 7, 1897, Zucco, Sicily, Italy) was the fourth son of King Louis-Philippe of France, a colonialist, and a leader of the Orleanists, supporters of constitutional monarchy.\n\nOrléans entered an army career at age 17 and distinguished himself in Algerian campaigns; in 1847 he became lieutenant general and governor of France’s African possessions. An exile in England after the Revolution of 1848, he returned to France in 1871 and served as an Orleanist deputy. In 1873 he presided at the trial of General Achille Bazaine. Retiring from public life in 1883, he spent the rest of his life in research and writing."
