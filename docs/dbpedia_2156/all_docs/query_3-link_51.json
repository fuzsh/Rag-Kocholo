        "text": "Philip Mansel\n\nThe entry of the Duc dâAngoulÃªme into Bordeaux on 12 March 1814, amid applauding crowds, three weeks before the deposition of Napoleon I in Paris, was not only a rare success for the Ã©migrÃ© government of Louis XVIII but also the only time in French history that a change of regime started in a provincial city. It suggests that the history of cities and diasporas can be as important as national histories. Louis XVIII later called it âthe happiest event of my lifeâ.1 On 29 September 1820, he named the heir to his throne, the posthumous son of his murdered nephew the Duc de Berry, notâlike previous Bourbon heirsâDuc de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, but Duc de Bordeaux.2 The economic factors behind Bordeauxâs welcome to AngoulÃªme were confirmed by the words on a banner at a reception at the Chambre de Commerce in Bordeaux to honour the birth: âillo duce, quo non commercium?â [âWith him as Duke, where will trade not reach?â].3\n\nIn the eighteenth century, thanks above all to the sugar, slave and wine trades with the Caribbean, England and the Baltic, Bordeaux had become the first port of France. The splendour of the quays and the Place Royale, constructed in 1743â1747, and of the Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre from 1773 to 1780, is a tribute to its prosperity. The English economist Arthur Young wrote in 1787: âmuch as I had read and heard of the commerce, wealth and magnificence of this city, they greatly surpassed my expectations ... the theatre ... is by far the most magnificent in France. At Bordeaux they think it [the French commercial treaty of 1786 with England] a wise measure that tends equally to the benefit of both countriesâ.4 His words help explain the popularity of the Bourbons in Bordeaux in 1814. They were more than a dynasty. They were symbols of peace and prosperity.\n\nBordeaux was also distinguished by the number and prominence of foreign merchants, often of English or Irish extraction, and sometimes Protestants. Some names are still famous in the wine trade: Hennessy, MacCarthy, Lynch.5 Bordeaux belonged to France, but also to Europe and the Atlantic. For Bordeaux as for many other French cities, the revolution was an economic catastrophe. The population fell from 100,000 to 60,000. A third of the houses were empty. The foreigners left. After 1806 Napoleonâs continental blockade worsened the situation. The French economy, and above all French ports, entered into a slump.6 Bordeaux was ready for change.\n\nIn preparing the royalist journÃ©e of 12 March 1814, the three key characters were an Ã©migrÃ©, the Duc dâAngoulÃªme, nephew of Louis XVIII; a Bordelais and former Ã©migrÃ©, Count Lynch; and a British general, the Duke of Wellington. Born in 1775, elder son of the Comte dâArtois, AngoulÃªme had fought in Ã©migrÃ© forces from 1792 until 1801. In 1795 he was serving in the hussards de Choiseul. In 1797, he commanded the RÃ©giment noble Ã cheval in the ArmÃ©e de CondÃ©.7 At the exiled court of his uncle Louis XVIII at Mitau in Courland (now Latvia) in June 1799, he married his first cousin, the daughter of Louis XVI Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Charlotte. Then he returned to the ArmÃ©e de CondÃ© to command the RÃ©giment noble Ã cheval again during 1800â1801.8 After the dissolution of the ArmÃ©e de CondÃ©, he shared the exile of Louis XVIII. From 1807, they lived in England, generously pensioned by the British government, which kept the Bourbons in reserve as a weapon against Napoleon. Almost his entire life had been spent outside France. Showing that the emigration was not a monolith but a diaspora in constant evolution, by 1804 he had become a moderate. He supported the grant of nobility to all officers; recognition of the sale of the biens nationaux; a general amnesty; the abolition of conscription; and a ârien qui dÃ©note la haine ou la vengeanceâ [ânothing which denotes hatred or vengeanceâ].9\n\nThe second key figure was Wellington. Partly educated before 1789 at the Ecole royale militaire dâAngers, he spoke French and knew how to avoid the unpopularity normally attached to foreign invaders. From the moment the British army, victorious from the Peninsular war, entered France on 31 October 1813, it rarely pillaged and always paid for supplies. Wellington wrote: âthe French exert themselves to get us intelligence. In no part of Spain have we been better, I might say so well, received.â10\n\nCount Lynch is the least known of the three. Of Irish and Jacobite origin, he was a rich landowner and former PrÃ©sident at the Parlement de Bordeaux. Imprisoned under the Terror, briefly an Ã©migrÃ© in London, he had been appointed mayor of Bordeaux in 1808. His royalism was reinforced by the frequentation of royalists in Paris, by the degradation of the French economy, and by his detestation of Napoleonâs despotism.11 Filled with the âsacred re of religion and loyaltyâ, Lynch would consider Louis XVIII, as he wrote in 1814, âthe image of the divinity on Earthâ.12\n\nThe entry of the Duc dâAngoulÃªme into Bordeaux on 12 March 1814 teaches distrust of nationalist narratives and official documents. Until the deposition of Napoleon by the Senate on 2 April, Wellington frequently, and sometimes harshly, denied all commitment to the Bourbons.13 In London the official policy of the government was, with its allies, to make peace with Napoleon. Ministers would later claim that the Bourbons had left England against their consent. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Castlereagh was present at the congress of ChÃ¢tillon between the allies and the French Empire from 7 February to 11 March. The Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Bathurst had written to Wellington on 18 January that towards the Bourbons there was âno engagement whatsoever on the part of this countryâ.14\n\nBut these were letters written to be shown to Britainâs allies or to the Whig opposition in parliament; and in order to be able to drop the Bourbons with good conscience if events turned against them. The British government was playing a double game, a metaphor it often used. In a private letter to Castlereagh, the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool wrote of âthe Bourbon gameâ.15 From the Foreign Office, Edward Cook also wrote to Castlereagh, after Bordeaux had declared for the Bourbons: âI have no doubt now that, were the whole game played, it would succeed ... will you send to Monsieur?â16\n\nThe restoration of the Bourbons had been a secret âgameâ of the British government, and the Prince of Wales (later George IV), at least since the arrival of the Comte dâArtois in London in 1799 and his first meetings with William Pitt. Only their restoration, believed Pitt and his colleagues, would restore the political balance in Europe and return France to its frontiers of 1789. On 19 June 1811, the entire French royal family, including Louis XVIII, had been the guests of honour of the Prince Regent at the stupendous party with which he inaugurated his regency. The British government helped finance the distribution of Louis XVIIIâs 1813 declaration of Hartwell. Castlereagh had influenced its content in secret meetings with the kingâs confidential advisor, and Grand MaÃ®tre de la Garde-robe, another Ã©migrÃ© former officer in the ArmÃ©e de CondÃ©, the Comte de Blacas.17 Liverpool and Castlereagh, like their predecessors, often saw Artois in London, and heard him renew his promises to return to the French frontiers of 1789.18\n\nFrom the moment of his entry into France, Wellington utilized local royalists and former Ã©migrÃ©s as sources of information. For example, Monsieur Mailhos, a Bordeaux royalist, came to his headquarters to advise him about the situation inside Bordeaux in December 1813. To encourage the arrival of a Bourbon in France, Wellington sent to London an Ã©migrÃ© officer called the Comte de Gramont. Gramont was the grandson of Marie Antoinetteâs detested favourite the Duchesse de Polignac, and had been brought up in England by the Polignacsâ friends the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. He had served in the Ã©migrÃ© units the RÃ©giment de Roll and the Chasseurs britanniques, before joining the British army, in the Prince of Walesâ favourite regiment the 10th Hussars, in 1805. The Gramonts, moreover, had possessed estates in BÃ©arn, precisely the region invaded by Wellingtonâs army in January 1814. Gramont saw not only Liverpool and Castlereagh in London, but also Louis XVIII in Hartwell House, outside Aylesbury, where Gramontâs father served the exiled king as one of his capitaines des gardes.19 Thus Wellington in 1813â1814, like Castlereagh in London since 1812 or earlier, while claiming not to be interfering in French politics, was in reality pursuing a secret pro-Bourbon policy. He wrote to Lord Bathurst on 21 November 1813 that Bonaparte was detested: âif Great Britain would stand by him [a Bourbon] I am certain he would succeedâ.20 He wrote again on 10 January: âif you cannot make peace with him [Napoleon] in the winter we must run at him in the spring; and it would be advisable to put forward one of the Bourbons in that case.â21\n\nIn 1808, and again in 1810 and 1811, the British government had prevented Artois and AngoulÃªme from joining the war against Napoleon in Spain. In January 1814, however, after some hesitation,22 it gave them passports under assumed names; embarrassing in Spain, they could be useful in France. Furthermore, public opinion and the Prince Regent supported them.23 On 16 January, a friend of the Regent better informed than most of cial dispatches, Lord Yarmouth, wrote: âBunbury [Henry Bunbury, UnderâSecretary of State for War and the Colonies] is gone to Lord Wellington ... to arrange for the appearance of a Bourbon there, and to say much on this subject which Government are too much afraid of Whitbread [a Whig MP in the House of Commons] to put on paper.â24\n\nArtois and his sons AngoulÃªme and Berry left England with British passports, and full powers to act in Louis XVIIIâs name, on 22 January.25 On 2 February, incognito under the name of Comte de Pradel, AngoulÃªme arrived at Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the Atlantic coast, next to the PyrÃ©nÃ©es. The mayor, described as âun homme tout Ã nousâ [a man totally on our side], received him well.26 On 10 February, AngoulÃªme was officially received, as a prince rather than incognito, by Wellington at his headquarters. The Judge Advocate-General Francis Larpent attached to headquarters, was unimpressed by âthe little dukeâ (referring to his shortness), but noticed that he seemed âmuch pleased with his prospectsâ.27\n\nAngoulÃªme was accompanied by Gramont, who was received with joy on the former family estates near Bidache: âwhile some clasped his knees and others implored him to take possession of his heritage, others stood weeping with joyâ, asking for âold times and old landlordsâ.28 AngoulÃªme made contact with royalist agents. Emigration and distance had destroyed neither their networks nor their effectiveness. On 22 February, AngoulÃªme sent Wellington two men from Bordeaux, praising âyour attachment for our causeâ.29 On 6 March, according to AngoulÃªme, Wellington told him: âyes without difficulty, I will assign to you the government of the occupied territory.â The alliance between AngoulÃªme and Wellington was shown both by AngoulÃªmeâs coordination of his movements with Wellington, and by the political authority ceded by Wellington to AngoulÃªme in areas occupied by the British army.30\n\nBordeaux was the third element, with the Ã©migrÃ© government and the British government and army, which made AngoulÃªmeâs entry on 12 March 1814 a triumph. It had the dynamism and independence of an international port ready to defy the national capital, and an Anglophilia based on nostalgia for the cityâs past trading links with England. In contrast, a royalist attempt at Rodez in Auvergne in February and the plots discussed at the chÃ¢teau of Soufron by TimothÃ©e de la Clergerie and the Chevalier de la Roche-Aymon led to nothing.31\n\nIn 1810, when the Napoleonic empire appeared to be at its apogee, a royalist network in Bordeaux created in 1798â1799, the Institut Philanthropique, had entered into contact with two Ã©migrÃ© representatives of Louis XVIII, his envoy in London the Comte de La ChÃ¢tre (commander of the Loyal Emigrant regiment in British service in 1793â1802) and his chief adviser the Comte de Blacas. The intermediaries were three merchants from Bordeaux: MM. Julien PÃ©faut de La Tour, Perrin and Rollac.32 Confirming the Ã©migrÃ© governmentâs support, La ChÃ¢tre paid Perrin Â£300 in travel expenses. Blacas saw the messengers from Bordeaux and remained in correspondence with them.33 Like the arrival of Mailhos at Wellingtonâs headquarters in December 1813, the initiative came from Bordeaux. In London on 12 March 1813, Taffard de Saint-Germain, a former parlementaire of âabsolute devotionâ, had been appointed Louis XVIIIâs representative in Bordeaux.34 A royalist called Ferdinand de Bertier, according to his own account, helped coordinate the agents of Louis XVIII, Bordeaux royalists and former Ã©migrÃ©s like Comtes Maxence de PuysÃ©gur and Alexandre de Lur-Saluces, and his own Catholic royalist network, the Chevaliers de la Foi.35\n\nIn Bordeaux, Taffard and the royalists began to infiltrate the National Guard, as other royalists were doing in Paris at the same time. Like the director of a modern electoral campaign, Taffard prepared his party emblems: white cockades and white flags. In addition he enrolled 800 Bordelais (perhaps workers needing money), in a secret Garde Royale Bordelaise, distinct from the National Guard.36 On 11 November 1813, the prefect of the Gironde wrote to the minister of police, âworkers are being enrolled for the kingâ. There were some arrests, but the chiefs were spared.37\n\nThe best known Bordelais royalist was Monsieur LainÃ©, born in Bordeaux in 1768. As a representative in the corps lÃ©gislatif in Paris, on 13 December 1813 he had launched an unprecedented attack on Napoleon, which angered the Emperor and impressed public opinion. Expressing the growing discontent which would help the Bourbons recover the French throne in 1814, he denounced the âodious scourgeâ of conscription and continued: âcommerce is destroyed, industry is dying and there is not one Frenchman who does not have in his fortune or his family a cruel wound to heal ... It is time that nations breathed again.â38 LainÃ© retired to Bordeaux. For him as for many others in the city, as he wrote in private notes on 20 February, âthe character and interest of the Bourbons guarantees to the French the free exercise of their industry and that fortunate freedom of trade, which before 1790 had brought prosperity to all the working classes of societyâ.39 Therefore, in some of the middle class, the period âbefore 1790â had not left exclusively bad memories. Some remembered the booming international trade of the reign of Louis XVI. The Empire had become unpopular because of economic decline, as well as military defeat; even the Emperor had admitted in his furious reply to LainÃ© that the French had not forgotten âthe Bourbonsâ.\n\nEvents in Bordeaux would show that in 1814 French nationalism could be weaker than royalism and desire for peace with Europe. In February and March, Bordelais, Ã©migrÃ©s and Wellington renewed contacts. On 19 February, another former Ã©migrÃ© and VendÃ©e leader the Marquis de La Rochejacquelin left Bordeaux in disguise with further news for Wellington. On 27 February, Taffard and Lynch met in Bordeaux. After his victory over the French army at Orthez on 27 February, Wellington wrote on 4 March from Saint-Sever to Lord Liverpool in favour of the Bourbons: âany declaration from us would, I am convinced, raise such a flame in the country as would soon spread from one end of it to the other and would infallibly overturn him. I cannot discover the policy of not hitting a man as hard as one can and in the most vulnerable placeâ.40\n\nOn 6 March at Saint-Sever, Georges Bontemps Dubarry, another former Ã©migrÃ© and Bordelais royalist, and a friend of Taffard de Saint-Germain, suggested to Wellington that he should advance on Bordeaux. On 7 March, Bontemps Dubarry wrote to General Beresford, who commanded Portuguese and British forces under Wellington, âthere is a large party at Bordeaux in favour of the Bourbonsâ.41 Beresford often saw royalist agents and on 11 March wrote to Wellington: âthe sentiments and opinions of the people of all classes in proportion as we advance are obviously stronger in favour of their ancient Princes and violent against Buonaparte.â Wellington then ordered Beresford to advance on Bordeaux. He was ready to follow French royalistsâ advice in deciding British army movements.42 Meanwhile between 4 and 10 March, French authorities and troops, most of whom remained loyal to Napoleon, had evacuated Bordeaux.43\n\nOn 12 March in Bordeaux, the cityâs change of allegiance proceeded according to plan, without mistakes and without bloodshed. Towards midday, Beresford appeared at the head of his troops at the Porte Saint Julien of Bordeaux. The mayor was there to meet him. Seeing Beresford advance towards him, Lynch took off his tricolore cockade, put on a white cockade,44 and said: âIt is in a city of His Majesty our King and the ally of yours that we have the honour to receive Your Excellency.â45 Lynch had declared for Louis XVIII under the physical protection of a foreign army, supported by a âsacred bandâ of royalists inside Bordeaux, to whom Taffard had given an âample provision of white cockadesâ. The two sides had obtained what both had long desired: French royalists won foreign protection from reprisals if their demonstrations failed; the British a royalist demonstration without a public official commitment on their part.\n\nLynch later wrote that the cry of âVive le roi!â was repeated far beyond his hopes by the people. Another witness, M. FerrÃ¨re, wrote that they returned from the gate âin the middle of a diabolical noise [bruit dâenfer] from an innumerable populace and cries to the heavens of âVive le roiâ.â46 These royalist accounts are confirmed by British sources. On the same day, Beresford wrote to Wellington in a private letter: âthe whole town came out to meet us ... The mayor was very frequently interrupted in his short discourse with cries of âÃ bas les aigles!â, âvivent les Bourbons!â and he finished by stripping himself of all the colours and insignia of Buonaparte and putting on the white cockade and scarf; and everybody appeared instantly in white cockades and they have declared openly against Buonaparte.â47\n\nBeresford told Lynch in the HÃ´tel de Ville that he neither ordered nor forbade the display of white flags. He said that England was only waging war on Bonaparte, not on France. There were cries of âVive le roi!â and âVivent les Anglais!â48 The proclamation published that evening by âthe mayor of Bordeaux to his fellow citizensâ is a European, French, Bordelais and royalist document. It ignores issues of revolution, emigration and nationalism and emphasizes freedom, the economy and the benefits of international peace. âBordelais! I can assure you that the firm intention of His Majesty is to favour industry and to bring back among us that impartial freedom of trade, which before 1789 had spread prosperity among the working classes ... The sea which had been useless for you will bring friendly flags back to your port.â The mayor cited the example of Amsterdam, which had also revolted against Napoleon in favour of its former dynasty, the House of Orange, on 15 November 1813, said that the ârivalry of nations should ceaseâ, praised Wellington as âthe liberator of peoplesâ [Portugal and Spain as well as France] and denounced Napoleon as âthe scourge of nationsâ. He assured that all liberal institutions would be maintained and the sale of national properties guaranteed. This day will make Bordeaux âforever famous and fortunate among citiesâ.49\n\nAngoulÃªme arrived at 4 pm, accompanied by Gramont and his Premier gentilhomme, Comte Etienne de Damas-Crux, who had commanded an Ã©migrÃ© regiment, the LÃ©gion de Damas in 1792â1801 before entering his household. Acting like a political candidate in an election, AngoulÃªme also, like LainÃ©, appealed to popular hatred of despotism, war and high taxation: âno more tyrant! No more war! No more conscription! No more vexatious taxes!â After a Te Deum in the cathedral, he went to the town hall and finally to the royal palace, where Napoleon had stayed in 1808. According to M. Defermon, the inhabitants âare intoxicated with the joy of seeing himâ. The âsacred bandâ of royalists obliged them âwithout violenceâ to wear the white cockade. âNot one balcony, not one window, which was not filled with womenâ, wrote another Bordelais, the young writer Edmond GÃ©raud.50 The white flag flew above every building.51\n\nThere was little hostility to AngoulÃªme as a Bourbon or an Ã©migrÃ©. The issues of 1814 were more important than the divisions of 1789â1802. Lynch wrote of âthis adorable prince. Everyone wants to see him, to touch his clothes, the harness of his horseâ. In contrast to Napoleon and his âmameloucksâ, AngoulÃªme said âhe could not be better guarded than by the peopleâ. On 13 March, when AngoulÃªme went to the Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre, there was a âdelirium of happinessâ. The orchestra played both French and British tunes: âVive Henri IV!â and âGod Save the King!â\n\nIn 1814 Bordeaux was reconnecting to Europe as well as the Bourbons. Doubtless the Anglo-Irish origin of the mayor (who spoke in English to British officers on 12 March52 and had a brother in London), helped his relations with Wellington and Beresford, who were also Anglo-Irish. In Bordeaux so detested were Napoleonâs wars that foreign soldiers and returning Ã©migrÃ©s were more popular than French soldiers. In cabarets, according to the diary of Edmond GÃ©raud, foreign troops drank and smoked with Bordelais âÃ qui mieux mieuxâ. For GÃ©raud, Napoleon was not a man but a tiger. He preferred the English and Portuguese soldiers in Bordeaux, who were âas calm as nunsâ, to the âbrigands of the grande armÃ©eâ.53 âThe regularity and excellent conduct of the troops astonish the city and even myselfâ, wrote their commander Lord Dalhousie to Wellington.54 Bordeaux later presented him with a sword of honour, which is still in the possession of his descendants today.55\n\nA royal guard was organized in 11 companies of foot and horse. In a white uniform, âemblem of the purity and delity of its sentimentsâ, it guarded the prince and maintained order.56 âBut,â wrote AngoulÃªme to Wellington, âthere is more ardour to be officers than soldiersâ.57 AngoulÃªme and LainÃ©, who became prefect, organized the civil administration. âOur little governmentâ, as Lynch called it, also started its own newspaper, the MÃ©morial Bordelais.58 AngoulÃªme issued a proclamation on 15 March renewing his promises of peace; the end of conscription and âodious taxesâ; guaranteeing the sale of domaines dits nationaux and freedom of religion (there were many Protestants in Bordeaux); and asking for an end to âtout esprit de partiâ.59\n\nEyewitnesses, such as Edmond GÃ©raud, Defermon, FerrÃ¨re, Lynch and Beresford, noticed three factors:\n\nFollowing the joy of 12 March, fear of a peace treaty between Napoleon and the allies, after which the Emperor could have punished the royalists, returned. On 14 March, Beresford wrote to Wellington: âI am far from being sure that the majority of the respect- able merchants and people have declared for the white cockade.â A large part of the former National Guard continued to wear the trico- lour cockade, suggesting that they preferred Napoleon to the Bourbons. Beresford wrote on 19 March: âthe good example of Bordeaux does not spread at all and to judge by their long and sour faces I would imagine they had already repented the step. You can- not conceive the terrors and alarms under which all descriptions of people tremble at present.â60 It was these âterrors and alarmsâ, which had often paralysed action by royalists and Ã©migrÃ©s before 1814.\n\nThe popularity of the duc dâAngoulÃªme. He did not put a foot wrong. Among his âtouching wordsâ were âto be a Bordelais is impressive enoughâ and âsince 12 March everyone is noble in Bordeauxâ.61 When he invited merchants to dine with him at his table, âfrom that moment the entire city was royalistâ.62\n\nRelative absence of class tension. Royalism attracted nobles, bour- geois and workmen. Philippe FerrÃ¨re spoke of the presence in the royalist crowd on 12 March of âthe lowest class of society ... they were workmen and labourers in the costume of their condition, most wearing the livery of their povertyâ.63 AngoulÃªmeâs council included former Ã©migrÃ©s, such as Etienne de Damas, Lynch, the comtes de PuysÃ©gur and Lur-Saluces, and non-nobles who had not emigrated, such as LainÃ© and Ravez.64 Past loyalties were less important than present attitudes. The precise importance of Bordeaux in the restoration of the Bourbons is difficult to judge. On 17 March, Talleyrand wrote from Paris to the Duchesse de Courlande: âIf peace is not made, Bordeaux becomes a factor of great importance in politics. If peace is made, Bordeaux loses its importanceâ.65 The entry of the Duc dâAngoulÃªme on 12 March was the unequivocal event that the allies needed to dare to support the Bourbons publicly. At Dijon on 28 March, Metternich, Castlereagh and other European diplomats drank to the health of the mayor of Bordeaux before that of Louis XVIII.66\n\nBordeaux, however, was not an isolated incident. The unpopularity of the Napoleonic Empire and the popularity of the returning Bourbons and their foreign allies were evident in Paris itself. The allied armies advanced on Paris when they were convinced, by intercepted letters of the strength of royalist feeling in the capital.67 On 31 March, after Napoleonâs army had been defeated and Napoleonic authorities had left the capital, foreign troops and sovereigns were acclaimed on the boulevards by crowds of Parisians. Many Russian officers considered they were watching a great people finally breathing freely.68 Some Parisians shouted: âA bas le Corse! A bas le tyran! Vive notre libÃ©rateur!â69 A British eyewitness, Lord Charles Stewart, confirmed in part by accounts written on the same day by the French foreign minister Caulaincourt to Napoleon, described the allied entry to his brother, Lord Castlereagh: âAll Paris seemed to be assembled and concentrated on one spot.â Alexander I and Frederick William III were âpositively devouredâ amidst cries of âVive lâEmpereur Alexandre! Vive le Roi de Prusse! Vivent les Rois libÃ©rateurs!â Lord Charles Stewart also wrote: âNor did the air alone resound with these peals; for, with louder acclamations, if possible, they were mingled with those of Vive le Roi! Vive Louis XVIII! Vive les Bourbons! A bas le tyran! The white cockade appeared very universally, many of the National Guards whom I saw wore them.â70 Russian accounts also con rm the frequency of cries of Vive Louis XVIII! Vivent les Bourbons! as well as Vive Alexandre Ier!71\n\nAmong the allies were more returning Ã©migrÃ©s, such as Count Pozzo di Borgo, who had not seen France since 1792. He had become an Aide de Camp and councillor of Alexander I, had helped write his proclamations in France and, as Russian ambassador in Paris, would remain a key figure in French politics and European diplomacy from 1814 until 1831.72\n\nFor a time Alexander I and his solders, known to some as âles cupidons du Nordâ, remained popular in certain quarters of Paris. Except in some of the poorer, outlying suburbs, nationalism was not as strong as love of peace.73 The sister of Chateaubriand, Madame de Marigny, praised the Tsar in her journal: âgood, affable, generous ... The Parisians are mad about himâ [en raffolent].74 As in Bordeaux, defeat was seen by some as a blessing, which reconnected France and Europe; her brotherâs best-selling pamphlet of April 1814 was called: De Buonaparte, des Bourbons, et de la nÃ©cessitÃ© de se rallier Ã nos princes lÃ©gitimes pour le bonheur de la France et celui de lâEurope.\n\nThe former leaders of the emigration, the Comte dâArtois and Louis XVIII, were also welcomed back, although by no means unanimously, in 1814. On 12 April 1814, escorted by royalists (including former Ã©migrÃ©s such as Chateaubriand), English diplomats and officers, and Napoleonic Marshals, Artois entered Paris, wearing the uniform of the Paris National Guard. Lady Burghersh, Wellingtonâs niece, claimed that he was cheered with âthe most violent acclamations ... a degree of enthusiasm which I never saw in England for anythingâ, although another English eyewitness called T. R. Underwood was more sceptical.75 In a state of extreme exaltation (ânon jamais on ne pourra peindre cette ivresseâ), Madame de Marigny, who was present, thanked God for having preserved âthe family of Saint Louisâ, and the Allies who had returned them to France.76\n\nOn 3 May Louis XVIII himself, with his niece and their cousins the former Ã©migrÃ© leaders the Prince de CondÃ© and the Duc de Bourbon sitting in the same carriage (an honour which those princes would not have received before 1789), entered Paris in their turn. Although many French soldiers were hostile, the king and his party were acclaimed in the streets of Paris and in Notre-Dame by civilians with delirious cries of âVive le Roiâ. Desire for peace, lower taxes, freedom, prosperity and a constitutional regime (all promised the day before in the kingâs DÃ©claration de Saint-Ouen) were stronger than nationalism, resentment at defeat, or memories of the divisions of 1789â1802.77\n\nLike Bordeaux and Paris, Toulouse also welcomed foreign troops. When AngoulÃªme had entered the city on 27 April 1814 with Wellington, followed by British, Spanish, and Portuguese officers, according to an English witness:\n\nThousands of Country People crowded each side of the road for a League before we reached Toulouse and absolutely deafened us with acclamations so that we could hardly hear the thunder of Artillery or the bells of churches ... windows and even the house tops were crowded full of ladies, waving handkerchiefs, clapping hands and calling with all their might Vive le Roi and Vive les Bourbons.78\n\nThus the events of 12 March in Bordeaux, 27 April in Toulouse and 31 March, 12 April and 3 May in Paris suggest that in 1814 emigration and nationalism were not dominating issues. Returning Ã©migrÃ©s were cheered if they were thought to be bringing tangible political and economic benefits. Bordeaux in particular shows that returning Ã©migrÃ©s, like AngoulÃªme, Gramont and Damas, knew how to respond to the realities of the moment. It was not the return of the Ã©migrÃ©s in 1814 which was unpopular but some Ã©migrÃ©sâ subsequent actions and attitudes, and for some Frenchmen, the return of the King in 1815, after the defeat of Waterloo, âin the baggage-train of the foreignersâ (Figs. 13.1 and 13.2).\n\nFigs. 13.1 (r and v): The Brassard de Bordeaux. (All images are from the authorâs private collection) The Order of the Brassard de Bordeaux was founded by Louis XVIII on 6 September 1814, at the request of his agent in Bordeaux Taffard de Saint- Germain, to reward the royalists who had served in Bordeaux in March 1814. As a royalist rallying sign, they had worn a white âbrassardâ or arm-band, which was prob- ably a reminiscence of similar arm-bands worn by Ã©migrÃ©s serving in the ArmÃ©e de CondÃ© in the 1790s. This illustration shows the insignia of the Order: a white arm- band decorated with a gold sun-burst enclosing two entwined Lâs, for Louis XVIII, and the legend âBordeaux 12 March 1814â. It comes from a âPrÃ©cis historique du 12 Mars 1814â composed by âJacques Dejernon, ex-Maitre de Pension a Bordeaux, natif de Pau, volontaire royal du 12 mars 1814â and printed by the Imprimerie de Moreau in Bordeaux. AngoulÃªme and his court officials Guiche, Etienne de Damas-Crux and Comte Francois dâEscars, always wore the Brassard de Bordeaux in 1814â1815\n\nFig. 13.2 Jacques Dejernon, Portrait of Louis XVIII between the Duc and Duchesse dAngoulÃªmeâ.

AngoulÃªme revisited Bordeaux in March 1815 with his wife. They helped make it a bastion of popular royalism and opposition to Napoleon, but thereafter resided in and around Paris\n\nNotes\n\n1 Moniteur Universel, 4 October 1820, 1385\n\n2 Ibid., 15 October 1820, 1389\n\n3 AbbÃ© Moulard, Le comte Camille de Tournon, 3 vols, (Paris: Publisher, 1927â1932), 3: 216.\n\n4 Laurent Coste, Histoire des maires de Bordeaux (Bordeaux: Dossiers dâAquitaine, 2008), 223; 238; Arthur Young, âDiary for 26 August 1787,â in Travels in France, second edition (London: Bohn, 1889), 67; 69.\n\n5 Camille Jullian, Histoire de Bordeaux, 2 vols.

Reboul (eds.), French Emigrants in Revolutionised Europe, War, Culture and Society, 1750â1850, web:\n\nCities have their own dynamism. Location, population, and wealth give them the power to defy or ignore a state. They are economic, social and cultural organisms whose inhabitants exploit, but also need each other, or they would not be living there. At times â particularly before the triumph of nationalism in 1914 - the city could ignore government decrees, the call of the minaret and the pulpit, or popular violence. Cities can outlast states and creeds, and have more impact. Alexandria outlasted the Ptolemies, Paris the monarchy which had made it capital of France.\n\nIf you approach history and identity through cities rather than states, nationalism is less dominant than it appears. Much of what is known as French culture is really Parisian culture, to which foreign Parisians, from German craftsmen and printers to Italian composers, made huge contributions. Most Czechs living in Vienna before 1918 became Viennese â as a glance at names in the phone book will show. Jobs were more important than nationalism.\n\nCities subvert clichÃ©s about nations and national character. Cities in the same country can differ more from each other than they do from foreign cities. Think how different Marseille is from Lille or Izmir from Konya. Think of the similarities between Marseille and Naples, or Izmir and Thessaloniki. This article discusses some of the least national cities of all; the cities of the Levant, particularly Smyrna, Alexandria and Beirut.\n\nThe cities of the Levant have the same appeal, in the Middle East, as pre-1933 Berlin and pre-1938 Vienna in Europe, or pre-1959 Havana in the Caribbean. They symbolise the lost paradise, friendly to minorities, devoted to pleasure, which flourished before these cities were gutted by nationalism. For many of their former inhabitants scattered throughout the world, Smyrna, Alexandria and Beirut had a similar effect to Berlin on Christopher Isherwood, in the years after he left in 1933: âalways in the background was Berlin. It was calling me every night and its voice was the harsh, sexy voice of the gramophone recordsâ¦ Berlin had affected me like a party at the end of which I didnât want to go homeâ.1\n\nEight characteristics distinguished these cities; geography; diplomacy; polyglottism; hybridity; trade; pleasure; modernity; and vulnerability. Levantine cities were not national but world cities. They were precursors of â and warnings to - todayâs global cities.\n\n1 Geography\n\nThe Levant means âwhere the sun risesâ: the eastern Mediterranean. Levant is a geographical word, free from associations with race or religion. It is defined not by frontiers but by the sea. The great Levantine cities, Smyrna, Alexandria, Beirut - and many smaller ports like Salonica, Mersin, Jaffa - were âwindows on the worldâ, ports more mixed and open than inland capitals like Ankara, Damascus and Cairo. Through sea travel and trade, Levantine cities were closer, both physically and mentally, to each other and to other Mediterranean ports, than to cities in their own hinterland. It was quicker and safer to travel by boat between ports than by road to the hinterland. In 1938 the great Egyptian writer Taha Hussein claimed that the future of Egyptian culture was Mediterranean: âthere is no difference in mentality or culture between the peoples who live around the sea of the Roum and have been influenced by it.â2 Another characteristic of Levantine cities became their sense of distance from the hinterland â and the latterâs sense of exclusion.\n\n2 Diplomacy\n\nA western name for an eastern area, the Levant was also a dialogue â at the heart of what Gibbon called âthe worldâs debateâ between Christianity and Islam. In the Levant, as cities defied states and coasts turned their back on hinterlands, so deals came before ideals. Dialogue trumped conflict. The modern Levant was a product of one of the most successful alliances in history, for three and a half centuries after 1535, between France and the Ottoman empire, between the Caliph of the Muslims and the Most Christian King. Based on international strategy, on the shared hostility of the two monarchies to Spain and the House of Austria, the âunion of the lily and the crescentâ (as the French ambassador Savary de Breves called it in 1604) soon acquired commercial and cultural momentum.\n\nagreements between the Ottoman and foreign governments which allowed foreigners to live and trade, in the Ottoman Empire, for the most part under their own legal systems. (This is still a toxic issue today: Khomeini denounced the Shah in 1961 because American troops had been made exempt from Iranian law; American soldiers left Iraq in 2011 because the US government refuses to allow Americans to be subject to Iraqi law). As a result of the French-Ottoman alliance, French consuls were appointed to most Levantine cities. The Levant became a very near East, where, thanks to Ottoman order and alliances, trade and travel were relatively safe.\n\nThese were the âyears of the consulsâ. Magnificently costumed Janissaries guarded them from insult or attack. In Izmir in the 1670âs the great Ottoman writer Evliya Celebi was impressed by European consuls: âIf someone hits an infidel, everyone immediately surrounds him and takes him and brings him to the consular judge or the infidels execute him. And at that time the Muslim people become invisible.so that at this time it seems a dark Frank place.â To show equality of status, consuls refused to remove their hats in the presence of the local governor. At times the ports of the Levant became diarchies between foreign consuls and local officials. During wars between the Ottoman Empire and Venice in 1694, and Russia in 1770, consuls in Smyrna persuaded the commanders of the Venetian and Russian navies respectively, not to attack the city, in order to prevent reprisals by Muslims against local Christians. While the Ottoman Empire was at war, Smyrna remained peaceful.\n\nConsuls acted both as servants of their own government and as local power-brokers and transmitters of technology and information. In the danse macabre of seduction and exploitation which has lasted to this day, outside interference was at least matched by local desire for more of it. In Beirut the el-Khazen family â still prominent in Lebanese politics today - used their position as French consuls or vice-consuls in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to strengthen their own power âbase â and to urge the King of France to âliberateâ â in other words invade - the area.\n\nIn the nineteenth century the British consul in Beirut was visited by members of the Jumblatt dynasty (still hereditary leaders of the Druze community today), asking Britain to rule Lebanon âlike Indiaâ. The Iranian consul in Beirut was a protector of the Lebanese Shia long before the Iranian revolution of 1978 and the rise of Hezbollah. Consulsâ despatches and books are also excellent sources, being less grandiose than ambassadorsâ, for example the books on Ottoman history and society by Paul Rycaut, Britihs consul in Smyrna in the 1660âs and 1670âs, on his life and travels by the seventeenth-century French consul the Chevalier dâArvieux, and on nineteenth-century Lebanon by the British consul Charles Churchill.\n\nConsuls developed into equivalents of modern international organisations like the IMF or NATO: interfering but useful. They brought efficient post offices and law courts â and sometimes troops and warships - to the Levant. In nineteenth century Alexandria consuls protected criminals of their own nationality from Egyptian courts, but also helped introduce quarantine and fight cholera. The British consul general in Alexandria played a vital part in the riots which triggered the British invasion of 1882. Thereafter until 1914 the principal British official in Egypt â the master of the country - was the consul general. Foreign consuls also dominated Beirut after the establishment of a semi-autonomous internationally guaranteed regime in Mount Lebanon in 1861.\n\nToday, as protection from their own governments, businessmen in the Levant still aspire to become consuls for foreign governments.\n\n3 Polyglottism\n\nInternational languages for inter-communal communication, and the habit of speaking more than one language, were another characteristic of the Levant. Before the triumph of English, the Levant used two international languages. First was lingua franca, the simplified Italian âgeneralement entendue par toutes les cotes du Levantâ, âqui a cours part tout le Levant entre les gens de Marine de la Mediterranee et les Marchands qui vont negocier au Levant et qui se fait entendre de toutes les nationsâ, as French travellers wrote. A business rather than a literary language, it was rarely written down. It was spoken by slaves and sailors; by the fishermen of Alexandria; by the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli; and by Cervantes, Rousseau and Byron, who learnt what he called âLevant Italianâ in Athens in 1810. The Gentlemanâs Magazine wrote in 1837 of an Englishman in the Levant: âhe has talked lingua franca till he has half-forgotten Englishâ. Characteristic phrases are: âven acquiâ; âchristiani star fourbiâ: âcome hereâ; âChristians are cunningâ. Lingua franca was proof that the Levant was not a cultural ghetto. More Turks and Arabs learnt lingua franca, in order to talk to foreigners, than Europeans learnt Turkish or Arabic.\n\nFrom 1840, thanks to the spread of schools and of steam and rail travel, French, then the world language from Buenos Aires to Saint Petersburg, became the second â or for many the first - language of the Levant. The language of science, as well as culture and diplomacy, it was spoken by pashas, viziers and sultans; by all rulers of Egypt from Said Pasha to King Farouk; by Mustafa Kemal the moderniser of Turkey, and by the poet from Smyrna, George Seferis; it was an official language of the Ottoman Foreign Office and the municipalities of Alexandria and Beirut. Young Turk revolutionaries learnt French in Paris, which they called a âstar brighter than my dreamsâ. 5000 French words â alluring words like complot, metres, dansos, tirbison - entered the Turkish language. Another form of integration with the outside world.\n\nAs a result many Levantines were â and, as I have heard for myself in Izmir and Beirut, still are â polyglot, speaking several languages, often in the same sentence: combinations of French, Arabic, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Greek or English. The Smouha family, who came from Baghdad via Manchester to Alexandria around 1900 (and now live near Geneva), called the âpolyglot brothâ of French, Arabic and English which they spoke at home in Egypt âfrarabishâ.\n\n4 Hybridity\n\nHybridity and multiple identities were another characteristic of the Levant. The Lebanese American historian William Haddad has written, âthe nation state is the prison of the mindâ. The Levant was a jail break. The Ottoman Empire enforced few of the restrictions and regulations of European governmentsâ such as âpurity of bloodâ in Spain, or religious uniformity in France after the expulsion of the Huguenots in 1685. There were no ghettos. For three centuries Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Jews and Europeans lived and worked side by side in Smyrna and other Levantine cities. Travellers were attracted by the variety of races and costumes in these cities and the juxtaposition of mosques, churches and synagogues, which was both contrary to Muslim law and, then, inconceivable in European cities.\n\nIn Levantine cities, more than any others, no one group dominated demographically. In Smyrna and Beirut after 1700 populations were roughly half Christian and half Muslim. In Alexandria about a quarter Christian and Jewish, of many nationalities, and three quarters Muslim. In contrast to the conformity imposed by governments in Paris or even London, Smyrna, for example, enjoyed, according to the French travelling botanist Piton de Tournefort, âan entire freedom of religionâ. As some still do, Muslims entered churches, even lighting candles â to hear the music or to gain divine protection, in addition to that implored in mosques. By 1700 it had fifty mosques, eight synagogues and seven churches (Catholic, Orthodox and Armenian). In many streets you felt you were in a Christian country. Turks called it âgavur izmirâ or infidel Izmir, as so many non-Muslims lived there. Its names mixed Asia and Europe. Izmir is the Turkish version of the Greek phrase âeis teen Smyrnaâ or into Smyrna.\n\nTwo hundred years later, when the city had a Christian majority, Edith Wharton wrote of Smyrna: âNothing in fact can be more curious than the mixture of Orientalism and European civilization which meets one at every turn in Smyrna. I could not get used to seeing the tramways blocked by trains of loaded camels, the voitures de place filled with veiled Turkish women and the savage-looking Turks and Albanians with weapons in their belts, side by side with fashionably dressed Levantines and Europeansâ.\n\nHouses were built in similar Ottoman-Levantine styles, often by teams of builders fanning out across the area from the mountains of Albania and Macedonia; later by Italian or Paris-trained architects. Palaces and houses like Ras el tine palace in Alexandria, or the Palais Sursock and the Maison Pharaoun in Beirut, blend styles and objects from different countries and centuries: European pictures, neo-Islamic wall decoration, Ottoman inscriptions. Throughout the region after 1850, the same red tiles from Marseille covered roofs.\n\nWhile womenâs lives remained based round the community, outside the home some men developed multiple identities: they were not âtwo solitudesâ, with minimal contact, like French and English-speaking Canadians in pre-1970 Montreal3 . In the seventeenth century Sabbatai Sevi, the âfalse Messiahâ of Smyrna, founded his own religion, with Christian and Muslim as well as Jewish elements. Donme, as his followers were called, are still an important element in Izmir and Istanbul. The Baltazzi family of bankers in Smyrna, like the city itself, were Greek, Ottoman and European. Polyglot Ottoman Governors of Smyrna, like Kiamil Pasha in 1891-1907, and Rahmi Bey in 1913-18, put the interests of the city before the orders of the government and preserved the city from the massacres of Armenians occurring elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire. Men of all religions could enjoy the same cafes and clubs â and in Salonica join the same trades union.\n\nLiving in Constantinople as well as Alexandria, often educated in Europe, the Mohammed Ali dynasty of Egypt, originating from Kavalla on the Aegean, were Ottoman, Egyptian and in some customs and attitudes European. Foreigners were more likely to be present in Mohammed Aliâs palace than pious Muslims. A French consul wrote that Mohammed Ali had bought most of the ulama; those opposed to his projects were exiled. Once one of the most fanatical provinces of the Ottoman Empire, under Mohammed Ali Egypt became one of its most tolerant. Jabarti complained that Christians, âthe enemies of our religionâ, had become âthe companions and intimate friends of His Highnessâ, and even employed Muslims as servants.4 Thanks to him Alexandria developed the first modern square in the Middle East, between the Ottoman city on the peninsula and the ruins of the classical city inland. In 1813 it was described as a âlarge square near the sea â¦ the Europeans come here to breathe the sea breezesâ. By 1829 residence of the French, American and Swedish consuls, it was called the Place des Consuls, visible expression of their power and status. It was redesigned as a formal rectangle in the early 1830s by a political exile from the Papal States called Francesco Mancini with a surrounding area of straight wide streets. At Mohammed Aliâs express wish a Catholic cathedral and an Anglican church were built nearby. Large stone complexes known as okallas, contained court-yards, shops selling âall the productions of Europe, and, on the upper floors, apartments - in effect nineteenth century shopping malls. Round the Place des consuls, according to Mrs George Griffith in 1843, âCarriages of every description filled with smartly dressed ladies are to be seen driving about at all hoursâ.5\n\nHis great grandson King fouad who reigned from 1917 to 1936, having shuttled in his youth between Turin (where he was educated), Vienna (where he had served as Ottoman Military Attache), Paris and Constantinople, as well as Cairo and Alexandria, was a natural cosmopolitan. In the words of Sir Laurence Grafftey Smith, whose memoirs are a superb record of Alexandria, the King had âA taste for cosmopolitan company with a pro-Italian bias in matters of opera, investment and mistresses.â6 In the spirit of the Levant, he came to the throne in debt, but died a multi-millionaire.\n\nKing Fouad, as he became after the proclamation of the constitution in 1922, was both cosmopolitan and patriotic. He helped found Cairo University â importing Italian and French professors - and commissioned magnificent editions of foreign documents on nineteenth century Egypt, for which historians will always be grateful. He also founded the Arab Language Academy, modelled on the Academie francaise, to guard the purity of Arabic, and the Arab Music Academy, which established a system of notation.\n\nIn his reign Egyptian Jews enjoyed what Edward Timms has called âempowered marginality.â They felt Egyptian and, if they thought of Zionism, regarded it as âvery unchicâ. A few years later a Zionist official reported of the 25,000 Jews living in Alexandria: âa decided animosity and antipathy to Zionist aims has sprung up. They look upon it as something that threatens their own peace and must be discouraged.â7\n\nOne of the richest merchants in Beirut, Alfred Sursock, often known as Farid, who died in 1924 was also an Ottoman diplomat, equally at home in Paris, Constantinople and Beirut, equally ready to serve France or the Ottoman Empire: he married an Italian. The late Rafik Hariri was a Saudi businessman with Saudi citizenship, and a friend and fund-raiser for President Chirac (who now lives in a Hariri flat in Paris), as well as Prime Minister of Lebanon. He had three identities, Lebanese, Saudi, French.\n\n5 Trade\n\nLevantine cities were not romantic. They were trading cities, linking the economies of Europe and Asia. Like Hong Kong or Dubai today, they were synonymous with business. Smyrna exported figs, raisins, opium and carpets; Alexandria cotton; Beirut emigrants to the Americas and Africa. People, not monuments, were their main attraction. Thackeray wrote that he liked Smyrna, because, having no monuments to visit, it produced no âfatigue of sublimityâ. In all these cities the corniche, where the boats docked, was the principal meeting-place. The supreme expression of Smyrnaâs role as a world city, trading from Boston to Jakarta, was, and is, the large stone quay facing the sea, known as the Kordon, three and a half kilometres long and twenty eight metres wide. Replacing the old wooden quay and jetties known as the marina, and a stone fort built by Mehmed the Conqueror, the Kordon, with jetties and break waters were built fifty metres out into the sea in 1867-76 by Dussaud freres. Its construction, financed by local Levantine and Greek businessmen, was the largest single urban project in the Ottoman Empire. Dussaud freres also worked on similar quays in other Mediterranean ports - Trieste, Marseille, Toulon, Algiers and Port Said.8\n\nSmyrna owed its rebirth to trade. At the end of a long gulf on the west coast of Anatolia, where the Mediterranean projects furthest into the western-most point of Asia, the gulf of Izmir provides some of the finest anchorage on the coast, capable of receiving the largest ships. The timing of its rebirth was due to merchantsâ desire to evade the Ottoman governmentâs web of customs dues and price restrictions. As early as 1574 Istanbul was suffering shortages because Ottoman ships, sailing from Egypt with provisions for the capital, unloaded them at Izmir â where they could avoid the imperial governmentâs artificially depressed prices.\n\nThe rise of Smyrna â like that of another world port, New York, at the same time - was also stimulated by the arrival of English and Dutch merchants. Principal hub of a vast network of inland trade routes, Smyrna became the city where Asia came shopping for Europe, and Europe for Asia. Jean Baptiste Tavernier wrote in 1634: âSmyrna is today for trade by both sea and land the most famous city of all the Levant and the most famous market for every merchandise going from Europe to Asia and from Asia to Europeâ. From 5,000 in 1600, the population rose â more quickly than New Yorkâs - to around 100,000 in 1700. it was known as âthe eye of Asiaâ or âthe Paris of the Levantâ. Trade, not history or culture, was the cause of the rise of the Greeks, by 1900, to numerical and commercial dominance in Smyrna.\n\nFrenchmen called the Levant âour Indiesâ. Provence lived off the Levant trade. âThe ports of the Levant, you know that they are what is richest and most populous! Smyrna, what wealth!â said Tsar Alexander I to General Comte de Caulaincourt, Ambassador of Napoleon I, in 1808, when planning to divide the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Kordon was fed by the Smyrna to Aydin railway, the first in the Ottoman Empire â which Lord Statford de Redcliffe, at its inauguration in 1856, hoped would one day stretch to Calcutta. Connecting Smyrna to the world, the Kordon was called the Orient of Europe and the Europe of the Orient. Smyrna reflected a world process, the need for a large cosmopolitan port, attractive to foreigners, where a hinterland could trade with the outside world: similar ports with similar functions arose â or in some cases were deliberately created - in Saint Petersburg in 1703; Odessa in 1794; in Bombay in India, in Alexandria after Mohammed Ali came to power in 1805; more recently in Hong Kong (acquired by Britain in 1843); Shanghai (where a municipal council was created by foreigners in 1854); and Dubai â which rose a s a port trading with India and Iran.\n\nUnder Mohammed Ali and his successors Alexandria became a capitalist El Dorado, attracting a gold rush of Europeans and Syrians. In the cotton boom of the 1860âs capital could double every two years. The population rose from 5,000 in 1800 to 100,000 in 1850 and over 200,000 in 1882. It became the main port linking Egypt and Europe, with the largest stock exchange outside Europe and North America. By 1900 Alexandria was the third port of the Mediterranean in volume of traffic, after Genoa and Marseille. Continuing its astonishing growth rate, the population rose from 232,636 in 1882 to 444,617 in 1917. Foreigners formed between 20 and 25% of the population â and many Egyptians, from the royal family down, had foreign blood.9\n\nMoney ruled; the greatest poet of the Levant, the Greek Alexandrian Constantine Cavafy saw nations in economic terms. He told an English friend never to forget that Greece was a country which had lost its capital.\n\nBeirut in 1826 had been described as a republic of merchants, living according to its own laws, independent of the government in Damascus. Its rise was due not only to the dynamism of local merchants but also, like that of Smyrna and Alexandria, to the arrival (from Saida after 1799) of foreign merchants and consuls (the oldest firm in Beirut, the British shipping agent Henry Heald and Co, still going strong today, was established there in 1837). They were attracted by the climate, the proximity to Mount Lebanon, and by the balance between Muslims and Christians in the population. By 1841 according to the American traveller A.A. Paton, Beirut was âa Levantine Scala, a bastard a mongrelâ. Its population also rose astronomically, from 6,000 in 1800 to 130,000 in 1900.\n\n6 Pleasure\n\nAs well as trade, the cities of the Levant were also, for some, synonymous with pleasure. The Christian women of Izmir, according to one visitor, provided âthe most admirable collection of charming feminine faces I have ever seenâ. Evliya Celebi wrote of the gavur âbelovedsâ [dilbers] that âwhen young Muslim men see their sweet-smelling and dishevelled locks their minds become ruined and confusedâ. Later visitors were equally enthusiastic: Combining the grace of Italians, the vivacity of Greeks, and the âstately tournureâ of Ottomans, they possessed âalmost irresistible fascinationâ. Sitting out in the evening in the Rue des Rose, they displayed lips like coral, eyes like fire and âlooks which pierce your brainâ.\n\nCarnival was celebrated at Smyrna with such frenzies of drinking and dancing that Turks thought the revellers mad. European consuls tried to stop Turks frequenting the taverns of the Frank quarter, where they could enjoy âthe most absolute freedomâ¦to commit every kind of outrageâ. Smyrna was not a paradise reserved for foreigners and Greeks. Despite appearances to the contrary, it was not a colonial city. In his memoirs the Turkish writer Naci GÃ¼ndem wrote that it was the Kordon that made Smyrna Smyrna. From sunset until midnight it was like âa fairy-tale countryâ, with âa magic atmosphere which made the most sombre and depressed souls end by laughingâ. If Smyrna is the eye of Asiaâ, it was said, âthe quay is the pupil of the eyeâ. Norman Douglas called Smyrna in 1885 âthe most enjoyable place on earthâ.\n\nPorts bring music as well as freedom. As Havana created rumba, New Orleans jazz, and Buenos Aires tango, -so Smyrna created its own sound, called Smyrnaika or rebetiko. It was the music of rebels, particularly appreciated by the qabadays (Turkish) or dais (Greek), the toughs who, as in other Mediterranean ports, worked, gambled and fought with each other. Rebetiko songs mixed western polyphony and eastern monophony and described the sufferings of the poor and prisoners, the torments of love, or the pleasures of hashish.\n\nWonât you tell, wonât you tell me\n\nWhere hashish is sold?\n\nThe dervishes sell it\n\nIn the upper districts.\n\nWomen were coquettes or tyrants:\n\nâYour black eyes that gaze at me.\n\nMy dear, lower them, because they are killing me.â\n\nâ¦\n\nYou stay up all night at the cafes chantant, drinking beer, Oh!\n\nAnd the rest of us you are treating as green caviare.\n\nPart of the Cordon in Smyrna was lined by cafes with orchestras. A Papazoglu, a musician in one of the cafes, remembered; âwe had to know a song or two from each nationality to please the customers: We played Jewish and Armenian and Arab music. We were citizens of the world, you see.â\n\nThe golden age of Alexandria was the twenty years period between 1936 and 1956. Tensions shown by the independence riots in 1919-21 decreased after a new treaty of friendship with Britain in 1936, gave Egypt greater independence, and a time table for evacuation of British forces from Cairo and Alexandria to the canal-zone and the removal of British advisers from Egyptian ministries. In 1937, after 400 years, the hated capitulations, - denounced as âa form of slavery and reaction from whose evils the Egyptians form the Pasha to the fellah sufferâ - were finally abolished. The consular courts also closed in 1948. Egyptian law henceforth reigned supreme in Egypt.10\n\nThe great novelist Neguib Mahfouz, like many Cairenes spent the summer in Alexandria. He noted the change. Before 1936, he remembered, Egyptians had regarded Alexandria âas a European city where Italian, French, Greek or English were heard far more often than Arabic. The city was beautiful and so clean that one could have eaten off the streetâsâ¦ But all that was for the foreigners. We could only observe from the outsideâ¦ until the Treaty of 1936 which subjected foreigners to the same law as Egyptians. â¦When the Capitulations were abolished, foreigners in Alexandria were forced to change their attitude. They no longer owned the country; we Egyptians were no longer second class citizens. They realised they and we would be appearing before the same magistrates so we began to feel more at ease. The characteristics of European life were still very present; but once the capitulations were abolished they became accessible to us as well. âEgyptians no longer felt outsiders. He went to Greek restaurants like Athineos, famous for its classical orchestra and thes dansant: âin short Alexandria was a European city but belonged to us - Egyptians.â11 He remembered Alexandria as a city where âpopular joy shone everywhereâ.12\n\nThe women of Alexandria, âmodern to the tips of their delicate little feetâ with âa furious desire to break with every prejudice, to taste every sensationâ were, according to Fernand Leprette, one of its main attractions. They are the principal subject of Durrellâs The Alexandria Quartet. Cavafy, the poet of Alexandria, preferred men. He wrote that in a room above a âsuspect tavernaâ, âon that humble bed I had loveâs body, had those intoxicating lipsâ.\n\nAs early as the seventeenth century, according to the French consul the Chevalier dâArvieux, Beirut was distinguished from rival ports like Sidon and Tripoli by love of drinking and singing: âall the citizens of Beirut, whatever their religion, live well together. They are polite, visit each other and arrange parties of pleasure. Even the people is not as wicked as in Sidonâ.13 Everyone who knew it before 1975 has the same phrase: âthe best years of my lifeâ; âit was paradiseâ. It was and is the capital of modern Arab music with singers like and Fairouz and Nancy Ajram. Some popular songs celebrate Beirut itself, âthe lady of the worldâ, âour only starâ, betrayed by the violence of its inhabitants.\n\n7 Modernity\n\nLevantine cities were so modern and so cosmopolitan that, to visitors from the hinterland, Smyrna sometimes seemed like a foreign country. Alexandria resembled a European city moored off the coast of Egypt. Beirut was âthe Paris of the Middle Eastâ.\n\nSchools and universities, as well as businesses, made them modern. Modern Turkey was born not in Anatolia or Istanbul, but in the Levantine port of Salonica, birthplace of Mustafa Kemal and the least Muslim large city in the Ottoman Empire. The Young Turk revolution broke out there in 1908, helped by the protection of foreign consuls and of nearby foreign states. Some of the best schools and newspapers in Istanbul today are continuations of schools and newspapers founded in Salonica, which moved to Istanbul after the former became Greek in 1912.\n\nâSmyrna illuminates like a beacon all the other provinces of the Ottoman Empireâ, wrote the Austrian consul-general Charles de Scherzer. Latife Hanim, wife of Mustafa Kemal, the first Turkish woman to be unveiled in public, was educated at a French school in Smyrna. She came from the Ushakligil family of merchants, another of whom, the writer Halid Ziya, appreciated Smyrna precisely because it contained foreigners and foreign schools.\n\nSmyrna had the Ottoman Empireâs first botanical collections (of the English consul William Sherard at Sevdiyekoy), newspaper, American school, railway, electricity, cinema and football club: Bournabat Football and Rugby Cub, established by English merchants in 1894, fourteen years before the foundation of the legendary Galatasaray team in 1908. Alexandria had the countryâs first theatres (Arabic and Italian), feminist newspaper, bourse and brewery and in Cavafy the first publicly published homosexual poet, outside France, since the ancient world.\n\nSmyrna, Beirut and Alexandriaâs foreign schools, run by the Mission Israelite Universelle, Jesuits, the Order of Notre Dame de Sion, the Freres des Ecoles Chretiennes, and many others, gave pupils the intellectual weapons, including language skills, with which to fight the cultural imperialism they represented. They were attended by Muslims and Jews as well as Christians.\n\nLike other Levantine schools Victoria College in Alexandria, founded in 1906, was not simply a vehicle of cultural imperialism. Early pupils included both supporters and opponents of the British presence in Egypt and the Middle East: Rallis, Rolos and Barkers; but also the sons of Mahmoud Sami alâBarudi, prime minister of Arabi Pasha in 1882; George Antonius, Syrian author of The Arab Awakening (1938) the first account in English of Arab nationalism from an Arab point of view, and an eloquent defence of Palestiniansâ right to their own country; and Mohammed Farghaly, from a great Alexandrian trading family. Known as âthe cotton kingâ, he would be the youngest person and first Egyptian to preside over the cityâs key economic institution, the Cotton exchange.\n\nThe importance of the Syrian Protestant College, later the American University of Beirut in fostering Arab nationalism and the literary renaissance since 1866 is well known. Beirut also had French speaking schools run by Franciscans and Lazarists and the famous Jesuit university of Saint Joseph.\n\nIn Beirut before 1975 wrote Edward Said âEverything seemed possible, every idea, every identity. âFor Mai Ghoussoub, âBeirut exuded optimism and the most disadvantaged believed in its promises. âAfter 1952, as Egyptian businesses were nationalised, Beirut became the financial capital of the Middle East. President Chamoun told Theo Larsson âeverything is permitted in Beirut, except poverty and that is never forgivenâ. It was so tolerant that, despite two Arab-Israeli wars, before 1967 the number of Jews increased.\n\nIn part because other Arab cities were run by police states, Beirut became for Arabs a synonym of freedom. It was the first city in the region where a Muslim woman unveiled â Anbara Salam in 1927. âBeirut is total and absolute freedomâ, writes Zeena al Khalil. As it has been since Nasser stifled Cairo, it remains the Arab worldâs academic and publishing centre, with more and freer publishers, magazines and newspapers than any other city. It is also again becoming a tourist and financial centre. One Hezbollah leader calls it âa lung through which Iran breathes.â\n\nAfter Rafik Haririâs murder in 2005, Beirut witnessed a foretaste of the Arab spring of 2011, the first mass pro-democracy demonstrations against an Arab dictatorship â in this case the Syrian government, which dominated the country.\n\n8 Vulnerability\n\nSmyrna, Alexandria and Beirut were also cities on the edge; race and religious hate, looting and burning, were ready to erupt. Like London during the riots of August 2011, they show how quickly cities can become jungles. Some see them as urban Titanics, doomed to disaster.\n\nOn 11 July 1882 for example British warships opened fire on Alexandria. That day and the next the main sounds in Alexandria were the crackle and roar of flames, the crash of falling buildings, and howling dogs.14 Alexandria turned, in the words of a British consular assistant A. Hulme Beaman, into âa dantesque Inferno, alight almost from end to end, the flames running riot from street to street without any attempt being made to check them being made, with wild figures here and there pillaging and looting and ghastly corpses swollen to gigantic proportions lying charred and naked in the roadways.â15 The only object untouched was the statue of Mohammed Ali, who seemed to survey the ruins with disgust.\n\nOne problem was that none of these mixed cities had a strong, autonomous administration, or armed forces of their own to protect them. By 1800 New York had overtaken Smyrna as an international port in part because, from the 1650âs, it had its own city council, and Smyrna did not. Municipalities were founded in Smyrna and Beirut in 1868 and in Alexandria in 1892, before other cities in the region. Nevertheless they were weak and divided. From the start the Alexandria municipality was multi-national, with limits on the number of members from each nationality, and there were complaints that some members did not know Arabic. Internal municipal documents were always in French, public ones in French and Arabic.16\n\nBeirut city council was always divided along confessional lines, with equal numbers of Muslims and Christians, since its foundation in 1832 by Mahmud Nami an Egyptian Circassian educated in France.\n\nHybridity, which had suited most Ottoman governors, and the Mohammed Ali dynasty in Egypt, dismayed the nationalists of the twentieth century. As a sign of the times, in 1909 Tel Aviv was founded in opposition to the neighbouring Levantine port of Jaffa, as a mono-faith Jewish city without âgoysâ: The first Israeli Prime Minister Ben Gurion later denounced âthe spirit of the Levant which ruins individuals and societiesâ.\n\nIn addition to inspiring resentment of their mixed character, Levantine cities reflected economic tensions between ports and hinterlands. In the mountains surrounding Smyrna, Salonica and Beirut bandits were eager to kidnaps rich merchantsâ children for the sake of a substantial ransom. In Smyrna the mainly Turkish and Jewish poor were kept in outlying districts. The city was divided into two municipalities, so that richer districts did not have to subsidise poorer ones. The governor in person in the 1890âs would stop men from the hinterland, arriving in traditional dress and baggy trousers, from entering the smart districts of the city centre.\n\nDaily co-existence in work and pleasure did not prevent periodic eruptions of nationalism. Smyrna was said to enjoy ten years of massacre, followed by thirty years of merriment. There were riots between Greeks and Turks in 1770, 1797 and 1821 â a long peace marked by the visits of two Ottoman Sultans, in 1850 and 1863 â then cataclysm after its conquest by the Turkish army in September 1922.\n\nSmyrna had survived the First World War without massacres or deportations thanks to the governor Rahmi Bey, and its own trading spirit. British merchants made uniforms for the Turkish army, on the grounds that it was better to keep markets for your country than to fight for it.\n\nThe Greek occupation of 1919-22 changed everything. Consuls had organised a relatively peaceful transfer of power from Turkey to Greece in Crete after 1898 and Salonica in 1912, but could not do so, from Greece to Turkey, in Smyrna in 1922.\n\nSoon after the Turkish army re-entered the city in 9 September 1922 a fire was deliberately started in the centre of the city. Soon the corniche was a wall of fire two miles long and a hundred feet high: the glow from the flames could be seen the other side of the Aegean on Mount Athos. Turkish and Jewish quarters were spared, most of Greek and Armenian Smyrna was burnt: while British French and Italian battleships watched, the corniche became a killing-field with âsuch frantic screaming of sheer terror as can be heard miles awayâ, according to George Ward Price, a journalist on HMS Iron Duke. The world failed to protect a world city. Those who had not been murdered or deported were taken by ships organised by American missionaries and foreign powers to Athens, Salonica, Alexandria or Beirut. By November no Greeks or Armenians remained. Nationalism had defeated Smyrnaâs combination of diplomacy, hybridity, commerce, modernity and pleasure. It is not, as Ben Gurion complained, the spirit of the Levant which âruins individuals and societiesâ. On the contrary. All nationalism corrupts, absolute nationalism corrupts absolutely. Smyrna had experienced the first city death of the twentieth century.\n\nThe Turkish commander Mustafa Kemal meanwhile was drinking raki and champagne on a hill above the city in the villa of the richest Turkish merchant of the city Muammar Bey Ushakligil. âlet it burn let it crash downâ he said to his hostâs daughter Latife Hanim, whom he was courting: words she subsequently verified with one of his ADCâs. Kemal found the city marble and left it ashes. The equestrian state of himself which he ordered to be erected where the Grand Hotel Kraemer Palace once stood is still there - a symbol of both the horrors and the achievements of the twentieth century.\n\nRelations between Greeks and Jews in Smyrna had not been good. On 8 January 1923, however, a Jewish teacher called E Benaroya wrote this Levantine lament: âLife in Smyrna has become worse than that we experienced in Morocco before the French occupation, a dull life, monotonous, without any material or moral distraction. Theatres, cinemas, cafes, the clubs where newspapers from the entire world were available, where we found every kind of instructive and agreeable distraction, all have disappeared, annihilated by the fireâ¦we live here like hermits, inflicted by every possible and imaginable kind of interdiction, impossible customs tariffs, in brief charged with expiating we longer know what sins of humanity. âBlackened heaps of stone and weed-choked rubble, the haunt of wandering goats, continued to disfigure the heart of Izmir into the 1950s. For a time the city was de-modernised. Smyrniots fled to London, Paris, Athens, Alexandria or Beirut.\n\nSmyrna had experienced an early and brutal form of the sectarianisation or ethnic cleansing imposed by other national states and sectarian leaders, in the twentieth century, on other mixed cities. The list is depressing: Salonica was hellenised after 1912; Odessa and Saint Petersburg russianised after 1917; Treiste italianised after 1918; Istanbul turkified after 1923; Vienna germanised after 1938; Prague czechified after 1945; Shanghai sinified after 1948; Alexandria egyptianised after 1956; Nicosia hellenised or turkified after 1960; Sarajevo divided into Bosniak, Serb and Croatian zones after 1993. A similar process is happening, as I speak, in formerly cosmopolitan and peaceful Aleppo, once distinguished, travellers noticed, by lack of tensions between its communities.17 Some see the process as inevitable. Others blame states and sects, which resent the diversity and freedoms of cities.\n\nIn 1942 Alexandria â which had witnessed riots in 1882, 1907 and 1919-21 - had withstood the trauma of approaching Axis armies, only sixty miles away. Egyptians saw their families to safety in the Delta then resumed working in the British naval and military bases. Boats supplying allied forces throughout the Mediterranean left every four minutes. There was less panic than in the Russian capital Moscow at the approach of Axis armies in 1941. After the French-British-Israeli invasion of 1956, however, Nasser, although himself born and educated in Alexandria, encouraged Alexandrians of European origin to leave. There are almost no Greeks left. Now Alexandria is more Islamic than Cairo, with a strong Salafi influence. Once called the âQueen of the Mediterraneanâ, it has become the capital of the Nile delta.\n\nDuring fifteen years of civil war after 1975, Beirut switched from the pursuit of profit and pleasure to murder. The army was weakened by sectarianism. People might be killed because of the religion on their identity card. Weeds burst through the asphalt on the main square. The âgreen line âdividing mainly Muslim west Beirut from mainly Christian east Beirut was literally a green line of rampant vegetation. Today, again, Beirut is threatened by the spill-over from the Syrian catastrophe and the weakness of the Lebanese army and police. In a recent survey of 18-25 year olds by the American University, one in three say they hate the young of other communities, and would refuse to marry them; all want to leave.\n\n9 The Past for the Future?\n\nIn the Levant, as in Europe, cities have been as important as states or classes in shaping people and events. In our new global age geography is biting back at history. Cities again defy states.\n\nCosmopolitanism reappears in new forms in different cities â or in the same cities. Like Vienna and Berlin, Odessa and St Petersburg, Istanbul and Shanghai, Smyrna, Alexandria and Beirut are now trying to revive their pre-1914 cosmopolitan identities as cities welcoming to foreigners.\n\nâThe city will always pursue youâ, wrote Cavafy.\n\nâYou will walk\n\nthe same streets, grow old in the same neighbourhoods\n\nwill turn grey in these same houses.\n\nYou will always end up in this city.â\n\nOr as Maria Iliou said in her 2012 film Smyrna the Destruction of a Cosmopolitan City 1900-1922: âCosmopolitan cities never cease to exist even if they travel elsewhere. You carry Smyrna wherever you areâ¦ Smyrna is a notionâ.\n\nThe long Levantine farewell is over. Istanbul itself, almost entirely Turkish by 1975 after the expulsion of almost all its Greeks, is again, as it was before 1914, a global business city. For the first time since it was banned in 1943, it allows carnival revellers to wind through the streets near Madame Despina: âthe only public carnival in the Muslim worldâ.\n\nIzmir and the coasts of Turkey are bastions of the secular CHP party against the increasingly dictatorial Islamist government of Turkey. The Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan calls it âGavur Izmirâ or infidel Izmir. In other cities the muezzin is deafening; in central Izmir almost inaudible â at least for the moment. At a conference on Levantines organised by the Izmir Chamber of Commerce in October 2010, I was told by Ekrem Dermirtas: âEvery day we feel the pressureâ¦I fear for my daughterâs futureâ; but also âIzmir is the city of toleranceâ¦We make every effort at the Chamber of Commerce to preserve this [Levantine] culture. â¦I want to live life as a Levantineâ. A Levant United football club has been formed, a Levantine web site established and a Levantine cook-book published. Exhibitions on its cosmopolitan past were recently held, in Athens, London and Izmir itself.\n\nFurther east in Turkey, Mersin, another once predominantly Christian port (eight churches, five mosques, one synagogue before 1922), also wants to reassert its cosmopolitan identity. A dynamic free port, less Islamic than Istanbul, in 2011 it was twinned with Alexandria.\n\nBy its continued hybridity, multilingualism, modernity and vulnerability and by the continued importance of foreign powers in its internal affairs â shown by the choice of an international tribunal to investigate the murder of Hariri - Beirut is the last great Levantine city with the fragrance of freedom. The weight of the state is less oppressive than in London or New York. It has thirty-seven universities, most of them foreign. There is still a major French newspaper, LâOrient Le Jour, and many Lebanese write in French and speak it at home. Indeed Beirut is becoming more international. It has received Syrian, Armenian, Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. ÃmigrÃ©s from Egypt, Syria and Iraq have helped the business boom. India and the Philippines now contribute thousands of workers. In the global economy, this mixed character, rather than being a weakness, may be an asset. The Prime Minister Saad Hariri said in 2010, âParity will stay for everâ. Beirut shines in comparison with Aleppo, Damascus and Baghdad. Tourists and some inhabitants admire its âferocious edgeâ, its ability to combine wildly different visions of life. A balance of power and numbers between communities makes it an experimental laboratory for the future of the Middle East.18\n\nThe Levant is no longer limited to the eastern Mediterranean. In two ways todayâs global cities, London, Paris, New York, and Dubai, are new Levantine cities. First they have welcomed thousands from Smyrna, Beirut and Alexandria themselves. They include Mohammed al Fayed, Alain de Botton, Omar Sharif and Sir Ronald Cohen founder of AIPAX, from Alexandria; Alec Issigonis (the designer of the Mini) and Edouard Balladur, from Smyrna; the many Beirutis who have settled in Paris, such as the poet Adonis, and the Hariri family. âAs the spaces for diversity [and career opportunities for educated liberals] in the Middle East shrink, they open up in London and other Western citiesâ writes Sami Zubaida, himself a Jewish refugee from Baghdad, another former Ottoman mixed city. Businesses, churches, restaurants and galleries show what London has gained at the expense of the Levant.19\n\nSecond, London, Paris, New York, Hong Kong and other global cities, are repeating the patterns of the past. Like Levantine cities, they are increasingly different from their hinterlands. They too act as educators, liberators and modernisers. They too put deals before ideals; contain mosques, churches and synagogues, and international institutions; are devoted to trade, pleasure and hybridity, and use international languages. New York is headquarters of the United Nations. Paris signs and announcements are often in French, Spanish and English.\n\nLondon after 1945 appeared to be a dying city Now it is transformed into Babylondon, where 350 languages are spoken (probably more than in New York where the estimate is 170). The Prime Minister boasts that is is âthe most diverse city in the worldâ. As President Obama â himself from a multiethnic and multicultural background - said in London in 2012 of the US and UK, âOur patchwork heritage is an enormous strength.â According to the latest figures the population of 8.2 million is 45% white British; 18% Asian; 13% black; 13% European; 9% other foreign. Despite competition from new York, it is often described as âthe new capital of the worldâ, âthe undisputed capital of the worldââ âA first rate city with a second rate state attached.â London now has law courts for Russians who, like people in the Levant, consider foreign courts cheaper and less corrupt than their own. The Mayor Boris Johnson â like many ambitious mayors in other global cities - wants the city to control its own stamp duty, business rates and council tax and even visas: he calls it âa political giant but a fiscal infantâ.21\n\nThese new Levantine cities also have hybrid inhabitants, as Levantine cities once did. Nedim Gursel a French-speaking author from Turkey thinks of himself as living in âParistanbulâ. Amin Maalouf from Lebanon also lives in Paris and writes in French. His Des identites meurtrieres, published in Paris in 1998, with its attack on nationalism and call for trilingualism, is a Levantine manifesto. Hanif Kureishi, whose father came from Pakistan, calls London, where he writes, âa semi-independent city no longer part of Britainâ.22 We are all Levantines now.\n\nThanks to its creative freedom, broad perspectives, and relatively independent university, legal system and business standards, Hong Kong â which presents itself as âwhere China meets the worldâ and remains a âspecial administrative regionâ - is becoming increasingly different from its Chinese hinterland. An oasis of academic freedom, and a world leader in education (like two other East Asian ports, Shanghai and Singapore), it is also learning to value its colonial past.23 A former British colony has given greater freedom, and dignity, to its inhabitants than the Chinese national state. The colonial era flag is sometimes flown at anti-Peking protests.24\n\nDubai â where locally born people from at most 10% of the population - is not only one of the largest and most efficient ports in the world, and a regional financial centre, but thanks in part to the Art Dubai fair founded in 2006, is also acquiring a role as a centre of artistic freedom. Showing Levantine citiesâ characteristics of hybridity, modernity and freedom, Dubai has become a city where inhabitants of other gulf states can âair taboosâ: âa safe place for unsafe ideasâ. âThe only debate on politics we have here is under the umbrella of artâ, says Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi.25\n\nAs we approach the âuniversal cosmopolitan existenceâ prophesied by Kant in 1784, hopefully our global cities will be less vulnerable than their Levantine predecessors. All depends on the state. If global cities continue to be supported by states, if armies and police forces protect rather than attacking or ignoring the inhabitants, the future belongs to mixed cities with the energy and freedom of cosmopolitanism, rather than to inland capitals dominated by their âmilitary-industrial complexâ: to Beirut not Damascus; Istanbul not Ankara; Dubai not Riyadh; Hong Kong not Beijing; New York not Washington. States are dinosaurs: cities are the future.\n\nI would like to conclude with the prophetic words of a historian of ancient Gaul and Bordeaux, Camille Jullian. Here the nineteenth century speaks to the twenty-first, across the horrors of the twentieth. Bordeaux shared many characteristics of Levantine cities including powerful foreign merchants, love of pleasure, difference from the hinterland and a preference for trade over patriotism, clearly expressed on 12 March 1814 when it rose against Napoleon and welcomed an Anglo-Portuguese army as liberators. In his great history of Bordeaux, published in 1899, Jullian wrote: âtoday in face of an absolute and monotonous State, in face of even colder and more despotic international ideas, the municipal spirit can become, in the same way as family life and love of the soil, the safeguard of human liberty and dignityâ.26 We should not only cultivate our gardens. We should also cultivate our cities.\n\nPhilip Mansel is a historian of France and the Middle East.
