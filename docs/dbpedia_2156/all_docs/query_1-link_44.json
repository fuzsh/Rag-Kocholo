        "meta_description": "High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western countries1,2. However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have different effects on human health4,5. However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127&nbsp;population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6&nbsp;million individuals aged 18&nbsp;years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200&nbsp;countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol—which is a marker of cardiovascular risk—changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95% credible interval 3.7&nbsp;million–4.2&nbsp;million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world. From 1980 to 2018, the levels of total and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreased in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe.",

        "text": "Our aim was to estimate trends in mean total, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol for 200 countries and territories (Supplementary Table 2). We used non-HDL cholesterol rather than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol because most studies in our analysis had measured total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, from which non-HDL cholesterol can be calculated through subtraction. By contrast, LDL cholesterol was directly measured in only around 14% of studies. When LDL cholesterol is not directly measured, its calculation requires data on triglycerides, which were available in approximately 64% of the studies. Furthermore, the most-commonly used estimation method—that is, the Friedewald equation—can be inaccurate, particularly at high levels of triglycerides34. Non-HDL and LDL cholesterol were highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.94) in studies with data on both variables (Extended Data Fig. 9), because LDL cholesterol constitutes most of non-HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, non-HDL cholesterol predicts IHD risk at least as well as LDL cholesterol5,35, and can be measured at a lower cost than LDL cholesterol, which is relevant for how widely it can be used in low- and middle-income countries. Although non-HDL cholesterol is now commonly used in clinical guidelines36,37,38, LDL cholesterol continues to be a key target for treatment36,37, possibly because the interpretation of non-HDL cholesterol is more complex than LDL cholesterol alone. Specifically, an increase in non-HDL cholesterol could be due to the increase in LDL cholesterol or very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol39. Furthermore, there is some evidence that triglyceride levels are high in Asian populations, compared to levels seen in high-income western countries40. Therefore, data on non-HDL cholesterol can motivate dietary interventions to both reduce LDL cholesterol (for example, reducing saturated and trans fat intake) and triglyceride levels (for example, reducing refined carbohydrates and increasing omega-3 fatty acids) as well as treatments that lower LDL cholesterol (statins), alongside those that lower triglycerides (for example, fibrates).\n\nData sources\n\nWe used a database of population-based data on cardiometabolic risk factors collated by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), a worldwide network of health researchers and practitioners that systematically monitors the worldwide trends and variations in non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors. The database was collated through multiple routes for identifying and accessing data. We accessed publicly available population-based multi-country and national measurement surveys (for example, Demographic and Health Surveys and surveys identified through the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research and European Health Interview & Health Examination Surveys Database). We requested, via the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional and country offices, from ministries of health and other national health and statistical agencies to identify and access population-based surveys. Requests were also sent via the World Heart Federation to its national partners. We made a similar request to the co-authors of an earlier pooled analysis of cardiometabolic risk factors7,41,42,43, and invited the co-authors of the analysis to reanalyse data from their studies and join NCD-RisC. Finally, to identify major sources that were not accessed through the above routes, we searched and reviewed published studies as described in the Supplementary Information and invited all eligible studies to join NCD-RisC.\n\nFor each data source, we recorded the available information about the study population, start year and duration of measurement, sampling approach and measurement methods. The information about study population was used to establish that each data source was population-based, and to assess whether it covered the whole country, multiple subnational regions or one or a small number of communities, and whether it was rural, urban or combined.\n\nWe carefully checked all data sources in terms of how they met our inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. We identified duplicate data sources by comparing studies from the same country and year. Additionally, all NCD-RisC members are asked periodically to review the list of sources from their country, to suggest additional sources not in the database, and to verify that the included data meet the inclusion criteria listed below and are not duplicates. The NCD-RisC database is continuously updated through the above routes and through regular contact with NCD-RisC members.\n\nAnonymized individual record data from sources included in NCD-RisC were reanalysed according to a common protocol. Within each survey, we included participants aged 18 years and older who were not pregnant. We removed participants with implausible total cholesterol levels (defined as total cholesterol levels of <1.75 mmol l−1 or >20 mmol l−1, or total cholesterol values that were lower than HDL cholesterol values) (<0.05% of all participants with total cholesterol measurements) or HDL cholesterol levels (defined as HDL cholesterol levels of <0.4 mmol l−1 or >5 mmol l−1, or total cholesterol values that were lower than HDL cholesterol values) (<0.15% of all participants with HDL cholesterol measurements). When data on LDL cholesterol were also available, we removed individuals for whom the sum of LDL and HDL cholesterol level surpassed total cholesterol level by more than is plausible based on the limits to errors in their measurement (following the CDC Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) standards, these errors were set at 8.9% for total cholesterol, 13% for HDL cholesterol and 12% for LDL cholesterol) (<0.06% of all participants with total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol measurements)44,45,46.\n\nWe calculated mean total cholesterol, mean HDL cholesterol and mean non-HDL cholesterol, and associated standard errors and sample sizes, by sex and age group (18–19 years, 20–29 years, followed by 10-year age groups and 80+ years). All analyses incorporated appropriate sample weights and complex survey design in calculating age–sex-specific means when applicable. To ensure summaries were prepared according to the study protocol, computer code was provided to NCD-RisC members who requested assistance. All submitted data were checked independently by at least two researchers. Questions and clarifications were discussed with NCD-RisC members and resolved before the data were incorporated in the database.\n\nFinally, we obtained data not accessed through the above routes by extracting data from published reports of all additional national health surveys identified through the above-described strategies, as well as eight sites of the WHO Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease (MONICA) project that were not deposited in the MONICA Data Centre. Data were extracted from published reports only when reported by sex and in age groups no wider than 20 years. We also used data from a previous pooling study7 when such data did not overlap with those accessed through the above routes.\n\nData inclusion and exclusion\n\nData sources were included in NCD-RisC database if: (1) measured data on total, LDL, HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides were available; (2) study participants were 10 years of age or older; (3) data were collected using a probabilistic sampling method with a defined sampling frame; (4) data were from population samples at the national, subnational (covering one or more subnational regions, more than three urban communities or more than five rural communities) or community (one or a small number of communities) level; (5) data were collected in or after 1950; and (6) data were from the countries and territories listed in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nWe excluded all data sources that included only hypercholesterolaemia or dyslipidaemia diagnosis history or medication status without measurement of cholesterol levels. We also excluded data sources on population subgroups for which the lipid profile may differ systematically from the general population, including: (1) studies that had included or excluded people on the basis of their health status or cardiovascular risk; (2) studies for which the participants were only from ethnic minorities; (3) studies that had recruited only specific educational, occupational or socioeconomic subgroups, with the exception noted below; and (4) studies that had recruited participants through health facilities, with the exception noted below.\n\nWe used school-based data in countries and for age–sex groups, for which secondary school enrolment was 70% or higher. We used data for which the sampling frame was health insurance schemes in countries in which at least 80% of the population was insured. Finally, we used data collected through general practice and primary-care systems in high-income and central European countries with universal insurance, because contact with the primary-care systems tends to be as good as or better than response rates for population-based surveys. We used data sources regardless of fasting status, because the differences between fasting and non-fasting measurements are negligible for total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol39, and therefore non-fasting lipid profiles are now widely endorsed for the estimation of cardiovascular risk36,37.\n\nData used in the analysis\n\nFor this paper, we used data from the NCD-RisC database for years 1980 to 2018 and individuals aged 18 years and older. A list of the data sources that we used in this analysis and their characteristics is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The data comprised 1,127 population-based measurement surveys and studies that included measurements of blood lipids on 102.6 million participants aged 18 years and older. We had at least one data source for 161 of the 200 countries that we made estimates for, covering 92.4% of the world’s population in 2018 (Extended Data Fig. 1); and at least two data sources for 104 countries (87.5% of the world population). Of these 1,127 sources, 409 (36.3%) sampled from national populations, 250 (22.2%) covered one or more subnational regions, and the remaining 468 (41.5%) were from one or a small number of communities. Regionally, data availability ranged from around 2 data sources per country in sub-Saharan Africa to approximately 35 sources per country in the high-income Asia–Pacific region. In total, 454 data sources (40.3%) were from years before 2000 and the remaining 673 (59.7%) were collected from 2001 onwards.\n\nAdjusting for the differences in mean cholesterol between portable device and laboratory measurements\n\nIn 112 (10%) of the 1,127 data sources used in our analysis (11.5% and 5.8% of age–sex-specific data points for total and HDL cholesterol, respectively) lipids were measured using a portable device. Some portable devices have narrower analytical ranges than laboratory methods, which results in truncations of blood cholesterol data that are outside their range (Supplementary Table 3). This may in turn affect the population mean. Although cholesterol concentrations that fall outside the analytical range are displayed as ‘high’ (above the measurement range) or ‘low’ (below the measurement range) by these devices, different surveys record and code cholesterol concentrations outside the analytical range in different ways, for example using ‘too low’, ‘too high’ and ‘error’ codes; assigning the minimum or maximum value to individuals whose cholesterol was below or above the analytical range, respectively; setting values outside the analytical range to missing; and so on. We used an approach that treated surveys with such data consistently.\n\nSpecifically, we first dropped all participants with cholesterol levels below and at the minimum, and at and above the maximum, values of the analytical range of each portable device before calculating the mean cholesterol (Supplementary Table 3). We then developed conversion regressions to adjust the mean cholesterol levels measured using a portable device (calculated over the restricted range, Supplementary Table 3) to the levels expected using laboratory measurements. The dependent variable in each regression was mean total, non-HDL or HDL cholesterol for the full range, and the main independent variable was mean total, non-HDL or HDL cholesterol over the above-mentioned restricted cholesterol range of the portable devices. The regression coefficients were estimated from data sources for which lipids were measured in a laboratory, and thus had the full range of measurement and could be used to calculate both dependent and independent variables. When estimating the regression coefficients, we constructed the dependent variable using the full data, and the independent variable by dropping the values outside the above-mentioned restricted cholesterol range of each device, mimicking those that would be expected if a portable device had been used. Separate models were developed according to the specific range of the different portable devices. All regressions included terms for age and sex, as well as interactions between predictors and age and sex, based on the Bayesian information criterion47. The regressions for mean non-HDL cholesterol also included mean total cholesterol and mean HDL cholesterol because non-HDL cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. We excluded data points for which there were fewer than 25 individuals for the purpose of estimating the coefficients of these regressions. All sources of uncertainty in the conversion—including the sampling uncertainty of the original data, the uncertainty of the regression coefficients and residuals—were carried forward by using repeated draws from their respective distributions. The regression coefficients and number of data points used to estimate the coefficients are shown in Supplementary Table 4.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe used a statistical model to estimate mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol by country, year, sex and age using all of the available data. The model is described in detail in a statistical paper and related substantive papers8,32,33,48; the computer code is available at http://www.ncdrisc.org/. In summary, we organized countries into 21 regions, mainly based on geography and national income; these regions were further aggregated into 9 ‘super-regions’ (Supplementary Table 2). The model had a hierarchical structure in which estimates for each country and year were informed by its own data, if available, and by data from other years in the same country and from other countries, especially countries in the same region or super-region with data for similar time periods. The extent to which estimates for each country-year are influenced by data from other years and other countries depends on whether the country has data, the sample size of data, whether or not they are national, and the within-country and within-region data variability. The model incorporated nonlinear time trends comprising linear terms and a second-order random walk. The age association of blood lipids was modelled using a cubic spline to allow nonlinear age patterns, which might vary across countries. The model accounted for the possibility that blood lipids in subnational and community samples might systematically differ from nationally representative ones; and/or have larger variation. These features were implemented by including data-driven fixed-effect and random-effect terms for subnational and community data. The fixed effects adjust for systematic differences between subnational or community studies and national studies. The random effects allow national data to have larger influence on the estimates than subnational or community data with similar sample sizes. The model also accounted for rural–urban differences in blood lipids, through the use of data-driven fixed effects for rural-only and urban-only studies. These rural and urban effects were weighted by the difference between study-level and country-level urbanization in the year in which the study was done. The proportion of the national population living in urban areas was also included as a predictor (covariate) in the model. The model for mean non-HDL and HDL cholesterol also used age-standardized mean total cholesterol as a covariate.\n\nWe fitted the statistical model with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and obtained 5,000 post-burn-in samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters, which were in turn used to obtain the posterior distributions of mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol. We calculated average change in mean total, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol across the 39 years of analysis (reported as change per decade). Age-standardized estimates were generated by taking weighted averages of age–sex-specific estimates, using the WHO standard population. Estimates for regions and the world were calculated as population-weighted averages of the constituent country estimates by age group and sex. The reported credible intervals represent the 2.5–97.5th percentiles of the posterior distributions. We also report the posterior probability that an estimated increase or decrease represents a truly increasing or decreasing trend as opposed to a chance observation. We performed all analyses by sex, because blood lipids levels and trends are different in men and women.\n\nValidation of statistical model\n\nWe tested how well our statistical model predicts missing data, known as external predictive validity, in two different tests. In the first test, we held out all data from 10% of countries with data (that is, created the appearance of countries with no data where we actually had data). The countries for which the data were withheld were randomly selected from the following three groups: data rich (5 or more data sources, with at least one data source after the year 2000), data poor (1 data source) and average data availability (2–4 data sources). In the second test, we assessed other patterns of missing data by holding out 10% of our data sources, again from a mix of data-rich, data-poor and average-data countries, as defined above. For a given country, we either held out a random half of the data of a country or all of the 2000–2018 data of the country to determine, respectively, how well we filled in the gaps for countries with intermittent data and how well we estimated in countries without recent data. In both tests, we then fitted the model to the remaining 90% of the countries (test 1) or data sources (test 2) and made estimates of the held-out observations. We repeated each test five times, holding out a different subset of data in each repetition. In both tests, we calculated the differences between the held-out data and the estimates. We also calculated the 95% credible intervals of the estimates; in a model with good external predictive validity, 95% of held-out values would be included in the 95% credible intervals.\n\nOur statistical model performed well in the external validation tests, that is, in estimating mean cholesterol when data were missing. The estimates of mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol were unbiased, as evidenced with median errors that were very close to zero globally for every outcome and test, and less than ±0.30 mmol l−1 in every subset of withheld data except for women in the high-income Asia–Pacific region in test 1 for non-HDL cholesterol (median error 0.47 mmol l−1) and men in south Asia in test 2 for non-HDL cholesterol (median error −0.33 mmol l−1) (Supplementary Table 5). The 95% credible intervals of estimated means covered 83–92% and 75–83% of true data globally in the first and second tests, respectively. In subsets, coverage ranged from 47% to 100%, but was mostly greater than 75%, with coverage generally lower in test 2 than test 1. Median absolute errors ranged from 0.07 to 0.23 mmol l−1 globally for different outcomes and sexes, and were no more than 0.45 mmol l−1 in all subsets of withheld data, except for women in the high-income Asia–Pacific region for non-HDL cholesterol in test 1 (median absolute error 0.47 mmol l−1).\n\nCalculation of the number of deaths attributable to high cholesterol\n\nWe estimated the number of deaths from IHD and ischaemic stroke attributable to high non-HDL cholesterol. For each country, year, sex and age group, we first calculated the population attributable fractions—that is, the proportion of deaths from IHD and ischaemic stroke that would have been prevented if non-HDL cholesterol levels were at an optimal level (defined as a mean of 1.8–2.2 mmol l−1) in the population6,49. For these calculations, we used age-specific relative risks from meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies4,5,50. The number of IHD and ischaemic stroke deaths attributable to high non-HDL cholesterol was calculated for each country–year–age–sex group by multiplying the cause-specific population attributable fractions by the cause-specific deaths from the Global Burden of Disease study in 1990 and 2017 (the earliest and latest years with cause-specific mortality data).\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThe strengths of our study include its scope in making consistent and comparable estimates of trends in blood cholesterol and its cardiovascular disease mortality burden, over almost four decades for all of the countries in the world, including global estimates of non-HDL and HDL cholesterol. We used a large amount of population-based data, which came from countries in which 92% of the global adult population lives. We used only data from studies that had measured blood lipids to avoid bias in self-reported data. Data were analysed according to a consistent protocol, and the characteristics and quality of data from each country were rigorously verified through repeated checks by NCD-RisC members. We pooled data using a statistical model that took into account the epidemiological features of cholesterol, including nonlinear time trends and age associations. Our statistical model used all available data while giving more weight to national data than to subnational and community sources.\n\nSimilar to all global analyses, our study is affected by some limitations. Despite our extensive efforts to identify and access worldwide population-based data, some countries had no or few data sources, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, central Asia and Melanesia. Estimates for these countries relied mostly or entirely on the statistical model, which shares information across countries and regions through its hierarchy. Data scarcity is reflected in wider uncertainty intervals of our estimates for these countries and regions, highlighting the need for national NCD-oriented surveillance. The distribution of lipids measured in a population using a portable device, which was used in 10% of our studies, may be truncated and may therefore affect the population mean. To overcome this issue, we developed conversion regressions to adjust mean cholesterol levels measured using a portable device to the levels expected in laboratory measurements; the conversion regressions used for this purpose had good predictive accuracy. Although most studies had measured cholesterol in serum samples, around 7% had used plasma samples. As cholesterol measured in plasma and serum samples differ51 by only about 3%, adjusting for plasma-serum differences would have little effect on our results, as seen in a previous analysis14. Although methods to measure total and HDL cholesterol have evolved over time, since the 1950s there have been systematic efforts to standardize lipid measurements that have resulted in increased comparability between different methods. In our analysis, 90% of studies measured lipids in a laboratory; of these studies more than 60% for total cholesterol and more than 70% for HDL cholesterol participated in a lipid standardization programme or quality control scheme. We did not analyse emerging lipid markers such as apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I, because they are neither commonly measured in population-based health surveys, nor routinely used in clinical practice36.\n\nComparison with other studies\n\nThere are no global analyses on trends in lipid fractions for comparison with our results. Our findings for total cholesterol were largely consistent with the only other previous analysis7, but we estimated a larger decrease in mean total cholesterol in high-income western countries and central Europe, and a larger increase in southeast Asia, because we had an additional decade of data compared with the earlier global analysis. Therefore, although the highest mean total cholesterol levels reported previously7, for 2008, were still in high-income western countries, we estimated that in 2018 total cholesterol was equally high or higher in southeast Asia. Our findings on mean total cholesterol trends are also largely consistent with previous multi- and single-country reports14,15,17,18,19,20,21,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73. Differences from previous studies—for example, in Italy61, Lithuania63, the Netherlands65, Russian Federation69 and in some countries that participated in the MONICA Project52—mostly arise because our study covered a longer period and used a larger number of data sources. Studies15,18,54,63,66,70,74,75,76,77 that have reported trends in lipid fractions for a period longer than 15 years have found changes in non-HDL cholesterol (or in LDL cholesterol for some studies) that were consistent with our results.\n\nReporting summary"
