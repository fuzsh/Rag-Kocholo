        "text": "Louis-Philippe, known as the “citizen king” or “bourgeois king” was a direct descendant of both Louis XIV and his brother Philippe. (His great great grandfather, son of Philippe married one of Louis XIV’s daughters by his mistress Madame de Montespan).\n\nLouis-Philippe’s father, the Duke of Orleans, had joined the French Revolution and voted in favour of executing Louis XVI. Louis-Philippe was exiled by the revolutionaries and travelled around Europe and America before settling in England where he worked as a teacher. He married Princess Marie-Amelie, daughter of the King of Naples. Her mother was initially opposed to the idea, given that she was Marie-Antoinette’s sister and Louis-Philippe’s father was regarded as having a role in her death. Louis-Philippe managed to win her over.\n\nThe couple settled into a palace in Palermo in Sicily where the first three of their ten children were born.\n\nWhen Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon kings reinstated, Louis-Philippe returned to Paris. His family’s properties, including Palais Royal, were all returned to him.\n\nLouis-Philippe was more in touch with the middle classes than the returned Bourbon monarchs. Charles X introduced repressive measures, including censorship of the press and altering the election system. When Charles was forced to abdicate Louis-Philippe was made King of the French (as opposed to “King of France” as all the Kings had been known).\n\nLouis-Philippe moved into the Tuileries Palace. He slept in Charles X’s bed, which he had enlarged. Unlike previous kings, and as could be expected of a “bourgeois” king, he actually shared a bed with his wife. He mostly reused the existing beds in the royal residences.\n\nLouis-Philippe undertook extensive work on the former royal residences. It was his decision to turn the Chateau of Versailles into a museum dedicated to the history of France. He regularly visited to oversee the works.\n\nThe former kitchens of the Grand Trianon were converted into an apartment for him to stay and work in. He had a day bed in his cabinet which overlooked the Grand Canal. An important feature of the initial makeover was a bathroom and separate toilet (the first of four he included in that section).\n\nAn apartment in the same section was prepared for Louis-Philippe’s sister Madame Adelaide.\n\nWhen he had prepared the rest of he Grand Trianon for the family stays, he shared a bed with Marie-Amelie in her apartment (the former Empress’ apartment—see “A Shared Bed”).\n\nApartments for his children were mostly set up with furniture left over from Napoleon.\n\nHis youngest daughter Clementine used a section of Napoleon’s private apartments. The other section was given to her sister Marie, whose marriage took place at the Grand Trianon. Later Louis-Philippe furnished a bedroom for his eldest daughter Louise who had married the King of the Belgians."
