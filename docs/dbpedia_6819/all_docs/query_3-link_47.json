        "text": "AMERICAN COMMUNITY SCHOOL\n\nOF ABU DHABI\n\nAnnual Report 2015-2016\n\nProviding excellence in education since 1972\n\nthrough values of courage, curiosity, compassion and integrity\n\nIdentity Statement\n\nThe American Community School of Abu Dhabi is a non-profit, U.S. accredited, college preparatory school. Our\n\nAmerican, standards-based curriculum provides excellence in academics, the arts, athletics, and service.\n\nVision\n\nTogether we are a compassionate, student-centered community of learners that engages, prepares, and inspires.\n\nMission\n\nThe American Community School of Abu Dhabi provides a balanced learning program to foster excellence in academ-\n\nics, the arts, and athletics. In partnership with parents, we empower all students to define and shape their futures.\n\nOur dynamic and challenging educational program prepares a culturally diverse student body for learning, service,\n\nand global citizenship.\n\nCore Values\n\nCompassion\n\nCourage\n\nIntegrity\n\nCuriosity\n\nDear ACS Community,\n\nThis inaugural ACS Annual Report is intended to highlight the achievements of the 2015-2016\n\nschool year and report on our annual financial position. This report will be updated following the\n\ncompletion of an external audit that confirms our school’s financial status.\n\nDuring the past year, the Superintendent and the Board of Trustees worked in partnership to open the\n\nnew Upper Elementary School building.This addition reunited siblings at ACS and increased our student\n\nbody to 1,200 students. To improve our outdoor space, the ACS Board of Trustees launched an Annual\n\nFund campaign to raise 1 million AED to build an amphitheater, improve our walkways, and enhance\n\nplaygrounds for our students. Due to the extreme generosity of our parent and Alumni community, along\n\nwith our most successful gala to date,ACS raised 1.1 million AED towards these campus enhancements.\n\nAlthough campus improvements are ongoing, ACS exceptionalism is a product of our diverse and\n\ncurious student body. The statistics in this Annual Report demonstrate that our students excel\n\nacademically, athletically, and creatively. What is less evident from the numbers is their commitment\n\nto be curious and responsible world citizens who have the courage to act with compassion and\n\nintegrity. Not only did ACS students complete more than 12,000 service hours last year, Middle and\n\nHigh School students created their own service clubs that they operated independently. Their efforts\n\nyielded substantial contributions to improve the lives of people around the world they have never\n\nmet. Our Administration and Board of Trustees are proud of our students and, we are grateful that\n\nthey give our work purpose and meaning.\n\nAn outstanding staff supported our students’ accomplishments. Our campus awakens well before\n\nthe opening school bell and remains busy well after classes end, as teachers meet with students\n\nand parents before and after school, coach our teams, and direct our plays and musical performances.\n\nThe significant role our staff plays in the lives of our children is verified by the fact that our students\n\noverwhelmingly express the view that ACS teachers care about them.\n\nWe recognize that the spirit of scholarship, excellence, and altruism emanates from a strong foundation\n\nlaid by our parent community. Not only did our parents support motivated, inquisitive, and\n\ncompassionate children, they were actively involved in the numerous and wonderful PTA-sponsored\n\nevents such as the Fall Festival, Holiday Extravaganza, International Day, the Gala, book fairs, and the\n\nalways popular snow cone sales. The parent liaisons and incredible Viper Club members were ever-\n\npresent and vital in supporting students and teachers, as well as amplifying the ACS Viper spirit. The\n\nparental and student involvement at these events makes ACS a “community” school.\n\nThe 2015-2016 academic year was one of growth and expansion. The ACS Board of Trustees and\n\nthe Leadership Team are committed to ensuring that ACS, with its deep history since 1972, is\n\ncontinually innovating and advancing. We look forward to working with students, staff, parents,\n\nand the broader Abu Dhabi community to define the future of ACS, its role in the lives of our\n\nstudents and Abu Dhabi, and to ensure that ACS continues to empower students to conceive and\n\nshape their own futures.\n\nRobin Heslip, Ph.D. Leslie Bellas\n\nSuperintendent Chairperson • ACS Board of Trustees\n\n02\n\nDear ACS Community,\n\nBeing members of some of the first ACS graduating classes is an honor. We feel the skills we\n\nlearned and the relationships we developed, have been invaluable in our lives.\n\nJust as Abu Dhabi has transformed from a quiet town to an exceptional global city, ACS has grown\n\nand improved as well. When we visit the campus, we see students excelling in all areas: academics,\n\nathletics, arts, and service. As they challenge themselves in these areas, we also notice that they\n\ndo so with the same joyful camaraderie that we remember so well. ACS students love to learn and\n\nrefuse to settle for less than their best.\n\nWe believe that our early years of achievement laid the foundation for the exceptional students we\n\nnow see graduating.To enhance the relationship between Alumni and ACS, we, with Superintendent\n\nDr. Robin Heslip, have founded an Alumni Board. Serving on the newly formed Alumni Board is a\n\nway for us to give back to ACS a fraction of what it has given us. Now that the foundation for\n\nan Alumni Association has been laid, we ask that you join with us to enhance our legacy and\n\nstrengthen the future of this unique institution.\n\nOur Father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in his great wisdom, said, “A country’s greatest\n\ninvestment lies in building generations of educated and knowledgeable youth.” Together, we can\n\nhelp make his vision a lasting reality.\n\nHaitham Zamzam Al Hammadi\n\nACS Alumni Board Co-Chair\n\nSaud Al Nowais\n\nACS Alumni Board Co-Chair\n\nPhotos of alumni, circa 1979 03\n\n126There are\n\n17\n\nfaculty members\n\nrepresenting nationalities.\n\n5Teachers stay at the school for an average of years.\n\n20 32 ACS teachers have\n\nor more years of teaching experience.\n\n15 27 ACS teachers have\n\nyears of teaching experience.\n\n04\n\nFACULTY\n\nThe American Community School has achieved a strong reputation with the international school\n\ncommunity largely due to the strength and diversity of our faculty.\n\nOur faculty is an extremely knowledgeable, talented, and experienced group of individuals with a\n\npassion for educating global learners.While excellence in the classroom is their priority, our teachers\n\ncan also be found coaching and mentoring on campus through our after school programs,\n\nproductions, and trips.\n\nFACULTY TURNOVER BY YEAR\n\n2015/2016 Faculty 11%\n\n2014/2015 Faculty 16%\n\n2013/2014 Faculty 5%\n\n2012/2013 Faculty 28%\n\n2011/2012 Faculty 18%\n\nDEGREES EARNED BY OUR FACULTY\n\n40 5Doctorates\n\nBachelors 81Masters 05\n\n06\n\nSTUDENT ACHIEVEMENTS 07\n\nOur international student body of more than 1200 students, representing 60 countries,\n\nreceives an excellent American curriculum education. Since 1972, ACS has prepared and\n\nempowered a culturally diverse student body for learning, service, and global citizenship.\n\nThe American Community School of Abu Dhabi is accredited by the Middle States Association\n\nof Colleges and Schools, which is a voluntary, peer-based, non-profit association. MSA\n\npreforms peer evaluation and accreditation of public and private secondary/high schools and\n\nelementary schools in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and certain foreign institutions of\n\nAmerican origin. ACS is also authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organization to\n\noffer the IB Diploma Program in grades 11 and 12. This is a rigorous academic program\n\nrecognized by most universities around the world.\n\nThe faculty at ACS supports each student in their quest for academic excellence, artistic, and\n\nathletic expression and international understanding.\n\nATHLETICS\n\n366 ACS athletes participated in 31 team sports in U14, JV, and Varsity levels. In addition\n\nto a multitude of medals, they were awarded 17 sportsmanship awards over the course of\n\nthe year. This last achievement speaks strongly to their comprehension of ACS Core Values of\n\nCourage, Curiosity, Compassion, and Integrity.\n\nARTS\n\nThroughout the year theater productions, art exhibits and musical collaborations fill our\n\ncampus with creative energy. In addition to drama productions in every division, in 2015-\n\n2016 our students participated in the MESAC Fine Arts Festivals, city-wide art exhibitions,\n\nand the senior art students produced a stellar IB Art show. The middle school hallway is an\n\never-changing display of artistic talent, and the elementary school atrium showcased several\n\nart exhibits including color field studies, clay creations, and “found object” art. The ACS music\n\nprogram is a vibrant part of the ACS community. Our musicians share their talents in the\n\nnumerous events and concerts throughout the year. They support the musicals, participate in\n\nregional festivals, and are chosen to take part in the competitive AMIS Honor ensembles.The\n\nAMIS Honor ensembles include students from international schools throughout the world.\n\nOur music students also participate in master classes and open rehearsals with the world’s\n\nleading soloists and music ensembles.\n\nSERVICE LEARNING\n\nService is a strong cornerstone of our ACS community ethos. Both locally and globally, High\n\nSchool students participated in over 12,000 hours of service learning during 2015-\n\n2016. Our students’ IB CAS projects reflected a strong understanding of global issues.\n\nElementary students continue to be leaders in service, through their participation in the\n\nJane Goodall Roots and Shoots program. ACS established the first branch of the Roots and\n\nShoots program in the UAE. Middle School students display their compassion through their\n\nchoice of service projects with local UAE charities, Operation Smile, and an ongoing\n\nrelationship with a village in Thailand during their Week Without Walls program.\n\nSTUDENT PROFILE\n\nSTUDENT ENROLLMENT AT ACS AS OF AUGUST 25, 2016\n\nWith the completion of the new Upper Elementary School building in 2016, we were able to increase\n\nour enrollment capacity by 130 students.

In accordance\n\nwith this plan, several long term projects came to fruition during the 2015-2016 school year.\n\nThese improvements, collectively, added significantly to our facilities and programs.They include:\n\n• Completion of the new upper elementary school building,\n\nallowing enrollment to increase by 130 students, including many ACS student siblings.\n\n• Security enhancements,\n\nincluding a new id badge system, helping us monitor campus access.\n\n• New course offerings in all divisions,\n\nincluding television production, app development and design, computer science and\n\nengineering, dance, drama, and music.\n\n• Campus facility enhancements,\n\nincluding ES playground, underground structural support, new amphitheater, pool\n\nshading, playground shading, landscaping, and seating.\n\n• Summer Jassim playing field,\n\nwith a new Astroturf surface, long jump pit, and sprinting track.\n\n• Advancements in technology,\n\nadding robotics courses to KG and Middle School.\n\n13\n\n14 GIVING TO ACS\n\nThe ACS Board of Trustees and Leadership Team wish to express their gratitude to all donors\n\nfor 2015-2016. As a result of your generosity, our students’ experiences will be greatly\n\nenhanced. Thank you for your ongoing support.\n\nACS ANNUAL FUND\n\nThe ACS Strategic Plan identified the need for alternative revenue sources due to rising costs\n\nin Abu Dhabi, local restrictions on tuition increases, and a regulatory suspension of the one-\n\ntime capital fee, which resulted in a AED 4.5 M annual loss in revenue.\n\nIn response to this need, ACS launched its inaugural Annual Fund in 2015-2016, which raised\n\nAED 803,000 in donations from the generous support of ACS parents, faculty and staff,\n\nalumni and community. With a first year participation rate of 56% of the community, we look\n\nforward to an increase in participation in 2016-2017. A list of donors to the 2015-2016\n\nAnnual Fund is located on page 16.\n\nACS PTA GALA\n\nThe PTA generously donated AED 300,000 from Gala proceeds to support the 2016 summer\n\nenhancements.\n\n2016 Gala Sponsors:\n\nExclusive 2016 Gala Sponsor:\n\nDr. Firas Dental & Orthodontic Center\n\nGold Sponsor:\n\nLexington Group\n\nSilver Sponsor:\n\nParsons\n\nBronze Sponsors:\n\nSallama & Ahmed Al Sayegh\n\nAtlas Group\n\nBP Exploration\n\nRaytheon\n\nVenus Commercial Printing Press\n\nGo Vipers!

The\n\nimprovements now include an astroturf soccer field, sprint track, and long jump pit.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State Office of Overseas Schools provided a significant security grant. This\n\ngrant allowed ACS to enhance security through greater control and monitoring of people entering\n\nour campus.\n\nA restricted corporate gift of USD 30,000 was awarded to ACS by Exxon Corporation. This gift\n\nsupported our STEAM program and allowed us to widen the scope of our robotics program. We\n\nwere also able to establish a collaborative relationship, through robotics, with the local Bangladeshi\n\nschool.\n\nThe Class of 2016 contributed a legacy gift of a charging station to the senior hallway and a gift to\n\nsupport the technology lab, which they hope will encourage innovation and learning at ACS.\n\n15\n\n2015-2016 ANNUAL FUND DONORS\n\n16 Abdelhaq, Samer and Sheraz
