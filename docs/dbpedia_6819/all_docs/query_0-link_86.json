        "text": "Results\n\nThe conditional ablation of Foxm1 in the developing telencephalon results in a decrease in cell proliferation and an abnormal AP pool\n\nTo elucidate the function of Foxm1 in the developing telencephalon, we first examined Foxm1 expression. Foxm1 mRNA is expressed at high levels throughout the neuroepithelium (E10.5–E16.5; Fig. 1A–D). Interestingly, high levels of Foxm1 expression were detected in the area of overlap between the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ; Fig. 1B–D, insets). We further performed in situ hybridization for Foxm1 combined with immunostaining for Tbr2, a marker of SVZ BPs, at E14.5. We detected Foxm1 mRNA in APs within the VZ but did not detect colocalization with Tbr2 (Fig. 1E). This expression pattern suggests possible roles for Foxm1 in cell proliferation and differentiation. Next, we conditionally disrupted Foxm1 in the developing dorsal telencephalon by crossing Foxm1fl/fl mice with an Emx1-Cre line. As expected, the level of Foxm1 mRNA was markedly reduced in the dorsal telencephalon (Fig. 1F,G); the expression of Foxm1 in the ventral telencephalon was unchanged (Fig. 1F).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that Foxm1 plays an important role in mitotic progression (Wang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011), suggesting that Foxm1 might be involved in the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the proliferative capacity of the neuronal progenitors using 1.5 h BrdU labeling. We detected a decreased number of BrdU-labeled progenitors in Foxm1 mutants (Fig. 1H–J). Furthermore, immunostaining for Pax6, a marker of APs in the VZ, was performed on E14.5. Foxm1 mutants showed a 12.9% decrease in the number of Pax6+ progenitors compared with the control (Fig. 1K–M). Together, these results suggest that Foxm1 is required for the proliferation of neuronal progenitors and the maintenance of the AP pool.\n\nDisruption of Foxm1 impairs INM in APs\n\nBased on the strong Foxm1 expression observed in the VZ and its role in regulating the cell cycle, we suspected that Foxm1 might play a role in INM. Because the total length of the cell cycle at E14.5 is ∼14–16 h, including a 4 h S phase, 2 h G2/M phase, and 8–10 h G1 phase, we performed BrdU labeling at time points from 0.5–14 h to track the locations of the nuclei at different phases of the cell cycle. The labeled nuclei of APs that were observed 30 min after BrdU injection were located in the basal zone of the VZ in both the control and Foxm1 mutants (Fig. 2A–A″), consistent with the known position of AP nuclei during S phase (Latasa et al., 2009). No obvious differences were detected at this point, except that the nuclei of mutant APs appeared to be more condensed than those of control APs. Surprisingly, none of the 1.5 h labeled nuclei in the mutants reached the apical surface, although a large portion of the labeled nuclei in the control animals did (Fig. 2B–B″). To more carefully measure nuclear migration, the entire cortex was divided into eight bins, and the number of nuclei in each bin was calculated. We found that in control cortices, 17.6 ± 2.9% of the nuclei migrated into bin 1; however, the percentage of basal-to-apical migrating nuclei in bin 1 was markedly decreased in the mutant (5.3 ± 1.7%; Fig. 2B′,B″). Meanwhile, the percentage of BrdU-labeled nuclei remaining in bin 3 was increased in the mutants (41.8 ± 2.1%) compared with the controls (33.0 ± 1.4%; Fig. 2B,B″). These results indicate that basal-to-apical nuclear migration is disturbed by the deletion of Foxm1. We then performed 5 h BrdU labeling. In the control animals, a large proportion (40 ± 3.3%) of BrdU-labeled nuclei had accumulated in bin 1, the apical zone, and only a small proportion (8.2 ± 0.6%) remained in bin 4, the basal area of the VZ (Fig. 2C,C″). In mutant animals, however, the nuclei were dispersed throughout the VZ, with 31 ± 1.4% reaching bin 1 and 13 ± 1.2% remaining in bin 4. There was an obvious slowing of basal-to-apical nuclear migration (Fig. 2C′,C″). Similar defects were also observed for the 1.5 h and 5 h BrdU labeling at both E12.5 and E16.5 (Fig. 2E–H′). Moreover, a 14 h BrdU labeling was performed to further analyze whether differences in migration exist at later time points in the cell cycle. A similar basal enrichment of BrdU-labeled nuclei was observed in both the controls and mutants, but the control animals displayed a population of BrdU-labeled nuclei at the apical surface, representing the first group of APs that had completed one cell cycle and entered a second G2 phase. In the Foxm1 mutants, all of the BrdU-labeled G2 phase nuclei remained located in the upper area, and none of them had arrived at the apical surface (Fig. 2D–D″). Together, these results indicate that Foxm1 is required for INM, especially basal-to-apical migration.\n\nINM is impaired, but not arrested, and APs are able to pass through M phase in Foxm1 mutants\n\nPrevious studies have shown that a chemical blockade of INM disperses mitotic nuclei from their normal apical locations to random sites throughout the VZ during M phase (Murciano et al., 2002; Del Bene et al., 2008). To investigate whether Foxm1 gene deletion would have similar consequences due to its arrest of INM, we performed a time course analysis with double staining for BrdU and phospho-histone H3 (PH3), an M phase marker that labels APs undergoing mitosis at the apical surface. After a 1.5 h BrdU injection, PH3+ nuclei were found at the apical surface in both the controls and mutants, and no randomly dispersed mitotic nuclei were observed in the VZ in the mutants, which indicated that INM was not blocked (Fig. 3G,H). In control animals, ∼89.7 ± 3.7% of PH3+ nuclei were colabeled with BrdU (Fig. 3A–A‴,C), indicating that these progenitors were poised to complete DNA synthesis at the onset of BrdU injection, passed through G2 phase and underwent mitosis within 1.5 h. As expected, no PH3 and BrdU double-labeled nuclei were observed in the Foxm1 mutants, as a result of impaired basal-to-apical nuclear migration (Fig. 3B–B‴,C). After a 5 h BrdU labeling, a smaller subset of BrdU-labeled nuclei reached the apical surface in the mutants, indicating that the basal-to-apical migration was slower, but all of the PH3+ nuclei were found to be colabeled with BrdU in both the controls and mutants (Fig. 3D–F).\n\nPrevious studies showed that Foxm1 is required for spindle assembly and centrosome replication (Costa, 2005; Wierstra and Alves, 2007; Xue et al., 2010). Foxm1-deficient hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2002) and myocardial cells (Ramakrishna et al., 2007) exhibit enlarged, polyploid nuclei as a result of mitotic arrest. To investigate whether mitotic progression was disrupted, we performed double staining for DAPI and PH3. Identical results were obtained from the controls and Foxm1 mutants. In prophase, the nuclei exhibited dispersed chromosomes, as shown by DAPI staining. The chromosomes were captured by spindle fibers, aligned at the equatorial plate and colabeled with PH3 during metaphase (Fig. 3I,J,I″,J″), and the chromatids were separated during anaphase (Fig. 3I‴,J‴). These data show that at least some Foxm1-deficient APs are competent to go through M phase, although there might be problems in M phase.\n\nCell-cycle parameters are abnormal, and the synchronization of APs during S and G2 phases is disturbed\n\nThe normal length of one cell cycle at E14.5 is ∼14–16 h. We performed a 14 h BrdU labeling to investigate whether Foxm1 disruption affects the total cell-cycle length. Double immunostaining for BrdU and Ki76, a marker of proliferating cells in all active phases of the cell cycle, showed that the fraction of BrdU+Ki76+ progenitors among all BrdU+ cells was 29.0 ± 1.3% in the control animals but 37.9 ± 2.1% in the mutants (Fig. 4A–C), indicating that a greater number of progen-itors remained in the cell cycle (Fig. 4B–B′) and that the cell cycle length might be longer in Foxm1 mutants than in controls. Because INM is dependent on cell cycle progression, we measured the S-phase duration using IdU and BrdU double labeling to precisely analyze the length of S phase, as previously described (Martynoga et al., 2005). The mice were first treated with IdU to label the progenitors in S phase. After 1.5 h, the mice were treated with BrdU. Thus, the progenitors that remained in S phase would be colabeled by BrdU and IdU, whereas those that had already left S phase and entered G2 would be BrdU−IdU+ (Fig. 4D). By calculating the length of S phase (Ts) using the formula Scell(BrdU+IdU+)Lcell(BrdU−IdU+)=TsTi(1.5h), we found that S phase was ∼2.7 h longer in the mutants (7.2 ± 0.2 h) than in the control mice (4.5 ± 0.3 h; Fig. 4E,F). Interestingly, the number of BrdU−IdU+ G2 phase progenitors in the mutants was lower than that in the controls (Fig. 4G), which meant that those progenitors without Foxm1 took more time to pass through S phase.\n\nThe increased proportion of BrdU+/Ki67+, together with the delayed apical-to-basal INM at the 14 h BrdU injection, raises the possibility that not only S phase, but also other phases of the cell cycle might also be affected in the Foxm1 mutants. To precisely measure the cell-cycle parameters, cumulative BrdU labeling was performed (Fig. 4P,P′), and the proportion of BrdU+ cells among all VZ cells was counted at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, and 28 h. As expected, the proliferative population in the VZ grew at a steady rate in both the control and Foxm1 mutant mice; however, the proportion of BrdU+ cells in the control was ∼10–18% higher than that of Foxm1 at each time point until 20 h (Fig. 4Q). Using linear regression, we were able to acquire a regression curve and calculate the cell-cycle parameters using the regression equation. As shown in Table 2, the length of S phase increased by 38.2% to 4.9 h compared with 3.5 h in the control, whereas the total length of the cell cycle (Tc) was 6.8 h longer in the Foxm1 mutants (20.8 h) than in the control (14 h). Moreover, the value of Tc − Ts, which represents the time that a proliferating, newly BrdU-injected AP takes to pass through G2, M, G1, and re-enter S phase, increased from 10.5 h in the control to 16 h in the Foxm1 mutants, which indicated that the lengths of both G2/M and G1 phase, as well as S phase, were prolonged. These results indicate that the entire cell cycle was affected after Foxm1 ablation. The difference in the S phase lengths determined in the BrdU/IdU double labeling and the cumulative BrdU labeling experiments may result from the different mathematical and statistical methods used; the length of S phase was directly calculated in the BrdU/IdU double-labeling experiments but was indirectly calculated from the regression equation in the cumulative labeling experiments following regression analysis (Nowakowski et al., 1989; Calegari et al., 2005).\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon was that, in the control animals, a large portion of the BrdU−IdU+ G2 phase nuclei had separated from the BrdU+IdU+ S phase nuclei and arrived at the apical surface; however, in the Foxm1 mutants, the BrdU−IdU+ G2 phase nuclei remained in the basal area in a mosaic pattern mixed with S phase nuclei. This result indicates that the synchronization of APs was disturbed (Fig. 4E–E′). To observe this asynchronization more precisely, progenitors were first labeled with IdU for 4 h and colabeled with BrdU for another 1 h (Fig. 4H). Consistent with the previous experiments, the control BrdU+IdU+ S phase nuclei remained in the basal half of the VZ after 4 h, whereas most of the BrdU−IdU+ G2 phase nuclei had arrived at the apical surface; thus, nuclei in the S and G2 phases were clearly separated. In the Foxm1 mutants, a similar mosaic distribution of S and G2 phase nuclei was observed (Fig. 4I–I′). Moreover, the first group of IdU-labeled nuclei that entered G2 phase and arrived at the apical surface exhibited a mottled shape; these are referred to as “forefront” nuclei (Fig. 4E,I). In our model, double labeling of PH3- and BrdU-labeled forefront nuclei was also observed as early as the 1.5 h BrdU labeling (Fig. 4J), whereas in the Foxm1 mutants, double labeling was not detected until the 5 h BrdU labeling (Fig. 4K,M,O), indicating an abnormally slow G2 progression. Together, these results suggested that G2 phase might also be affected in the Foxm1 mutants, causing the observed defects in AP synchronization during basal-to-apical INM.\n\nFoxm1 is important for maintaining the balance between AP self-renewal and the transition to BPs\n\nThe progenitor cell decision to undergo self-renewal or differentiation is one of the key programs in neurogenesis (Calegari et al., 2005; Dehay and Kennedy, 2007; Fietz and Huttner, 2011), and both INM and the cell cycle are involved in this process. During cortical neurogenesis, APs generate BPs, also called intermediate progenitors (Götz and Huttner, 2005), through asymmetric cell division (Zhong and Chia, 2008; Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012). Our results have shown that Foxm1 regulates the cell cycle, INM, and AP synchronization. Therefore, we investigated whether the impairments in the cell cycle and INM affect the BPs. As shown by immunostaining for Tbr2, the deletion of Foxm1 resulted in an increase in the total number of BPs in the entire cortex (Fig. 5A–C), and the number of BPs in the VZ also increased (Fig. 5D–F). Tbr2+ BPs are normally generated through either BP self-renewal within the SVZ or the transition from APs in the VZ. Double immunostaining with BrdU (14 h injection) and Tbr2 showed that the percentage of Tbr2+ BrdU+ APs in the VZ, which corresponded to the APs that were poised to leave G1 phase and differentiate into BPs, was significantly increased in the mutants (Fig. 5G–K), indicating that the transition from APs to BPs was enhanced in the VZ. Interestingly, we also observed a twofold increase in the number of nonsurface mitotic PH3+ proliferating cells in the SVZ of the mutants (Fig. 5N). As expected, the number of Tbr2+PH3+ nonsurface mitotic BPs showed similar increase in Foxm1 cko (Fig. 5O). The increased number of Tbr2+ PH3+ cells may indicate that the BPs in the SVZ that were generated from Foxm1-deficient APs also exhibited a similarly slow cell cycle progression, and the prolonged cell cycle allowed more BPs to remain in the cell cycle before they migrated away from the SVZ (Fig. 5L,M). Our results indicate that Foxm1 is important for maintaining the balance between AP self-renewal and the transition to BPs; the disruption of Foxm1 promotes embryonic neurogenesis by generating more BPs.\n\nThe G2 phase regulators Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b are downregulated in the Foxm1 cko dorsal telencephalon\n\nTo identify possible molecular mechanisms in Foxm1 regulation of INM and the defects in cell cycle progression, we analyzed the mRNA levels of cell cycle regulators important for different cell-cycle phases, such as the S phase regulators Cyclin a and Cdk2, G2/M phase regulators Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b, and G1 phase regulators Cyclin d1 and Aurora a and b (Laoukili et al., 2007, 2008; Wierstra and Alves, 2007; Kalin et al., 2011). Interestingly, there was a 70% downregulation of the mRNA level of the G2/M-phase regulator Cyclin b1 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, another important regulator, Cdc25b, which usually binds to Cyclin b1, was similarly reduced in the mutants (Fig. 6A). This finding was further confirmed by in situ hybridization. In control animals, both Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b showed a specific apical-high/basal-low expression pattern in the VZ, consistent with the fact that the expression of these two factors begins at S phase, reaching their maximum levels in G2/M phase and function in G2/M phase (Fig. 6C–F). In the mutants, very weak signals were detected only at the basal germinal zone, with a loss of high expression levels at the apical surface (Fig. 6C′, D′, E′, F′). Our data suggest that Foxm1, together with its downstream factors Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b, is required for normal cell-cycle progression. Loss of Foxm1 downregulated the expression of Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b in apical half of VZ and might be why basal-to-apical INM and the length of the cell cycle were disturbed in the Foxm1 mutants.\n\nNotch–Delta signaling is not affected in the Foxm1 mutants\n\nPrevious studies have shown that cell fate determination in the neuroepithelium is controlled by lateral inhibition through the selective activation of Notch-Delta signaling. AP synchronization is favored by lateral inhibition, and groups of APs are synchronized at specific mitotic stages through INM (Murciano et al., 2002; Buchman and Tsai, 2008; Kageyama et al., 2009; Latasa et al., 2009; Willardsen and Link, 2011). We observed that both Notch1 and Delta-like 1 were expressed in normal apical-high and basal-low gradients in the control and Foxm1 cko mice. Moreover, no differences in the expression levels of their downstream targets Ngn2 and Hes5 were detected (Fig. 6B, G–J′). These results indicate that the increased transition from APs to BPs in the Foxm1 mutants does not involve Notch signaling and that Foxm1 acts cell-autonomously in INM and fate determination.\n\nDisruption of Foxm1 results in decreased anxiety-related behavior in adults\n\nOur results suggest a predominantly early embryonic role for Foxm1 in INM, the cell cycle and the AP to BP transition. To investigate whether abnormal early development affects adult cortical morphology, we performed immunostaining for NeuN, a transcription factor expressed in mature neurons. We found a slight but significant (13.3%) decrease in the number of NeuN+ neurons in mutant cortices (Fig. 7A–C); a similar defect was observed by Nissl staining (data not shown). Immunostaining for distinct cortical layer-specific markers (CDP, Satb2, Ctip2, and FoxP2) in P8 brains revealed similar decreases in the numbers of neurons in each layer (Fig. 7D–K). Furthermore, neurons generated at E12.5 (Fig. 7L,M) and E15.5 (Fig. 7N,O) were labeled by BrdU injection and observed at P8. As expected, we found a 22.6% decrease in the number of E15.5-labeled BrdU+ cells in the Foxm1 cko mice (Fig. 7P). We then tested cell death at E14.5 and P8 by immunostaining of cleaved-caspase 3 and found no significant difference between the controls and Foxm1 mutants, which excluded the possibility that the decrease in NeuN+ neurons resulted from cell death (data not shown). We next asked whether the disruption of Foxm1 had behavioral consequences. We tested adult mice for open field activity for over 15 min. Foxm1 mutants were more active than the control mice, as measured by total movement and velocity (Fig. 8A,B). The traces of the open field trajectory for each genotype showed that mutants were more likely than controls to enter the center zone (Fig. 8I). Furthermore, Foxm1 mutants tended to spend more time in the center than the controls, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 8C). Because anxiety plays an important role in thigmotaxis, which drives mice to move along the wall in the open-field test, and the behavior within the first 5 min of the test best reflects anxiety levels, we measured the duration in the center zone during the first 5 min. Foxm1 mutants spent 59.0% more time in the center zone compared with the controls (Fig. 8D,E). Identical results were observed for the distance to the center zone, which reflects movement away from the center zone (Fig. 8F–H). This result raised the possibility that Foxm1 mutants have defects in anxiety behavior. The elevated O-maze test was performed to further elucidate the role of Foxm1 in anxiety-related behavior. Significant differences in anxiety levels were detected between the mutant and control mice; the frequency of entering and time spent in the open arms was significantly greater for the mutants than for the controls (Fig. 8J,K), supporting the hypothesis that Foxm1 mutants are less anxious. Because Foxm1 was also ablated in the hippocampus in our Foxm1fl/fl; Emx1-Cre model, we examined the morphogenesis of the hippocampus and found no differences between the controls and the Foxm1 mutants (data not shown). We also tested hippocampus-related contextual and cued fear conditioning behaviors. Foxm1 mutants performed similarly to the controls (Fig. 8L,M). Thus, the loss of Foxm1 has no effects on fear memory but leads to reduced anxiety-related behavior.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we describe new roles for Foxm1 in controlling INM and cell-cycle progression. The inactivation of Foxm1 leads to impaired INM due to a prolonged cell cycle. Impaired INM disturbs AP synchronization and further enhances the transition from APs to BPs. Our study demonstrates that Foxm1 is important for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation by controlling INM and revealed a link between INM and the cell-cycle regulator Foxm1. More importantly, Foxm1 ablation resulted in reduced anxiety-related behavior.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the cell cycle is required for INM (Huttner and Kosodo, 2005; Schenk et al., 2009; Kosodo et al., 2011; Reiner et al., 2012). The nuclei of progenitors arrested in S phase are distributed basally in the VZ rather than moving toward the apical side, whereas nuclei arrested in G2/M phase stop migrating toward the basal side and accumulate apically (Murciano et al., 2002; Del Bene, 2011). The inhibition of G1 phase results in a basal accumulation of APs (Ueno et al., 2006). Interestingly, the converse is not true; INM is not required for cell-cycle progression. Myosin II disruption prevents apical-to-basal migration in G1 phase but has no effects on cell cycle length. In our present study, the disruption of the cell cycle regulator Foxm1 in the dorsal telencephalon delayed INM. Further analysis of cell-cycle parameters by BrdU/Ki67 and BrdU/IdU double labeling and cumulative BrdU labeling demonstrated that both S phase and the entire cell cycle were longer in the Foxm1 mutants. Moreover, 1.5/2 h, 1/5 h BrdU/IdU, and BrdU/PH3 double labeling suggested that G2 phase may also be extended in the Foxm1 mutants. Our study has established a link between INM and the cell cycle regulator Foxm1.\n\nFoxm1 is upregulated at the onset of tumorigenesis (Raychaudhuri and Park, 2011; Koo et al., 2012), consistent with its role in controlling cell cycle progression, including mitotic entry, spindle formation, centrosome replication and the G2/M checkpoint (Laoukili et al., 2007). By controlling the expression of CDKs at the checkpoints (Kalin et al., 2011), Foxm1 regulates the G1/S and G2/M transitions. The loss of Foxm1 leads to defects in spindle segregation and, consequently, polyploidy in hepatocytes and myocardial cells (Krupczak-Hollis et al., 2004; Ramakrishna et al., 2007). However, polyploidy was not observed in neuronal progenitors in the developing telencephalon of the Foxm1 mutants. Interestingly, we found that the mRNA levels of Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b, downstream targets of Foxm1, were dramatically decreased in the Foxm1 mutants. In situ hybridization revealed an apical half-specific decrease in Cyclin B1 and Cdc25b, which suggest that the proper expression of the Cyclin b1 and Cdc25b complex may be important for INM.\n\nA key aspect of mammalian cortical neurogenesis is cell fate determination, accompanied by the balance between self-renewal and differentiation (Bertrand et al., 2002; Miyata et al., 2004; Calegari et al., 2005; Dehay and Kennedy, 2007). INM functions to synchronize APs and to organize APs into groups, ensuring that lateral inhibition occurs in the apical region of the VZ (Ueno et al., 2006; Kageyama et al., 2009; Taverna and Huttner, 2010). In the present study, we observed increased numbers of Tbr2+ BrdU+ progenitors in the VZ, which suggested that defects in INM and the cell cycle promote the transition from APs to BPs in the VZ and enhance neurogenesis. Furthermore, the deletion of Foxm1 not only impairs INM but also disturbs AP synchronization. APs expressing neurogenic genes are dispersed, which may cause lateral inhibition throughout the whole VZ and result in increased neurogenesis (Götz and Huttner, 2005; Molnár et al., 2011). However, we did not detect any change in the expression of the proneural gene Ngn2. These data indicate that the abnormal transition from APs to BPs in Foxm1 mutants was not caused by changes in Ngn2 or Notch/Delta signaling. Interestingly, the increased number of Tbr2+ PH3+ cells in the SVZ may reflect that the BPs in the SVZ also exhibited a slower cell-cycle progression, similar to the Foxm1 deficient APs. Further studies are required to reveal the precise underlying mechanism. Together, our data suggest that Foxm1 is required to maintain the balance of AP self-renewal and differentiation. Disrupting Foxm1 disturbs INM and the synchronization of APs and promotes the transition from APs to BPs.\n\nThe Foxm1 mutants exhibited a slightly decreased number of mature neurons, and more interestingly, a relatively high level of activity, as well as reduced anxiety-related behaviors. Although Foxm1 mutants exhibit no severe cortical abnormalities, it remains unknown whether synapse number, electrophysiological characteristics, or subtle features, such as axon or dendrite positioning, are affected. The prefrontal and cingulate cortices and the amygdala play important roles in processing anxiety-related behavior (Hall et al., 2001; Viosca et al., 2009), and these three regions contain excitatory neurons originating from Emx1-positive progenitors, in which Foxm1 is normally expressed. It is possible that subtle structures in these regions are altered. Together, our data reveal a new role for Foxm1 in anxiety-related behavior. Further studies are needed to reveal the detailed mechanism."
