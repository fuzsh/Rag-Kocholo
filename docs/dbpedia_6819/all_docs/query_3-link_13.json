        "text": "A-level results for students in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales are out tomorrow! The Royal Agricultural University has been growing futures since 1845 and is ready to help those still looking for a place to commence their studies this September. We offer courses in Agriculture, Business, Environment, Equine, and Land and Property. For more information visit our dedicated Clearing page: https://lnkd.in/ea8bax-F #GrowYourFuture #OurRAU\n\nBBC Radio 4 - Farming Today will be focusing on rural skills all this week. To kick off the week, they spoke to our Associate Director of Commercial Services Ryan Hanson. Ryan and Caz Graham talked about rural skills and the rural economy and what part the RAU has to play in this as it explores and reviews its portfolio for both traditional and contemporary needs. Listen here: https://bbc.in/3M44KCk\n\nOur MBA in Food and Agriculture course prepares you to address global challenges and to successfully navigate through a time of uncertainty and change in the food and agriculture sector. Professor of Production Animal Health and Welfare, David Main, gives an overview of the course below. To find out more and to apply, please follow the link: https://bit.ly/4cmIJcs\n\nThe RAU’s student recruitment team is encouraging any students who don’t get the results they had been hoping for not to panic but to take time they need to think, and chat, through all their options. Ellie Gillingham, acting Head of Student Recruitment at the RAU, said: “We know that this time of year is a nerve-racking time for both A-level and Highers students with everyone hoping they get the grades they need to take that next step. “But if you don’t get the grades you were hoping for – or even if you do better than you expected and want to change your mind – please do just give us a call. Our Clearing programme is open to everyone!” As well as an extensive list of undergraduate degree programmes, the RAU also offers two-year Foundation degree courses which are designed to be practical with an emphasis on ‘hands-on’ experience.

He graduated from the Royal Agricultural University with a degree in agricultural management in 2013, having grown up on a family farm near Alnwick. Before this, of course, he was also awaiting his results, just like many prospective students across the country during this period.
