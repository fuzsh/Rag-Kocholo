        "text": "Indigenous Peoples have been emphatic: the climate crisis will not be solved by the same paradigm that caused it. Their advocacy, coupled with a growing acknowledgement of Indigenous knowledge systems&#39; contributions to climate action and transformative change, has drawn international attention, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Nevertheless, many barriers to effective, rights-based recognition remain, reinforcing Indigenous Peoples&#39; marginalisation in climate science and politics. Based on a collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars, this article assesses how the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) recognises and promotes the role of Indigenous Peoples and their knowledge systems in climate governance. Through a content analysis of the Working Groups I, II and III Reports, we found a growing number of references to Indigenous Peoples and their knowledge systems. Despite this growth, we also found that the IPCC continues to...\n\nIndigenous Peoples' advocacy and contributions to climate action have drawn international attention, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This article assesses to which degree the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) recognises the role and knowledge systems of Indigenous Peoples. Through a content analysis of the Working Groups I, II, and III reports and the Synthesis Report, we found an increasing number of references related to Indigenous Peoples and their knowledge systems. However, the IPCC still perpetuates a reductionist approach that reinforces harmful stereotypes. Overcoming this weakness requires greater reflexivity and concrete actions, including consistent recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights, refraining from merely portraying Indigenous Peoples as vulnerable and adopting a strengths-based approach, ensuring ethical and equitable application of Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems, and involving Indigenous Peoples from the scoping process. By implementing these measures, the IPCC can improve its partnership with Indigenous Peoples in preparation for AR7.\n\nThe effects of climate change can prove to be catastrophic to the environment as a whole as well as the very people living on it. In fact, the two are closely related. As the environment suffers, so do the people. Melting ice caps and changes in global temperatures lead to the submergence of territories and destruction of sea life as well as heat waves/ice ages and arrival of invasive species, respectively. Though the effects of climate change extend to all, indigenous people are disproportionately affected. Climate change terrorizes their lands and living capabilities, as the relocation of indigenous people can prove to be detrimental; their lifestyles are heavily catered towards the geographical location they reside in. This paper examines the previous and current legislation put in place pertaining to climate justice for indigenous people and analyzed whether or not they have been effective thus far. We looked at the social, economic, and physical impacts that the legislations ha..."
