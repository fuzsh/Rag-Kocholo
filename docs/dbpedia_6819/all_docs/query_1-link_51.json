        "text": "#winhkflight üìçThe Pearl Island, Doha 7256 Qatar Pearl island is of the stop for the 4 hour Discover Doha tour by Hamad International Airport. Our flight was delayed this we took the opportunity to join the tour and it was amazing! Seeing Doha at night hits different, it was a chilly breezy trip and was much quiet down. The Pearl island is a luxurious man made island renowned for its luxurious stores, resorts, marina and shopping! It is a charming district inspired by the Venetian, but we did not manage to spot the sight of Venetian charm buildings, canals. We were there at night and all of the stores were closed but we managed to catch the sigh of Rolls Royce and Ferrari stores which were amazing ! Love the displays of the cars! I wish to travel to Hong Kong for the food!"
