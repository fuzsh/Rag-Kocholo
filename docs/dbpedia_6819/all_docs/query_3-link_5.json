        "text": "Navigating the Retraction Minefield in China and Beyond: A Need for Systemic Changes and Increased Focus on Researcher Well-Being - The Scholarly Kitchen The nationwide audit of retracted articles in China underscores the interconnectedness of stakeholders within the research ecosystem and emphasizes the importance of aligning incentives and priorities to foster a culture of integrity and accountability. Can similar efforts be applied globally to cultivate a culture of accountability and transparency? https://lnkd.in/gugAJDSm\n\nNavigating the Retraction Minefield in China and Beyond: A Need for Systemic Changes and Increased Focus on Researcher Well-Being - The Scholarly Kitchen The nationwide audit of retracted articles in China underscores the interconnectedness of stakeholders within the research ecosystem and emphasizes the importance of aligning incentives and priorities to foster a culture of integrity and accountability. Can similar efforts be applied globally to cultivate a culture of accountability and transparency? https://lnkd.in/gJxshp4T\n\nInteresting article. The abstract is a must-read. It is, indeed, \"not easy to promote integrity in hyper-competitive academic environments that value high levels of ambition\". \"Codes and guidance promoting integrity are, however, likely to influence those for whom such values are not optional, while others simply find ways around them\". The author concludes that the replication crisis requires robust â€˜top downâ€™ measures. https://lnkd.in/eUQMn_96\n\nTake a look at this story celebrating the ARTSCI 1C06 capstone experience, akin to the EE in some ways for my IB people, where our class had the opportunity to explore sociopolitical challenges through the lens of the course. As you'll read below, it was an impactful experience for our class and a way to engage with the world's questions. Check out my thoughts below https://lnkd.in/gHHdz9Xq and some of my peer's experiences here https://lnkd.in/gcgXBkAz\n\nðŸ“£ Call For Papers . . . . The Journal of Liberty and International Affairs (https://lnkd.in/dAXY6JHr) is delighted to announce its call for submissions for the 2024 issue! The journal strives to offer a dynamic international platform for analysis, research, and debate, primarily in the fields of political science, international relations, and law. Additionally, contributions from economics and related fields are also encouraged. The journal embraces multi- and interdisciplinary scholarship and comparative approaches. The journal is indexed in #EBSCO, #DOAJ/#DOAJSeal, #Crossref, #CEEOL, #SSOAR, #ERIHPLUS, #HeinOnline, #CIAO, #ProQuest, #ANVUR (#ClassA), #WorldCat, #Dimensions, etc. In response to the evolving academic publishing landscape, JLIA has adopted a rolling submission and publication model. You can submit your article at any time, with deadlines for publication rounds as follows: ðŸ“… Submission Round 1: 10 January ðŸ“… Submission Round 2: 10 April ðŸ“… Submission Round 3: 10 September Please note: Articles submitted after the final deadline for a volume will be considered for the following yearâ€™s publication. Early submission accelerates the peer review process and potential publication. The scope of the submitted text should not exceed more than 8000 words. You can register and submit online or email your submissions to contact@e-jlia.com #CallForPapers #PoliticalScience #InternationalRelations #Law #Economics #ScholarlyResearch #AcademicPublishing #jlia\n\nWhile the nation wide audit of retracted papers in China may be perceived as a response to a research integrity crisis, it presents a unique opportunity for meaningful reform and for cultivating a research culture defined by transparency and accountability, not just in China, but even globally. What do we need to do to cultivate a culture of accountability and transparency and to re-build trust in the integrity of research? Read more about this in The Scholarly Kitchen."
