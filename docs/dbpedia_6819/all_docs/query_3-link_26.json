With the rapid development of Qatar's economy and tourism, it has gradually formed its current size. The Old Towns Vachev Market is very lively in the evening. Compared to the modern urban atmosphere that is expanding during the day, Wach's evening seems to be more fascinating. The neon-lit streets, the glamorous harbour piers, and the mysterious mosques are all so lively and mysterious. The countless shops sell a variety of daily necessities, spices and fruits. When you walk into this market, you must be careful not to get lost, because the shops are criss-crossed like a labyrinth. Its fun to stroll through these stores. Learn to sit down in the street teahouse like a local, come to a pot of hookah, watch people come and go, feel the most pleasant slow life in the desert."
