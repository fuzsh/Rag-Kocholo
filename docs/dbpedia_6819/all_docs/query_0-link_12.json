        "text": "LinkedIn been great for me for networking- most of the best connections and collaborators have been inbound from multiple touch points (commenting on each other's posts, etc.). Also consider topic-specific discord/slack groups. In Climate Tech, there are a bunch of high-signal slack groups where people have found co-founders, investors, new collaborators, etc. https://www.climatetechlist.com/blog/new-to-climate-tech#virtual-communities\n\nSome free resources to understand your value and benefits, especially in tech company markets: - https://candor.co/offers - Levels.fyi and Perks.fyi - https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/ - https://h1bdata.info — uses public data that companies have to file with the US Department of Labor. Only includes salary though so not as accurate if your position is equity-heavy. In addition, ask your former co-workers - you might be surprised who is willing to share numbers if it's in the name of helping you find a better job\n\nCommute is often an underlooked benefit/intangible in choosing a job. One study in England found that 20 more minutes of commuting per day has the same negative effect on job satisfaction as a 19% pay cut. Consider negotiating some combination of: 1. more days remote if workspace is hybrid 2. going into a closer office (if the company has multiple offices in an area) 3. using commute as a factor to weigh job offer options 4. relocation benefits to help lessen commute\n\nBefore you network too much, consider the type of role you're interviewing for. For many technical roles (especially earlier career roles where the skills are undifferentiated), your ability to pass the technical screening interview matters far more than whatever inroads at a company (besides getting a referral to pass the resume check) When I received my 18 FAANG+ software engineer job offers a few years ago, my ability to pass technical interviews was by far the best-determining factor in my success, not my ability to connect with industry experts.\n\nThere are so many low/no-code tools out there that you don't need to always write code (even you're able to). Only write code if necessary- consider what the core value prop you're offering is and weigh whether that value prop is based actually writing code or not, or using an existing low-code/no-code tool is good enough.\n\nBy definition of a layoff, you were not the only one laid off from your company. Reach out to those who were also laid off and see if you can help each other in your job search For me, when I was laid off from Airtable, in addition to joining the Airtable alumni Slack group, I organized a WhatsApp group of recently laid-off Airtable software engineers, which was very helpful for each of us as we sought to understand visa issues, interview prepping, referrals, etc. I have a list of a few dozen tech company alumni groups here: https://www.warntracker.com/blog/company-alumni-communities"
