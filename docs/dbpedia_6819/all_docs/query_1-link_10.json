PfPMT catalyzes the triple methylation of phosphoethanolamine to produce phosphocholine, which is then used for phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Here we describe the 2.0 {angstrom} resolution X-ray crystal structure of PfPMT in complex with amodiaquine. To better characterize inhibition of PfPMT by amodiaquine, we determined the IC{sub 50} values of a series of aminoquinolines using a direct radiochemical assay. Both structural and functional analyses provide a possible approach for the development of new small molecule inhibitors of PfPMT.\n\nPhosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of P. knowlesi and P. falciparum malaria.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrause, Robert G E; Goldring, J P Dean\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPlasmodium knowlesi is recognised as the main cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia. The disease is often misdiagnosed as P. falciparum or P. malariae infections by microscopy, and the disease is difficult to eliminate due to its presence in both humans and monkeys. P. knowlesi infections can rapidly cause severe disease and require prompt diagnosis and treatment. No protein biomarker exists for the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of P. knowlesi infections. Plasmodium knowlesi infections can be diagnosed by PCR. Phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) is involved in malaria lipid biosynthesis and is not found in the human host. The P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi PMT proteins were recombinantly expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli host cells, affinity purified and used to raise antibodies in chickens. Antibodies against each recombinant PMT protein all detected all three recombinant proteins and the native 29 kDa P. falciparum PMT protein on western blots and in ELISA. Antibodies against a PMT epitope (PLENNQYTDEGVKC) common to all three PMT orthologues detected all three proteins. Antibodies against unique peptides from each orthologue of PMT, PfCEVEHKYLHENKE, PvVYSIKEYNSLKDC, PkLYPTDEYNSLKDC detected only the parent protein in western blots and P. falciparum infected red blood cell lysates or blood lysates spiked with the respective proteins. Similar concentrations of PfPMT and the control, PfLDH, were detected in the same parasite lysate. The recombinant PfPMT protein was detected by a human anti-malaria antibody pool. PMT, like the pan-specific LDH biomarker used in RDT tests, is both soluble, present at comparable concentrations in the parasite and constitutes a promising antimalarial drug target. PMT is absent from the human proteome. PMT has the potential as a biomarker for human malaria and in particular as the first P. knowlesi specific protein with diagnostic potential for the identification of a P. knowlesi infection.\n\nAn alternative mechanism for the methylation of phosphoethanolamine catalyzed by Plasmodium falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSaen-oon, Suwipa; Lee, Soon Goo; Jez, Joseph M.; ...\n\n2014-10-06\n\nHere, the phosphobase methylation pathway catalyzed by the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase in Plasmodium falciparum (PfPMT), the malaria parasite, offers an attractive target for anti-parasitic drug development.

Quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations tested the proposed reaction mechanism for methylation of pEA involving the previously identified Tyr-19âHis-132 dyad, which indicated an energetically unfavorable mechanism.

X-ray crystal structures of the PfPMT-D128A mutant in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine and either pEA or phosphocholine reveal how mutation of Asp-128 disrupts a hydrogen bond network in the active site.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main parasite antigens employed by various commercial RDTs. It has been hypothesized that the poor detection of LDH-based RDTs is attributed in part to the sequence diversity of the gene. To test this, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of the P. falciparum ldh gene in Thailand and to construct the map of LDH sequence diversity in P. falciparum populations worldwide. The ldh gene was sequenced for 50 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand and compared with hundreds of sequences from P. falciparum populations worldwide. Several indices of molecular variation were calculated, including the proportion of polymorphic sites, the average nucleotide diversity index (Ï), and the haplotype diversity index (H). Tests of positive selection and neutrality tests were performed to determine signatures of natural selection on the gene. Mean genetic distance within and between species of Plasmodium ldh was analysed to infer evolutionary relationships. Nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum ldh could be classified into 9 alleles, encoding 5 isoforms of LDH. L1a was the most common allelic type and was distributed in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum ldh sequences were highly conserved, with haplotype and nucleotide diversity values of 0.203 and 0.0004, respectively. The extremely low genetic diversity was maintained by purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. Phylogenetic analysis inferred the close genetic relationship of P. falciparum to malaria parasites of great apes, rather than to other human malaria parasites. This study revealed the global genetic variation of the ldh gene in P. falciparum, providing knowledge for improving detection of LDH-based RDTs and supporting the candidacy of\n\nAmplification of a Gene Related to Mammalian mdr Genes in Drug-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilson, Craig M.; Serrano, Adelfa E.; Wasley, Annemarie; Bogenschutz, Michael P.; Shankar, Anuraj H.; Wirth, Dyann F.\n\n1989-06-01\n\nThe malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains at least two genes related to the mammalian multiple drug resistance genes, and at least one of the P. falciparum genes is expressed at a higher level and is present in higher copy number in a strain that is resistant to multiple drugs than in a strain that is sensitive to the drugs.\n\nMefloquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and increased pfmdr1 gene copy number.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrice, Ric N; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Brockman, Alan; McGready, Rose; Ashley, Elizabeth; Phaipun, Lucy; Patel, Rina; Laing, Kenneth; Looareesuwan, Sornchai; White, Nicholas J; Nosten, FranÃ§ois; Krishna, Sanjeev\n\nThe borders of Thailand harbour the world's most multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites.

A combination of artesunate with mefloquine now cures more than 95% of acute infections. For both treatment regimens, the underlying mechanisms of resistance are not known. The relation between polymorphisms in the P falciparum multidrug resistant gene 1 (pfmdr1) and the in-vitro and in-vivo responses to mefloquine were assessed in 618 samples from patients with falciparum malaria studied prospectively over 12 years. pfmdr1 copy number was assessed by a robust real-time PCR assay. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of pfmdr1, P falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) and P falciparum Ca2+ ATPase gene (pfATP6) were assessed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Increased copy number of pfmdr1 was the most important determinant of in-vitro and in-vivo resistance to mefloquine, and also to reduced artesunate sensitivity in vitro. In a Cox regression model with control for known confounders, increased pfmdr1 copy number was associated with an attributable hazard ratio (AHR) for treatment failure of 6.3 (95% CI 2.9-13.8, p<0.001) after mefloquine monotherapy and 5.4 (2.0-14.6, p=0.001) after artesunate-mefloquine therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfmdr1 were associated with increased mefloquine susceptibility in vitro, but not in vivo. Amplification in pfmdr1 is the main cause of resistance to mefloquine in falciparum malaria. Multidrug resistant P falciparum malaria is common in southeast Asia, but difficult to identify and treat. Genes that encode parasite transport proteins maybe involved in export of drugs and so cause resistance. In this study we show that increase in copy number of pfmdr1, a gene encoding a parasite transport protein, is the best overall predictor of treatment failure with\n\nP. falciparum Modulates Erythroblast Cell Gene Expression in Signaling and Erythrocyte Production Pathways\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTamez, Pamela A.; Liu, Hui; Wickrema, Amittha; Haldar, Kasturi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nGlobal, genomic responses of erythrocytes to infectious agents have been difficult to measure because these cells are e-nucleated. We have previously demonstrated that in vitro matured, nucleated erythroblast cells at the orthochromatic stage can be efficiently infected by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We now show that infection of orthochromatic cells induces change in 609 host genes. 592 of these transcripts are up-regulated and associated with metabolic and chaperone pathways unique to P. falciparum infection, as well as a wide range of signaling pathways that are also induced in related apicomplexan infections of mouse hepatocytes or human fibroblast cells. Our data additionally show that polychromatophilic cells, which precede the orthochromatic stage and are not infected when co-cultured with P. falciparum, up-regulate a small set of genes, at least two of which are associated with pathways of hematopoiesis and/or erythroid cell development. These data support the idea that P. falciparum affects erythropoiesis at multiple stages during erythroblast differentiation. Further P. falciparum may modulate gene expression in bystander erythroblasts and thus influence pathways of erythrocyte development. This study provides a benchmark of the host erythroblast cell response to infection by P. falciparum.

MMV019918 (1, 1-[5-(4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl)furan-2-yl]-N-[(piperidin-4-yl)methyl]methanamine) was selected from the MMV Malaria Box for its dual activity against both asexual stages and gametocytes. In-depth structure-activity relationship studies and cytotoxicity evaluation led to the selection of 25 for further biological investigation. The potential transmission blocking activity of 25 versus P.Â falciparum was confirmed through the standard membrane-feeding assay. Both 1 and 25 significantly prolonged atrioventricular conduction time in Langendorff-isolated rat hearts, and showed inhibitory activity of Ba 2+ current through Ca v 1.2 channels. An in silico target-fishing study suggested the enzyme phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (PfPMT) as a potential target. However, compound activity against PfPMT did not track with the antiplasmodial activity, suggesting the latter activity relies on a different molecular target. Nevertheless, 25 showed interesting activity against PfPMT, which could be an important starting point for the identification of more potent inhibitors active against both sexual and asexual stages of the parasite.

Here, to enable reliable control of target gene expression, we build a system to efficiently modulate translation. We overcame several problems associated with other approaches for regulating gene expression in P. falciparum. Specifically, our system functions predictably across several native and engineered promoter contexts, and affords control over reporter and native parasite proteins irrespective of their subcellular compartmentalization. Induction and repression of gene expression are rapid, homogeneous, and stable over prolonged periods. To demonstrate practical application of our system, we used it to reveal direct links between antimalarial drugs and their native parasite molecular target. This is an important out come given the rapid spread of resistance, and intensified efforts to efficiently discover and optimize new antimalarial drugs. Overall, the studies presented highlight the utility of our system for broadly controlling gene expression and performing functional genetics in P. falciparum.

The nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the quantitative real-time PCR methodologies were used to determine the alleles of the Pfmdr1 and PfATPase6 genes and the Pfmdr1 copy number variation, respectively, in patients samples collected prior to treatment and at the reoccurrence of parasites during a 42-day follow-up. The Pfmdr1 haplotype 86N-184F-1246D was significantly associated (P < 0.00001) with treatment failures and was selected for among posttreatment samples obtained from patients with newly acquired or recrudescing infections (P < 0.00001; chi(2) = 36.5) and in gametocytes (log rank statistic = 5; P = 0.0253) after treatment with AL. All pre- and posttreatment samples as well as gametocytes harbored a single copy of the Pfmdr1 gene and the wild-type allele (L89) at codon 89 of the PfATPase6 gene. These findings suggest that polymorphisms in the Pfmdr1 gene are under AL selection pressure. Pfmdr1 polymorphisms may result in reduction in the therapeutic efficacy of this newly adopted combination treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Saharan countries of Africa.\n\nDevelopment of loop-mediated isothermal amplification with Plasmodium falciparum unique genes for molecular diagnosis of human malaria.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yijing; Yao, Yi; Du, Weixing; Wu, Kai; Xu, Wenyue; Lin, Min; Tan, Huabing; Li, Jian\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIn order to achieve better outcomes for treatment and in the prophylaxis of malaria, it is imperative to develop a sensitive, specific, and accurate assay for early diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection, which is the major cause of malaria. In this study, we aimed to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay with P. falciparum unique genes for sensitive, specific, and accurate detection of P. falciparum infection. The unique genes of P. falciparum were randomly selected from PlasmoDB. The LAMP primers of the unique genes were designed using PrimerExplorer V4. LAMP assays with primers from unique genes of P. falciparum and conserved 18S rRNA gene were developed and their sensitivity was assessed. The specificity of the most sensitive LAMP assay was further examined using genomic DNA from Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium yoelii and Toxoplasma gondii. Finally, the unique gene-based LAMP assay was validated using clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. A total of 31 sets of top-scored LAMP primers from nine unique genes were selected from the pools of designed primers. The LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was the most sensitive with the detection limit 5 parasites/Î¼l, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the genomic DNA samples of P. vivax, P. yoelii, and T. gondii. The LAMP assay with PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) was less sensitive with the detection limit 50 parasites/Î¼l, and it displayed negative LAMP assay with the genomic DNA samples of P. yoelii and T. gondii, but displayed positive LAMP detection with P. vivax. The positive detection rate of the LAMP assay with PF3D7_1253300-5 was 90% (27/30), higher than that (80%, 24/30) of the positive rate of PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) in examining clinical samples of P. falciparum infection cases. The LAMP assay with the primer set PF3D7_1253300-5 was more sensitive, specific, and accurate than those with PF3D7_0112300 (18S rRNA) in examining P. falciparum infection, and therefore it is a\n\nSelection of Plasmodium falciparum Multidrug Resistance Gene 1 Alleles in Asexual Stages and Gametocytes by Artemether-Lumefantrine in Nigerian Children with Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria â¿\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHappi, C.

One promising candidate is the merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP-3) of Plasmodium falciparum. This antigenic protein, encoded by the merozoite surface protein (msp-3) gene, is polymorphic and classified according to size into the two allelic types of K1 and 3D7. A recent study revealed that both the K1 and 3D7 alleles co-circulated within P. falciparum populations in Thailand, but the extent of the sequence diversity and variation within each allelic type remains largely unknown. The msp-3 gene was sequenced from 59 P. falciparum samples collected from five endemic areas (Mae Hong Son, Kanchanaburi, Ranong, Trat and Ubon Ratchathani) in Thailand and analysed for nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity. The gene was also subject to population genetic analysis (F st ) and neutrality tests (Tajima's D, Fu and Li D* and Fu and Li' F* tests) to determine any signature of selection. The sequence analyses revealed eight unique DNA haplotypes and seven amino acid sequence variants, with a haplotype and nucleotide diversity of 0.828 and 0.049, respectively. Neutrality tests indicated that the polymorphism detected in the alanine heptad repeat region of MSP-3 was maintained by positive diversifying selection, suggesting its role as a potential target of protective immune responses and supporting its role as a vaccine candidate. Comparison of MSP-3 variants among parasite populations in Thailand, India and Nigeria also inferred a close genetic relationship between P. falciparum populations in Asia. This study revealed the extent of the msp-3 gene diversity in P. falciparum in Thailand, providing the fundamental basis for the better design of future blood stage malaria vaccines against P. falciparum.\n\nCase Report: A Case of Plasmodium falciparum hrp2 and hrp3 Gene Mutation in Bangladesh.\n\nPubMed\n\nNima, Maisha Khair; Hougard, Thomas; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Kibria, Mohammad Golam; Mohon, Abu Naser; Johora, Fatema Tuj; Rahman, Rajibur; Haque, Rashidul; Alam, Mohammad Shafiul\n\n2017-10-01\n\nSeveral species of Plasmodium are responsible for causing malaria in humans. Proper diagnoses are crucial to case management, because severity and treatment varies between species. Diagnoses can be made using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect Plasmodium proteins. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most virulent cases of malaria, and P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) is a common target of falciparum malaria RDTs. Here we report a case in which a falciparum malaria patient in Bangladesh tested negative on PfHRP2-based RDTs. The negative results can be attributed to a deletion of part of the pfhrp2 gene and frameshift mutations in both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene. This finding may have implications for malaria diagnostics and case management in Bangladesh and other regions of South Asia.\n\nAllelic Diversity and Geographical Distribution of the Gene Encoding Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Surface Protein-3 in Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nSawaswong, Vorthon; Simpalipan, Phumin; Siripoon, Napaporn; Harnyuttanakorn, Pongchai; Pattaradilokrat, Sittiporn\n\n2015-04-01\n\nMerozoite surface proteins (MSPs) of malaria parasites play critical roles during the erythrocyte invasion and so are potential candidates for malaria vaccine development. However, because MSPs are often under strong immune selection, they can exhibit extensive genetic diversity. The gene encoding the merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP-3) of Plasmodium falciparum displays 2 allelic types, K1 and 3D7. In Thailand, the allelic frequency of the P. falciparum msp-3 gene was evaluated in a single P. falciparum population in Tak at the Thailand and Myanmar border. However, no study has yet looked at the extent of genetic diversity of the msp-3 gene in P. falciparum populations in other localities. Here, we genotyped the msp-3 alleles of 63 P. falciparum samples collected from 5 geographical populations along the borders of Thailand with 3 neighboring countries (Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia). Our study indicated that the K1 and 3D7 alleles coexisted, but at different proportions in different Thai P. falciparum populations. K1 was more prevalent in populations at the Thailand-Myanmar and Thailand-Cambodia borders, whilst 3D7 was more prevalent at the Thailand-Laos border. Global analysis of the msp-3 allele frequencies revealed that proportions of K1 and 3D7 alleles of msp-3 also varied in different continents, suggesting the divergence of malaria parasite populations. In conclusion, the variation in the msp-3 allelic patterns of P. falciparum in Thailand provides fundamental knowledge for inferring the P. falciparum population structure and for the best design of msp-3 based malaria vaccines.\n\nDNA secondary structures are associated with recombination in major Plasmodium falciparum variable surface antigen gene families\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSander, Adam F.; Lavstsen, Thomas; Rask, Thomas S.; Lisby, Michael; Salanti, Ali; Fordyce, Sarah L.; Jespersen, Jakob S.; Carter, Richard; Deitsch, Kirk W.; Theander, Thor G.; Pedersen, Anders Gorm; Arnot, David E.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMany bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens undergo antigenic variation to counter host immune defense mechanisms. In Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal of human malaria parasites, switching of var gene expression results in alternating expression of the adhesion proteins of the Plasmodium falciparum-erythrocyte membrane protein 1 class on the infected erythrocyte surface. Recombination clearly generates var diversity, but the nature and control of the genetic exchanges involved remain unclear. By experimental and bioinformatic identification of recombination events and genome-wide recombination hotspots in var genes, we show that during the parasiteâs sexual stages, ectopic recombination between isogenous var paralogs occurs near low folding free energy DNA 50-mers and that these sequences are heavily concentrated at the boundaries of regions encoding individual Plasmodium falciparum-erythrocyte membrane protein 1 structural domains. The recombinogenic potential of these 50-mers is not parasite-specific because these sequences also induce recombination when transferred to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetic cross data suggest that DNA secondary structures (DSS) act as inducers of recombination during DNA replication in P. falciparum sexual stages, and that these DSS-regulated genetic exchanges generate functional and diverse P. falciparum adhesion antigens. DSS-induced recombination may represent a common mechanism for optimizing the evolvability of virulence gene families in pathogens.

Each strain appears to have one CS protein gene which hybridizes readily to the Brazilian strain probe. The 5' and 3' thirds of the genes are invariant in size in all 18 strains whereas the central third containing the 12 base pair tandem repeats varies in size over a range of about 100 base pairs. Several differences were found in the locations of Sau3A sites in the genes. The Sau3A sites are significant because each of the minority Asn-Val-Asp-Pro repeats in the cloned gene has a Sau3A site. DNA melting of hybrids revealed a high degree of homology between the sequences of the cloned gene and genes from an Asian strain and an African strain. A 14 base oligodeoxynucleotide with a sequence from the central repeat region hybridized to all strains tested. We conclude that the CS protein gene is highly conserved among strains of P. falciparum and that malaria vaccine development with the CS protein is unlikely to be complicated by strain variation.\n\nUnraveling Haplotype Diversity of the Apical Membrane Antigen-1 Gene in Plasmodium falciparum Populations in Thailand\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLumkul, Lalita; Sawaswong, Vorthon; Simpalipan, Phumin; Kaewthamasorn, Morakot; Harnyuttanakorn, Pongchai; Pattaradilokrat, Sittiporn\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDevelopment of an effective vaccine is critically needed for the prevention of malaria. One of the key antigens for malaria vaccines is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the surface protein for erythrocyte invasion of the parasite. The gene encoding AMA-1 has been sequenced from populations of P. falciparum worldwide, but the haplotype diversity of the gene in P. falciparum populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Thailand, remains to be characterized. In the present study, the AMA-1 gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from the genomic DNA of 65 P. falciparum isolates from 5 endemic areas in Thailand. The nearly full-length 1,848 nucleotide sequence of AMA-1 was subjected to molecular analyses, including nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity and neutrality tests. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise population differentiation (Fst indices) were performed to infer the population structure. The analyses identified 60 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, predominately located in domain I of AMA-1. A total of 31 unique AMA-1 haplotypes were identified, which included 11 novel ones. The phylogenetic tree of the AMA-1 haplotypes revealed multiple clades of AMA-1, each of which contained parasites of multiple geographical origins, consistent with the Fst indices indicating genetic homogeneity or gene flow among geographically distinct populations of P. falciparum in Thailandâs borders with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. In summary, the study revealed novel haplotypes and population structure needed for the further advancement of AMA-1-based malaria vaccines in the GMS.

Ross; Mazier, Dominique; Haldar, Kasturi\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum is comprised of morphologically distinct ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Each of these developmental stages possesses a distinct pattern of gene expression. Regulation of P. falciparum gene expression is thought to occur, at least in part, at the promoter level. Previously, we have found that although the RNA of the P. falciparum hrp3 gene is only seen in ring-stage parasites, deletion of a specific sequensce in the 5â end of the promoter region decreased ring-stage expression of hrp3 and enabled detection of its transcripts in trophozoite-stage parasites. In order to investigate this stage specific regulation of gene expression, we employed a series of nested deletions of the 1.7-kb hrp3 promoter. Firefly luciferase gene was used as a reporter to evaluate the role of promoter sequences in gene regulation. Using this approach, we identified a ring-stage specific regulatory region on the hrp3 promoter located between -1.7-kb and -1.1-kb from the ATG initiation codon. Small 100â150 bp truncations on this enhancer-like region failed to uncover discrete regulatory sequences, suggesting the multipartite nature of this element. The data presented in this study demonstrates that stage specific promoter activity of the hrp3 gene in P. falciparum blood stage parasites is supported, at least in-part, by a small promoter region that can function in the absence of a larger chromosomal context.

Moreover, the GLURP gene is also employed routinely as a genetic marker for malarial genotyping in epidemiological studies. While extensive size polymorphisms in GLURP are well recorded, the extent of the sequence diversity of this gene is rarely investigated. The present study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of GLURP in natural populations of P. falciparum. The polymorphic C-terminal repetitive R2 region of GLURP sequences from 65 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand were generated and combined with the data from 103 worldwide isolates to generate a GLURP database. The collection was comprised of 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique GLURP subtypes, characterized by 18 types of amino acid repeat units (AAU). Of these, 28 GLURP subtypes, formed by 10 AAU types, were detected in P. falciparum in Thailand. Among them, 19 GLURP subtypes and 2 AAU types are described for the first time in the Thai parasite population. The AAU sequences were highly conserved, which is likely due to negative selection. Standard Fst analysis revealed the shared distributions of GLURP types among the P. falciparum populations, providing evidence of gene flow among the different demographic populations. Sequence diversity causing size variations in GLURP in Thai P. falciparum populations were detected, and caused by non-synonymous substitutions in repeat units and some insertion/deletion of aspartic acid or glutamic acid codons between repeat units. The P. falciparum population structure based on GLURP showed promising implications for the development of GLURP-based vaccines and for monitoring vaccine efficacy.\n\nGenetic diversity of the msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes of Plasmodium falciparum isolates along the Thai-Myanmar borders.\n\nPubMed\n\nCongpuong, Kanungnit; Sukaram, Rungniran; Prompan, Yuparat; Dornae, Aibteesam\n\n2014-08-01\n\nTo study the genetic diversity at the msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolates from 3 endemic areas in Thailand: Tak, Kanchanaburi and Ranong provinces. A total of 144 P. falciparum isolates collected prior to treatment during January, 2012 to June, 2013 were genotyped. DNA was extracted; allele frequency and diversity of msp-1, msp-2, and glurp genes were investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction. P. falciparum isolates in this study had high rate of multiple genotypes infection (96.5%) with an overall mean multiplicity of infection of 3.21. The distribution of allelic families of msp-1 was significantly different among isolates from Tak, Kanchanaburi, and Ranong but not for the msp-2. K1 and MAD20 were the predominant allelic families at the msp-1 gene, whereas alleles belonging to 3D7 were more frequent at the msp-2 gene. The glurp gene had the least diverse alleles. Population structure of P. falciparum isolates from Tak and Ranong was quite similar as revealed by the presence of similar proportions of MAD20 and K1 alleles at msp-1 loci, 3D7 and FC27 alleles at msp-2 loci as well as comparable mean MOI. Isolates from Kanchanaburi had different structures; the most prevalent alleles were K1 and RO33. The present study shows that P. falciparum isolates from Tak and Ranong provinces had similar allelic pattern of msp-1 and msp-2 and diversity but different from Kanchanaburi isolates. These allelic variant profiles are valuable baseline data for future epidemiological study of malaria transmission and for continued monitoring of polymorphisms associated with antimalarial drug resistance in these areas.\n\nIn-depth comparative analysis of malaria parasite genomes reveals protein-coding genes linked to human disease in Plasmodium falciparum genome.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Xuewu; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liang, Jiao; Wang, Luojun; Qin, Na; Zhao, Ya; Zhao, Gang\n\n2018-05-02\n\nPlasmodium falciparum is the most virulent malaria parasite capable of parasitizing human erythrocytes. The identification of genes related to this capability can enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human malaria and lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for malaria control. With the availability of several malaria parasite genome sequences, performing computational analysis is now a practical strategy to identify genes contributing to this disease. Here, we developed and used a virtual genome method to assign 33,314 genes from three human malaria parasites, namely, P. falciparum, P. knowlesi and P. vivax, and three rodent malaria parasites, namely, P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii, to 4605 clusters. Each cluster consisted of genes whose protein sequences were significantly similar and was considered as a virtual gene. Comparing the enriched values of all clusters in human malaria parasites with those in rodent malaria parasites revealed 115 P. falciparum genes putatively responsible for parasitizing human erythrocytes. These genes are mainly located in the chromosome internal regions and participate in many biological processes, including membrane protein trafficking and thiamine biosynthesis. Meanwhile, 289 P. berghei genes were included in the rodent parasite-enriched clusters. Most are located in subtelomeric regions and encode erythrocyte surface proteins. Comparing cluster values in P. falciparum with those in P. vivax and P. knowlesi revealed 493 candidate genes linked to virulence. Some of them encode proteins present on the erythrocyte surface and participate in cytoadhesion, virulence factor trafficking, or erythrocyte invasion, but many genes with unknown function were also identified. Cerebral malaria is characterized by accumulation of infected erythrocytes at trophozoite stage in brain microvascular. To discover cerebral malaria-related genes, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was introduced to extract\n\nMutations in Plasmodium falciparum K13 propeller gene from Bangladesh (2009-2013).\n\nPubMed\n\nMohon, Abu Naser; Alam, Mohammad Shafiul; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Folefoc, Asongna; Shahinas, Dea; Haque, Rashidul; Pillai, Dylan R\n\n2014-11-18\n\nBangladesh is a malaria hypo-endemic country sharing borders with India and Myanmar. Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) remains successful in Bangladesh. An increase of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites on the Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders is worrisome. K13 propeller gene (PF3D7_1343700 or PF13_0238) mutations have been linked to both in vitro artemisinin resistance and in vivo slow parasite clearance rates. This group undertook to evaluate if mutations seen in Cambodia have emerged in Bangladesh where ACT use is now standard for a decade. Samples were obtained from Plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria patients from Upazila health complexes (UHC) between 2009 and 2013 in seven endemic districts of Bangladesh. These districts included Khagrachari (Matiranga UHC), Rangamati (Rajasthali UHC), Cox's Bazar (Ramu and Ukhia UHC), Bandarban (Lama UHC), Mymensingh (Haluaghat UHC), Netrokona (Durgapur and Kalmakanda UHC), and Moulvibazar (Sreemangal and Kamalganj UHC). Out of 296 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples, 271 (91.6%) were confirmed as mono-infections by both real-time PCR and nested PCR. The K13 propeller gene from 253 (93.4%) samples was sequenced bi-directionally. One non-synonymous mutation (A578S) was found in Bangladeshi clinical isolates. The A578S mutation was confirmed and lies adjacent to the C580Y mutation, the major mutation causing delayed parasite clearance in Cambodia. Based on computational modeling A578S should have a significant effect on tertiary structure of the protein. The data suggest that P. falciparum in Bangladesh remains free of the C580Y mutation linked to delayed parasite clearance. However, the mutation A578S is present and based on structural analysis could affect K13 gene function. Further in vivo clinical studies are required to validate the effect of this mutation.\n\nHeterologous expression of proteins from Plasmodium falciparum: results from 1000 genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehlin, Christopher; Boni, Erica; Buckner, Frederick S; Engel, Linnea; Feist, Tiffany; Gelb, Michael H; Haji, Lutfiyah; Kim, David; Liu, Colleen; Mueller, Natascha; Myler, Peter J; Reddy, J T; Sampson, Joshua N; Subramanian, E; Van Voorhis, Wesley C; Worthey, Elizabeth; Zucker, Frank; Hol, Wim G J\n\n2006-08-01\n\nAs part of a structural genomics initiative, 1000 open reading frames from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of malaria, were tested in an E. coli protein expression system. Three hundred and thirty-seven of these targets were observed to express, although typically the protein was insoluble. Sixty-three of the targets provided soluble protein in yields ranging from 0.9 to 406.6 mg from one liter of rich media. Higher molecular weight, greater protein disorder (segmental analysis, SEG), more basic isoelectric point (pI), and a lack of homology to E. coli proteins were all highly and independently correlated with difficulties in expression. Surprisingly, codon usage and the percentage of adenosines and thymidines (%AT) did not appear to play a significant role. Of those proteins which expressed, high pI and a hypothetical annotation were both strongly and independently correlated with insolubility. The overwhelmingly important role of pI in both expression and solubility appears to be a surprising and fundamental issue in the heterologous expression of P. falciparum proteins in E. coli. Twelve targets which did not express in E. coli from the native gene sequence were codon-optimized through whole gene synthesis, resulting in the (insoluble) expression of three of these proteins. Seventeen targets which were expressed insolubly in E. coli were moved into a baculovirus/Sf-21 system, resulting in the soluble expression of one protein at a high level and six others at a low level. A variety of factors conspire to make the heterologous expression of P. falciparum proteins challenging, and these observations lay the groundwork for a rational approach to prioritizing and, ultimately, eliminating these impediments.\n\nShort report: polymorphisms in the chloroquine resistance transporter gene in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Lombok, Indonesia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuaman, Maria Cecilia; Yoshinaga, Kazumi; Suryanatha, Aan; Suarsana, Nyoman; Kanbara, Hiroji\n\n2004-07-01\n\nThe polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) genes, which are associated with chloroquine resistance, were examined in 48 P. falciparum isolates from uncomplicated malaria patients from the West Lombok District in Indonesia. The point mutation N86Y in pfmdr1 was present in 35.4% of the isolates and mutation K76T in pfcrt was found in all but one of the samples studied. Identified pfcrt haplotypes were mainly identical to the Papua New Guinea type S(agt)VMNT (42 of 48, 87.5%), and a few isolates had the Southeast Asia type CVIET (5 of 48, 10.4%). Moreover, one P. falciparum isolate harbored the K76N mutation, giving rise to the haplotype CVMNN, which was not previously reported in field isolates. Our findings suggest that chloroquine resistance in this area might have the same origin as in Papua New Guinea.\n\nPrevalence of K13-propeller gene polymorphisms among Plasmodium falciparum parasites isolated from adult symptomatic patients in northern Uganda.\n\nPubMed\n\nOcan, Moses; Bwanga, Freddie; Okeng, Alfred; Katabazi, Fred; Kigozi, Edgar; Kyobe, Samuel; Ogwal-Okeng, Jasper; Obua, Celestino\n\n2016-08-19\n\nIn the absence of an effective vaccine, malaria treatment and eradication is still a challenge in most endemic areas globally. This is especially the case with the current reported emergence of resistance to artemisinin agents in Southeast Asia. This study therefore explored the prevalence of K13-propeller gene polymorphisms among Plasmodium falciparum parasites in northern Uganda. Adult patients (â¥18Â years) presenting to out-patients department of Lira and Gulu regional referral hospitals in northern Uganda were randomly recruited. Laboratory investigation for presence of plasmodium infection among patients was done using Plasmodium falciparum exclusive rapid diagnostic test, histidine rich protein-2 (HRP2) (Pf). Finger prick capillary blood from patients with a positive malaria test was spotted on a filter paper Whatman no. 903. The parasite DNA was extracted using chelex resin method and sequenced for mutations in K13-propeller gene using Sanger sequencing. PCR DNA sequence products were analyzed using in DNAsp 5.10.01software, data was further processed in Excel spreadsheet 2007. A total of 60 parasite DNA samples were sequenced. Polymorphisms in the K13-propeller gene were detected in four (4) of the 60 parasite DNA samples sequenced. A non-synonymous polymorphism at codon 533 previously detected in Cambodia was found in the parasite DNA samples analyzed. Polymorphisms at codon 522 (non-synonymous) and codon 509 (synonymous) were also found in the samples analyzed. The study found evidence of positive selection in the Plasmodium falciparum population in northern Uganda (Tajima's Dâ=â-1.83205; Fu and Li's Dâ=â-1.82458). Polymorphism in the K13-propeller gene previously reported in Cambodia has been found in the Ugandan Plasmodium falciparum parasites. There is need for continuous surveillance for artemisinin resistance gene markers in the country.\n\nRobust inducible Cre recombinase activity in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum enables efficient gene deletion within a single asexual erythrocytic growth cycle.\n\nPubMed\n\nCollins, Christine R; Das, Sujaan; Wong, Eleanor H; Andenmatten, Nicole; Stallmach, Robert; Hackett, Fiona; Herman, Jean-Paul; MÃ¼ller, Sylke; Meissner, Markus; Blackman, Michael J\n\n2013-05-01\n\nAsexual blood stages of the malaria parasite, which cause all the pathology associated with malaria, can readily be genetically modified by homologous recombination, enabling the functional study of parasite genes that are not essential in this part of the life cycle. However, no widely applicable method for conditional mutagenesis of essential asexual blood-stage malarial genes is available, hindering their functional analysis. We report the application of the DiCre conditional recombinase system to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most dangerous form of malaria. We show that DiCre can be used to obtain rapid, highly regulated site-specific recombination in P. falciparum, capable of excising loxP-flanked sequences from a genomic locus with close to 100% efficiency within the time-span of a single erythrocytic growth cycle. DiCre-mediated deletion of the SERA5 3' UTR failed to reduce expression of the gene due to the existence of alternative cryptic polyadenylation sites within the modified locus. However, we successfully used the system to recycle the most widely used drug resistance marker for P. falciparum, human dihydrofolate reductase, in the process producing constitutively DiCre-expressing P. falciparum clones that have broad utility for the functional analysis of essential asexual blood-stage parasite genes.

The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro sensitivity of Thai Plasmodium falciparum isolates against piperaquine and the influence of the pfmdr1 gene on in vitro response. One hundred and thirty-seven standard laboratory and adapted Thai isolates of P. falciparum were assessed for in vitro piperaquine sensitivity. Polymorphisms of the pfmdr1 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction methods. The mean and standard deviation of the piperaquine IC50 in Thai isolates of P. falciparum were 16.7 Â± 6.3 nM. The parasites exhibiting chloroquine IC50 of â¥ 100 nM were significantly less sensitive to piperaquine compared with the parasite with chloroquine IC50 of < 100 nM. No significant association between the pfmdr1 copy number and piperaquine IC50 values was found. In contrast, the parasites containing the pfmdr1 86Y allele exhibited significantly reduced piperaquine sensitivity. Before nationwide implementation of dihydroartemisininâpiperaquine as the first-line treatment in Thailand, in vitro and in vivo evaluations of this combination should be performed especially in areas where parasites containing the pfmdr1 86Y allele are predominant such as the ThaiâMalaysian border.

The primary structure of eba-175 is divided into seven regions, namely I to VII. Region III contains highly divergent dimorphic segments, termed Fseg and Cseg. The allele frequencies of segmental dimorphism within a P. falciparum population have been extensively examined; however, the molecular evolution of segmental dimorphism is not well understood. A comprehensive comparison of nucleotide sequences among 32 P. falciparum eba-175 alleles identified in our previous study, two Plasmodium reichenowi, and one P. gaboni orthologous alleles obtained from the GenBank database was conducted to uncover the origin and evolutionary processes of segmental dimorphism in P. falciparum eba-175. In the eba-175 nucleotide sequence derived from a P. reichenowi CDC strain, both Fseg and Cseg were found in region III, which implies that the original eba-175 gene had both segments, and deletions of F- and C-segments generated Cseg and Fseg alleles, respectively. We also confirmed the presence of allele with Fseg and Cseg in another P. reichenowi strain (SY57), by re-mapping short reads obtained from the GenBank database. On the other hand, the segmental sequence of eba-175 ortholog in P. gaboni was quite diverged from those of the other species, suggesting that the original eba-175 dimorphism of P. falciparum can be traced back to the stem linage of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi. Our findings suggest that Fseg and Cseg alleles are derived from a single eba-175 allele containing both segments in the ancestral population of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, and that the allelic dimorphism of eba-175 was shaped by the independent emergence of similar dimorphic lineage in different species that has never been observed in any evolutionary mode of allelic dimorphism at other loci in malaria genomes.

All\n\nPrevalence of pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 Gene Deletion in Plasmodium falciparum Population in Eight Highly Endemic States in India\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBharti, Praveen Kumar; Chandel, Himanshu Singh; Ahmad, Amreen; Krishna, Sri; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam; Singh, Neeru\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Plasmodium falciparum encoded histidine rich protein (HRP2) based malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in India. Deletion of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes contributes to false negative test results, and large numbers of such deletions have been reported from South America, highlighting the importance of surveillance to detect such deletions. Methods This is the first prospective field study carried out at 16 sites located in eight endemic states of India to assess the performance of PfHRP2 based RDT kits used in the national malaria control programme. In this study, microscopically confirmed P. falciparum but RDT negative samples were assessed for presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3, and their flanking genes using PCR. Results Among 1521 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples screened, 50 were negative by HRP2 based RDT test. Molecular testing was carried out using these 50 RDT negative samples by assuming that 1471 RDT positive samples carried pfhrp2 gene. It was found that 2.4% (36/1521) and 1.8% (27/1521) of samples were negative for pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively. However, the frequency of pfhrp2 deletions varied between the sites ranging from 0â25% (2.4, 95% CI; 1.6â3.3). The frequency of both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion varied from 0â8% (1.6, 95% CI; 1.0â2.4). Conclusion This study provides evidence for low level presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deleted P. falciparum parasites in different endemic regions of India, and periodic surveillance is warranted for reliable use of PfHRP2 based RDTs.

In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates from the Artibonite Valley in Haiti using the allelic families of merozoite surface protein 1 and 2 genes (msp-1 and msp-2). The majority of study subjects infected with P. falciparum had a single parasite genotype (56% for msp-1 and 69% for msp-2: n=79); 9 distinct msp-1 genotypes were identified by size differences on agarose gels. K1 was the most polymorphic allelic family with 5 genotypes (amplicons from 100 to 300 base pairs [bp]); RO33 was the least polymorphic, with a single genotype (120-bp). Although both msp-2 alleles (3D7/IC1, FC27) had similar number of genotypes (n=4), 3D7/IC1 was more frequent (85% vs. 26%). All samples were screened for the presence of the K76T mutation on the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene with 10 of 79 samples positive. Of the 2 (out of 10) samples from individuals follow-up for 21 days, P. falciparum parasites were present through day 7 after treatment with chloroquine. No parasites were found on day 21. Our results suggest that the level of genetic diversity is low in this area of Haiti, which is consistent with an area of low transmission. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although malaria has been studied for over a century, the elucidation of the full genome sequence of P. falciparum has now allowed for in-depth studies of gene expression throughout the entire intraerythrocytic stage. As the mainstays of anti-malarial chemotherapy become increasingly ineffective, we need a deeper understanding of fundamental plasmodial bioregulatory mechanisms to successfully subvert them. Recent gene expression studies have begun to examine different aspects of the IDC and are providing key insights into the basic mechanisms of Plasmodium gene regulation and are helping to define gene functions. However, to date, no transcription factor has been fully characterized from Plasmodium and the definitive identification of cis-acting regulatory elements along with their corresponding trans-acting partners is still lacking. The characterization of the transcriptome of P. falciparum is the first major step towards the understanding of the genome wide regulation of gene expression in this parasite. IDC expression data for almost every gene in the P. falciparum genome can now be publicly queried at and. The results of these studies suggest promising leads for identifying novel targets for anti-malarial therapeutics and vaccines in addition to providing a solid foundation for the ongoing elucidation of plasmodial gene expression.\n\nNovel Polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum ABC Transporter Genes Are Associated with Major ACT Antimalarial Drug Resistance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVeiga, Maria Isabel; Ferreira, Pedro Eduardo; JÃ¶rnhagen, Louise; Malmberg, Maja; Kone, Aminatou; Schmidt, Berit Aydin; Petzold, Max; BjÃ¶rkman, Anders; Nosten, Francois; Gil, Jose Pedro\n\n2011-01-01\n\nChemotherapy is a critical component of malaria control.

The recently sequenced genome of P. falciparum revealed over 5,400 genes, of which 60% encode proteins of unknown function. Insights into the biochemical function and regulation of these genes will provide the foundation for future drug and vaccine development efforts toward eradication of this disease. By analyzing the complete asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) transcriptome of the HB3 strain of P. falciparum, we demonstrate that at least 60% of the genome is transcriptionally active during this stage. Our data demonstrate that this parasite has evolved an extremely specialized mode of transcriptional regulation that produces a continuous cascade of gene expression, beginning with genes corresponding to general cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, and ending with Plasmodium-specific functionalities, such as genes involved in erythrocyte invasion. The data reveal that genes contiguous along the chromosomes are rarely coregulated, while transcription from the plastid genome is highly coregulated and likely polycistronic. Comparative genomic hybridization between HB3 and the reference genome strain (3D7) was used to distinguish between genes not expressed during the IDC and genes not detected because of possible sequence variations. Genomic differences between these strains were found almost exclusively in the highly antigenic subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. The simple cascade of gene regulation that directs the asexual development of P. falciparum is unprecedented in eukaryotic biology. The transcriptome of the IDC resembles a \"just-in-time\" manufacturing process whereby induction of any given gene occurs once per cycle and only at a time when it is required. These data provide to our knowledge the first comprehensive view of the timing of transcription throughout the intraerythrocytic\n\nAntigenic variation in malaria: in situ switching, relaxed and mutually exclusive transcription of var genes during intra-erythrocytic development in Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nScherf, A; Hernandez-Rivas, R; Buffet, P; Bottius, E; Benatar, C; Pouvelle, B; Gysin, J; Lanzer, M\n\n1998-01-01\n\nMembers of the Plasmodium falciparum var gene family encode clonally variant adhesins, which play an important role in the pathogenicity of tropical malaria. Here we employ a selective panning protocol to generate isogenic P.falciparum populations with defined adhesive phenotypes for CD36, ICAM-1 and CSA, expressing single and distinct var gene variants. This technique has established the framework for examining var gene expression, its regulation and switching. It was found that var gene switching occurs in situ. Ubiquitous transcription of all var gene variants appears to occur in early ring stages. However, var gene expression is tightly regulated in trophozoites and is exerted through a silencing mechanism. Transcriptional control is mutually exclusive in parasites that express defined adhesive phenotypes. In situ var gene switching is apparently mediated at the level of transcriptional initiation, as demonstrated by nuclear run-on analyses. Our results suggest that an epigenetic mechanism(s) is involved in var gene regulation.

This analysis revealed high genetic diversity of PfAMA1 in global P. falciparum populations with a total of 229 haplotypes identified. The genetic diversity of PfAMA1 gene from the China-Myanmar border is not evenly distributed in the different domains of this gene. Sequence diversity in PfAMA1 from the China-Myanmar border is lower than that observed in Thai, African and Oceanian populations, but higher than that in the South American population. This appeared to correlate well with the levels of endemicity of different malaria-endemic regions, where hyperendemic regions favor genetic cross of the parasite isolates and generation of higher genetic diversity. Neutrality tests show significant departure from neutrality in the entire ectodomain and Domain I of PfAMA1 in the China-Myanmar border parasite population. We found evidence supporting a substantial continent-wise genetic structure among P. falciparum populations, with the highest genetic differentiation detected between the China-Myanmar border and the South American populations. Whereas no alleles were unique to a specific region, there were considerable geographical differences in major alleles and their frequencies, highlighting further necessity to include more PfAMA1 alleles in vaccine designs.

Each var gene contains a conserved intron which has been implicated in previous studies in both activation and repression of transcription via several epigenetic mechanisms, including interaction with the var promoter, production of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and localization to repressive perinuclear sites. However, functional studies have relied primarily on artificial expression constructs. Using the recently developed P.Â falciparum clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, we directly deleted the var2csa P.Â falciparum 3D7_1200600 (Pf3D7_1200600) endogenous intron, resulting in an intronless var gene in a natural, marker-free chromosomal context. Deletion of the var2csa intron resulted in an upregulation of transcription of the var2csa gene in ring-stage parasites and subsequent expression of the PfEMP1 protein in late-stage parasites. Intron deletion did not affect the normal temporal regulation and subsequent transcriptional silencing of the var gene in trophozoites but did result in increased rates of var gene switching in some mutant clones. Transcriptional repression of the intronless var2csa gene could be achieved via long-term culture or panning with the CD36 receptor, after which reactivation was possible with chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) panning. These data suggest that the var2csa intron is not required for silencing or activation in ring-stage parasites but point to a subtle role in regulation of switching within the var gene family. IMPORTANCE Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent species of malaria parasite, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality in those infected. Chronic infection depends on an immune evasion mechanism termed antigenic variation, which in turn relies on monoallelic expression of 1 of ~60 var genes.

The emergence of artemisinin resistance has been observed in this area since 2008-2009 and molecular signatures associated to artemisinin resistance have been characterized in k13 gene. At present, one of the major threats faced, is the possible spread of Asian artemisinin resistant parasites over the world threatening millions of people and jeopardizing malaria elimination programme efforts. To anticipate the diffusion of artemisinin resistance, the identification of the P. falciparum population structure and the gene flow among the parasite population in Cambodia are essential. To this end, a mid-throughput PCR-LDR-FMA approach based on LUMINEX technology was developed to screen for genetic barcode in 533 blood samples collected in 2010-2011 from 16 health centres in malaria endemics areas in Cambodia. Based on successful typing of 282 samples, subpopulations were characterized along the borders of the country. Each 11-loci barcode provides evidence supporting allele distribution gradient related to subpopulations and gene flow. The 11-loci barcode successfully identifies recently emerging parasite subpopulations in western Cambodia that are associated with the C580Y dominant allele for artemisinin resistance in k13 gene. A subpopulation was identified in northern Cambodia that was associated to artemisinin (R539T resistant allele of k13 gene) and mefloquine resistance. The gene flow between these subpopulations might have driven the spread of artemisinin resistance over Cambodia.\n\nPopulation structuring of multi-copy, antigen-encoding genes in Plasmodium falciparum\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArtzy-Randrup, Yael; Rorick, Mary M; Day, Karen; Chen, Donald; Dobson, Andrew P; Pascual, Mercedes\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe coexistence of multiple independently circulating strains in pathogen populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question of epidemiology with profound implications for control. An agent-based model is developed that extends earlier âstrain theoryâ by addressing the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum. The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts, and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity.

Using previously described universal PCR primers for the first Duffy binding-like domain (DBLalpha) of var we analysed the DBLalpha repertoires of Dd2 (originally from Thailand) and eight isolates from the Solomon Islands (n=4), Philippines (n=2), Papua New Guinea (n=1) and Africa (n=1). We found 15-32 unique DBLalpha sequence types among these isolates and estimated detectable DBLalpha repertoire sizes ranging from 33-38 to 52-57 copies per genome. Our data suggest that var gene repertoires generally consist of 40-50 copies per genome. Eighteen DBLalpha sequences appeared in more than one Asia-Pacific isolate with the number of sequences shared between any two isolates ranging from 0 to 6 (mean=2.0 +/-1.6). At the amino acid level DBLalpha sequence similarity within isolates ranged from 45.2 +/- 7.1 to 50.2 +/- 6.9%, and was not significantly different from the DBLalpha amino acid sequence similarity among isolates (P>0.1). Comparisons with published sequences also revealed little overlap among DBLalpha sequences from different regions. High DBLalpha sequence diversity and minimal overlap among these isolates suggest that the global var gene repertoire is immense, and may potentially be selected for by the host's protective immune response to the var gene products, PfEMP1.\n\nComputational synchronization of microarray data with application to Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Wei; Dauwels, Justin; Niles, Jacquin C; Cao, Jianshu\n\n2012-06-21\n\nMicroarrays are widely used to investigate the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Starting with synchronized cells, gene expression levels are continually measured over the 48-hour intra-erythrocytic cycle (IDC). However, the cell population gradually loses synchrony during the experiment. As a result, the microarray measurements are blurred. In this paper, we propose a generalized deconvolution approach to reconstruct the intrinsic expression pattern, and apply it to P. falciparum IDC microarray data. We develop a statistical model for the decay of synchrony among cells, and reconstruct the expression pattern through statistical inference. The proposed method can handle microarray measurements with noise and missing data. The original gene expression patterns become more apparent in the reconstructed profiles, making it easier to analyze and interpret the data. We hypothesize that reconstructed gene expression patterns represent better temporally resolved expression profiles that can be probabilistically modeled to match changes in expression level to IDC transitions. In particular, we identify transcriptionally regulated protein kinases putatively involved in regulating the P. falciparum IDC. By analyzing publicly available microarray data sets for the P. falciparum IDC, protein kinases are ranked in terms of their likelihood to be involved in regulating transitions between the ring, trophozoite and schizont developmental stages of the P. falciparum IDC. In our theoretical framework, a few protein kinases have high probability rankings, and could potentially be involved in regulating these developmental transitions. This study proposes a new methodology for extracting intrinsic expression patterns from microarray data. By applying this method to P. falciparum microarray data, several protein kinases are predicted to play a significant role in the P. falciparum IDC. Earlier experiments have indeed confirmed that several of these kinases are involved\n\nMosquito Vectors and the Globalization of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolina-Cruz, Alvaro; Zilversmit, Martine M; Neafsey, Daniel E; Hartl, Daniel L; Barillas-Mury, Carolina\n\n2016-11-23\n\nPlasmodium falciparum malaria remains a devastating public health problem. Recent discoveries have shed light on the origin and evolution of Plasmodium parasites and their interactions with their vertebrate and mosquito hosts. P. falciparum malaria originated in Africa from a single horizontal transfer between an infected gorilla and a human, and became global as the result of human migration. Today, P. falciparum malaria is transmitted worldwide by more than 70 different anopheline mosquito species. Recent studies indicate that the mosquito immune system can be a barrier to malaria transmission and that the P. falciparum Pfs47 gene allows the parasite to evade mosquito immune detection. Here, we review the origin and globalization of P. falciparum and integrate this history with analysis of the biology, evolution, and dispersal of the main mosquito vectors. This new perspective broadens our understanding of P. falciparum population structure and the dispersal of important parasite genetic traits.\n\nEvolution of genetic polymorphisms of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein (PfMSP) in Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuesap, Jiraporn; Chaijaroenkul, Wanna; Ketprathum, Kanchanok; Tattiyapong, Puntanat; Na-Bangchang, Kesara\n\n2014-02-01\n\nPlasmodium falciparum malaria is a major public health problem in Thailand due to the emergence of multidrug resistance. The understanding of genetic diversity of malaria parasites is essential for developing effective drugs and vaccines. The genetic diversity of the merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1) and merozoite surface protein-2 (PfMSP-2) genes was investigated in a total of 145 P. falciparum isolates collected from Mae Sot District, Tak Province, Thailand during 3 different periods (1997-1999, 2005-2007, and 2009-2010). Analysis of genetic polymorphisms was performed to track the evolution of genetic change of P. falciparum using PCR. Both individual genes and their combination patterns showed marked genetic diversity during the 3 study periods. The results strongly support that P. falciparum isolates in Thailand are markedly diverse and patterns changed with time. These 2 polymorphic genes could be used as molecular markers to detect multiple clone infections and differentiate recrudescence from reinfection in P. falciparum isolates in Thailand.\n\nEpigenetic Silencing of Plasmodium falciparum Genes Linked to Erythrocyte Invasion\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCortÃ©s, Alfred; Carret, Celine; Kaneko, Osamu; Yim Lim, Brian Y. S.; Ivens, Alasdair; Holder, Anthony A\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe process of erythrocyte invasion by merozoites of Plasmodium falciparum involves multiple steps, including the formation of a moving junction between parasite and host cell, and it is characterised by the redundancy of many of the receptorâligand interactions involved. Several parasite proteins that interact with erythrocyte receptors or participate in other steps of invasion are encoded by small subtelomerically located gene families of four to seven members. We report here that members of the eba, rhoph1/clag, acbp, and pfRh multigene families exist in either an active or a silenced state. In the case of two members of the rhoph1/clag family, clag3.1 and clag3.2, expression was mutually exclusive. Silencing was clonally transmitted and occurred in the absence of detectable DNA alterations, suggesting that it is epigenetic. This was demonstrated for eba-140. Our data demonstrate that variant or mutually exclusive expression and epigenetic silencing in Plasmodium are not unique to genes such as var, which encode proteins that are exported to the surface of the erythrocyte, but also occur for genes involved in host cell invasion. Clonal variant expression of invasion-related ligands increases the flexibility of the parasite to adapt to its human host.

Studies indicate that copy number increase and key alleles in the pfmdr1 gene are associated with AS+MQ resistance. In the present study, we investigated evidence for a selective sweep around pfmdr1 because of the spread of adaptive mutation and/or multiple copies of this gene in the P. falciparum population in Cambodia. Methods We characterized 13 microsatellite loci flanking (Â± 99 kb) pfmdr1 in 93 single-clone P. falciparum infections, of which 31 had multiple copies and 62 had a single copy of the pfmdr1 gene. Results Genetic analysis revealed no difference in the mean (Â± standard deviation) expected heterozygosity (He) at loci around single (0.75 Â± 0.03) and multiple (0.76 Â± 0.04) copies of pfmdr1. Evidence of genetic hitchhiking with the selective sweep of certain haplotypes was seen around mutant (184F) pfmdr1 allele, irrespective of the copy number. There was an overall reduction of 28% in mean He (Â± SD) around mutant allele (0.56 Â± 0.05), compared with wild-type allele (0.84 Â± 0.02). Significant linkage disequilibrium was also observed between the loci flanking mutant pfmdr1 allele. Conclusion The 184F mutant allele is under selection, whereas amplification of pfmdr1 gene in this population occurs on multiple genetic backgrounds.

The rate at which antibody responses to VSA expressed by circulating parasites are acquired depends on the size of the local VSA repertoire and the frequency of exposure to new VSA. Because parasites from areas with declining malaria endemicity, such as the Amazon, typically express a restricted PfEMP-1 repertoire, we hypothesized that Amazonians would rapidly acquire antibodies to most locally circulating VSA. Consistent with our expectations, the analysis of 5878 sequence tags expressed by 10 local P.Â falciparum samples revealed little PfEMP-1 DBL1Î± domain diversity. Among the most commonly expressed DBL1Î± types, 45% were shared by two or more independent parasite lines. Nevertheless, Amazonians displayed major gaps in their repertoire of anti-VSA antibodies, although the breadth of anti-VSA antibody responses correlated positively with their cumulative exposure to malaria. We found little antibody cross-reactivity even when testing VSA from related parasites expressing the same dominant DBL1Î± types. We conclude that variant-specific immunity to P.Â falciparum VSAs develops slowly despite the relatively restricted PfEMP-1 repertoire found in low-endemicity settings.

Convenient laboratory studies have identified mosquito genes that affect positively or negatively the developmental cycle of the model rodent parasite, P. berghei. Here, we use transcription profiling and reverse genetics to explore whether five disparate mosquito gene regulators of P. berghei development are also pertinent to A. gambiae/P. falciparum interactions in semi-natural conditions, using field isolates of this parasite and geographically related mosquitoes. We detected broadly similar albeit not identical transcriptional responses of these genes to the two parasite species. Gene silencing established that two genes affect similarly both parasites: infections are hindered by the intracellular local activator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, WASP, but promoted by the hemolymph lipid transporter, ApoII/I. Since P. berghei is not a natural parasite of A. gambiae, these data suggest that the effects of these genes have not been drastically altered by constant interaction and co-evolution of A. gambiae and P. falciparum; this conclusion allowed us to investigate further the mode of action of these two genes in the laboratory model system using a suite of genetic tools and infection assays. We showed that both genes act at the level of midgut invasion during the parasite's developmental transition from ookinete to oocyst. ApoII/I also affects the early stages of oocyst development. These are the first mosquito genes whose significant effects on P. falciparum field isolates have been established by direct experimentation. Importantly, they validate for semi-field human malaria transmission the concept of parasite antagonists and agonists.\n\nDNA Sequence Polymorphism of the Lactate Dehydrogenase Genefrom Iranian Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum Isolates.\n\nPubMed\n\nGetacher Feleke, Daniel; Nateghpour, Mehdi; Motevalli Haghi, Afsaneh; Hajjaran, Homa; Farivar, Leila; Mohebali, Mehdi; Raoofian, Reza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nParasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) is extensively employed as malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Moreover, it is a well-known drug target candidate. However, the genetic diversity of this gene might influence performance of RDT kits and its drug target candidacy. This study aimed to determine polymorphism of pLDH gene from Iranian isolates of P. vivax and P. falciparum. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood of microscopically confirmed P. vivax and P. falciparum infected patients. pLDH gene of P. falciparum and P. vivax was amplified using conventional PCR from 43 symptomatic malaria patients from Sistan and Baluchistan Province, Southeast Iran from 2012 to 2013. Sequence analysis of 15 P. vivax LDH showed fourteen had 100% identity with P. vivax Sal-1 and Belem strains. Two nucleotide substitutions were detected with only one resulted in amino acid change. Analysis of P. falciparum LDH sequences showed six of the seven sequences had 100% homology with P. falciparum 3D7 and Mzr-1. Moreover, PfLDH displayed three nucleotide changes that resulted in changing only one amino acid. PvLDH and PfLDH showed 75%-76% nucleotide and 90.4%-90.76% amino acid homology. pLDH gene from Iranian P. falciparum and P. vivax isolates displayed 98.8-100% homology with 1-3 nucleotide substitutions. This indicated this gene was relatively conserved. Additional studies can be done weather this genetic variation can influence the performance of pLDH based RDTs or not.\n\nAssessment of copy number variation in genes related to drug resistance in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Brazilian Amazon and a systematic review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nCosta, Gabriel LuÃ­z; Amaral, Lara Cotta; Fontes, Cor Jesus Fernandes; Carvalho, Luzia Helena; de Brito, Cristiana Ferreira Alves; de Sousa, TaÃ­s NÃ³brega\n\n2017-04-19\n\nParasite resistance to anti-malarials represents a great obstacle for malaria elimination. The majority of studies have investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and drug resistance; however, it is becoming clear that the copy number variation (CNV) is also associated with this parasite phenotype. To provide a baseline for molecular surveillance of anti-malarial drug resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, the present study characterized the genetic profile of both markers in the most common genes associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax isolates. Additionally, these data were compared to data published elsewhere applying a systematic review of the literature published over a 20-year time period. The genomic DNA of 67 patients infected by P. falciparum and P. vivax from three Brazilian States was obtained between 2002 and 2012. CNV in P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene-1 (pfmdr1), GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) and P. vivax multidrug resistance gene-1 (pvmdr1) were assessed by real-time PCR assays. SNPs in the pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes were assessed by PCR-RFLP. A literature search for studies that analysed CNP in the same genes of P. falciparum and P. vivax was conducted between May 2014 and March 2017 across four databases. All analysed samples of P. f"
