Former BYU basketball player Rafael Araujo will return back to his home away from home, as the Utah Jazz acquired him in a trade with the Toronto Raptors. The Jazz traded forward Kris Humphries and center Robert Whaley to the Raptors in exchange for Araujo and cash.

'I look forward to returning to Utah,' Araujo said. 'It is a beautiful place. The last two summers I have come back to visit players and coaches. It is a great community.

After being drafted with the 8th overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft, Araujo played two seasons with the Raptors. The native Brazilian played two seasons of college ball at Arizona Western College before transferring to BYU. While at BYU, Araujo appeared in 125 games for the Cougars and was named the Mountain West Co-Player of the Year and First Team All-Mountain West as a senior.

Playing some of his college ball in Utah, Araujo said he had the opportunity to watch the Jazz but he has never really met Jazz head coach Jerry Sloan. However, he hears that he is a great person.

Humphries played two seasons for the Jazz, and was originally selected by the Jazz with the 14th pick in the 2004 NBA draft.

Whaley was the 51st pick of the second round of the 2005 NBA Draft and played his rookie season for the Jazz in 2005-06.

While with the Raptors, Araujo averaged 2.9 points, three rebounds and 12.1 minutes per game. Despite little playing time, Araujo still was able to improve.

'The two years that I have been in the NBA with the Raptors I have been able to understand the NBA more,' he said. 'I''m more prepared now.'

The 6-11 and 290 pound center will move from a team below .500 (27-55) to a team with a .500 record (41-41), who barely missed the playoffs.

'It is a great opportunity to return to this city,' he said. 'It is like a dream come true.'
