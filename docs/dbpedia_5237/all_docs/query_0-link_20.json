        "text": "When he was younger, growing up big and beefy in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil, a coach summoned the courage to hang a new nickname on Rafael Araujo.\n\n\"One of my coaches decided to call me Baby, because I was tall and had a young face, a baby face,\" Araujo said. \"Everybody started calling me Baby, Baby, Baby. And everybody knew me as Baby after that.\"\n\nAraujo said he had no problem with his new moniker until, years later, when he was a basketball star at Western Arizona College, where he met and married Cheyenne, a volleyball player at the school.\n\n\"Once I came to the States it was a little weird,\" Araujo said, adding with an impish grin: \"The girls called me Baby Baby a lot. My wife didn't like that.\"\n\nGiven he's 6 foot 11 and 290 pounds, baby is not exactly the first image to pop into your mind when you take stock of Araujo, the Toronto Raptors' spanking new bouncing boy. Baby Huey would be more like it.\n\nAraujo emerged into the Raptors' world at about 8:15 p.m. on Thursday when the club selected the relatively unknown player with its first pick (eighth overall) in the National Basketball Association draft.\n\nDuring an otherwise hectic draft night, the delivery went off without a hitch, thanks to the steady hand of Rob Babcock, who was overseeing his first major procedure since he was appointed Toronto's new general manager on June 7.\n\nThe proud Raptors introduced their latest family member to the media at the Air Canada Centre yesterday.\n\nGiven the city's strict no-smoking bylaws, cigars were in short supply to help commemorate the event. Nonetheless, there was still enough hot air in the room to make it a festive occasion.\n\n\"He's a tough son of a gun,\" offered Richard Peddie, the president and chief executive officer of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Raptors. \"He may be the toughest player we've ever had.\"\n\nThat may be news to the likes of former old hands Charles Oakley and Antonio Davis, and even current team member Alvin Williams.\n\nBut Peddie was perhaps caught up in the euphoria when he offered his effusive praise of a 23-year-old who has yet to play a single second in the NBA.\n\nBabcock, who has 17 years of NBA management experience, most recently as the vice-president of player personnel for the Minnesota Timberwolves, is also deeply impressed with Araujo.\n\n\"He exemplifies everything we want in our basketball philosophy,\" said Babcock, who has yet to hire a coach. \"He is a tough, hard-nosed, competitive player. He gives 100 per cent every single time he steps across that line, and he's a team player. He supports his teammates on the court and off the court.\n\n\"And to top it off, he's a very good basketball player. I think that you will be very, very pleased with what you see on the court from our first round draft pick.\"\n\nAll this is pretty heady stuff for Araujo, who was unable to speak a word of English just four years ago when he struck out from Sao Paulo for the United States to try to take advantage of his big build and learn the craft of basketball.\n\n\"When I got to the airport in L.A., I couldn't speak one word,\" Araujo said, recalling his most arduous moment in his new land. \"I had to get another airplane. I had to grab somebody by the arm and say, 'Please, help me.' A Brazalian lady, she just helped me, she was cool about it.\"\n\nSurvival became Araujo's motto, and he honed his boisterous basketball skills at Arizona Western College for two years, during which he also met Cheyenne, got married and fathered a daughter, Tais.\n\nThen it was on to Brigham Young University in Utah for two more years of seasoning. As a senior, he led BYU in scoring (18.4), rebounds (10.1), steals (1.4) and blocks (0.8) a game.\n\n\"Everything was new for me -- no English,\" he said. \"I came here, I couldn't speak one word. No money in my wallet, my little bag. Just a big dream. That was the thing I was here for. I knew that for the goal, what I wanted to be, I had to work hard to improve my game.\n\n\"Today, I'm here to make my dream come true.\"\n\nFrom Brazil to Arizona to Utah and now to Canada, Araujo's path to the NBA is remarkable."
