BYU finished nonconference play with a 10-3 record, including the Cable Car Classic title and a win over Big XII champion Oklahoma State. BYU has the MWC's top RPI (31) and strength of schedule ratings. BYU returns four starters from last year's 23-9 co-championship team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament. Swingman Travis Hansen (drafted and playing with the Atlanta Hawks) and sixth man Ricky Bower (out all season with an injury) are two top players not with this year's team. Among returning players, senior center Rafael Araujo is theMountain West's Co-Player of the Year and an All-MWC First Team pick, while four-year starter Mark Bigelow earned second-team honors. NJCAA All-American transfer Mike Hall garnered third-team recognition and was named MWC Defensive Player of the Year. Senior guard Kevin Woodberry (5.2 ppg, 2.1 apg) and junior forward Jared Jensen (3.9 ppg, 2.2 rpg) were starters last season and have been key contributors this year but primarily coming off the bench. Newcomers Hall and freshmen Garner Meads have earned starting assignments. Araujo is averaging 18.2 points and 10.0 rebounds to lead BYU this year. Bigelow adds 13.3 points and 3.8 rebounds while Hall contributes 12.7 points and 3.5 rebounds. First-year starter Luiz Lemes, a senior combo guard in his second year in Provo, leads the team in assists (4.4). Meads adds 4.4 points and 2.8 rebounds. Senior Jake Shoff (2.8 ppg, 2.6 rpg) has played well off the bench, especially of late since overcoming some injuries. As a team, the Cougars shoot .487 from the floor, .348 on threes, and .725 from the line while scoring 73.3 points per game. BYU allows 65.0 points while the opposition has shot .448 (FG) and .340 (3FG). BYU has an average rebounding advantage of 5.4.\n\nSYRACUSE ORANGEMEN\n\nThe Syracuse University men's basketball team begins defense of its 2003 NCAA Championship with a first-round matchup against BYU in Denver, Colo., on Thursday, March 18. Syracuse (21-7) earned a fifth seed while BYU (21-8) is seeded 12th. The Orangemen enter the tournament having won five of their last six outings, including victories over nationally-ranked Pittsburgh (49-46 in overtime) and Connecticut (67-56). Syracuse, seeded fourth in last week's BIG EAST Tournament after tying for third in the regular season, was bounced in its opener with Boston College, 57-54. Syracuse also saw NCAA Tournament action in Denver in 1996 when the city hosted the West Region Semifinal and final. Syracuse defeated Georgia, 83-81 in overtime, and Kansas, 60-57, to advance to the Final Four. SU has a 46-28 record in NCAA Tournament play, a record that covers 28 appearances dating back to 1957. Coach Jim Boeheim, who has taken 23 of his 28 teams into the NCAAs, owns a 38-21 record in NCAA postseason games. He ranks seventh on the all-time NCAA Division I Tournament win ledger. Syracuse has three starters back from last year's championship club - junior forward Hakim Warrick (19.6 ppg., 8.8 rpg.), junior center Craig Forth (5.8 ppg., 5.4 rpg.), and sophomore guard Gerry McNamara (16.2 ppg., 2.6 rpg.). Junior guard Josh Pace (9.9 ppg., 5.5 rpg.), a valuable reserve last season, is another regular in the starting lineup. Freshman forward Demetris Nichols (3.8 ppg., 2.1 rpg.) has started SU's last 12 games. Gone from the title team is Carmelo Anthony, last year's Final Four MVP, and captain Kueth Duany. Anthony is currently a member of the Denver Nuggets. Duany is playing professional basketball in Isreal.\n\nSYRACUSE'S LAST OUTING\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. - Sophomore guard Gerry McNamara is Syracuse University's single-season three-point field goals record holder with 89 this year. He hit four in fourth-seeded SU's 57-54 loss to fifth-seeded Boston College in the quarterfinals of the 2004 BIG EAST Tournament at Madison Square Garden. McNamara led the #19/23 Orangemen (21-7 overall) with 15 points in the game. McNamara broke Preston Shumpert's three-point field goal record of 88, which Shumpert set in 2001-02, with a three-pointer that gave SU a 10-point lead, 41-31, with 14:48 remaining in the game. The Eagles (23-8) responded with a 6-0 run in the next 2:15 to cut the SU lead to four, 41-37. After a jump shot by SU's Hakim Warrick, Eagles center Craig Smith scored nine straight points for BC, which outscored the Orangemen 14-10 in the next nine minutes to tie the game at 51 with 2:51 left to play. Boston College's Jared Dudley hit two free throws to give the Eagles their first lead of the game, 55-54, with 37.5 seconds left to play. Then Smith scored two of his game-high 22 points on two free throws with six seconds left to give the Eagles their three-point margin of victory. McNamara's three-point field goal attempt to tie the game bounced off the back of the rim at the buzzer. McNamara is currently tied for fourth on SU's career three-point field goals record list with 175 (DeShaun Williams, 175, 1999-02). Shumpert holds the record with 249. Warrick finished the game with 12 points, while junior Josh Pace scored 12 points and led SU with seven rebounds. SU blocked 10 of the Eagles' shots, increasing its season total to 192 (6.86 per game), which ranks second nationally. Senior center Jeremy McNeil and Warrick each had three rejections. McNeil ranks fifth on SU's career blocked shots record list with 253 in 132 games. Prior to the BIG EAST quarterfinal game, SU was 7-0 when its opponent scored less than 60 points. SU head coach Jim Boeheim ranks 19th on the all-time Division I coaching list for victories with 674, which is one shy of Denny Crum, who is in 18th place with 675 wins.\n\nSYRACUSE'S PROJECTED STARTERS (BASED ON LAST GAME)\n\nPOS.#NAMEHT.WT.YR.PPGRPG\n\nF4Demetris Nichols6-8205Fr.3.82.1\n\nF1Hakim Warrick6-8209Jr.19.68.8\n\nC51Craig Forth7-0259Jr.5.85.6\n\nG5Josh Pace6-5195Jr.9.95.5\n\nG3Gerry McNamara6-2179So.16.22.6\n\nSERIES NOTES\n\nBYU and Syracuse have met four times. The Orangemen have won all four meetings but the two teams have not played since a 1968 matchup in Provo, Utah. The first two games were played in 1947 and then the Cougars and Orangemen faced each other again in 1951. This is the second neutral court game between the two teams, with Syracuse topping BYU, 53-43, at the 1947 Los Angeles Invitational. This is the first postseason meeting between the two teams.\n\nBYU VS.

The Cougars have achieved 21 wins even though they have played more games (16) away (8-8 record) from home than they did in the Marriott Center where BYU was a perfect 13-0. The Cougars finished the season strong, winning nine straight games until being upset by Utah in the MWC Tournament semifinals. BYU has an RPI of 31 and strenghth of schedule rated No. 35. BYU has quality wins, including a neutral court victory over current No. 3 Oklahoma State, the Big XII champs.\n\nCOUGAR NCAA NOTABLES\n\n-- This will be BYU's 21st NCAA Tournament appearance. The Cougars have an 11-23 record in their prior 20 NCAA Appearances. They last advanced to the NCAA Tournament last season, losing 58-53 in the first round to Connecticut in Spokane, Wash.\n\n-- BYU coach Steve Cleveland has guided the Cougars to the NCAA Tournament three out of the last four seasons, including back-to-back appearances the last two years. In his seventh year at BYU, Cleveland has guided the Cougars to postseason in each of the past five seasons. He has returned the Cougar program to an annual tournament participant since taking over a program that was 1-25 the season before his arrival.\n\n-- This is the first time BYU has played an NCAA Tournament game in Denver.\n\n-- BYU has been a No. 12 seed in each of its last three NCAA appearances (2001, 2003, 2004).\n\n-- BYU has lost in the first round in its last three NCAA appearances. BYU's last NCAA win was in 1993 as a No. 7 seed in Chicago when the Cougars defeated SMU, 80-71. BYU lost to No. 2-seed Kansas, 90-76, in the second round that year.\n\n-- BYU is 7-13 in its opening round games in NCAA Tournament play.\n\n-- The last time BYU advanced out of the second round was in 1981 when the Cougars (as a No. 6 seed), defeated Princeton, 60-51 before upsetting No. 3-seed UCLA 78-55. BYU went on to defeat No. 2-seed Notre Dame on Danny Ainge's last-second, length-of-the-court dash, 51-50, to advance to the Regional Finals before losing to Ralph Sampson and No. 1-seed Virginia, 74-60.\n\nPOTENTIAL SECOND ROUND MATCHUPS\n\nThe BYU vs. Syracuse winner will face the victor between No. 4-seed Maryland (19-11) and No. 13-seed UTEP (24-7).\n\nMARYLAND TERRAPINS\n\nMaryland (19-11) finished the regular season of the Atlantic Coast Conference as the No. 6 seed before winning its first tournament title in 20 years by beating No. 5 Duke 95-87 in overtime Sunday - ending the top-seeded Blue Devils' run at five straight championships. It was the first ACC tournament title for the Terrapins since 1984, when Len Bias and coach Lefty Driesell beat Duke. Tournament MVP John Gilchrist led Maryland to victory. The sophomore guard put together a terrific three-game stretch to help the Terps beat the Nos. 3, 2 and 1 seeds. Gilchrist made the game-winning free throw in a quarterfinal win over No. 15 Wake Forest, he scored a career-high 30 points in a semifinal win over North Carolina State and capped it with 26 points against Duke on 10-of-20 shooting.\n\nSERIES VS. MARYLAND\n\nBYU and Maryland have never played. Maryland is the only ACC team the Cougars have not faced.\n\nUTEP MINERS\n\nUTEP earned its first invitation to the NCAA Tournament in 14 years. The Miners (24-7), regular-season co-champions of the Western Athletic Conference, are making their 15th NCAA Tournament appearance, and first since 1992. The Miners won the 1966 national title. To this day UTEP is the only school in the state of Texas to win a national championship in men's basketball. The Miners' NCAA Tournament record is 14-13. Nevada defeated the Miners 66-60 on Saturday to win the WAC Tournament title.Omar Thomas (15.5 ppg) leads four Miners who average double figures for coach Billy Gillispie.\n\nSERIES VS. UTEP\n\nBYU, a former Western Athletic Conference member, has played UTEP 64 times, leading the series 39-25 over the Miners. The two teams last met in 1999, splitting the season series with home wins. BYU has a 1-0 record against the Miners on a neutral floor. In that game, the Cougars' Kevin Nixon hit a dramatic three-quarter-court shot at the buzzer to defeat UTEP, 73-71, in Fort Collins, Colo., to win the 1992 WAC Tournament title.\n\nOverall Series Record: BYU leads, 39-25\n\nBYU Record in Provo: 23-10\n\nBYU Record in El Paso: 15-14\n\nBYU Record at Neutral Sites: 1-0\n\nBYU Record Under Steve Cleveland: 2-2\n\nBYU Record in Overtime Games: 5-4\n\nLast Overtime Game: BYU won 3OT in El Paso, 76-75 in 1998\n\nLongest BYU Win Streak: 7 (1977-80)\n\nLongest UTEP Win Streak: 3 9three times in 1976-77, 1988-89 and 1997-98)\n\nLargest BYU Margin of Victory: 27, 75-48 in 1971\n\nLargest UTEP Margin of Victory: 26, twice in 1975 and 1997\n\nMost Points Scored by BYU: 95 in 1995\n\nMost Points Scored by UTEP: 97 in 1985\n\n2004 MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nAfter its first four years in Las Vegas, this year's Mountain West Conference Basketball Championship was played at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colo. Utah won the 2004 tournament, edging UNLV to claim the MWC's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. It was the Utes first MWC Tournament title and their first finals appearance. In the five years of the MWC, a different team has won the tournament each year. Past MWC Tournament champions include UNLV (2000), BYU (2001), San Diego State (2002), Colorado State (2003) and Utah (2004).\n\nBYU's MWC RECAPS\n\nGAME 29 RECAP -- HEARTBREAKER ENDS COUGARS VICTORY STREAK\n\nDENVER -- The Mountain West Conference Tournament ended for the No. 2-seeded BYU men's basketball team on Friday, with a heartbreaking 54-51 loss to the No. 3-seeded University of Utah at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The loss snapped the Cougars' nine-game winning streak that had pushed their overall record to 21-8 and 10-4 in the MWC. It also means the Cougars will not receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament and must await a decision from the NCAA Selection Committee. \"It's hard to know what the committee is thinking, I know that our credentials are solid in every area,\" said head coach Steve Cleveland. \"If you compare our criteria with other teams in the West, we are right at the top. This team has done everything it can do to get a berth.\" Some of what the Cougars have done is go 9-1 in their last 10 games -- one of the biggest criteria for the committee. The team improved its RPI ranking to a conference best No. 27 and went from last place in conference to finishing second in the regular season. \"In my 27 years of coaching I have never seen a team as focused as this one, to come from last to second and win nine games in a row,\" said Cleveland. On the night, BYU shot 46.7 percent on 21-of-45 shooting with senior Rafael Araujo scoring a team-high 13 points and pulling down eight rebounds. Both junior Mike Hall and senior Luiz Lemes contributed nine points for BYU to round out the top three Cougars scorers. The Cougars put up 20 points in the first half. It was their second-lowest point total in a half on the season after a 19-point performance at the Air Force Academy back on Jan. 24. \"It wasn't our best offensive game but we found our offense in the second half,\" said Cleveland. \"We found the flow (in the second half) and put ourselves in a position to win but it came down to the end and we lost,\" said Cleveland. \"We could never find our rhythm,\" said senior guard Mark Bigelow, \"We weren't aggressive and nobody could hit a shot. If you score 20 points in the first half you are going to be in trouble in any game.\" Cleveland added, \"We've won games in the last few seconds but tonight it didn't happen. We've had the ball bounce our way many times in the last six week -- just not tonight.\" The first half turned into a defensive battle with both teams struggling from the field. BYU went a combined 8-for-23 for 20 points while Utah was 9-of-26 for 26 points over the first 20 minutes. Utah struck first in the half, connecting on back-to-back threes before Hall knocked down a trey of his own at the 17:17 mark. The Cougars' Woodberry tied up the ball game at 12 apiece with a three point shot of his own but the tie didn't last long as the Utes went on a 7-2 run over the next six minutes to pull ahead 19-14 with 4:21 to go before the break. With 2:32 left in the half, Araujo was fouled by the Utes' Andrew Bogut but a questionable elbow to Bogut's head landed Araujo his first foul of the game in the form of a technical. Utah's Nick Jacobson made good on one of his two technical free throws to make it a 20-16 game. In the final minute of the half it was senior Jake Shoff that brought BYU to within six at 26-20 going into the break by connecting on two free throws and a tip-in with two seconds to go. Coming out of the break, the Utes pushed their lead to 10 at 39-29, their largest lead of the game. But BYU didn't lay down and the Cougars came roaring back with a 10-2 run, capped by a break-away layup by Hall at the 6:27 mark to tie up the game at 43 all. The Cougars kept a hold of the Utes through the remainder of regulation, allowing the Utes to get up by no more than four points the rest of the way. With time winding down and BYU trailing 52-48, Araujo stepped up and knocked down a three-pointer from the left side with 39 seconds to play, bringing the Cougars to within one at 52-51. But with 7.7 seconds on the clock and four seconds on the shot clock, Cougar guard Kevin Woodberry was called for a foul. The foul reset the shot clock and Araujo picked up his fifth foul trying to stop the clock on the inbound play. The Utes went on to win the barnburner 54-51 as Hall's last-second three-point attempt just fell short of the hole and bounced off the front of the rim as time ran out. BYU will now wait to hear from the NCAA Selection Committee as to whether it will be invited to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nGAME 28 RECAP -- COUGARS HOLDS OFF COWBOYS TO ADVANCE TO MWC SEMIFINALS\n\nDENVER -- BYU got one step closer to the Mountain West Conference title with a 79-75 win over the No. 7 seed Wyoming Cowboys in only the second postseason meeting between the two teams. With the victory the Cougars' improve to 4-1 in MWC Quarterfinal games, extend their current winning streak to nine straight games and also get one step closer to ensuring themselves a bid into the NCAA Tournament. \"It was another great college game,\" said BYU head coach Steve Cleveland. \"I think we can make a really good case that we belong (in the NCAA Tournament) but the best way to make that case is just to keep winning.\" And winning is what BYU has done, improving their overall record to 21-7, while the Cowboys finish their season at 11-17 overall. \"There were several people for us that stepped up, probably none bigger than Luiz in making some big baskets,\" said Cleveland. Leading the Cougars in scoring was senior point guard Luiz Lemes, who turned in a team-high 18 points and three assists in 37 minutes of play. Other Cougars who stepped up were seniors Rafael Araujo and Mark Bigelow along with junior Mike Hall who had great performances with all three Cougars scoring in double-digits in the afternoon game. Both Bigelow and Hall had 13 points while Araujo recorded his 15th double-double of the season with 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting and 14 boards, his second highest rebound total of the season and second highest in MWC Tournament history and most ever by a senior. In the first half, the Cougars fell behind 6-7 but it didn't last long as the Cougars mounted a 12-3 run to pull ahead of the Cowboys for the rest of the game. Araujo, Bigelow and Shoff each chipped in eight points in the half for BYU, teaming up for 24 of the Cougars' 32 points. The highlight of the half came as Araujo blocked a Wyoming shot, gathered the ball, passed it out to senior guard Kevin Woodberry who found Bigelow streaking down the sideline and hit him with an outlet pass for a wide open two-handed jam that brought the Cougar fans to their feet. Shoff then reeled off six straight points for the Cougars to go up 26-18 with under five minutes left in the half. BYU went on to close out the half with a pair of free throws by junior forward Jared Jensen, up 32-27 going into the break. The Cougars came out strong in the early going of the second half, putting up five unanswered points to go up by 10. Wyoming answered back with a 6-0 run of their own, including back-to-back steals and layups by David Adams to pull within four at 39-35. BYU fought to get some breathing room, pushing its lead to 12, the largest of the game, at 52-40 behind three-point baskets by Lemes and Hall. With 6:13 left in the game, senior forward Jake Shoff and Wyoming's David Rottinghaus were called for a double foul as the two fell to the floor away from the ball. The foul sent Shoff to the bench with his fifth foul. Wyoming instituted a full-court press through most of the half in an effort to force the Cougars to turn the ball over, but BYU was able to beat the press each time. \"It was hard because we've never had that before,\" said Lemes, \"There were 6-foot-9, 6-foot-10 guys against me, a 6-foot-3 guard. That was pretty tough but our guys did a good job against the press.\" The Cowboys managed to chip away at the Cougars' lead through the next five minutes, closing the margin to four points with less than two minutes to go in the game at 70-66. Free throws became key for the Cougars' down the stretch as the Cougars hit 7-of-8 shots from the line in the closing minute where they did not score a field goal. With less than 20 seconds to play, it was Woodberry's defensive play on Wyoming's Jay Straight that sealed the victory as Woodberry blocked Straight's three-point attempt, grabbed the ball and dribbled out the clock for the 79-75 win.\n\nMWC TOURNAMENT TITLE GOES THROUGH BYU\n\nBYU is one of five different MWC teams to win the MWC Tournament in the first five years of the league championship event. The Cougars won the MWC Tournament title in 2001. The other four seasons the Cougars lost in the tournament to the eventual champion. BYU lost in the finals to home-team UNLV in 2000 and were defeated by San Diego State in the 2002 quarterfinals, lost in overtime to CSU in the 2003 seminfinals and lost in the final seconds this year to Utah in the seminfinals.\n\nARAUJO NAMED TO ALL-TOURNAMENT TEAM\n\nRafael Araujo was named to the Mountain West Conference Mens' Basketball Championship All-Tournament team after averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds in two games last week at the Pepsi Center in Denver. He shot 60 percent from the floor, hit his only three attempt, and made 71 percent of his free throw attempts.\n\nARAUJO RECORDS MWC REBOUNDING MARK\n\nRafael Araujo's 14 rebounds vs. Wyoming in the MWC Tournament quarterfinals is the most ever in the MWC Tournament by a senior and tied for second-highest rebound total by any player, joining former Wyoming star Josh Davis who had 14 boards vs. San Diego State in the 2001 tournament.\n\nDOUBLE-DOUBLE GAMES UP TO 15 FOR ARAUJO\n\nRafael Araujo scored 17 points and added 14 rebounds vs. Wyoming in the MWC Tournament quarterfinals to record his 15th double-double game of the season. Araujo is one of the country's most productive players. He ranks fourth nationally for the highest combined points and rebounds averages. He leads BYU at 18.2 ppg and 10.0 rpg.\n\nBYU MOST DOUBLE-DOUBLES\n\nIN A SINGLE SEASON\n\n22John Fairchild64-65\n\n21Brett Applegate83-84\n\n20Kresimir Cosic71-72\n\n18Steve Trumbo81-82\n\n16John Fairchild63-64\n\n16Russell Larson93-94\n\n15Kresimir Cosic70-71\n\n15Rafael Araujo03-04\n\nBIGELOW APPROACHES MILESTONE ONLY DANNY AINGE HAS ACHIEVED\n\nMark Bigelow needs 14 points to reach 400 points this year. If he reaches that mark, he will become only the second player ever at BYU to score at least 400 points all four seasons. The only Cougar to accomplish that feat in BYU's 102-year basketball history is Danny Ainge. The Cougar All-American scored 500 points every year but his sophomore season, when he scored 498 points.\n\nSTARTS\n\nMark Bigelow will start his 119th game for BYU when the Cougars face Syracuse in the NCAA Tournament, equaling the career starts of former Cougar great Fred Roberts. Only three Cougars have more starts: Jeff Chatman and Randy Reid (122) and Ken Roberts (121). Bigelow will also make his 118th consecutive start, good for third on BYU's all-time list behind Chatman (122) and Fred Roberts (119).\n\nARAUJO ONE OF 30 COUGARS TO SCORE 500 POINTS IN A SEASON\n\nRafael Araujo scored his 500th point of the season with his first bucket vs. Wyoming in last week's MWC quarterfinals. He is the 30th Cougar to reach 500 points in a year and the 42nd occasion when a BYU player has scored 500 points in a season.\n\nWINNING STREAK\n\nBYU won a season-best nine straight games before its MWC Tournament semifinal loss to Utah in its last outing. The nine-game win streak is the team's longest since the 1992-93 season when BYU won 13 in a row. BYU's eight straight wins to conclude the regular season this year is the longest for the Cougars during regular-season MWC play under Steve Cleveland. BYU's victory string was tied for the seventh-longest active streaks in NCAA Division I. BYU still maintains an 18-game homecourt winning streak, which is currently tied for the sixth longest nationally.\n\nRPI RANKINGS\n\nAs of Monday, BYU is the top-rated MWC team in RPI according to Collegiate Basketball News and CollegeRPI.com. BYU is 31st in both ratings. BYU has played the toughest schedule among MWC teams, rated No. 35 (CBN) and No. 37 (CollegeRPI). The MWC is rated seventh as a league by CBN.\n\nMWC ANNOUNCES ALL-CONFERENCE TEAMS AND POSTSEASON AWARDS\n\nTHREE COUGARS HONORED -- ARAUJO NAMED CO-PLAYER OF THE YEAR, HALL EARNS DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Mountain West Conference announced its 2003-04 men's basketball awards Monday. The league's eight men's head coaches along with a selected media panel picked the all-conference teams, as well as the coach, player, freshman and defensive awards.\n\nRafael Araujo of BYU and Nick Welch of Air Force were selected as Co-Players of the Year, marking the first time in the five-year history of the league two players share the top individual honor. Air Force head coach Joe Scott captured Coach of the Year honors, while BYU's Mike Hall was named Defensive Player of the Year, and Freshman of the Year honors went to Andrew Bogut of Utah.\n\nRegular-season champion Air Force, along with second-place BYU and fourth-place UNLV led the league with three all-conference selections each. Utah also had multiple players chosen with two, while Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State and Wyoming each had one. For the first time, the conference did not have any consensus first-team selections or individual awards winners. All eight institutions were represented on the three all-conference teams for the second straight season. Four players were repeat all-conference selections. Second-team honoree Mark Bigelow of BYU was a third-team pick last year, while first-teamer Nick Jacobson of Utah was a two-time third-team selection prior to this season. Air Force's Tim Keller and Colorado State's Matt Nelson are repeat third-team selections from 2002-03.\n\nARAUJO NAMED CO-PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nAraujo is ranked among the top five players in five MWC statistical categories and rates in the top-10 in seven. The senior center from Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an NABC District 13 First Team selection and leads the league in steals (1.93), is fifth in scoring (16.2) and tied for third in rebounds (9.3). In all games, Araujo ranks second in the league in scoring at 18.4 points per clip and is tied for second in rebounding (10.0 rpg). He earned player of the week honors three times during the season and also earned national honors from The Sporting News and Collegeinsider.com. As the Cougars leader in scoring, rebounds, steals and blocks, Araujo led the team in scoring in seven conference games and in rebounds nine times. He recorded four double-doubles in league play and 15 overall. A Wooden Award Midseason Top 30 selection, Araujo became the second Cougar to capture MWC Player of the Year honors joining Mekeli Wesley (2000-01).\n\nHALL EARNS DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nHall, who transferred from Dixie State college last year, ranked second in the league in steals with 25 (1.79 per game). The junior guard led BYU in steals in six games and had the most blocks on four occasions. Throughout the year, Hall received assignments to defend every position but point guard while helping the Cougars to a 10-4 league record. In BYU's win over Utah that secured the No. 2 seed for the Cougars, Hall defended one of the league's top shooters in Nick Jacobson. He forced Jacobson into six turnovers and a 5-for-14 shooting night, including 3-of-10 from behind the arc. Hall played solid defense against UNLV's Demetrius Hunter in BYU's win in Provo on Feb. 7, holding the senior guard to five points and one rebound. He cemented the victory by blocking Hunter's attempt at a game-winning trey with just 2.7 seconds remaining and then securing the rebound. After being fouled, he hit both free throws to finish with 16 points and give BYU the 64-61 triumph. His top performance of the year came against New Mexico's versatile power forward Danny Granger in Provo. Granger had dropped 27, including the game-winner, on the Cougars in the first meeting and came into the game averaging 20.8 points and 9.0 rebounds. The defensive switch proved fruitful as Hall held the Lobos' star to just nine points on 3-of-9 shooting and three rebounds. Hall is the second straight Cougar to capture defensive player of the year honors after Travis Hansen shared the award with UNLV's Marcus Banks last year.\n\n20-WIN SEASONS\n\n-- With its win at UNLV to conclude the regular season, BYU achieved its 28th 20-win season. The Cougars have averaged 20 wins every 2.7 years (BYU has played 76 seasons in which it has played at least 20 games in a season).\n\n-- This is BYU coach Steve Cleveland's fourth 20-win season in his seven years in Provo since rebuilding the program from its 1-25 season in 1996-97. Cleveland has the second-highest percentage of 20 win seasons (57%) in BYU history behind Roger Reid (75%). Only three BYU coaches have had more than four seasons of 20 wins:\n\nStan Watts had 6 seasons of 20 wins in 23 years of coaching\n\nRoger Reid had 6 seasons of 20 wins in 8 years of coaching\n\nG.Ott Romney had 5 seasons of 20 wins in 9 years of coaching\n\nFINISHING STRONG\n\nThe Cougars went from a tie at the bottom of the MWC standings at 2-4 to second place at 10-4 with eight consecutive wins to end league play. BYU won nine straight prior to its loss to Utah in the MWC Tournament semifinals. The Cougars have traditionally finished strong under Steve Cleveland to earn postseason bids. This is BYU's fifth straight postseason appearance. The Cougars shared the conference regular season title in two of the prior three years and advanced to the finals of the MWC Tournament in two of the five seasons, claiming the championship in 2001.\n\nPLAYER PERFORMANCE NOTABLES\n\nRafael Araujo led BYU with 13 points and 8 rebounds vs. Utah in the MWC semifinals, while Kevin Woodberry dished out a team-high six assists off the bench ...

In his college debut, the true freshman guard out of Houston set a new BYU single-game record with eight 3-pointers while scoring a game-high 26 points to lead the Cougars to an 88-54 win over Southern Utah University. His 26 points is the most scored by a BYU freshman since Mark Bigelow totaled 33 points at Washington State in 1998. Rose's eight 3-pointers broke the BYU record of seven threes in a game, previously set by Nick Sanderson (1992) and Danny Bower (1998).

The true freshman got off the bench early against CSU in Provo and sparked BYU's decisive first-half run. He logged 11 minutes in the first half, scoring 10 points, and got the crowd in a frenzy hitting 3-of-4 long-range bombs. He played a season-high 23 minutes for the night. It was his second game of more than 20 minutes (other was 22 minutes in season opener when he scored 26 points and hit a BYU record 8 threes).

This year Roberts was averaging 1.6 points and 1.4 rebounds in 8.6 minutes while playing in five of six games.
