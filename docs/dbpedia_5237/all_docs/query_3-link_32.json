        "text": "CHICAGO, ILL | U.S Futsal National Team head coach Dusan Jakica has announced the 14-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2021 Concacaf Futsal Championship from May 3-9 in Guatemala.\n\nFormer Rutgers University-Newark standout, Raphael Araujo was named to the 14-man roster that will travel to Guatemala. Araujo played for the Scarlet Raiders in 2013 and 2014 after transferring from New Jersey City University where he played two years (2011-12).\n\nIn his two seasons with the Scarlet Raiders, he became the first All-American in Rutgers-Newark history and earned NJAC Co-Offensive Player of the Year honors. He scored 46 goals in just two seasons and finished second in career points with 102. His first season with the Scarlet Raiders was his most prolific as he led the team with 27 goals and 6 assists, good for 60 points on the year.\n\n\"We are very proud of Raphael being named to the US National Futsal Team,\" said head coach Kevin East. \"It is the pinnacle and dream of every soccer player to represent their country in an official international competition. The fact that he made the team is a testament to his talent and drive as a competitor.\"\n\nEast went on to say, \"the first thing that stood out to me about Raphael as a player, besides his natural talent, was how accurate his shots were. A lot of forwards maybe put half their shots on goal. Whether we did a shooting drill or played a scrimmage in training, Raphael would put 9 out of 10 shots on frame. It was very impressive. You knew he was going to test the GK. Raphael is driven to succeed. He plays with a chip on his shoulder and doesn't care who the opponent is. Sometimes forwards will be easy to fall down from defenders challenges and try to draw a foul. Raphael was the exact opposite. He had fire in his eyes and defenders knew they were in for a long day because he would give as much as he took from them.\"\n\n\"Raphael was a rare combination of talent, speed, strength, soccer savvy and attitude. I am really looking forward to watching him play in the World Cup qualifying tournament. I hope they qualify for the World Cup which would be an amazing experience for him,\" said East.\n\nUSA will face El Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba in Group D play at the 13-team tournament. After round-robin group play, the top two teams from each of the four groups will advance to the quarterfinals. The four semifinalists will earn a berth at the 2021 FIFA Futsal World Cup in Lithuania this September (rescheduled from 2020)."
