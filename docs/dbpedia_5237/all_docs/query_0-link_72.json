As a Club, we are extremely appreciative of how hard each of these players have worked on and off the field to achieve this significant milestone. Many of these players have been with Sporting Nebraska FC since its inception and we canâ€™t thank them enough for their dedication and loyalty. As each player begins this new chapter of their lives, we know that the character they have developed while at Sporting NE will carry them through life on and off the field. Although we are sad to see them go, we are excited for their future! Good luck!\n\nOn behalf of the entire Sporting NE staff we would like to congratulate all our players who have chosen to go and play soccer at college. We understand the personal choice every player has made and support them as they leave Sporting NE and embark on a new exciting future. Our goal is to guide our players through their process but to never over step the privacy of each families personal choice."
