Aid funds donated by federal state, institutional organization and private entities are funneled to scholarships and grants with criteria for selection set by the donors. Scholarships are grouped into the Scholarship by Category, AWC Foundation Scholarships, and AWC Institutional Scholarships. Grants are need-based aid like the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and the Arizona State Grants. The office highly recommends students to exhaust all scholarship and grant opportunities before attempting a third choice. The loan aid option, although offered at a relatively low interest rate still needs repayment."
