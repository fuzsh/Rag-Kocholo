        "text": "Eric’s article, where he and his co-authors analyzed whether beehives face predation threats from more than one hornet colony (Vespa velutina nigrithorax), using both hydrocarbons and microsatellites, can be found here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nED: I am an associate professor at the University of Tours, where I serve as director of the Agrosciences Department (one of the university’s teaching departments). I am also a researcher at the Research Institute for Insect Biology (IRBI; UMR CNRS 7261). I mainly study chemical communication in eusocial insects, such as hornets, termites, bees, and ants.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nED: Early on, I studied reproductive mechanisms in parasitoid wasps and quickly moved into analysing the chemical cues that females use to maximise reproduction. Within a few years, I became interested in eusocial insects, given that chemical communication is probably the most important structuring force in their societies. My initial work was with termites (Reticulitermes species). In 2007, I got interested in an invasive eusocial insect that had arrived in France just 3 years prior: the Asian hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax).\n\nI was convinced that studying chemical communication (e.g., chemical signatures composed of cuticular hydrocarbons, alarm pheromones, sex pheromones) could help develop targeted and efficient systems for controlling this invasive species. Moreover, as very little was known about this hornet, it was possible to answer numerous biological and ecological questions about it and other hornet species.\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nED: Hornet species, of course! In all seriousness, every social insect taxon is exciting to research. There are so many topics to study in insect societies, like nest architecture, communication systems, social structure, and how females become queens, just to name a few examples. At present, I am very interested in hornet species. This group was relatively little studied in the past, and so many scientific questions remain to be explored.\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nED: That is a difficult question. However, when I discovered a parasite (Conops vesicularis) that could kill Vespa velutina foundresses (Darrouzet et al, 2015), that was a great moment. It happened like this: I was dissecting queens to show a colleague what their reproductive tracts look like. I was quite puzzled to observe a white mass in one of their abdomens because it was the first time I had observed such a structure. It turns out that it was a parasite! We demonstrated that this local species, a parasitoid fly, can parasitise and kill Asian hornet foundresses as colonies are getting started.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nED: I regularly do outreach to share information about social insects, their nests, and the invasive hornet V. velutina (its biology and ecology; its impacts on biodiversity, our economy, and our health; and potential control strategies). My most common audiences are students, beekeepers, everyday citizens, and journalists. Sometimes I will draw on my own work to develop points made during these outreach efforts.\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nED: In science, all questions are important and interesting. Because it is my field of specialty, I think it is essential to analyse communication systems in social insects. Communication is the link among all the individuals making up a group, such as a colony. Sociality can only exist because those individuals are communicating.\n\nMoreover, by analysing communication systems, we can come up with better ways for controlling insect pests, including invasive species. For example, we can develop specific baits to improve trapping systems, synthetic pheromones to disrupt reproduction, or repulsive compounds to drive away specific species, like agricultural pests. Gathering knowledge about insect chemical communication is crucial to this work.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nED: What a difficult question! Whatever the scientific domain, you wll find debates around specific questions. Inf I focus on my area of expertise – chemical communication in insects – I question the function of every chemical compound in a pheromone blend. Is it that each compound possesses a specific function or that a mixture containing a particular relative quantity of these compounds givesrise to a function? One challenge is also linked to our technical capacity to identify all the compounds present. Maybe compounds present at low levels could have an active role in the pheromone blend. However, when we are cmparing blends among individuals, it is difficult (or impossible) to analyse all the compounds present. So, in general, we focus on the main compounds so that we can obtain several fundamental pieces of information. That said, we are left wondering what insects are actually perceiving. Is it the main compounds in the pheromone blend, or all of the compounds in the blend, including those present at very low levels? It is a difficult but interesting question! I think that if there are so many compounds present, each compound must have a function. But what function is that? The question remains open.\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nED: The last book I read was written by a colleague at my university: Le bateau de Palmyre, quand les mondes anciens se rencontraient (The Palmyre boat, when ancient civilizations met”) (Éditions Tallandier). The author, Maurice Sartre, presents what we know about travel and exploration by ancient civilizations. He shows that global trade existed thousands of years before modern times…and that humans probably faced the same problems as we do today with regards to invasive species.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nED: I am fascinated by ancient civilizations. I have read books about Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, for example. It is amazing to see what these peoples built, how they lived, and what their cultures were like.\n\nSince I study V. velutina, I am in contact with several beekeepers, and some have become friends. Consequently, I was inspired by them to try beekeeping myself! I have my own apiary, which I got started one year ago. It is extremely interesting. I spend a lot of time observing the workers’ activities and managing my colonies. Producing my “own” honey is also fantastic! What’s more, I now have my own experimental site, right there in my garden, where I can test traps targeting V. velutina, which preys on bees.\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nED: Doing scientific research is always difficult. We have to keep at it, trying things again and again. I remember my PhD advisor telling me that research is 90% failure and 10% success. So, challenges are a normal part of the job.\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nED: First, I would like to bring my family. My wife and children are what is most important in my life. The second would be books. I have so many books at home, and knowledge is extremely important to me. Therefore, I would bring scientific books, technical books (we would need to figure out how to survive on that island!), and literature.\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nED: A scientific career is influenced by so many people and colleagues. Choosing a single person is really hard. My high school biology teacher had the earliest influence on me, and she is the reason that I studied biology in college. Next, I would probably say my PhD advisor, who taught me how to be a scientist, how to think, how to implement scientific protocols, and how to rigorously approach scientific results, among other things.\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nED: It is hard to become a scientific researcher these days. If speaking to a motivated student, I would say: choose and work with a good scientific lab and team during your PhD. This team should be publishing regularly. You need to learn different techniques and publish several articles to have a chance at obtaining a position. However, the best advice I could give to young people is to listen to themselves: think hard about how you feel about your potential dissertation topic, research lab and team, and, most of all, PhD advisor. You are committing to 3 years of work!\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nED: Thanks to my job, I have had the opportunity to travel to different countries. For example, I was lucky enough to go to China twice for a scientific collaboration. My collaborators and I conducted research on the viruses exchanged between honey bees and hornets. It was a fantastic project. Thanks to my Chinese colleague, Dr Chunsheng Hou, I learned about apiaries in China, different hornet species, how some companies rear hornets, and practical applications involving hornets (e.g., food, traditional medicine, pest control). Scientifically, it was very thrilling. Moreover, I was able to make one of my dreams come true: I took a walk along the Great Wall!\n\nClea’s article, where she and her co-authors Érica Araújo, Jacques Delabie reviewed current definitions of somatic developmental anomalies in ants and propose a simplified classification system, can be found here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nI am Brazilian and live in the state of Bahia, in the Brazilian northeast. My background is in entomology, focusing on the diversity and development of ants through the prism of cytogenetics. Recently, I have also studied the diversity of commensals that live in and around ant colonies. I teach zoology at one of the state universities of Bahia, UESC, at Ilhéus.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nDuring my undergraduate course, I had a professor with excellent training in entomology, the late Max de Menezes. He opened my eyes to the interest in working with insects, but it was through the opportunity to go to the field to help a good friend (Riviane Bellenand) to collect ant nests (Ectatomma tuberculatum) that I discovered what I really wanted to do. It was also around that time that I started to become interested in the morphology of ants as I observed rare malformed individuals with genetic or developmental abnormalities in the laboratory. I found this fascinating and ever since then, I have been accumulating information and material on these aspects.\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nI am fascinated by ants in general, mainly because of their diversity of life habits. What I find most exciting about these organisms is that, despite being recognized as being so organized with long-awaited life patterns, there is always a species that breaks the rules, that doesn’t follow the pre-defined models. However, the ants I am more in love with are the Ponerinae of the genus Neoponera. They preferentially live in forests or agroforests, where they are rather diverse because some species can live on the ground and others on the trees, and they offer a great variation in size, behavior and use of resources. These ants are fantastic animals!\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nWhen I began to study the chromosomes of Ponerinae ants, karyotypes allowed me to establish well-defined groups of species not only from their chromosome characters, but also from other reasons, such as morphology and strata explored in their environment. For me, it was more evidence that cytogenetics had a great potential for studying biological diversity. Currently, we see everywhere that studies on cryptic species or integrative taxonomy and cytogenetics are a tool which allows exploring that.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nIn the undergraduate course where I am teaching, I include scientifically dissemination content of the topics studied (invertebrate zoology and social insect biology), to show to students how to bring scientific content closer to the non-academic community. In the postgraduate program in zoology, to which I am linked, we have two disciplines related to scientific dissemination with the aim not only to publicize the research work carried out, but also to prepare students in the production of this kind of material (with the theme of their own projects) in order to reach the non-academic public.\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nI think it is essential that social insect scholars know the processes of evolution and maintenance of sociality, since these aspects modulate important characters of social groups. Access to this knowledge does not always imply the use of methods that include technological innovation. Natural history studies allow not only the interpretation of the mechanisms that maintain sociality, but also open doors to investigations not yet carried out. I make this observation especially in the scenario in which I am inserted: in a country and region with an exceptional biodiversity, but with a limited access to financial resources destined for so-called “basic” research. I have the privilege of being allowed to carry out experiments and observations within the grounds of my own institution (UESC) but also in the experimental areas of a close partner (Laboratory of Myrmecology at Centro de Pesquisas do Cacau CEPEC/CEPLAC), both within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. This region has still an incredible potential to be explored for further studies on social insects, which sometimes compensates for the lack of resources in research investment.\n\nI believe that integrative studies are fundamental for the future of research on social insects, i.e. putting together two or more of these disciplines: taxonomy, morphology and anatomy, genetics, behavior, biogeography, community ecology (mutualism, commensalism, competition, etc.). Also all the topics traditionally considered “natural history” are important and cannot be forgotten.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nI am especially interested in the nature of interactions between social insects and the organisms associated with them, whether in their nests or inside their own body: how these relationships are established, what are the recognition mechanisms that “allow” the entry and fixing of these organisms to the social organisms (for ants, see the paper of von Beeren et al., 2021, Frontiers in Zoology https://doi.org/10.1186/s12983-021-00427-8).\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nAs a scientific book, the last book that I read was the biography of Alexandre Yersin (Peste et Choléra, Patrick Deville, Femina Literary Prize in France in 2012). I strongly recommend it not only for the exceptional life of this scientist but mainly because this text is an ode to perseverance, which may be one of the first qualities of a researcher.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nCooking and reading. I also love going to the beach. The entire coastline of Bahia is wonderful.\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nI remember hard times I have gone through, I think of other people who had fewer opportunities or who went through bigger problems than mine, I breathe and try to move on (sometimes this can take a few days).\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nA pad of paper, a box of pencils – to write, talk to myself and plan for the future. And a blanket, to feel myself welcomed.\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nI would be unfair if I didn’t name the three people who have influenced me the most in my career:\n\nJacques Delabie is an example of the generosity of a person who, in a conversation, can lead you to think of a thousand projects, who strives that each one he works with grows, offers opportunities for everyone to succeed. He always encouraged me, during our conversations and our coexistence.\n\nMy graduate advisor, Dr. Silvia Pompolo, who is an exigent (in the good sense) professional and is for me the personification of the necessary care for research work, the exact application of laboratory protocols; always fair and interested in everything new in social Hymenoptera cytogenetics.\n\nFinally, I cannot forget Professor Lucio Campos, who managed (before he retired) to stimulate any student’s interest in social insects, simply by talking during a walk from the university to the city center.\n\nAll of them I consider influential for me not only because they supported and guided me in the beginning of my research, but also because of the example of human resources trainers that they are.\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nDo not make a prejudgment, open your eyes, don’t get stuck in a bubble, however good your research proposal may seem.\n\n“Innovation” research currently represents progress, but there is still much that can be studied in social insects.\n\nBe curious, read a lot and observe even more; for each question you have already answered continue with “what if…?”\n\nListen to the more experienced, but also ask your own questions and hypothesize.\n\nWork as a team; follow the example of social insects.\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nTropical forests are my favorite places, especially the Amazon. The strength and, at the same time, the fragility of this type of environment are impressive. Just thinking that the answers to so many questions about the diversity of life are in front of us and we can help to understand and that we can lose so much richness in a few generations leaves me astonished…\n\nMarina’s article (together with Lori Lach), where they explored that the novel host to Nosema ceranae, Apis mellifera is less likely to detect the parasite than its original host, the asian honeybee A. cerana, can be found here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nMC: My name is Marina Choppin, I am 26 years old and was born in France. I did my bachelor’s degree in biology in Bordeaux and my master’s degree both in Tours and Cairns in Australia. I am currently based in Mainz and have just defende my PhD in May! During my PhD I investigated the mechanisms that underlie longevity and fecundity in ants and I have worked with bees and termites before. So my focus is on social insects and I am interested in questions related to evolution, using tools like behavioral observations, experimental manipulations, and bioinformatics.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nMC: I grew up close to nature in Corsica where the biodiversity is mind-blowing and I always had a particular interest in insects. They are everywhere and paying attention to them is like diving into a whole new world! Later on, I started my master’s degree in Tours which had a strong focus on insect biology and I got to learn about social insects, which were so intriguing to me. So I studied termites at the IRBI (Research Institute for the Biology of Insect) in Tours with Dr. Christophe Lucas during a 2-month project and got hooked!\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nMC: I would say the soldier caste of turtle ants because they represent evolution at its finest. Their head is shaped in a way that allows them to block the entrance of their nest, which is amazing. And they are cute too!\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nMC: Probably the first time I published as a first author because this manuscript was not necessarily planned as a part of my PhD project. We collected the ants for my PhD in the US in Arizona and when we got back to the lab I measured all the queens from all the nests, over 2000 individuals, because the ant species I studied has two queen morphs that differ in size so I needed to assign my queens to one or the other morph. But after analyzing the data set out of curiosity, we found an interesting pattern: an influence of colony composition on queen body size depending on their morph. So we also measured workers, did behavioral experiments, chemical assays, and demographic analyses to further investigate the relationships between queen and worker traits, colony composition, and environment and we ended up writing a nice story that we published in Myrmecological News. It was great to build on an unexpected finding because it was different from the usual experiment planning which is way more thought-through of course.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nMC: Not actively, no. I have helped with practical courses during my PhD which was nice because I love statistics and I tried to make it more enjoyable for students as well. And I recently created a Twitter account to share my research but it isn’t very intuitive for me for some reason. But I do love talking about my research with friends or people I meet during my travels because they are always super intrigued and come up with non-expert questions that can catch you off guard and make you think deeper about your work!\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nMC: I am a bit biased of course but there are still many interesting questions to investigate when it comes to social insect aging. Trying to understand how social insect queens can achieve extraordinarily long lifespans while remaining highly fecund is still a mystery, although more and more studies add to our knowledge on the topic! I also think that with the cutting-edge molecular protocols and associated bioinformatic tools that are currently being developed and applied to social insect research we will be able to get deeper insights into this mystery in the coming years. The field of epigenetics is also essential to navigate and promising because phenotypic plasticity is a pillar of social insect societies.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nMC: I feel like in general different scientists have different opinions on the same topics, regardless of what the topic is. Which makes science interesting and stimulating. But I know for example that the functional relevance of DNA methylation in social insect genome is still actively debated! And once again the newest chromatin profiling techniques might provide answers to this question.\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nMC: I recently read “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle. We know that living in the present is important but it is so difficult to do. Humans, and me the first, tend to seek reassurance in the past through memories that give us a sense of identity or to anticipate and overthink the future because it is a source of uncertainties. I would recommend this book to people that are interested in trying to make their human experience more enjoyable and less worrisome. Although the author sometimes places himself in a “know-it-all” position that I find annoying and unnecessary. We are all here to learn after all.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nMC: Talking about books, I do like to read and I listen to podcasts pretty much on a daily basis. I like to learn about different topics outside of biology like health, nutrition or psychology. I also like to write and I have been doing it since I was a kid, I started writing a book that I put aside when writing my PhD thesis and I’m looking forward to getting back to it! I also travel as much as possible, by myself as well because it makes it a completely different experience. I also enjoy working out, doing yoga, and meditating. I love the outdoors and find nature very therapeutic so I try to walk around and hike in my free time and do horseback riding when I get the chance. And because life is all about balance, I also enjoy going out for drinks with my friends!\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nMC: I appreciate this question because mental health is such an important topic that is sometimes overlooked in academia. When things get tough I try to do extra self-care, be less strict with myself in terms of productivity and routine, and most importantly I try to remind myself that this is temporary. Nothing lasts forever, bad times included!\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nMC: I think answering this question requires thinking about two things: the survival aspect and the psychological aspect, in terms of loneliness. For my survival, very cliché answer but I would bring a knife. For my mental health, I would bring a notebook and a pen (hopefully it counts as one item, otherwise I would only take the pen!) and finally, I would bring this big scarf I have which I brought on all my travels, camping trips, and festival. I would use it as a blanket at night and to protect my head from the sun during the day!\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nMC: Dr. Romain Libbrecht for sure. He is one of the group leaders in Mainz and he was my PhD mentor. I find him brilliant as a scientist and amazing as a human. He is particularly skilled when it comes to statistics and it was always extremely rewarding and enjoyable to brainstorm with him on the best way to analyze challenging data sets. I learned a lot from him and I am really grateful for his help. He also made me feel more confident in my vision of science, which is all about rigor, quality, and critical thinking, because I believe that we share these values.\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nMC: Maybe to keep an open mind because these little creatures do not operate like most living organisms! And to avoid anthropomorphism. It is too easy to draw parallels between ant and human societies for example, but it won’t necessarily benefit your research. At least in my opinion!\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nMC: The Chiricahua mountains in Arizona where we collected the ants for my project. We stayed at the SWRS (South Western Research Station) and this was one of the most amazing places I have experienced. We ran into amazing wildlife all the time, like hummingbirds, bobcats, rattlesnakes, tarantulas, or coatis. The landscapes were stunning and it was simply amazing to share a beer in the evening, under the stars, with other students and researchers from all over the world that gathered in this remote area because of their common interest in nature basically.\n\nThe first scientific work coming out from the ‘Ants of Brazil’ initiative was recently published in Insectes Sociaux (‘Ant diversity studies in Brazil: an overview of the myrmecological research in a megadiverse country’) here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nAnts of Brazil – AB: We are a workgroup of 38 Brazilian ant researchers that aim to provide a base line for the improvement of Brazilian myrmecological studies for the international scientific community. The head team is made up by Fernando Schmidt, Carla Ribas and Rodrigo Feitosa, who have been good friends since 2005 and currently have professorship positions at Federal University of Acre (in Northern Brazil), Federal University of Lavras (in South-eastern Brazil) and Federal University of Paraná (in Southern Brazil), respectively. In 2012, inspired by several international initiatives in Myrmecology, we created the Ant of Brazil workgroup that has three basic action lines: teaching, research, and science communication, by disseminating knowledge on ant diversity and related studies.\n\nRegarding the teaching line, we have offered 8 day-courses every two years on ant systematics, taxonomy and ecology which always take place in one of the six Brazilian official biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal). In the research line, we have a big data base on published ant diversity papers with the aim to provide scientometric and conceptual synthesis and meta-analyses on diversity patterns of ants in the Brazilian territory, of which our paper Schmidt et al. (2022) in Insectes Sociaux is the first one published. Finally, as an initiative in science communication, we support a group in Facebook (Formigas do Brasil) where ant people can disseminate their projects and papers, ask help for ant identification and material processing. Currently, the group has more than 1,500 members.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nAB: We have worked in several comprehensive papers on Brazilian ants by a scientometric approach, such as the profile of ant diversity studies developed in Brazil (Schmidt et al. 2022), the diversity and occurrence of ant taxa in the Brazilian biomes (Feitosa et al. under revision), the use of taxonomic tools to validate ant identification in Brazil (Feitosa et al. under revision) and conceptual synthesis and meta-analyses on diversity patterns of ants in the Brazilian territory, testing the effect of seasonality (Queiroz et al. under revision), soil use, resource and conditions and interactions (manuscripts in preparation).\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nFernando: My primary interest in ants is their use as a model in diversity patterns and bioindication research. However, my favourite genus is Odontomachus.\n\nCarla: Oh! In the beginning I just used ants as a model to do ecology research, but since I discovered more and more about ants, I really love these amazing insects! Now I like them so much, that I marked them on my body for life! I have a tattoo (actually of seven ants!) on my right arm, it is my favourite genus, Cephalotes.\n\nRodrigo: Ants, of course! No social insect group exhibit such a diversity of ecological and behavioral strategies. Not to mention the fantastic morphological diversity. Among ants, my favorite is certainly the genus Daceton from the Amazonian lowlands of South America. Wonderful spiny, arboreal, trap-jaw ants.\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nFernando: It was the publication of the main manuscript of my Doctorate project, which is about ant diversity patterns in tropical rainforest and savannas in Brazil and Indonesia, which besides the nice paper (Schmidt et al. 2017) also allowed me to travel to wonderful tropical places. Additionally, the first paper from our data base published in Insectes Sociaux is also a remarkable match in my career.\n\nCarla: This is a difficult question because I really love my research with ants. Specifically, I like the field samplings a lot, when I can see ants working and it allows me to discover wonderful places in Brazil. During my doctorate I studied the latitudinal gradient of ants, travelling from the North to the South of Brazil. This is really great, to see the ants in all their biomes! I also think that it is amazing to listen to people talking about their popular knowledge about ants. This is, for now, one of the best moments in my career, when I started to exchange knowledge about ants with non-academic people!\n\nRodrigo: Probably the first record of worker transportation performed by queens in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. Fantastic behavior that I observed in the semidecidual forests of central Brazil, published in 2007 in Insectes Sociaux. I also love each record of rarely collected ants during my field trips in the Brazilian forests.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nFernando: I teach and have incorporated the results of my research and ant colleagues in my teaching class. (IS: also, check out Fernando’s instagram: @ecoformiga)\n\nCarla: Yes! I do both! I disseminate my research about ants in the different subjects that I teach, as well as by social media of my lab (instagram: @lef_ufla) and in interviews about the articles, such as this for the Insectes Sociaux blog. More recently, as I already mentioned, I love to exchange knowledge about ants in ethnomyrmecology research and in schools in Lavras.\n\nRodrigo: We do science communication by the social media channel of my lab (instagram: @Feitosalab), where we share the results of our projects and publications in a non-academic language to reach people from all the social classes and backgrounds. We also promote activities involving primary schools in our town, Curitiba.\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nAB: We would like to encourage colleagues to collaborate and form workgroups such as Ants of Brazil in their countries or regions, which can allow a comprehensive view of studies on ant diversity at a global scale. Moreover, in at least one of our papers we also provide examples of inter-institutional workgroups and highlight their importance to improve the sampling cover and knowledge on ant diversity in tropical regions like Brazil. We also should invest additional effort in studies about ant natural history, as this area is the very basis of almost everything we do in myrmecology. Additionally, a rich field of research is ant socio-biodiversity, where we can share knowledge with non-academic partners, learning from them about ants and disseminating our research and knowledge of ants in general.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nAB: Probably the different and sometimes divergent methods to infer evolutionary relationships and diversification rates in most groups of social insects, ants included. In ecology, we think that discovering ecosystem functions that ants perform, functional diversity patterns and how we affect it, becomes a central issue.\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nFernando: ‘Letters to a young scientist’ by Edward O. Wilson. Wilson offers nice advice to not only young scientists, but for scientists of all ages. Wilson brilliantly approaches several stages of the scientific method and scientific life using inspired personal examples. I super recommend this book to everyone who wishes to become a scientist or already is one. Books from Wilson do not need justification, just read them!\n\nCarla: Sapiens – Uma Breve História da Humanidade by Yuval Harari. Besides telling the biological story of Homo sapiens, it also links it to the history of the world. It is fantastic!\n\nRodrigo: O Sábio e a Floresta by Moacir Werneck De Castro. A biography of the German naturalist Fritz Müller (1821-1897) who emigrated to southern Brazil and helped to promote Darwinism based on his observations on the natural history of the organisms that inhabited the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. A must read for every nature lover, biologist or not.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nFernando: I like to play with my children and to work in the garden.\n\nCarla: Meeting with friends for a nice talk and drink beer is very good to free the mind from routine and also helps to have new ideas about ants, when your friends are also ant researchers, like Fernando and Rodrigo! In these (hopefully past) pandemic times, I watched movies and played with my child, besides staying in contact with nature and going on walks, since I used to live in a rural area.\n\nRodrigo: I’m a beer enthusiast! I enjoy both drinking and studying the history of beer and its different styles. I like to fish too!\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nAB: Our last paper published in Insectes Sociux is good example of dedication, persistence and a lot of patience to overcome the direct and indirect drawbacks related to a paper publication such as planning the study aims, sampling/carrying out experiments, data analyses and writing. Besides the difficulties in these common steps of a scientific paper, in our study we also had to deal with the coordination of a big group of people with different expectations and points of view. However, the Brazilian myrmecological community is very friendly and collaborative which was essential to carrying out the work smoothly and patiently along the 10 years spent on the study. Specifically, for us in the head team, parallel to the big job that this paper requested, we also experienced along these 10 years notable marks in our professional and personal lives such as professorship positions, the first student project to supervise, child births, administrative positions, and everything else that takes our time to work on the paper. Thus, besides huge dedication, high levels of persistence and patience were necessary to achieve the final results, which we wish to celebrate in an appropriated way when we meet again.\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nFernando: Essential things to survive: entomological stuff to sample ants, a computer for paper writing and data analyses, food and beer to have meals and fun.\n\nCarla: Beer (relax and fun), books (knowledge and fun) and paper to write down new ideas.\n\nRodrigo: Beer, a fishing rod, and a good book collection.\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nFernando: My advisors and professors and for the papers, mainly the review ones from Alan Andersen, and the seminal paper of Andrés Baselga on beta diversity partitioning, which I have worked on since my doctorate.\n\nCarla: My advisor, José H. Schoereder, who studies ant ecology and gave me inspiration not just as an excellent researcher, but as an incredible human being. My graduate friends for life that also studied ant ecology – Renata Campos and Tathiana Sobrinho, and these two lovely friends that have been sharing amazing experiences and life time with me – Fernando and Rodrigo. But I really think that the influence in my career comes from every partner that I shared knowledge about ants with, from these cited above, my advised students, and non-academic people. All these people together are my influence!\n\nRodrigo: My advisor, Beto Brandão, the incredible ant taxonomist Barry Bolton and, for sure, Edward O. Wilson.\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nAB: Regarding ant diversity and ecology, many patterns have been described and the responses of ant communities to natural or human-induced disturbances are becoming more predictable; however, the mechanisms behind these patterns are still very little investigated. To explore the drivers and processes related to ant assemblage structure, big data bases, such as the one provided by ‘Ants of Brazil‘ and several others, would be essential, with which a lot of elegant studies on the mechanisms behind ant diversity patterns could be done even without additional ant sampling. And do not forget that people are as important as ants in our research! Exchange knowledge with them!\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nFernando: During my doctorate, I had the opportunity to do an internship for one year in Germany in the Agroecology group of Prof. Teja Tscharntke – University of Göttingen. Beside the fruitful scientific time, my wife (who is a scientist too) and I had the opportunity to travel to several countries around the world.\n\nCarla: During my doctorate I travelled from the South to the North of Brazil to sample ants. This was fantastic!\n\nRodrigo: The Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). What a magic ecosystem!\n\nJim’s recent review article on the origin of the worker phenotype in paper wasps can be found here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nJH: My name is Jim Hunt. I was James in public school, but on the way out the door of my last day of high school I became Jim. James was simply too stuffy. At age 77 I’m retired and no longer active in research, but I spent my professorial career in pursuit of the origin of eusociality in paper wasps. There were a few studies of solitary mud daubers and tropical swarm-founding wasps along the way, but I never lost focus on my long-term goal. My research ranged from behavior to molecular biology. The review out in Insectes Sociaux pulls it all together and places it in context as the solution to a quest I began in 1974.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nJH: Edward O. Wilson’s book The Insect Societies appeared in 1971, during the time I was a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley. I read it cover to cover. Twice. My Ph.D. research was on the comparative ecology of ants in Mediterranean climate habitats of southern California and central Chile. My postdoctoral research at Harvard was to be a similarly-structured study of ants in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona and a corresponding hot desert in Catamarca Provence, northwestern Argentina. Between those projects, in the summer of 1973, I attended the First International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado. I listened as Herbert Baker, professor of Botany at Berkeley, presented research that he and his wife, Irene, had pursued on the presence and abundance of free amino acids in floral nectar of different guilds of flower types (hummingbird pollinated, bee pollinated, bat pollinated, etc.). While listening I recalled a photo in Wilson’s book by Ulrich Maschwitz showing an adult Vespula vulgaris, a yellowjacket wasp, drinking saliva from a larva in its nest. As I listened to Baker, I thought it might be interesting to someday use their analytical methods on the larval saliva. Then on a Friday evening in March of 1974, while talking with a non-biologist housemate, I had a bolt-from-the-blue AHA! That’s why they’re social !! – the saliva is nourishment for the adult! I knew in that instant I’d found my passion. At first, I was thinking like an ecologist – a wasp could improve its foraging energy efficiency by combining prey foraging for larvae and nourishment for itself into a single trip. That weekend I wrote a short manuscript describing the idea and on Monday morning discussed it with Wilson, my postdoctoral sponsor. Unbeknownst to me, he was writing Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, in which he placed all of his eggs into an inclusive fitness basket. He vigorously disagreed with my idea. “It isn’t right. It can’t be right. … Even if it’s right, and I’m not saying that it is, no one will believe you until you have years of data to back yourself up.” I left Wilson’s office with my career path laid out in front of me. In August I took a position at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. On my first weekend there, a faculty member took me to one of the University’s field stations. I spotted a large colony of Polistes fuscatus on an abandoned building and moved closer for a better look. One of the wasps greeted me with a sting beneath my right eye, and my love affair with Polistes was underway.\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nJH: Polistes metricus was the most abundant paper wasp at the two field sites where I pursued field studies almost every season of the 33 years I was at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. I put wooden boxes with open bottoms on posts about 1.5 m high that I spaced about 10 m apart in rows in open fields of mixed grasses and forbs. Foundresses established nests beneath the box lids that could be lifted off for easy access. In early years the occupancy rate was 60% or more. Students and I could monitor colony growth, feed individual larvae, feed whole colonies, or remove individual larvae for physiological or gene expression analyses, depending on what that year’s experiment was. They were easy to bring into the lab and rear under controlled conditions. Importantly, P. metricus is a single-foundress species, therefore I avoided multiple foundress colonies and the confusions and misleading pathways that such colonies unavoidably have.\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nJH: During a project in Costa Rica on the paper wasp Mischocyttarus immarginatus, I was collecting larval saliva and encountered a remarkable behavior. I could easily take saliva from larvae in pre-emergence nests with only a foundress present, but in post-emergence nests with multiple workers feeding larvae that would become gynes and males, larvae refused to give me a single drop. Instead, they rolled their heads forward into a pocket on their ventral surface and withdrew it into the nest cell. The resulting turgor pressure caused a rigid pointed lobe to come quickly forward beyond the head. It would have prevented an adult wasp from taking saliva. It also prevented me. It was an unmistakable sign that the saliva was valuable nourishment that the larva retained for its own development. A day or so after returning home I described the remarkable behavior to a senior member of my department and said that its discovery was pure serendipity. He replied, “Ah, but serendipity doesn’t come sit in your lap while you’re lounging behind your desk in your office”.\n\nI subsequently learned that every Mischocyttarus has a similar larval lobe, although its morphology varies among species. In a corresponding behavior, gyne and male larvae of Polistes metricus (and all Polistes?) roll their heads forward and withdraw into the nest cell, causing the ventral surface to become turgid and foremost in the nest cell, blocking access to the mouthparts. It’s easy to feed them but impossible to take saliva from them.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nJH: While at UM-St. Louis I led several workshops for high school biology teachers to introduce them to taking their teaching outdoors. I co-authored a short publication on common wasps and bees for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and did an inventory survey of insect collections in colleges and universities around the state. There were a few TV and newspaper interviews during yellowjacket outbreak years in St. Louis. Lamentably, there was little more than that.\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nJH: Having done my last research in 2015 has left me out of date in areas other than my own, which I follow through published literature and occasional correspondence with colleagues. Anything else I might say would be speculation.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nJH: In my research area, the biggest debate concerns the role of relatedness in “the evolution of eusociality.” In his 2011 book Principles of Social Evolution, Andrew F. G. Bourke lumps me together with E. O. Wilson and others as poor saps who just cannot understand and therefore acknowledge the central role played by inclusive fitness. It was good company to be in. I couldn’t have been prouder. With my paper now having appeared in Insectes Sociaux, it’s game, set and match.\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nJH: Wilmington’s Lie: The Murderous Coup of 1898 and The Rise of White Supremacy by David Zucchino. Winner of the 2021 Pulitzer Prize, it’s a horrific true story of events that took place in Wilmington, North Carolina, during the years following the U.S. Civil War. The centerpiece of the story is the coup d’état of a democratically elected mixed race city government. It was the only coup d’état in US history, but it’s also a story that disappeared almost immediately after it occurred. I grew up in North Carolina and live here now, but I’d never heard of it until about 2 years ago when it was described to me by a high school friend who is an historian.\n\nWilmington was the largest city in North Carolina at the time and had been the last open port of the Confederacy. During Reconstruction after the Civil War, black and white racial mixing was present in Wilmington’s municipal government and police force, the state legislature, and the state’s delegation to the US House of Representatives. Wilmington had a large working class Black population and also a thriving Black middle class. A Black owned and edited daily newspaper served the Black citizens. White merchants advertised in it. At the same time, however, nighttime acts of white terrorism were taking place in rural locations throughout the region.\n\nI attended Josephus Daniels Junior High School in Raleigh, my hometown. Daniels had been Secretary of the Navy during World War I and was later the ambassador to Mexico. I was proud of my school’s namesake. In Zucchino’s book I learned that, in his position as editor and publisher of the state’s largest newspaper, Daniels was also an unabashed racist. With fake news, race baiting, and outrageous editorial agitation, he led the state’s White population to become increasingly fearful of an imaginary Black supremacy. White supremacists in Wilmington gave speeches that enflamed emotions. White citizens of Wilmington purchased thousands of guns.\n\nThe coup d’état occurred two days following a municipal election marked by precinct gerrymandering, extreme voter intimidation of Blacks, and ballot box stuffing by White supremacists. White supremacists’ plans were scarcely concealed, and newspaper reporters from Atlanta to New York were there to record it. On the day of the coup, the office of the Black newspaper was burned and more than 60 black men were murdered. Blacks fearful for their lives fled into the woods and swamps. Members of the mixed-race board of aldermen were forced to resign, marched to the train station, and told to never return.\n\nBlacks who had fled the city were urged to return – as long as they stayed “in their place.” The coup d’état marked the beginning of the southern apartheid – Jim Crow. Although lengthy, the book tells the heretofore untold tale of one of the most significant milestones in US history. It should be required reading for anyone interested in US history – or, especially, anyone seeking insight into the political and social climate of the USA today. I highly recommend it.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nJH: In the summer I was 8, my dad was enrolled in grad school at the University of Maryland. He bought me a beginner’s stamp collecting kit to keep me busy while we were there, and almost immediately I was hooked. I continued to fill spaces in albums until the end of high school, but then things went dormant. In the early ‘90s the collecting bug, soon an obsession, came roaring back. Filling album spaces gave way to preparing exhibits for competitions at stamp shows around the country. They’re like all-breeds dog shows – no two exhibits are on the same topic. I now show the world’s best collection of the revenue stamps of Boliva (yawn), revenue stamps of Chile used to pay postage (yawn), and the provisional stamps of Arequipa, Peru, from 1880 to 1886. That one has an historical context and is actually somewhat interesting for non-collectors. I’ll continue to target my collecting for new exhibits until I no longer am able.\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nJH: My partner (“wife”) and I (“husband”) will soon celebrate our seventh anniversary. We’ve traveled to faraway places for a month at a time, including three trips to Latvia, where she was born. With the pandemic here, we’re no longer able to travel internationally. Instead, we’ve begun exploring North Carolina via week-long stays at lovely B&Bs. Our house is on a steep hillside in the woods. When looking out the front picture windows, we’re living in a treehouse in the forest canopy. We try to make every day we’re home rich and enjoyable. My tough times are behind me. Life is good.\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nJH: My trifocals, so that I can see; a hat to protect my baldpate from sunburn; and the retainer that I wear at night to keep my lower teeth from migrating into misalignment. If those are presumed to be givens, then my three things would be a room-size tent in which I can stand up – I’ve done more than enough crawling into camping tents in my life; a machete – a marvelous multi-function tool; and a solar powered 3D printer to make trinkets for barter with the hordes of tourists that will inevitably flock to visit a previously uninhabited island.\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nJH: When one has reached my age there has been abundant time for many people to have influenced a career. Those whom I acknowledge here are not the only ones, but their influence has been significant at steps along my way.\n\nThomas L. Quay, the father of my best friend in elementary and junior high school, was a professor and ornithologist at North Carolina State University. He took me out locally on natural history trips and to the Duke University Marine Biology Lab. By the time I was in high school he made sure someone took me along on Audubon bird counts. When I entered State as a freshman, Dr. Quay gave me a job as his assistant, an office with a view out onto the campus, and a key to the building. Almost immediately I began hanging out with Zoology Department graduate students, dressing the way they did and going to the field to assist in their thesis and dissertation research on birds and mammals. With that jump-start, I was trained and ready for grad school.\n\nMy master’s thesis advisor at Louisiana State University, George H. Lowery, Jr., came next and was one of the two persons who had the greatest impact on my career. One night in the fall of 1967, Doc (as we all called him) came down to my desk in the grad student warren in the basement of the Museum of Zoology and asked me to come along on a trip to the post office uptown. He said we had to find a thesis project for me. Doc focused his career on building the bird collection at LSU. Each year he sent a team of grad students to the Amazonian rainforest of Peru to collect birds and mammals and return the study specimens to the museum. I told him that I wanted to go to the tropics but wanted to do a research project rather than go on a collecting expedition. He said, “find a project, and I’ll send you.” At about the same time he had bartered for a shoebill and a kagu, representing the last two bird families missing from the museum’s collection. With that accomplished, he decided it would be good if his students learned the families of birds of the world. One, Zeledoniidae, had a single species – the wrenthrush. It had short, rounded wings, almost no tail, and was highly restricted in habitat and geographic range to the high elevation cloud forests of Costa Rica. Monotypic families are anathema to taxonomists, and was it a wren or was it a thrush? About two weeks after our conversation in the car, I went to Doc’s office and proposed a field study of the wrenthrush. It was morphologically and ecologically unique, making it suited to my interest, and it fell into Doc’s area of interest as well. He thought it was a great idea. But I said that I’d need transportation to go to and from my study site. He pointed through his office wall to the parking area outside and said, “Take the carryall!” But I said I’d need to get it there and didn’t speak a word of Spanish. “Take Al!” Doc put me on a museum assistantship as a source of income for the trip. He shared a good-ole-boy evening over Wild Turkey Bourbon with Edward McIlhenny Simmons and returned with a check to cover the costs of the trip. A bottle of McIlhenny Tabasco Sauce has adorned my office ever since. Early in 1968, Al Gardner, a Spanish speaking fellow grad student, and I hit the road. Our trip took 8 days. Al showed me how to get from San Jose to where a study area could be found, and about a week later he flew home.\n\nEverything significant in my early career came from that trip. When I returned, Doc encouraged and supported me in moving to a doctoral program with a stronger focus on ecology. In the summer of 1969, Frank A. Pitelka, an ornithologist and Head of the Department of Zoology at the University of California at Berkeley signed my application, saying “Oh, what the hell. Let’s give him a chance.” In Costa Rica in ‘68 I’d met a member of the selection committee, and the following summer was admitted to “Advanced Tropical Ecology,” a two-month course in Costa Rica co-coordinated by Daniel Janzen with Harold Mooney as the first visiting instructor. A year later, after searching in vain for a field site in northern California to study ant ecology, I wrote Janzen, who called and said to call Mooney before he left for Spain. Mooney was leading a comparative ecosystems program in the chaparral/matorral environments of California and Chile. He said to write a grant proposal and have it ready to go as soon as he was back from Spain. Not long after that I was on my way to Chile.\n\nThe Chile project had a sister project in the deserts of Arizona and Argentina. The director was Otto Solbrig, who also had been a visiting instructor on the advanced tropical ecology course. Otto wanted someone to look at ant communities and offered me two years of support as a post doc at Harvard. My sponsor was Edward O. Wilson, whom I’d met two years earlier at Berkeley. After the first year, I was worried about job prospects and accepted a one-year teaching appointment at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The faculty member there who recommended me to the dean was Theodore Fleming, someone else whom I’d met in 1968 in Costa Rica. Upon arrival in St. Louis, I began my inquiry into the origin of eusociality in paper wasps. I remained in St. Louis for 33 years.\n\nThe person with the second-most impact on my career is Raghavendra Gadagkar. In 2001 and at the invitation of Klaus Hartfelder, I gave a presentation to a meeting in Berlin of the North-west European Section of the IUSSI. Afterward, Raghavendra came up and said that he’d forgotten how much fun it is to listen to me think – the highest academic compliment I’ve ever received. At dinner the following evening he asked about the background of a paper I’d published in Evolution in 1999. I said that it was the only decent chapter of an unsuccessful mid-1990s attempt to write a book on the evolution of social wasps. He asked if I thought I might be ready to try again. I said yes. He said he knew of a place where I could do it – the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin. The where?? He described an academic institution in which 35 or so fellows of diverse disciplines come for a year, each to write a book. And then, with a bit of a twinkle in his eye, he said, “I’m on the committee that selects new fellows.” I knew in an instant that I’d just been invited to spend a year in Berlin.\n\nAcademic year 2003-04 at the Wissenschaftskolleg was one of the best years of my life, both personally and professionally. I wrote my book, The Evolution of Social Wasps, and restored my faith in my academic abilities. Along the way I had the second-most important Aha! insight of my career – that gyne paper wasps are in reproductive diapause. I promptly walked to the office of the Academic Director and said I’d like Wiko to fund bringing Gro Amdam for a week, that we’d write a paper together, publish it in Science, and change forever the way the origin of paper wasp eusociality is understood. He didn’t hesitate. Gro came and we worked on our separate parts before putting it together and submitting it to Science. It’s one of my favorite papers – an idea, a model, and no data.\n\nIn 2006, Eugene Robinson invited me to spend a semester in his lab at the University of Illinois. His only paper wasp student, Amy Toth, and I became academic friends and colleagues. She and Robinson’s lab tech, Tom Newman, taught me how to do bench work in a molecular biology lab, and we produced a nice paper together. During that same semester I enticed another grad student, Heather Hines, to take a look at the molecular phylogenetics of Vespidae. Her results showed unequivocally that sociality arose twice independently – subfamilies Stenogastrinae and Polistinae do not have a most-recent common ancestor. A vituperative rejoinder was published in defense of a single-origin of eusociality hypothesis, but in the end enough independent studies replicated Heather’s findings that there is no longer room for disagreement. In 2007, the Head of the Biology Department at N.C. State University, Damian Shea, provided me a 50% salary for three years to finish my career here. I took early retirement from UM-St.Louis, and the 3-year period carried me until I was old enough for full Social Security benefits. Although I now work from a home office and am no longer pursuing research, I’ll have an online virtual existence as a visiting Professor of Biological Sciences at State until I die.\n\n[When I arrived at NC State in 2007, the Head of the Department of Entomology offered me my choice of two offices. The one I selected had been my office in the summer of 1963 – and it hadn’t changed! I broke out laughing and asked if he could at least paint the walls and put down carpet. I turned it into the best-looking office in the building.]\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nJH: Know thy organism. Go outdoors. Learn where it lives, how it lives, how it behaves. Read natural history literature. If the organism occurs on the other side of the world, read the local natural history literature if you can handle the language. In particular, read older natural history literature. Researchers in both the past and now who document natural history have made valuable contributions. By reading their work you can glean tidbits of information or significant insights that may, either now or in the future, become cogs in the wheels of your thinking. Or if not yours, that of someone else.\n\nIf you see it report it. If something is unusual or unexpected, write a short note and publish it. This will mean placing papers in so-called “minor journals.” If you’re under pressure to earn tenure, put your observation in a file and publish it after you’ve passed that milestone. Do a thorough literature search before you publish. During your reading you may discover that your observation was reported decades ago but has been long overlooked. Give priority to that researcher.\n\nRead Darwin.\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nJH: My favorite place, by far, is the high elevation cloud forest of Costa Rica. I went for my master’s thesis research – a natural history study of an enigmatic little songbird, the wrenthrush, Zeledonia coronata. It’s a rare bird and hard to find. I’m the only person to have studied it in the field. I was the first to record its songs and calls, found the first nests to be reported in a publication (there were second-hand anecdotal mentions from the 1930s), and found the first eggs and nestlings. Albumin of the first-laid egg went to Charles Sibley at Yale, who was doing protein electrophoresis as a pioneering venture into molecular systematics. His finding that it was not a thrush was perhaps the only unequivocal new determination in his studies. But neither is it a wren – recent molecular phylogenetics has it out on a branch of its own, indicating mountain-top isolation a long, long time ago in a restrictive environment with a limited geographic range. I spent 101 nights at a roadside restaurant, La Georgina, at an elevation of 3,100 meters, a few kilometers from the 3,341 meter highest point of the Pan-American Highway near the 3,491 meter peak of Cerro de la Muerte – the mountain of death. Every night during the dry season the sky was clear and star-filled, and the temperature dropped to freezing. I slept in an Eddie Bauer 4 lb down sleeping bag (I still have it) on the bed in my room, which was about the size of a solitary confinement jail cell. When the rainy season came, nighttime temperatures were not quite down to freezing, but every day was chilly with fog, and cold rain was frequent. Sometimes the door to the restaurant would be left open, and fog just rolled into the dining room. I began to learn Spanish by going down the menu board on the wall and ordering every item except the white lightning rum (guaro) that truck drivers drank one shot after another to warm themselves before heading back out on the rocky unpaved highway. A website, “Driving the wild Cerro de la Muerte road,” describes the current highway as paved but filled with potholes, riddled with blind corners, hair-raising cliffs, and careless drivers. I never drove the highway at night.\n\nIt was high adventure. It was 1968. I was 23 and on my own for my first trip to the tropics. I wore long johns, and the guard dogs that spent every night inside the restaurant gave me fleas. The cloud forest floor was always wet, so I wore wool socks and high-top lace-up rubber boots. In the rainy season I wore rain pants and a rain jacket. In rainy season afternoons when my birds were no longer calling (the only way I could locate them in the dense, moss-covered vegetation), I headed out with a double-barrel 12-guage shotgun with supplementary cylinders I could drop inside to accommodate smaller 410 shotgun shells and even 32-caliber dust shot. I’d collect a bird or two, sit by the upstairs front windows for light (the generator ran only for breakfast and dinner), and prepare study specimens that I took back to the Museum at LSU.\n\nIS: Is there anything you wish we would’ve asked you that we should ask other social insect scientists in the future?\n\nJH: Although I’ve retired (and disappeared), I’d ask younger scientists to envision where their research program will be 5 years from now. 10? 20?\n\nIt’s been a good career.\n\nInterested in Jim’s treasure trove of research? Check out his website, which can be found here.\n\nYou can read Olivia’s research article about life cycle, nesting biology, and social organisation of the bee Exoneura angophorae at the upper extreme of its altitudinal distribution here.\n\nIS: Who are you, and what do you do?\n\nOB: My name is Olivia Bernauer, and I have been working with pollinators and social hymenopterans for the last eight years. Recently, my research interests have focused on foraging behaviour and the implications for pollination, examinations of pollination efficiency, which is a measure of how much pollen is deposited on a flower by different insects after a single visit, and social insect biology. In my recent publication, we investigated the nesting biology and social organization of the facultatively social allodapine bee, Exoneura angophorae, at the upper limit of its altitudinal range.\n\nIS: How did you develop an interest in your research?\n\nOB: I think two things led me to develop an interest in social insects and pollinators. First, I have been obsessed with flowers since I first learned to walk and talk, and second, I took an entomology course at UW Madison during my undergraduate education and fell in love with insects, in general. Once my eyes were opened up to the magical world of entomology, I viewed flowers with a new sense of wonder, savouring every flower visitor. Toward the end of my undergraduate education, I joined an entomology research lab and began an independent research project studying how a fungicide affects bumble bees and have been hooked ever since.\n\nIS: What is your favorite social insect, and why?\n\nOB: My favorite social insect is Bombus fervidus. I love all bumble bees, I mean, how can you not love such fluffy bees?! But B. fervidus is a really striking species, it’s got a rather long abdomen which is adorned in beautiful yellow hairs, and seeing them always brings a smile to my face. I also love how much the workers can vary in size, with some workers being quite large and, at first glance, could even be mistaken for a queen while others are so small.\n\nIS: What is the best moment/discovery in your research so far? What made it so memorable?\n\nOB: One of the most exciting moments of my research so far was when I first encountered the social parasite of Exoneura angophorae in my nest dissections from my recent publication. My supervisor had mentioned that I may come across these parasites, and to keep an eye out for them. I came across a nest of bees that looked quite similar to E. angophorae, but something was a bit off about them. I popped them under the microscope and sure enough, they were different bees – their faces were concave, mandibles tiny, and scopal hairs quite reduced. We encountered only a few other nests containing Inquilina species, only 8 out of 609, so each time we found them, it was very exciting. The next exciting work is to determine which Inquilina species we have found and whether it may be a new species.\n\nIS: Do you teach or do outreach/science communication? How do you incorporate your research into these areas?\n\nOB: Yes! I really enjoy engaging with the public to talk about insects, the importance of pollination, and what can be done to support insect pollinators. My lab group regularly engages with schools and community events to help educate school children and members of the public about the local insects which contribute to pollination. One of my favorite outreach tools is our “suitcase” stingless bee hives. They’re hives installed into wooden boxes with a sheet of plexiglass over the top of the hive. The flat and shallow design encourages the bees to spread out and when the suitcase is opened, we can show off the inner workings of the bee hives! My PhD work focused on apple pollination, and I also have had the opportunity to engage with our growers to share findings and discuss useful future research avenues. By collaborating with the growers, we can tailor our research to better understand pollination and assist the growers in solving any problems they may have.\n\nIS: What do you think are some of the important current questions in social insect research, and what’s essential for future research?\n\nOB: I think that further investigations into the biology of social parasites are an important future direction for social insect research. I know that some research has been done on bumble bee social parasites (Bombus (Psithyrus) sp.), but understanding other social parasites, for example, Inquilina sp., would be interesting and important.\n\nIS: What research questions generate the biggest debate in social insect research at the moment?\n\nOB: One area of social insect research that generates the most debate and discussion is the evolution of eusociality. It feels like this has been a subject of debate for a long time and that despite lots of good research, we still don’t have a complete picture of how eusociality evolved.\n\nIS: What is the last book you read? Would you recommend it? Why or why not?\n\nOB: The last book I read was The Less People Know About Us by Axton Betz-Hamilton. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery story. This book is a memoir about the author’s experience with identity theft and I first heard about her story on an episode of the Criminal podcast years before the book came out. I remember listening to the podcast with my jaw dropped in surprise about the twists and turns Axton’s story takes. When I found out she had also written a book about her story, I was eager to check it out and was not disappointed.\n\nIS: Outside of science, what are your favorite activities, hobbies, or sports?\n\nOB: I spend most of my free time outside. I love going for bushwalks and am obsessed with native flora. I get really excited when I find wild orchids and encounter new-to-me plants. I also enjoy fishing with my partner (I always catch the best fish), camping, and exploring new places. In summer I enjoy snorkelling and will spend hours observing creatures in tidepools when given the chance (see the adorable bubble snails below). When I can’t be outside, I like to spend my time reading true crime books and trying new recipes in the kitchen.\n\nIS: How do you keep going when things get tough?\n\nOB: For me, when things get tough, I typically take a break from the work and spend some time recharging with friends or in nature. Once I’ve had a bit of a rest, I’m able to get back to work and am able to work more effectively. It also helps me to take a step back and think about the big picture, what are my long-term goals and how will this work help me get there.\n\nIS: If you were to go live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things, what would you bring? Why?\n\nOB: If I had to live on an uninhabited island and could only bring three things with me, I think I would take a good magnifying glass, a sharp axe, and a hammock. I would bring the magnifying glass with me so that I could take a closer look at the plants and insects around me and, hopefully, I’d be resourceful enough to find a way to document and study them while on the island. I could also use the magnifying glass to start a fire to keep warm, cook food, and as a source of light. The sharp axe would have many uses, it would allow me to build a structure to live in and harvest food. The hammock would provide me a comfy place to sleep from the get-go and could also be used to provide protection from the sun until I was able to build a proper structure to live in.\n\nIS: Who do you think has had the most considerable influence on your science career?\n\nOB: When I think about my scientific journey, two people immediately come to mind. First, Dr. Robert Bohanan, my first scientific mentor, who facilitated my first independent research project. He taught me, leading by example, the importance of a high-quality mentor and helped to open my eyes to different avenues of science and teaching. I was fortunate to find another high-quality mentor in Dr. Hannah Gaines-Day. She mentored me through my first research project on bumble bees and helped encouraged me to pursue graduate school. I credit these two scientists for helping shape my first scientific experiences and for setting me on my current career path.\n\nIS: What advice would you give to someone hoping to be a social insect researcher in the future?\n\nOB: My advice to someone wanting to get involved in social insect research would be to seek out a high-quality mentor. Having someone to support you, challenge you, and share their expertise and experience is so beneficial when getting involved in research.\n\nIS: What is your favorite place science has taken you?\n\nOB: My favorite place science has taken me, so far, is to Australia. I found a PhD position advertised on twitter to study apple pollination in Australia and applied thinking there’s no way they’d pick the girl from Wisconsin, but 3.5 years later, here we are. It’s been such a delight to get acquainted with the Australian insect fauna, I have particularly enjoyed getting to know the stingless bee, Tetragonula carbonaria, which has the most beautiful, intricate, spiral comb and loves to forage on apple pollen! Plus, Australia has given me a chance to meet and appreciate some really neat ants including giant bull ants and the green weaver ants, which are quite tasty!\n\nIS: Is there anything you wish we would’ve asked you that we should ask other social insect scientists in the future?\n\nOB: If your study species could speak, what would you ask them?"
