He is a Biochemistry (2012) and master in Bioengineering, specializing in Molecular and Synthetic Biology (2014) by University of Minho, Portugal, with the Award of Best Student of School of Engineering (2014). He is member of Mexican Society of Biotechnology and Bioengineering (SMBB). Rafael has published 4 articles in indexed scientific journals and participated in 6 national and international congresses.\n\nRafael worked with purification of bioactive compounds of plants by two-phase aqueous systems, in master studies was worked with Synthetic Biology to produce natural compounds of plants with biological applications by an engineered Escherichia coli as step of project SYNBIOBACTHER: Synthetic biology approaches to engineer “therapeutic” bacteria. In 2015 started as research grant in project BiValBi – Biotechnologies to Valorize the regional Biodiversity in Latin America (PIRSES-GA-2013-611493). Currently, Rafael in the PhD development work with the valorization of avocado residues to obtain bioactive compounds with biological activities to apply in alimentary industry.\n\nRafael experience’s is in biology synthetic, bioactive compounds production by liquid fermentation and extraction of bioactive compounds by emergent technologies, characterization by analytical techniques and evaluation of their biological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, prebiotic, etc)."
