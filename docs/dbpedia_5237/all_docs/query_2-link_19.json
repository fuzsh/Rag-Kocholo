All papers submitted to the SIGCSE TS should be original work that complies with the ACM authorship policies. SIGCSE TS considers papers in three distinct tracks, each with their own unique expectations. See further details below.\n\nPaper Tracks\n\nPlease ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track by reading the the Reviewing Guidelines. Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not be moved between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.\n\nComputing Education Research. The primary purpose of Computing Education Research (CER) papers is to advance what is known about the teaching and learning of computing. CER papers are reviewed relative to the clarity of the research questions posed, the relevance of the work in light of prior literature and theory, the soundness of the methods to address the questions posed, and the overall contribution. Both qualitative and quantitative research is welcomed, as are replication studies and papers that present null or negative results.\n\nExperience Reports and Tools. The primary purpose of Experience Reports and Tools (ERT) papers is observational in nature, and ERT papers should carefully describe the development and use of a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use including the formative data collected, and provide a rich reflection on what did or didn’t work, and why. ERT contributions should be motivated by prior literature and should highlight the novelty of the experience or tool presented. ERT papers differ from CER papers in that they frame their contributions to enable adoption by other practitioners, rather than focusing on the generalizability or transferability of findings, or threats to validity.\n\nPosition and Curricula Initiative. The primary purpose of Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI) papers is to present a coherent argument about a computing education topic, including, but not limited to curriculum or program design, practical and social issues facing computing educators, and critiques of existing practices. PCI papers should substantiate their claims using evidence in the form of thorough literature reviews, analysis of secondary data collected by others, or another appropriate rhetorical approach. In contrast to CER papers, PCI papers need not present original data or adhere to typical qualitative or quantitative research methods. PCI papers differ from ERT papers in that they do not necessarily report on individual experiences, programs or tools, but rather they may focus on broader concerns to the community.\n\nPapers submitted to all tracks should address one or more computing content topic. Authors will be asked to select between 3 and 7 topics from this list at the time of submission. Papers deemed outside the scope of symposium by the program chairs will be desk rejected without review.\n\nAuthors submitting work to SIGCSE TS 2024 are responsible for complying with all applicable conference authorship policies and those articulated by ACM. If you have questions about any of these policies, please contact program@sigcse2024.sigcse.org for clarification prior to submission.\n\nNew for 2024: ACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID (https://orcid.org/register) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work.\n\nPresentation Modality\n\nPapers at SIGCSE TS 2024 can be presented either in-person using a traditional paper session or online via a synchronous Zoom session with Q/A. Pre-recorded videos will NOT be required. The online zoom presenters will be scheduled to present synchronously during the conference days just like the in-person presenters. Authors of accepted submissions must commit to one of these two presentation modalities in a timely manner to facilitate conference planning. Registration rates for online presenters are likely to be comparable to those for in-person attendees and higher than that of online-only attendees, which will help offset the additional costs of supporting online presentation. Further instructions and information will be provided in acceptance notifications.\n\nProgram Display Configuration\n\nTime Zone\n\nThe program is currently displayed in (GMT-07:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada).\n\nUse conference time zone: (GMT-07:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada) Select other time zone\n\nThe GMT offsets shown reflect the offsets at the moment of the conference.\n\nTime Band\n\nBy setting a time band, the program will dim events that are outside this time window. This is useful for (virtual) conferences with a continuous program (with repeated sessions).\n\nThe time band will also limit the events that are included in the personal iCalendar subscription service.\n\nDisplay full program Specify a time band\n\n-\n\nYou're viewing the program in a time zone which is different from your device's time zone change time zone\n\nThu 21 Mar\n\nDisplayed time zone: Pacific Time (US & Canada) change\n\n10:45 - 12:00\n\nCommunity College, Adult Education & PathwaysPapers at Meeting Room D135\n\nChair(s): William Kerney\n\n10:45\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nBroadening Participation in Adult Education: A Literature Review of Computer Science EducationGlobalCC\n\nPapers\n\nFriday Joseph Agbo Willamette University\n\nDOI\n\n11:10\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nCurricular and Pedagogical Considerations in Computer Science Education: The Role of Community Colleges for the Next DecadeCC\n\nPapers\n\nChristian Servin El Paso Community College, Elizabeth Hawthorne Rider University, Lori Postner Nassau Community College, Cara Tang Portland Community College, Cindy Tucker Bluegrass Community and Technical College\n\nDOI\n\n11:35\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nUnderstanding California's Computer Science Transfer PathwaysCC\n\nPapers\n\nJinya Jiang University of California, San Diego, Richa Kafle University of California, San Diego, Christa Lehr University of Southern Connecticut, Simone Wright University of California, San Diego, Clarissa Guitierrez-Godoy University of California, San Diego, Christine Alvarado University of California San Diego\n\nDOI\n\n10:45 - 12:00\n\nPeer MentoringPapers at Meeting Room D136\n\n10:45\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nWelcoming students to undergraduate Computer Science programs: On-ramps, rest areas, and lane changes\n\nPapers\n\nNiharika Bhaskar University of California San Diego, Amari Lewis University of California San Diego, Rona Darabi University of California San Diego, Joana Fang University of California Los Angeles, Jingting Liu University of California San Diego, Kristen Vaccaro University of California, San Diego, Joe Gibbs Politz University of California at San Diego, Mia Minnes UC San Diego\n\nDOI\n\n11:10\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nThe Experience of Near-Peer Computing Mentors: Strengthening and Expanding Women’s Computing Identities in Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Contexts\n\nPapers\n\nJennifer Rosales Barnard College, Elizabeth Melville Columbia University, Melissa Wright Barnard College, Saima Akhtar Barnard College, Rebecca Wright Barnard College\n\nDOI\n\n11:35\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nVirtual Peer Mentoring to Develop a Sense of Belonging During COVID-19 – A Pilot StudyMSI\n\nPapers\n\nSonal Dekhane Georgia Gwinnett College, Hyesung Park Georgia Gwinnett College, Lorraine Jonassen Georgia Gwinnett College, Wei Jin Georgia Gwinnett College\n\nDOI\n\n10:45 - 12:00\n\nIndustry and InternshipsPapers at Meeting Room E145\n\nChair(s): Daniela Marghitu\n\n10:45\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nFoot in the Door: Developing Opportunities for Computing Undergraduates to Gain Industry ExperienceMSI\n\nPapers\n\nNimmi Arunachalam Florida International University, Stephanie Lunn Florida International University, Mark Weiss Florida International University, Jason Liu Florida International University, Giri Narasimhan Florida International University\n\nDOI\n\n11:10\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nIndustry Mentoring and Internship Experiences at a Community College Baccalaureate Program in Software DevelopmentMSI\n\nPapers\n\nKendrick Hang Green River College, Tyler Schrock Green River College, Tina Ostrander Green River College, Roseann Berg Green River College, Tyler Menezes CodeDay, Kevin Wang Mentors in Tech\n\nDOI\n\n11:35\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nInstitutional Perspectives on Formal Work-Based Learning Programs in the UKGlobal\n\nPapers\n\nJack Parkinson University of Glasgow, Sebastian Dziallas University of the Pacific\n\nDOI\n\n10:45 - 12:00\n\nLarge CS1 ClassesPapers at Meeting Room E146\n\nChair(s): Albert Chan Fayetteville State University\n\n10:45\n\n25m\n\nTalk\n\nA Global Survey of Introductory Programming CoursesOnlineGlobalIn-Person\n\nPapers\n\nRaina Mason Southern Cross University, Simon , Brett Becker University College Dublin, Tom Crick Swansea University, James H.

The first step requires that authors submit all paper metadata and a plain text abstract in EasyChair no later than Friday, 11 August 2023. This data is used to allow reviewers to bid on potential papers to maximize the match of reviewer expertise to paper content. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible. The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.\n\nThe second step of the paper submission process is to upload the final anonymized PDF of the full paper for review. This must be completed no later than Friday, 18 August 2023. Authors who fail to submit an abstract by the first deadline will not be permitted to submit a full PDF.\n\nAbstact Due Date Friday, 11 August 2023 Abstract Due Time 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) Due Date Friday, 18 August 2023 Due Time 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth, UTC-12h) Submission Limits 6 pages + 1 page only for references Notification to Authors Monday, 2 October 2023 tentative Submission Link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigcsets2024 Session Duration 20 minutes\n\nInstructions for Authors\n\nAuthors may find it useful to read the Instructions for Reviewers and the Review Forms to understand how their submissions will be reviewed. Also note that when submitting, you will need to provide between 3-7 related topics from the Topics list under Info.\n\nAbstracts\n\nSubmission Templates\n\nDouble Anonymized Review\n\nACM Policies\n\nORCID IDs\n\nAbstracts\n\nAll papers must have a plain-text abstract of up to 250 words. Abstracts should not contain subheadings or citations. The abstract should be submitted in EasyChair along with paper metadata, and the same text should be included in the PDF version of the full paper at the appropriate location.\n\nSubmission Templates\n\nSIGCSE TS 2024 is NOT participating in the new ACM TAPS workflow, template, and production system.\n\nAll paper submissions must be in English and formatted using the 2-column ACM SIG Conference Proceedings format and US letter size pages (8.5x11 inch or 215.9 x 279.4mm).\n\nHere is an annotated PDF example that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.\n\nPage Limits: Papers are limited to a maximum of 6 pages of body content (including all titles, author information, abstract, main text, tables and illustrations, acknowledgements, and supplemental material). One additional page may be included which contains only references. If included, appendix materials MUST NOT be present on the optional references page.\n\nMS Word Authors: Please use the interim Word template provided by ACM.\n\nLaTeX Authors:\n\nOverleaf provides a suitable two-column sig conference proceedings template.\n\nPlease do not use the anonymous document class option, as counter-intuitive as that sounds. We’d like to ensure that author blocks appear in the submission, and that option removes them.\n\nOther LaTeX users may alternatively use the ACM Primary template, adding the “sigconf” format option in the documentclassto obtain the 2-column format. (ACM has recently changed the ACM template and we have not yet had a chance to verify that the new version works correctly.)\n\nNOTE: The default LaTeX template text shows appendix materials following the references. SIGCSE TS 2024 does not permit appendices on the optional page allotted for references. Authors must include all relevant content within the 6 body pages of the paper. References are the ONLY thing that can be added on page 7.\n\nRequirements for Double Anonymous Review Process: At the time of submission all entries must include blank space for all anonymous author information (or anonymized author name, institution, location, and email address), followed by an abstract, keywords, CCS Concepts, placeholders for the ACM Reference Format and copyright blocks, and references. For anonymized submissions, all blank space necessary for all author information must be reserved under the Title, or fully anonymized text can take its place (e.g. 4 lines containing Author1, Author1Institution, Author1Location, anon1@university.edu). In addition, please leave enough blank space for what you intend to include for Acknowledgements but do not include the text, especially names and granting agencies and grant numbers. Acknowledgements should be included in the first 6 pages.\n\nOther requirements: Please provide a separate block for each author, including name, email, institution, location, and country, even if authors share an institution.\n\nDesk Rejects: Papers that do not adhere to page limits or formatting requirements will be desk rejected without review.\n\nAccessibility: SIGCSE TS 2024 authors are strongly encouraged to prepare submissions using these templates in such a manner that the content is widely accessible to potential reviewers, track chairs, and readers. Please see these resources for preparing an accessible submission.\n\nDouble Anonymized Review\n\nAuthors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, provide the author(s) of the paper with an unbiased review. The anonymized version must have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). However, authors are reminded to leave sufficient space in the submitted manuscripts to accommodate author information either at the beginning or end of the paper. LaTeX/Overleaf users are welcome to use the anonymous option, but are reminded that sufficient room must exist in the 6 body pages to include all author blocks when that option is removed. Authors may choose to use placeholder text in the author information block, but we encourage authors to use obviously anonymized placeholders like “Author 1”, “Affiliation 1”, etc.\n\nSelf-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].\n\nAs per ACM guidelines, authors may distribute a preprint of their work on ArXiv.org. However, to ensure the anonymity of the process, we ask that you not publish your work until after you receive the accept/reject notice. If particular aspects of your paper require earlier distribution of the preprint, please consider changing the title and abstract so that reviewers do not inadvertently discover your identity.\n\nSubmissions to the Papers tracks are reviewed with the dual-anonymous review process. The reviewers and meta-reviewers (i.e. associate program chairs or APCs) are unaware of the author identities, and reviewers and APCs are anonymous to each other and to the authors.\n\nThe reviewing process includes a discussion phase after initial reviews have been posted. During this time, the reviewers and APC can examine all reviews and privately discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the work in an anonymous manner through EasyChair. Following discussion, the APC shall draft a meta-review that holistically captures the group position on the paper, incorporating views raised in the reviews and during the discussion phase.\n\nThe SIGCSE TS 2024 review process does not have a rebuttal period for authors to respond to comments, and all acceptance decisions are final.\n\nACM Policies\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\n\nORCiD ID\n\nACM has made a commitment to collect ORCiD IDs from all published authors (https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). All authors on each submission must have an ORCiD ID (https://orcid.org/register) in order to complete the submission process. Please make sure to get your ORCiD ID in advance of submitting your work. (If EasyChair does not request the ORCiD ID for your coauthors, you do not need to find a way to enter one.)\n\nAuthor Checklist\n\nAdditional details are in the instructions for authors.\n\nGetting ready\n\nMake sure that all authors have obtained an ORCiD identifier. These identifiers may be required for paper submission.\n\nIdentify at least one author who is willing to review for the symposium. Have that author or those authors sign up to review at https://bit.ly/review-SIGCSE2024. (If they’ve done so already, there is no need to fill out the form a second time.)\n\nDownload the appropriate template. Check this annotated PDF example that has some notes/tips and shows the required sections.\n\nSelect the appropriate paper track for your submission.\n\nReview the additional resources for the track.\n\nReview the instructions for reviewers and the review forms to see what reviewers will be looking for in your submission.\n\nLook at the list of topics in the Info menu on this site or on EasyChair and pick 3-7 appropriate topics for your submission. This helps in matching reviewers’ expertise with submissions and is different from the next item.\n\nMake certain that you have entered CCS concepts in your paper by choosing them from the ACM Computing Classification System site.\n\nLook at the EasyChair submission page to make sure you’ll be prepared to fill everything out. Note that you are permitted to update your submission until the deadline, so it is fine to put draft information there as you get ready.\n\nThe abstract on EasyChair\n\nNote: EasyChair does not let you save incomplete submission forms. Please fill out all of the fields in one sitting and save them. After that, you can continue to update the information in the fields and your submission until the deadline.\n\nSelect the appropriate paper track for your paper\n\nSubmit a 250-word abstract by 11:59 p.m. AOE, Friday, 11 August 2023.\n\nIMPORTANT: as you enter the author names in EasyChair consider the order. Author lists can NOT be modified (this includes add/remove/reorder)\n\nThe paper on EasyChair\n\nUse an appropriate template.\n\nEnsure that your submission is appropriately anonymized.\n\nEnsure that your submission is accessible. See accessibility tips for authors for further details.\n\nEnsure that your submission is no more than six pages (plus an additional page for references ONLY).\n\nIf you add Acknowledgements, anonymize the text and include them in the six pages. (they can NOT be on the additional page)\n\nSubmit the final version of your paper by 11:59 p.m. AOE, Friday, 18 August 2023.\n\nPost-Acceptance and Presentation Information\n\nPresentation Details\n\nIn-person presentations\n\nTLDR: Each talk is in a session containing three talks. Please check the schedule in the Program menu for when and where your talk will be presented. Please arrive at the beginning of the session. Your talk should be 20 minutes with 5 minutes for questions. You will need to bring your own laptop and an HDMI connector (e.g., an HDMI dongle for your laptop).\n\nPresentation Room & Technology\n\nAll presentation rooms will have a podium with a microphone, 16:9 (aspect ratio) projectors and screens, with a single HDMI cable for video, and speakers.\n\nYou must bring your own laptop or plan to use someone else’s, the symposium will NOT provide one for you. Please bring with you the appropriate dongle to connect your laptop to HDMI.\n\nDue to technical limitations in the convention center, paper presentations on-site in Portland will not be live streamed for virtual attendance. Nor will those attending the symposium virtually be able to present live in a physically scheduled paper session.\n\nPresentation Session\n\nThere will be three paper presentations in each of the in-person paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 25-minute block, which is a presentation of 20-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. The session chair will introduce the session, and then prior to each paper presentation, will introduce you (the presenter), keep track of time, and provide you with five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that the full paper presentation has a 25-minute limit and this is a hard stop time.\n\nSpeakers’ Lounge - Rm D133/134\n\nIn-person authors will have access to a speaker’s lounge room throughout the conference. This is a quiet space for you to grab a cup of coffee, meet with your co-authors, prepare for your presentation, or log in to a Zoom call without going back to your hotel room. You will find the speaker’s lounge in rooms D133/134 of the convention center.\n\nOnline presentation modality\n\nThe authors for the Online Papers will present their papers ONLINE over a Zoom Session, which will be streamed live in Rm. E146 in the Portland Convention Center. Therefore, the presentations of the Online Papers can be attended by both In-person Attendees (Rm E146) and Online Attendees (over Zoom).\n\nThe Zoom links will be sent to the online paper presenters on the day of their presentation.\n\nFormat of Online Presentation Sessions:\n\nThere will be three paper presentations in each of the Online Paper sessions. Each paper presentation is a 25-minute block, which is a presentation of 20-minutes followed by 5-minutes for questions and answers. A Session Chair will manage the session with the help of a Student Volunteer.\n\nSession Chair and Student Volunteer Responsibilities:\n\nThere will be a wired laptop logged into Zoom at the front of the room E146. The Session Chair, the Student Volunteer (and possibly a Hybrid Chair) will also be physically in the room and logged into Zoom to make sure that the online audience is muted and the online presenters are made co-hosts and can share their screens.\n\nThe Session Chair will introduce the presenter(s) before their presentations. To help presenters manage their time effectively, Session Chairs will use the Zoom Chat option to provide five-minute, two-minute, and one-minute warnings before the question and answer period begins. Please note that each full paper presentation has a 25-minute limit, and this is a hard stop time.\n\nSession Chairs and Student Volunteers will ensure that questions from in-person attendees are relayed to the online presenters. The Online audience can ask their questions by unmuting themselves or through the Zoom chat. The in-person attendees must ask questions by relaying their questions to the Student Volunteer or the Zoom Chat.\n\nPresentation Modality: Due Friday, 13 October 2023\n\nAuthors for all accepted papers must select a mode for presenting at the symposium (online or in-person). The first corresponding author on each paper should receive a survey by email shortly after acceptance notifications are sent. This survey should be completed only once per accepted paper.\n\nPresentation modality selection is required by 13 October 2023. If authors do not submit a modality choice by the deadline, the paper will default to online presentation modality and will not be assigned to an in-person session.\n\nRegistration:\n\nIn order for your paper to be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference. Please let us know immediately if you or your co-authors are unable to present your paper at the symposium so we can withdraw it.\n\nCamera-Ready: Due Wednesday, 14 December 2023\n\nAuthors should carefully consider the reviews when preparing final CAMERA-READY submissions. A camera-ready PDF must be submitted to Sheridan Communications for inclusion in the conference proceedings.\n\nAuthors can find initial instructions for preparing final camera-ready documents here: http://www.scomminc.com/pp/acmsig/sigcse2023.htm\n\nWe also remind authors to review the accessibility tips to ensure the symposium content is widely usable for all parties.\n\nOptional Video Presentations\n\nAuthors opting to provide the OPTIONAL video for the ACM DL as described in the camera-ready instructions, must check “YES” for being recorded on the ACM rights review form. If that option is not checked, the video will not be included in the ACM DL. Those who check “YES” will be asked to provide a video file for the ACM DL for the conference proceedings.\n\nResources\n\nSelecting a Track\n\nThere are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from a prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as best papers, which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.\n\nHere are the best papers from SIGCSE TS 2023 as examples that showcase the difference between the three paper tracks.\n\nComputing Education Research (CER)\n\nGeoffrey L.

Below, we list additional resources that you may find useful as you write your papers, especially computing education research papers.\n\nWriting a research question (csedresearch.org)\n\nReporting Tips (csedresearch.org)\n\nChecklist for Research Articles (csedresearch.org)\n\nEvaluation Instruments (csedresearch.org)\n\nWhat’s the difference between a research paper and an experience report? (Amy Ko)\n\nLanguage Editing Assistance\n\nACM has partnered with International Science Editing (ISE) to provide language editing services to ACM authors. ISE offers a comprehensive range of services for authors including standard and premium English language editing, as well as illustration and translation services. Editing services are at author expense and do not guarantee publication of a manuscript.\n\nInstructions for Reviewers\n\nThis page captures the reviewing policies of the papers tracks at SIGCSE TS. Please email the Program Chairs at program@sigcse2024.sigcse.org with comments or questions.\n\nThere are three different paper types at SIGCSE TS : Computing Education Research (CER), Experience Reports and Tools (ERT), and Position and Curricula Initiative (PCI). When authors submit a paper, they have to select to submit to one of the three different types of papers.\n\nSubmission System\n\nRoles in the Review Process\n\nTimeline\n\nPaper Reviewing Guidelines (CER, ERT, and PCI)\n\nReview Process Steps\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nRecalcitrant Reviewers\n\nSubmission System\n\nThe review process for SIGCSE TS 2024 will be done using the EasyChair submission system (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigcsets2024) . Reviewers will be invited to join/login into EasyChair, update their profile, and select 3-5 topics that they are most qualified to review. To do so, reviewers select SIGCSE TS 2024 > Conference > My topics from the menu and select at most 5 topics. More topics make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. Reviewers also identify their Conflicts of Interest by selecting SIGCSE TS 2024 > Conference > My Conflicts.\n\nRoles in the Review Process\n\nReviewers write reviews of their assigned submissions, evaluating them against the review criteria.\n\nAssociate Program Chairs (APCs) write meta-review for their assigned submissions and provide a recommendation (accept/reject) and feedback to the Program Chairs.\n\nProgram Chairs make the final decisions on the program based on recommendations from the APCs (for papers) and from track chai"
