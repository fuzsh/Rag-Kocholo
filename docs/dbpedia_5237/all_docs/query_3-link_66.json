        "text": "For late-round picks in the NFL draft, playing special teams is the best way for them to make an immediate impact and earn a roster spot in their rookie training camp.\n\nIf your favorite NFL team is looking for that kind of player in the 2019 draft, Pitt’s Rafael Araujo-Lopes is your man.\n\nA talented pass-catcher, return man and special-teams ace, Araujo-Lopes recently spoke exclusively with Draft Wire about his pro day workout, playing JUCO ball with 2018 top-10 pick Josh Allen, and what kind of skill set he brings to the next level.\n\nZH: You went the JUCO route out of college, how was that whole experience for you?\n\nRAL: I would say that the JUCO route was very humbling and it was hard. I went away from home, I am originally from Florida, so I went all the way to California kind of blind and not knowing what I was getting into. It was challenging. There were times that I didn’t really have any money to operate and having to prove myself in those circumstances were both challenging as well but I would definitely say it was humbling and it definitely molded me into the player and man I am today.\n\nZH: I noticed you played with (Buffalo Bills QB) Josh Allen at the JUCO level. What was it like to play with a guy who ended up being a top pick in the NFL?\n\nRAL: First of all, he is a really good friend of mine and I’m glad that I got the opportunity to play with him. It was awesome man. He’s such a competitor and I’m a competitor as well so we would just make each other better all the time. We would put in the hours, we would throw all the time and he’s such a great dude off the field too so we would spend a lot of time together. It was truly an honor to play with a guy like that and I was fortunate to catch a lot of his touchdowns. I think he trusted me, I was kind of like his go-to guy on third downs, I think I had like 17 of his 25 touchdowns or something like that but I was definitely fortunate to have him then.\n\nZH: You just had your pro day not too long ago, and put up some great numbers. How did it feel to put on a show like that for all the scouts in attendance?\n\nRAL: Going into the process, I was very anxious and there is a lot of pressure but I think going into that day I just really wanted to have fun. I just wanted to put my best foot forward and show the scouts that I really love to do this. I love to compete and I just tried to do that. I didn’t want to think too much about the details or the nuances of everything, I just wanted to go out there to perform and I’m glad I got the opportunity.\n\nZH: How would you describe your skill set?\n\nRAL: I’m more of a shifty and quick kind of guy. Definitely a really good route runner and I’d say that is an important part of my game. I think of guys like Julian Edelman or Doug Baldwin. Maybe not as big but smart with my game. It’s not necessarily the 4.2 speed or jumping 60 inch verticals but it’s kind of being real shifty, a really good route runner, understanding space, understanding the field, and making plays that way.\n\nZH: You were also a special teams guy at Pitt. Do you think you could contribute in that area immediately at the next level?\n\nRAL: I hope so. I’m really confident in my ability to return kicks and not just return them, in any part of special teams. Whether it’s running down on kick offs, whether it’s blocking on kick returns, whether it is even running down on punt I feel like I have a great understanding of special teams and enjoy playing teams. I feel like I can contribute right away if a team will give me an opportunity there.\n\nZH: Stepping off the field, what are some things you enjoy doing away from football?\n\nRAL: I would say traveling is one. I enjoy getting a taste of different cultures and meeting new people and just getting a taste of all the different diversities in this world. I’ve traveled to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and hopefully I can get further out to Asia or Europe. The other thing I like doing is work in the community. In my time at Pitt, I interned at an organization called Orange Arrow and they kind of introduced me to working with the youth, especially student athletes. I really enjoyed that kind of work with the youth or working in the community in any way I can.\n\nZH: What is my team getting if they draft Rafael Araujo-Lopes?"
