        "text": "With the European soccer season beginning once again at the end of the month, club teams all across the country are preparing for another long and grueling next 9-10 months.\n\nThe international tournaments are in the rearview mirror, and Saturday night will bring us a friendly match between two of the most notorious rivals in the sport: FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nThe game will take place at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and will begin at 7:00pm ET / 4:00pm PT. It will be shown live on ESPN+.\n\nBarcelona vs Real Madrid, latest updates from El Clasico friendly match in New Jersey\n\nThere isn't much more to say about the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid. It's the stuff of legends, and in many peoples' eyes, it's the most iconic rivalry in any sport. In official matches, Los Blancos hold the all-time lead with 105 wins to Barca's 100. There have also been 52 draws between the two.\n\nThe two reign supreme in LaLiga and have largely dominated the European stage over the past three or so decades, with Real Madrid continually earning bragging rights in that regard. Saturday will see the two sides fine-tune tactics and get playing time for as many players as possible.\n\nA good amount of Barcelona players are injured and will be out for this game. Frenkie de Jong, Gavi and Pedri are expected back before the start of the domestic season, but it will be tight. Ronald Araujo is dealing with a long recovery that could hold him out until December."
