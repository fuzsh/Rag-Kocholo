        "text": "One has seemingly been gaining points ever since his college career ended. The other has a point to prove.\n\nWhen Brazilian big man Rafael Araujo of BYU and University of Colorado center David Harrison go at it again today, no one will be keeping score. But what they can and cannot do — individually, and against each other — certainly will count for something.\n\nBoth are possible first-round selections in the June 24 NBA draft, and both are among four prospects planning to work out for the Jazz today.\n\nHow the two fare in sessions like this morning's could go a long way in determining how high or low each will be drafted, which is why there already is something of a hullabaloo over who is so far getting the best of whom.\n\nThe Deseret Morning News reported last week that 6-foot-11, 295-pound Araujo and 7-foot, 280-plus-pound Harrison had auditioned in front of scouts from four teams the previous weekend in Los Angeles — and \"Harrison's agent reportedly stopped the workout after 45 minutes of Araujo domination.\"\n\nCue the uproar.\n\nTwo days later, an Internet posting on the RealGM Web site addressed \"an article in the BYU-friendly Deseret News.\"\n\n\"Interestingly enough, we heard a completely different tale from people who were actually present,\" the Web story said. \"Araujo looked very good, much quicker than normal, and he displayed an excellent inside-outside game that made him very tough to guard. Harrison played good defense on the extremely physical Araujo, blocking a couple of his shots and doing a good job of beginning to shed the soft label he earned with three up and down seasons at Colorado.\"\n\nESPNInsider.com's Chad Ford weighed in a day after that.\n\n\"Contrary to at least one printed report,\" Ford wrote, \"Harrison did not quit the workout early. But several people who were in attendance claim he should have.\"\n\nFord also wrote that Araujo, whose stock has been on the rise since he finished his senior season at BYU, put on a \"display of strength and aggressiveness.\"\n\nThe response from Harrison, who is leaving Colorado after his junior season, was twofold.\n\nLast Saturday, the two went head-to-head again in a workout for Hawks scouts in Atlanta.\n\nAccording to another RealGM posting, \"we didn't see the one-sided result that supposedly favored Araujo in the last Harrison-Araujo matchup . . . but we did like the BYU center over the former Buffalo, mostly due to his fundamental footwork and quick shot.\"\n\nAnd in Sunday's Denver Post, Harrison addressed the issue of his first workout with Araujo, saying the Deseret Morning News report was \"frustrating\" and suggesting it was untrue.\n\n\"I'd rather die than stop the workout and let someone get the better of me,\" Harrison told the Post. \"We both did well in the workout. If (Araujo) thinks he got the better of me, then that's his opinion.\"\n\nThe battle of heavyweights continues today, when the Jazz host their second in a string of formal workouts in the weeks leading to the draft. Utah has three picks in the draft's opening round, Nos. 14, 16 and 21.\n\nNOTES: In addition to Araujo and Harrison, Providence All-America forward Ryan Gomes and Nevada swingman Kirk Snyder are scheduled to work out for the Jazz today. . . . Echoing sentiments he has expressed previously, Jazz veteran free-agent center Greg Ostertag reiterated in Thursday's Dallas Morning News just how much he would love to sign with his hometown Mavericks later this summer: \"I'm hoping they'll bring me in to talk about it at the appropriate time. . . . They need a rebounder and shot-blocker, which I can be. I'm going to look at all my options. But it would be my ultimate dream to play in Dallas.\" . . . Jazz scout Richard Smith watched Ha Seung Jin, an 18-year-old South Korean who stands 7-4 and weighs more than 320 pounds, and University of Utah shooting guard Nick Jacobson — in addition to high-schooler J.R. Smith — when he was in the Los Angeles area late last week. . . . Jacobson, whom Jazz scouts and coaches compare to a Fred Hoiberg-type shooter, also worked out in Cleveland on Thursday."
