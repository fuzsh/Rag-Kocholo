        "text": "Experience or potential? College or high school?\n\nMake that Connecticut or bust.\n\nThe Orlando Magic, riding the trend of younger players in the NBA, chose prep star Dwight Howard over UConn center Emeka Okafor with the first pick in the NBA Draft last night. He was the first of a record eight prep players to be picked in the first round.\n\nBut the Charlotte Bobcats, picking second, didn’t keep Okafor waiting. They were ecstatic to grab the MVP of the Final Four, who is more NBA-ready than Howard.\n\nThe pick settled the two intriguing questions heading into the draft. Orlando didn’t trade the pick and, unlike last year, when everyone knew the Cleveland Cavaliers were taking LeBron James, the Howard-Okafor debate raged.\n\n“It’s really hard to explain,” said Howard. “To be the first player selected, it feels so good. Now I’m ready to go to work.”\n\nOkafor was flattered the Bobcats traded up earlier this week to get the No. 2 pick. He said there is more pressure having been selected by Charlotte, because he understands his role as the cornerstone of the expansion franchise.\n\n“It makes me feel all warm inside,” said the Final Four MVP. “It just shows they be lieve in my ability. I know that their staff and everybody is fully behind me and has my best intentions at heart.”\n\nWith the top big man gone, the next question concerned which point guard would go first. Once again, it would force a GM to choose between a high school player or college player. The Bulls went with Ben Gordon, the former Mount Vernon star.\n\nWith the selections of Okafor and Gordon, both juniors, UConn took another step towards stamping itself as one of college basketball’s best-ever programs. Not only did the duo lead UConn to its second NCAA title, it made draft history.\n\nIn 1969 UCLA’s Lew Alcindor – who would change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – and Lucious Allen were the first and third players chosen. Duke’s Jay Williams and Mike Dunleavy went two and three in 2002. UConn joins the ranks.\n\n“It’s like a fairy tale,” said Gordon. “Two guys coming in in the same year, winning a championship together and then going 2-3 in the draft, it’s the greatest feeling in the world.”\n\nThe Clippers wasted no time in making a pick that should sit well with Elton Brand and Corey Maggette. They selected Shaun Livingston, giving the Clippers some of the best young talent in the NBA.\n\nColleges took the edge in the draft as Harris went fifth to Washington, which then included him in a trade package with Jerry Stackhouse to Dallas for forward Antawn Jamison.\n\nThe Hawks had a chance to select local favorite, Josh Smith, but instead opted for Stanford’s Josh Childress. Atlanta took Smith with the 17th pick. The Suns took Duke’s Luol Deng and traded him to the Bulls for a future No. 1 pick.\n\nThen the draft took a strange turn. Toronto selected BYU center Rafael Araujo, the first college senior taken. After the 76ers sought to take the scoring load off Allen Iverson by taking Arizona’s Andre Iguodala, Cleveland tabbed swingman Luke Jackson. Araujo and Jackson in the Top 10 were a surprise.\n\nBut nothing was more shocking than the Portland Trail Blazers using the 13th pick on Lincoln star Sebastian Telfair. There was some question whether Telfair would go in the first round.\n\nThe Nets used the 22nd pick on Victor Khryapa and immediately traded him to Portland for backup point guard Eddie Gill and cash. New Jersey prep star J.R. Smith went to New Orleans with the 18th pick.\n\nFirst round\n\n1. Orlando – Dwight Howard, PF, 6-11, 240, Southwest Atlanta Christian High School, Atlanta – Comparisons are being made to Kevin Garnett. No pressure.\n\n2. Charlotte – Emeka Okafor, PF, 6-10, 252, Connecticut – The Final Four MVP should be the cornerstone of the expansion Bobcats.\n\n3. Chicago – Ben Gordon, PG, 6-3, 200, Connecticut – The first point guard taken; Interesting pick because the Bulls already have a PG in Kirk Heinrich.\n\n4. Clippers – Shaun Livingston, PG, 6-7, 175, Peoria Central High School, Peoria, Ill. – Body by Olive Oil but great court vision have the Clippers thinking Magic.\n\n5. Washington – Devin Harris, PG, 6-3, 185, Wisconsin – Dealt to Dallas along with Jerry Stackhouse for Antawn Jamison. The heir apparent to Steve Nash.\n\n6. Atlanta – Josh Childress, SG, 6-8, 210, Stanford – The best Afro in the draft gives the Hawks an NBA-ready player. He can guard three positions.\n\n7. Phoenix – Luol Deng, SF, 6-8, 220, Duke – The Suns are dangling Shawn Marion as trade bait. Deng is an instant replacement.\n\n8. Toronto – Rafael Araujo, C, 6-11, 290, BYU – A physical post player who wasn’t expected to go this high. Allows Chris Bosh to play power forward.\n\n9. Philadelphia – Andre Iguodala, SG, 6-6, 207, Arizona – He can take the scoring load off Allen Iverson, if that’s what The Answer wants.\n\n10. Cleveland – Luke Jackson, SF, 6-7, 215, Oregon – A gritty, versatile swingman to complement LeBron James.\n\n11. Golden State – Andris Biedrins, PF, 6-11, 240, Latvia – The Chris Mullin era dawns in Golden State.\n\n12. Seattle – Robert Smith, C, 7-0, 225, Bakersfield High School, Bakersfield, Calif. – Has a center’s mentality but a prep player’s body.\n\n13. Portland – Sebastian Telfair, PG, 6-0, 165, Lincoln High School, Brooklyn, N.Y. – The Blazers fell in love with him and never varied when others said his stock fell.\n\n14. Utah – Kris Humphries, PF, 6-9, 235, Minnesota – Jazz find a quality backup for Andrei Kirilenko.\n\n15. Boston – Al Jefferson, C, PF/C, 6-10, 265, Prentiss High School, Prentiss, Miss. – Celtics, hoping to find that next great center, have a lot of rebuilding to do.\n\n16. Utah – Kirk Snyder, SG, 6-6, 225, Nevada – Had some of his best games against UConn, Michigan State, Gonzaga and Georgia Tech.\n\n17. Atlanta – Josh Smith, SF, 6-9, 210, Oak Hill Academy (Va.), College Park, Ga. – Might be the best raw athlete in the draft. Needs Hoops 101.\n\n18. New Orleans – J.R. Smith, SG, 6-6, 220, St. Benedict’s Prep, Freehold, N.J. – When GMs talk about potential, they’re talking about this kid.\n\n19. Boston – Dorrel Wright, SG, 6-7, 210, South Kent (Conn.) Prep, Los Angeles – A scorer more than a shooter, he has a very physical game.\n\n20. Denver – Jameer Nelson, PG, 6-0, 190, St. Joseph’s – Traded to Orlando where he can help develop the No.1 pick.\n\n21. Utah – Pavel Podkolzine, C, 7-5, 260, Russia – He’s tall. Traded to Dallas for a future No. 1.\n\n22. NETS – Victor Khryapa, PF, 6-9, 210, Russia – Traded to Portland for PG Eddie Gill and cash.\n\n23. Portland – Sergei Monya, SF, 6-8, 220, Russia – Not much playing time behind Zach Randolph and Darius Miles.\n\n24. Boston – Delonte West, SG, 6-4, 180, St. Joseph’s – One half of Boston’s backcourt of the future.\n\n25. Boston – Tony Allen, PG, 6-4, 213, Oklahoma St. – The other half – mentally tough and physically ready.\n\n26. Sacramento – Kevin Martin, SG, 6-7, 185, Western Carolina – Needs to get stronger but he can shoot out the lights.\n\n27. Lakers – Sasha Vujacic, SG, 6-7, 193, Slovenia – Idolized the late Drazen Petrovic, he hasn’t met a shot he doesn’t like.\n\n28. San Antonio – Beno Udrih, PG, 6-3, 203, Slovenia – Spurs hope he can backup Tony Parker.\n\n29. Indiana – David Harrison, C, 7-0, 250, Colorado – Jeff Foster will never be an All-Star center."
