        "text": "Johnny and Toni Lopez became soccer fans because of their three children. Their kids all played youth soccer in San Antonio while the parents drove them back and forth from games to practices. Soon, the family revolved around soccer, even though they didn't have a local team to root for back then.\n\nWhen San Antonio FC was revealed as the city's new USL franchise last week, Toni Lopez was in tears. She didn't just see a logo and a name. She saw future generations of San Antonians, grandkids with their grandparents, cheering together for their team.\n\n\"Soccer always has a place in my heart,\" Lopez said. \"We love how much it has grown in San Antonio as a sport, and we can't wait to start rooting for San Antonio FC.\"\n\nThe brand identity and San Antonio F.C. name were revealed in a ceremony at Rock & Brews at the AT&T Center, as about 250 fans attended to see their new colors. Fans erupted for another surprise, as the club also unveiled four more players signed to San Antonio F.C. All four have local ties as well.\n\nMidfielder Rafael Castillo helped lead the San Antonio Scorpions to the 2014 NASL Championship and was named MVP of the final, thanks to a bicycle kick-goal and an assist in the game.\n\nGoalkeeper Matt Cardone, a San Antonian who was a two-time Division III All-American at Trinity University and spent the 2015 season with the Scorpions.\n\nMidfielder Victor Araujo, another Trinity product who scored 20 goals with 18 assists in 43 total games with Trinity from 2013-2015.\n\nDefender Max Gunderson, who played college soccer at the University of the Incarnate Word and was with the USL's Austin Aztex for the 2015 season.\n\n\"It's really cool to play soccer in your hometown,\" Cardone said. \"This is something you dream about. It's important, especially for the youth playing soccer, to show that anything is possible.\"\n\nRyan Wells brought his family to the unveiling, including his 8-year-old daughter Yuriza and 4-year-old Yvanna. His family watched the Women's World Cup at home over summer, and Wells said soccer brings families together.\n\n\"We're going to show San Antonio spirit,\" said Yuriza, while 4-year-old Yvanna let out a long \"Yayyyyyyy\" and a couple other variations of \"Yeah!\"\n\nThe name and brand identity unveiling may have lasted for about 15 minutes, but the event turned into two hours of coach Darren Powell and managing director Tim Holt meeting with fans while the new players signed autographs.\n\nSan Antonio's soccer supporter groups, the Crocketeers and SA 118 led the crowd in chants, all to the delight of Holt. \"If we get the same type of atmosphere for our games, we'll be all set,\" Holt said. The atmosphere, to Holt, is one of the most exciting factors in building this club from the ground floor. Playing at one of the USL's best stadiums in Toyota Field and seeing the immediate reaction form local fans, Holt said the crowd response will be a game changer for San Antonio FC.\n\n\"Soccer's very different from other sports in this country,\" Holt said. \"Supporters want and need and demand to be engaged. It's not a passive experience if you do it right. We don't want to tell fans 'sing now, cheer now.' They're going to do that on their own, and we want to give them good ingredients for those cheers.\"\n\nFor Holt and Powell, the celebration was relatively short. Once the fans headed home, they went back to an AT&T Center conference room, where they've been working on building the opening-day roster.\n\nOne major date in crafting the lineup came on Friday, when 200 soccer players came to STAR Soccer Complex for the team's open tryouts. Most were local players while two flew in from France. Some were as young as 20 and one goalkeeper was 50. Many players had college and pro experience, while some, including Jermaine Malcolm, had no experience. \"It's a great opportunity,\" said Charles Weber, who flew in from Strasbourg, France along with Stephane Blanc. \"Soccer in America is high-quality, and you have a good coach, good complex and a good chance to play here.\"\n\nThose who impressed will receive a callback next week, where they'll be one step closer to a professional soccer contract. By then, the roster will have a few more additions, including some familiar faces, and Powell will have much of his coaching staff rounded out.\n\nIf the first 24 hours of San Antonio FC are any indication, Powell and Holt are going to be running at full speed until San Antonio FC's first game on April 3.\n\n\"We've got two months to take advantage of every day and capitalize on every opportunity we have,\" Holt said.\n\nWe are San Antonio FC.

We’re ready for kickoff.\n\nSAN ANTONIO – Spurs Sports & Entertainment (SS&E) officially unveiled today the brand identity for its USL San Antonio franchise. San Antonio FC (SAFC) will debut in front of its home supporters at Toyota Field on Saturday, April 9 against Sporting Kansas City affiliate Swope Park Rangers at 7:30 p.m. The team name and crest were unveiled at an event at Rock & Brews inside the AT&T Center on Thursday night.\n\n“This is San Antonio’s club,” said San Antonio FC Managing Director, Tim Holt. “As an organization, we are tied to this city like no other, so it became vital for us to reflect that in our name and crest. Everything from the club name, the shape of the crest and the team colors were carefully chosen to best represent San Antonio and reflect our relationship with this amazing city. We feel that our identity pays tribute to San Antonio’s culture and history, while lighting a new path for soccer in our community. We look forward to representing San Antonio and Spurs Sports & Entertainment through the beautiful game, as San Antonio FC.”\n\nThe creation of the San Antonio FC brand was inspired by the connections between San Antonio’s identity as a city, its unique heritage and the youthful spirit of the emerging soccer culture in the region and throughout the U.S.\n\nIncluding San Antonio as the primary identity in the club’s name solidifies San Antonio’s hometown roots, and proudly represents the city among the growing soccer culture in the country. FC commonly represents Football Club in clubs throughout the globe, and specifically in Mexico, Spain and Germany, which are historically connected to the origins of San Antonio and the South Texas region.\n\nThe shape of San Antonio FC’s badge was derived from a variety of traditional national and international club crests. The heart of the badge contains two prominent elements: the five diagonal stripes, which were inspired by the armed forces’ service stripes, are a salute to San Antonio’s rich military history and their upward movement signifies the club’s goal to play at the highest level; and the rowel of the Spur symbolizes the direct link between San Antonio FC and its parent company, Spurs Sports & Entertainment. Binding all of the interior elements is a single “S”—a subtle nod to our hometown heritage and how it unites us.\n\nBlack and silver are colors of strength and another element that’s synonymous with SS&E brands. The red accent color is pulled from the same red in the Texas state flag signifying the pride the club has in this state.\n\n“Our club now has its identity, and we can start representing the city of San Antonio with pride,” said SAFC Head Coach Darren Powell. “San Antonio FC, just like Spurs Sports & Entertainment, will be a big part of this incredible city. As a team, we are prepared to represent the supporters and San Antonio in a professional and respectful manner both on and off the field. I look forward to April 9 when we can step foot on the Toyota Field pitch together for the first time.”\n\nSan Antonio FC will be a brand deeply rooted in the unique traits of the city and the sport of soccer.

SS&E owns and operates the San Antonio Spurs (NBA), San Antonio Rampage (AHL), San Antonio Stars (WNBA), Austin Spurs (NBA Development League), San Antonio FC (United Soccer League) and also manages the day-to-day operations of the AT&T Center.\n\nSAN ANTONIO – Spurs Sports & Entertainment (SS&E) officially unveiled today the brand identity for its USL San Antonio franchise. San Antonio FC (SAFC) will debut in front of its home supporters at Toyota Field on Saturday, April 9 against Sporting Kansas City affiliate Swope Park Rangers at 7:30 p.m. The team name and crest were unveiled at an event at Rock & Brews inside the AT&T Center on Thursday night.\n\n“This is San Antonio’s club,” said San Antonio FC Managing Director, Tim Holt. “As an organization, we are tied to this city like no other, so it became vital for us to reflect that in our name and crest. Everything from the club name, the shape of the crest and the team colors were carefully chosen to best represent San Antonio and reflect our relationship with this amazing city. We feel that our identity pays tribute to San Antonio’s culture and history, while lighting a new path for soccer in our community. We look forward to representing San Antonio and Spurs Sports & Entertainment through the beautiful game, as San Antonio FC.”\n\nThe creation of the San Antonio FC brand was inspired by the connections between San Antonio’s identity as a city, its unique heritage and the youthful spirit of the emerging soccer culture in the region and throughout the U.S.\n\nIncluding San Antonio as the primary identity in the club’s name solidifies San Antonio’s hometown roots, and proudly represents the city among the growing soccer culture in the country. FC commonly represents Football Club in clubs throughout the globe, and specifically in Mexico, Spain and Germany, which are historically connected to the origins of San Antonio and the South Texas region.\n\nThe shape of San Antonio FC’s badge was derived from a variety of traditional national and international club crests. The heart of the badge contains two prominent elements: the five diagonal stripes, which were inspired by the armed forces’ service stripes, are a salute to San Antonio’s rich military history and their upward movement signifies the club’s goal to play at the highest level; and the rowel of the Spur symbolizes the direct link between San Antonio FC and its parent company, Spurs Sports & Entertainment. Binding all of the interior elements is a single “S”—a subtle nod to our hometown heritage and how it unites us.\n\nBlack and silver are colors of strength and another element that’s synonymous with SS&E brands. The red accent color is pulled from the same red in the Texas state flag signifying the pride the club has in this state.\n\n“Our club now has its identity, and we can start representing the city of San Antonio with pride,” said SAFC Head Coach Darren Powell. “San Antonio FC, just like Spurs Sports & Entertainment, will be a big part of this incredible city. As a team, we are prepared to represent the supporters and San Antonio in a professional and respectful manner both on and off the field. I look forward to April 9 when we can step foot on the Toyota Field pitch together for the first time.”\n\nSan Antonio FC will be a brand deeply rooted in the unique traits of the city and the sport of soccer. The club embraces and honors San Antonio’s military identity, while celebrating the cultural heritage of the marketplace. Through an authentic soccer experience where diverse cultures participate in creating a dynamic atmosphere, the soccer club unites with passionate fans toward a common cause to play at the highest level.\n\nSupporters can stay up to date with the club by visiting USLSanAntonio.com, and by liking San Antonio FC on Facebook, as well as following the team on Twitter (@SAFCUSL), Instagram (@sanantoniofootballclub) and Snapchat (@SanAntonioFC).\n\nFans interested in being a part of the inaugural season can place their $50 deposit for 2016 season tickets online at USLSanAntonio.com or by calling 210-444-5MLS.

Castillo was named the MVP of the championship match after scoring a memorable bicycle kick goal to give the Scorpions the lead in the second half.\n\n“Rafa is a fantastic and exciting player,” said Powell. “We are very honored to have him in San Antonio and I’m looking forward to working with him. He’s very passionate about the game and he loves this city, so he’s ready to be a leader and use his experience to help all players on this team.”\n\nCastillo was named to the 2014 NASL Best XI and scored 17 goals from midfield in 46 total appearances from 2014 to 2015.

In 27 appearances, Gunderson played in 2,188 minutes, tallying two assists from defense. The 26-year-old right back has also spent time with OKC Energy (USL) and the Laredo Heat of the PDL.\n\n“Max is a player who has experience in the USL and has done well in the league for multiple clubs,” Powell said. “He will bring us good defensive depth as we build our roster for the upcoming season.”\n\nSan Antonio FC will make its debut in front of home supporters at Toyota Field on Saturday, April 9 against Swope Park Rangers, the USL affiliate of Sporting Kansas City.\n\nFans interested in being a part of the inaugural season can place their $50 deposit for 2016 season tickets online at USLSanAntonio.com or by calling 210-444-5MLS.

He was focused on football, playing defensive back in college at Illinois State.\n\nMalcolm, 27, graduated from college in 2011 and has since started a nonprofit with his wife, RecChanges, focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle.\n\nGrowing up in Jamaica, Malcolm has always had a love of soccer and figured he’d give the tryout a shot. Sophia Young-Malcolm has a brother, Lemus Christopher, who is a goalkeeper for the St. Vincent and the Grenadines national team.\n\n“I always wanted to play soccer,” Jermaine said. “Football just kept me busy.”\n\nLining up at left back, Malcolm didn’t look the part of a first-timer. At 6-foot-4, he said his football instincts came in handy when it came to marking attackers.\n\n“I think football translates a little to soccer in terms of field vision, awareness and a feel for game speed,” Malcolm said. “It was different not having pads on, though. I automatically started to get a bit aggressive and I had to watch myself.”\n\nWhile Jermaine hopes for a callback from San Antonio FC, he and Sophia are busy with RecChanges and enjoying their permanent home in San Antonio.\n\n“We’ve both always been soccer fans,” Jermaine said. “To see it grow not just in San Antonio but in the United States, it’s been crazy. When this opportunity came up, I figured I had to try.”\n\nA few months later, it might be her husband’s turn.\n\nJermaine Malcolm showed up to Friday’s San Antonio FC open tryouts, hoping to catch on with a Spurs Sports & Entertainment team like his wife.\n\n“We have something competitive in us and we have to keep moving, I guess,” Malcolm said. “Sophia encouraged me to come out here, and it would be pretty amazing if we both wound up as pro athletes.”\n\nMalcolm was one of 200 soccer players who attended Friday’s open tryouts, as San Antonio FC prepares for its USL debut on April 3.\n\nWhile Sophia was a collegiate national champion and All-American in basketball, this Malcolm is more of a longshot.\n\nJermaine has never played organized soccer.

Sophia Young-Malcolm has a brother, Lemus Christopher, who is a goalkeeper for the St. Vincent and the Grenadines national team.\n\n“I always wanted to play soccer,” Jermaine said. “Football just kept me busy.”\n\nLining up at left back, Malcolm didn’t look the part of a first-timer. At 6-foot-4, he said his football instincts came in handy when it came to marking attackers.\n\n“I think football translates a little to soccer in terms of field vision, awareness and a feel for game speed,” Malcolm said. “It was different not having pads on, though. I automatically started to get a bit aggressive and I had to watch myself.”\n\nWhile Jermaine hopes for a callback from San Antonio FC, he and Sophia are busy with RecChanges and enjoying their permanent home in San Antonio.\n\n“We’ve both always been soccer fans,” Jermaine said. “To see it grow not just in San Antonio but in the United States, it’s been crazy. When this opportunity came up, I figured I had to try.”\n\nTAMPA, Fla. – The United Soccer League today announced the alignment, regular season and playoff format for the 2016 USL Season, with 29 teams set to compete in the league’s sixth season in pursuit of the USL Cup.\n\nSix new teams will join the USL in 2016, as Bethlehem Steel FC, FC Cincinnati, Orlando City B, Rio Grande Valley FC, the Swope Park Rangers and San Antonio are all set to compete in the new season.\n\nThe USL will continue in a two-conference format, with 14 teams making up the Eastern Conference and 15 teams making up the Western Conference.
