Now a doctoral candidate at the Ohio State University, Kristina's research examines how the use of messages, predominantly entertainment narratives, may attenuate health disparities among stigmatized social groups (e.g., racial minorities, individuals with mental illness, etc). Stories about stigmatized groups have been observed to improve the attitudes of the general public toward those stigmatized groups as well as encourage people to vote for policies that will support stigmatized groups. Similarly, these stories may embolden members of stigmatized groups to seek out health services, share their personal stories, and feel more confident in advocating for social support. As such, Kristina’s work aims to amplify marginalized voices through narratives to enhance access to health services that may be encumbered by a) negative attitudes held by the general public toward stigmatized groups and b) a lack of efficacy among stigmatized groups to access health services. As a pragmatic thinker, her work utilizes quantitative and qualitative methods to identify key factors in changing stigmatizing attitudes, behaviors, and social systems. Implications for her work include the potential to close the gaps in health disparities and promote health equity.\n\nDaniel Morales-Armstrong, history/africana and american studies, University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDaniel Morales-Armstrong is a joint PhD candidate in Africana studies and history at Penn, where he studies emancipation and memory in nineteenth-century Puerto Rico, placed more broadly within Caribbean and Atlantic contexts.

Okwandu, history, Harvard University.\n\nUdodiri R. Okwandu is a doctoral candidate in the history of science department and Presidential Scholar at Harvard University. Broadly, her research explores the intersection of race, gender, and medicine and social and cultural constructions of health and disease. Her dissertation traces how medical understandings of maternal mental illnesses – such as postpartum depression and psychosis – have been used to rationalize the “transgressive” behavior of childbearing women from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth century. In doing so, she demonstrates how these rationalizations served to either excuse or pathologize women in ways that mapped onto existing racial and class hierarchies. She illuminates the consequences of these discourses by examining various sites, including the courts, asylum, family planning clinic, psychoanalytic research “lab,” and sterilization laws.\n\nTermara Parker, neuroscience, Yale University.\n\nTermara Parker is a sixth-year PhD Candidate in the interdepartmental neuroscience program at Yale University.

Working between English and Spanish archives, this project examines the island’s free and enslaved communities and their transition into Maroon societies to trace how they forged and (re)elaborated meanings of freedom, community, and sovereignty. It also considers how these developments shaped and were shaped by the region’s political economy, the contexts of Afro-European cross-cultural encounters, and the ways these different groups understood these complicated landscapes in staking competing and overlapping claims in the early modern Caribbean.\n\nAnapaula Themann, psychology, University of Texas at El Paso\n\nAnapaula Themann is currently working toward a PhD in psychology (behavioral neuroscience) at the University of Texas at El Paso under the mentorship of Dr. Sergio Iñiguez.

Andrews, urban and regional planning, University of Maryland-College Park.\n\nOver the years, there has been a renewed interest in investing in historically distressed neighborhoods in the inner city. This economic escalation has contributed to increasing rates of displacement following redevelopment in forms commonly known as gentrification. As gentrification and displacement rapidly reshape neighborhoods across the U.S., low-income, Black, single mothers are forced to grapple with the rising cost of housing, the physical transformation of their communities, and the intentional displacement of their own families to make way for more affluent households.\n\nWhile low-income, Black women are arguably the most vulnerable to the social and economic pressures that accompany gentrification, single, Black mothers are understudies in gentrification scholarship; hence knowledge about their vulnerability, and outcomes during and post displacement, are unclear.\n\nIn addition, few studies have considered the barriers that Black mothers face in accessing social services and informal social supports post-displacement.\n\nBi'Anncha Andrews' dissertation research aims to fill an established evidence gap on gentrification and displacement, including the impact that it has on single-family households and where families go post-displacement, and provide an in-depth outlook of the consequences associated with displacement and the residual trauma experienced by Black women during the displacement process.\n\nAndrews says the purpose of her research is to generate a body of evidence that will enable improvement in social services, provide early intervention points that limit the number of vulnerable families forcefully displaced from their homes, and enable development of urban planning policies and practices that fosters sustainability among individuals and households that are at risk when new development occurs.\n\nWaheed Awotoye, oral biology, University of Iowa.\n\nA trained dentist, Waheed Awotoye's research focuses on understanding the contributions of genetic factors to the risk of craniofacial birth defects.

She designed and is the principal investigator on a grant-funded, IRB-approved study that employs spatial, qualitative, epidemiologic and psychometric methods to understand these impacts.\n\nHer work highlights the historical and sociopolitical factors, such as structural and environmental racism, that have impacted and influenced Black agriculture in the United States. The first aim is a descriptive epidemiologic study assessing the association of neighborhood demographics with the number of community gardens at the block group level. This study shows that both Black and low-income neighborhoods have a greater concentration of community gardens compared to non-Black and higher income areas. This work serves as an introduction to the landscape of agriculture in Philadelphia and begins to lay the groundwork to understand how collective agency and community resistance might occur in the city’s Black and immigrant communities.\n\nThe goal of her current research is to show City Council officials and the Mayor’s Office how urban agriculture benefits the health of residents.\n\nMargaret Ikape, physics, University of Toronto.\n\nMargaret Ikape is a PhD candidate in the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, David A Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto.

Williams argues that the concepts of racial planning, the racial state and racial capitalism might, in certain cases, better reveal connections between race, class and urban planning than the standard, and somewhat obfuscatory, rational planning/equity planning or efficiency/equity model.\n\nThe second question concerns what can and should be done within urban contexts once we recognize the causal significance of white supremacy as a sociopolitical system and its enduring consequences for our primary areas of concern (urban inequalities in housing, environmental quality, transportation, wealth, policing, among others). In what is the first article on the subject of reparations within the field of urban planning, Williams has proposed that we begin to intellectually develop a tradition of reparative planning.\n\nThe third question concerns the evaluation of reparative planning as an unfolding movement across American municipalities and regions."
