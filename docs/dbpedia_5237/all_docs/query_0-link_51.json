The classic University Honors Program has two phases: Lower Division Honors and Upper Division Honors. Students who complete both phases of the program and have attained an overall GPA of at least 3.20 will graduate “With University Honors.”\n\nStudents who complete only the first phase will be awarded the distinction of Lower Division Honors in recognition of their completion of 15 semester hours of University Honors coursework and the attainment of a minimum overall GPA of 3.00.\n\nStudents who complete only the second phase will be awarded the distinct Upper Division Honors in recognition of their completion of 12 semester hours of upper-division University Honors coursework and the attainment of a minimum overall GPA of 3.20.\n\nThe Honors PLUS Program has two levels of graduation and awards. The first level of distinction is Associate University Honors. Graduates earning Associate University Honors have successfully earned three points for Honors coursework, two points for engaged experiences and one point for an Honors elective, and the attainment of an overall GPA of 3.30.\n\nThe second level of distinction is Full University Honors. Graduates earning Full University Honors have successfully earned six points for Honors coursework, four points for engaged experiences, two points for Honors electives and the attainment of an overall GPA of 3.30.\n\nThe following candidates were slated for graduation with a University Honors Program distinction at the time of printing this booklet. The list is not to be considered official until final semester grades are received and all program requirements are met and officially recorded. Some names listed may or may not receive their listed honors. Some names may have been omitted due to GPA and/or University Honors requirements at the time of printing this booklet.\n\n2024 May Candidates\n\nMay 2024 Undergraduate Degree Candidates\n\nThe roster of candidates listed in this bulletin is a compilation of those eligible to participate in the ceremony as of February 2024. It should not be construed as an official list of those who have received or will receive a university degree.\n\nCollege of Business\n\nCollege of Education\n\nCollege of Engineering and Engineering Technology\n\nCollege of Health and Human Sciences\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n\nCollege of Visual and Performing Arts\n\nMay 2024 Undergraduate Degrees with Distinction\n\nStudents listed here have applied to graduate at the end of the spring semester and are being considered as candidates to graduate with degrees with distinction. GPAs are computed on the basis of all work attempted during those semesters which include the last 45 hours of work completed and in progress toward this degree at NIU.\n\nDegrees with distinction awarded as follows:\n\nCum Laude 3.50 to 3.749; Magna Cum Laude 3.75 to 3.899; Summa Cum Laude 3.90 to 4.00.\n\nNOTE: GPA calculation includes grades earned at the end of the fall 2024 semester. This list is not to be considered official until all grades are received for the spring 2024 semester and the student’s GPA is recalculated.\n\nPlease also be advised that some names may have been omitted due to the student not meeting the GPA requirement at the time of printing this booklet; conversely, some students listed may not receive the honor indicated. The appropriate honor will be noted on both the student’s diploma and official transcript.\n\nSumma Cum Laude\n\nMagna Cum Laude\n\nCum Laude\n\nCommencement Program\n\nThis commencement program lists the names of individuals who have applied for graduation on the presumption that all the requirements have been, or will have been, met by the end of the semester. To be listed in this program, individuals were required to apply for graduation by the respective posted dates at the Graduate School or at the Office of Registration and Records. The fact that a candidate’s name is listed in this program does not indicate that they will in fact qualify for graduation.\n\nPhotographs\n\nA professional photograph of each graduate will be taken during the ceremony by Grad Images. To ensure that all graduates and their families and friends can view and enjoy the ceremony, we ask that guests be considerate of one another when taking photographs.\n\nNondisclosure of Directory Information\n\nIn accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, students who have chosen not to release directory information to public disclosure (which includes, but is not limited to, degrees conferred) will not appear in this program."
