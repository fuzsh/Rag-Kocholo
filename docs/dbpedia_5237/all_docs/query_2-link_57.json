        "text": "Heterodox Economics Newsletter\n\nIssue 296 web pdf Heterodox Economics Directory\n\nI had a conversation with my plumber these days. He is a smart man, who often tells stories that help to sharpen my economic intuition. A few months ago he explained to me how his company began hoarding inputs to confront increased uncertainty about the reliability of provision through global value chains. While they never actually experienced a logistical bottleneck, simply accounting for the possibility of such a bottleneck occurring changed their expectations in a way that led to self-reinforcing effects as increased hoarding obviously puts additional pressure on the demand for such inputs. Similar to Merton's classic example of a bank run, such cases of self-reinforcing expectations in particular (and self-reinforcing effects in general) pervade economic processes and make them complex objects that can easily develop in unexpected, non-linear ways.\n\nThese days he told me that his phone is running hot constantly since the war in Ukraine started as people want to switch from gas and oil to alternative heating facilities. This is a big issue in Austria, my home country, as much heating relies on fossil energy and much fossil energy is imported from Russia. And indeed, my plumber's description clearly indicates that this is one of the rather rare cases, where supply cannot accomodate demand or at least cannot do so without significant lags of several months, in some cases even years. While this is an interesting idiosyncracy that informs us a little about how contingent the interplay between supply and demand actually is, the more depressing observation is that fear of Putin's aggression and an escalating conflict with the EU in terms of economic sanctions has accomplished what constant news about how our planet is burning could not do: namely motivate the Austrian population to undergo a large scale shift in preferences for alternative heating systems. While I, of course, appreciate the overall outcome in this case (bettter now than never!), I would have preferred a more enlightened and forward-looking approach by my fellow countrymen as an earlier strive for a shift would obviously have allowed us to more fully exploit the potential associated with such a large-scale reswitching of heating-facilities.\n\nFrom all this we see that my plumber is somewhat similar to Elon Musk: both are a single persons that help us to sharpen our economic intuition for understanding the inner workings of capitalism. Elon does so very well currently â by simply buying Twitter he illustrates perfectly well how vulnerable private media can be to the private interests of those, who reside at the top of the wealth distribution ;-)\n\nAll the best,\n\nJakob\n\nPS: In this issue I tried to incorporate some items â like information on a new journal on the Circular Economy or some books dedicated to innovation studies â that might be of relevance for getting the much-needed socio-ecological transformation going. In general we try to get a better grip on the expanding discourse of ecological economics, but we somewhat depend on researchers active in this area to submit more info â my feeling is, we currently miss too many nice events, journal-issues and conferences associated to ecological issues in general and ecological economics in particular. So please, if you should take note of something that should also be posted in the Newsletter simply forward it to newsletter@heterodoxnews.com!\n\nÂ© public domain\n\nTable of contents\n\nCall for Papers\n\nMarxism 21: Special Issue on \"Recent Developments in Marxian Value Theory\"15th History of Recent Economics Conference (HISRECO) (Lausanne, October 2022)26th FMM Conference: Post-Keynesian Economics and Global Challenges (Berlin, October 2022) 28th Annual Conference on Alternative Economic Policy in Europe (London, September 2022)Call for book chapter contributions \"Economic policy in transition economies - an institutional perspective\"Celebrating Adam Smith at Journal of the History of Economic Thought (JHET)Dezernat Zukunft's Call for Papers: Waiting for WagesHistory of Economic Thought Society of Australia Conference (Melbourne, September 2022)International Conference on \"Power and Knowledge from the 18th Century to Today\" (Nancy, November 2022)International Financial Forum: Call for Papers on âThe challenges facing financial markets under the uncertainties of the 21st century\" (Grenoble, July 2022) Journal for Social Inclusion: Special Issue on \"Indigenous Emancipation\" Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination: Special Issue on \"Applications of Complexity for resilient organizations, management and innovation systems\"Marxism 21: Special issue on â\"Recent Developments in Marxian Value Theory\"Second Young Scholars Conference on Structural Change and Industrial Policy in Africa (online, June 2022)WINIR 2022 Virtual Conference on \"Polycentric Governance & the Challenges of the 21st Century\" (Online, September 2022)\n\nCall for Participants\n\nSASE Panel on \"Fractious Feminisms and Feminist Solidarities\" (online, May 2022)11th Post-Keynesian Economics Summer School (University of Greenwich, June 2022)2nd International Workshop of the Structuralist Development Macroeconomics (Online, June 2022)3rd ISEE Doing Ecological Economics seminar (Online, May 2022)4th Webinar âInstitutional and Organizational Economicsâ (Barcelona, June 2022)Contested Markets Conference (Paris, June 2022)HYPEÂ webinar series on \"The urgent need to build a new world order - a new international financial architecture - to tackle climate breakdown\" (Online, May 2022)Political Economy of the European Peripheries Summer School (Portugal, July 2022)Progressive Economics 2022 (London, 11 June 2022)SMEIE - First Edition Summer Module on Economics and Institutions in Europe (Trento, September 2022)Summer School in Network and Data Science (London, June 2022)\n\nConference Papers, Reports, and Podcasts\n\nCultures of Expertise in Economics: In Conversation with Dr. Danielle GuizzoSDMRG Webinar with Professor Amitava Dutt\n\nJob Postings\n\nOECDSheffield University, UKThe International Institute of Social Studies (ISS), NetherlandsThe Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG), GermanyUWE Bristol, UK\n\nAwards\n\nGAIA Masters Student Paper Award 2023: Call for SubmissionsPierangelo Garegnani Thesis Prize 2022: Call for submissionsThandika Mkandawire Prize: Call for submissions\n\nJournals\n\nBrazilian Journal of Political Economy 42 (2)Economy and Society 51 (2)Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review 19 (1)Forum for Social Economics 51 (2)History of Economics Review 81 (1)International Journal of Political Economy 51 (1)Journal of Post Keynesian Economics 45 (1)Metroeconomica 73 (2)New Political Economy 27 (3)Review of International Political Economy 29 (2)Review of Radical Political Economics 54 (1)The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought 29 (2)The Review of Black Political Economy 49 (2)\n\nBooks and Book Series\n\nA Modern Guide to Post-Keynesian Institutional EconomicsHandbook of Economic StagnationHandbook on Alternative Theories of InnovationInterest and Capital: The Monetary Economics of MichaÅ KaleckiMeasuring Innovation Everywhere:The Challenge of Better Policy, Learning, Evaluation and MonitoringPermanent Revolution: Reflections on CapitalismProperty Will Cost Us the EarthResearch Handbook of Innovation for a Circular EconomyTemp: The Real Story of What Happened to Your Salary, Benefits, and Job SecurityThe Great Inequality\n\nHeterodox Graduate Programs, Scholarships and Grants\n\nISRF Political Economy Fellowship Competition: Call for applicationsURPE Dissertation Fellowship 2022\n\nNewsletters\n\nWEA Commentaries 12 (1)\n\nFor Your Information\n\nNew Journal: Circular Economy\n\nCall for Papers\n\nMarxism 21: Special Issue on \"Recent Developments in Marxian Value Theory\"\n\nMARXISM 21, founded in 2004, is a bi-lingual (Korean and English), quarterly academic journal specialized in Marxist studies.

The increasing availability of archival materials, along with the development of new perspectives inherited from the larger history and sociology of knowledge, has helped to provide insightful histories of the development of recent economic practices, ideas, and techniques. In particular, this area of research offers good opportunities to young scholars who are interested in interdisciplinary approaches to the history of economics.\n\nFor this edition, we are also interested in papers dealing with the history of accounting and social quantification, extending into the interwar period. Paper proposals that use approaches from the history and sociology of science, or cultural and science studies, as well as those that build bridges between economic history and the history of economics, will be particularly appreciated.\n\nWe invite researchers in the history of postwar economics and related fields to submit a paper proposal of no more than 800 words. Proposals should be sent electronically (as a pdf file) to FranÃ§ois Allisson (Francois.Allisson@unil.ch) or harro.maas@unil.ch by May 31, 2022. Successful applicants will be informed by June 30, 2022. Drafts of the presented papers are due by October 10.\n\nWe aim to provide financial support to selected participants, but as yet cannot make any firm commitments on this. Preference will be given to young scholars. Scholars who are interested in such funding should include in their proposal a CV of no more than two pages, including current affiliation and year of thesis defense (if applicable) and a list of publications.\n\nThe organizing committee: FranÃ§ois Allisson (University of Lausanne, Switzerland), ClÃ©o Chassonnery-ZaÃ¯gouche (CRASSH, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom), Pedro Duarte (Insper Institute of Education and Research, Brazil), Yann Giraud (CY Cergy Paris UniversitÃ©, France) and Harro Maas (University of Lausanne, Switzerland).\n\nFor further information please visit the website.\n\nApplication Deadline: 31 May 2022\n\n26th FMM Conference: Post-Keynesian Economics and Global Challenges (Berlin, October 2022)\n\nGermany, 20-22 October 2022 | Berlin, Germany\n\nConference Theme: Post-Keynesian Economics and Global Challenges\n\nPost-Keynesian economics, based on the original works of Keynes, Kalecki, Kaldor, Joan Robinson, Minsky and others, has been the main alternative to orthodox and mainstream macroeconomics for decades and has inspired the FMM since its beginning. The 2022 conference aims to take stock of post-Keynesian and other critical contributions with a focus on how they deal with current global macroeconomic challenges. These include high and rising imbalances and inequalities at national and global levels, and the need for social-ecological and economic transformation to address the environmental crisis. While these challenges require coordinated government intervention, both nationally and internationally, policymakers are faced with high public debt and, more recently, rising inflation rates. At the same time, the global financial architecture puts severe limits on the ability of countries in the Global South to conduct macroeconomic policies that can address the current economic and social challenges. We will discuss how post-Keynesians have analysed these problems applying different theoretical and empirical methods and have economic policy alternatives.\n\nConditions and strategies for economic development: Structuralist and Keynesian monetary approaches\n\nInequality and stagnation: Contributions of Kaleckian and Sraffian Supermultiplier models\n\nAgent-based and SFC models\n\nGender inequality, the care economy and macroeconomics\n\nKeynesian modelling of supply side dynamics\n\nMonetary and fiscal policies under the conditions of high public debt and rising inflation\n\nPost-Keynesian approaches to the ecological crisis: green transformation and development finance\n\nSubmissions on the general subjects of the FMM, macroeconomics and macroeconomic policies, are encouraged as well. We particularly welcome submissions forgraduate student sessions. Those who have already presented a paper at a student session in previous FMM conferences should submit to the regular sessions to improve chances for newcomers. There will also be a day ofintroductory lecturesfor graduate students prior to the opening panel on 20 October. Hotel costs will be covered for graduate student presenters (max. four nights). A limited number of travel stipends for graduate student presenters will be sponsored by INETâs Young Scholar Initiative (YSI).\n\nApplication procedure:\n\nProposals are to be submitted electronically viat his web application.

To illustrate the process, the case of Central and East European (CEE) transition economies has been chosen, due to very interesting developments that this particular region went through in past decades: abrupt system transition from command economy and Soviet bloc to capitalism in 1990's, accession to the European Union and the attached globalization, as well as post-GFC structural adjustments. All these circumstances impact the policy choices in diverse socioeconomic areas, such as the recent populist shifts in some of the CEE economies. They may appear as unexpected or chaotic, yet they can also be perceived as embedded in the historical political economies of the region. Thus, the main objective of the monograph is to illustrate the historical and institutional embeddedness of contemporary policy choices in CEE economies, with the highlighted aspects of continuity and change.\n\nAn important source of inspiration for the book lies in the thought of Karl Polanyi (Polanyi 1944; Aulenbacher et al. 2019; Blyth 2002; Hann 2019). Here, the socio-economic transformation in CEE countries may be perceived through the lens of requirements of capital accumulation, which leads to inter-related processes of commodification, privatization and alienation. However, expansion of markets and the growing disembeddedness of economy from its social and environmental foundations lead to recurring crises, when diverse social forces of counter-movement gain on significance (Fraser 2017; Kentikelenis 2018).\n\nWe invite the Authors of proposed chapters to analyze selected sectors and the respective policies used by national authorities in a chosen CEE transition economy. The analysis of contemporary policies and problems associated with them should be put in institutional and historical contexts, with a focus given to aspects of institutional continuity (path dependence) and change (its mechanisms and actors). We also invite Authors of chapters that would preferably describe the situation in a couple of transition economies, which would set the ground for comparative analyses, as well as enable drawing more universal conclusions.\n\nEditors: Maciej Grodzicki, Anna Zachorowska-Mazurkiewicz, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland\n\nNotes for Authors\n\nAuthors of the chapters are invited to send an abstract of ca. 500-700 words to anna.zachorowska@uj.edu.pl or maciej.grodzicki@uj.edu.pl by end of May 2022. Further information will be send out to Authors after the acceptance of the abstract. The collected abstracts will form a basis of a book proposal currently submitted to the publishing house.\n\nApplication Deadline: May 2022\n\nCelebrating Adam Smith at Journal of the History of Economic Thought (JHET)\n\n2023 marks the 300th anniversary of Adam Smith's birth, and the Journal of the History of Economic Thought (JHET) would like to commemorate the occasion by bringing together a collection of short pieces on favorite Smith quotes. We would like to invite you to write a short piece (up to 1,000 words) telling which is your favorite Smith quote and why. We would like to have pieces on different quotes. Should we receive more than one piece on the same quote, we would select only one to be published.\n\nWe would expect to receive the manuscripts by August 15th, to have the time for the production process of the issue that will be published next year.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this celebration, please let us know by email before June 15th. We will then provide further details on how to submit your contribution.\n\nApplication Deadline; 15 August 2022.\n\nDezernat Zukunft's Call for Papers: Waiting for Wages\n\nDezernat Zukunft has published a call for papers on the question \"How will wages develop in Germany in the coming years?\". The best submission will be rewarded with 2500â¬, max. 2500 words (German or English, both possible).\n\nWaiting for Wages: Analysis of Future Wage Developments in Germany\n\nThe German labour market has been doing well in recent years: unemployment is at historical lows, employment is high. Even the Covid-induced slump did not deflect Germany from this positive long-term path. Wages, however, are not developing in a way that a favourable overall economic context and high labour demand would suggest. While in general, collective bargaining has recently resulted in higher wage agreements than in the late 1990s, and while nominal and real wages increased faster than the EU27 average, vast differences between economic sectors remain. A look at gross hourly wages reveals a similar picture. Given the favorable labour market situation, the Bundesbank therefore assesses the development of hourly wages agreed through collective bargaining as \"moderate\" (annual average of 2.4% between 2014 and 2017); the same holds for the effective earnings (2.7% annual average between 2014 and 2017).\n\nIn the wake of the Covid crisis, increasing commodity prices and rising inflation, unit labor costs in Germany stagnated in 2021, with real wages declining by 0.1% year-on-year. With the war in Ukraine, fears of rising consumer prices have increased once again, and the impact of refugees on the labour market is so far difficult to predict. All of this will have a lasting impact on the upcoming collective bargaining rounds and wage negotiations as a whole.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the question arises: How will wages in Germany develop in the upcoming years?\n\nWe are offering a prize of â¬2,500 for the best answer to this question. The focus of your paper should be on the quantitative analysis of wage indicators and should be presented in a maximum of 2,500 words (excluding data sets & sources, which can be added to the appendix).\n\nEvaluation criteria are:\n\nEmpirical foundation of the analysis\n\nContextualization and qualification of the analysis\n\nClarity and strength of the argument\n\nReadability of the text\n\nAdd on: accessible and insightful visual presentation of the data\n\nConsideration should include wage trends for 2022 and 2023, but may go beyond.\n\nThe text can be written in German or English. The winning analysis will be published on our website. The deadline for submission is 31/5/2022, 12 p.m. CET. Please send your work in PDF format to info@dezernatzukunft.org (subject: \"Call for Papers Wages\"). If you have any questions, please contact Pola Schneemelcher (pola.schneemelcher@dezernatzukunft.org). The full call for paper is available in English here.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 31 May 2022\n\nHistory of Economic Thought Society of Australia Conference (Melbourne, September 2022)\n\n21-23 September, 2022 | Melbourne, Australia\n\nThe History of Economic Thought Society of Australia (HETSA) announce a call for papers to be presented at the 33 conference which will be held in Melbourne on 21 to 23 of September. The convenor will be Alex Millmow, his email for expressions of interest is here. The venue will be the Monash Conference Centre in the heart of Melbourne. It will be an in-person conference. Registration cost will be $220 (australian) for the two-day conference. It will be preceded by a cocktail evening at a Club nearby. This will be the first HETSA conference in nearly three years given the Covid 19 menance.\n\nFor further information please visit the website.\n\nInternational Conference on \"Power and Knowledge from the 18th Century to Today\" (Nancy, November 2022)\n\n24-25 November 2022 | University of Lorraine, Nancy, France\n\nScholars from the University of Lorraine, UniversitÃ© de Strasbourg, UniversitÃ© LumiÃ¨re Lyon II, Richmond: The American International University in London, UK and University of Hull, UK are organising an international conference on \"Power and Knowledge from the 18th Century to Today\".\n\nDating back to the beginnings of Greek democracy and the Platonic conception of the philosopher king, the relations between power and knowledge have recently come back to the fore with the rise of populism or the sanitary crisis. Whether an obstacle to democracy, a means for citizens to control their representatives or a vehicle for regenerating democracy (Mounk, 2018), knowledge now appears, more than ever before, as a constitutive feature of government. This interdisciplinary conference will seek to explore the implications of such relations since the 18 century and to examine to what extent knowledge may establish, legitimize or discredit the forms and figures of political power. Alongside the democratic ideal, the specialisation and secularisation of knowledge during the Enlightenment gave rise to conceptions of a social order based on knowledge, be it Robert Owenâs utopian schemes, Comtean positivism or the clerisy called for by S. T. Coleridge. As mass democracy spurred the growth and influence of political parties, debating societies and think tanks appeared with the aim of influencing political decision-makers as well as public opinion, precipitating reforms and asserting the dominance of thought over action (Stone & Denham, 2004; Landry, 2021). In the liberal and democratic project, education has come to represent a valuable means of promoting citizenship for reformers ranging from philanthropists, socialists and liberals, to philosophical traditions such as British idealism or American pragmatism (Tyler, 2006; Dewey, 1916). On a broader scale, cultural critics or intellectuals have invoked their learning or expertise to purportedly counterbalance institutional power or to exert influence in the public sphere.\n\nThat knowledge may imply coercion has been the butt of criticism from multiple traditions. Together with the poststructuralist movement inspired by Michel Foucault or cultural studies, critics of modernity such as Eric Voegelin, hostile to what he deemed a gnostic conception of power, or Carl Schmitt, for whom Hegelâs philosophy implied an âeducational dictatorshipâ, have concurred in their questioning of Enlightenment optimism, dismissing knowledge as a necessary condition for progress and holding it to be the locus of a political struggle.\n\nThe debate has been central to the theorization of disciplines, understood as fields of knowledge that presuppose the existence of âdisciplesâ and therefore some form of authority (Moran, 2002). If the specialisation of knowledge seems inevitably linked to the world being perceived as increasingly complex, what are the checks on expertsâ judgements? Can a government reliant on specialised knowledge be genuinely democratic? Can philosophy, as Nietzsche would have it, challenge the claims of objectivity and disinterestedness voiced by âwe, scholarsâ? Or should principles and values regulating knowledge and information in the public sphere be formulated to overcome the current âepistemic tribalismâ underlying the surge in disinformation and conspiracy theories (Rauch, 2021)?\n\nKnowledge also stands at the intersection of political power, economic and social policies and ideologies. New Labour governments, for instance, claimed to base their agenda on the knowledge economy while fostering a brand of governance dubbed by some as technocratic or managerial (Dillow, 2007 ; Parry & Protherough, 2002). On this view, the crisis of democracy has been assumed to originate in an intellectual eliteâs promotion of identities, amounting to Â« the critical demolition of foundationalism Â» (Lasch, 1995), or in a system giving birth to Â« a bloated cognitive class Â» (Goodhart, 2021). More fundamentally, the Hayekian critique of constructivist rationalism set out in Â« The Use of Knowledge in Society Â» (Hayek, 2014) and the Keynesian conception of economic policy (Dow & Hillard, 1995) paved the way for an ongoing debate over the possibility of knowledge serving both social justice and liberty in a democratic regime.\n\nWith an interdisciplinary approach, the conference will welcome proposals dealing with the relations between knowledge and power from the 18 century to today: papers can address the history of political and/or economic ideas, intellectual, cultural and political history or political science and sociology.\n\nIn-person presentations, in English or in French, will be encouraged but arrangements for remote delivery may be made. A selected number of papers may be published.\n\nPapers may discuss, but are not limited to\n\nExperts, intellectuals, scholars in the public sphere\n\nThink tanks and debating societies and their relations with rulers, parties and ideologies\n\nHistoriography as a political project\n\nPolitical economy as the art of governing and/or economic science in the service of the political (mercantilists, physiocrats, classics, scientific socialistsâ¦)\n\nThe disciplinary evolution of economics: depoliticisation and politicisation\n\nKnowledge as constitutive of national identity\n\nThe legitimisation of policies through science\n\nThe fashioning of the elite (intellectual trajectories and influences, training, Oxbridge, the Ivy League, the formation of canonsâ¦)\n\nCommitted academics and knowledge as a channel for protest: Cultural Studies theorists and practitioners, neo-Conservative intellectuals, cultural criticsâ¦\n\nThe specialisation of knowledge and democratic representation\n\nPower and knowledge in formal institutions and/or the public sphere\n\nSubmissions\n\nPlease send proposals in English or in French (300 words maximum) and a short biography to powerandknowledge@scienceconforg by 24th June 2022. You will be notified early July about the committeeâs decision.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 24 June 2022\n\nInternational Financial Forum: Call for Papers on âThe challenges facing financial markets under the uncertainties of the 21st century\" (Grenoble, July 2022)\n\n11-13 July, 2022 | University Grenoble Alpes, Saint Martin-dâHÃ¨res Campus\n\nThe âNew Millenniumâ began with so much hope for progress on many fronts, such as poverty reduction, food supply, the energy transition to a more sustainable world, and the creation of new modes of inclusion in economic and social development. Financial market reforms, at the heart of our modern economies, have been the âhobbyhorseâ, an outpost of the era of liberal organization of economies from the 1980s onwards. A myriad of diverse financial innovations have emerged and spread to all sectors of the economy. The development of financial markets and economic development were seen as two sides of the same coin, the social optimum and prosperity. However, after two decades of great expectations, the New Millennium has proven to be an era of obstacles and constraints that seem to threaten the viability of open and democratic societies. Global systemic financial crises have recurrently erupted in advanced as well as in emerging market economies, development processes have come to an abrupt halt in developing countries under the threat of social, political and military instabilities, geopolitical concerns have swelled notwithstanding numerous international agreements and coordination plans. Old and new risks have (re)emerged and challenged our ability to build a more viable and sustainable planet.\n\nThis conference, in the form of an international forum for in-depth discussions, aims to question these different issues with a special focus on financial stability and systemic risks in order to propose new and renewed economic approaches that could offer sustainable solutions to help make the development of our societies more resilient in the face of economic, environmental and social challenges and risks. Innovations in these areas require careful consideration of the complex and interdependent nature of current wealth accumulation regimes and thus respond to the challenges of the millennium.\n\nPapers in the following areas will be particularly appreciated:\n\nGreen and sustainable finance\n\nFinancial stability and ESG changes\n\nAgricultural insurance under the climate changes\n\nRisk and its management in financial markets\n\nBlack swan events of the 21st century in financial markets\n\nFinancial stability during the Covid-19 pandemic and post-pandemic policy responses\n\nFinancial innovations and their influence on financial markets\n\nFuture of financial regulation: challenges and priorities\n\nBehavior in financial markets and decision-making process\n\nThe proposals must be submitted in pdf file at: faruk.ulgen@univgrenoble-alpes.fr, according to the following standard plan:\n\nTitle of the paper\n\nName(s) of author(s)\n\nPostal and e-mail address(es) of author(s) (in case of co-authors, underline the name of the correspondent)\n\nAffiliation of the author(s), and\n\nAn abstract of less than 600 words.\n\nRegistration fees and links\n\n40 â¬ including coffee breaks and lunches during the conference\n\n20 â¬ online participation and students (please, provide a copy of the student card at the time of registration)\n\n45 â¬ gala dinner on July 12, 2022\n\n(Information on the registration process will be sent to participants with the proposal acceptance message.

In particular, referring to the last period, characterized by the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ineluctability, a complex approach, able to deal with uncertainty and resilience, can be very useful to support the decision- making processes of governments, policy makers, managers, companies, and organizations.\n\nFinding new approaches and solutions to change mindset and rethink organizations, man- agement and innovation systems to be resilient has become the new imperative in management research. In this regard, complexity principles demonstrated being particularly effective as a refer- ence to understand and face the current competitive, economic, environmental and social dynamics affecting nowadays businesses. Complex systems composed of interdependent agents can be found everywhere on multiple scales, from the micro level, involving firms, work teams, and individuals to the macro level, including industries, markets, and countries. They are characterized by differ- ent dimensions of complexity, such as diversity and heterogeneity of agents, networks linking the agents, imperfect/ambiguity of available information and environmental dynamics.\n\nThe study of complexity in modern organizations requires dynamic and systemic approaches. They allows one to model complex system behaviors, reproducing the internal dynamics of the whole system from the bottom, focusing on its micro elements such as the agents, their attributes, actions and goals, and the network structure (and type of relationships) that connects them. In this regard, methodologies based on agent-based modeling, networks, system dynamics, evolutionary game theory, percolation theory are very suitable. In addition, the recent advent and spread of the availability of new technologies for massive data collection offers new opportunity to scholars. They permit to measure and evaluate complex system dynamics through data-driven methodologies. By providing automatic and more objective measurements of individual, team and firm behaviors, these tools can efficiently collect a large amount of data in real time - increasing the data richness, quality, and reliability.\n\nThe special issue aims at attracting high-quality contributions that make use of these ap- proaches and address the issue of complexity in organizations, management and innovation systems. Papers that adopt innovative theoretical and empirical methodologies are particularly appreciated. We invite researches aimed at investigating the drivers of complexity in organizations, manage- ment systems, and value chains (and business ecosystems) in different business sectors. Papers analyzing the relationship between complexity and resilience are particularly welcome, to elucidate how organizations can foster their resilience in the current competitive scenario.\n\nExemplary research questions\n\nHow can complexity theory help to advance research on organizations, management, and innovation?\n\nWhat are the drivers of complexity in organizations, management systems, and value chains?\n\nHow can the relationship between complexity and resilience be investigated in organizations, management, and innovation systems?\n\nHow can organizations foster their resilience in a competitive scenario?\n\nHow can complexity theory help to improve firm performance?\n\nHow complexity theory can support policy advice to foster resilience of organizations, value chains, networks, and innovation systems?\n\nHow can complexity theory methodologies (e.g.: agent-based modelling & simulation, social networks analysis) support research and policy making about resilience in organizations, value chains, networks, and innovation systems?\n\nGuest editors\n\nSilvano Cincotti, Universit`a degli Studi di Genova â silvano.cincotti@unige.it\n\nIlaria Giannoccaro, Politecnico di Bari â ilaria.giannoccaro@poliba.it\n\nCristina Ponsiglione, Universit`a degli Studi di Napoli âFederico IIâ â ponsigli@unina.it\n\nLinda Ponta, LIUC â Universit`a Cattaneo â lponta@liuc.it\n\nAndreas Pyka, University of Hohenheim â a.pyka@uni-hohenheim.de\n\nDeadline for Submission: 30 November 2022\n\nMarxism 21: Special issue on â\"Recent Developments in Marxian Value Theory\"\n\nMARXISM 21, founded in 2004, is a bi-lingual (Korean and English), quarterly academic journal specialized in Marxist studies.

As a result, African countries continue to record significant balance of payment deficits as they import manufactured consumer and capital goods. The 2008 global financial crisis, and more recently the global economic downturn associated with COVID-19, revealed the consequences for these commodity dependent countries. The push towards greater regional integration through the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) has brought to the fore the need to strengthen productive capabilities and to advance industrialisation in African countries to maximise the benefits of trade. There has been growing emphasis on industrial policy in many African countries in recent years, yet uneven implementation and outcomes. There are important knowledge gaps around various dimensions of structural change and industrial development in Africa, making research in this field especially important.\n\nFollowing the success of the inaugural conference in 2021, the Second Young Scholars Conference on Structural Change and Industrial Policy in Africa invites papers from young scholars whose work engages with these themes. We especially encourage research that takes a pluralist perspective. The purpose of this conference is to contribute to scholarship on structural change and industrial development and policy in Africa, specifically among young scholars.\n\nMost of the conference will proceed in parallel thematic sessions. Senior international scholars will act as discussants to provide feedback on presented papers. The conference will be held virtually, and attendance is free and open to the public, especially young scholars. Certificates confirming presentersâ participation will be provided on request.\n\nWe hope to compile selected papers from the conference into a proposal for a journal special issue. Applicants indicate their interest on the submission page.\n\nSubmission requirements\n\nPresentation at the conference is open to students, postdocs and early career researchers. Submissions are invited around the broad themes of structural change, industrial development and industrial policy in Africa. Studies with a sub-national, national or supra-national focus are all welcome.\n\nTopics could include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIndustrialisation and deindustrialisation in Africa\n\nThe political economy of industrial policy in Africa\n\nDiversification, economic complexity and industrial development in Africa\n\nThe financing of industrialisation in Africa\n\nMacroeconomics of structural change in Africa\n\nGendered aspects of industrial development and policy in Africa\n\nInnovation and technological upgrading in Africa\n\nLearning and capabilities in industrial development in Africa\n\nThe 4IR and industrialisation in Africa\n\nGreen industrialisation and green industrial policy in Africa\n\nDistributional and labour market aspects of industrial development in Africa\n\nIndustrial hubs (parks, zones, districts etc.) in Africa\n\nTrade and industrial development in Africa\n\nRegional and global value chains in Africa\n\nRegional integration in Africa\n\nIndustrial policy post-COVID\n\nIndustrial sector studies in Africa\n\nComparative studies of industrial development between Africa and other regions.\n\nAs part of the submission, extended abstracts of 600-800 words are required. The deadline for submissions has been extended to 17 May 2022. Submissions can be uploaded here. For queries or technical assistance, please contact Mrs. Koketso Manyane-Dlangamandla (email: sarchiid@uj.ac.za).\n\nAwards\n\nThis year, we will be recognising outstanding papers with awards for the Best Paper ($750) and Runner-up Best Paper ($250).

Yet our understanding of the variety and evolution of such governance arrangements, and our capacity to evaluate their operation and performance, remain in its infancy. As Elinor Ostrom observed, this state of affairs is to a large extent imputable to the tendency to explain phenomena and imagine governance solutions in terms of the standard dichotomy between âprivateâ and âpublic,â or âmarketâ and âstate.â\n\nInterdisciplinary institutional research into polycentric governance is vital. Rising to the challenges facing us in the 21st century â ranging from natural resource depletion, decarbonization, food insecurity and international migration to civic disaffection, personal data management, scientific knowledge sharing and space exploration â will require viewing these pressing problems through the lens of polycentricity.\n\nThe 7th WINIR Conference will explore these and other related issues. The conference will take place online from Tuesday 6 to Friday 9 September 2022.\n\nKeynotes lectures will be given by:\n\nElizabeth Baldwin (University of Arizona, USA)\n\nTine de Moor (Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands)\n\nHarini Nagendra (Azim Premji University, India)\n\nIndividual abstracts and 3 or 4-paper session proposals related to the conference theme or any other aspect of institutional research in line with WINIRâs aims and research priorities are welcome.

Leading feminist scholars share their insights into how feminisms, in their diversity, shed new light on economics and political economy.\n\nThis panel brings together leading feminist scholars and researchers to share their insights into how feminisms, in their diversity, shed new light on economics and political economy. If malestream traditions dismiss feminists as fractiousâas \"making trouble and complaining\"âthis panel asserts the usefulness of feminisms for troubling problematic assumptions and critiquing absences within dominant traditions of economics and political economy. Indeed, given significant income and wealth inequities, global conflicts and climate change, feminisms and feminist solidarities are more necessary than ever before. This panel opens up critical conversations about reimagining economics and political economies in ways that foreground feminist responses to the major concerns of our times.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nElaine Coburn\n\nJayati Ghosh\n\nMartha E.

Key assumptions in Post Keynesian Economics are that individuals face fundamental uncertainty about the future; there is a central role for âanimal spiritsâ in the determination of investment decisions; inflation is the result of unresolved distributional conflicts; money is an endogenous creation of the private banking system; unemployment is determined by effective demand on the goods markets; financial markets are prone to periodic boom-bust cycles.\n\nPost Keynesian theory is part of a broader Political Economy approach which highlights the social conflict and power relations between classes such as labour, capital and finance and social groups stratified along the lines of gender and ethnicity. Economic analysis should thus be rooted in a historic and institutional setting.\n\nYou can find the full program and the information for registration here.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 15 June 2022\n\n2nd International Workshop of the Structuralist Development Macroeconomics (Online, June 2022)\n\n8-10 June 2022 | Online\n\nStructural Development Macroeconomics can be understood as an approach to the deep determinants of economic development in which the macroeconomic policy regime has a crucial role in explaining international growth rate differences, notably among middle-income countries. It strongly relies on a multidisciplinary but rigorous assessment of the subject that combines some of the main elements of classical development and demand-led growth theories. The idea is to provide a somehow unifying view of development processes from a macro and dynamic perspective.\n\nRecently, economic theory has witnessed an important shift in its methodology due to the challenges presented in the aftermath of the Great financial crisis and the need to design sustainable development strategies to fight climate change. Certainly, Structural Development Macroeconomics can provide substantial advancements in understanding the world and facing such troubles. However, the task in front of us requires an interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, it should lead to a cross-fertilisation of fields, tools, and narratives.\n\nMain Topics of the Workshop\n\nSustainable Development\n\nEcological Transition and Structural Change\n\nGrowth and Distribution in Demand-led Economies\n\nDevelopment, Infrastructure and Convergence Clubs\n\nFinancial Fragility and Business Cycles\n\nStock-Flow Consistent Models (SFCs)\n\nAgent Based Models (ABMs)\n\nMonetary Policy, Exchange rates, and Public Debt\n\nApplication procedure:\n\nParticipants should send an expanded Abstract of 1000 words or less (clearly identifying the question or issue you will address in the paper and explaing the approach you will use to address the issue of interest).

The webinar will discuss distributional and implementation challenges and how carbon policies can be designed to avoid disproportionate impacts across society.\n\nPaula Novo (Leeds U.) will moderate a debate around this subject between Sadhbh Sheeran (Assistant Consultant on the Carbon and Climate Change team at Arup Ireland), Brian Oronoz (Carbon Market Coordinator at Plan Vivo Foundation) and Magnus Merkle (PhD candidate at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences)\n\nThe interactive youtube discussion will happen here: Thinking about carbon policies and management - YouTube\n\n4th Webinar âInstitutional and Organizational Economicsâ (Barcelona, June 2022)\n\n2 June 2022 (from 2:00 pm to 3:30 pm CEST) | Barcelona School of Economics, Spain\n\nThe Grenoble Applied Economics Lab (GAEL), the Grenoble Economic Research Center (CREG) and the Research Institute for the Political Economy of the Firm (IREPE), in partnership with the Grenoble Doctoral School of Economics (EDSE), invite you to the fourth Webinar Institutional and Organizational Economics on \"Managerial Leadership, Truth-Telling and Efficient Coordination\" with Jordi Brandts.\n\nWe study the MS game, a novel coordination game played between a manager and two subordinates. Unlike commonly studied coordination games, the MS game stresses asymmetric payoffs(subordinates have opposing preferences over outcomes) and asymmetric information (subordinates are better informed than managers). Efficient coordination requires coordinating subordinatesâ actions and utilizing their private information. We vary how subordinatesâ actions are chosen (managerial control versus delegation), the mode of communication (none, structured communication, or free-form chat), and the channels of communication (i.e. who can communicate with each other). Achieving coordination per se is not challenging, but total surplus only surpasses the safe outcome when managerial control is combined with three-way free-form chat. Unlike weak-link games, advice from managers to subordinates does not increase total surplus. The combination of managerial control and free-form chat works because under these conditions subordinates rarely lie about their private information. Our results suggest that common findings from the experimental literature on lying are not robust to changes in the mode of communication.\n\nJordi Brandts is a research Professor at IAE-CSIC and BSE Research Professor. He is also a Research Fellow of CESifo. His research is experimental in areas such as the study of cooperation, organizational economics, industrial organizational and market analysis, conflict and the effects of communication on strategic interaction. From 2008-2013 he held the Serra-Ramoneda/Catalunya Caixa Chair at the Department of Business at UAB. From 2007-2011 he was Editor-in-Chief of Experimental Economics. He currently serves as Advisory Editor for Games and Economic Behavior, Associate Editor of Review of Economic Design, and Senior Editor of the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance. He is also European Vice-President of the Economic Science Association.\n\nPlease register online for this event.\n\nContested Markets Conference (Paris, June 2022)\n\n3-4 June 2022 | PanthÃ©on Centre, University Paris 1 PanthÃ©on-Sorbonnem Paris, France\n\nConference Theme: \"Contested Markets: Theories and Controversies\"\n\nThis conference brings together diverse researchers working on the appropriate boundaries of markets with the aim of identifying commodification studies as an independent and crucial field of multidisciplinary research unto itself.

It is time to build a new world order. We know it is possible because it has been done before. In this contribution, Ann Pettifor will explore how this can be achieved.\n\nBio\n\nAnn Pettifor is best known for predicting the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-9 with her book: The Coming First World Debt Crisis (Palgrave, 2006). In 2019 she wrote The Case for The Green New Deal. In January 2022 the Scottish government appointed her to its Just Transition Commission.

Theoretically, it will revisit and combine hitherto unconnected strands of the relevant literature, mobilizing concepts like core, periphery and semi-periphery, structural transformation or cumulative causation, recognizing the asymmetric configuration of the European integration process or the uneven and dependent trajectories of development, and the renewed interest in industrial policy and the stateâs role, which was magnified by ongoing crises.\n\nMethodologically, it will embrace conceptual elaboration, probing and expanding the concept of periphery and peripheralization, research-oriented lectures and problem-based explorations. Lectures provide fundamental theoretical content; the laboratory component contextualizes the applicability and the limits of the theoretical concepts, revising them in an open-ended process, challenging the students with problematic situations, case-studies inquiry and critical assessment of public responses on a group work basis. Sessions devote to discussion of research projects will encourage students to present their on-going research and receive feedback from specialists and other participants. The reading materials will be previously delivered to the students.\n\nThe Political Economy of the European Peripheries Summer School 2022 - Varieties of Peripheralization is aimed at Master and PhD students, or young researchers in an early stage of their careers. Participants will have the opportunity to engage with leading scholars and peers, through work and discussion in groups, and to present and discuss their own research and their research papers. Informal moments of conversation will be promoted.
