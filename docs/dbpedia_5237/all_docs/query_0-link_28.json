        "text": "Rob Babcock described himself as a bit of a risk taker in his new position as the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and he certainly lived up to his billing in the National Basketball Association draft last night.\n\nArmed with the eighth pick overall, Babcock raised more than a few eyebrows when he selected Rafael Araujo, an unheralded 6-foot-11, 290-pound centre who played at Brigham Young University for the past two seasons.\n\n\"He's got good stats, he's got good experience, he's got a great feel for the game for his age and he is a centre,\" Babcock said of the 23-year-old native of Brazil.\n\n\"And we really need a big, strong centre, and this is a very strong centre who will not back down from anybody.\"\n\nIt was a bold move by Babcock in his first major decision since taking over as the Raptors' GM on June 7. But it wasn't necessarily a popular selection, judging from the early returns.\n\nAt a party the Raptors threw for several thousand season-ticket holders on the floor of the Air Canada Centre, there were more than a few who booed when Araujo's name was announced as Toronto's pick.\n\nBabcock got a similar reception when he was introduced to the gathering.\n\nWith the 39th pick, in the second round, the Raptors selected 6-foot-10, 223-pound Spanish centre Albert Miralles, who played last season in Italy.\n\nAccording to a team source, the Raptors were involved in trade talks with Miami in which Miralles would be sent to the Heat in exchange for Pape Sow, a 6-foot-10, 250-pound forward from Cal State Fullerton. Sow was selected by Miami with the 47th pick.\n\nBabcock, who plugged a hole in Toronto's undersized front line by choosing Araujo -- the rookie is the fourth heaviest Raptor of all time -- later pleaded for patience from the Toronto basketball fans.\n\n\"All I expect from the fans is that they have an open mind and that they give not only Rafael Araujo, but myself, the new coach and everybody an opportunity to prove that we're not just talking words,\" Babcock said.\n\n\"We're going to get out and do what we plan to do, and that's play basketball the right way.\"\n\nMost of the other players the Raptors were said to be interested in heading into the draft had already been snapped up by the time their turn arrived.\n\nSwingman Ben Gordon of the National Collegiate Athletic Association champion Connecticut Huskies was taken No. 3 by the Chicago Bulls, while point guard Devin Harris from Wisconsin was chosen No. 5 by the Washington Wizards, who then shipped him to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe Orlando Magic, who held the top pick overall, selected 6-foot-11 forward Dwight Howard from Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, making him the third high-school player in the past four years to receive top billing at the event.\n\nEmeka Okafor, the 6-foot-10, shot-blocking forward who teamed with Gordon at Connecticut, was chosen No. 2 by the expansion Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nStill on the board when it was the Raptors' turn were a couple of highly touted high-school prospects, forward Josh Smith and guard J. R. Smith, along with NCAA player of the year Jameer Nelson, a point guard from St. Joseph's.\n\nBut Babcock decided to overlook youth and potential for a more experienced hand, Araujo, who he believes will be able to make substantial contributions right away.\n\nHe said Araujo's rugged style reminds him a bit of Rick Mahorn or Brad Miller.\n\n\"He does a lot of the dirty work,\" Babcock said. \"He sets the picks, gets loose balls, an enforcer inside, keeps people off the post. Definitely, he's not overly athletic, he's not a shot blocker. He's a bread-and-butter type player.\"\n\nAraujo split his four-year collegiate career between Brigham Young and Arizona Western, a junior college.\n\nIn his final two seasons at BYU, he averaged 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds a game and was a member of the Brazilian national team that participated at the 2002 world championship in Indianapolis, Ind.\n\n\"My idol always was Karl Malone,\" Araujo said. \"I've always loved his game. He's a big, tough guy, he plays tough defence, he has a nice shot, nice range. That's really important for me. I always saw a lot of myself in him.\"\n\nBabcock admitted that Araujo will not exactly be a household name to Toronto basketball fans. In some mock drafts, Araujo barely ranked in the top 20."
