        "text": "When Rob Babcock was fired, if he know that losing Vince Carter was either a certainty, or a likely possibility, why on earth did he pass on drafting Andre Iguodala? I recall in the wake of passing on Iguodala, the reason given was that the Raptors had Vince Carter. But if Babcock knew that we might lose Carter, this reason vanishes! Thanks, Eli A: Rob had only been on the job a few weeks and hadn’t been involved in any pre-draft workouts – and Vince’s desire to leave was not obvious on draft night – and Rob took the advice of people like Jack McCloskey, who thought Araujo was the best choice."
