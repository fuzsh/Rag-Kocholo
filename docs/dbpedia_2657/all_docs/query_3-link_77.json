        "text": "Notorious French werewolf of the Dôle area of France-Comté during the sixteenth century and a classic instance of lycanthropy. Following an epidemic of attacks on young children in 1573, Garnier and his wife were arrested and tried as werewolves. Garnier confessed that he had killed a 12-year-old boy and was about to eat his flesh but was interrupted by villagers. Garnier and the villagers testified that Garnier appeared in human form, although in other instances it was claimed that he appeared as a wolf."
