        "text": "We’re awarding Italy the top spot here, not so much because of what Italian opera meant at the time but more because of what it means today.\n\nDuring the early decades of the Romantic era, many composers felt they hadn’t really “made it” unless their work appeared on the French stage. Preferably the Parisian French stage. Sung in French. In French grand opéra style.\n\nYet, thanks to some influential singers of the mid-20th century (all hail Maria Callas!), today’s opera houses are far more likely to highlight Romantic bel canto operas over any other genre of that period. (That is: Operas with loads of gorgeous singing. Sung in Italian. With memorable arias that often end with a rollicking cabaletta.)\n\nBel canto Italian operas frequently fell under the umbrellas of opera buffa or opera seria, only now comedic and dramatic plots (respectively) were thoroughly exploited through vocal pyrotechnics (see Lucia di Lammermoor’s mad scene). For modern audiences, the three indisputable kings of bel canto are Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), and Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835), all of whom excelled at sweeping bel canto melodies, though some are better known for their tragedies (*cough*Bellini*cough*) while others have gone down in history as comedic geniuses (ahem…we’re looking at you, Rossini...).\n\nBut as we’ve learned, trying to put a composer into a single box is tricky at best. Truth is, both Rossini and Donizetti produced sparkling comedies as well as gripping dramas, and poor Bellini—who tended toward the tragic end of things—died so young it’s hard to speculate on what he would’ve been able to compose in his later years.\n\nAh, Paris. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Or so the opera composers of the early 19th century thought.\n\nAs already mentioned, France—and by extension, Paris—was the de facto opera capital of Europe in the first few decades of the 1800s.\n\nThe reason? Two words: grand opéra.\n\nIn the early Romantic era, French audiences developed a taste for mammoth opera productions of epic proportions (usually inspired by historical or mythological subjects), presented in a whopping five acts with no spoken dialogue whatsoever. Those stock images of standard opera scenes with gilded costumes, extravagant sets, and a chorus of maybe 100+ people? Grand opéra is where those images began.\n\nIn short: The French were in it for the drama. Maybe even more so than the snappy tunes. In fact, French luminary Hector Berlioz (1803-1869, a pioneering composer who’s probably best known for his symphonic works, though he did manage to pen a few game-changing operas himself), once threw some very snarky shade at Italian operagoers, insinuating their interests were sort of…shall we say…basic:\n\n“Opera for the Italians is a sensual pleasure and nothing more. For this noble expression of the mind they have hardly more respect than for cooking! They want a score that, like a plate of macaroni, can be [digested] immediately without their having to think about it or even pay attention to it!” – H. Berlioz\n\n(Ouch.)\n\nRegardless of whether French listeners were more cultured than their Italian counterparts, French grand opéra could almost always be counted on to pack houses in a big way. And musicians from miles around wanted a piece of the action. Even big Italian names like Rossini and Donizetti sought French fame with their own Italianate versions of grand opéras (debuted in Paris and sung strictly in French).\n\nPerhaps the greatest champion of the genre was a German-born composer named Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791-1864) who essentially invented the grand opéra template and whose operas Robert le Diable (Robert the Devil) and Les Huguenots (The Huguenots) represent grand opéra at its height.\n\nYet another standout composer of the period was Daniel-François-Esprit Auber (1782-1871), the man whose 1828 opera Masaniello inspired a real-life revolution and whose musical output turned public attention away from old-school opéra comique toward operas with a heavier dramatic weight with no spoken words to slow things down.\n\nYou can’t talk about Romantic opera—heck, you can’t talk about Romantic music in general—without first talking about Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827). The guy only wrote one opera, but that single work has a permanent place in the operatic canon and is still being performed the entire world over.\n\nYup. He was that good.\n\nBeyond opera, however, Beethoven is widely credited with helping jumpstart music’s Romantic era, catapulting the refined works of the Classical era into a new age of musical composition driven by passion, power, and personal struggle. (Again, this is a fairly reductive way of looking at him, but it’s true that Western music historians often consider Beethoven a transformative, transitional figure.)\n\nAll this by way of saying: Without Beethoven, we wouldn’t have what came next for German opera.\n\nBefore Beethoven, the state of Germanic opera had been dominated by a combination of Italian-language opera seria and German-language Singspiel. But after Beethoven, German operas were afforded the opportunity to explore rich Romantic themes like star-crossed love and the quest for political freedom as well as physical and psychological torture. (This is the point where we turn directly to camera and blink nervously as if we’re on “The Office.”).\n\nLike the wayward, lovelorn figures of the late-18th century “Sturm und Drang” movement, German operatic characters of this era were often abused by fate, mired in tragedy, or just plain caught up in an old-fashioned battle between good and evil, sometimes within the confines of their own mind.\n\nGothic, creepy, and occasionally supernatural (anyone order a pact with the devil in exchange for a shooting match trophy?), early German Romantic opera achieved one of its greatest successes with composer Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826) and his work Der Freischütz (“The Freeshooter”), a tale rooted in Germanic folklore that first appeared in Berlin in 1821."
