This project combined multidisciplinary approaches to materiality and homemaking to investigate how people in rural Connemara villages sustained their communities after waves of emigration. The project investigated tangible strategies of those who remained in their homes despite the often-overwhelming adversity associated with staying amidst the tumult of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nBrick by Brick: Traditional Fabrication in Present-Day Practice Preserving Historical Preservation\n\nThe project aimed to document the traditional brickmaking process by conducting interviews with master brickmakers and conducting on-site surveys at Fornace Bernasconi in Castel Viscardo, Umbria, Italy. Hand drawings and 3D models were created collaboratively with another architecture student who had received an NI internship grant.\n\nClass Tour of WWI Western Front: The Great War and Modern Memory\n\nLondon, England; Ypres, Belgium; Péronne and Verdun, France\n\nThis faculty grant provided funding for fall break travel as part of an interdisciplinary course on the First World War, entitled “The Great War and Modern Memory.” Twenty students traveled to Europe, visiting principal sites of the war and its commemoration in the United Kingdom and along the Western Front in Belgium and France, including Ypres and Verdun. Students were encouraged to think about the war from the perspective of soldiers on the front lines as they visited museums and explored the battlefields.\n\nCold War Counterinsurgencies: Britain's Small-War Strategy and Decolonization in Malaya and Kenya\n\nLondon, England\n\nThis undergraduate summer break project explored connections between the strategies and outcomes of British political and military responses to Cold War containment efforts at the end of British empire, focusing on the Malayan Emergency and the Mau Mau uprising as case studies. The project aimed at uncovering how the British understood these uprisings and developed their military strategies, studying what aspects of these conflicts should (or should not) be applied to modern military efforts. The project ultimately compared these conflicts to the development of American counterinsurgency and foreign policy, specifically in the Iraqi and Afghan conflicts.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Paul Ocobock\n\nComplexities in Prehistoric Village Life and Migration Across the Mediterranean Basin\n\nThe research aimed to investigate the linkages between the increasing social, economic, and political complexities in prehistoric village life and prehistoric migration across the Mediterranean Basin in Europe from the Early Neolithic (c. 10,000 BCE) to the Late Bronze Age (c. 1,200 BCE). This was pursued through archaeological excavation at Kissonerga-Skalia, Cyprus, where the student participated in a field project associated with the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute.\n\nCourse Development, Nazi Germany / Nazi Europe\n\nNotre Dame, Indiana\n\nThis faculty grant provided funding for the development of a history course on Nazi Germany. The course aims to go beyond the narrow histories of Germany and open the topic up to its full European dimensions.\n\nDiscovering Europe's Historic Buildings: An Architectural Restoration and Thesis Research Proposal\n\nThe student participated in the San Gemini Preservation Studies Program, a hands-on preservation initiative emphasizing the study and restoration of historic buildings.

This research formed part of a broader comparative project exploring the architecture of Spain and Mexico.\n\nDr. Sabrina C. Agarwal: Medieval Europe and Feminist Theoretical Approaches to Biographies of Past Peoples\n\nNotre Dame, Indiana\n\nThis faculty grant co-supported a visit from Dr. Sabrina C. Agarwal (UC Berkeley), a preeminent scholar of bioarchaeological research on the anthropological causes and effects of changes in human skeletons over time. During her visit, Dr. Agarwal presented a public lecture on her research on Medieval Europe and feminist theoretical approaches to biographies of past peoples, and she spoke in Meredith Chesson’s “Archaeology and Gender” course.\n\nEducational Bias in Urban Kazakhstan’s (Astana) Upper Secondary Schools\n\nAstana, Kazakhstan\n\nThis undergraduate winter break project explored the educational systems in ex-Soviet countries, investigating remnants of Soviet-era biases toward “hard” sciences. The project conducted interviews with educators and reviews of lesson plans to determine whether these biases exist in modern post-Soviet academia and industry.\n\nFaculty Advisor: David Gasperetti\n\nEugenic Perspectives: An Examination of the Doctors’ Trials at Nuremberg\n\nLondon, England\n\nFocusing on the T4 euthanasia program that systematically killed an estimated 70,000 people with disabilities and mental ilnesses in Nazi Germany, this undergraduate fall break project explored the complex relationship between the ideologies of Nazi perpetrators and America’s own eugenic beliefs. The project utilized documents in London’s Wiener Library which holds the complete records of the UN War Crimes Commission.\n\nFaculty Advisor: John Deak\n\nEvolution of the Forum: From Trajan to Hitler\n\nMunich, Germany\n\nThis undergraduate fall break project conducted a comparative study between the urban plans of Munich’s Königsplatz and the Imperial fora of Rome, specifically the Forum of Trajan, to reveal the Königsplatz’ connections to the forum typology and understand how that typology was adapted. The project aimed to understand Paul Ludwig Troost’s motivations for planning the site as he did and gain a deeper knowledge of the reasoning behind the first Nazi platz and those that followed.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Krupali Krusche\n\nExamining the Jurisdiction of International Courts\n\nThe Hague, Netherlands\n\nThis undergraduate fall break project explored the development and structure of international human rights systems, focusing on how amnesty laws preclude the threat of prosecution in non-domestic courts. The project considers the jurisdiction of the Nuremberg trials and compares its development to the International Criminal Court’s mandate, which includes crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nFighting for Neutrality: Britain’s Efforts to Maintain a Neutral Spain during WWII\n\nLondon and Cambridge, England\n\nThis undergraduate summer break project explored the uneasy neutrality of fascist Spain during World War II and the British struggles to maintain Spanish neutrality. The project studied the intersection of the reality on the ground of Franco’s Spain, contemporary British perception, and actions taken by the British government, through the use of Hoare and the SOE to prevent Spain’s entry into the Axis powers. The project aimed to serve as an example of the gap between expectations and reality in international relations, particularly during wartime.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Rev. Robert Sullivan\n\nFostering Community and Identity through Berlin’s Architecture\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nAn aging society, consistently low birth rates, and a rising influx of refugees has left the German population to consider what it means to be German, a question they have struggled to answer since the end of World War II and the rejection of Nazism. This undergraduate winter break project explored how architectural design can foster community, artistic creativity, and a sense of individual and national identity in modern Berlin. The project also employed traditional and modern German construction techniques to propose a mass-timber tower, aiming to bring Germany to the forefront of the global sustainability movement.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Kim Rollings\n\nGerman Translation of “Thomas Mann’s War: Literature, Politics, and the World Republic of Letters”\n\nNotre Dame, Indiana\n\nThis faculty grant aided in funding the German translation of the book Thomas Mann’s War: Literature, Politics, and the World Republic of Letters. The book focuses on the WWII-era US exile of the German author Thomas Mann and on the ways in which US audiences kept alive (and ultimately shaped) an image of “genuine German culture” during the Nazi period.\n\nGreek Antiquities\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nThis undergraduate spring break project followed the footsteps of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, two famous eighteenth century British architects, in understanding Greek architecture. This project compared the approaches, notes, and sketches of Stuart and Revett with those of the researcher, taken in twenty-first century Athens.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Alessandro Pierattini\n\nGreek Dealings with Death and the Potential Clinical Application\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nThis undergraduate winter break project explores the question of how to best discuss and process death and dying in a clinical setting, studying how different cultural traditions deal with this process. The project focuses on Ancient Greek culture in conversation with previous research on Irish culture.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Christopher Stevens\n\nHistoric Fashion Empirical Research Trip to London, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Bath, UK\n\nLondon, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Bath, England\n\nThis faculty grant provided funding for an excursion to England as part of the Historic Fashion Research course in the FTT theatre curriculum. The trip offered undergraduate students the unique opportunity to conduct empirical research on historical fashion at renowned archives and report their findings in written essays and oral presentations.\n\nHolocaust Education in London Primary Schools\n\nThe student's research project centered on the memory of the Holocaust in Europe, particularly in England. The project engaged with the concepts of Memory and Remembering by exploring how the Holocaust is represented in contemporary English education. This research contributed to the debate on how young children should learn about the Holocaust and whether such education can be meaningful (Karayianni, 2020). The student gathered information directly from stakeholders in the English education system to understand how wider cultural conceptions of the Holocaust are created.\n\nThis knowledge was especially important in light of documented misconceptions held by secondary school students in England about their country’s responses to the Holocaust, such as the beliefs that England entered the war to stop the Holocaust, provided safe haven to numerous refugees, or did not know about the Holocaust until after the war (Haward, 2020). The fact that government sources often promoted these misconceptions only exacerbated these pervasive myths. By examining how students are exposed to the Holocaust at early stages of their education, the research aimed to dismantle these falsely-held beliefs and inform decisions about Holocaust education throughout the educational timeline in England, fostering a more accurate collective memory of the Holocaust.\n\nThe student’s previous coursework, which engaged with cultural depictions and perceptions of Jewish identity in contemporary Russian film, provided a foundation for this project. This research added to the understanding of Holocaust representation in the English-speaking world.\n\nWebsite\n\nHow Do Intergenerational Influences Shape Youth Activism Against Authoritarian Regimes\n\nThe student traveled to Turkey to conduct interviews and participant observations on intergenerational transmission and change, and how they influence youth activism and the political outcomes of anti-authoritarian struggle. The student interviewed both youth and parents to uncover their thoughts on youth movements. The project seeks to uncover the risk assessments that youth make before joining protests. The Bogazici student movement in Turkey can provide us with valuable insight into intergenerational transmission and change and how those shape the anti-authoritarian struggle.\n\nIdentity Formation and Mobility of Zazaki Speakers in Germany, Austria, and Turkey\n\nHessen and Berlin, Germany; Vienna, Austria\n\nThis graduate student project explored how community-building takes place among minority migrant populations—spatially and temporally—in relation to the already existing communities in the urban places where migrants settle. The project focused on identity formation from a relational and performative perspective through the lens of place-making, language use and retention, and religious practices among the Zazaki diaspora in Europe and western Turkey. The project sought to answer what the dynamics of identity formation, maintenance, and performance are, and how these Zazaki speakers negotiate and produce/reproduce their identities as shaped by their environment.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Maurizio Albahari\n\nIllustrations & Documentations of Ancient Greece\n\nOlympia, Greece\n\nThis undergraduate spring break project followed in the footsteps of the authors of Ionian Antiquities, a landmark architectural book studying Classical Greek art and architecture, to produce a collection of the researcher’s own sketches and documentation. The project placed these sketches in conversation with ideas from Italian engraver Giovanni Piranesi, considering the power of nature over human structures and highlighting this struggle in Greek architecture.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Lisa Lombardi-LoGiudice\n\nImagined Insurgencies and Heroic Masculinity in Chartist Fiction\n\nLondon, England\n\nThis graduate student project analyzed texts within newspaper publications associated with the Chartist political movement, the largest working-class political movement in nineteenth-century literary studies. The project compiled publications from the British Library’s British Newspaper Archive, seeking to make an original contribution to a subject with growing interest in the scholarly community.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Yasmin Solomonescu\n\nImagining an Age of Revolution? Interpretations of the American Revolution in the Italian States (1765-1799)\n\nNaples, Italy; Monticello, Virginia\n\nThis graduate student project investigated the creation of the “Age of Revolution”—how and when people started thinking they were living in such an age and how the idea of an “age” was constructed in the first place. Taking case studies of the American revolution and the Jacobin Triennium in the Italian States, the project observed how interpretations of revolutionary events changed over the course of the eighteenth century. The project argued that the French Revolution introduced this radically new notion of “revolution”—revolution as a radical break from the past and an occasion to establish a new, truly egalitarian and democratic society—and thereby reframed the narratives of revolution in Europe and the Americas.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Patrick Griffin\n\nInside Campus Rütli: Successful Educational Integration for Immigrants\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nMore than one-fifth of Germany’s inhabitants are foreign-born or children of immigrants, yet Germany’s educational system often fails to integrate children with these backgrounds. Campus Rütli was founded in 2008 by the government of Berlin to address these growing civil disturbances and disadvantages in the highly diverse district of Neukölln. This undergraduate winter break study sought to better understand Campus Rütli’s policies of immigrant assimilation through education, revealing what is effective in dealing with the social, economic, and local repercussions of hyper-diverse migrant communities.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Steffen Kaupp\n\nInside the Mind of Schinkel\n\nBerlin and Potsdam, Germany\n\nOne of the most prominent architects of German history, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841) had incredible influence on the neoclassical architecture of Berlin and Europe. This undergraduate winter break project examined how Schinkel’s design process changed before and after his travels through Italy to understand his approach and fill a gap in scholarship on the topic.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Krupali Krusche\n\nLearning and Legality: Fritz Bauer and the Frankfurt-Auschwitz Trial\n\nFrankfurt, Wiesbaden, and Bonn, Germany\n\nThe Frankfurt-Auschwitz Trial (1963-1965) was designed to force all West German citizens to face their own complicity with the Nazi criminal system, but in reality failed to present the Holocaust as anything but a summation of individual crimes committed for individual reasons. This graduate student project examined the place of the Frankfurt-Auschwitz Trial in post-war Germany’s evolving relationship with domestic law. The project’s archival research informed a dissertation on the same subject.\n\nFaculty Advisor: John Deak\n\nLiberal Kingship: Archduke Maximilian Legacy in the Habsburg Empire\n\nThe student traveled to Trieste and Vienna to conduct archival research on the life of Maximilian. The research seeks to place Maximilian into the liberal tradition of the Habsburg Empire, serving as a liberal alternative to the more conservative Emperor Franz Joseph. Much of the historiography on Maximilian has been focused on his role in the Second Mexican Empire, and his role in shaping liberal Central Europe has been largely ignored. This project seeks to fill that gap and shed light on how Maximilian’s life provides insight into the development of liberalism in Central Europe and beyond.\n\nWebsite\n\nLondon: “The Exhibit”\n\nLondon and Oxford, England\n\nThis undergraduate fall break project investigated the ethical, social, and political issues surrounding public displays of human remains in museums, focusing on museums in London. The project considered how London preserves and celebrates its history, including the issues of the past, and explored London as a setting for a film screenplay in which the research would be used.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Christine Becker\n\nMaking Places for People: The French Public Market and Urban Revitalization in America\n\nParis, Rouen, and Honfleur, France\n\nSince the 10th century when the legendary Market Les Halles was founded, the tradition of the public market has been an essential part of French Culture. This undergraduate winter break project consisted of a study of French market halls to better understand their role in French society and the design factors that encourage community, with the goal of contributing the findings to urban revitalization in America.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Lucien Steil\n\n“Maradona è Napoli'': A Visual Ethnography of Diego Maradona on the Streets of Naples\n\nThe anthropology senior honors thesis explored the pervasive imagery of Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona within the city of Naples, Italy, examining the historical and socio-political influences shaping the city's identity and memory. Through visual anthropology, the study documented and analyzed various forms of visual culture in Naples, such as murals, statues, and public art, investigating their significance in the urban landscape and residents' interactions with them. Combining written text and a photographic essay, the project produced a visual ethnography, merging anthropological research with visual documentation.\n\nWebsite\n\nMary Shelley and the Spectre of Pandemic: The Origins and Development of Post-Apocalyptic Political Thought in European Plague Literature\n\nUnited Kingdom; Italy\n\nThis faculty grant aided in funding two major research trips to Europe that were delayed or reconceived due to the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, Eileen Hunt retooled her research and reoriented her study of Mary Shelley toward the relevance of the author’s global plague novel The Last Man (1826) for both the development of post-apocalyptic literature and the political theory and social science of pandemics. Hunt’s book on this topic is titled Mary Shelley and the Spectre of Pandemic: How Her Plague Journals Generated the Uncanny Predictions of Post-Apocalyptic Fiction.\n\nWebsite\n\nMeaning at Mealtime in Renaissance Florentine Dining Culture\n\nRome and Florence, Italy; London, England\n\nThis undergraduate spring break project examined the interdisciplinary discussion concerning the historical, cultural, and theological aspects of dining by researching the dining culture and rituals of early-Middle Renaissance Florence. The project focused on the “non-sensorial” nature of meals, studying the physical objects, namely cutlery and dining ware, that fostered authentic depth in a typical Renaissance Florentine meal.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Francesca Bordogna\n\nNorms, Balancing, and U.S.—Soviet Litigation During the Cold War\n\nWashington, District of Columbia\n\nThis graduate student project investigated high profile instances of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, questioning why the US chose to litigate some of these incidents while leaving others to be resolved politically. The project generated a journal article on the causal logic behind the litigation attempts, and afterward the research served as the basis for a book project on the diplomatic history of these events. The project sought to advance scholarship on the politics of the early Cold War in Eastern Europe, demonstrating how the string of attempts at international litigation initiated by the US in the 1950s reveals a presidential administration attempting to use law as a bargaining tactic in the European theater.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Emilia Justyna Powell\n\nParis, Visual Capital: Cinema, Photography, Media. How Paris Was Invented by its Images\n\nParis, France\n\nThis faculty grant supported a course taught in the Notre Dame Summer Study Abroad Program in Paris, “Paris, Visual Capital: Cinema, Photography, Media.” The course examined the convergence of historical and societal factors in select films, photography, and novels. It discussed how works of visual art require readers, listeners, and viewers to adopt a different stance toward visual text and how this is textually a political statement. The course included discussions and on-site meetings with guest speakers.\n\nPassenger Maritime Terminal in Oslo\n\nOslo, Norway\n\nThis Master's thesis project designed and proposed an alternative version of Oslo’s existing port design, particularly its main passenger terminal, that highlights the robust and intimate historical relationship Norway has with the sea. The project sought to combine traditional and contemporary Scandinavian design styles to meld human-made objects with the natural landscape of the area. The project aimed at designing a plan which could transform the port area into a new marine communication hub close to the beautiful northern landscapes epitomized by Oslo.\n\nPolitical Movements at German Universities Following the Napoleonic Wars\n\nWürzburg and Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany\n\nThis graduate student project studied the effects of broader political movements at German universities, specifically how these universities interacted with the administration in the decades following the Napoleonic wars. The project focused on the ways in which students at southern German universities grappled with questions of German identity and responded to state-building efforts and major events, including the reconstruction of Germany following the Napoleonic wars. The project sought to contribute to existing scholarship on political movements’ effects on German universities, which primarily focus on the 1930s-1940s.\n\nFaculty Advisor: John Deak\n\nPostcolonial Paris: Contemporary French Cultures in Literature and the Arts\n\nParis, France\n\nThis faculty grant supported a course taught in the Notre Dame Summer Study Abroad Program in Paris, “Postcolonial Paris: Contemporary French Cultures in Literature and the Arts.” The course concentrates on the ways contemporary “French” cultures are reconsidered and redefined by writers and artists from outside France. The course explores novels by immigrants and second-generation immigrants, critical articles and book chapters by contemporary scholars and politicians, films, and cultural events including a ballet at the Opéra Garnier.\n\nPost-War Recovery in Montenegro\n\nMontenegro\n\nThe student's work encompassed both peripheries and memory and remembering, with a specific focus on Montenegro. Montenegro's ambiguity as a country rarely discussed in conversations about the war intrigued the student. They noted the scarcity of sources written since Montenegro's independence in 2006, both in English and Montenegrin.\n\nTheir research delved into the politics of memory, exploring how Serbian/Russian and American/EU influences exerted different pulls on Montenegro. This exploration aimed to shed light on Montenegro's viewpoints, often unknown to the outside world, and to examine how these influences shape the country's narrative and memory of historical events.\n\nWebsite\n\nPresentation and Representation: In Search of the Pathos Inside the Modern and Contemporary Architecture of Spain\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nThis undergraduate summer break project studied spatial arrangement, material application, and tinctorial architecture—three main aspects of modern architecture. The project focused on sites that represented the most important architectural and design approaches of Spanish modernism.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Selena Anders\n\nPreserving Italian Unreinforced Masonry Churches\n\nTrento, Vicenza, and Perugia, Italy\n\nThis undergraduate summer break project analyzed the seismic vulnerability of unreinforced masonry buildings. The project collected data on the structural integrity of over seventy-five medieval Catholic churches and prepared protection and intervention plans for these church parishes to promote public safety and preserve important components of Italian culture and heritage.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Kevin Walsh\n\nPrimo Levi’s Cultural Background: Between Literature and Jewish Tradition\n\nNotre Dame, Indiana; Turin and Rome, Italy\n\nThis graduate student project examines the life and works of Primo Levi, an Italian Holocaust survivor and a prominent international post-war intellectual figure, specifically how intertextuality influenced Levi’s writing. The project asked why so many international authors are present in Levi’s work and what role this intertextuality plays, focusing on constant Shakespearean references throughout Levi’s works and thought. The preliminary research of this project investigated Primo Levi’s education and encounters with this international literary culture.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Christian Moevs\n\nPrinting and Arthuriana in Europe\n\nMainz, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; Paimpont, France\n\nThis undergraduate spring break project investigated the history of printing and bookmaking and gathered visual reference material from early printers. The project explored the different approaches that these printers took to binding, the combination of word and image, and the relationship between a book’s content and form from examples located in the Mainzer Minipressen-Archiv and the Plantin-Moretus Museum.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Amy Mulligan\n\n“Profil 14-18”: A Web Documentary on the Experiences of the First World War\n\nParis, France\n\nThis faculty grant supported the completion and outreach campaign of a web documentary entitled “Profil 14-18,” created by Olivier Morel in collaboration with TV5-Monde. The web documentary explored the stories of seventeen people of various nationalities engaged in the First World War.\n\nWebsite\n\nRe-Building Post-War Experimental Housing Estates of the 20th Century\n\nLondon, England\n\nThis undergraduate spring break project studied London’s social housing blocks, some of Europe’s most successful and innovative housing of its kind, to create a comprehensive pattern book of design techniques and elements employed in the rebuilding of London. The project focused on a typological analysis of British social housing from 1960 to 1980 and sought to identify the elements in planning and design that made these neighborhoods successful.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Selena Anders\n\nResearch at Bibliothèque Nationale de France on the French Foreign Legion and Cooperative Meetings\n\nParis, France\n\nThis faculty grant provided funding for research at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France on the French Foreign Legion’s activities in Latin America, a topic central to a chapter in Joshua Lund’s current book. The grant also provided the opportunity to continue a conversation with professors at the Institut des Haut Études de l’Amérique Latine (Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris 3) about a range of cooperative endeavors, including research, publishing, and graduate student exchange.\n\nReviving Tradition: The Cultural Arts Center in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nThe student's thesis project for a Cultural Arts Center in Zagreb, Croatia, strongly connected to the research priority of \"Memory and Remembering.\" The project aimed to understand how cultural heritage, history, and identity are remembered, preserved, and passed on to future generations. The ethnographic museum within the center served as a repository of cultural memory, displaying traditional costumes and artifacts significant to the lifestyles of various Croatian regions, thereby preserving these elements for future generations.\n\nSimilarly, the performance theater, curated for traditional Croatian folk dance, functioned as a living memory of the nation's cultural legacy. Another goal of the project was to reinstate the style and tradition of the historic Trg Bana Jelačića, preserving the memory and historical significance of the square as a place of cultural and societal importance.\n\nAdditionally, the project addressed the impact of globalization on Croatian culture, which risks overshadowing or marginalizing traditional cultures.
