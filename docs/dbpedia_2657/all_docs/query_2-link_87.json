        "text": "ANNA GARNIER: JULY-AUGUST 2017 / EUROPEAN MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIPS – V60 1500m, 5000m & 800m / DOUBLE GOLD\n\n“I was quite a late starter – I’d always gone running, but I never ran.”\n\nIf Anna Garnier arrived at the running scene late, she has more than made up for it since. Having set out in 2005, her illustrious career has so far seen her bank over 400 races, including more than 100 parkruns, over 30 Surrey League appearances, and four international championships. Clearly, Garnier got the ‘bug’. And the reasons why are clear to see. Having grown up playing and loving sport – lacrosse in particular – Garnier is naturally fast, constantly fit, and fiercely competitive. Running was an easy fit. All it needed was a serendipitous moment of introduction, which came, of all places, at a wine-tasting event, where Garnier happened across Saltire Michael Johnson. “He kept on about this bloody running club, and eventually he said to me, would you like to do a race? And I said I’ll have a go. So I signed these forms and I didn’t even bother to read them. But it turned out they were the joining Thames forms!” From here, Garnier burst onto the Thames scene, becoming a regular fixture at club runs and races. Before long, she was giving the younger athletes a run for their money. “I would always be training with people who were much younger than me, so I was always trying really, really hard, erring on the side of busting it.”\n\nWhile Garnier’s committed training set her on a steady trajectory of improvement, it wasn’t until she travelled to Denmark for the 2017 European Masters that she truly converted her dedication into a cash cow for success. Having competed at several European and World Championships before, Garnier was no stranger to international competition. And yet in her previous indoor and cross country internationals, she’d barely brushed shoulders with the podium – attending for the atmosphere and the camaraderie more than for a chance at success. All of this meant that Garnier approached her 1500m, 5000m and 800m in Denmark in blissful ignorance of her competition and her chances. All of that changed, however, as the gun went for Garnier’s first event: the 1500m. Any plans to stay in the pack went quickly out of the window, as Garnier’s competitors fell into step behind her. Forced to lead, Garnier felt the danger of the pack tracking her all of the way, never far behind and always waiting to pounce. As the bell went, Garnier held her nerve, biding her time for the perfect moment to kick. But it wasn’t until the final bend, with 150m to go, that the time was right. The group was upon her, and the two Germans, Rita Schubert and Roswita Schlachte, were snapping at her heels. But drawing from her bank of hard winter training, Garnier landed a perfect finish; digging in and driving hard to finish only seconds ahead of the chasing German athletes. And so, the first gold was hers.\n\nOnly three days later, Garnier was back on the track and ready to take on the 5000m. Having been warned about the speed and strength of Sweden’s Lubov Pospeshina, Garnier carried a belly of nerves as well as tired legs into the race. And yet, all of that fell away once the race was underway. Finding herself once again at the front of the pack, as the race wore on Garnier’s lead only seemed to be increasing. With no sign of the dangerous Pospeshina, Garnier ran a lonely race – ticking off laps and yet never letting up. Finally crossing the line with nearly a 10-second lead, Garnier completed a stylish double.\n\nOnly a few days later, Garnier also took on the 800m, claiming a mighty 4th place in spite of fatigue and a lack of devoted 800mtraining. It was a worthy ending to Garnier’s very successful European campaign – and perhaps a marker of unfinished business, as Garnier continues to compete in her British vest.\n\nW60 1500m\n\nAnna Garnier Great Britain 5:46.93\n\nRita Shubert Germany 5:47.54\n\nRoswita Schlachte Germany 5:51.02\n\nLilly Wizen Sweden 5:54.47\n\nEva Lonnqvist Sweden 6:09.42\n\nPhyllis Mary Hand Great Britain 6:26.51\n\nDagmar Kleinemeyer Germany 6:35.8\n\nThames Hare and Hounds was formed in 1868 making it the oldest adult cross-country club in the world. It was founded by members of the Thames Rowing Club at Putney whose members were looking for an activity to keep themselves fit during the winter months and so emerged from the water and made the short journey up Putney Hill to Roehampton and Wimbledon Common. Anna Garnier has been THH Women's Captain. She also runs for Hercules Wimbledon as well as Vets AC of which she is President."
