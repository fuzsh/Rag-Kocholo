This new course is meant to serve as an alternative to the traditional studio instruction in the major, thus allowing students who are curious about architecture to experience it without the demands and commitment of major courses. If a student decides to transfer into the architecture major later on, they will meet with the architecture minor lead advisor to jointly propose a planned course of study that addresses any missing credits and foundational skills required for successful completion of the architecture major. This foundational course proposes a combination of readings, class discussions and research that will be used to inform the design process. Field trips will initiate students into the act of seeing by challenging them to observe, interpret and critically engage with the built environment (\"the site\") and those who are affected by it (\"the stakeholders\") in specific scalar and temporal contexts.\n\nCredit 3 units.

We drew even before we could write. It is an integral part of a design process and foundational to how we navigate the digital world. This course will explore all these aspects of drawing and its role in today's culture. It is a hands-on course that allows students to explore and experiment with a variety of representational media, including freehand drawing, rendering, and digital drawing. An emphasis will be put on drawing as a way of searching for and discovering design solutions. The majority of the drawings produced will not be ends in themselves as finished products; rather, drawing will serve as a process-driven medium for exploring new ideas and design solutions.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 303C Unveiling the Detail: A Lesson in Forensic Drawing & Discovery\n\nThis course will explore architectural detailing from the quotidian to the sublime to posit architectural design intent.

Students will be asked to carefully observe their own constructed environment and architectural precedents to understand the truth and fiction in construction. This course seeks to help students understand the role of the architectural detail in articulating and reinforcing architectural concepts. It will strengthen the student's understanding of material properties, opportunities and limitations, construction sequencing, and design execution. Students will gain a new appreciation for the exquisitely executed architectural detail and strengthen the skill to anticipate and navigate detailing challenges in their own design work.

Using St. Louis as the starting point, this course takes students out of the classroom and into a variety of neighborhoods -- old, new, affluent, poor -- to look at the built environment in a variety of contexts and through a variety of lenses. Almost every week for the first half of the semester, students visit a different area of the city, with each trip highlighting some theme or issue related to the built environment. These include topics such as architecture, planning, American history, investment and disinvestment, community character and values, race, transportation, immigrant communities, and future visions. Running parallel to this, students will be involved in an ongoing relationship with one particular struggling neighborhood, in which students will attend community meetings and get to know and become involved with the people of the community in a variety of ways. Students learn to look below the surface and beyond the single obvious story for multiple stories to discover complexity, contradictions and paradoxes. They also come to consider the complex ways in which architecture and the built environment can affect or be affected by a host of other disciplines. College of Architecture and College of Art sophomores, juniors, and seniors have priority. Students will add themselves to the wait list and will be administratively enrolled in the course.

The ubiquity of computers in design, studio art, communications, construction, and fabrication demand that professionals become comfortable with their use. It is also important in a group of ever-specializing fields that one know how to translate between different software and output platforms. This comfort and the ability to translate between platforms allow contemporary artists and designers to fabricate with ever-increasing freedom and precision. This course will introduce students to 3D software with a focus on 2D, 3D, and physical output. Through a series of projects, students will learn to generate work directly from the computer and translate it into different types of output. Starting from first principles, this course will cover the basics from interface to output for each platform used. This course will also familiarize students with a range of CNC technology and other digital output for both small- and large-scale fabrication. The course will be broken into three projects. In the first project, students will focus on computer-generated geometry and control systems. In the second part, students will generate physical output and line drawings. The final project will focus on rendering, context, and cinematic effects. The software covered in this course includes, but is not limited to Rhinoceros 3D, Maya, Illustrator, Photoshop.

Starting from first principles, this course begins with the basics from interface to output for each platform used, developing skills in digital modeling and physical output and serving as a prerequisite for more advanced courses in design scripting and digital fabrication. Students will complete a semester-long project divided into three assignments, beginning with developing a detailed digital model of a formal precedent, which introduces students to basic skills in modeling with nurbs, subdivision surfaces, and meshes. Continuing to develop a clear diagrammatic organization and hierarchy, students will expand the characteristics of their original formal precedent using Grasshopper to create a set of dynamic, flexible behaviors. Drawing upon their initial understanding and analysis of organizational systems within their formal object, students will transfer their observations into the construction of a spatial parametric model that has potential to serve structure, fabrication methods, and material assembly. Finally, students will develop their digital model into a geometrically rationalized material system that draws upon their initial precedent, producing a physical model, renderings, and 2d drawings presented in the format of a final review.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 326K Digital Evolutions: Parametric Design for a Fabricated Species\n\nDigital Evolutions will introduce digital modeling, parametric workflow, and fabrication techniques in a variety of two and three-dimensional media to document the imagined development of a hypothetical animal species. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in design scripting and digital fabrication, this course will introduce each technique at a foundational level giving every student a new arsenal of digital tools with which they can act as evolution's (intelligent) designer. Students will begin with an analysis of drawings by Ernst Haeckel (1843-1919), a German biologist, naturalist, philosopher, and artist who promoted and popularized Charles Darwin's work in Germany, but whose own alternative theories of evolution have subsequently been discredited. Students will use Grasshopper and associated plug-ins to exploit the powerful flexibility of parametric design to iteratively adapt these studies to various imagined environmental conditions. Working in pairs, students will crossbreed their species, synthesizing ideas concerning skin, support systems, pattern, and kinetics, finally modeling this fictitious entity with a geometrically rationalized material system-a fabricated fabrication.\n\nCredit 3 units.

How have they influenced the culture of architectural representation? Why should the gaming perspective view and level structure be considered essential elements for contemporary architectural theory? How is video game theory instrumentalized in the creation of architecture? To begin, video game engines are becoming ubiquitous features in architectural rendering culture. Platforms like Unreal, Unity, and Twinmotion offer designers tools to create environments that can be explored and interacted with in real time by the user-client. Although 3D modeling, rendering, and animation platforms have been commonplace in architecture schools and experimental studios since the 1990s, accessible, interactive, real-time rendering platforms are a more recent and less studied phenomenon. The architecture of level design and the companion art of worldbuilding constitute a new representational paradigm. In this seminar, we will examine the spatial structures of contemporary gaming titles and explore a series of historical and theoretical texts from Video Game Studies. The final assignment will be project-based and designed using the Unreal Engine.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 326Q Evolution of a Section: Architecture and Machine Learning\n\nThroughout human history, architecture was seen as static, a quality attributed to its inherent physicality. This seminar encourages students to conceive of an architecture, through the medium of an architectural section, that mutates across space and time. Using Machine Learning processes, the class intends to propose an alternative and nonlinear means of production to the linear process of architectural design from conception to construction. Machine learning engages graphic information differently than designers do. All fidelity towards visual, cultural, political, and geometrical context is lost, resulting in a new class of compositions that are unique but not critical. The systems, including Generative Adversarial Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Diffusion Models, are explored with input (images/texts) and analyzed as output images. We will collectively conjecture on how to 'train' the AI models to understand spatial features typical of an architectural section. We will rely on the rich history of architectural sections, across time, styles, and media, to inform the potential trajectories that our section follow. The works of contemporary artists and architects, like Matias Del Campo, Gabriel Esquivel, Helena Sarin, Refik Anadol, etc. who work with Machine Learning technologies, will be analyzed to understand approaches towards AI and Design.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 327D Digital Lighting Design: Rapid Prototyping and the CNC\n\nStudents in this course will develop an intimate understanding of CNC technology and its ability to rapidly prototype and fabricate within an iterative design process. Through an accelerated feedback loop, the class will work quickly through maquettes, renderings, prototyping, and fully formed products multiple times within the semester. Lectures will include both current and historic approaches to lighting design to better inform the initial drawing process. This course will also include technical instruction on CNC, processes specific to the equipment at Sam Fox. Coursework will culminate in an exhibition of lighting displays and relevant documentation to accompany the research.

After all, color is a major design element that alone has the power to transform a space. Color ignites the imagination, holding the potential to elevate being in a space into an emotional experience. In this design seminar, students will investigate the use of color in architecture and spatial practices. Architectural practitioners and artists - from Josef & Anni Albers, Luis Barragán, Hélio Oiticica, Bridget Riley, James Turrell, Olafur Eliasson, James Casebere, Bruce Nauman, and others - will be the subject of a number of case studies. Short weekly lectures will be presented on selected topics and concepts such as color theory, simultaneous contrast, perception and optical mixing of color, use of artificial and natural light, interactive effects and relationships of colors, color as a prominent compositional and spatial element, environmental influence on color, among others. In tandem with the lectures, students will work on a small series of independent explorations studying color and light phenomena in physical modeling, drawing, photography and digital color mapping. The goal is to inspire architecture and urban design students with the expressive and poetic qualities of color and its potential material depth.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 327X Color Systems\n\nThis course is a sustained investigation of color. Students study how color is affected by light, by space, by arrangement, by culture, and by commerce. The course aims to deepen the understanding of color's complexity and pervasiveness as a fundamental element of shared visual culture. The course develops both technical and conceptual skills to aid in visual translation. In addition to color-specific inquiry, a goal is to expand ideas of research and enable students to integrate various methods of acquiring knowledge into their art and design practice. Throughout the course, students discuss various processes of making/constructing, the connection between color/form/concept, and strategies for idea generation and brainstorming. The course allows for much individual freedom and flexibility within varying project parameters. College of Architecture and College of Art sophomores, juniors, and seniors have priority.

We will take an extended look at the dawn of the modern period during the 15th and 16th centuries through a global perspective, turning eastward from Renaissance Europe to the Ottoman, Mughal, Chinese, and Japanese empires. The great chronological and geographic span of this course will be pulled together around the themes of classicism and its subsequent reinterpretations as well as the pursuit of the tectonic ideal. Our aim is to recognize how these ideological pursuits of modern architecture evolved out of longer historical processes.

In addition to tracing the usual history of modern architecture, this course also emphasizes understanding of the formal, philosophical, social, technical, and economic background of other important architectural directions in a global context. Topics range from architects' responses to new conditions in the rapidly developing cities of the later nineteenth century, through early twentieth-century theories of perception and social engagement, to recent efforts to find new bases for architectural interventions in the contemporary metropolis.\n\nCredit 3 units. Arch: HT\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 331A Experimental Formwork\n\nOur perception of concrete is typically determined by the mold that gives it its shape and not the material itself. Given the fluidity of the material in its plastic state, the desired morphology and configuration once cured relies on its molding possibilities. During this seminar students will explore the essence of mold making, its possibilities and limitations as containers of a fluid material that will determine its final shape and surface quality. Starting from an understanding of standard molding procedures, students will explore a wide range of non-conventional formwork techniques such as flexible fabric, pneumatic, 3d printing, dynamic casting, rotoforming and others. Students will produce physical molds and cast prototypes in concrete or other materials through a process of experimentation and discovery. The ultimate goal of this course is to use formwork as an active and accessible design tool and fertile ground for innovation. Particular emphasis will be on discovering relationships between material properties and production methods as a way of finding systematic approaches that can lead to making prototypes combining digital and/or analog tools. Students are expected to develop creative processes that can be applicable to unprecedented and novel casting techniques and potentially to manufacturing methods of actual building components. The course is structured around an initial lecture about mold making precedents and possibilities, specific readings, a short research on traditional and other current -non-traditional- mold techniques and hands-on work. Students will work individually to fabricate small mold prototypes (6\" x 6\" x 6\"), cast concrete or other fluid materials readily available to perform tests and produce accurate representation of the outcomes and its process. The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nCredit 1.5 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 331B Innovative Bamboo\n\nIn this seminar we will explore bamboo as a sustainable material for innovative structures. Bamboo is a natural composite with high tensile and compression strength and grows in a cylindrical form that is optimal for carrying longitudinal forces. Furthermore, it is fast growing, sequesters more carbon than timber, produces more oxygen than a boreal forest, and even absorbs heavy metals from soil. Students will look at historic and contemporary precedence of bamboo as engineered products and as structural construction using simple poles. We will play with ways to connect, assemble, and build with this natural material. Finally, we will build large-scale models and prototypes of structural designs. The goal is to explore the wide range of design and engineering potential of this natural, often overlooked, structural grass.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 332A 1 House\n\nIn this seminar, students will research and develop designs for a completely off-the-grid \"small\" house in Boquete, Panama, for Kaylee and Jordan of the Nomadic Movement YouTube channel. With input from Kaylee, Jordan, and their crew, students will research traditional sustainable building practices in Panama and develop schematic designs for a small house to be built by them on their property in Boquete, with construction beginning in May 2021. The course will include instruction in residential design, structure, and materials and methods of construction. A subtext of the course will be entrepreneurship and beginning one's practice as an architect.

The houses -- demonstration homes for General Electric and Westinghouse, vacation houses sponsored by Women's Day and the Douglis Fir Plywood Association, and homes for clients interested in new ideas in architecture -- served as prototypes for domestic living inspired by postwar logics of mass production. The experimental homes provided opportunities to challenge norms and amplify particular design aspects through focused investigations of the potential of new materials, innovative construction systems, or provocative formal capabilities. Like the more well-known Art and Architecture magazine's Case Study House Program on the West Coast, Matsumoto's houses aspired to be functional, beautiful, and affordable while providing a model for modern American domesticity. Students in the course will undertake archival research for selected George Matsumoto-designed modern homes throughout the semester. Course work will include experimental, analytical drawings; archival research and writing; museum-level physical models; and other representations of residential work by Matsumoto. The resulting work is anticipated to be included in a future publication, an exhibition, and as a featured part of the larger research project Beauty in Enormous Bleakess: The Interned Generation of Japanese American Designers, which aspires to \"tell an urgently needed new chapter in design and architectural history that acknowledges the signal contributions of Japanese Americans to post-war culture and cultural life.\"\n\nCredit 3 units.

The main goal of this course is to critically embrace this tradition through the format of the artist's book. St. Louis is the focus for our observations because it is familiar to our everyday lives and also because it provides key situations for understanding contemporary forms of urbanity and how urban space is produced and imagined. The course bridges the curricular structures of art and architecture by enhancing the collaboration between the practical and scholarly work developed in both schools, with additional support from Special Collections at Olin Library. It combines the reading, lecture, and discussion format of a seminar with the skill building and creative exploration of a studio. This course is divided into three progressive phases of development: the first consists of weekly readings, discussion, and responses in the form of artist's books. The second phase focuses on the Derive with physical activities and assignments based on interacting directly with the urban environment. The third phase focuses on individual research, documentation, and final book design and production. College of Architecture and College of Art sophomores, juniors, and seniors have priority.

A biological system responds to the unique condition of its ecosystem; architecture responds to the unique conditions of the site. Building on this principle are the fields of biomimicry, the study of design and process in nature, and biokinetics, the study of movement within organisms, and their ability to address architectural problems with elegant, technologically advanced, sustainable solutions. Biomimicy: A Biokinetic Approach to Sustain(Able) Design focuses on kinetics as an essential element of biomimicry in the context of architecture and employs the study of the kinetic aspects of biological systems - structure, function, and movement - to inform the design and engineering of buildings. A systematic approach to researching and translating the kinetic function of organisms leads to a successful bridging of biological and architectural concepts.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 336E Biomimicry, Teleology & Organic Architecture\n\nThis seminar is intended to develop an understanding of the history and evolution of Biomimicry as a significant design tool from the emergence of Biology as a science in the early 19th century to the present. Biology was the first discipline to confront the problem of teleology, of design in nature. For the past one hundred years, biological references and ideas are present in the work of architects and in the writings of architectural theorists. Biomimicry, a term coined by Janine Benyus, has developed into a new discipline that studies well-adapted organisms designs and processes and then imitates life's genius to design human applications, aiming at a sustainable development. The intent of this seminar is to establish a systematic approach to research and analysis of the history and theory of this biological analogy and its influence on the history of environmental architecture, as seen through the lens of biomimcry. In addition to a historical analysis, students will analyze case studies that exemplify the relationship of architecture to biology, focusing not only on built work, but on the writings and the designer's positions in terms of this relationship. Classes will consist of a combination of formal lectures and facilitated discussion periods. In addition, each student will choose a particular architect and, through research and analysis, will assess the influence of biomimicry in his/her work and present these results in a paper that includes a critical analysis and a proposal on how to advance the architect's work to the highest level of biomimicry.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 337N In Detail: Observation, Drawing, & Discovery\n\nThis course explores architectural detailing from the quotidian to the sublime to posit architectural design intent. Through fieldwork and research, students will study the role of architectural detailing in the configuration and execution of architectural space making. Students will be asked to carefully observe their own constructed environment and architectural precedents to understand the truth and fiction in construction. This course seeks to help students understand the role of architectural detail in articulating and reinforcing architectural concepts. It will strengthen students' understanding of material properties, opportunities and limitations, construction sequencing, and design execution. Students will gain a new appreciation for the exquisitely executed architectural detail and strengthen the skill to anticipate and navigate detailing challenges in their own design work. Students will be asked to explore architectural details through various drawing methods, modeling, and modes of representation.

How do traditions of design and quality based on centuries of a national and regional design culture react and adapt to a global market? What is the culture of design? What is design identity? Italian design will be the primary focus of this course, followed by Japanese and Asian design & manufacturing. Case studies will include examples of industrial design, fashion design, communication design and automobile design.

In particular, the class will focus on facades that include sun shading elements, thus increasing the thickness of the assembly. Turning a corner sounds benign until you consider that all materials have thickness, and then the problem reveals itself. This too often results in an oversimplification and thus reduction of the design intent. This course will focus on designing custom facade systems using advanced digital modeling techniques and testing through physical prototypes.

Often, metal 3D printed parts are used as industrial components and engineered mechanical parts. This project will reverse that to create delicate objects that engage with skin. Students will create a parure (a set of related pieces of jewelry) that will examine the human body as an architectural site and test the potential of metal 3D printing in architecture. We will use Autodesk Maya to create hyper-articulated surfaces and employ lost wax and lost plastic metal casting, consequently blurring the line between traditional and contemporary techniques. As a result, we will not simply conceive of a project and outsource its production. Instead, we will use the foundry to provide firsthand experience with material processes. The set of pieces will share characteristics of form and geometry as well as tactics of physical interconnection with the human body, adjusting through site-specific responses to finger, wrist, neck, ear, or head. In addition to a set of renderings and drawings, students will produce wax hand-carved models and 3D-printed plastic objects for lost plastic casting. For artifacts that require fine detail, students will outsource their projects to wax 3D-printing and casting facilities.

These activities will be in dialogue with the design studio and art history courses. The intellectual framework of the course is informed by Giulo Carlo Argan's seminal work \"La storia dell'arte come storia della città\" (The history of art as the history of the city, Einaudi, 1983), presenting the city as a complex time-space phenomenology of cultural artifacts. While Florence is well known for its cultural contribution to Western cultural history during the 1400s and 1500s, little is known about the full span of its millennial history, including its contemporary developments.

The meaning of function will be debated so that students develop a definition based on their own values. Highly exaggerated, specific, or experimental works will be encouraged. Techniques for metal fabrication, simple woodworking, and mold-making will be taught in class, as needed. No previous experience is necessary. This course will benefit designers, artists, architects, and engineers, and it will explore the intersections of design and making among these fields.

The drawings, as architectural objects, configure architectural knowledge, perception and vision. We will begin by studying precedent drawings in relation to each architect's theoretical framework, project description and technique. The range of works will relate different types of construction (perspectives, axonometrics, diagrams, ideagrams, assemblages, montages, descriptive geometry, and mapping) with integral and symbiotic theoretical agendas. Each student will learn the techniques of representation in their case study and from this example construct an interpretation of a specified site in this language. With a collection of theoretical frameworks and workshops on various techniques, the class will qualify a series of sites through drawing/interpreting the shadows present. Shadows may be thought of as reductions of the real object - in this sense, the drawings will act as abstractions or reductions that promote vision. Instead of simply discussing qualities of space, narratives of metaphor, intangible phenomena, implications of constructed geometry, this architectural research project attempts to propose methods of seeing such that the representation may play a more active role in the shaping of design. This course centers on the creation of imaginative processes of representation.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 404 Advancing Integrated Sustainability\n\nDO YOU WANT TO WORK DIFFERENTLY? TOWARD MORE EFFECTIVE OUTCOMES? This course is a call to students from ALL DISCIPLINES with the conviction that it is necessary for us to WORK TOGETHER WHILE CONTRIBUTING FROM OUR SPECIFIC FIELDS OF STUDY to find solutions to challenges in our BUILT ENVIRONMENT. You will APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE BASE you acquire in this course to FORMULATING IDEAS FOR ACTUAL COMMUNITY PROJECTS in ST. LOUIS. Students will learn to INTEGRATE and APPLY a holistic range of social, economic, and technical systems inspired and optimized by models in the natural world. A foundation in natural and bio-mimetic systems will be overlaid with analysis of corporate mission, principles, and triple bottom line thinking in order to learn how to build defensible, value-based arguments for implementation of sustainable systems. With the expressed intent of achieving net positive outcomes in the built environment, the following topics will be addressed: brownfield property reuse; storm/wastewater management; urban heat island management; air quality; potable water issues and opportunities; material cycles and flows including embedded energy, emissions, toxicity, virgin vs. recycled content and waste diversion; energy efficiency and renewable energy opportunities; transportation, accessibility and mobility choices; vernacular and cultural expression; local and healthy food availability; fitness advocacy and other health issues; education; public outreach and transparency; governance; and the economics of these systems. Lectures, case studies, readings, and class discussions will support application exercises and experimental projects to propose ideas for improving the built environment at multiple scales. Assignments will be reviewed often to assist each student's learning and questions. Complementing leading edge theory with practical outcomes will be provided with the intention that students will develop valuable skills to be incorporated in their other academic projects.

What can the profession of architecture learn from these ideas? 'Topics in Architectural Entrepreneurship,' a course offered in partnership with the Skandalaris Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, offers students a chance to gain exposure to the entrepreneurial ideas that are innovating the architectural community, and begin to foster a mindset of architectural entrepreneurship that has the potential to be widely beneficial to the profession. Each week the course will welcome a guest speaker who, as the owner of a firm, or innovator of a new business proposal in the design field, would provide case studies to show students what type of entrepreneurial ideas are shifting the architectural discipline. From sustainability, to urbanization and localism, to emerging global growth engines, and the future structure of the architectural network, each lecturer will bring new insight to what it is to be an architectural entrepreneur.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 404D For Purpose: Art & Design as an Ethics-based Model of Entrepreneurship\n\nWorking from the premise that art and design have the ability to enrich and transform lives and communities in a tangible way, students will redefine social, environmental and cultural problems as opportunities. Students are encouraged to bring ideas that have the potential to address these problems through the creative processes of art and design. Students will work in teams to develop a proposal for a project, product, or service-based organization with the potential to address a specific issue. Students from will draw lessons from researching established individuals, companies and not for profit organizations that are involved in the production of culturally significant, creative work, that also supports a larger social mission and apply this research to their own proposal. Each proposal shall be developed into a business / sustainability plan that will demonstrate the value of the proposal and explain the resources required to meet specific goals. This course will introduce students to the uncertainty that is inherent in the entrepreneurial process. Students will work to develop skills to evaluate ideas in relation to their personal values, the idea's ability to address a specific problem, and the resources required to implement a sustainable solution. The process will help students to navigate the uncertainty and assess the risk associated with implementing their proposal through morphing the idea concept, seeking advice, and building a coalition of stakeholders. This course is open to disciplines outside of architecture. Students in Art, Social Work and Engineering are encouraged to register.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 404E Design: Urban Ecosystem Principles Integration\n\nIn today's world, your discipline has grand challenges whose solutions often lay in other realms. How will you train yourself to leverage the interdisciplinary partnerships required to innovatively solve and evolve in a rapidly changing world? The mission of this interdisciplinary course is to \"Advance the interrelationships of ecological and human systems toward creating a healthy, resilient, and biodiverse urban environment\", and will bring together experts and students in ecology, urban design, architecture/landscape architecture, economics, social work, and engineering, drawing from inside and outside the WU community. Building from our knowledge of ecosystem principles and function, a diverse group of leaders in their fields will provide lectures, readings, and student project leadership to understand and test Healthy Urban Ecosystems Principles among human and ecological (non-human) systems and the range of sociopolitical processes entailed with their implementation. Class content is developed by Washington University leaders in their disciplines as well as external organizations such as the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Field Museum in Chicago, and others. This course builds upon a 1-unit fall seminar (not a prerequisite) that introduces challenges and solutions to achieving healthy urban ecosystems, and provides students an opportunity to more deeply engage and manipulate the interrelationships of symbiotic urban systems and apply those concepts in multidisciplinary project applications. Projects will leverage student-defined challenges in the evolving laboratory of urban St. Louis using Healthy Urban Ecosystems Principles to develop multidisciplinary integrated solutions to challenges encountered in urban areas such as climate change and resilience, security of ecosystem services, social inequity, economic strife, and community vitality. Students will present their work in a public forum at semester's end.\n\nSame as I50 INTER D 406\n\nCredit 3 units.

Each student will design, develop and build prototypes of two tables suing the same material. One table will be the product of a systematic analysis of material qualities, production procedures and other constructivist principles. One table will be the product of more explicitly intuitive, emotional and interpretive responses to the nature of the material and its production.

Students participate in projects with on- or off-campus clients, developed with and guided by faculty advisors from across the University. Teams deliver to their clients an end-product that explores \"wicked\" problems requiring innovative methods and solutions. New and varied projects are introduced each semester. Past projects have included conducting greenhouse gas inventories for a community organization; developing a tool to screen University investments for sustainability parameters; developing a sustainability plan for a local nonprofit; addressing water savings initiatives for local breweries; and assessing the vulnerability of city sanitation systems. Team-based projects are complemented by seminars that explore problem solving strategies and methodologies drawn from a wide range of creative practices, including design, engineering, and science, as well as contemporary topics in energy, environment, and sustainability. Students will draw on these topics to influence their projects. The course is designed primarily for undergraduates, with preference given to seniors.\n\nSame as I50 INTER D 405\n\nCredit 3 units.

We will develop and employ digital and manual fabrication techniques, including casting, thermoforming, 3-D printing, laser-cutting, and CNC milling, for a semester-long design project. Students will have opportunities to work with a variety of tools in the shops and digital laboratories to develop a full-scale kinetic prototype of/for a door/window/portal/aperture system. No previous fabrication experience or expertise is required.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 407B Dynamic Materialism and Urbanism\n\nDynamic Materialism and Urbanism is a course developed for students who are interested in emerging technologies and digital production. The course develops and tests experimental design processes in architecture and digital media by enhancing 3D technologies, and it allows each student to adopt abstract thinking and making processes. This course develops digital design skills with the conceptual understanding of the transformative awareness of the artistic production of computational processes, which can inspire new forms of architectural conditions. The current developments in digital technology allow mathematical expressions to transform complex generative systems, which have shifted the formal discourse of architecture. The new digitally based techniques are being invented to inform creative processes in architecture through the manipulations of complex geometrical and topological forms. This course will focus on developing new techniques that translate these mathematical developments into diagrammatic design strategies. The generative modeling techniques will be deployed by the students for this investigation. Students will develop a complex set of massing strategies with conceptual development for defining and inventing dynamic-based architectural proposals within an urban context. Through digital modeling and mutating architectural strategies, each student will develop a transformational condition of a new emerging design. The new architectural forms are to be modeled through CAD/CAM (laser cutting) and rapid prototyping (3D printing) for physical outputs.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 407C Mixed-Reality Fabrication\n\nThe translation from digital design to physical construction has long presented challenges and opportunities for architects, engineers, technologists, fabricators and contractors. Mixed-reality is a process of overlaying virtual objects in real-world space. Wearing a HoloLens or similar assists construction workers to accurately locate the correct parts where they are needed. In lieu of using robotics, humans are already quite adaptable for different types of construction and mixed-reality enhances their skill and precision. While accuracy and efficiency are benefits to the contractor, the benefit to architects is allowing for non-standardization to be more easily incorporated in the design. The course will explore the use of mixed reality in half-scale to full-scale fabrication prototypes to understand its challenges and benefits.\n\nCredit 3 units.

However, when combined with clay, a soft, visceral material that slumps and oozes when extruded and layered, the 3D printer's tectonic language becomes highly idiosyncratic. This course will investigate the use of ceramic 3D printing for a collaborative temporary public artwork with a community partner. During the seminar, students will use Potterbot ceramic printers to explore 3D printing with clay in tandem with an investigation of the architectural frame that structures the artwork. With new materials and digital fabrication technology, we have the potential to rethink the relationship between structure and frame. Students in the course will engage in a rigorous workflow focusing on the relationship between designer, tool, material, and frame. Over the course of the semester, students will engage in a series of assignments and tutorials intended to create a strong understanding of the methods for robotic deposition and working with clay while also challenging the prominence of precision and control associated with digital fabrication technology. Central to the class discourse will be the exploration of the relationship between the highly articulated frame and the field of ceramic components, focusing on notions of authorship, precision/imprecision, loose fit, scale, and tolerance. Additional coursework will include drying and firing clay components, post-printing physical manipulation, staining and glazing techniques, clay body research, and full-scale prototyping. Proficiency in Rhino is a requirement for the course.\n\nCredit 3 units. Arch: ETH, NS\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 408J Performance Enhancing\n\nThe term Performance has many meanings that are either quantitative, qualitative, or both simultaneously through a range of design professions. The suggested goal of Performance is an optimistic enhancement to a designed entity or idea and holds the potential to be highly provocative relative to the method it is deployed when arguing for a particular design procedure or effect. The double entendre suggested by the term performance relates to both how the system technologically improves a functional aspect along with a more theatrical act of performing. Design in both architecture and fashion relies on both interpretations to create a multi-dimensional discourse necessary to advance conceptual design investigation. The seminar class will explore issues of performance of complex surfaces at the scale of the human body. The class will consist of lectures, discussions, readings, physical material manipulation, and 3D digital modeling and digital fabrication. The use of Rhino (with T-splines and / or Grasshopper) or Maya will be deployed for the digital design of the skin systems. Material systems will be explored initially through manual experimentation and then combined with the digital investigation for the final a digital fabrication using tools such as 3D printing, lasercutting, CNC milling, and thermoforming, resulting in a final garment for the human body. The class is offered to both fashion and architecture students and the investigations would occur in teams of two where ideally one from each discipline is represented.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 408M Atmospheric Animations\n\nThis course will explore the capacity of modifying perception, as a way of thinking and making in design process. We recognize the ambient complex environment base on the concept of each element in space as a figure of motion, being sensitive to a specific period of time. Each student will begin with selecting a certain way of observing, and developing a method to document and analyze a piece of dynamic perception which will then be re-constructed through drawings or models, primarily focusing on one aspect of the experience, such as material performance, light reflections, air flow, etc. Final part of the project will be representing the synthetic perception, by creating the atmospheric imagery in motion. Students will be introduced to various techniques of recording ocular perceptions with the aid of digital tools, 2D representation, 3D modeling and animation rendering throughout the course both as general workshops and individual project basis.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 408N Mapping Complex Spatial Sequences\n\nNew methods of spatial practice have changed the way architects and designers work. As designers, we are no longer tied to static, projection-based drawings as a means to develop and represent our ideas. Time based digital imaging allows us to simultaneously examine the narrative, formal, experiential and spatial aspects of a particular place. Students will map a site through digital photography focusing on a specific spatial sequence much like how a director would set up a scene, moving fluidly from one space to another. During the first half of the semester, this spatial sequence will be used to create a drawing of the entire site as one multilayered composite image with particular attention to the interaction of time, space and movement. The site will then be reconstructed digitally through models or drawings, using the composite drawing as base. Finally, relationships between the drawing and model will be outlined resulting in a more complete experiential spatial sequence.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 408P Building Performance for a Solar Powered House\n\nWe will study the state of the art of building integrated solar systems, and design such a system for a house and assess its performance using computational tools. Topics include the fundamentals of solar energy systems, energy management, and its implications to design, either passive or active approach. The course involves building performance simulations using Ecotect, Energy+, HERS, and other tools. Students will use simulation data to study the relation between design and its performance. The course will consist of lectures, review, and student projects. The course will be parallel with several Engineering courses, including ESE 437: Sustainable Energy Systems and EECE 428: Sustainability Exchange. Projects will involve teamwork with Engineering students of different backgrounds. The course will contribute to Team WUSTL solar decathlon with the following features: Energy efficiency: passive design; high performance enclosure; Net-zero energy: renewable energy; heat recovery; Sustainability: water recycle; carbon neutral; lean construction; Resilience: prefabricated house to mitigate natural disasters; Smartness: advanced sensors network; energy management; data visualization; Human-centered living adaptability: flexible space; human comfort and perception controls to operate the house to improve productivity and health; An interdisciplinary effort for renewable energy and sustainable buildings.\n\nCredit 3 units.\n\nView Sections\n\nA46 ARCH 408Q Fabricated Drawings\n\nThe course will focus on digital fabrication tools, techniques and image theory to uncover new methods of producing physical images. Images are built in a myriad of methods including physical media or from data. Physical images, as defined in the context of this seminar, will be transcend a 2D limitation to develop thickness. The increase to 2.5D or 3D opens opportunities to investigate the use of digital fabrication tools to construct images. In particular, the class will focus on the way information technology continues to have a profound effect on the way we perceive our built environment and the way we represent it. The images that surround us are becoming increasingly easy to generate through information technology. Access to technology both in terms of digital design and output affords the opportunity to reconceive the nature of images. Images are developed through analog, digital or hybrid processes. Their generation is a collaborative interaction between intuition and information processes through clearly defined rules. The scientific theoretician, Peter Galison, discusses the tension between intuition and information on the nature of images in the arts and sciences. Images reveal the intricacy of relations and knowledge, but they are simultaneous deceptive because they bypass the mathematics of pure science. The tension in the arts tends to be between the intuitive, interpretive ability of images as representation versus the image as evidence of a computation-based process. Architectural theoretician Mark Linder talks about how images in architecture are moving away from representations of something else toward a more literal and non-idealized result of a procedure. The image is literally the process of making visible the end result of an operation. Therefore, images are the evidence of the process by which they were generated. As such, the class will develop innovative processes for our digital fabrication equipment to construct images. The projects will develop new methods to use the CNC mill, laser cutters, knife plotter and 3D printer. New tools may need to be developed and built to enable the image fabrication process. In parallel with technological development is material experimentation. Students will be highly encouraged to test new materials to program their behavior and interaction with technology.\n\nCredit 3 units.

The seminar will focus on digital fabrication at the medium to large scale using a proprietary system designed by Scott Mitchell, alumni of Wash U and founder of Stud.io. The system focuses on intelligent prefabrication using custom parametric software to create a series of robotically fabricated metal studs that can be easily assembled into almost any form. The CNC machine is specifically designed to make these custom metal studs with a series of operations, promoting mass-customization.
