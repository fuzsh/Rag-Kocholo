        "text": "Research\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nRenaissance European literary and intellectual history:\n\nVernacular humanism and literature (esp. English, French, Italian)\n\nMontaigne and his reception\n\nTranslation and its relationship to wider intellectual and cultural history, including book history, cultural transmission, diplomacy, and transnational literary phenomena.\n\nLibraries and the relationship between oral, written, and printed media.\n\nTheory\n\nHistory of the modern humanities\n\nApplication of anthropological theory to literary studies (Alfred Gell)\n\nTransnational literary studies\n\nRecent and On-Going Research:\n\nI am currently developing and seeking funding and partners for a large collaborative project to produce a literary history of Europe, 1559-1648, centered on histories of literary objects and groups of objects. It aims to recover the dynamics of the transnational literary field—the itineraries, the circuits and networks traced by objects, people, forms, skills, knowledge between cities and regions across retrospectively imposed national borders. It is open to a whole range of literary objects that had a presence in social life and that are of interest to scholars in many different disciplines: words and inscriptions, texts and works, ephemeral and archival documents, manuscripts and printed books. It is interested not just in authors but in actors from publishers and readers to pedlars and players. It includes not only western and central Europe but also Scandinavia, east and southeast Europe, the Americas and other territories connected with Europe by trade, colonialism, missionary evangelism in this period. The range of languages of interest is correspondingly wide. I have spoken in the last couple of years about this project at CUNY New York, Berkeley, Padua, Mainz, UEA Norwich, Eötvös Loránd Budapest, York-Southern Denmark (videoseminar), ENS Paris.\n\nThe project emerged from the two-volume study I published in 2017 with Oxford University Press on The School of Montaigne in Early Modern Europe, which analysed and followed the objects, actors, forms and skills comprising Montaigne’s literary heritage as they moved across Europe.\n\nPatrick J. Murray in the Times Literary Supplement of September 29, 2017: ‘[Warren Boutcher] gives us an in-depth account of Montaigne’s literary influence across the Western world from the sixteenth century to the present day. … [T]he two volumes … represent a remarkable achievement, and one that is all the more impressive in light of its single authorship. Boutcher turns his adroit hand to subjects as various as paratextual literature, German idealism, Roman statuary and papal censorship’.\n\nPeter Platt in Renaissance Quarterly (vol. 71, 2018, 397-400): ‘Warren Boutcher's prodigious - and prodigiously important - book is in some ways a remarkably understated project. ... For the school of Montaigne has had - and continues to have - textbooks in many editions, countless students, myriad teachers. Warren Boutcher is, quite simply, one of its finest instructors.’\n\nGeorge Hoffmann in Renaissance and Reformation (vol. 41, 2018, 152-154): ‘Resembling nothing so much as an Anthony Grafton of vernacular scholarship, Boutcher leaps from France to the Netherlands, from England to Italy, and from Spain to Germany in order to track thousands of interlinked references to the Essays. … . The book’s impressive span aims at two distinct ends: as a summation of Montaigne’s reception and influence, Boutcher’s School of Montaigne stands as a reference work for all scholars and the starting point for those likely to want to explore these questions further; at the same time, it mounts a novel and provocative challenge to current literary studies in how it shows that contextualization can not only determine historical actors, it can liberate them.’\n\nPublications\n\nPublications (since 2011)\n\nBooks\n\n(2017).
