        "text": "Spatiotemporal development of Dances of Death (1400–1800)\n\nWe traced more than 500 Dances of Death created between 1400 and 1800, of which about one-third were monumental, and two-thirds were graphical works. Almost half of these Dances of Death were produced in the German-speaking lands of middle Europe (Fig. ). There are very few Dances of Death east of the imaginary line running from Stockholm to Zagreb, which indicates that this art motive belongs to the Roman-Christian cultural space, as opposed to the Orthodox cultural space. Yet while France hosts a substantive number of Danses Macabres, important parts of the Roman-Christian cultural space, like the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, have only a small number, and there are also a few regions that are even absolutely Dance of Death-free, such as Ireland. Because Italy, Spain, and Ireland were hit very hard and repeatedly by bubonic plague throughout the centuries, the near-absence of Dances of Death in these countries shows that the geographical diffusion of this art form fails to match the geographical pathology of the epidemic. This indicates that the popular hypothesis that Dances of Death were a companion of the plague is incorrect.\n\nWhen we relate the development and diffusion of this art motive to the four periods mentioned above, the following can be observed (Fig. ). In the first or Pre-Reformation period (ca. 1425—ca. 1525) the Dance of Death spread rapidly—also thanks to the invention of print—from its breeding grounds in the north of France and the south of Germany, to reach its largest geographical distribution ever, including areas as far away as Scotland, Finland, Istria, and Andalusia. Although most Dances of Death were still made in France, where the first monumental Dance of Death had been painted in 1424, German-speaking areas also had a large share. Monumental and graphical Dances of Death had roughly equal shares in the total production. In this period, many Dances of Death were commissioned by preaching friars, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans, for whom these macabre pictures were illustrated sermons in which believers were urged to contemplate their sins and better their lives before it was too late. As a matter of fact, many of these Dances of Death included a preacher at the start and/or end of the “dance”. Dominicans and Franciscans strived for a reform of Catholic faith, in which greater emphasis was placed on the strict observance of biblical precepts, such as the rejection of material possessions. They advocated a new spirituality founded on the apostolic ideal of poverty, and they were critical of both religious and worldly leaders (Angenendt 1997). This ‘Pre-Reformation type’ of Dance of Death culminated in Holbein’s Bilder des Todes (created in 1524/25, published in 1538), an immensely popular book illustrated with wood-cuts providing the muster for many Dances of Death in the following period (Holbein 1971).\n\nIn the second period (ca. 1525–ca. 1600) the center of production gradually started to shift to German-speaking areas (present-day Germany, Switzerland, North of Italy). This phase coincided with a very divisive period of church history, ending in a definitive split between the Roman-Catholic church and various Protestant denominations. The Reformation also had a profound influence on the character of Dances of Death and gave rise to a ‘Reformation type’: Dances of Death now became vehicles of theological dispute between Roman Catholicism and reformed Lutheranism or Calvinism. A large majority of Dances of Death produced in this period were commissioned by Protestants and therefore contained sharp criticisms of the Catholic clergy and doctrine. This largely replaced the broader, egalitarian critique of the previous phase. There was a rapid increase in the share of graphical Dances of Death: prints and books provided a convenient means of transportation of the potentially subversive message. Holbein’s prints were re-used many times, sometimes with small variations, but the texts accompanying the pictures were rewritten to make them more explicitly polemical towards Catholicism.\n\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, Roman-Catholics rediscovered the Dance-of-Death motif and adapted it ingeniously to their own needs. In this third period (ca. 1600–ca. 1650), the rate with which new Dances of Death were produced was a little lower as compared with the previous phase, probably due to the Wars of Religion, such as the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) which was fought in Germany at this time. The focus of production now clearly lay in German-speaking areas, particularly in the southern half of present-day Germany and neighboring areas in Switzerland and Austria. Most of the Dances of Death produced in this third phase were commissioned by Roman-Catholics, and focused on the traditional Memento Mori. Critique of churchly or world leaders was largely absent in these Dances of Death. Although the Jesuits did not directly commission them, the similarity between the content of these Catholic Dances of Death and Jesuit theology and didactic (Schwaiger 1998) suggests their involvement in the development and diffusion of this ‘Counter-Reformation type’ of Dances of Death.\n\nIn the fourth period (ca. 1650–ca. 1800) many new Dances of Death were created, exceeding the rate with which they were produced in the two previous phases. The focus of production stayed in German-speaking areas, with some further expansion towards the East, probably following German colonization of present-day Poland and Byelorussia. The Catholic Dance of Death slowly evolved further on the basis developed in the previous phase, without important thematic developments. Many Dances of Death repeated the well-known examples for rural and often remote parishes. Protestant Dances of Death almost disappeared altogether. It is likely that the diminishing popularity of the Dance-of-Death motive among Protestants was due to its confrontational style which became increasingly outdated towards the end of the Thirty Years’ War. This was a historical period characterized by a cautious appeasement between the Christian confessions (Schulze 1998).\n\nThe rise and fall of social critique in Dances of Death\n\nOur in-depth analysis of the thematic development of Dances of Death shows that social critique, in the form of social satire with egalitarian undertones, was largely limited to the first phase (1425–1525). In this Pre-Reformation phase, four elements of the text and/or images of the Dances of Death contributed to the overall message of social critique: explicit references to social (in)equality, representations of the failures of the authorities, representations of emancipated farmers, and a general social realism in all representations.\n\nWhile the earliest Dances of Death only argued that all men are equal in death, i.e. face the same fate in the afterlife, most Pre-Reformation Dances of Death carried the notion that all men are equal before death, in a very concrete sense. One Dance of Death states: “Therefore understand this all/we must all go into the earth/and let nobody raise himself because of his nobility or power/his riches or his fine appearance” [Knoblochtzer H. Der doten dantz mit figuren, clage und antwort schon von allen staten der werlt. UB Heidelberg, GW M 47 257, 22 recto (ca. 1488)]. And another one: “Oh you child of man, come here/and look to see who is the lord and who the servant/because God does justice according to the law/here lies the lord and the servant too” [Monumentaltotentanz von Kientzheim. Reproduction in Stehle B. Der Totentanz von Kienztheim im Ober-Elsass. Strassburg: 1899, 24]. The idea that the principle of biblical equality of all men is also valid for the visible world is apparent in frequent representations of courts of justice, which show biased kings and judges not to treat everyone equally according to his right. Holbein’s image of the judge shows him to be corrupt and evil, but Death stops him from making a verdict favoring the rich (Fig. ).\n\nPre-Reformation Dances of Death also are full of the visible failures of authorities, both religious and secular. A desire of the authors for church and political reform can often easily be discerned. In Knoblochtzer’s Dance of Death, for example, the bishop accuses himself with the following words: “I have received a lot of money/and repressed the poor with violence” [Knoblochtzer H. Der doten dantz mit figuren, clage und antwort schon von allen staten der werlt. UB Heidelberg, GW M 47 257, 3 verso]. Holbein shows the cardinal receiving money from a rich nobleman, in return for a document with seals, but Death lifts his hat to show that he will lose his authority (Fig. ). Princes, noblemen and urban authorities were also often attacked vehemently for neglecting their duties and for their lack of righteousness. In the earliest Dances of Death these worldly authorities were only represented as abstract representatives of the higher order, but towards the end of the fifteenth century Dances of Death criticize their way of life and rule in very concrete ways. In the Kientzheim Dance of Death, Death says of the emperor: “Widows, orphans and land and people/I have not kept in peace./I laid siege, waged a lot of war/and rarely considered public welfare” [Monumentaltotentanz von Kientzheim. Reproduction in Stehle B. Der Totentanz von Kienztheim im Ober-Elsass. Strassburg: 1899, 28–29].\n\nIn the earliest Dances of Death, farmers represented the rather abstract ideal of the biblical Adam: diligence, austerity, and humble acceptance of poverty. But gradually the representation of farmers changed: they became defensible and self-confident. Farmers now could say: “Large works, chopping, plowing/I did at all times/to nourish wife and child/I never wasted money/I already paid my tithes/Serving God and going to church/I never failed out of misery/Therefore death falls me lighter” [Monumentaltotentanz von Kientzheim. Reproduction in Stehle B. Der Totentanz von Kienztheim im Ober-Elsass. Strassburg: 1899, 51]. Holbein has two farmer’s scenes: one according to the traditional scheme, in which Death relieves the hard working plowman, and one in which Death is disguised as a fighting farmer attacking a nobleman (Fig. ). The flail on the ground provides a direct reference to the Bauernkrieg, the German peasant’s revolt of 1524/25, and Death’s taking side with the farmers in that conflict is undisputable.\n\nMore generally, Pre-Reformation Dances of Death slowly but increasingly took the form of a concrete social portrait. The typical sins of each social position were no longer represented in an abstract way, but more specifically, often referring to local circumstances. In one Dance of Death from a famous wine-growing region the usurer says: “I purchase wine and grain/I am delighted when it becomes expensive” [Monumentaltotentanz von Kientzheim. Reproduction in Stehle B. Der Totentanz von Kienztheim im Ober-Elsass. Strassburg: 1899, 48]. Unequal chances of social mobility are referred to when another Dance of Death lets the merchant say: “All nights and days I must wake/in order to make my children into lords/my heart was possessed by earthly goods/when I have to leave I will have a lot of pain” [Monumental Dance of Death of Bern. Reproduction in Tripps J. Den Würmern wirst du Wildbret sein. Der Berner Totentanz des Niklaus Manuel Deutsch in den Aquarellkopien von Albrecht Kauw. Bern: 2005, 75].\n\nIn Pre-Reformation Dances of Death critique of the servants of the faith and critique of inequality went hand in hand, because both served the intimately linked religious and political agendas of the Dominicans and Franciscans and other religious reform movements. But when the Reformation took off, in the early decades of the sixteenth century, Dances of Death mainly became vehicles for confessional strife. Egalitarian critique did not immediately disappear, as is clear from some of Gilles Corrozet’s text variations accompanying Holbein’s pictures: “The lower classes will revolt/against inhumanity/and will take the violent/with them without effort” [Holbein H. The Dance of Death. Facsimile edition. New York, NY: Dover, 1971, 24]. But gradually these Protestant Dances of Death became dominated by church polemics: “You Pope, a real antichrist/wants to be the earthly God/you are only a mendacious man/must now be mocked/in order for the world to see/whom it has honored/you do not love God, only splendor and money/it has lasted long enough” [Denecker J. Todtentantz. Augsburg: 1544, n.p].\n\nReferences to social equality and inequality became rare, and references to injustice were rephrased to remove the sharper, socio-politically subversive edges. During the sixteenth century, Dances of Death seemed to have lost their appetite for a broader social reform, just like Luther condemned the social unrest of the German Peasant’s revolt in favor of social order (Briggs and Burke 2005). Echoing Luther’s respect for secular authority, a Protestant Dance of Death lets the emperor say: “The upper leader, the only lord/of the whole world I am/for whom stretches nobility and honor/and a lot of grace./Here on earth the highest position/I have in my power/the empire, and also much land of my own/which I keep in peace” [Denecker J. Todtentantz. Augsburg: 1544, n.p]. The contrast with earlier representations of the emperor could not have been more striking."
