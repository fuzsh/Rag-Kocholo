        "text": "“ It's not what I believe... it's what I know „ ~ Garnier de Naplouse's final words.\n\nGarnier de Naplouse is a supporting antagonist from the 2007 video game Assassin's Creed.\n\nTo most people, Garnier is a crusader, serving under King Richard I of England. The Grand Master of the Knights Hospitalier, he resides in the poor district of Acre, where he spends most of his time treating the sick and injured.\n\nIn reality, Garnier is secretly a member of the Knights Templar serving Robert de Sable's hidden agenda. These secret scheme's soon brought Garnier and his Templar brothers to the attention of the Order of Assassins. Ultimately, Garnier was the the second of the nine to die at the hands of Altaïr Ibn La'Ahad.\n\nFor his game portrayal, Garnier is voiced by Hubert Fielden.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nGarnier is a middle aged man of average height and build. He is clean shaving, with a receding hairline. For clothing, he wore a dark robe, which bore the emblem of the Hospitalier's on both sleeves. Over this, he wore an apron, which like his robe was dirty and blood-stained, a testament to both his duty and service. A crucifix hung around his neck.\n\nGarnier also wore a leather pouch around his waist, which presumably held supplies for him to treat his patients. As an active Crusader, Garnier, despite the presence of his bodyguards, also carried a sword, which like his herbs, could be whipped out at a moments notice.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nGarnier was a rather strict authoritarian, who always liked to be in control of a situation. He rarely raised his voice and for the most part, spoke in a calm measured voice. Beneath these honeyed words however, his sadistic nature manifested in other ways. He was not afraid to strike his \"patients\", conduct sadistic experiments upon them or resort to extreme measures to keep them at the hospital.\n\nGarnier had a vast knowledge of medicine, including plants and alchemy, which he used to treat those in his hospital. Like the rest of the Levantine Brotherhood, Gainier did not believe in God or an afterlife and exemplified the Templar philosophy of the suffering of the few to benefit mankind.\n\nDespite his lack of conscience though, Garnier did genuinely believe that he was helping the people under his care, whom he referred to as his \"children\". Most of these people came from the very bottom of society and Garnier believed that his actions gave them a second chance at life. It should also be noted that whilst cruel and unethical, his experiments did achieve results, which he used to further the Templar cause. Unlike most of his brother Templar's however, when Altaïr put an end to his twisted scheme's, Garnier accepted his death without complaint.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nMaster Physician: He was a master physician who used his medical prowess to cure many degenerate and ill people of the Holy Land.\n\nToxicologist: His used his knowledge of herbalism and toxicology to cure almost all of the ill and poor people captured by the Knights Hospitalier of their various diseases and health conditions.\n\nSwordsmanship: He was able to combat Altair, a highly trained assassin, with a sword despite Garnier's own advanced age.\n\nLeadership: He was the Grandmaster of the Knight's Hospitalier and led them well with many member commenting positively on Garnier's leadership.\n\nVast Resources: He was not only a High Ranking member of the Templar Order but was also the Grandmaster of the Knight's Hospilatier, a Catholic Order of Knights that provide medical services to Christian Pilgrims int he Holy Land, but became more militarized during the Crusades.\n\nRole in Assassin's Creed[]\n\nEarly Life\n\nGarnier de Naplouse was born in France in 1147. He proved to be a very intelligent young man, who used his knowledge and passion for medicine to treat those in need. At the same time though, Garnier had no conscience or scruples. He viewed his patients as test-subjects, and not as actual humans. Eventually, word of his malpractice reached the higher ups and Garnier left France an exile.\n\nHe later did the same thing in Acre, but remained undiscovered. He took his patients from the surrounding cities Damascus and Jerusalem, and he would never let them leave. He claims he is a man of knowledge, but he lacks ethics.\n\nGarnier de Naplouse was assassinated by Altaïr within his Knights Hospitaller Fortress. He was attending to his victims. He had just broken the legs of a man that was trying to escape. He kept claiming he was actually helping his patients, as they were all poor and ill, and he gave them a new purpose in life, fighting the war for the Templar order. Later, King Richard accused Altair of killing three of his best men (Garnier, William and Sibrand) and Altair justified his deeds by telling Richard that Garnier sought to indoctrinate innocents to his will and use them as mere test subjects in his terrifying experiments.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAlongside all of the other Crusader targets, Garnier de Naplouse was based off of a real life historical character of the same name. However, the real life Garnier de Nablus, who was born in Palestine, was nothing like his Assassin's Creed counterpart.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed version of Garnier is very similar to Qyburn from the Song of Ice And Fire franchise. Both are amoral doctors who conducted inhumane experiments upon innocent people to further their own goals and knowledge."
