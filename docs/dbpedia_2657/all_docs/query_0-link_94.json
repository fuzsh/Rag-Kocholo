        "text": "Holocaust Education in London Primary Schools\n\nThe student's research project centered on the memory of the Holocaust in Europe, particularly in England. The project engaged with the concepts of Memory and Remembering by exploring how the Holocaust is represented in contemporary English education. This research contributed to the debate on how young children should learn about the Holocaust and whether such education can be meaningful (Karayianni, 2020). The student gathered information directly from stakeholders in the English education system to understand how wider cultural conceptions of the Holocaust are created.\n\nThis knowledge was especially important in light of documented misconceptions held by secondary school students in England about their country’s responses to the Holocaust, such as the beliefs that England entered the war to stop the Holocaust, provided safe haven to numerous refugees, or did not know about the Holocaust until after the war (Haward, 2020). The fact that government sources often promoted these misconceptions only exacerbated these pervasive myths. By examining how students are exposed to the Holocaust at early stages of their education, the research aimed to dismantle these falsely-held beliefs and inform decisions about Holocaust education throughout the educational timeline in England, fostering a more accurate collective memory of the Holocaust.\n\nThe student’s previous coursework, which engaged with cultural depictions and perceptions of Jewish identity in contemporary Russian film, provided a foundation for this project. This research added to the understanding of Holocaust representation in the English-speaking world.\n\nContact\n\nPost-War Recovery in Montenegro\n\nMontenegro\n\nThe student's work encompassed both peripheries and memory and remembering, with a specific focus on Montenegro. Montenegro's ambiguity as a country rarely discussed in conversations about the war intrigued the student. They noted the scarcity of sources written since Montenegro's independence in 2006, both in English and Montenegrin.\n\nTheir research delved into the politics of memory, exploring how Serbian/Russian and American/EU influences exerted different pulls on Montenegro. This exploration aimed to shed light on Montenegro's viewpoints, often unknown to the outside world, and to examine how these influences shape the country's narrative and memory of historical events.\n\nContact\n\nReviving Tradition: The Cultural Arts Center in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nThe student's thesis project for a Cultural Arts Center in Zagreb, Croatia, strongly connected to the research priority of \"Memory and Remembering.\" The project aimed to understand how cultural heritage, history, and identity are remembered, preserved, and passed on to future generations. The ethnographic museum within the center served as a repository of cultural memory, displaying traditional costumes and artifacts significant to the lifestyles of various Croatian regions, thereby preserving these elements for future generations.\n\nSimilarly, the performance theater, curated for traditional Croatian folk dance, functioned as a living memory of the nation's cultural legacy. Another goal of the project was to reinstate the style and tradition of the historic Trg Bana Jelačića, preserving the memory and historical significance of the square as a place of cultural and societal importance.\n\nAdditionally, the project addressed the impact of globalization on Croatian culture, which risks overshadowing or marginalizing traditional cultures. By showcasing Croatia's cultural heritage through the Cultural Arts Center, the project aimed to counteract this cultural loss. In all these ways, the entire project embodied the concept of memory and remembering by actively conserving and presenting Croatia's rich cultural heritage and historical legacy.\n\nContact\n\nRule of Law in the European Union: The Role of Domestic Legal Systems on Conflict with the EU\n\nThis student completed research on the history of the EU and the lessons these insights might have for various EU countries today facing rule of law crises.\n\nThe student's project engaged extensively with the Nanovic research priority of “Big Questions about Europe and Humanity.” The subject of the research— the European Union and the rule of law— involved discussion about Europe on a broad scale. By examining the legalistic evolution of the European Union, a supranational organization composed of countries across the European continent, the student aimed to bolster their understanding of how European integration has shaped the rule of law as it is known today.\n\nIn addition, the evaluation of domestic legal systems from member states exposed the student to academic scholarship from across the geographical spectrum of Europe. Looking to the future, the research questions posed by the student laid the groundwork for debate on the values that Europeans hold dear. The project sought to explore what rule of law conflicts reveal about the strength of both domestic and multinational legal structures, and how the European Union can adapt to handle rising threats to judicial independence and corruption.\n\nThe student's findings aimed to reveal not only much about the past and present but also the future of European law and politics.\n\nContact\n\nImpact of L'Arche Community Life in London on Local Community Members\n\nThis research addressed the perceptions of individuals with intellectual disabilities and explored methods for improvement, benefiting both groups. While substantial literature existed on the positive impacts for house members and their assistants, there was a need for scholarly research to demonstrate how the L'Arche model of accompaniment affected the wider community. This highlighted positive interactions, areas for improvement, and strategies to engage general community members more in L'Arche activities.\n\nLondon, a dynamic city that serves as a model for many cities worldwide, housed L'Arche since the 1970s and continued to expand throughout the UK. Studying their successes and failures helped identify best practices for global L'Arche communities and inclusive housing. This research complemented Nanovic’s ongoing Peripheries research on L'Arche in Italy, as the fundamental values of L'Arche were applicable globally.\n\nContact\n\nThe Politics of Housing of Policy: A Comparative Analysis of London and Lisbon\n\nHousing is fundamental to well-being through various channels, including access to decent shelter, healthcare, environmental quality, efficient use of scarce resources, and the type and extent of commuting. However, the housing crisis, which manifests differently across the globe, threatens many livelihoods. Afro-descendent and immigrant communities on the peripheries of London and Lisbon are disproportionately impacted. This capstone project investigated the political constraints to housing policies addressing the fundamental problem of supply. The trend of commodifying housing as an asset rather than recognizing it as a right creates a system of winners and losers.\n\nThis research engaged with the deeply structured political realities that perpetuate disadvantaged economic and social institutions, as well as policies that adversely affect the economic and physical well-being of racially and economically marginalized groups. From a historic and comparative perspective, the project identified opportunities to rectify path dependencies and reform housing policies.\n\nContact\n\nThe Religious Life of Ski Pioneer Sir Arnold Lunn\n\nThe student traveled to archives in London to uncover new insights into the life of ski pioneer Sir Arnold Lunn. In the early 20th century, middle and upper-class Anglo-Americans increasingly turned to mountains at home and abroad in response to the religious, political, and economic shifts of modernity, thereby claiming new frontier space for their discovery. Scholars of Western Europe have overlooked this dynamic, paying little attention to the significance of mountain climbing in their studies of the modern religious situation. Similarly, historians of mountaineering have disregarded the religious dimensions of climbers’ identities and experiences. We cannot make historical sense of one without the other. This project seeks to argue that religion and mountaineering were intrinsically connected and that one cannot understand one without the other.\n\nContact\n\nThe Relationship Between Art and Architecture in European Art Museums\n\nLondon, England; Rome, Italy\n\nThis undergraduate winter break project explored the relationship between art and architecture within pivotal European art museums, and, more specifically, how the European art museum model has impacted the development of the American art museum. The project analyzed the architectural characteristics of a select few of the most important art museums in London and Rome and the ways in which visitors interact with the art in the way it has been exhibited. Since European museums are historically based on the model of retrofitting palaces, factories, or other civic buildings rather than the US model of designing a museum independently, a primary question the project sought to answer is what the relative effectiveness of the European model is compared to the US model.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Krupali Krusche\n\nMary Did You Know: An Exploration of the Gaps That Exist between the Hermeneutical and Theological Reverence of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church and the Simultaneous Silencing of Female Voices within Church Leadership\n\nVatican City; Rome, Italy; Dublin, Ireland\n\nThis undergraduate fall break project compared the deep veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church with the silencing of female Catholic religious, specifically the nuns in Northern Ireland and the sisters in Rome who write for Women Church World, and survivors of sexual violence on Catholic campuses in the United States. The project sought to answer how religious institutions either inadvertently or explicitly silence the voices of survivors through forced forgiveness, exclusive policies, and victim-blaming rhetoric and practices. The project also considered how female religious leaders are reshaping the narrative and interpretation of religious text and how this feminist hermeneutical work may set the Catholic Church up to be more inclusive of female voices in the future.\n\nFaculty Advisor: George Lopez\n\nImagining an Age of Revolution? Interpretations of the American Revolution in the Italian States (1765-1799)\n\nNaples, Italy; Monticello, Virginia\n\nThis graduate student project investigated the creation of the “Age of Revolution”—how and when people started thinking they were living in such an age and how the idea of an “age” was constructed in the first place. Taking case studies of the American revolution and the Jacobin Triennium in the Italian States, the project observed how interpretations of revolutionary events changed over the course of the eighteenth century. The project argued that the French Revolution introduced this radically new notion of “revolution”—revolution as a radical break from the past and an occasion to establish a new, truly egalitarian and democratic society—and thereby reframed the narratives of revolution in Europe and the Americas.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Patrick Griffin\n\nPower and Patronage: An Examination of Female Lay Religious Houses in Late Medieval Bavaria\n\nMunich, Freising, and Landshut, Germany\n\nThis graduate student project investigated the formation and dissolution of patronage relationships between various members of the Wittelsbach family, the dynastic rulers of Bavaria, and communities of laywomen living a religious life in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Informing a later dissertation proposal, the project sought to illuminate the ways that patronage relationships both affected and were affected by changing views of acceptable religious practice as German territories entered into the crisis of the Reformation. The project hoped to answer questions about the role of secular leaders in shaping these religious trends, underscoring the complex and often contradictory nature of the relationship between secular and religious authority in the later medieval period, and compare these issues to modern religious questions.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Daniel Hobbins\n\nPortugal and Immigration\n\nLisbon and Coimbra, Portugal\n\nWhen discussing the refugee crisis, Portugal is often overlooked; while many immigrants do not even consider the country as a destination, it has agreed to take double the number of immigrants allocated to them by the EU. This undergraduate spring break project investigated what the attitudes toward immigrants, particularly Syrian/Middle Eastern refugees, are like in Portugal and what the country has done proactively to either attract or deter immigration. The project interviewed government officials, NGOs, migrants, and Portuguese citizens.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Marcio Bahia\n\nAnglican Influence on the East Syriac Rites of Preparing the Eucharistic Gifts\n\nLondon, England\n\nThis graduate student project explores a liturgical rite in the Church of the East—the preparation of the Eucharistic bread and wine in the East Syriac tradition. The project investigated the unique intercultural and interdenominational interactions between the Church of England and the Church of the East, as the first printed edition of this liturgical service was produced by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission in 1890. The project sought to better understand how English missionaries used these manuscripts to produce their printed text of the preparatory Eucharistic rites for the benefit of Assyrian Christians and what effect these European missionaries had on Middle Eastern Christians, and vice versa.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Maxwell Johnson\n\n“My Flesh Trembleth”: The Chaos of Scottish Piety within the Early British Empire\n\nGlasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nThis graduate student project explored the intellectual creativity of Scottish faithful in forming their own strategies for identity and placement during the age of empire and the Enlightenment. Emphasizing the role of religious philosophy within this process of understanding, this project argued that the ways in which men and women interacted with the empire registered the intellectual, religious, and social tumult incurred from the 1707 Act of Union and Enlightenment ideas. The project evaluated how the existence of cross-national networks affected local and personal interpretations at a time when intellectual and religious instability prevailed as a result of peoples, ideas, and nations clashing because of this new British entity.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Mark Noll\n\nNorms, Balancing, and U.S.—Soviet Litigation During the Cold War\n\nWashington, District of Columbia\n\nThis graduate student project investigated high profile instances of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, questioning why the US chose to litigate some of these incidents while leaving others to be resolved politically. The project generated a journal article on the causal logic behind the litigation attempts, and afterward the research served as the basis for a book project on the diplomatic history of these events. The project sought to advance scholarship on the politics of the early Cold War in Eastern Europe, demonstrating how the string of attempts at international litigation initiated by the US in the 1950s reveals a presidential administration attempting to use law as a bargaining tactic in the European theater.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Emilia Justyna Powell\n\nPeculiar Positions of Power: Lay Women as “Good Americans and Good Catholics,” 1867-1907\n\nVatican City\n\nThis graduate student project examined the life and career of Ella B. Edes (1832-1916), an American lay woman who worked in Rome as a journalist for many Catholic publications and acted as a translator, money manager, and reporter for the Propaganda Fide, the Holy See’s congregation for overseas “mission territories.” In contrast to earlier historians who viewed Edes primarily as an “agent” of bishops trying to advance their causes at the Vatican, this project investigated the broad scope of Edes’s life and work in Rome and the meaning of her “peculiar position” as a person of influence whose official recognition and advancement at the Vatican was severely limited by her gender.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Kathleen Cummings\n\nThe Sources of Dante Alighieri’s Intellectual Formation (1290-1301): From the Bolognese Notarial Tracce to Florentine Quaestiones Quodlibetales\n\nBologna and Florence, Italy\n\nThis graduate student project investigated the intellectual formation of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) in 1290s Florence, focusing on how Dante had access to such an expanse of literary culture. The project explored the avenues through which a lay person like Dante could have access to the materials he commanded, at a time when the circulation of theological, philosophical, and literary works was primarily controlled by clerics. The project sought to compile a complete and paleographically accurate transcription of the main material that would be edited, analyzed, and discussed in a future dissertation on the subject.\n\nFaculty Advisor: Zygmunt G.
