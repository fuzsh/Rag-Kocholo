        "text": "Curd Jürgens (commonly billed as \"Curt Jurgens\" in anglophone countries) was one of the most successful European film actors of the 20th Century. He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, Jürgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: Jürgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France.\n\nJürgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. Jürgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war.\n\nHis appearance in Des Teufels General (1955) (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as Brigitte Bardot's older lover in Roger Vadim's ...und immer lockt das Weib (1956) (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" Jürgens, casting him in Duell im Atlantik (1957) as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander Robert Mitchum. He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., Der längste Tag (1962), the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries Agent in eigener Sache (1982) -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in Lord Jim (1965)) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in Der Spion, der mich liebte (1977); it was Moore's favorite Bond film.\n\nJürgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany.\n\nKarl Valentin, whose real name is Valentin Ludwig Fey, began an apprenticeship as a carpenter in 1897 after attending a private school. Two years later he met Gisela Royes, his future wife. Two daughters were born from this union. Between 1899 and 1901, Valentin worked as a journeyman carpenter. The following year he attended the Strebel comedy school in Munich. He made his first appearance on October 1, 1901 under his stage name Karl Valentin. His father died during this performance. Valentin then ran the Falk und Fey shipping business together with his mother, which was sold as a bankrupt company in 1906.\n\nIn the same year, Valentin moved with his family to Zittau in Saxony, his mother's hometown. In 1907 he started a tour. But success with the self-built musical device \"Living Orchestrion\" failed to materialize and Valentin returned to Munich. There he initially worked in an inn. From 1908 onward he had success with his monologues \"The Aquarium\" and was hired by the Volkssängerbühne in the \"Frankfurter Hof\". Valentin's comedy was based on the grotesque language of his long body, on funny puns and slapstick. His jokes often hit the audience or himself. The pessimism and tragic character of his comedy had a real background.\n\nValentin often chafed against reality, against official or social circumstances or against his fellow human beings. In 1911 he met Elisabeth Wellano, his later stage partner as Lisl Karlstadt. During this time he married Gisela Royes. In 1912/13, the first silent film that has survived to this day was released with the title \"Karl Valentin's Wedding\", in which he exposed the marriage institution to satire. In his enthusiasm for the medium of film, Karl Valentin made around 40 films, which were often based on his stage jokes. In 1914 the first works on the program \"Tingeltangel\" were created, which also contains the well-known sketch \"The Orchestra Rehearsal\". Exempt from military service for health reasons, Karl Valentin gave almost 120 performances in hospitals during the First World War.\n\nFrom 1915 he directed the Munich cabaret \"Wien-München\". Together with Berthold Brecht, Valentin parodied his play \"Drumming in the Night\" at the Munich Kammerspiele. In 1922/23 the comedian appeared alongside Brecht, Erich Engel, Lisl Karlstadt and Blandine Ebinger in the surrealist film \"Mysteries of a Hairdressing Salon\". During this time Valentin performed abroad for the first time. His first guest appearance in Berlin in 1923 was enthusiastically received by Alfred Kerr and Kurt Tucholsky. He was called a \"word picker\" because of his linguistic acrobatics. Valentin's last known silent film, \"Der Sonderling\", was made in 1929. Two years later he opened his own theater in the Goethe Hall on Leopoldstrasse in Munich.\n\nClashes with the police arose because of fire safety requirements. In 1932 he took part in his first sound film \"The Bartered Bride\". He adopted a skeptical attitude towards the Nazi regime, but made no political statements. In 1934, Karl Valentin opened his \"Panoptikum\" as an exhibition of horror and nonsense items such as a glass of Berlin air. But the project initially failed until it was reopened the following year - but with the same failure. After the Nazi henchmen banned the film \"The Inheritance\", in which Valentin took part, because of \"miserable tendencies\", he rarely received film offers. From 1939 onward, the comedian and his new partner and lover Annemarie Fischer had success with the \"Ritterspelunke\" project, a mixture of panopticon, pub and theater.\n\nDisputes with Nazi authorities were one reason for the closure of the economically successful \"Ritterspelunke\". The room was supposed to become an air raid shelter. From 1940 to 1947 he did not appear in public, but wrote many dialogue pieces and poems. His last play, \"Family Sorrows,\" was written in 1943. Due to economic hardship, he became a journalist for the Munich Feldpost. After the war, Valentin tried to stay afloat by selling home-made household items. The radio series on Bavarian Radio \"It's about Karl Valentin\" was discontinued because listeners complained about the excessive pessimism.\n\nRadio and record recordings followed in 1946 and a joint appearance with Lisl Karlstadt the following year.\n\nKarl Valentin died on February 9, 1948 in Planegg near Munich of a cold caused by malnutrition.\n\nBorn in Munich in 1969, Gedeon was raised bilingual (English & German). He was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version.\n\nGedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for 2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side.\n\nIn 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup. Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman, Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action series, sold to over 120 territories).\n\nin 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky) in Quentin Tarantino's new movie Inglorious Basterds."
