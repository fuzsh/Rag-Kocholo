        "text": "Early Life\n\nWangari Muta Maathai was born on April 1, 1940, in Nyeri, Kenya. She attended college in the United States, receiving a bachelor’s degree in biology from Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College) in Kansas in 1964 and a master’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in 1966. In 1971 she completed her Ph.D. at the University of Nairobi, making her the first woman in either East or Central Africa to earn a doctorate. After graduating, she began teaching in the Department of Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Nairobi. In 1976 she became chair of the department.\n\nEnvironmental Work\n\nMaathai was working with the National Council of Women of Kenya when she began to explore the idea that village women could improve the environment by planting trees. Her goal was twofold: to provide a fuel source for families and to slow the processes of deforestation and desertification. In 1977 she founded the Green Belt Movement to further her purpose, and by the early 21st century the organization had planted some 50 million trees. In 1986 organization members started the Pan African Green Belt Network, which was dedicated to providing information about conservation and environmental improvement to world leaders. As a result of the organization’s activism, similar movements were started in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and other African countries.\n\nOther Work\n\nMaathai’s other interests included human rights, AIDS prevention, and women’s issues. Maathai often addressed these concerns at meetings of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2002 she was elected to Kenya’s National Assembly, and the next year she was appointed assistant minister of environment, natural resources, and wildlife.\n\nMaathai was the author of several books. In The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach and the Experience (1988) she detailed the history of the organization. Maathai released an autobiography, Unbowed, in 2007. In The Challenge for Africa (2009) she criticized Africa’s ineffective leadership and prompted Africans to solve their problems without Western help. She also contributed to such international periodicals as the Los Angeles Times and the Guardian. Maathai died on September 25, 2011, in Nairobi, Kenya."
