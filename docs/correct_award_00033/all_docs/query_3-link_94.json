        "text": "Letter from the WCC general secretary to\n\nH.E. Prof. Wangari Maathai, assistant minister\n\nMinistry of Environment and Natural Resources\n\nGovernment of Kenya\n\n8 October 2004\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nWe greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nOn behalf of the World Council of Churches and as your compatriot, I congratulate you for being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2004. Being the first African woman in history to receive this prestigious Prize, you have brought honour to the African Continent and its people. Today, in Africa, every woman, man and child must feel proud of your achievement.\n\nThe World Council of Churches is fortunate to have had you as an advisor on environmental issues. We fondly recall your participation in the Faith and Science Conference, which the Council organized at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the year 1979, where you were the key-note speaker. This was a landmark conference in our history as it was instrumental in setting up the programme on \"Just, Participatory and Sustainable Societies\". Having gained much from your insights, we have always treasured this association.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is in recognition of the immense service you have rendered to sustaining life through saving the environment from wanton destruction. This you have done through the Green Belt movement, which you founded in 1977 and which has made a valuable contribution to earth ethics. You have done all this through mobilizing the people and through legislative means. Your campaign against deforestation across Africa is a unique contribution not only to save African forests, but also African lives. As the Nobel Committee correctly says, you represent an \"example and a source of inspiration for everyone in Africa fighting for sustainable development, democracy and peace\".\n\nMay our Lord's blessings be with you as you continue to work for His creation and for His people.\n\nYours in Christ,\n\nRev. Dr Samuel Kobia\n\nGeneral Secretary"
