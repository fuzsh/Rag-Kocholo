        "text": "Wangari Maathai was the first African woman and first environmentalist to receive a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn 1977 in Kenya, she started the Green Belt Movement. Wangari’s goals had been to use tree planting to restore the environment while providing income and resources to African women. The group’s objectives broadened to the protection of human and environmental rights, civic education, and the promotion of democratic values while valuing the cultural heritage of Africa. The GBM has now planted tens of millions of trees.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Wangari explains that “the state of any country’s environment is a reflection of the kind of governance in place, and without good governance there can be no peace.” The efforts of the GBM and other organizations led to the peaceful transition to a democratic society in Kenya, and the tree became a symbol of the democratic struggle. Her speech is strikingly illustrated and followed by an analysis written by Laia de Ahumada.\n\nThe Speak Out series publishes the most inspiring speeches of our times, then deconstructs them to give young readers a deeper understanding of global issues and the power of language to influence them.\n\nKey Text Features\n\nbiographical information\n\ndefinitions\n\nexplanation\n\nfacts\n\nheadings\n\nhistorical context\n\nillustrations\n\ninformational note\n\nCorrelates to the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts:\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.4.2\n\nDetermine the main idea of a text and explain how it is supported by key details; summarize the text.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.6.3\n\nAnalyze in detail how a key individual, event, or idea is introduced, illustrated, and elaborated in a text (e.g., through examples or anecdotes).\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.6.6\n\nDetermine an author's point of view or purpose in a text and explain how it is conveyed in the text.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.6.9\n\nCompare and contrast one author's presentation of events with that of another (e.g., a memoir written by and a biography on the same person)."
