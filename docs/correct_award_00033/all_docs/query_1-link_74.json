Delivered before members of the Nobel Foundation on December 10, 2004, Oslo, Norway. Available online at 〈http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/2004/maathai-lecture-text.html〉 (Accessed March 10, 2006).\n\nAbout the Author: Wangari Muta Maathai, chairman of the department of veterinarian anatomy at the University of Nairobi, is a biologist, environmentalist, and human rights activist.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWangari Maathai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, in recognition of her work with the Green Belt Movement, a group that organizes disadvantaged women in Africa to plant trees in order to preserve the environment and improve women' quality of life.\n\nWhile working for the National Council of Women of Kenya in 1976, Maathai came up with the idea to replenish part of the local landscape with trees planted by impoverished women with few opportunities for employment and social advancement. The grass-roots movement quickly blossomed into the organization known as the Green Belt Movement.\n\nIn 2002, Maathai was elected to Kenya's parliament, and was later appointed Kenya's Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nIn awarding the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize to Maathai, the foundation specifically commended Maathai \"for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\" In a press release announcing the prize, the foundation asserted that Maathai had \"taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy, human rights and women's rights in particular. She thinks globally and acts locally.\"\n\nPRIMARY SOURCE\n\nYour Majesties\n\nYour Royal Highnesses\n\nHonourable Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nExcellencies\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\nI stand before you and the world humbled by this recognition and uplifted by the honour of being the 2004 Nobel Peace Laureate.\n\nAs the first African woman to receive this prize, I accept it on behalf of the people of Kenya and Africa, and indeed the world. I am especially mindful of women and the girl child. I hope it will encourage them to raise their voices and take more space for leadership. I know the honor also gives a deep sense of pride to our men, both old and young. As a mother, I appreciate the inspiration this brings to the youth and urge them to use it to pursue their dreams.\n\nAlthough this prize comes to me, it acknowledges the work of countless individuals and groups across the globe…. To all who feel represented by this prize I say use it to advance your mission and meet the high expectations the world will place on us.\n\nThis honour is also for my family, friends, partners and supporters throughout the world…. Because of this support, I am here today to accept this great honour.\n\nI am immensely privileged to join my fellow African Peace laureates, Presidents Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the late Chief Albert Luthuli, the late Anwar el-Sadat and the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.\n\n… I have always believed that solutions to most of our problems must come from us.\n\nIn this year's prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has placed the critical issue of environment and its linkage to democracy and peace before the world. For their visionary action, I am profoundly grateful….\n\n… As I was growing up, I witnessed forests being cleared and replaced by commercial plantations, which destroyed local biodiversity and the capacity of the forests to conserve water.\n\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nIn 1977, when we started the Green Belt Movement, I was partly responding to needs identified by rural women, namely lack of firewood, clean drinking water, balanced diets, shelter and income.\n\nThroughout Africa, women are the primary caretakers, holding significant responsibility for tilling the land and feeding their families. As a result, they are often the first to become aware of environmental damage as resources become scarce and incapable of sustaining their families.\n\nThe women we worked with recounted that unlike in the past, they were unable to meet their basic needs….\n\nTree planting became a natural choice to address some of the initial basic needs identified by women. Also, tree planting is simple, attainable and guarantees quick, successful results within a reasonable amount time….\n\nSo, together, we have planted over 30 million trees that provide fuel, food, shelter, and income to support their children's education and household needs. The activity also creates employment and improves soils and watersheds … This work continues.\n\nInitially, the work was difficult because historically our people have been persuaded to believe that because they are poor, they lack not only capital, but also knowledge and skills to address their challenges. Instead they are conditioned to believe that solutions to their problems must come from \"outside.\"…\n\nIn order to assist communities to understand these linkages, we developed a citizen education program, during which people identify their problems, the causes and possible solutions. They then make connections between their own personal actions and the problems they witness in the environment and in society….\n\nOn the environment front, they are exposed to many human activities that are devastating to the environment and societies. These include widespread destruction of ecosystems, especially through deforestation, climatic instability, and contamination in the soils and waters that all contribute to excruciating poverty.\n\nIn the process, the participants discover that they must be part of the solutions…. They come to recognize that they are the primary custodians and beneficiaries of the environment that sustains them.\n\nEntire communities also come to understand that while it is necessary to hold their governments accountable, it is equally important that in their own relationships with each other, they exemplify the leadership values they wish to see in their own leaders, namely justice, integrity and trust.\n\nAlthough initially the Green Belt Movement's tree planting activities did not address issues of democracy and peace, it soon became clear that responsible governance of the environment was impossible without democratic space. Therefore, the tree became a symbol for the democratic struggle in Kenya….\n\nIn time, the tree also became a symbol for peace and conflict resolution, especially during ethnic conflicts in Kenya when the Green Belt Movement used peace trees to reconcile disputing communities…. Using trees as a symbol of peace is in keeping with a widespread African tradition. For example, the elders of the Kikuyu carried a staff from the thigi tree that, when placed between two disputing sides, caused them to stop fighting and seek reconciliation….\n\nSuch practices are part of an extensive cultural heritage, which contributes both to the conservation of habitats and to cultures of peace. With the destruction of these cultures and the introduction of new values, local biodiversity is no longer valued or protected and as a result, it is quickly degraded and disappears. For this reason, The Green Belt Movement explores the concept of cultural biodiversity, especially with respect to indigenous seeds and medicinal plants….\n\nIt is 30 years since we started this work…. Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and in the process heal our own—indeed, to embrace the whole creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. This will happen if we see the need to revive our sense of belonging to a larger family of life, with which we have shared our evolutionary process.\n\nIn the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground. A time when we have to shed our fear and give hope to each other.\n\nThat time is now.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has challenged the world to broaden the understanding of peace: there can be no peace without equitable development; and there can be no development without sustainable management of the environment in a democratic and peaceful space. This shift is an idea whose time has come.\n\n… Those of us who have been privileged to receive education, skills, and experiences and even power must be role models for the next generation of leadership….\n\nCulture plays a central role in the political, economic and social life of communities. Indeed, culture may be the missing link in the development of Africa….\n\nAfricans, especially, should re-discover positive aspects of their culture. In accepting them, they would give themselves a sense of belonging, identity and self-confidence.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThere is also need to galvanize civil society and grassroots movements to catalyze change. I call upon governments to recognize the role of these social movements in building a critical mass of responsible citizens, who help maintain checks and balances in society. On their part, civil society should embrace not only their rights but also their responsibilities.\n\nFurther, industry and global institutions must appreciate that ensuring economic justice, equity and ecological integrity are of greater value than profits at any cost. The extreme global inequities and prevailing consumption patterns continue at the expense of the environment and peaceful co-existence. The choice is ours.\n\nI would like to call on young people to commit themselves to activities that contribute toward achieving their long-term dreams. They have the energy and creativity to shape a sustainable future. To the young people I say, you are a gift to your communities and indeed the world. You are our hope and our future.\n\nThe holistic approach to development, as exemplified by the Green Belt Movement, could be embraced and replicated in more parts of Africa and beyond. It is for this reason that I have established the Wangari Maathai Foundation to ensure the continuation and expansion of these activities. Although a lot has been achieved, much remains to be done.\n\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nAs I conclude I reflect on my childhood experience when I would visit a stream next to our home to fetch water for my mother. I would drink water straight from the stream. Playing among the arrowroot leaves I tried in vain to pick up the strands of frogs' eggs, believing they were beads. But every time I put my little fingers under them they would break. Later, I saw thousands of tadpoles: black, energetic and wriggling through the clear water against the background of the brown earth. This is the world I inherited from my parents.\n\nToday, over 50 years later, the stream has dried up, women walk long distances for water, which is not always clean, and children will never know what they have lost. The challenge is to restore the home of the tadpoles and give back to our children a world of beauty and wonder.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\nIn recent decades, the Nobel Foundation has broadened its definition of peace when considering the Nobel Peace Prize to include how benefits to the environment and human rights can help the world's chances for attaining a lasting peace.\n\nThe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Maathai also helped to focus international attention on the concept of sustainable development and how a range of actions from local to international can foster such development. Sustainable development practices are also argued to reduce risk of environmental disaster. The ISDR Secretariat of the U.N. International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines sustainable development as, \"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts: the concept of 'needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and the future needs. (Brundtland Commission, 1987).\"\n\nAdvocates of sustainable development practice argue that ecosystem protection is part of an overall concept of sustainable development that integrates political systems, cultures, economic viability, and environmental protection.\n\nFURTHER RESOURCES\n\nBooks\n\nLappé, F.M.
