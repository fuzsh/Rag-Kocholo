        "text": "Wangarĩ Muta Maathai ( 1 April 1940 – 25 September 2011) was a Kenyan social, environmental and a political activist. She was the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAs an academic and the author of several books, Maathai was not only an activist but also an intellectual who has made significant contributions to thinking about ecology, development, gender, and African cultures and religions.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMaathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, Nyeri District, in the central highlands of the colony of Kenya. Her family was Kikuyu and had lived in the area for several generations.\n\nAround 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the Rift Valley, near the town of Nakuru, where her father had found work. There was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked, so she returned to Ihithe with her mother. Her father remained at the farm. At the age of eight, she joined her elder brothers at Ihithe Primary School.\n\nAt the age of 11, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri. Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years.\n\nDuring this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, then a United States senator, agreed to fund a program that was called the Kennedy Airlift. It allowed scholarships for promisimg students from African countries. Maathai received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas, where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry and German.\n\nShe received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1964. Then, she studied at the University of Pittsburgh for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute, and during her time in Pittsburgh. In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences, and was appointed to a position as research assistant to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nWhen she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias. After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the University of Giessen in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the microanatomy section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi.\n\nCareer outline\n\nIn 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she travelled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich.\n\nIn the spring of 1969, she returned to Nairobi to continue studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer.\n\nIn 1971, she became the first Eastern African woman to receive a PhD, her doctorate in veterinary anatomy, from the University College of Nairobi, which became the University of Nairobi the following year.\n\nMaathai became a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1976 and associate professor in 1977. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions.\n\nIn 1977, Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, an environmental non-governmental organization focused on the planting of trees, environmental conservation, and women's rights.\n\nIn 1979, she took a job at the Economic Commission for Africa through the United Nations Development Programme, in Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nIn 1979, Maathai got the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). she continued to be reelected every year until she retired from the position in 1987.\n\nIn January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.\n\nMaathai campaigned for parliament in the 2002 elections and won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.\n\nBetween January 2003 and November 2005 she served as Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources in the government of President Mwai Kibaki.\n\nIn 2003, she founded the Mazingira Green Party of Kenya.\n\nOn 28 March 2005, Maathai was elected the first president of the African Union's Economic, Social and Cultural Council and was appointed a goodwill ambassador for an initiative aimed at protecting the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem.\n\nUntil her death in 2011, Maathai served on the Eminent Advisory Board of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa (AWEPA).\n\nActivism\n\nAt the University of Nairobi Maathai campaigned for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university.\n\nIn addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, she became involved in a number of civic organisations in the early 1970s. She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the Kenya Red Cross Society, becoming its director in 1973. She was also a member of the Kenya Association of University Women.\n\nIn 1974, she became a member of the local board of the Environment Liaison Centre. The Centre encouraged non-governmental organisations to participate in the work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nMaathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). Through her work at these various volunteer associations, she understood that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.\n\nShe started the Green Belt Movement. Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.\n\nIn 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger.\n\n2004 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nWangarĩ Maathai was awarded the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for her \"contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\" Maathai was the first African woman to win the prestigious award.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn April 1966, she met Mwangi Mathai, another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband.\n\nShe and Mwangi Mathai married in May 1969. Later that year, she became pregnant with her first son, Waweru. Her daughter, Wanjira, was born in December 1971. In 1974, Maathai's family expanded to include her third child, son Muta.\n\nMaathai and her husband, Mwangi Mathai, separated in 1977. Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra \"a\" instead of changing her name.\n\nWangari Maathai quotes\n\n“Human rights are not things that are put on the table for people to enjoy. These are things you fight for and then you protect.”\n\n“The generation that destroys the environment is not the generation that pays the price.”\n\n“There are opportunities even in the most difficult moments.”\n\n“A tree has roots in the soil yet reaches to the sky. It tells us that in order to aspire we need to be grounded and that no matter how high we go.”\n\n“When we plant trees, we plant the seeds of peace and hope.”\n\n“What people see as fearlessness is really persistence.”\n\nDeath\n\nMaathai died of complications from ovarian cancer on 25 September 2011.\n\nHer remains were cremated and buried at the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies in Nairobi.\n\nInteresting facts about Wangari Maathai\n\nAs a student, Maathai was involved with the Legion of Mary, whose members attempted \"to serve God by serving fellow human beings.\"\n\nOn her retirn to Kenya from the USA, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring to be known by her birth name, Wangarĩ Muta.\n\nIn 1960s, she rented a small shop in the city, and established a general store, at which her sisters worked.\n\nIn 1969, her husband campaigned for a seat in Parliament, narrowly losing. In 1976, he campaigned again and won.\n\nMaathai became the first woman in East and Central Africa to become a Doctor of Philosophy, receiving her PhD from the University of Nairobi in Kenya.\n\nMaathai was an elected member of the Parliament of Kenya.\n\nIn 1992, she was shortly jailed for her political activism.\n\nIn 2001, she was arrested twice and released without being charged.\n\nIn 2006, Maathai was one of the eight flag-bearers at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.\n\nIn August 2006, she met then United States Senator Barack Obama when he traveled to Kenya. They planted a tree together in Uhuru Park in Nairobi.\n\nMaathai was one of the founders of the Nobel Women's Initiative along with sister Nobel Peace laureates Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan Maguire.\n\nRecognition\n\nIn 1984, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"converting the Kenyan ecological debate into mass action for reforestation\".\n\nShe was an Honorary Councillor of the World Future Council.\n\nIn 1991, she received the Goldman Environmental Prize in San Francisco and the Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership in London.\n\nIn 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Connecticut College.\n\nIn June 2009, Maathai was named as one of PeaceByPeace.com's first peace heroes.\n\nIn 2012, Wangarĩ Gardens opened in Washington, DC.\n\nIn October 2016, Forest Road in Nairobi was renamed to Wangarĩ Maathai Road for her efforts to oppose several attempts to degrade forests and public parks through the Green Belt Movement.\n\nIn 2015, UNESCO published the graphic novel Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement as part of their UNESCO Series on Women in African History. As an artistic and visual interpretation intended for private or public use in classrooms, it tells the story of Maathai and the movement she started.\n\nWangarĩ Maathai Forest Champion Award\n\nIn 2012, the Collaborative Partnership on Forests CPF, an international consortium of 14 organisations, secretariats and institutions working on international forest issues, launched the inaugural Wangarĩ Maathai Forest Champion Award.\n\nWinners have included:\n\n2012 – Narayan Kaji Shrestha, with an honourable mention to Kurshida Begum\n\n2014 – Martha Isabel \"Pati\" Ruiz Corzo, with an honourable mention to Chut Wutty\n\n2015 – Gertrude Kabusimbi Kenyangi\n\n2017 – Maria Margarida Ribeiro da Silva, a Brazilian forestry activist\n\n2019 – Léonidas Nzigiyimpa, a Burundian forestry activist\n\n2022 – Cécile Ndjebet, a Cameroonian activist\n\nSelected publications\n\nThe bottom is heavy too: even with the Green Belt Movement : the Fifth Edinburgh Medal Address (1994)\n\nBottle-necks of development in Africa (1995)\n\nThe Canopy of Hope: My Life Campaigning for Africa, Women, and the Environment (2002)\n\nUnbowed: A Memoir (2006) ISBN: 9780307492333\n\nReclaiming rights and resources women, poverty and environment (2007)\n\nRainwater Harvesting (2008)\n\nState of the world's minorities 2008: events of 2007 (2008)\n\nMoral Ground: Ethical Action for a Planet in Peril.
