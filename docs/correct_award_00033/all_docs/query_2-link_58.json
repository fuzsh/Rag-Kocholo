        "text": "It has been 12 years since Nobel Peace Prize winner and environmental warrior Wangari Maathai passed on but she still remains unforgettable\n\nKnown for speaking to power, Maathai was also a woman of many firsts, including being the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree\n\nMaathai died in 2011 of Ovarian cancer bravely borne and was eulogised by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Al Gore, Barack Obama among many others\n\nTwelve years have passed since one of Kenya's iconic women Wangari Muta Maathai breathed her last but the legacy of the larger-than-life figure remains.\n\nFearless crusader for the environment\n\nTo some, she was a fearless crusader for the environment, tireless social activist, human rights defender, women's rights advocate, woman of trees, role model, MP, Nobel Peace prize winner while others simply knew her as a mother, friend or colleague.\n\nRegardless of the title, she was a woman who cannot be easily forgotten.\n\nWoman of firsts\n\nAs far as breaking ceilings is concerned, the queen from Nyeri county takes the trophy.\n\nBorn in 1940, Maathai would go on to become a woman of many firsts starting with being the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree.\n\nThe obviously intelligent woman pursued doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi. She obtained a PhD in 1971 from the University of Nairobi where she also taught veterinary anatomy.\n\nPreviously, Maathai had earned a degree in Biological Sciences from Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964) and a subsequent Master of Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Prize organisation, Mathaai became the first chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1966 and also took the same position as an associate professor in 1977.\n\nMaathai also shocked the world and made Kenya proud when she became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace prize in 2004.\n\nWhile presenting her with the prize, the Nobel committee said that her \"unique forms of action have contributed to drawing attention to political oppression – nationally and internationally\".\n\nWomen's rights advocate\n\nMaathai was a tireless advocate of the women's rights movement, a passion that saw her join the National Council of Women of Kenya in 1976-87 and chairman in 1981-87.\n\n\"It was while she served in the National Council of Women that she introduced the idea of planting trees with the people in 1976 and continued to develop it into a broad-based, grassroots organization whose main focus is the planting of trees with women groups,\" wrote the Nobel Prize organisation.\n\nThrough the Green Belt Movement, Maathai assisted women in planting more than 20 million trees on their farms, schools and church compounds.\n\nMaathai spoke on behalf of women at special sessions of the General Assembly for the five-year review of the earth summit.\n\nShe also served on the commission for Global Governance and Commission on the Future.\n\nWarrior of the environment\n\nIn 1986, Maathai established a Pan African Green Belt Network and has exposed over 40 individuals from other African countries to their approach of conserving the environment.\n\nSeveral African countries have so far successfully launched similar initiatives in Africa and they include Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, etc.\n\nSocial activist extraordinaire\n\nAmong the attributes that endeared Maathai to the masses was her sensitivity to the plight of the poor and she became a co-chair of the Jubilee 2000 Africa Campaign.\n\nThe latter sought to cancel unpayable backlog debts of the poor countries in Africa by the year 2000.\n\nTruth to power\n\nIt was not lost on Maathai that Kenyans were living under a repressive regime and she joined the struggle against the government of former president Daniel Moi.\n\nHer efforts would see her stop powerful politicians from grabbing land, especially forests, and this caused her to be in their bad books.\n\nShe was beaten severally and arrested for her convictions.\n\nSo much was her love for trees and the environment that she once stood up to power and protected the landmark Uhuru Park from being grabbed to make skyscrapers in the city.\n\nThe demonstrations saw her strip naked and she was severely injured but the park remains to date.\n\nWon numerous awards\n\nThankfully, Maathai's work did not go unnoticed both home and away which earned her numerous awards. Some of the awards include The Sophie Prize (2004), The Petra Kelly Prize for Environment (2004), The Conservation Scientist Award (2004), J. Sterling Morton Award (2004), WANGO Environment Award (2003) and Outstanding Vision and Commitment Award (2002), Excellence Award from the Kenyan Community Abroad (2001) among many others.\n\nMaathai was also listed on UNEP’s Global 500 Hall of Fame and named one of the 100 heroines of the world.\n\nIn June 1997, she was elected by Earth Times as one of 100 persons in the world who have made a difference in the environmental arena.\n\nShe also wore several honorary degrees from prestigious institutions and was featured in various publications as well.\n\nQuite a number of organisations including the UN Secretary General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament were also privileged to have her as a board member.\n\nMaathai the politician\n\nIn the 2002 general election, Maathai was elected to parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.\n\nShe was rightfully appointed by the president, as assistant minister for Environment, Natural Resources and Wildlife in Kenya’s ninth parliament.\n\nThe Guardian reports that things did not, however, go so well for her as she refused to toe the line or keep silent on some issues which saw her politically sidelined, and she lost her seat after a single term.\n\nFought Ovarian cancer\n\nOnce politics was out of the way Maathai's work schedule remained hectic and she managed to author a few books.\n\nIn 2011, Maathai was in and out of hospital bravely fighting ovarian cancer and Kenyans only came to know about it shortly before her death. '\n\nThe towering figure died On Sunday, September 25, 2011, aged 71. Her death touched people all over the world and she was eulogised by big names such as AlGore, Barack Obama, Jakaya Kikwete and trended on all social sites.\n\n\"Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her – as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model, and heroine; or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier, and better place,\" the statement from her organisation said.\n\nThe late Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised Maathai as a true visionary African woman and called her a leading voice on the continent.\n\n\"Professor Maathai introduced the idea of women planting trees in Kenya to reduce poverty and conserve the environment,\" he said.\n\nMaathai is survived by her three children and a granddaughter.\n\nTimes 100 women of the year\n\nA previous report by TUKO.co.ke reveals that the iconic Wangari Maathai was named among Time magazine's 100 women of the year in history around the world.\n\nOther notable faces in the list were singer Beyonce, Princess Diana, Indian first female prime minister Indira Gandhi among others.\n\nTime chose an artistic portrait created by American fibre artist Bisa Butler who used African Dutch-wax cottons to celebrate Maathai on International Women's Day.\n\nSource: TUKO.co.ke"
