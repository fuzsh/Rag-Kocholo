Dr. Wangari Maathai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her contributions to sustainable development, democracy and peace. The native of Kenya graduated from Atchison’s Mount St. Scholastica College, now Benedictine College, with a degree in biological science in 1964. She went on to become the first African woman to be awarded any Nobel Prize.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nThe Fellows will attend lectures from the region’s STEM professionals, gain exposure to other STEM fields and earn eligibility to compete for funding (awards of up to $2,000) to support a senior research project.\n\nExpectations\n\nFellows will be required to join a STEM-oriented campus club or organization\n\nFellows will be required to participate in two STEM-related outreach events per year\n\nFellows must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA\n\nFellows must make appropriate progress toward major requirements in a STEM field\n\nSeminar\n\nFellows will enroll in a one-credit STEM research seminar each semester during their freshman year, and for one semester of their choice during their sophomore year.\n\nThe seminar will consist of presentations made by regional STEM professionals and industry leaders from across various STEM fields. This course gives students weekly exposure to cutting edge research questions and methodologies from expertise outside of the College.\n\nResearch Project\n\nDuring their junior year, Fellows are eligible to work with faculty from their respective departments to generate a high quality research proposal for a Senior Research Project.
