        "text": "Kenya's Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai has died in Nairobi while undergoing cancer treatment. She was 71.\n\nShe won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for promoting conservation, women's rights and transparent government - the first African woman to get the award.\n\nShe was elected as an MP in 2002 and served as a minister in the Kenyan government for a time.\n\nMs Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, which has planted 20-30 million trees in Africa.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that the family of Professor Wangari Maathai announces her passing away on 25 September, 2011, at the Nairobi Hospital, after a prolonged and bravely borne struggle with cancer,\" the Green Belt Movement said in a statement., external\n\n\"Her loved ones were with her at the time.\n\n\"Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her - as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model, and heroine; or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier, and better place.\"\n\nThe organisation did not provide further details.\n\nMs Maathai, who was a professor of veterinary anatomy, rose to international fame for campaigns against government-backed forest clearances in Kenya in the late 1980s-90s.\n\nUnder the former government of President Daniel Arap Moi, she was arrested several times, and vilified.\n\nIn 2008, Ms Maathai was tear-gassed during a protest against the Kenyan president's plan to increase the number of ministers in the cabinet.\n\nThe BBC's Solomon Mugera met Ms Maathai a number of times.\n\nFor those who loved and admired her, she was \"Wangari wetu\" - our Wangari - he says. But for her enemies, she was derided as \"yule mwanamke\" - that woman.\n\nIn her speech accepting the Nobel prize, Ms Maathai said she hoped her own success would spur other women on to a more active role in the community.\n\n\"I hope it will encourage them to raise their voices and take more space for leadership,\" she said.\n\nThe President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, said she was saddened by the news.\n\n\"Africa, particularly African women, have lost a champion, a leader, an activist. We're going to miss her. We're going to miss the work she's been doing all these years on the environment, working for women's rights and women's participation,\" she said."
