        "text": "OSLO, Friday - Kenyan ecologist Wangari Maathai on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize, the first African woman to be awarded the prestigious prize since it was first handed out in 1901.\n\nMaathai, who has served as Kenyan assistant minister for the environment since 2003, founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977, the largest tree planting project in Africa, aimed at promoting biodiversity and creating jobs and giving women a stronger identity in society.\n\nThe Nobel Committee honoured her â€œcontribution to sustainable development, democracy and peaceâ€.\n\nâ€œI am very delighted and I thank God for everything,â€ Maathai, joined in Nairobi, told AFP. â€œI will carry on with my campaign and I ask Kenyans to join me.\n\nâ€œI wonder who could have forwarded my name to the Nobel committee, but God knows,â€ she added.\n\nMaathai said she had been informed earlier in the day by Norwayâ€™s ambassador to Kenya that she had won the coveted prize.\n\nMaathai, 64, is a biologist by training. She was the first woman\n\nin western Africa to receive a doctorate and become a professor. She is also an ardent human rights activist in Kenya.\n\nShe was elected to the Kenyan parliament on the Green Party ticket in December 2002 in the first free elections held in the country in decades. In January 2003, she was named assistant minister for the environment.\n\nThe Nobel Committee has for many years chosen to give the prize to people or organisations who have worked either to resolve conflicts by peaceful means or in defence of human rights.\n\nBut the Committee said in 2001, on the centenary of the Nobel prizes, that it planned to widen the scope of the award. Maathai is the first environmentalist to win the coveted prize, which comes with a US$1.3m package.\n\nAfrican Nobel prize winners\n\n2003: Writer J.M.
