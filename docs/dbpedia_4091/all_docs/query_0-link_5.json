        "text": "PARIS, April 2 — Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou, President of France, died tonight at the age of 62.\n\nThe time of death was given as 9 P.M. The cause was not immediately announced, but for more than a year there has been speculation about his health. Political uncertainty resulted as Mr. Pompidou reduced his work schedule and his Government temporized on many major issues.\n\nObituary is on Page 33.\n\nMr. Pompidou was initially a protege of Charles de Gaulle. He became de Gaulle's Premier, was dismissed from that post in 1968, but was finally elected on June 15, 1969, as the second President of the Fifth Republic, which was created by de Gaulle in 1958.\n\nNo Vice President\n\nUnder the Fifth Republic's Constitution, no crucial decision can be made without the President. There is no vice president in France. New elections must take place in 20 days at the earliest and 35 days at the latest after the presidency becomes vacant.\n\nThe election campaign is bound to be hectic and perhaps dramatic, since all the major contenders will represent significant changes from the policies set by de Gaulle and followed more or less faithfully by Mr. Pompidou. The rigidities of 16 years will be subject to Sudden erosion, and many of the major questions about the future of both France and Europe will be reopened.\n\nIn the meantime the President of the French Senate automatically becomes interim President. That post is now held by Alain Poher, who is not a Gaullist but a member of a centrist party.\n\nDid Not Name Successor\n\nThe race to succeed. Mr. Pornpidou appears wide open. Like de Gaulle, who died in retirement in 1970, Mr. Pompidou did not make known which man he wished to succeed him.\n\nThe significance of Mr. Pompidou's death to France will depend on whether his successor is one of a group of men standing roughly for the same political philosophy that he did —a liberalized Gaullism—or whether it affords a chance for the leftist opposition to win control of the presidency.\n\nThe leftists last held control of the government in 1938, when, the two‐year‐old Popular Front of Socialists and Communists was swept from power.\n\nMost prominently mentioned among possible successors and known to have presidential ambitions are the following:\n\n¶Former Premier Jacques Chaban‐Delmas, a member of Parliament, Mayor of Bordeaux and a favorite of the Gaullist party.\n\n¶Valéry Gisdard d'Estaing, Minister of Finance and head of the Independent Republicans, who are allied with the Gaullists.\n\n¶Former Premier Edgar Faure, President of the National Assembly, the more powerful house of Parliament. He has great appeal among the moderate left.\n\n¶The present Premier, Pierre Messmer.\n\n¶Foreign Minister Michel Jobert, who has become increasingly prominent after leaving the Elysee Palace as an important presidential adviser.\n\n¶François Mitterrand, leader of the Socialist party, who has the backing of the Communists.\n\n¶Clean ‐ Jacques Servan ‐Schreiber, a writer and publisher who leads the small Reformist party.\n\nMr. Pompidou was the 18th President of France in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics, which followed the downfall of Napoleon III in 1871.\n\nDuring President Pompidnu's last year in office his poor health became increasingly visible. At his increasingly rare appearances, his face looked bloated and puffy. At Cabinet meetings, according to witnesses, his temper was “terrible.”\n\nThe Government long denied that there was anything seriously wrong with his health. There was speculation that he suffered from cancer or from a blood disease. There has been no official statement saying what his illness was.\n\nThe speculation about his health set off endless conjecture about his succession.\n\nThe climate that resulted was not conducive to conducting political business serenely. There was mounting inflation, a crisis within the Common Market and another in transAtlantic relations.\n\nMr. Pompidou's last two political moves were inconclusive. On March 1, he accepted the resignation of Premier Pierre Messmer—and then reappointed him Premier in the same cabinet, minus a few of its members. Then he went on a short visit on the Black Sea to talk with the Soviet leader, Leonid I. Brezhnev, but later statements about that visit lacked substance.\n\nThis afternoon, he was to a have received the visiting head of state of Rwanda, President Grégoire Kayibanda. Then the appointment was abruptly canceled, and it was announced that Mr. Pompidou was returning to rest in his private apartment on the Ile Saint‐Louis."
