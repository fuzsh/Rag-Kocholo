        "text": "General Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle, better known as Charles de Gaulle (November 22, 1890 - November 9, 1970), was a French military and political leader. He was president of France from 1959 to 1969 and was a founding member and leader of the French Resistance during World War II.\n\nHis reputation as the strongest and greatest French leader since Napoleon continues into the 21st century.\n\nMilitary Career\n\nCharles fought in both World War I and World War II. He began his military career after he graduated from Ecole Militaire de Saint-Cyr (a famous French military college). In 1912, he joined the army's infantry. He was captured during the Battle of Verdun during World War I and was sent home after the armistice. Charles remained in the military after the war ended and supported new battle ideas. These ideas included mechanized troops (troops that travel in armored machines like tanks) and specialized armored divisions of the army.\n\nAfter World War II began, de Gaulle formed and led the Free French Forces movement. He did this because he did not think that France should surrender to Germany, part of the Axis forces. Charles de Gaulle thought that France should keep fighting. As the French government surrendered to Germany, de Gaulle fled to Britain. He set up his own French government there and called it Free France. He gained support and gathered French troops that would eventually help liberate, or free, France from Germany's power.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nAfter the war, de Gaulle retired as President of the temporary government in 1946. In 1958, he came out of retirement and was elected President of France - a position to which he was reelected in 1965 and held until his resignation in 1969.\n\nWhile de Gaulle was president, France recovered from the war and had great economic success.\n\nHe also granted independence to Algeria and the African colonies that had been under French rule.\n\nCharles wanted France to have its own nuclear weapons like the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union did. While he was President, France did become one of the four major countries that had nuclear weapons.\n\nLater Life\n\nDe Gaulle resigned from his presidency in April of 1969 after some of his ideas and proposals were not supported by many people in France. He returned home to his estate in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, where he passed away just two weeks before his 80th birthday.\n\nCharles de Gaulle quotes\n\n\"I have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians.\"\n\n\"I grew up to always respect authority and respect those in charge.\"\n\n\"Diplomats are useful only in fair weather. As soon as it rains, they drown in every drop.\"\n\n\"Don't ask me who's influenced me. A lion is made up of the lambs he's digested, and I've been reading all my life.\"\n\n\"Nothing great will ever be achieved without great men, and men are great only if they are determined to be so.\"\n\nInteresting Facts about Charles de Gaulle\n\nCharles de Gaulle was a general in the French army and the President of France.\n\nCharles served in both World Wars.\n\nHe was captured in World War I.\n\nCharles did not agree with the leaders of France, who were surrendering to Germany, so he left France. He went to Great Britain where he formed the Free French Forces.\n\nCharles de Gaulle helped free France from Germany's power.\n\nDe Gaulle served as temporary President after the war until 1946.\n\nHe was elected President in 1958.\n\nDe Gaulle resigned from the presidency in April of 1969 and died in his home when he was almost 80.\n\nImages for kids\n\nDe Gaulle's parents: Jeanne Maillot and Henri de Gaulle\n\nDe Gaulle's birth house in Lille, now a national museum\n\nDe Gaulle in 1897, aged 7\n\nDe Gaulle (back row, third from left) while studying at the Collège Stanislas de Paris, 1908\n\nDe Gaulle in 1908\n\nDe Gaulle as a cadet in Saint-Cyr, 1910\n\nA plaque in Dinant commemorating the place where Charles de Gaulle, then an infantry lieutenant, was wounded in 1914\n\nCaptain De Gaulle with another French POW in Poland, 1916\n\nDe Gaulle during the mission to Poland, c. 1920\n\nDe Gaulle at the École supérieure de guerre, between 1922 and 1924\n\n\"To all Frenchmen\": de Gaulle exhorting the French to resist the German occupation\n\nDe Gaulle speech plaquette on the Arc de Triomphe\n\nGeneral De Gaulle inspecting sailors on Léopard in June 1942\n\nDe Gaulle at the inauguration of the Brazzaville Conference, French Equatorial Africa, 1944\n\nCharles de Gaulle (far right) with Andrew McNaughton, Władysław Sikorski, and Winston Churchill\n\nAt the Casablanca Conference (14 January 1943), rival French leaders Henri Giraud (leftmost) and Charles de Gaulle (middle right) sit down after shaking hands in the presence of Franklin D.
