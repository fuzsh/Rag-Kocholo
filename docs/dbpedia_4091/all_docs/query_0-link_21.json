        "text": "PARIS—Even Charles de Gaulle dis ctvered that in democratic countries statesmen have to be successful politi cians to attain and hold positions of power. He also discovered that politics can be dirty. De Gaulle's successor as President, Georges Pompidou, is keen ly aware of both these facts as all important French parliamentary elec tions loom in early March.\n\nRecent months have seen a series of scandals involving members of the majority coalition which is already beleaguered by rising prices. And nasty innuendos have been spread by the opposition. One of these, published in a current book by Georges Seguy, chief of the pro‐Communist Labor Fed eration, quotes Pompidou (then Pre mier) as telling Seguy just after the May, 1968, student riots:\n\n“For my part I can assure you of one thing. I prefer to be a simple civil servant in a Communist govern ment than Premier of a France domi nated by the Americans.”\n\nPompidou insists he never said this and points out that a Communist France couldn't be independent; there fore why should he conceivably prefer a France dominated by the Soviet Union to one dominated by the United States? He did not record his conver sation with Seguy but contends he could have said—and now says—that for him the national interest is funda mental and he insists on the independ ence of France, whether Sdcialist or not.\n\n“Pompidou thinks there is vigor in Gaullism without de Gaulle even if it has no rigidly codified ideology.”\n\nAgainst this kind of background of insinuation, the President's opponents now suggest his forthcoming January trip to visit Brezhnev is politically motivated to woo votes away from the extreme left. Pompidou sniffs at the very idea, pointing out that indeed the most orthodox Gaullists complain his journey will make it difficult for them to attack the French Communists while he is visiting the Soviet boss.\n\nHere Pompidou clearly agrees with an observation attributed to the So cialist, Francois Mitterand, that the trip will have no influence on the elec tions. The President evidently intends to speak out on his return, emphasiz ing there is manifestly no link. His argument is that Russia exists, whether Communist or not, and that France's friendly relations with Russia exist, regardless of ideology.\n\nThere is nevertheless anxiety in the ruling coalition's camp about the drop in its relative standing in opinion polls. These show an increasing possi bility that the Communist‐Socialist bloc might gain an Assembly majority.\n\nThe first perceptible decline in the Government's position came when referendum was held last April 23 asking endorsement of British admis sion to the Common Market, Only 36.7 per cent of the electorate approved, There were 39.75 per cent abstentions.\n\nThe combination of noes and ab stensions showed a loss of about two million Gaullist supporters. Some Con servatives, remembering the general had opposed British entry, also op posed it in the referendum. But the Pompidou theory is that this faction was not very large.\n\nThe most important factor was that too many people stayed away because they assumed the matter had already been settled by the British Parliament's vote to join. To this group could be added those who wished to express discontent on unrelated matters: shop keepers unhappy with their pensions or artisans unhappy about taxes. More over, the referendum itself was badly couched and presented.\n\nDespite an apparent sag in enthusi asm for the Government, Pompidou (who has shown much political acu men) thinks there is vigor in the con cept of Gaullism without de Gaulle even if it has no rigidly codified ideol ogy. It stresses three basic ideas: in sistence on French independence, certain conception of institutions, and particular social concepts.\n\nTogether, as the President sees it, these ideas underwrite a liberal society with, at the same time, a mistrust for old‐fashioned capitalism. However, the three basic points are not neces sarily linked with each other; that is to say one could have true French independence whether it tended to be more socialistic or more capitalistic.\n\nGaullism, as the President tends to see it, is simply a method of adapting to events as they occur and on the basis of these principles. It does not nor can it have a precise code. But now that the general is dead, his suc cessors must define new problems as they arise and must also decide upon the requisite means of solving them.\n\nIt is impossible merely to sit back and imagine what de Gaulle himself would have done under one or another circumstance as it develops now and in the future. That would drive one mad."
