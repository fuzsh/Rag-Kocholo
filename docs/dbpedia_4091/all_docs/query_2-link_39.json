        "text": "PARIS, Nov. 10 — “General de Gaulle is dead. France is widow.”\n\nSpecial to The New York Times\n\nWith those Words, delivered in a trembling Voice, President Pompidou announced on radio and television this morning that Charles de Gaulle died last night at his country re treat in Colombey‐les‐Deux Eglises. He would have been 80 years old Nov. 22.\n\nDeath came to the wartime leader and peacetime Premier and President while he was playing a game of solitaire on a little card table in the quiet of his living room. Stricken with a heart attack, he col lapsed at 7:30 P.M. and is be lieved to have died of a ruptured aorta soon afterward.\n\nNo State Funeral\n\nPresident Pompidou, who succeeded the general as chief of state on June 20, 1969, was immediately informed, as were other high officials, but public announcement was held up until 9:41 o'clock this morning. The Cabinet met hurriedly in a somber atmosphere, and the President made his broadcast at 1 P.M.\n\nNo explanation was given for the delay overnight in the an nouncement of the death, but it was believed that Mrs. de Gaulle wanted to be Undis turbed in the hours immediately afterward.\n\nAccording to the general's wishes, no state funeral will be held. General de Gaulle is to be buried Thursday morning in the churchyard of Colombey les‐Deux‐Eglises in an “ex tremely simple” ceremony.\n\nA memorial service will be held at the same hour — 11 A.M. — in Notre Dame Cathe dral, and it is there that Presi dent Pompidou and other French leaders are to join with some SO chiefs of foreign states or heads of government— among them President. Nixon, Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union, Prime Min ister Heath of Britain—for last homage to the soldier‐states man.\n\nNation in Mourning\n\nOther leaders expected to attend include Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany, Em peror. Haile Selassie of Ethi opia, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and President Giu seppe Saragat of Italy.\n\nNational mourning until the end of the month has been pro claimed, and all flags have been placed at half‐staff.\n\nAs the mourning began, the French National Assembly ad journed its session. The regular Thursday meeting of the Viet nam peace talks was postponed for a week and the general conference of the United Na tions Educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization met and recessed.\n\nThe funeral arrangements were made in accord with what Mr. Pompidou read when he opened an envelope, on which was written “For Mr Funeral,” that was handed to him on Jan. 16, 1952.\n\nRuling out a national funeral, the general had said that only the French armed forces could participate officially, but in modest numbers. There was to be no eulogy in Colombey or elsewhere, and no places were to be reserved except for the family, members of the Colombey Municipal Counci and companions’ of the Order of Liberation—tthose who were the first to join de Gaulle in 1940, when he called on France to continue the war against Nazi Germany.\n\nBut the general added:\n\n“The men and women of France and of other countries of the world may, if they wish, do my memory the honor of accompanying my body to its last resting place, but it is in silence that I wish it to be conducted.”\n\nSpecial trains and buses were to take the thousands of people expected Thursday in Colom bey, and the National Federa tion of Road Transport asked trucks to stay off the roads leading to the Haute‐Marne Department, where the village of a few hundred people is situated, about 120 miles east of Paris.\n\nThe body lay in the living room of the Colombey house dressed in a brigadier general's uniform with the French tri color draped across it. At the feet was the Cross of Lor raine, symbol of the wartime Fighting French, and in the general's hands was a rosary given him by Pope Paul VI.\n\nDebit Is First Visitor\n\nAround him were his wife, their daughter Elizabeth, and her husband, Gen. Alain de Boissieu, and the de Gaulles’ son, Philippe, a navy captain, and his wife. There are seven grandchildren:\n\nThe first Government mem ber to arrive was Defense Min ister Michel Debré, the gen eral's first Premier and one of his most ardent supporters. Unable to go to the funeral because the general did not wish them to, President Pom pidou and Premier Jacques Cha ban‐Delmas are expected to visit tomorrow.\n\nIt became known today that de Gaulle lapsed into uncon sciousness on his collapse. His wife, who was with him, called a physician and a Roman Catholic priest, Canon Claude Jaugey, and they arrived as he was at the point of death.\n\nMr. Pompidou, in his tele vision appearance, looked and talked like a man profoundly affected by the death of the man who had brought him into public life and paved his way to supreme power. After say ing “France is a widow,” Mr. Pompidou declared:\n\n“In 1940 de Gaulle saved honor. In 1944 he led us to liberation and to victory. In 1958 he spared us civil war. He gave today's France her in stitutions, her independence and her place in the world.\n\n“In this hour of mourning for the fatherland, let us bow before the sorrow of Mrs. de Gaulle, her children and her grandchildren. Let us measure the duties that gratitude im poses upon us. Let us promise to France to be worthy of the lessons given us, and in the national soul let de Gaulle live eternally.”\n\nTheaters to be Closed\n\nAs part of the national mourning, radio and television stations abandoned their regu lar programs in favor of those with a solemn cast. Ordinary Frenchmen went about their business as usual, however.\n\nThe country is to begin drop ping its normal routine tomor row with the Armistice Day holiday. On Thursday all movie and legitimate theaters are to be closed, as are schools and •government offices.\n\nIn the National Assembly, many legislators heard the news only after their arrival for a budget debate, which was canceled.\n\nMarc Jaquet, head of the Gaullist group, called out to his associates “Children, Father is dead!” After de Gaulle's de parture from power last year, the Gaullist deputies were often called “de Gaulle's or phans.”\n\nThe Communist party, in a double‐edged statement, re called the general's wartime role and said, “His death could leave no Frenchman indiffer ent.” It added that he returned to power in 1958 at the head of “an authoritarian regime” in accordance with “the aspira tions of big capital.”\n\nWhile most comments of public figures were eulogies, similar distinction between the liberator of 1944 and the statesman of 1958‐69 was drawn by the Socialist Daniel Mayer. Guy Mollet, the former Premier who fought de Gaulle during the last decade, said that it was the wrong moment to discuss his place in history. , On the Avenue de Breteuil, Behind Les Invalides, hundreds of Parisians waited patiently in a light drizzle to sign a remem brance book in the hallway of de Gaulle's modest apartment office.\n\nThe man they mourned, leader who in war and peace refused to accept defeat or sec ond‐class status for France, had been out of power and virtually out of sight since April 28, 1969.\n\nOn the previous day, a Sun day, the French had rejected in a referendum one of the last of the great reforms he had con templated; a decentralization of power by forming regions and making over the composition of the Senate to reflect the new regional arrangement.\n\nHe had said he would resign if the proposals were rejected and toward midnight, as the re sult became certain, he an nounced that he would cease to exercize his functions as of noon the next day.\n\nFirst Memoir Appeared\n\nSo far as the public was con cerned, he was never heard from again until last month, when the first of what was to be a three‐volume set of mem oirs appeared. ‘He Made no pub lie appearances, except as tourist, and no public state ments. Offices were set up for him in Paris but he refused to occupy them.\n\nWhen the election to choose his successor was held, he went to Ireland.\n\nHe dwelt on the past, and those who watched him work on the memoirs reported that he did‐so with the intensity of a. man who was afraid death might catch him before he could finish. Only two chapters of the volume are complete, it is said. The first has seven chapters."
