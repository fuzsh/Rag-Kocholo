        "text": "“Of all the crosses I have had to bear during this war, the heaviest has been the Cross of Lorraine [de Gaulle's symbol of Free France]” – a mission that de Gaulle started and put his heart and soul into. The political struggle for de Gaulle began in 1940, and 1958 marked the year that changed the face of French politics making de Gaulle a man to be revered and loved in France and eventually becoming an epitome of inspiration.\n\nThe Fourth Republic was crumbling, pushing the French nation to political upheaval. The coalition government could not cater to French commitments towards North Africa, Indo-China, Syria, Lebanon and Africa. The French occupied Algerian region was also under scrutiny. Failures at various junctures were a predictable forecast if not resolved. The pressure was building up and at this juncture the prevalent President General Jacques Maccu – a Gaullist supporter, ordered the Commander-in-Chief General Raoul Salan to take the onus of provisional responsibility of French Algeria. General Raol Salan called out to Charles de Gaulle to take up the power reins of France and save the nation from the impending crisis. After much forethought General De Gaulle accepted the proposal to assume powers of the Republic.\n\nHowever, de Gaulle’s gesture to return to politics was not unanimously supported. Questions were brewing in the minds of the French nation. Nevertheless, De Gaulle’s gift of gab helped him to gain the lost faith in his leadership and intentions. He never tried to manipulate the civil rights and on the contrary he put his efforts in trying to re-establish them. Moreover, at the prime age of 67 he had no intentions of becoming a dictator; instead he asserted that he would accept power only from the legally entrusted entities constituted by the state. An answer - complete in conviction!\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis for the French nation worsened when Algerian troops captured Corsica and were rigorously making plans to attack a colony near Paris. The prevalent President, Rene Coty, urged General de Gaulle to take up the reins by becoming the last Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic. The General agreed to take up the role but put forth a condition to replace the Fourth Republic – the constitution that weakened the French political setup, along with emergency powers for the forthcoming 6 months. The clauses put forth by General de Gaulle were accepted by the National Assembly and he took an oath on 1st June, 1958."
