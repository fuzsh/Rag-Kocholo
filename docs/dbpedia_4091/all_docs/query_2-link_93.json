        "text": "Second World War showed France that they need political reforms and changes, with a devastating lesson. As all European states, France effected by devastation of the war, and needed long required recovery. The following to that the 4 th. Republic killed, by the most charismatic and most famous man in Europe at those times, in the name of recovering, the ideal France, and necessary France, for him and his followers, that man is none other than the famous general Charles De Gaulle. General Charles De Gaulle rejected the Vichy rule and protect French republic until end of the war, moreover, put efforts to increase his French state's recognition, more than Vichy France in the eyes of the allies. He succeeded in his efforts, however France never succeeded to take a seat in the table of the big threes that decided post war world in Potsdam and Yalta. De Gaulle eventually leaved politics for a time, after his demands rejected, however, there was a sharp change on French society in late fifties to end of sixties which was the period of crises and embarrassment for France. This research aim to analyse why Charles De Gaulle came to power in first place, what his foreign doctrine, and why foreign understand of France changed so drastically."
