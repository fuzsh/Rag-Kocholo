        "text": "PARIS.\n\nONCE the home of Mme. de Pompadour, now housing the President of the Republic, Georges Pompidou, the Elysée Palace in Paris is a build ing in refined 18th‐century taste: elegant and sym metrical, chaste without and ornate within.\n\nFrench politics has often seemed romantic, emo tional and theatrical. France wept even as it executed its king; it manned revolutionary barricades which brought tyrants into power. While the Left has been sanctified in word and sporadically in deed, the Right has been more truly representative of the national craving for authority. Only the extremes have drawn the passionate attention of Frenchmen and in a country which makes much intellectual capital of Reason, only the rational Center seems to have had less than a fair chance.\n\nAll that is changing now. France has become richer, more European, less grandiose and more bourgeois, if you like. Its last king was Charles de Gaulle and he, as if realizing that after him the race of kings would die out, left two bequests to the nation: one was the new Constitution and strong presidency which he created with such effort, and the other was naming as his heir the man who had‐been closest to him, in and out of politics, for the last 26 years of his life, and the man who, in his opinion, understood the new France best, Georges Pompidou.\n\nPompidou was not the man closest to de Gaulle in any romantic, emotional sense, as were the general's companions in the war, but he was the most central, the most indispensable for his sober skills and that homely, elegant, brilliant mind and manner that so perfectly mirrors the palace in which I recently talked to him.\n\nFor an audience eith the President one walks in off the Rue St. ?? into the Loge d'Honneur; a police man conducts one across the gravel courtyard to the vast double doors of the palace itself; a luckey in black swalloetails leads one up the ornate marble stairs where one is met by the presidential usher; he, chain of office discreetly settled on his waist, seats one in a large salon on a formal, uncomfortable chair and between two allegorical Gobelin tapestries repre senting October and March; then the President's aide de‐camp, a colonel resplendent in air‐force blue, his breast invisible behind campaign ribbons, his shoul ders under braid, accompanies one through the antechamber into the presidential office. It is solid gilt, walls and ceiling; the furniture is encrusted in gold leaf; the presidential desk, which could have been Mme. de Pompadour's, is covered with red leather and in perfect order.\n\nSo far, all is as it ever was. One was received in this man ner by Napoleon I and Napo leon III. Intervening revolu tions, periods of use as a print shop, then as a gaming house, have affected the building lit tle. Even with Charles de Gaulle residing there, finger ing the revolving globe and pondering on the world and France's place in it, there can have been little discontinuity with the past. But now?\n\nNow de Gaulle's globe is gone. It went the first day Pompidou moved in. Now be hind the President's chair, on a little stand of its own, stands a strikingly modern ab stract expressionist drawing: the economical, minimal cul ture of our times, one thinks, the taste that money can af ford. But then on a high chest of drawers of exquisite mar quetry, there sit photographs of Mr. and Mrs. Pompidou, their son and grandchildren, all in the special bright tan and disparate blue of sky that Kodachrome gives, and one thinks, ah, he is one of us! The man, just turned 60, tall, bulky, striped in suit, of sober blue, a blue tie randomly patterned and scru pulously knotted exactly bi secting his white shirt, steps forward to shake one's hand: this is the Pompidou whose discretion, modesty and finan cial cunning made him so ac ceptable to the politics and the money of the time that he could become both Premier of France and director‐general of the Banque Rothschild and seem to alter his basic self not at all. Then when he sits down, lights up a filter ciga rette and while talking leaves it dangling straight down from his lower lip, when one begins to listen to the deliberateness and pith of his conversation or watches him laugh, one re calls the stubborn, hard‐work ing peasants of France from whom Pompidou descends.\n\nSo at one moment the an den régime is still with us and Pompidou can say how he feels “completely at home” with “advanced” trends in the arts, with those painters whose works now hang in the palace, and then say, with a mixture of regret and lordliness, “No, I no longer visit painters now, I receive them.” The next mo ment he will explain the presi dency in terms of husbands and wives: “What is a quality in a private individual can be a defect in a man who has responsibilities. Lots of hus bands are good husbands be cause they're a little weak. Well, there's nothing worse for a head of government or head of state than to be weak.”\n\nThis blend of certainty and loftiness persists in many of Pompidou's declarations. When his party seeks to launch a “Year of Change,” Pompidou can refuse the slogan, saying, “Social change is not yearly, but daily.” Or, on quitting the premiership in 1968: “The busi ness of a deputy is to meddle with things and talk, and what I want is to stay at a distance from things and shut up.”\n\nTo spend any time in French intellectual milieus is to live in a world of loudspeakers and no receiving equipment: there is much talk and little listening and what counts is less what is said than the bril liance with which it is ex pressed. Pompidou's make‐up is absolutely typical of these circles in which he and his wife—who is both very much an intellectual herself and a mondaine, a member of higher society—always have moved and still do; yet there is a difference. One feels that Pom pidou could produce all that flash if he wanted to, but that he considers it both wasteful and foolish. He measures his words; he rations them. When they emerge, they are not bril liant words; they are simply clear, comprehensible and rea sonable. And it is obvious that he has that rarest of gifts among Frenchmen: the ability to listen, to doubt, to ques tion, to evaluate and hence to learn.\n\nTHERE are those in France who see in Pompidou Balzac's Rastignac or Stendhal's Julien Sorel, those heroes with the passionate desire to “make good,” and to Some extent this must at one time have been true of the man. But now Pompidou has arrived and in a real sense his is a “success story” of a kind that would not have been possible in pre war France. Not without some extraordinary deed: neither Rastignac nor Sorel could have risen as Pompidou has by sheer application, absolute self‐con fidence and so relatively minor an accident. And one might be tempted to think of Pompi dou's “making it” as a freak, a sport of the times, were it not that we can clearly see other “New European Men,” it the ascendancy: men as new as the united Europe of which Pompidou is such an ardent advocate, men as di verse and antithetical to their traditional national political and social patterns as Eng land's Edward Heath and West Germany's Willy Brandt.\n\nPompidou's grandfather tilled the poor, hard soil of Auvergne with a hoe. His son, Leon, as a shoeless peasant boy, was, in the educa tional reforming zeal of the Third Republic, as sought‐after for school as American blacks today are for business, facul ties or government. In the ruthlessly competitive struc ture of French education, to be called is not enough; one must also succeed. Leon suc ceeded — becoming first an instituteur, then marrying one and ending his days as a pro fessor of Spanish in a lycée— and his son succeeded even more brilliantly. “When I was 8 and I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, I answered without a mo ment's hesitation that I would be a normalien,” the President told me.\n\nTo understand what this meant—the flat declaration is still characteristic of Pompi dou, who seems never to have doubted that he belongs by right among the elect — one has to understand that the Ecole Normale Supérieure, like Sciences Politiques, which Pompidou later attended, is one of the Grandes Ecoles. These are particularly French institutions and can continue to exist and flourish only be cause France remains, of all modern nations, the most ab solutely centralized and hier archical. It is as though Har vard and Yale, or Oxford and Cambridge, were recognizably and beyond dispute the pre mier educational establish ments in their countries and that every young boy could aspire to go to them. To do so, he would take a national ex amination and be admitted— as well as, later, graduated— strictly on the basis of his rank in examination. Pompi dou was admitted No. 1 writ ten and No. 8 orally; he was graduated, naturally, at the head of his class. About which he said, again charac teristically: “The result didn't surprise me. Of course; I was pleased.”\n\nGraduation gave—Pompidou his agrégation — that is, his academic rank, but also much more. In France, this brings with it a position in society that is recognized and accepted not only by “top peo ple,” but also by the whole society; also, the graduates of the Grandes Ecoles form, at the apex of national life, not merely a network of connec tions, but also a society within a society that shares a com mon language, a common ap proach to problem‐solving and a common system for dealing with the real world. In the most literal sense, Pompidou was a man not only groomed for success but perfectly con scoius of the fact.\n\nThe only indeterminate in Pompidou's life as a young man in the early thirties was: In what field would success come?\n\nWould it be politics? No, at first it was Greek, then liter ature; later it was administra tion, then banking. “No, poli tics was completely an acci dent,” Pompidou said. But, Monsieur le President, you never thought of an active role in politics? “When I was a young man,” he answered, “I was interested in politics. I was not as extremely politi cized as some, but still com mitted. I was of the Left, of course. What young man isn't? Or of the extreme Right? No one took that seriously. One of my classmates could yell out, ‘Kill all Jews!’ … That was the way it was to be a Normalien. In 1933 I was a card‐carrying member of the Socialist party. I made a trip to Germany. I saw one of those massive Nazi demonstra tions in Munich. … Its power, its violence, its mass, its or der, its discipline, left an indel ible mark on me. I was hor rified and impressed. When I got back to France I tore up my party card. What could a political party in the Third Republic do to withstand such a force? Nothing. It was bet ter to turn away from politics altogether.”\n\nStill in that mood, having married the young law student (who was also the charming, intelligent and lively daughter of a successful provincial doc tor) he had met one day on the Boulevard Saint ‐ Michel, he lived, as he put it, a “pri vate life.” He fought the war, as long as it was still being fought by France, as a lieuten ant in an Apline regiment. Then, when it was lost, he lived through four long years of German occupation with out, he admits much more than superficial difficulty; a teacher of literature in a Pa risian lycée, at the Liberation he was preparing a critical edition of Racine's” “Brittani cus.” As for the romanti cism of the Resistance, the heroes both real and self‐pro claimed … “I hate all that business,” he said with a quick wave of his hand and sharp displeasure in his bright eyes, “I hate medals, I hate decora tions of all kinds.”\n\nUntil 1944, then, French politics seemed to him either futile or sick (and there fore responsible for the de bacle of 1940) or simply romantic. Charming but silly. Wasted energy. The institu tions for viable politics just did not exist at the time; they were not to come into exist ence until de Gaulle created them.\n\nIN 1944, de Gaulle, who throughout the war has been bereft of money, support, staff and power, returns to Paris to create a Government out of nothing. He needs men around him, he needs bright young men. A fellow Normalien, René Brouillet, who had been the head of Bidault's personal staff when Bidault headed the National Council for the Resistance, heard from Pom pidou—then 33 and beginning to realize that teaching would not satisfy his ambitions— that he was “looking for something to do, some job where he might make himself useful.” Pompidou meets the hero he, like every French man in his heart, has been looking for, his life is trans formed.\n\nTo Pompidou at first fall such tasks as drafting letters, writing memoranda, analyzing and reducing to order im mense, complex files, and the skills he learned were such as unobtrusiveness, brevity, ac curacy, unbiased evaluation, clear summary, style, loyalty, discretion. After much work and long study, Pompidou learns to operate as de Gaulle operates; he can take some of the load off the general; and he cultivates his own spe cial talents — especially those dealing with figures, econom ics being a subject that pro foundly bores de Gaulle. Dis cretion and loyalty, which are for de Gaulle the greatest (they are the most Roman) virtues, come so naturally to Pompidou that in all the years of their association, there is no single exchange of words between the two men ever re corded by Pompidou or by any third party. He is twice as useful to de Gaulle precise ly because he is self‐effacing and easily overlooked: the bright stars in the political firmament think of Pompidou as a superior office boy. He is never irked by this, for the mistake is theirs: the secret of success is to get on with the job, whatever it is, and, as he has said, “to let life come to one.”\n\nBut Pompidou is more than just “useful.” He has a great capacity for friendship. The man who starts working for de Gaulle unburdened with a past, either glorious or awk ward, who serves in a humble capacity out of conviction, goes on to become the friend who can be trusted with any task and who will always un derstand. In 1946, de Gaulle gives up power for the first time; nearly all his collabora tors at the period thought the general was finished; they left him to look after their own political careers. Pompidou continued to serve his master. He is de Gaulle's political sec retary during that first exile. By sorting out the raveled fi nances of the Foundation for Handicapped Children estab lished in memory of their dead daughter, Anne, Pompi dou earns the personal grati tude of the de Gaulles, and more important, the unswerv ing support of Mrs. de Gaulle. It is while working on behalf of the foundation (he is still its president), that Pompidou becomes friendly with René Fillon, who moves in the up per levels of high finance. Fil lon covets a senatorial role, Pompidou is able to assist. … As one of Pompidou's closest associates put it to me: “Pom pidou has always known how to make friends and how to keep friends. In all those years in which his chief profession has been government. I do not know a single friend or con tact he has ever lost. Each step in his career has simply added new contacts and new friends.”\n\nPolitical skill of a high or der. But after the 1951 elec tions, de Gaulle retires again to Colombey, and Pompidou, who has excelled at every stage of his career so far— the scholastic, the administra tive, the personal—now makes a third decisive change. “I could not see an administra tive career being a live, inter esting career for me,” Pompi dou has said. “I like the law, but I don't find it gives suffi cient scope for activity.” This time the general's return to private life seems absolute and final. Pompidou's similar return would have been equal ly final for any other man: he enters the Rothschild Bank, thanks to René Fillon, and once again he begins‐to ascend with dizzying speed; in no time at all he is director‐gen eral.\n\nIn 1958, there is the at tempted coup in Algiers; de Gaulle comes out of retire ment and “borrows” Pompi dou from his bank. After six months, as agreed, Pompidou returns tor the Rothschilds: “Despite the interest of the work, I still felt a sort of doubt toward the servitude of public life. …” In April, 1962, he is Premier. It is another switch, but it is no longer so great a leap. It is like mov ing to another chair, but all the rest remains the same, the milieu, the friends—artists, in tellectuals, politicians, finan ciers.\n\nA NEW man of this sort is in some way bound to be both enslaved by his superi ority and deeply conscious of it, and when Pompidou talks about his political peers, this sense of being a more com plete, more self ‐ sufficient man than they, comes out sharply. Perhaps‐because he is a classicist, he tends to think of character as being inextric ably mixed with history, and yet few men who have grasped as much power as he have been less concerned with “des tiny” or with their role in history. If there is any ab stract vision with which Pom pidou is closely attuned, that vision is the New Europe.\n\nHe has just come back from a weekend of wine and Lorelei on the Rhine and …I get the impression that the Presi dent thinks of the Germans as being preoccupied with thoughts of power. “Of course, they do not always do so con sciously. I do not think that with Hitler it was conscious; but with Bismarck, yes it was conscious.” And with Brandt?\n\nHis “summit” meeting with Edward Heath has been a per sonal triumph for both men; it has cleared the way for Brit ain's entry into the E.E.C. And yet, Pompidou recognizes that although he admires Heath, he finds him puzzling: “He is a complex man, not at all simple.” Perhaps a kind of British eccentricity, that pe culiar insularity, remains the main obstacle to the European ization of England: “Ah, yes, Mr. Heath, he has his yacht.” However, what strikes Pompi dou most is a feeling that he and Heath must have shared: that whatever one's ideas, real responsibility toward those ideas comes only with power. “Heath,” he says, “has been a European for 20 years, but it is only since he has headed his Government that he has really and truly been. con vinced.\n\nMr. Nixon might be, were he European, much the same sort of man. Of course, Pompidou says jokingly, though some Americans are very much Europeans, the ma jority cannot be: “They take everything much too serious ly.” He does not know Nixon well, but two things commend him to Pompidou. First, “I said when he was elected that here at last was the President who would finally extricate America from that disastrous war in Vietnam, and I was heavily criticized for doing so, but more than ever I believe that to be true.” And, second, Nixon's penchant for private correspondence between heads of state that bypasses proto col and routine; Pompidou says the correspondence is “regular” and “very useful.” (This correspondence appar ently didn't forewarn the French President of Nixon's new dollar policy, and when the surprise announcement of it came, Pompidou, obviously displeased, interrupted his va cation to huddle with his cur advisers.)\n\nPompidou's enjoyment of his job is apparent. That is why most observers seem to feel that, barring an unfore seen political crisis (which many feel could stem from the unrest of the young, from the lack of outlet for aspirations and ideals, or ultimately from an economic stagnation that at this moment in France is, unlike in the United States and Great Britain, no more than a shadow on the hori zon), or ill‐health, Pompidou is almost certain to run for re‐election in 1975: in a straight fight against the Communists and a Left‐coali tion led by Francois Mitter rand. It is a subject on which Pompidou refuses to specu late. Asked on a recent tele vision interview if he liked being President, he answered: “‘Like’ is the wrong word. I am possessed. … I mean ‘possesed’ in the literal sense. In the Dostoevskian sense. Don't forget that in Russian, the title of the novel (“The Possessed”] is ‘The Demons.’ ”\n\nThe presidency, then, is Pompidou's demon. But where is the anxiety, the fear, the real “possession” that drives the character Stravrogin to ever greater excesses?\n\nSometimes it is the very professionalism of Pompidou, limitless neutrality and com mon sense, that seems likely to cause him the gravest prob lems. After all, behind the Elysée facade, is France, is Europe, in such rosy shape? Perhaps not.\n\nHe has enemies. The de puties, shorn of their real power under de Gaulle's Con stitution, are restive; there are those who hold Pompidou's success against him, who see a sinister connection between high finance and political power, and those for whom he is the archbetrayer of Gaull ism, and his rivals for 1975, and those who whisper about land ‐ acquisitions through straw men. What can the ris ing generation of young men in France — whose economic freedom is threatened by the new giant international com bines, who feel their identity threatened by the abstraction of a “New Europe” they see as little more than a “market” which benefits the financial potentates and the poor hard ly at all, for whom political life in the‐Fifth Republic has become a politics of absurdity —what can they feel toward a man who says their prob lems “[don't] weigh on my mind?” That he is “concerned, of course, but their protest was perfectly natural” and that “they wouldn't grow up to much if they didn't pro test?” Who dismisses them, in short, as just nice kids?\n\nThe least the young are go ing to feel is that Pompidou does not speak their language. And that sometimes he speaks the same old language that French Governments have al ways spoken, the language of repression. “Order is respect for law, and law the expres sion of the general will,” Pom pidou has said. “But that be longs to a society of the past. We face a different situation. There are individuals and groups who deny not just the law but the expression of the law, who turn their backs on the elections by which the general will makes itself felt. And then, more and more, there is in the modern world a kind of need for violence. … The old outlets, colonial wars, explorations, are gone. … There could be general subversion, an attempt to overthrow the Government. … Well, I'd repress subversion with patience, firmness and, if needed, harshness. And then there is this generalized, scat tered, sudden violence. … One cannot foresee every thing. Ultimately order may be respect for law, but above all it's respect for human be ings, respect for others and self‐respect. Which is why order isn't in the streets; it's inside the citizenry and it de them.”\n\nTrue, these are the words of moderation, of a patient man. But to many they are also the language of an ad ministrator, a technocrat, a man who, for all his bonhomie, for all the smiles and friend liness he dispenses in his cere monial functions, remains faceless. Such people may conclude, as did one of his former associates, that Pom pidou is not at all a natural neutral, a moderate, a repre sentative of the new European Center, the rational consensus. “That face,” they say, “is merely the mask.” “Do not forget,” this man told me, “that men who have risen to high position in society, very largely because their society is organized in such a way that men can rise to the high est offices, have every reason to congratulate themselves: not only on their native skill and talent, but also on the nature of the society which made their ascension possible. They are bound to feel that society is, in fact, the best possible society, and they have every reason to defend its interests.” The answer that one might make to this charge is that, if true of Pom pidou, it may also be true of the majority of Frenchmen. Pompidou then emerges as the natural leader of the French silent majority.\n\nBeing President hadn't changed Pompidou in any es sential way. He still read a lot, he still had a private life, he had not ceased being an intel lectual. He still saw his inti mate friends; the same writers and painters and connoisseurs of the good life he had known as the director of the Roths child Bank, people like the novelist FranÇoise Sagan and the painter Bernard Buffet. They could come and dine with him; they could still talk freely. Of course, it was more difficult as President. Mrs. Pompidou was less restricted. On the whole, he had ample contact with the public; it was something he insisted upon. A President need not feel isolated.\n\nHe didn't think he was out of touch with the young. He had his son, who was now a doctor, and he saw quite a few of his son's friends: be cause he liked to see young people and because he thought talking with them “kept him in shape.”\n\nAnd, no: “There are some things that are less interesting than others, but, no, I am never bored.”\n\nSOME of the ambiguity which people see in Pompidou is undoubtedly due to the nature of the French presi dency itself. The “strong” presidency is still an innova tion but in many respects it seems like a repetition of the old: there's the cutting of rib bons and the bussing of Olym pic heroes, for the presidency is part ceremonial and part symbolic. The President is, after all, the nation. Certainly, de Gaulle was the living in carnation of that truth. But Pompidou?\n\nLike so many “solutions” to the perennial problem of poli tics in France, the Fifth Re public was created as a reac tion to its predecessors; the creation of a “strong” presi dency was based upon the scorn de Gaulle, Pompidou and most Frenchmen felt for the “parliamentary game” of the Third and Fourth Repub lics.\n\nThe innovation, not unsur prisingly, has worked well so far: the nation relishes leader ship, and voters a direct vote as to who leads them; the professional politicians recog nize and covet the greatest power. But that greater power has never been precisely de fined. In appearance, there are two parallel powers: the President and the Premier, Pompidou and Jacques Cha ban‐Delmas, deputy from Bor deaux and also mayor of that city. As for many years there was General de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. Pompidou is head of state, Chaban‐ Delmas head of the Govern ment. Pompidou is the apex of the nation, Chaban‐Delmas the pinnacle of a legislature of deputies, of ministers, of other political powers.\n\nThe two men see each other constantly, nearly every day. Pompidou is very precise about that. Punctilious even, as he was when he was Prime Minister and many mis takenly thought that because de Gaulle was President, Pom pidou was just his lackey.\n\nPompidou explained his re lations with his Prime Minis ter: “Chaban‐Delmas,” he said, “that's the daily business of the state. I don't have to do that; that's what I have a Premier for. Take the budget. That's an important matter. Well, once a year, it costs me two or three hours' work. But Chaban‐Delmas, for him it's 50, 100 hours' work.” The President, then, deals less with the formulation of policy than with decision. “Yes,” Pompidou answered, “ulti mately power rests in this office, but it is a question of how and when one exercises it.”\n\nWas there, I asked, a ré serve speciale, as there had been under de Gaulle? The President exclusively con cerned with matters of major moment, almost exclusively international, and everything else left in the hands of the Premier?\n\nAs head of state, obviously the President was especially interested in foreign affairs; it was he who had negotiated with Heath, who had just come back from meetings with Brandt, but it was not correct, any more than it was true with de Gaulle, that “the rest” was left to the Premier to handle. In the first place, everything is discussed mutu ally; in the second, while the President, like the kings of France, has the right of evo cation—that is, the right to say that such‐and‐such a thing shall not be discussed but is His and His alone to decide—the business of gov ernment would become im possible if the President inter fered, either too little or too much. “And those,” he added, “who think the Presi dent has too much power are always the first to demand that I exercise my power when it suits their own re quirements.” He was thinking, he said, of a deputy who had asked him to use his Presi dential power to prevent the mayor of a provincial town from prohibiting the showing of a particular film.\n\nPompidou's argument was that if a President was to be President of all the nation he must use his power sparingly, and mainly in those areas where it sprang naturally from the nature of the office.\n\nAs for his relations with the legislature and with “his” ministers, he had known “from before the war that power had to have another source besides Parliament,” but also that “Parliament was necessary.” A constitu tion had to check the pen chant of any executive toward authoritarianism, “which ex ists just as any parliament has a penchant toward anar chy. When the executive rules alone, the people tire of it … an elected legislature is there to prevent that happening.” He insists that despite rumors to the contrary, there is no “inner cabinet” or “executive staff” à la White House. parallel to the ministries.\n\nBut it is a curious sys tem and the French them selves do not yet see it very clearly defined. For one Gaull ist deputy on the left wing of his party, the division of powers actually seems to be as follows: each man respond ing to his own inner nature, Chaban‐Delmas had been as signed the liberal, progressive, socially minded sector, and Pompidou the traditional and conservative. Another said: “It is just as it was under de Gaulle: the Premier takes care of France, the President busies himself with the rest of the world.”\n\nIn his recent television interview, Pompidou seems to have cast himself in the role of the “heavy” vs. Chaban Delmas as “the People's Friend.” “By nature,” he de clared, “I am really a rather nice man. I like to please. And in the job I have …I seem to be forced to refuse all the time. … I find it harsh to quash demands that seem to me perfectly understandable and which seem, however, to be quite impossible to comply with. And yet I try, I try. … I remember a piece of advice General de Gaulle gave me: ‘Be tough, Pompidou!’ he said. I try, but I find it very hard.”\n\nMany I talked to seemed to find this explanation of Pom pidou as President a piece of calculated disingenuousness. But then in Paris you can find men to theorize about any thing: that the Republic will collapse because President and Premier are at war; that Chaban‐Delmas is Pompidou's lackey; that he is his stalking horse for 1975; that Chaban Delmas only tolerates Pompi dou because he himself is running for the presidency; that. …\n\nPOMPIDOU is ambiguous; the system is ambiguous; France in 1971 is ambiguous. But the “New European Man” is the one subject on which Pompidou himself is totally unambiguous; it is the only shred of ideology to which he seems genuinely at tached. Many see this “New European Man” as a creature of selfish interests; he is moti vated only by profit and not by humane values; he op erates as a great leveler, rub bing out national, regional, even individual distinctions; he wants to turn us all into one mold, to make us all into his own image. “No,” Pompi dou says passionately, “the New Europe cannot be all alike.” He considers it his most important task, in France itself, to decentralize, to allow of variation.\n\nNo. he sees the New Europe in a different way. “I see it more as a restatement of the age‐old quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns,” he says. “The Moderns claim pre‐eminence over the An cients. They have progressed further; they know more. But at what cost? What have they lost? Does the Modern really imply the tearing down of all tradition?”\n\nThe Europe Pompidou sees is, as he said on the Rhine, conservative, rural France wining with socialist, urban Germany, as if distinctions had vanished in a river mist. No, emphatically no, Pompi dou does not want the Mod erns to triumph by the de struction of the Ancients. “For me,” he says, “European Man is the man wno is con stantly renewing himself, and when I think of the Europe we are building, what comes to my mind immediately is the Middle Ages. I think of the cité, that good place in which all men know each other, in which there is a real sense of community, of be longing. And I wonder,” he adds with an ironic smile, cigarette—another, the third or fourth — still dangling straight down from his lower lip, “if I am not, after all, becoming a reactionary. …”\n\nTHEN, as I am ushered out the great double doors of the palace by the chamberlain with his chain and start down the stairs, I see on either side of me the Republican Guard, brilliant in their cuirasses, bandoliers, helmets of shiny steel and horsehair plumes, curved swords held motion lessly upright by their chins, arranged in a hemicycle. … I am supposed to exit through that? I take two steps back ward into the arms of the frock‐coated chamberlain. “Mail non, monsieur,” he murmurs politely, “It is quite all right. …”\n\nAnd it is all right. From the depths of a black Citroen emerges the Co‐Prince of An dorra—cloaked, shriveled, his mouth full of gold teeth and a bicorne on the top of his nar row head—come (as he and his ancestors have done with out fail since 1607) to pay his yearly feu duty of 960 francs to his suzerain, the Co‐Prince of France. ■"
