        "text": "PARIS — Manuel Valls seems destined to confirm an old rule of French politics: No sitting prime minister has ever been elected president.\n\nFrom stump speeches to TV interviews, Valls is campaigning in the Socialist Party primaries with all the joie de vivre of someone who just ran a marathon in shoes that are one size too small. François Hollande’s prime minister until last month, Valls doesn’t seem to know whether he should brag about his mentor’s record or criticize his failures while promising, of course, that change is around the corner. Polls rate his chances of winning the presidency as non-existent, and most don’t even see him making it to the second round of the general election in May.\n\nSometimes described as the worst job in French politics, being prime minister means getting the blame in the bad times and watching the president reap the rewards in the good. Worst of all, it’s not even a stepping stone to the top job.\n\nOf the three former prime ministers who declared their candidacy for the 2017 presidential election, one is already out of the race, and the odds don’t look great for the other two. Since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, when Charles de Gaulle resumed power and submitted a new constitution to popular referendum, prime ministers have mostly failed to win promotion.\n\nIn nearly 60 years, only two former prime ministers have been elected president: Georges Pompidou, who was de Gaulle’s prime minister from 1962 to 1968, succeeded him in 1969. And Jacques Chirac, who twice served as PM in the 1970s and 1980s, became president — on the third attempt — in 1995.\n\nNeither was the sitting prime minister when elected to the top job, and no outgoing PM has ever succeeded in becoming president. Three tried and failed: Chirac in 1988; Edouard Balladur, a conservative PM and Chirac ally who became his bitter foe, in 1995; and Lionel Jospin, the socialist who had been Chirac’s PM from 1997 to 2002 but lost badly in 2002 after National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen beat him to the second round, which ended with Chirac’s triumph.\n\nThe abundance of former PMs in the 2017 race doesn’t necessarily make it more likely the curse will be broken. Alain Juppé, who was prime minister under President Jacques Chirac from 1995 to 1997, got eliminated after losing in the conservative Républicains’ primary. That leaves François Fillon, who was prime minister under Nicolas Sarkozy and beat Juppé a month ago, and Valls, who held the post under Hollande and quit in December to take a shot at the presidency after his boss said he wouldn’t seek a second term.\n\nFillon is so far the polls’ favorite to win the presidency, while Valls is struggling in the Socialist primary against two of his former ministers, Arnaud Montebourg and Benoit Hamon. In an Ifop poll published on Sunday, Montebourg edged ahead of Valls and was predicted to win 52 percent of the vote in the case of a second-round primary vote against his former boss.\n\nAmbition killer\n\nSo thankless is the post of prime minister — and so ambiguous is the job description — that constitutional scholars periodically suggest scrapping it altogether. The incumbent is appointed by the president, which in the French system is the real seat of power rather than largely symbolic as in Germany or Italy, but still requires a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe French electorate sometimes puts the presidency and prime ministership in the hands of political adversaries, as was the case from 1986-1988 (there was a Socialist president and a conservative PM), from 1993-1995 (ditto) and between 1997-2002 (a conservative president and a Socialist prime minister). At such times, domestic power is concentrated on the prime minister while the president focuses on foreign policy.\n\nGiven the number of candidates who usually jockey to be prime minister, it may sound overstated to call it the worst job in French politics. But one of the reasons that prime ministers rarely get promoted is “sheer physical exhaustion,” according to Raphaelle Bacqué, a political reporter at Le Monde.\n\nBacqué back in 2008 wrote the book “L’enfer de Matignon” (“The Matignon Hell,” named after the prime minister’s official residence), where she interviewed most of the job holders. “Every single one of them told me the same thing: they end up physically washed-up,” she told POLITICO. Both Balladur and Jospin told her that, in hindsight, it was impossible to launch straight into a presidential campaign after a few years as prime minister.\n\nWhen François Mitterrand appointed one of his bitter adversaries from the Socialist Party’s ranks, Michel Rocard, to the job in 1988, he confided to aides that he’d done so to kill off his one-time rival’s presidential ambitions. It worked. Rocard never ran.\n\nShaking off the stigma\n\nPrime ministers also face what one former cabinet minister and veteran of several Socialist presidential campaigns describes as a “Catch 22” political situation.\n\n“A presidential campaign is won on a platform and a promise of change, not on a record,” he said, adding that the problem for prime ministers who want the presidency is that “they have to defend the idea of change and explain at the same time why they didn’t do all these wonderful things while they were running the government.”\n\nFillon had to shake off what one of his aides calls the “Sarkozy stigma,” so that he could criticize the former president’s record in office.\n\nValls is tackling that dilemma head-on by proclaiming that he has “changed” himself, and he now repeats some of the Left’s traditional mantra that he has been denouncing for years. It is a “mind-boggling strategy,” said one Socialist Party pollster who briefly considered working for Valls, but decided to wait out the primary instead.\n\nIn Fillon’s case, the five-year lapse since he was ousted from office together with Sarkozy means he has a stab at overcoming the curse and becoming the third prime minister of the Fifth Republic — out of a total of 19 since 1958 — to make it to the Elysée Palace.\n\nHaving declared his candidacy back in 2013, Fillon had to shake off what one of his aides calls the “Sarkozy stigma,” so that he could criticize the former president’s record in office despite the fact that he implemented his policies during five years as Sarkozy’s prime minister.\n\nThis was made easier, according to Bacqué, by the fact that “Sarko never hid the fact that he dissed Fillon — that he thought he didn’t have the guts to lead,” as well as by Fillon’s strange silence throughout his term as prime minister. When asked about Fillon’s role in his presidency, Sarkozy once described him as just “an aide” — making it all the easier for Fillon to pretend now that it had nothing to do with him.\n\nFinally, there is another trend that can literally hobble French prime ministers’ ambitions, according to Bacqué: They all suffer serious health problems during or shortly after their stint at Matignon. Be it heart problems, exhaustion, minor surgery or Fillon’s broken foot in a motorbike accident a month after leaving office in 2012, every one of them had to be hospitalized at some point.\n\n“He’d literally forgotten how to walk during those years — chauffeur-driven cars can do that to you,” remarked one of Fillon’s aides at the time."
