        "text": "France is known the world over for its cuisine, fashion, culture and language.\n\nA key player on the global stage and a country at the political heart of Europe, France paid a high price in both economic and human terms during the two world wars.\n\nThe years which followed saw protracted conflicts culminating in independence for Algeria and most other French colonies in Africa, as well as decolonisation in south-east Asia.\n\nFrance was one of the key players in European integration as the continent sought to rebuild after the devastation of World War Two.\n\nA former economy minister who had never held elected office before, Emmanuel Macron won the May 2017 presidential election run-off by a decisive margin over his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe former banker launched an independent campaign for the presidency little over a year before the election, and his En Marche! movement galvanised enough support from the centre-right and left to knock the traditional Socialist and Republican party candidates out in the first round of voting.\n\nThe following year saw President Macron's popularity fall as he tried to overhaul the economy, with major street protests in November 2018 over his attempt to wean the public off fossil fuels through price hikes.\n\nIn the April 2022 presidential election, Macron again defeated Le Pen in the second round of voting.\n\nPrime Minister: Gabriel Attal\n\nPresident Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France's prime minister in January 2024, in a move aimed at reviving his presidency with a new government.\n\nAppointed at the age of 34, Attal is the youngest prime minister in modern French history. He replaced Ãlisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office.\n\nThroughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament.\n\nThe appointment of Attal, the former education minister, does not necessarily signal any major political shift, but signals a desire by President Macron to try and move beyond 2023's unpopular pension and immigration reforms and improve his party's chances in the EU parliamentary elections in June 2024.\n\n507 - Frankish leader Clovis defeats a Visigothic army at the battle of VouillÃ© and conquers Gallia Aquitania (southwest France) forming the basis of modern-day France.\n\n732 - Battle of Tours: Frankish and Burgundian soldiers under the Charles Martel inflict a significant defeat on invading Arab armies.\n\n742-814 - Charlemagne expands the Frankish state and unites most of western and central Europe, becoming the first recognized emperor to rule from western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.\n\n987 - Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris founds the Capetian dynasty.

The war leads to a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fuelled by emerging nationalism on both sides.\n\n1415 - An English army under Henry V renews English claims to the French throne and decisively defeats a French army at Agincourt.\n\n1428-29 - Siege of Orleans: The watershed of the Hundred Years' War, taking place at the pinnacle of English power during the later stages of the war. The city held strategic and symbolic significance for both sides. The English besiegers are defeated by revitalised French defenders after the arrival of Joan of Arc.\n\n1453 - Battle of Castillon: decisive French victory ends the wear and sees England lose all its continental possessions except Calais, which France takes in 1558.\n\n1562-98 - French Wars of Religion: Civil war between French Catholics and Protestants or Huguenots. Up to four million people die from violence, famine or diseases. The fighting ends in 1598 when Henri of Navarre, who had converted to Catholicism in 1593, is proclaimed Henri IV.

He is assassinated in 1610 by a Catholic zealot.\n\n1620s - Huguenot rebellions against French state's centralising power and its increasing intolerance to Protestantism.\n\n1638-1715 - Louis XIV.
