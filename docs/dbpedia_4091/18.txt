Summary

Charles de Gaulle set clear objectives for France when he actively lobbied to bring the peace negotiations between the warring parties in the Vietnam War to Paris. Though, did Georges Pompidou safeguard these objectives when he succeeded de Gaulle only a year later? This thesis examines the mediatory role of France in the Paris Peace Negotiations from 1968 until 1973 in the context of de Gaulle’s objectives. Thus, this thesis not only looks at the mediatory role, but additionally looks into the French diplomacy accompanying this role. After all, France’s aspirations go beyond a simple mediatory participation. In that fashion this thesis takes on a new perspective with regard to the existing literature. As a result, this thesis comes to a different appreciation of France’s mediatory role as it brings forward that dans les coulisses France’s role and contribution have stretched further than previously acknowledged.
