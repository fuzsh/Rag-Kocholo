        "text": "David G. Knott, PhD is a Senior Partner in McKinsey’s Global Health Practice and leads the Firm’s Center for US Health System Reform.\n\nOver the past two and a half decades, he has worked with many of the industry’s leading stakeholders including health insurers, Medicaid health plans, health systems, PBMs, large employers, and health agencies. His engagements have focused on both strategy development as well as transformation programs, including the design and execution of future operating visions, organization re-designs, capability building programs, and M&A integration.\n\nDavid has published research on a variety of topics, including most recently: Understanding and Engaging a New Era of Medicaid Consumers; Accounting for the Cost of US Health Care; The Big Data Revolution in Health Care; and Maximizing Value in High Performance Networks. Over the past two years he has presented to the management teams and Boards of over 75 companies on the implications of health care reform and has served as a keynote speaker at industry forums such as the National Governors Association, AHIP, World Health Care Congress, Health Datapalooza, National Institute for Health Care Management, Medicaid Health Plans of America, Alliance for Community Health Plans, and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\nIn addition to his client commitments, David serves on the Advisory Board of the New York Metropolitan Opera, where in 2012 he and his wife, Françoise Girard, underwrote a new opera entitled The Enchanted Island, staring Placido Domingo, Joyce DiDonato, David Daniels, and Anthony Roth Costanzo. In 2012, they supported the launch of a new baroque summer music festival with Maestro William Christie in Vendee, featuring Les Arts Florissants and The Juilliard School, now in its fifth season. In 2013 David and Françoise sponsored the HD broadcast and DVD of a new production of Don Pasquale at Glyndebourne, starring Danielle De Niese. In 2015, they funded the PBS broadcast of the Chicago Lyric Opera’s commissioned work, “Bel Canto.” David also serves on the Advisory Board of Improbable, a UK-based theatre company with directorial credits that include two Philip Glass operas, Satyagraha and The Perfect American. In 2009 he was a David Rockefeller Fellow with the Partnership for New York City.\n\nPrior to joining the firm, David earned a Ph.D. and Master’s in Political Philosophy from Oxford University as well as a B.A. Honours degree in Canada from Queen’s University, where he was a Gold Medalist. He and Françoise live in Manhattan, where she is a lawyer and President of the International Women’s Health Coalition, a non-governmental organization dedicated to advancing the health and rights of women and girls around the world. She is also President of American Friends of Les Arts Florissants. David and Françoise share many passions in life, including a love of opera, travel, reading, art, fashion, skiing, cycling, fine food, and wonderful wine (especially Burgundian!).\n\nPresident James Gandre is an educator and musician with a deep commitment to students and the development of American conservatory learning. He returned to Manhattan School of Music (MSM) to assume the presidency in 2013, having served the School previously for 15 years (1985–2000), concluding that first phase of his time at MSM as Dean of Enrollment and Alumni. In 2000, Dr. Gandre became Dean of Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University, where he went on to serve concurrently as the Interim Dean of the College of Education, and ultimately as Provost and Executive Vice President.\n\nWorking with his colleagues on the MSM Board of Trustees, faculty, and staff, President Gandre has led the School to several far-reaching accomplishments since returning to MSM as president in 2013. Among them is an extensive reimagining of the campus itself that has seen the completion of nearly $40 million in improvements. The most significant of these was a sweeping $16.5-million renovation of Neidorff-Karpati Hall, MSM’s primary performance hall, and a related campus transformation that included the School’s grand new entrance, patron lounge, and three new entry lounges. Other campus improvements have included the upgrade and expansion (by 30 percent) of practice rooms; the creation of two dance studios and several new teaching studios and offices; and the creation of a new Student Union and Lounge.\n\nAdditionally, President Gandre has overseen the launch of several innovative new programs, including:\n\nan undergraduate degree program in musical theatre, the only one of its kind offered by an independent music conservatory in this country;\n\nthe Professional Performance Diploma, an individualized two-year course of study for classical musicians possessing a Master of Music or the equivalent that launched in fall 2021;\n\nthe Global Conservatoire, a pioneering virtual learning environment conceived by President Gandre and comprising MSM, the Royal College of Music (London), Royal Danish Academy of Music, and University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, launched in fall 2021;\n\nand, launching soon, a new Bachelor of Fine Arts degree completion program that will allow artists to convert professional experience into credits while studying asynchronously online to complete their undergraduate studies.\n\nIn 2018–19, President Gandre led MSM through a successful year-long celebration of its Centennial built around three anchor performances (an opening-day, multi-venue music festival, including Beethoven’s 9th Symphony; a fall gala reopening of Neidorff-Karpati Hall; a spring gala at Carnegie Hall) and hundreds of other performances throughout a season that celebrated MSM history.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic emerged the following year, under Dr. Gandre’s leadership, MSM effectively pivoted to online learning (in March 2020), following with a successful hybrid year of on-campus and online learning in 2020–21 and a full return to campus in fall 2021. And despite the ongoing pandemic, in 2020–21, President Gandre presided over the strongest year of fundraising in the institution’s history, an expansion of the School’s Board of Trustees, significant growth in its endowment, and, in fall 2021, its highest-ever enrollment (while sustaining its selectivity).\n\nThroughout the School’s response to the global public health crisis, President Gandre oversaw the evolution of MSM’s Cultural Inclusion Initiative, which was launched in 2019. Among the many programs that have resulted from that launch and MSM’s full embrace of the urgency of the Black Lives Matter movement was the Black Creators Initiative. The initiative mandated that all MSM performances during the 2020–21 academic year feature work by African American creators or those from the African diaspora. Going forward, building from the Black Creators commitment, MSM has instituted a policy requiring that every department incorporate the work of discipline-specific, under-represented creators and ensure that cultural inclusion permeates every facet of the curriculum and every performance.\n\nPresident Gandre has broad knowledge of the history and discourse of the American conservatory, the subject of his doctoral dissertation, And Then There Were Seven: An Historical Case Study of the Seven Independent Conservatories of Music that Survived the 20th Century. He has also written about conservatories and music schools in Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories that Shaped Our Culture (ABC-CLIO, 2013) and in the 2014 Musical America Directory. In addition to music schools, he has also written about higher education administration as a contributor in two books by The Johns Hopkins University: The Provost’s Handbook (2015) and LGBTQ Leadership in Higher Education (2022).\n\nAs a performer, James Gandre has appeared as a tenor soloist with the Cleveland Orchestra, London Classical Players, Philharmonia Baroque, and members of the San Francisco Symphony. His professional choral engagements include more than 175 performances with the New York Philharmonic, Aix-en-Provence Festival, Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Royal Concertgebouw, Israel Philharmonic, Warsaw Symphony, San Francisco Symphony, Orchestra of St. Luke’s, Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, Voices of Ascension, New York Chamber Symphony, American Symphony, and Opera Orchestra of New York. He appears on more than 20 commercial recordings on EMI/Angel, EMI/Capital, Teldec, Delos, MusicMaster, and Warner Records, and has made appearances on NBC’s The Today Show, PBS’s Live from Lincoln Center, ABC, and CBS. In these performances, he has worked under such conductors as Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta, Sir Colin Davis, James Levine, Mstislav Rostropovich, Riccardo Chailly, Robert Shaw, Edo de Waart, Christopher Hogwood, Roger Norrington, Dennis Russell Davies, John Nelson, Giuseppe Patane, Dennis Keene, and Eduardo Mata.\n\nPresident Gandre is a member of the Advisory Council of the Misty Copeland Foundation and is a member of the Recommendation Board of the Avery Fisher Artist Program. He was a voting member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (GRAMMYS) and has been a judge for the Region Finals of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. He was a panelist for the William Randolph Hearst Foundation/New World Symphony’s symposium on future multicultural recruitment for the orchestra and for the joint Andrew W. Mellon Foundation/Aspen Music Festival panel about bridging the worlds of musical training and future music performance. More than two decades ago, he led the effort to create the National Performing and Visual Arts College Fairs presented by the National Association for College Admission Counseling and served as the first and third Chairperson of the Advisory Committee.\n\nPresident Gandre has lectured at institutions including the Curtis Institute of Music, New England Conservatory, Oberlin College, University of Michigan, Peabody Institute, Mannes School of Music, Stanford University, University of Michigan, Royal Danish Academy of Music, National Orchestral Institute at the University of Maryland, China Conservatory of Music, University of the Arts, University of New Mexico, and Interlochen Arts Academy. For four years he served as the external adjudicator for graduation performance examinations at Australia’s University of Melbourne School of Music. He has also presented numerous panels on issues affecting LGBTQ youth and college/high school professionals at educational conferences.\n\nHe has served on the Board of Directors of Chicago’s Grant Park Music Festival, Chicago High School for the Arts, and the Auditorium Theatre. He has also served on the Board of Visitors of the Walnut Hill School for the Arts, the Board of Advisors for Music in the Loft (Chicago), and on the Diversity Working Group sponsored by the Elizabeth Morse and Elizabeth Morse Genius Charitable Trusts.\n\nPresident Gandre has been a consultant to institutions as diverse as Canada’s Royal Conservatory of Music, Chicago’s Institute for Clinical Social Work, and the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, and has served as a site team member for the American Bar Association’s accreditation division at City University of New York, University of Pittsburgh, University of North Dakota, and Indiana University–Purdue University.\n\nA Wisconsin native, President Gandre earned a Bachelor of Music degree with honors from Lawrence University, a Master of Music degree from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, a Doctor of Education from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and an Honorary Doctor of Music from his undergraduate alma mater Lawrence University. He also attended the Harvard University Institute for Management and Leadership in Education and pursued postgraduate music studies at the Blossom Festival School of Music/Kent State University and Manhattan School of Music.\n\nHe is married to Dr. Boris Thomas, JD, PhD, a psychotherapist and executive coach in private practice.\n\nRussian-American pianist Alexandre Moutouzkine is Co-Head of the MSM Piano Department and a member of the MSM piano faculty\n\nHe has toured as a soloist with over 60 orchestras across Europe, North and South America, and Asia. Highlights of those performances include appearances with Cleveland Orchestra, Berliner Philharmoniker, Israel Philharmonic and Israel Camerata, Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, Philharmonic Orchestras of Moscow and Kiev and Radiotelevision Orchestra of Spain.\n\nAs a recitalist and chamber musician, Alexandre has performed at Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium and Zankel Hall, The Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center, The Kimmel Center, Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv, Royal Hall in London, The Great Hall of the Berlin Philharmonic, Palau de la Musica in Barcelona, National Centers of Toronto and Montreal, Yokohama Minato Mirai Hall in Japan.\n\nAlexandre’s recital at Wigmore Hall was described by International Piano magazine as “grandly organic, with many personal and pertinent insights, offering a thoughtful balance between rhetoric and fantasy…technically dazzling.” Alexandre’s recital of Frédéric Chopin’s Études at the Great Hall of Moscow Conservatory was recorded live and released on the Classical Music Archives label in Russia.\n\nAlexandre has claimed top prizes at more than 20 international competitions, including Naumburg, Cleveland, Montreal, New Orleans, Shanghai, Iturbi in Valencia, Maria Canals in Barcelona, and Arthur Rubinstein in Tel Aviv. At age 19, he won the Special Award for Artistic Potential for his performance of Brahms’ Op. 117 Intermezzi. A Dallas Morning News critic described it as being played “more beautifully, more movingly, than I’ve ever heard them. At once sad, tender and noble, this was playing of heart-stopping intimacy and elegance.”\n\nOther career highlights include a performance of Rachmaninoff’s complete works in a six-part recital series with the Carnegie Concert Series in Nyack and the reception of the “Artist of the Season” award from Chamber Music International in Dallas.\n\nHis record of Cuban piano music released through Steinway & Sons was recognized by WRTI as one of the top 10 classical music recordings picks for 2017. It also won the Cubadisco award for the best classical music recording in Cuba. Alexandre most recently released a Steinway and Sons recording, “Ravel & Stravinsky” with violinist Chloé Kiffer. This album features his solo piano transcription of Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite, which debuted at Philadelphia’s Kimmel Center and New York’s 92Y.\n\nAlexandre has served as an adjudicator for the Concours International Genève Musicale, Bartok Competition in Budapest, Maria Canals in Barcelona, Santa Cecilia in Porto, Panama International Piano Competition, New Orleans International Piano Competition, and Vladimir Krainev Competition in Moscow.\n\nAlexandre is co-head of the piano department at Manhattan School of Music.

The young student-athlete quickly excelled in both pursuits, going on to attend the special performance arts school Escuela Libre de Musica at the age of thirteen and becoming one of the most noted young athletes on the island, both as a track and field standout posting record times in the 400 meters, as well as one of Puerto Rico’s most sought after young baseball prospects. Bernie was signed by the New York Yankees after high school in 1987. After working his way through the farm system, the switch-hitting Williams made his Major League debut with the Yankees in May, 1991.\n\nIn his 16-year career patrolling centerfield for the New York Yankees, Bernie Williams was a four-time World Series Champion and a five-time All Star. Williams has more post-season RBIs to his credit than any other player in Major League history and his resume also boasts four Gold Glove awards, six American League pennants, the 1996 ALCS MVP award, and the 1998 American League batting title. Bernie is also among the Yankees all-time leaders in every major batting category, with his performance statistics often standing alongside such legetnds as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. On May, 24, 2015, the Yankees retired Bernie’s uniform number 51 and a plaque was dedicated and placed in Monument Park in Yankee Stadium, cementing his legacy as an all-time Yankee great.\n\nThroughout Williams’ years with the Yankees, his passion for music never waned, and the sound of his guitar would often be heard emanating from the clubhouse or during team flights. Whether acoustic or electric, a guitar was a constant presence in the star’s locker or equipment bag, and it was no surprise when he demonstrated how serious his musical pursuit was with the release of his first album, The Journey Within in 2003. The record featured fusions of jazz, rock and the tropical rhythms of Williams’ Latin heritage and was met with both strong critical praise and instant chart success- reaching #3 on Billboard’s “Contemporary Jazz Chart.”\n\nBernie Williams raised his musical game even further with the release of his second album Moving Forward. Featuring guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Secada, Dave Koz, and an All-Star cast of renowned studio musicians, Moving Forward debuted as Billboard’s #2 Contemporary Jazz album in the country, and continued to hold that chart position for five straight weeks, and spawned two consecutive Billboard #1 singles, Go For It, and Ritmo de Otono. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Album in 2009.\n\nIn addition to performing at concert venues, music festivals, and special events, since the release of Moving Forward, Bernie spent considerable time authoring his first book, Rhythms of the Game: The Link Between Music and Athletic Performance, published by Hal Leonard Books and released in July 2011. The book examines the symbiotic relationship between musical artistry and athletic performance through the eyes of a man who has mastered both.\n\nBernie is an active crusader for arts and music education in the lives of all students, and is a national spokesman for the NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Foundation’s SupportMusic Coalition, which unites non-profit organizations, schools, and businesses working to assure that music education is supported in communities everywhere, and that all children have the opportunity to learn and grow with music. He has met with leaders of Congress on Capitol Hill for years lobbying to ensure that arts and music become part of a core education in our schools across the United States.\n\nIn 2015, he was appointed a Turnaround Arts artist by the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with the White House, and U.S. Department of Education. Turnaround Arts brings arts education programs and supplies to a group of the lowest-performing elementary and middle schools in the country. These resources help schools improve attendance, parent engagement, student motivation, and academic achievement.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Williams graduated from the Manhattan School of Music, in New York, NY, a prestigious music conservatory in New York, NY, receiving a Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Performance.\n\nIn 2017, Bernie became the national spokesperson for Breathless, an educational awareness campaign for Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a mysterious lung disease that took the life of Bernie’s father Bernabe Sr., and still has no cure. He has been touring the country visiting many cities, Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball ballparks, and speaking at major medical conferences to spread the word about the disease that affects up to 132,000 people and their families per year.\n\nOn June 13, 2019, Bernie became “Dr. Williams”, as he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the State University of New York through SUNY Potsdam and the world- renowned Drake School of Music, considered the “birthplace of music education”. Williams was recognized for his record-setting achievements as a New York Yankee, as well as his artistic accomplishments as a musician and dedication to philanthropy."
