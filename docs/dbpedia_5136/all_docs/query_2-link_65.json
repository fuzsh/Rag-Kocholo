        "text": "It Happened in 1965\n\nLame Duck Braves\n\nAfter continually denying rumors of a move to Atlanta, Milwaukee Braves officials are exposed in media reports as, indeed, covertly preparing to relocate to the Deep South. Both the local courts and the National League tell the Braves they must honor their existing lease and stay put in Milwaukee for 1965 before heading to Atlanta. Incensed Milwaukee fans mostly stay home during the team’s final year in Wisconsin, as the team that Milwaukee helped break the two-million barrier in attendance a decade earlier can only attract 555,000—despite a competitive 86-76 record and a high-profile lineup that includes Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews and Joe Torre.\n\nFeeling the Draft\n\nThe first major league amateur draft is held on June 8. Drawing from a pool of high school and college prospects as well as players not yet chained to the reserve clause, the draft is designed to put an end to the “bonus babies”—prospects earning huge sums of money from the highest bidder—while bringing some parity to the game. The Kansas City A’s select Arizona State sophomore Rick Monday as the first player chosen; also picked early on are Nolan Ryan (by the New York Mets) and Johnny Bench (by the Cincinnati Reds). The New York Yankees—whose lofty standing routinely lured the best available prospects in pre-draft times—raise the biggest stink over the new process, and many believe it will deepen the funk they settle into starting in 1965.\n\nBranch Rickey, 1881-1965\n\nWhile giving a speech to accept his entry into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Branch Rickey stops, quietly says, “I don’t believe I’m going to be able to speak any longer,” and collapses. Unable to regain consciousness, Rickey passes away of a heart attack at age 83. He was undoubtedly one of baseball’s most influential individuals, a colossal force in advancing the farm system and racial integration all while bringing three organizations to prominence: The Cardinals of the 1920s, the Dodgers of the 1940s, and the Pirates of the 1960s.\n\nA Paige Out of the Book of Lore\n\nSatchel Paige, age 59 (or so we’re told), returns to the mound 12 years after his last major league appearance to pitch the first three innings of the A’s September 25 game against the Boston Red Sox. Paige becomes the oldest player to perform in a big league game, and he’s not too shabby—allowing just one hit (a double by Carl Yastrzemski) and striking out one. The younger A’s pitchers are not as sharp and allow the Red Sox to score a 5-2 win.\n\nMaking the Mistake of Being 75\n\nAfter breaking both his wrist and hip in separate accidents during the season, 75-year-old Casey Stengel decides to bid farewell to the game of baseball. He announces his retirement on August 30, unable to finish his fourth year as manager of the Mets—with whom he will accrue an atrocious 175-404 record.\n\nCampaneris, ss-2b-3b-lf-cf-rf-ib-p-c\n\nSecond-year Kansas City shortstop Bert Campaneris is the first major leaguer to play all nine positions in one game, during a 5-3, 13-inning win over the Los Angeles Angels on September 8. Campaneris plays a different position in every inning, and realizes how tough it can be playing elsewhere; he drops a fly ball in right field, allows a run on a hit and two walks pitching, and barely survives a home-plate collision playing catcher in the ninth inning, prematurely ending his night.\n\nGame of the Year\n\nSandy Koufax tosses his fourth career no-hitter—and his only perfect game—on September 9 in a 1-0 Dodgers victory over the Chicago Cubs at Los Angeles. Opposing pitcher Bob Hendley emerges as a hard-luck loser; he allows just one hit, a Lou Johnson single in the seventh inning, in going the distance. The one hit, two baserunners and one runner left on base combined by both teams establish all-time major league lows for a game.\n\nWhen Being Your Best Isn’t Enough…\n\nCincinnati pitcher Jim Maloney takes a no-hitter into the 11th inning at New York, but loses both the no-no and the game, 1-0, when leadoff hitter Johnny Logan connects for a game-winning homer for the Mets on June 14. Maloney strikes out 18 and walks only one.\n\n…And When It is Enough\n\nOn August 19, Maloney again has to take a no-hitter into extra innings, but this time prevails. He’s more erratic—walking 10 batters and hitting another while striking out 12—but he’s finally supported when teammate Leo Cardenas hits a home run in the top of the 10th to beat the Cubs at Chicago, 1-0.\n\nSpike Heel\n\nAfter 15 years as commissioner, Ford Frick steps down and is replaced by William “Spike” Eckert—who will ultimately go down as the most unknowledgeable and weakest of baseball’s leaders.\n\nFrank v. Richie\n\nIn a racially charged clash of abrasive personalities, veteran slugger Frank Thomas and second-year phenom Richie Allen of the Philadelphia Phillies fight it out during batting practice on July 3. The incident allegedly starts out as innocent kidding around before it takes a turn for the worse—with Thomas using his bat on Allen’s shoulder. Allen, who is black, claims that Thomas, who is white, was needling him with racist taunts. The 36-year-old Thomas is given his release that same day from the Phillies, and later winds up with the Houston Astros; Phillies fans will blame Allen for Thomas’ release, beginning a love-hate affair that lasts for the rest of his Philadelphia tenure.\n\nThe Inside-the-Park Scoop\n\nYankees pitcher Mel Stottlemyre becomes the first hurler to hit an inside-the-park grand slam since 1910 when he clears the bases on July 20 against the Red Sox. The slam helps him earn one of his 20 victories for the season, 6-3.\n\nNEW BALLPARKS\n\nThe Astrodome, Houston\n\nLauded as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the Astrodome was certainly unlike anything baseball had ever seen: A domed facility with cushioned seats, a monstrous scoreboard that put Comiskey Park’s exploding version to shame, a bowling alley, a beauty salon, a shooting gallery, a chapel, and a garish Presidential suite. It also introduced the sports world to the modern age of luxury boxes. On the field, conditions were less comforting for the players. The intense glare of the ceiling’s translucent panels made catching fly balls an adventure; when the panels were painted over to cut down on the sunlight, the natural grass quickly died out. The Astros, newly renamed in their $32 million home, had to make do playing on dead, painted grass for much of the year before the dubious advent of artificial turf in 1966. Still, the air-conditioned Astrodome removed fans from the intense Texas summer heat and famed mosquitoes, helping the ninth-place (65-97) Astros attract over 2 million fans. Abandoned by the Astros after 1999, the facility hosted numerous other events through 2009; it remains standing as local officials determine its fate.\n\nAtlanta-Fulton County Stadium, Atlanta"
