        "text": "The Columbia Broadcasting System has purchased an 80 per cent interest in the New York Yankee baseball organization from Daniel R. Topping and Del E. Webb. Mr. Topping and Mr. Webb retained 20 per cent of the stock.\n\nThe acquisition of a major sports power by a major broadcasting power was confirmed yesterday by Joe Cronin, the president of the American League.\n\nHe said that the league had been “advised that if approval was granted, the New York Yankees will be a separate entity and an autonomous organization independent of C.B.S., with Dan Topping as president and other members of the organization continuing to formulate policy and manage the Yankee organization.”\n\nLeague approval was not unanimous. Charles O. Finley, the owner of the Kansas City Athletics, and Arthur Allyn, the owner of the Chicago White Sox, were outspoken in their dissent. But the eight other franchises, including the Yankees, gave the necessary threequarters approval in a vote by telegram and mail conducted by Mr. Cronin.\n\nFord Frick, the commissioner of baseball who is vacationing in Colorado Springs, said, “I know nothing about it.”\n\nC.B.S. and the Yankees neither confirmed nor denied the sale, which was revealed by Mr. Finley in Kansas City.\n\nDr. Frank Stanton, the president of C.B.S., said, “I have reasons why I cannot comment at this time.” Both parties said an announcement would be made today.\n\nThe proposed sale was thrust at the league owners in a quick move that followed the summer meeting at Chicago on Monday. Finley said the proposal had not arisen at the meeting but had been presented in the form of a letter from Cronin. The owners had been asked to approve the following:\n\n“The transfer of membership in the American League from the New York Yankees, partnership, to the New York Yankees, Inc., and the transfer of 80 per cent of the stock ownership in the New York Yankees, Inc., to Columbia Broadcasting, Inc.\n\n“Messrs. Dan Topping and Del Webb are retaining 20 per cent stock ownership of the New York Yankees, Inc. Mr. Topping Sr. has a long term management contract.”\n\nDaniel R. Topping Jr. is assistant to the Yankee general manager, Ralph Houk.\n\nTopping and Webb were partners in the ownership of baseball's most successful enterprise. The assets of the Yankees consist of the players on the parent team and the farm‐club affiliates, but not Yankee Stadium. The team sold the Stadium several years ago and leases it from the current owner, Rice University of Houston.\n\nTopping and Webb changed the structure of their ownerShip from a partnership to a corporation with the sale. The price has not been revealed, but a conservative estimate would be $15 million,\n\nThe ownership of a baseball team by a broadcasting company could bring up several problems. Ed Short, the general manager of the White Sox, said he had withheld his approval of the purchase “because of ramifications regarding open television‐radio bidding on the World Series, the All‐Star Game and the Game‐of‐the‐Week program.”\n\nShort said he had requested a league meeting to discuss these problems, and added that he might not be against the sale if he receives satisfactory answers.\n\nAllyn said in Chicago:\n\n“It's a hell of a way to run a league. I don't like to be called at 11:45 about something and be asked to approve it in three hours. I understand the subject was under discussion in the league office last Saturday and we had plenty of opportunity to discuss it at our league meeting Monday. I know Joe Cronin is put out with me because I told him so. He can get mad all he wants because I'm just a little bit madder.”\n\nThe fiery Finley, who has often been opposed by the other owners, was far more outspoken. He described the transaction as “just another perfect example of the shenanigans of the American League president and the New York Yankees.”\n\n“I'm confused and concerned,” he said. “I feel that we owners should have had an opportunity to hear the proposal and to ask questions. I think I am entitled to that courtesy and consideration as a partner, and I have not received it.”\n\nFinley may wait a long time. His negative vote and that of Short were not enough to turn down the proposal. Of the ten teams concerned, eight affirmative votes were needed and they came from the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the Baltimore Orioles, the Los Angeles Angels, the Minnesota Twins, the Detroit Tigers, the Washington Senators and the Yankees.\n\nTelevision and baseball are in business together, and the scope of their common interests seems likely to widen. The World Series, the highest priced sports event carried by television, is open for bids between networks. The National Broadcasting Company, C.B.S.'s primary competitor, has, for several years, carried the World Series (for $3.5 million) and the All‐Star Game.\n\nBoth C.B.S. and N.B.C. have game ‐ of ‐ the ‐ week programs that present major league games Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Yankees are seen more often on the C.B.S. game‐of‐the‐week than any other team, and the broadcasting company pays the Yankees $500,000 annually for the rights to the games.\n\nHome games of the Yankees and some road contests are currently televised by an independent station here, WPIX, with the contract extending through 1966.\n\nRadio broadcasts of the Yankees are carried locally by the C.B.S. affiliate, WCBS.\n\nWith control of the Yankees, C.B.S. will have a strong voice in the American League's future television and radio commitments. The major leagues are considering a package of weekly Monday night games for national prime‐time exposure, and the three major networks are expected to bid for this package, one that might sell for as much as $20 million.\n\nFrom a long‐range standpoint, the major leagues must consider the uses of pay‐television C.B.S., in company with the National and American Broadcasting Companies, have been stanch opponents of pay‐television. C.B.S. now will he in a position to carry its opposition into the inner sanctums of baseball.\n\nThe purchase is in keeping with a C.B.S. plan of diversification. Two years ago, the company appointed Michael Burke as vice president for the fulltime exploration and study of diversification opportunities.\n\nThe Yankees, the dominant power in baseball for more than 40 years, are a valuable property.\n\nYankee profits under Webb and Topping have never been revealed but are assumed to have been large ones. The new arrangement may mean the end of Webb's association with the team. He has played a small role in its operation since the departure in 1960 of George Weiss, the long‐time general manager, and Casey Stengel, the manager."
