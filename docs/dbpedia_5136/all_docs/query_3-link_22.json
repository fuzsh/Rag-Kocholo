        "text": "Welcome to the SP Roundup, my daily fantasy baseball article reviewing every starting pitcher’s performance from every Tuesday game. I apologize for the jokes written in my delirium in advance. Have questions? Ask me during my office hours on Playback.tv weekday mornings from 10 am-12 pm ET.\n\nColin Rea (MIL) @ ATL (W) – 7.0 IP, 0 ER, 5 Hits, 1 BBs, 9 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 36% CSW, 92 pitches.\n\nUhhhh Colin Rea had himself another gem tonight. Colin made a mockery of Atlanta via 7.0 IP, 0 ER, 5 Hits, 1 BBs, 9 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 36% CSW, 92 pitches, earning a King Cole and the interest of fantasy managers everywhere with his fourth excellent outing in a row – a stretch totaling just 4 ER in 22.1 IP. Pretty bonkers.\n\nThis was the best one I saw. His command was fantastic, with sinkers along the edges, sweepers and cutters at the corners, and the rare four-seamer, curve, or splitter when needed. He didn’t give in to Atlanta batters, and he made them swing at what he wanted them to chase. The dude pitched and squeezed the most out of his arsenal.\n\nIt’s a standard Vargas Rule where a middling stuff pitcher is in rhythm, allowing him to succeed through precision. It usually doesn’t last long, but with the Reds up next, you may as well jump on for the ride.\n\nLet’s see how every other SP did Tuesday:\n\nAlbert Suárez (BAL) @ TOR (ND) – 5.0 IP, 0 ER, 2 Hits, 2 BBs, 6 Ks – 11 Whiffs, 29% CSW, 73 pitches.\n\nHot dang, look at you! Suárez deserves today’s Gold Star as he pulled off a classic Clerks – he wasn’t supposed to be here today with Grayson Rodriguez getting scratched during his warmups due to lat/teres discomfort. That sounds bad. It sure does. We’ll find out more tomorrow or Thursday as he heads for MRI imaging. Yaaaaay. As for Suárez, this was his typical jam of elevated four-seamers and a sprinkle of secondaries and I’m glad it worked out in this one. Maybe he’s worth it against the Rays next, though that could be Cade Povich in his spot or even Grayson if he checks out clean. Feel free to circle it (solid Win chance, even at 80 pitches), but I wouldn’t stash for it now.\n\nBailey Falter (PIT) vs SDP (ND) – 2.0 IP, 0 ER, 2 Hits, 0 BBs, 1 Ks – 2 Whiffs, 30% CSW, 20 pitches.\n\nThe rain trickled down over Falter’s cap. The sky’s tears mask my own. The grass glistened below as he trudged toward the dugout, the blades’ quenched thirst betraying Falter’s anger. I’ll show them soon enough. The scoreboard flashed RAIN DELAY. I’ll show them the real Bailey Special. Nah, you probably won’t Falter, but that’s alright. Sorry this one rained out, go get em next time. I’LL SHOW THEM.\n\nDylan Cease (SDP) @ PIT (ND) – 1.0 IP, 0 ER, 1 Hits, 0 BBs, 2 Ks – 2 Whiffs, 43% CSW, 14 pitches.\n\nAces gonna MAKE US WAIT. Stupid rain. Looks like Cease won’t start again until the weekend, effectively skipping this turn in the rotation. Womp womp.\n\nCristopher Sánchez (PHI) @ LAD (ND) – 6.0 IP, 1 ER, 5 Hits, 1 BBs, 2 Ks – 7 Whiffs, 16% CSW, 89 pitches.\n\nWe’ll take this all day against the Dodgers. Exhale and feel good with the Diamondbacks up next.\n\nJonathan Cannon (CHW) @ OAK (W) – 6.0 IP, 1 ER, 6 Hits, 2 BBs, 5 Ks – 9 Whiffs, 23% CSW, 96 pitches.\n\nAyyyy, it worked! Cannon earned the South Side its first Win in 22 games (WOW) on the back of sinkers, sweepers, and cutters well inside the zone. Now it’s the Yankees and that ain’t gonna fly again. Back to the wire you go.\n\nKeider Montero (DET) @ SEA (W) – 6.0 IP, 1 ER, 4 Hits, 1 BBs, 8 Ks – 12 Whiffs, 26% CSW, 85 pitches.\n\nI heavily considered Montero for the streaming pick and while Cannon still came through, Montero CAME THROUGH. I dug the Dancing With The Disco approach, merged with heaters around the edges of the zone, but 4/11 curveballs for strikes needs to be fixed moving forward. Blame it on the Mariners, y’all. That doesn’t mean I’m totally out on him against the Giants, but don’t get carried away as if Montero is your answer. Narrator: He’s not.\n\nTyler Mahle (TEX) vs HOU (L) – 5.0 IP, 1 ER, 5 Hits, 1 BBs, 2 Ks – 7 Whiffs, 30% CSW, 76 pitches.\n\nHe’s back from TJS and looked pretty decent. 16-17″ of iVB on the heater at 92/93 mph and great command upstairs + splitters in the zone and middling sliders off the plate. I’m not too into Mahle and don’t love him for his next outing in Fenway, but there’s something decent here that should help 12-teamers after the next start or two. Whaaaat, he just helped my twelve-teamer! Okay fair. I’m talking sustainably helping. Suuuuuure. WHATEVER, DO WHAT YOU WANT.\n\nClayton Kershaw (LAD) vs PHI (ND) – 4.2 IP, 1 ER, 5 Hits, 0 BBs, 5 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 26% CSW, 81 pitches.\n\nHe hurled a whole lot of sliders over the plate and located his heater as best as he could for 0/27 whiffs. The man is a Toby these days. It’s not a fun thing to see, but it’s what we’ve got.\n\nFramber Valdez (HOU) @ TEX (W) – 8.2 IP, 2 ER, 1 Hits, 3 BBs, 5 Ks – 16 Whiffs, 31% CSW, 107 pitches.\n\nYou almost had it Valdez. One out away from the no-hitter and BAM! Seager hits a two-run shot. THAT DANG SLIDER, NICK. Yeah. Funny how that works. But seriously, we’ve seen dope Valdez for all but one inning across his last three starts now (what the h*ck was up in that first frame against the Pirates?) and the fact that he went just 21% sinkers in a near no-hitter should be a sign. Or at least a sign for Valdez to stop blindly chucking the dang thing. But he doesn’t always have his changeup and curve. This is true. Seems like you have them now, though.\n\nSonny Gray (STL) vs TBR (W) – 7.0 IP, 2 ER, 4 Hits, 1 BBs, 6 Ks – 13 Whiffs, 31% CSW, 106 pitches.\n\nAtta boy Sonny. Thanks for doing your part against the Rays as you should. Can you please carry that breaking ball command with you all the time? That would be sweller than my iPhone battery in the Texas heat.\n\nChris Bassitt (TOR) vs BAL (W) – 7.0 IP, 2 ER, 3 Hits, 2 BBs, 9 Ks – 13 Whiffs, 32% CSW, 100 pitches.\n\nHe was flirting with a no-hitter and eventually settled for a stud performance through seven. I was cautious of this outing and I’m thrilled to have Bassitt prove me wrong across eight different pitches. As long as the sinker cooks (45% CSW, 13/38 called strikes), everything works out.\n\nShota Imanaga (CHC) vs MIN (W) – 7.0 IP, 2 ER, 2 Hits, 1 BBs, 10 Ks – 19 Whiffs, 29% CSW, 92 pitches.\n\nAces gonna ace and earn a Gallows Pole. He displayed gorgeous pitch separation between the four-seamer and splitter, with the latter returning a whopping 12/33 whiffs. It’s so nice to have elite IM AN AGA back for a game.\n\nNick Lodolo (CIN) @ MIA (W) – 6.0 IP, 2 ER, 2 Hits, 3 BBs, 7 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 24% CSW, 99 pitches.\n\nI dunno what to make of this man, but I’m happy this one worked well. Good fastballs along the edges (gloveside more than usual and I dig it…but don’t expect it) with decent breakers and a proper dose of changeups. Not the most overpowering game, but enough to make us give it a whirl against the Brewers.\n\nLuis Castillo (SEA) vs DET (L) – 6.0 IP, 3 ER, 8 Hits, 0 BBs, 9 Ks – 13 Whiffs, 31% CSW, 99 pitches.\n\nAces gonna Dusty Donut with nine strikeouts but a near VPQS. This was legit command from Castillo, though, and he clearly got Singled Out. I’m not worried. Still.\n\nBrayan Bello (BOS) @ KCR (ND) – 4.2 IP, 3 ER, 5 Hits, 3 BBs, 6 Ks – 13 Whiffs, 27% CSW, 89 pitches.\n\nThis was a game of sinkers not doing their part + a few changeups getting crushed as they floated into the zone. It’s good to see the slider return a 42% CSW and 7/36 whiffs, though, leaving me still confident that Bello will get it together. This is a better version of Bello than all of last year.\n\nKyle Freeland (COL) vs NYM (ND) – 4.2 IP, 3 ER, 4 Hits, 2 BBs, 7 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 32% CSW, 73 pitches.\n\n9/24 whiffs on the curveball is pretty fun, but the rest? Meh. Those were the pitches that set Freeland up for the out-of-zone hook, and I need something better if I’m chasing a Colorado pitcher in any fashion.\n\nRoss Stripling (OAK) vs CHW (L) – 5.1 IP, 4 ER, 5 Hits, 1 BBs, 2 Ks – 2 Whiffs, 29% CSW, 79 pitches.\n\nEven against the CrySox, y’all. A rolling team carries no Ross.\n\nSeth Lugo (KCR) vs BOS (L) – 5.1 IP, 4 ER, 6 Hits, 4 BBs, 4 Ks – 8 Whiffs, 20% CSW, 101 pitches.\n\nBlegh. He was wild both under the zone and armside and it wasn’t his day. Go get ’em next time, kiddo. He deserves the lack of lecture after such a long string of success.\n\nJeffrey Springs (TBR) @ STL (L) – 5.0 IP, 4 ER, 6 Hits, 3 BBs, 3 Ks – 10 Whiffs, 25% CSW, 87 pitches.\n\nHis heater was a touch better, but still not a good offering at all, while the slider and changeup were fine. We need more than that if we’re going to trust Springs as anything more than a Toby (especially from the slow ball) and he’s a clear avoid against the Orioles next. I’m not considering Spring a must-hold right now. He’s looking awfully mediocre.\n\nMacKenzie Gore (WSN) vs SFG (W) – 5.0 IP, 4 ER, 8 Hits, 2 BBs, 6 Ks – 15 Whiffs, 28% CSW, 98 pitches.\n\nIt’s a Win only because of the BirdSwanSong. Gore is a still a little down in velocity (95/96) and returned just 2/35 whiffs on non-fastballs. Dang, that heater still misses bats?! Yep. He really needs to figure out those secondaries so he doesn’t have to throw so many heaters over the plate – for all those whiffs, five hits are far too many.\n\nLuis Severino (NYM) @ COL (L) – 5.0 IP, 4 ER, 8 Hits, 0 BBs, 5 Ks – 6 Whiffs, 21% CSW, 89 pitches.\n\nWe’re back up to 97 mph on the heater (yay!) but just 17 total non-fastballs without a single whiff (nay!). Coors is undefeated. I’m looking forward to his date with the Mariners. Should be a lot better.\n\nPablo López (MIN) @ CHC (L) – 5.0 IP, 4 ER, 7 Hits, 1 BBs, 2 Ks – 7 Whiffs, 22% CSW, 88 pitches.\n\nNooooooo. He lost the sweeper again. 6/15 strikes on the pitch (zero whiffs) and that’s your ballgame. Blegh. All we can do is hope he finds it before his next start against the Royals.\n\nMax Meyer (MIA) vs CIN (L) – 4.0 IP, 6 ER, 8 Hits, 3 BBs, 2 Ks – 6 Whiffs, 20% CSW, 76 pitches.\n\nIt’s just a good slider and nothing else. If he doesn’t have a complement, the slider can’t do it. No, it’s not the four-seamer, y’all. Why put up with Meyer when the Win chance is also as low as it is? There has to be something better waiting for you on the wire.\n\nBryce Elder (ATL) vs MIL (L) – 3.2 IP, 7 ER, 8 Hits, 2 BBs, 6 Ks – 11 Whiffs, 28% CSW, 85 pitches.\n\nAdames swatted a pair of two-run shots off Elder and it just wasn’t meant to be. I don’t actually think Elder pitched that poorly, but Atlanta sure felt so, sending him back down to the minors shortly after the game ended. Bummer. At least Grant Holmes gets another shot if ReyLó isn’t ready to return…in Coors. Sigh.\n\nHayden Birdsong (SFG) @ WSN (L) – 2.0 IP, 7 ER, 5 Hits, 3 BBs, 1 Ks – 2 Whiffs, 24% CSW, 66 pitches.\n\nBirdsong leaned into the curve for the third straight game (as he should!), but the four-seamer was still terrible, while the slider wasn’t there to support him either. Oh, and CJ Abrams destroying a fastballstupid far out of the zone didn’t help things, either. At the end of the day, that fastball is awfully hittable and the curve isn’t the savior pitch. He needs the slider, too. He’s a clear-cut Cherry Bomb, even for his start against the Tigers up next. Is it worth it to chase the strikeouts? Your call. I’m personally avoiding him.\n\nGame of the Day\n\nBlake Snell vs. Jake Irvin – It’s #HotSnellSummer and I’m curious whether Irvin can keep up his stellar campaign, too.\n\nBut Nick?! Where are the streaming picks? – I’ve moved them to the daily SP Matchups & Streamer Rankings article.\n\nHave Questions? – Join my morning Playback.tv livestream! I answer all questions there for free: 10:00 am – 12:00 pm ET Monday through Friday.\n\nFeatured image by Justin Paradis (@JustParaDesigns on Twitter)"
