        "text": "LOS ANGELES (December 10)—Hackman Capital Partners, a privately-held real estate investment and operating company, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to purchase, through an affiliated entity, the iconic CBS Television City® property and sound-stage operations in Los Angeles, California. The acquisition includes the ongoing studio business, equipment and the rights to use the Television City trademark in connection with its operations on the property.\n\nTelevision City is a fully operational studio and broadcast facility comprised of approximately 780,000 square feet of stage, office, broadcasting and support space on a contiguous 25-acre campus. The investment represents a generational opportunity to acquire and operate a renowned studio on one of the largest prime infill properties in Los Angeles.\n\nHackman Capital Partners will assume operational control of the studio property, including the direct oversight of Television City’s existing studio administrative and operational staff. CBS programs, including The Late Late Show with James Corden, The Price Is Right, The Young and The Restless and The Bold And The Beautiful, will continue to be produced on the Television City campus, as well as CBS Studios International’s U.S. headquarters and other company departments currently housed on the site.\n\n“The acquisition of the legendary Television City will add another crown jewel to our portfolio,” said Michael Hackman, founder and CEO of Hackman Capital Partners. “We have had great success modernizing and transforming real estate into state-of-the art facilities for notable media, entertainment, technology and content creation companies. With a tremendous operations team already in place, we envision an exciting future for this storied production studio.”\n\n“The sale of Television City unlocks significant value, increasing CBS’s financial flexibility, including the ability to redeploy capital for strategic growth initiatives such as additional content investment,” said Joseph Ianniello, President and Acting CEO, CBS Corporation. “At the same time, we will be transitioning this venerable site to a new owner who is committed to its legacy as both a cultural landmark and modern production facility. Hackman Capital has demonstrated terrific stewardship of classic properties, including their development of the landmark Culver Studios.”\n\nHackman Capital Partners acquired The Culver Studios, through an affiliate, in 2014 and is currently implementing Phase 2 of its Innovation Plan, a state-of-the-art transformation that will modernize the 100-year old studio as a next-generation campus for Amazon Studios and its related content affiliates.\n\n“Television City was built in 1952 and literally put television production on the map in Los Angeles,” Michael Hackman said. “We are looking forward to building upon this venerable legacy to continue Los Angeles’ leadership in entertainment and technology.”\n\nMORE ABOUT CBS CORPORATION\n\nCBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) is a mass media company that creates and distributes industry-leading content across a variety of platforms to audiences around the world.
