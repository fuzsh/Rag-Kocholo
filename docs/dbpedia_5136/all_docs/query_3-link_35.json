Both pricing tiers come with a seven-day free trial.\n\nSling TV is the most cost-effective way to stream network-aired NFL games\n\nIf you don't have cable TV that includes NBC, Fox, ABC, ESPN and NFL Network, one of the most cost-effective ways to watch preseason football, and all the major sporting events happening this fall, is through a subscription to Sling TV. We suggest leveling up your coverage to the Orange + Blue with Sports Extra tier to get more NFL and college football games this fall.\n\nThe Orange + Blue plan regularly costs $60 per month, but the streamer currently offers a $25 off promotion for your first month, so you'll pay just $35. The Orange + Blue with Sports Extra plan is $50 for your first month and $75 per month after. The Sports Extra add-on features 18 channels, including NFL Redzone, ESPNU, SEC Network, Big 10 Network and ACC Network.\n\nThe streamer is also currently offering big savings on four months of the Orange + Blue tier plus the Sports Extra plan when you prepay for the Sling TV Season Pass. The plan costs $219, reduced from $300.\n\nNote: Because Sling TV does not carry CBS, Sling subscribers will want to add Paramount+ to their bundle. (Paramount+ and CBS Essentials are both subsidiaries of Paramount Global.)\n\nTop features of Sling TV Orange + Blue plan:\n\nSling TV is our top choice for streaming major sporting events like NASCAR.\n\nThere are 52 channels to watch in total, including local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available).\n\nYou get access to most local NFL games and nationally broadcast games at the lowest price.\n\nAll subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.\n\nYou can add Golf Channel, NBA TV, NHL Network, NFL RedZone, MLB Network, Tennis Channel and more sports-oriented channels (18 in total) via Sling TV's Sports Extras add-on. It's a great pick for pro and college football fans.\n\nWatch every network-aired NFL game with FuboTV\n\nYou can watch every NFL game airing on network TV on FuboTV. FuboTV is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to almost every NFL game of the season.
