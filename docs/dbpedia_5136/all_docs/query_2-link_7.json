        "text": "Who owns the Yankees Organization? The New York Yankees are primarily owned by the Steinbrenner family, through their company Yankee Global Enterprises. The family’s involvement began in 1973 when George Steinbrenner, an American businessman, led a group of investors to purchase the team from CBS.\n\nAfter George’s death in 2010, the ownership passed on to his children, including Hal and Hank Steinbrenner. Hal Steinbrenner currently serves as the managing general partner and co-chairperson, making him the principal owner responsible for the day-to-day operations of the team.\n\nCompany History\n\nThe New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in New York City. Founded in 1901, the team has had multiple ownership changes throughout its history. Here’s a brief overview of the history and ownership changes of the club:1. 1901 – The team was established as the Baltimore Orioles, founded by Ban Johnson, president of the Western League, later turned American League.\n\nThe original team investors and owners were John Mahon and Frank Farrell, who bought the team for $18,000. 2. 1903 – The team was moved to New York City and renamed the New York Highlanders. 3. 1913 – The name was officially changed to the New York Yankees. 4.\n\n1915 – New York businessman Jacob Ruppert and military engineer Tillinghast L’Hommedieu Huston purchased the team for $1.25 million. 5. 1939 – Following the death of Huston, Ruppert bought his partner’s share, becoming the sole owner of the team. 6. 1947 – After Ruppert’s death, his estate sold 90% of the club to industry executives George Weiss, Larry MacPhail, and Dan Topping for $2.8 million.\n\nMacPhail later sold his share to Weiss and Topping, who became the majority owners of the team. 7. 1964 – CBS, an American television and radio network, bought 80% of the Yankees for $11.2 million, and later purchased the remaining 20% in 1966, making them the first corporate owner of the team. 8. 1973 – George Steinbrenner led a group of investors to purchase the team from CBS for $10 million.\n\nSteinbrenner became known as “The Boss” for his hands-on ownership style and was very active in managing the team. 9. 1998 – YankeeNets, a holding company that merged the business operations of the Yankees and the New Jersey Nets, was formed. The Yankees contributed $190 million and a controlling interest in the new venture, while the Nets contributed $90 million. 10. 2004 – YankeeNets was dissolved, and the Yankees’ ownership stake was transferred to a separate company called Yankee Global Enterprises LLC. Steinbrenner maintained his role as the principal owner of the Yankees.\n\n11. 2010 – George Steinbrenner passed away, and the team ownership was passed on to his sons, Hank and Hal Steinbrenner. Hal took on the role of managing general partner.\n\nAs of now, the New York Yankees are owned by Yankee Global Enterprises, with Hal Steinbrenner as the controlling owner. The Steinbrenner family continues to maintain a significant stake in the team’s ownership.\n\nWho was the original founder?\n\nThe New York Yankees were originally founded as the Baltimore Orioles in 1901 but were renamed the New York Highlanders in 1903 when they moved to New York City. They became known as the Yankees in 1913. The team was purchased by Frank J. Farrell and Bill Devery, who are considered the original founders of the Yankees organization. Frank J.\n\nFarrell was born in 1866 in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. He started his career working as a poolroom operator, eventually branching into legal and illegal gambling establishments.\n\nFarrell became involved in politics, serving as the Tammany Hall leader for Manhattan’s West Side, which allowed him to gain connections and build relationships within the political and business communities. Bill Devery was born in 1854 in New York City. He started out as a police officer in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming Chief of Police.\n\nHowever, Devery generated controversy with his heavy-handed policing methods and allegations of corruption. He was eventually dismissed from the NYPD due to those claims. Combining their resources, Farrell and Devery purchased the Baltimore Orioles for $18,000 and moved the team to New York in 1903.\n\nTheir fortunes changed when in 1915, they sold the team to a group of investors led by Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L’Hommedieu Huston for $460,000. Under Ruppert and Huston ownership, the Yankees began to build a stellar reputation and legacy, signing legendary players like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio over the years.\n\nToday, the team is owned by the Steinbrenner family, who have maintained the successful and well-recognized brand that the Yankees have become.\n\nFAQ: Who Owns the Yankees?\n\n1.
