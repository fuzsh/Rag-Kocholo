The Bank offers the entire spectrum of financial services to customer segments covering Large and Mid-Corporates, MSME, Agriculture and Retail Businesses.\n\nAxis Bank is one of the first new generation private sector banks to have begun operations in 1994.

(NIC), The New India Assurance Company Ltd. (NIA), The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. (OIC), and United India Insurance Company Ltd. (UIIC).

In a first, the 'One-View' feature on the Bank’s mobile app allows customers to manage their finances seamlessly across various banks.\n\nAs a pioneer in embracing numerous innovative technological advancements, Axis was the first Bank to go live with UPI interoperability on its CBDC App. It became the first bank to introduce digital US dollar fixed deposit (FD) for NRI customers at the IFSC Banking Unit in GIFT City, Gujarat. The Bank also launched a first-of-its-kind comprehensive digital proposition \"NEO for Business\" to cater to the new-age banking needs of MSMEs. In partnership with the RBI Innovation Hub, the Bank now provides access to super-fast digital KCC and MSME loans. Axis Bank has taken significant strides in the adoption of Gen AI by rolling out Microsoft Copilot across select user base, and a GenAI-based chatbot for ~60,000 users across branches, for enhanced customer service efficiency and personalized banking experiences.\n\nThe Bank added 125 branches during the quarter and 475 overall in the FY24 period, taking its overall distribution network to 5,377 domestic branches and extension counters situated across 2,963 centres compared to 4,903 domestic branches and extension counters situated in 2,741 centres as on 31st March 2023. As on 31st March 2024, the Bank had 16,026 ATMs and cash recyclers spread across the country. The Bank’s Axis Virtual Centre is present across six centres with over ~1,590 Virtual Relationship Managers as on 31st March 2024. The Bank has been steadily gaining market share in the rural and semi urban markets through its 2,482 Bharat Bank branches, complemented by a 64,600+ strong CSC VLE network.\n\nThe Overseas operations of the Bank are spread over eight international offices with branches in Singapore, Dubai (at DIFC), and Gift City-IBU; representative offices in Dhaka, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and an overseas subsidiary in London, UK. The international offices focus on Corporate Lending, Coverage Business, Trade Finance, Syndication, Investment Banking, Liability Businesses, and Private Banking/Wealth Management offerings.\n\nWith a balance sheet size of Rs. 14,77,209 crores as on 31st March 2024, Axis Bank has achieved consistent growth and with a 5-year CAGR (2018-19 to 2023-24) of 13% in Total Assets & 15% each in Advances and Deposits."
