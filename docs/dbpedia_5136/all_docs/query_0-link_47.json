        "text": "Here are today’s and tomorrow’s daily SP Streamer rankings for fantasy baseball.\n\nEvery day of the 2024 baseball season, I’ll be looking at today’s and tomorrow’s slate of scheduled starting pitchers and ranking their matchups for your fantasy baseball streams.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into this and you can hang out with me on Playback.tv/pitcherlist to talk about the specific ranks as I make them every weekday morning from 10am – 12pm ET. If you have questions about these ranks, please ask during the morning Playback AMA. Those are my office hours as I generally don’t answer comments on the site.\n\nThere are four tiers to these rankings with 12-teamers in mind:\n\nAuto-Start – Just do it. Don’t overthink this, start the man. This includes “if I have them rostered, I’m starting them” pitchers.\n\nProbably Start – I’m likely starting these arms, though I recognize there is more risk than we’d like there to be. Either it’s a tough matchup for a good-not-elite pitcher or a weak lineup for a volatile arm. These pitchers have a 50% or greater chance of performing well in my view and I’m starting them in the majority of situations.\n\nQuestionable Start – Think of this tier as “I don’t want to start these pitchers in a vacuum, but you could do worse.” Streamers found in this tier are not pitchers I’m targeting and are only if you are in dire need of one. To play it safe with streaming, just start the Probably Start streamers.\n\nDo Not Start – The reward is not worth the risk. Don’t do it. Seriously, these pitchers have a very slim chance of success or sometimes none at all.\n\nObviously, there will be circumstances where pitchers should move between teams for your situation specifically and these new tiers should act as a little more help than the straight table from last year.\n\nPlease keep in mind that streaming is far from a perfect play. In fact, if they work out over half the time, I’d consider it a success. These matchup rankings & streamer picks are going to be wildly different than the actual results throughout the year, so please, have sympathy before the scathing comments and tweets. I’m only trying to help!\n\nMake sure to read the notes if you’re wondering why I’m favoring certain pitchers over others – I won’t get to everyone and hopefully I answer what questions you will have.\n\nThere is a second table for tomorrow’s starting pitcher matchups as well, helping everyone get a jump on their nightly pickups. Please note that these matchups are subject to change, though, and there will be times when I have the incorrect pitcher going. I thank you for your future understanding.\n\nFinally, there are my streaming picks of the day, and please keep in mind that I am forced to pick a streamer every day. Those highlighted in Green are that day’s streaming pick in the second tier and I’d roll with them everywhere. Those in Yellow are in the third tier and should be okay if you’re searching for something on a given day, but I don’t recommend streaming unless you’re in need. Finally, those are Red are those I really don’t want to start (they are labeled as “Do Not Start”, after all) but have no other choice. Don’t stream these guys until you are truly desperate. A streaming pick is defined as “rostered in 20% or fewer leagues according to Fantasy Pros. This really emphasizes the point that I’d be happy if over 50% of these worked. I could do the whole sub 30/40% rostered, but there’s no fun in that. You can use the rankings to realize who those picks would be instead.\n\n(Opener) – Outlines that a pitcher is being opened for that day & the pitcher listed will follow the opener.\n\nAs I do my rankings, I thought it would be helpful to showcase a table of how we’re ranking offenses (in alphabetical order by tier):\n\nNick’s Loose Team Offense Rankings (Updated 8/6)\n\nI’m sure it’ll change through the year + there are differences to be made about teams vs. LHP or RHP, but it works as a general table that y’all should keep in mind.\n\nAlright, let’s get to it.\n\nTo spice up these streaming recommendations, I’ve included our new daily fantasy baseball projections powered by PLV, and I’ll be competing against PL Bot to pick the best streaming option each day.\n\nThese projections are different from your typical projections as they incorporate our pitch quantifier, assessing pitcher and hitter skills at a much more granular level than your standard box score.\n\nTo get access to PL Bot’s picks each day, sign up for PL Pro here.\n\nThe streaming record is determined by “Was this a productive game for 12-teamers if I started them?” Roughly a PQS with a Win and a strikeout per inning with a sub 1.20 WHIP, with a minimum of 5 IP. Close calls are decided by Playback chat.\n\nNick’s 2024 Streamer Record: 68-59\n\nMy pick yesterday: David Festa @ CHC – W\n\nPL Bot’s 2024 Streamer Record: 73-54\n\nPL Bot’s Pick yesterday: JP Sears vs. CHW W\n\nWant PL Bot’s pick today? Sign up for PL Pro here.\n\nMy streaming pick of the day is Underlined and Italicized.\n\nToday’s Starting Pitcher Rankings\n\nAuto Starts\n\nChris Sale vs. MIL – Aces gonna ace.\n\nDylan Cease @ PIT – Aces gonna ace.\n\nLuis Castillo vs. DET – Aces gonna ace.\n\nShota Imanaga vs. MIN – Aces gonna ace.\n\nSonny Gray vs. TBR – Gray looked far better in his last outing and it’s the Rays.\n\nLuis Gil vs. LAA – Gil’s slider has stepped up + the Angels, y’all.\n\nSeth Lugo vs. BOS – Lugo is that lovely rock.\n\nPablo López @ CHC – López has performed far better as of late and the Cubs aren’t so scary.\n\nGrayson Rodriguez @ TOR – Does Grayson have the command to look like an ace against Toronto?\n\nProbably Starts\n\nBrayan Bello @ KCR – Bello is on the rise with his full pitch mix working.\n\nBen Lively vs. ARI – He’s a Vargas Rule against a middling offense.\n\nNick Lodolo @ MIA – It’s the Marlins.\n\nHayden Birdsong @ WSN – Was it just the Rockies or actually something Birdsong can continue to showcase? I’m happy the Nationals are the next small step forward.\n\nFramber Valdez @ TEX – He’s a Cherry Bomb. You really don’t know what you’re gonna get.\n\nQuestionable Starts\n\nChris Bassitt vs. BAL – He’s a Toby and the Orioles are a scary offense.\n\nMacKenzie Gore vs. SFG – The lower velocity + erratic command has made Gore a Cherry Bomb and I’m so sad about it.\n\nMax Meyer vs. CIN – I dislike the four-seamer and his slider is looking like the only pitch we can trust. I’m hoping he shows something different outside of the breaker to get me excited.\n\nJeffrey Springs @ STL – It’s his second outing and I’m hoping to see more in his fastball and slider.\n\nCristopher Sánchez @ LAD – The Dodgers y’all…\n\nJonathan Cannon @ OAK – If he can spot his sinker well and go Neckbeard, he’ll make it work.\n\nKeider Montero @ SEA – Nearly our streaming pick of the day as Montero is capable of taking advantage of the Mariners. I really don’t like it, though.\n\nRoss Stripling vs. CHW – It’s the CrySox, but does Stripling have enough in the tank to seize the opportunity?\n\nUPDATE: Bryce Elder vs. MIL – Elder is throwing harder with improved stuff…? There’s a chance this works and I’m curious if this is the outing that turns heads.\n\nClayton Kershaw vs. PHI – Kershaw failed to earn a strikeout in his last start and now has to face the Phillies.\n\nBailey Falter vs. SDP – Falter has been able to churn outs with high heaters based on his extension + mixing in a breaker or two underneath.\n\nDo Not Starts\n\nColin Rea @ ATL – Rea has wild chaos magic, like a proper Werewolf.\n\nLuis Severino @ COL – It’s Coors and Severino isn’t pumping the ched we want to see.\n\nKyle Freeland vs. NYM – He’s had some moments, but it’s Coors. You can’t do this.\n\nEduardo Rodriguez @ CLE – He’s back! And clearly Still ILL in HR-heavy Cleveland.\n\nTyler Mahle vs. HOU – He’s back from TJS! And in a clear Still ILL against a strong offense.\n\nDavis Daniel @ NYY – Nah and Naaaaaah.\n\nEnjoy these rankings? Support my work and Pitcher List by getting PL+ or PL Pro!

It hurt. Expect better.\n\nJake Irvin vs. SFG – Irvin’s four-seamer has performed better than expected lately and his curveball is still ridiculously good.\n\nFreddy Peralta @ ATL – Peralta is showing signs of Professor Chaos and I sure hope he wrangles in his arsenal for the final two months. The risk/reward is still heavily in your favor to trust him here.\n\nProbably Starts\n\nKutter Crawford @ KCR – Like those lamenting over analysts of giving too much love to their favorite teams, The Homers Are Ruining Everything. At least this one isn’t in Fenway and spacious Kansas City and I have to believe the longball rates will regress appropriately.\n\nYusei Kikuchi @ TEX – Kikuchi made a statement in his first start with the Astros, shelving the curve and whipping out a legit changeup for once. I’m massively in favor of a big second half from Kikuchi, though I understand if you’re hesitant to trust Kikuchi against the Rangers.\n\nNestor Cortes vs. LAA – Cortes has been granted a lovely gift of the Angels, making this Toby click his heels in the air.\n\nAndrew Abbott @ MIA – It’s the Marlins. You said that so many times last week AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. Fine. It’s Andrew and despite being a Cherry Bomb, he’s worked out far more than not.\n\nErick Fedde vs. TBR – Fedde has been Spider-Man material all year and now gets the Rays.\n\nQuestionable Starts\n\nJoey Estes vs. CHW – I’m not thrilled to label Estes as my streaming pick of the day, but it’s the CrySox y’all.\n\nGavin Stone vs. PHI – Stone needs to be sanded around the edges and has to endure the mighty Phillies. Yikes.\n\nJavier Assad vs. MIN – The early season version of Assad is unlikely to return, but his secondaries are faring well enough to make a case for a productive night for your ratios.\n\nBrandon Pfaadt @ CLE – I don’t trust Pfaadt and this is in Cleveland.\n\nDo Not Starts\n\nValente Bellozo vs. CIN – You might see a lot more of Bellozo down the stretch with the depleted Marlins rotation and here’s a decent matchup against the Reds. Yes, this is super boring.\n\nTrevor Rogers @ TOR – Who knows, maybe this is the start that Rogers feels the impact of his new Orioles club and displays his proper value. Probably not.\n\nPaul Blackburn @ COL – It’s Coors. Naaaah.\n\nMarco Gonzales vs. SDP – Gonzo has a touch of Toby in him, but the Padres are legit.\n\nTyler Phillips @ LAD – I think people learned their lesson about Phillips in his last outing and now has to endure the full force of the Dodgers offense.\n\nCarlos Carrasco vs. ARI – At least Carrasco has a long leash.\n\nCarson Fulmer @ NYY – It’s the Yankees. Fortunately, Fulmer is secondary-focused and could squirm around Judge and Soto.\n\nBowden Francis vs. BAL – Francis has showed some promise as of late, but this is Baltimore away from the safety of Waltimore.\n\nDavis Martin @ OAK – Not to be confused with Daniel, Martin goes against the Athletics and has the poor CrySox offense behind him. He could go Dancing With The Disco but I have many doubts here. Oakland isn’t such a bad offense, y’all.\n\nRyan Feltner vs. NYM – In Coors? Not a chance.\n\nJose Urena vs. HOU – Who knows, maybe that changeup has a touch of magic left…?\n\nEnjoy these rankings? Support my work and Pitcher List by getting PL+ or PL Pro!
