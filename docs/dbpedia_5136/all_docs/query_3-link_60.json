        "text": "Aug. 6—Stocks and earnings for the parent company of New Mexico's largest electricity provider are looking up.\n\nTXNM, formerly PNM Resources, beat estimates for its second quarter, according to the company's most recent results report.\n\nTXNM analyst Lisa Goodman said earnings per share were at 60 cents in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 55 cents in the second quarter 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, Goodman said the 2024 EPS guidance range remains at $2.65 to $2.75. She said the company will revisit those figures in the third quarter, since that quarter typically accounts for the largest portion of the company's earnings.\n\n\"We are ahead of expectations in the first half of the year,\" she said.\n\nTXNM projects a 10% rate base growth from 2024 to 2028, Goodman said, not including a $150 million capital investment for the company's Texas utility's system resiliency plan.\n\nThe company also just completed its name change from PNM Resources to TXNM Energy. The change went into effect late Friday and, as of Monday, stocks are listed under the ticker \"TXNM\" rather than \"PNM.\" The CUSIP number is still 69349H107.\n\nThere aren't any structural or organizational changes to the company under the new name, according to TXNM.\n\nThe stock stood at $40.24 when trading closed Monday with an unsurprising drop of 3.66%, declining along with the rest of the global market. By closing on Tuesday, the stocks were down 0.12% at $40.19.\n\nThe TXNM stock has been climbing over the past months. In both the past month and past six months altogether, it rose about 11%.\n\nIt's a gradual recovery from the nearly 10% drop the stock experienced over the past year.\n\nThe company is still trying to recover from a major dip at the start of 2024. Shortly after PNM Resources' planned merger with Avangrid, a subsidiary of energy giant Iberdrola, fell through, stocks dropped more than 7% in January alone.\n\nIn March, then-PNM Resources President and COO Don Tarry said the company raises capital by selling shares of stock and he had been traveling to talk about the benefits of the stock with potential shareholders.\n\nCompany Chair and CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said in a statement in late July, following the second quarter results, that TXNM plans to invest and advance in grid infrastructure.\n\nThat includes the grid modernization plan filed by PNM in late 2022 with the state's Public Regulation Commission.\n\nIt's a six-year, $344 million plan to help modernize an aging electric grid to increase reliability and add more renewable energy. The PRC held hearings on the plan in April, and the company expects a decision late summer or early fall, according to TXNM.\n\n\"As we move forward under the TXNM Energy name, we remain committed to providing reliable energy to our customers and communities across New Mexico and Texas,\" Vincent-Collawn said."
