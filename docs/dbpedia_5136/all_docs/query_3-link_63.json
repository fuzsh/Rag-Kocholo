CBS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), has awarded the Participant Stock Options (the Stock Options) under the [ ] Plan, as amended from time to time (the Plan). The Stock Options have been awarded to the Participant subject to the terms and conditions contained in (A) the certificate for the grant of Stock Options attached hereto (the Stock Option Certificate), (B) the terms and conditions contained herein (the Stock Option Certificate and the terms and conditions, collectively, the Certificate) and (C) the Plan, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference (the items listed in (A), (B) and (C), collectively, the Terms and Conditions). A copy of the Plan has been or will be made available to the Participant on-line at Morgan Stanley Smith Barneys website.\n\nCapitalized terms that are not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Stock Option Certificate or the Plan. The Stock Options are not intended to be, or to qualify as, Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.\n\nSection 1.2 Terms of Stock Options.\n\n(a) Vesting. The Stock Options shall be exercisable only to the extent the Participant is vested therein. The Stock Options shall vest in four equal installments on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the Date of Grant, except that any fractional Stock Options resulting from the application of the foregoing vesting schedule will be aggregated and will vest on whichever of the preceding vesting dates shall be determined by the Company in accordance with its customary procedures; provided, that if the Participants employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates due to the Participants death or Permanent Disability before any Stock Options have vested, such unvested Stock Options shall immediately vest and become exercisable effective as of the date of the Participants termination of employment due to death or Permanent Disability.\n\n(b) Option Period. Except as provided in Section 1.2(c) hereof, the period during which the Stock Options may be exercised shall expire on the eighth anniversary of the Date of Grant (the Expiration Date). If the Participant remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through the Expiration Date, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on\n\n1\n\nwhich the Class B Common Stock is then listed. The Participant must act within a reasonable amount of time to execute and complete the trade prior to the close of trading on the Expiration Date of the grant. If the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.\n\n(c) Exercise in the Event of a Termination of Employment, Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death:\n\n(i) Termination other than for Cause, or due to Retirement, Permanent Disability or Death.\n\n(x) If, at the time of his or her termination of employment, the Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries that contains provisions different from those set forth in Section 1.2(c)(i)(y) below, then such different provisions will control so long as they are in effect and applicable to the Participant at the time of his or her termination of employment.\n\n(y) Otherwise, in the event of the Participants termination of employment (other than a Termination for Cause) or due to the Participants Retirement, Permanent Disability or death, the Participants Outstanding Stock Options can be exercised in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n(A) if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the voluntary termination by the Participant or the termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than a Termination for Cause, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent then exercisable for a period of six months after the date of such termination, but in no event later than the Expiration Date;\n\n(B) if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the Participants Retirement, the Participant may exercise his or her Outstanding Stock Options to the extent exercisable on the date of Retirement until the Expiration Date;\n\n(C) if the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the Participants Permanent Disability, his or her Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable on the date of the Participants termination of employment due to Permanent\n\n2\n\nDisability until the third anniversary of such date, but in no event later than the Expiration Date; and\n\n(D) if a Participant dies, the Participants Outstanding Stock Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable at the date of death by (i) the Participants beneficiary, if the Company has adopted procedures whereby Participants may designate a beneficiary and the Participant has done so, or (ii) if the Company has not adopted such procedures or the Participant has not designated a beneficiary, by the person or persons who acquired the right to exercise such Outstanding Stock Options by will or the laws of descent and distribution, in either case for a period of two years after the date of death, but in no event later than the Expiration Date.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Section 1.2 or as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon the occurrence of an event described in clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this Section 1.2(c)(i)(y), all rights with respect to Stock Options that are not vested as of such event will be relinquished. A termination of employment occurs, for purposes of the Stock Options, when a Participant is no longer an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the employment of a Participant who works for a Subsidiary shall terminate, for purposes of the Stock Options, on the date on which the Participants employing company ceases to be a Subsidiary.\n\n(ii) Termination for Cause. If the Participants employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ends due to a Termination for Cause then, unless the Committee in its discretion determines otherwise, all Outstanding Stock Options, whether or not then vested, shall terminate effective as of the date of such termination.\n\n(iii) Exercise Periods following Termination of Employment. For the purposes of determining the dates on which Stock Options may be exercised following a termination of employment (including as a result of Permanent Disability, Retirement or death), the day following the date of termination of employment shall be the first day of the exercise period and the Stock Options may be exercised until the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed. Thus, if the last day of the exercise period is not a trading day, then the last date the Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the end of the exercise period.\n\n3\n\nSection 1.3 Exercise of Stock Options.\n\n(a) Whole or Partial Exercise. The Participant may exercise all vested Outstanding Stock Options granted hereunder in whole at one time or in part in increments of 100 Stock Options (or in the entire number of Outstanding Stock Options in which the Participant is vested, if such number is less than 100) by notice to the Director, Global Stock Plans, CBS Corporation, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, or to such agent(s) for the Company (Agent) as the Company may from time to time specify, in such manner and at such address as may be specified from time to time by the Company. Such notice shall (i) state the number of whole Stock Options being exercised, and (ii) be signed (or otherwise authorized in a manner acceptable to the Company) by the person or persons so exercising the Stock Options and, in the event the Stock Options are being exercised (pursuant to Section 1.2(c) hereof) by any person or persons other than the Participant accompanied by proof satisfactory to the Companys counsel of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Stock Options. Information concerning any Agent and its address may be obtained by contacting the Director, Global Stock Plans.\n\n(b) Payment of Aggregate Option Price. Full payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (which shall be determined by multiplying the number of Stock Options being exercised by the Exercise Price as set forth on the Stock Option Certificate) shall be made on or before the settlement date for the shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Options. In accordance with the rules and procedures established by the Committee for this purpose, the Stock Options may be exercised through a cashless exercise procedure, approved by the Committee, involving a broker or dealer, that affords the Participant the opportunity to sell immediately some or all of the shares underlying the exercised portion of the Stock Options in order to generate sufficient cash to pay the Exercise Price of the Stock Options. In addition, if the Company so permits, the Exercise Price may be paid in whole or in part using a net share settlement procedure or through the withholding of shares subject to the Stock Options with a value equal to the Exercise Price. In accordance with Section 4.3 hereof, the Participant shall make an arrangement acceptable to the Company to pay to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the combined federal, state, local or other withholding tax obligations which arise in connection with the exercise of such Stock Options.\n\n(c) Issuance of Shares. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 1.3(b) hereof, the Company shall electronically transfer to the broker in the name of the Participant the amount of shares of Class B Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Stock Options.\n\n(d) Outstanding Stock Options. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock subject to the Stock Options that is set forth on the Stock Option Certificate may not reflect the number of Outstanding Stock Options due to Stock Option exercises or adjustments pursuant to Article II.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nEFFECT OF CERTAIN CORPORATE CHANGES\n\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation, stock split, reverse stock split, dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification, reorganization, split-up, spin-off or recapitalization\n\n4\n\nthat changes the character or amount of the Class B Common Stock or any other changes in the corporate structure, equity securities or capital structure of the Company, the Committee shall make such adjustments, if any, to the number of shares and kind of securities subject to the Stock Options, and the Exercise Price of the Stock Options, in each case, as it deems appropriate. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, also make such other adjustments as it deems appropriate in order to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available hereunder. Such determinations by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nAs used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(a) Board shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\n(b) Certificate shall mean the Stock Option Certificate, together with the terms and conditions contained herein.\n\n(c) Class B Common Stock shall mean shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company.\n\n(d) Code shall mean the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended, including any successor law thereto and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n(e) Committee shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board (or such other Committee(s) as may be appointed or designated by the Board to administer the Plan).\n\n(f) Date of Grant shall be the date set forth on the Stock Option Certificate.\n\n(g) Expiration Date shall be the date set forth on the Stock Option Certificate and in Section 1.2(b) hereof.\n\n(h) Exercise Price shall be the amount set forth on the Stock Option Certificate, which amount shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Class B Common Stock on the Date of Grant.\n\n(i) Fair Market Value of a share of Class B Common Stock on a given date shall be the 4:00 p.m. (New York time) closing price on such date on the New York Stock Exchange or other principal stock exchange on which the Class B Common Stock is then listed, as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition) or as reported by any other authoritative source selected by the Company.\n\n(j) Outstanding Stock Option shall mean a Stock Option granted to the Participant which has not yet been exercised and which has not yet expired or been terminated in accordance with its terms.\n\n(k) Participant shall mean the employee named on the Stock Option Certificate.\n\n5\n\n(l) Permanent Disability shall have the same meaning as such term or a similar term has in the long-term disability policy maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof for the Participant and that is in effect on the date of the onset of the Participants Permanent Disability, unless the Committee determines otherwise.\n\n(m) Retirement shall, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, mean the termination (other than by reason of death or for a Termination for Cause) of a Participants employment with the Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries once the Participant is at least 55 years of age and has completed at least ten years of service (as determined pursuant to the Companys applicable practices) with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries.\n\n(n) Section 409A shall mean Section 409A of the Code and the rules, regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder from time to time.\n\n(o) Stock Option shall mean the contractual right granted to the Participant to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock at such time and price, subject to such other Terms and Conditions.\n\n(p) Stock Option Certificate shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1.1 hereof.\n\n(q) Subsidiary shall mean a corporation or other entity with respect to which the Company owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding shares of stock normally entitled to vote for the election of directors (or comparable voting power), provided that the Committee may also designate any other corporation or other entity in which the Company, directly or indirectly, has an equity or similar interest corresponding to 50% or less of such voting power as a Subsidiary for purposes of the Plan.\n\n(r) Termination for Cause shall mean a termination of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of (i) cause, as such term or a similar term is defined in any employment agreement that is in effect and applicable to the Participant, or (ii) if there is no such employment agreement in effect or if such employment agreement contains no such term, the Participants: (A) commission of any dishonest or fraudulent act that has caused or may reasonably be expected to cause injury to the interest or business reputation of the Company or any of it Subsidiaries;
