        "text": "Agreement between User and SeatGeek\n\nPlease read this Terms of Use agreement (the “Terms of Use\" or “Terms”) carefully. These Terms of Use govern the use of seatgeek.com, or the mobile applications “SeatGeek” (the “Digital Properties”) of SeatGeek, Inc. (“SeatGeek”), and apply to all users visiting the Digital Properties, including using the services and resources available or enabled via the Digital Properties (each a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”). By clicking on the “I Accept”, “Place Order” or “Sign Up” button, completing the registration process, making a purchase, listing a ticket for sale, and/or browsing the website or downloading SeatGeek’s mobile application (the “Application”), YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A BINDING CONTRACT, and you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with SeatGeek, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the Terms of Use personally or on behalf of company you have named as the user, and to bind that company to these Terms of Use. The term “you” refers to the individual or company, as applicable, identified as the user when you registered with a Digital Property. If you do not agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, you may not access or use any Digital Property or the Services.\n\nPlease be aware that Section 14 of these Terms of Use, below, contains provisions governing how claims are resolved that you and we have against each other, including, without limitation, any claims that arose or were asserted prior to the effective date of these Terms of Use. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND SEATGEEK WILL BE RESOLVED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR BY JURY TRIAL.\n\nYour use of, and participation in, certain Services may be subject to additional terms (“Supplemental Terms”) and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in the Terms of Use or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental Service. If the Terms of Use are inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to such Service. The Terms of Use and any applicable Supplemental Terms are referred to herein as the “Terms.”\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY SEATGEEK IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME. If you do not agree to any change(s), you shall stop using the Digital Properties and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the Digital Properties and/or Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.\n\nSeatGeek Marketplace.\n\nSeatGeek Ticket Marketplace. SeatGeek offers an online secondary marketplace that allows Users (as defined below) to buy (each, a “Buyer”) and sell (each, a “Seller”) tickets and other related items to events (each or together (as the context may require), a “Ticket”). As such, our marketplace Services are merely designed to act as a marketplace to connect Buyers and Sellers, and for transactions listed or taking place via SeatGeek’s ticket marketplace, SeatGeek makes no guarantee with respect (a) to the existence, quality, safety or legality of the Tickets, (b) the truth or accuracy of a Seller’s listings or content, (c) the ability of Sellers to sell Tickets or the ability of Buyers to pay for them, or (d) that a Seller or Buyer will complete any transaction.\n\nNo Endorsement. Unless otherwise expressly stated by SeatGeek, the display of any Tickets or Sellers on our Digital Properties does not in any way imply, suggest or constitute an endorsement by us of those Tickets or that Seller, or any sponsorship of us by such Seller, or any other affiliation between such Seller and us.\n\nTickets. The ticket price (the “Ticket Price”) for resale Tickets may be set at, above or below, the original price of the Ticket. Unless otherwise noted on a Ticket, on the listing or on a confirmation page or email, Tickets may be transferable, even if another person’s name appears on the face of the Ticket. Sellers are obligated to deliver the Tickets to you prior to the event, and you will be protected by the Buyer Guarantee if a Seller fails to provide you the Tickets prior to an event. All prices for Tickets are in United States dollars unless noted otherwise.\n\nBuying Tickets. Buyers are solely responsible for completing their transactions in their purchase of Tickets, including the payment of applicable fees. By committing to purchase a Ticket, you are entering into a binding contract with the Seller to purchase the applicable Ticket. All sales are final, and except for canceled events, you will not receive a refund for any completed purchase. You cannot change or cancel orders after the sale is complete.\n\nAgreement. You agree to supply Seller and SeatGeek with the appropriate information necessary for delivery of tickets, including, but not limited to, email address and physical address (if applicable). If you provide incorrect information for the delivery of Tickets, or you are unavailable to receive the tickets when they are delivered, you will not be eligible for a refund or Buyer Guarantee (referenced below).\n\nNumber of Tickets or “Ticket Limits”. In an effort to give all interested customers an opportunity to purchase Tickets to an event or other items via the Service and to discourage unfair Ticket buying practices, our clients often set limits on the number of seating and/or parking rights, or tickets a single customer may purchase. You will be advised of any such limits during the purchase process, or by a system limitation on the number of Tickets you may purchase during your online session. Tickets purchased for an event during multiple online sessions via the Service may be totaled to ensure that any limitations imposed by the SeatGeek client is not exceeded. Each SeatGeek account must be linked to a unique individual, and must contain valid and verifiable information. Multiple accounts may not be used to circumvent or exceed published ticket limits. If you exceed or attempt to exceed the posted ticket limits for a particular event, SeatGeek may cancel, without notice, any or all Ticket purchase transactions made by you for such event and return the Tickets to our client, in addition to prohibiting your Ticket purchasing abilities for the event.\n\nUse of Ticket Bot Technology. You may not attempt to conceal your identity by using multiple Internet Protocol addresses or email addresses, or by any other means, to conduct Ticket transactions on the SeatGeek online marketplace. You may not use ticket bot technology to search for, reserve, or purchase Tickets through the SeatGeek online marketplace. For the avoidance of doubt, this specifically prohibits you from using automated ticket purchasing software on the SeatGeek online marketplace, and prohibits you from circumventing any security measure, access control system, or other technological control or measure on the SeatGeek online marketplace that is used to enforce posted event Ticket purchasing limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online Ticket purchasing order rules.\n\nOriginal Ticket Price. We may provide the original ticket price for a Ticket being sold on our Digital Properties prior to purchase, in accordance with applicable law. As a Buyer, you should understand that (i) we can only provide the original price if we have access to the information, either from our own records as the primary ticketing service provider for the last sale or from the Seller themselves, and (ii) in the event we receive this information from the Seller, we do not independently verify the truthfulness or accuracy of such information.\n\nBuyer Guarantee. We want Buyers to be able to buy Tickets with confidence. Accordingly, each qualified order is covered by SeatGeek’s Buyer Guarantee found here.\n\nSelling Tickets. If you are a Seller that is not part of our Seller Direct Program, your activities are governed by and subject to our Supplemental Terms for Sellers found here. Please note that SeatGeek cannot guarantee (a) that every Ticket purchased on SeatGeek will be eligible for resale on SeatGeek (such as, for example, a promoter for a tour requests resale to be disabled), or (b) that you will receive your Ticket from a Seller enough in advance of the event to enable you to resell the Ticket. In addition, you may not be able to list a Ticket for resale at your desired price (for example, we may impose a Ticket price cap for fraud purposes).\n\nSeatGeek Properties. The Digital Properties, the Services, and the information and content available on or in the Digital Properties and the Services (as these terms are defined herein) (collectively, the “SeatGeek Properties.”) are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Unless otherwise specified by SeatGeek in a separate license, your right to use any SeatGeek Properties is subject to the Terms.\n\nApplication License. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, SeatGeek grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install and use a copy of the Application on a single mobile device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal or internal business purposes. Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.\n\nUpdates. You understand that SeatGeek Properties are evolving. As a result, SeatGeek may require you to accept updates to SeatGeek Properties that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that SeatGeek may update SeatGeek Properties with or without notifying you. You may need to update third-party software from time to time in order to use SeatGeek Properties.\n\nCertain Restrictions.

Any future release, update or other addition to SeatGeek Properties shall be subject to the Terms. You further acknowledge and agree that (i) you will not access any Digital Property for the purpose of bringing a claim or action against SeatGeek including, but not limited to patent infringement or ADA compliance, and (ii) agree that violation of the foregoing will result in a fee of not less than $50,000. SeatGeek, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of SeatGeek Properties (in addition to any other right or remedies) shall result in the automatic and immediate termination of the licenses granted by SeatGeek pursuant to the Terms.\n\nSeatGeek Swaps. Unless otherwise indicated when you purchase the Ticket(s), you may return any Ticket(s) eligible for return pursuant to this SeatGeek Swaps policy to SeatGeek in exchange for a promotional code equal to the original price you paid for your Ticket(s), including all taxes and service fees, at any time up to 72 hours prior to the scheduled start time of your event (for packages or bundles of Tickets, 72 hours prior to the scheduled start time of the first event included in your package or bundle) (the “SeatGeek Swaps Deadline”), if you agree with the following:\n\nYou return your Ticket(s) by the SeatGeek Swaps Deadline in accordance with the instructions provided to you by SeatGeek;\n\nFor packages or bundles of Tickets, no partial return of the package or bundle is allowed, meaning that (1) only the entire package or bundle can be exchanged prior to the SeatGeek Swaps Deadline and (2) after the SeatGeek Swaps Deadline, none of the Tickets in the package or bundle may be returned pursuant to the SeatGeek Swaps policy;\n\nYou will not sell or resell the Ticket(s) and doing so will forfeit your eligibility to return your Ticket(s) pursuant to this Section 1.8;\n\nThe promotional code (1) shall be issued to you only after your Ticket(s) have been received by SeatGeek by the SeatGeek Swaps Deadline; (2) shall expire twelve (12) months from the date of issue; and (3) is only eligible for one-time use, meaning that if you use the promotional code on a purchase that is less than the value of the promotional code, you forfeit the remaining balance and may not use the promotional code again;\n\nNo more than one return pursuant to this SeatGeek Swaps policy is permitted within 30 calendar days; and\n\nAdditional terms may apply to your event as specified at the time you purchase your Ticket(s).\n\nRegistration.\n\nRegistering Your Account. In order to access certain features of SeatGeek Properties you may be required to become a Registered User. For purposes of the Terms, “Registered User” is an end user of the Services (“User”) who has registered an account on the Digital Properties (“Account”), or has a valid account on the social networking service (“SNS”) through which the User has connected to the Services (each such account, a “Third-Party Account\n\nAccess Through a SNS.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND SEATGEEK DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.\n\nRegistration Data In registering an account on the Services, you agree to (1) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.

SeatGeek reserves the right to request from Seller proof of purchase or any other documentary evidence for any listing that is suspected to be Speculative Ticketing. Failure to present adequate documentation within the timeframe requested by SeatGeek may result in the removal of the listing, account suspension or closure, or any other measures permitted under these Terms of Use.\n\nApp Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (“App Store”). You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and SeatGeek and not with the App Store. SeatGeek, not the App Store, is solely responsible for SeatGeek Properties, including the Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with SeatGeek Properties, including the Application. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using SeatGeek Properties, including the Application. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to enforce them.\n\nFees, Purchase Terms, and Credits.\n\nService Fees SeatGeek may charge fees for buying and/or selling Tickets through our Services, as well as delivery or fulfillment fees (collectively, “Service Fees”), which is made available to you prior to buying or selling a ticket. SeatGeek reserves the right at any time to change its Service Fees and billing methods. SeatGeek may retain Service Fees if you do not fulfill your obligations hereunder or if the Event is canceled. You must provide SeatGeek with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (“Payment Provider”) a condition to signing up for the Services (each, a “Payment Method”). Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit or debit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing SeatGeek with your credit or debit card number and associated payment information, you agree that SeatGeek is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to SeatGeek hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify SeatGeek of any change in your billing address or the credit or debit card used for payment hereunder.\n\nPayments by Buyers. As a Buyer you agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.\n\nEvent Cancellations and Postponement.\n\nEvent Cancellation. If an event is canceled and not rescheduled (a “Canceled Event”), SeatGeek will remove the event and any listing related to the event from the Services, and provide Buyers with notice of the cancellation and further instructions. Buyers are required to retain their Ticket(s) with respect to Canceled Events and send them back to SeatGeek or to the Seller, as directed by SeatGeek. A Buyer will receive a refund or, subject to applicable state laws, a credit, to be determined in SeatGeek's sole discretion, once the Buyer has sent back the Ticket(s) in the manner and within the timeline given by SeatGeek, and the Seller will not receive the Ticket Price. Please note that certain states require the refund of a Ticket if an event is canceled and SeatGeek's refund policy is intended at all times to comply with all applicable state laws. If you did not receive a refund for a canceled event but believe that you are entitled to one under applicable state law, please contact SeatGeek immediately at hi@seatgeek.com.\n\nEvent Postponement. If an event is postponed, SeatGeek will work with Buyers, on a case-by-case basis, to attempt to resolve the issues. Refunds or credits will not be issued for postponed events, unless they are canceled.\n\nOther Event Changes. SeatGeek is not responsible for any other event changes, such as partial performances, venue, line-up or time changes. No refunds or credits will be issued under such circumstances.\n\nTaxes. SeatGeek collects and remits Sales Tax on secondary sales in the following jurisdictions: Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Washington D.C. SeatGeek may collect and remit Sales Tax in additional jurisdictions in accordance with applicable regulatory and legislative changes. If any Services, or payments for any Services or Tickets, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify SeatGeek for any liability, penalties, interest or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that SeatGeek is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.\n\nWithholding Taxes. You agree to make all payments of fees to SeatGeek free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to SeatGeek will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide SeatGeek with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.\n\nThird Party Payment Provider. SeatGeek utilizes third-party payment processing services. The processing of payments may be subject to terms and conditions of the third-party payment processors in addition to these Terms of Use. You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be notified to the following address: Hi@Seatgeek.com.\n\nCredits. SeatGeek may offer promo codes, discount credits, or other types of credits (\"Credits\"). In order to utilize the Credit, you need to create an account through the Digital Properties and input your information. Credits will expire on the date stated in the offer. If no expiration date is listed, Credits will expire one year after the first day it can be utilized by you. Unless otherwise stated, a Credit is for one-time use only. Thus, if the total price of the Ticket(s) purchased is/are less than the monetary amount of the Credit, the difference cannot be utilized in subsequent purchases. Additionally, a Credit may not be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published either directly or indirectly in any form or stored in data retrieval systems without our prior written approval. SeatGeek reserves the right to withdraw or deactivate any Credit (other than one which has been purchased) for any reason, at any time. In some circumstances involving the Buyer Guarantee, you may be eligible to select either a refund or a Credit. Upon making a selection between either a refund or a Credit, you will not be able to switch your choice. Credits may only be redeemed through the Digital Properties, and not through any other website or method of communication.\n\nIndemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold SeatGeek, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (collectively, the “SeatGeek Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of: (a) as a Seller, the content of your listings and any errors, inaccuracies or omissions therein; (b) your use of, or inability to use, SeatGeek Properties; (c) your violation of the Terms; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any end users of the Services; (e) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations; or (f) any disputes or claims between you and any other User. SeatGeek reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with SeatGeek in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the SeatGeek Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Digital Properties or any Services provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, the Terms or your access to SeatGeek Properties.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranties and Conditions.\n\nAs Is.

If SeatGeek becomes aware of any possible violations by you of the Terms, SeatGeek reserves the right to investigate such violations. If, as a result of the investigation, SeatGeek believes that criminal activity has occurred, SeatGeek reserves the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all applicable legal authorities. SeatGeek is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on or in SeatGeek Properties in SeatGeek’s possession in connection with your use of SeatGeek Properties, to (1) comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental request; (2) enforce the Terms, (3) respond to your requests for customer service, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of SeatGeek, its Users or the public, and all enforcement or other government officials, as SeatGeek in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate.\n\nRight to Cancel Transaction; Other Remedies.\n\nRight to Cancel Transaction. In certain circumstances, we may cancel a Ticket transaction (whether a purchase, listing, and/or transfer) without notice and return the Tickets to our client or to the individual who held the Tickets prior to the completion of the transaction. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nif an event is canceled without being rescheduled;\n\nif the Buyer’s payment method provider does not remit payment;\n\nif we or our client suspects, in our sole discretion, unauthorized or fraudulent use of a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee’s account with us;\n\nif we or our client suspects, in our sole discretion, unauthorized or fraudulent use of a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee’s account with us;\n\nif a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee breaches these Terms of Use;\n\nif we or our client deems, in our sole discretion, that a Ticket transaction violates the law; and/or\n\nif there is an error in the pricing of a Ticket offered for sale through our Service; and/or\n\nif we or our client believes, in our sole discretion, that a buyer, seller, and/or transferee has otherwise engaged in inappropriate conduct in connection with a Ticket transaction.\n\nAs part of the cancellation of any Ticket transaction, SeatGeek may remove any relevant sales proceeds from the resale Ticket seller’s SeatGeek account, process a reversal of a prior funds transfer made to the seller or charge the payment method on file for such seller and/or cancel a pending Ticket transaction, whether for resale Tickets or primary Tickets.\n\nOther Remedies In certain circumstances, we may, in addition to any applicable remedies listed above, (a) discontinue an individual’s registration with any of the SeatGeek Properties, including any of the Services; and/or (b) pursue any other action which SeatGeek deems appropriate. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nif we or our client suspects, in our sole discretion, unauthorized or fraudulent use of a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee’s account with us;\n\nif we or our client suspects, in our sole discretion, unauthorized or fraudulent use of a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee’s account with us;\n\nif a Buyer, Seller, and/or transferee breaches these Terms of Use;\n\nif we or our client deems, in our sole discretion, that a Ticket transaction violates the law; and/or\n\nif we or our client believes, in our sole discretion, that a buyer, seller, and/or transferee has otherwise engaged in inappropriate conduct in connection with a Ticket transaction.\n\nTerm and Termination.\n\nTerm. The Terms commence on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use SeatGeek Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Terms.\n\nPrior Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you used SeatGeek Properties prior to the date you accepted the Terms, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Terms commenced on the date you first used SeatGeek Properties (whichever is earlier) and will remain in full force and effect while you use SeatGeek Properties, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Terms.\n\nTermination of Services by SeatGeek. If timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Provider for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, or if SeatGeek is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Digital Properties or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), SeatGeek has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in SeatGeek’s sole discretion and that SeatGeek shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.\n\nTermination of Services by You. If you want to terminate the Services provided by SeatGeek, you may do so by ceasing to use the Services.\n\nEffect of Termination. Termination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Upon termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. SeatGeek will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.\n\nNo Subsequent Registration. If your registration(s) with or ability to access SeatGeek Properties is discontinued by SeatGeek due to your violation of any portion of the Terms, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access SeatGeek Properties through use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those SeatGeek Properties to which your access has been terminated. In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, SeatGeek reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.\n\nInternational Users. SeatGeek Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that SeatGeek intends to announce such Services in your country. SeatGeek Properties are controlled and offered by SeatGeek from its facilities in the United States of America. SeatGeek makes no representations that SeatGeek Properties are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use SeatGeek Properties from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.\n\nDispute Resolution.\n\nTHIS SECTION SETS FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND SEATGEEK WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”). PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND SEATGEEK TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND SEATGEEK FROM SUING IN COURT. YOU AND SEATGEEK AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU AND SEATGEEK ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND SEATGEEK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.\n\nDispute Resolution/Notice Regarding Mandatory Arbitration. SeatGeek is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have an issue, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, the process for pursuing claims is explained in this section. You and SeatGeek agree to give the other an opportunity to resolve any Disputes informally by sending us written notice. If you assert a Dispute against SeatGeek, you will first contact SeatGeek by sending written notice (“Claimant Notice”) to “SeatGeek Legal Department: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at 902 Broadway, Floor 10, New York, New York 10010, with an email copy to legal@seatgeek.com. The Claimant Notice must (i) include your name, address, user name (if any), email address you used to set up your SeatGeek account (if any), and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. If SeatGeek asserts a Dispute against you, SeatGeek will first contact you by sending a written notice (“SeatGeek Notice”) to you via email to the primary email address associated with your account. The SeatGeek Notice must (i) include the name of a SeatGeek contact and the contact’s email address and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.\n\nInformal Dispute Resolution. You and SeatGeek agree to give each other an opportunity to resolve any Dispute through an informal dispute resolution process within sixty (60) days after receipt of a Claimant or SeatGeek Notice. If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after email receipt of a Notice, then either party shall have the right to submit the Dispute to binding arbitration or in small claims court as set forth below. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for sixty (60) days from the date that either you or SeatGeek receive a Claimant or SeatGeek Notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\n\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement. Except as specifically stated in this Section, any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and SeatGeek and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or any of their respective members, officers, directors, and employees (all such entities collectively referred to herein as the “SeatGeek Entities”) arising out of, relating in any way to, or in connection with the Terms, the SeatGeek website, Application or Services or your use of the SeatGeek website, Application or Services, your personal information, or any aspect of your relationship with SeatGeek, including any dispute, claim, or controversy that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior versions thereof required arbitration (“Dispute(s)”), shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration; except that: (a) you or SeatGeek may bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, (b) you or SeatGeek may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain name, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents), or (c) you or SeatGeek may seek equitable relief in court for any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the security of the SeatGeek website, Application or Services or the general business interests of SeatGeek.\n\nFederal Arbitration Act. These Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) (“FAA”), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration and any arbitration proceedings.\n\nRules and Forum. The arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) in accordance with its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect when the arbitration is commenced, except as modified by this Section. The NAM Rules are available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms. The NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the “NAM Mass Filing Rules”) will apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against SeatGeek by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“Mass Filing”). Any arbitration hearing will be conducted by videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the place shall be the county where you reside or at another agreed upon locale, unless the Batch Arbitration process discussed below applies in which case the arbitrator will determine the locale.\n\nBatch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of any such Mass Filing, you and SeatGeek also agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual arbitrations of a substantially similar nature filed against SeatGeek by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 claims left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). To the extent the parties disagree on any issue arising out of relating to the Batch Arbitration, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Procedural Arbitrator”). The Procedural Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by SeatGeek. This provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. All parties agree that arbitrations are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.\n\nFees and Costs. You and SeatGeek will be required to pay fees as assessed by NAM in accordance with the NAM Rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\nConfidentiality. You and SeatGeek agree that the existence of the arbitration, all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings, and the arbitration award shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. If you or SeatGeek submits a dispute to arbitration and the arbitrator orders any exchange of information, you and SeatGeek agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and/or other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and SeatGeek agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, and/or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.\n\nAward. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.\n\nArbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be selected by the parties from NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except that all Disputes arising out of or relating to class action waiver including any claim that it is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by the courts as described below in Section 15.6 and not by an arbitrator.\n\nJury Trial Waiver. YOU AND SEATGEEK HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and SeatGeek are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in this Section. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n\nClass Action Waiver. YOU AND SEATGEEK FURTHER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED ABOVE IN CONNECTION WITH THE BATCHING PROCESS, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision is rendered, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that any provision of this Subsection 14.13 (“Class Action Waiver”) is invalid or unenforceable as to a particular request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and SeatGeek agree that that particular request for relief (and only that particular request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the courts as described below in Section 15.6 after the arbitration is completed. This subsection does not prevent you or SeatGeek from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\nOne Year to Assert Claims. You and SeatGeek agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, and except as tolled herein, any Dispute must be filed in arbitration or small claims court within one year after such claim arose or it will be forever banned.\n\n30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: SeatGeek Legal Department, 902 Broadway, Floor 10, New York, NY 10010, within 30 days after first agreeing or becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your SeatGeek username (if any), the email address you used to set up your SeatGeek account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.\n\nSeverability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\nSurvival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with SeatGeek.\n\nModification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, SeatGeek may make modifications, deletions, and additions to this Arbitration Agreement from time to time. Changes will be posted here, which you should regularly check for the most recent version. If you continue to use the Services after the effective date of any changes to this Arbitration Agreement, then you are deemed to have accepted those revisions. For any such change, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing SeatGeek at the following address: SeatGeek Legal Department, 902 Broadway, Floor 10, New York, NY 10010. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against SeatGeek or you prior to the effective date of the modification. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or the Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. SeatGeek will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.\n\nGeneral Provisions."
