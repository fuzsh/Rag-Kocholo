        "text": "Viacom, American communications and media conglomerate that was once one of the largest in the United States. It owned radio and television stations and cable television programming services and systems. The company underwent various mergers, notably forming ViacomCBS (later Paramount Global) with CBS Corporation in 2019. At that time Viacom ceased to exist as a distinct entity. Headquarters were in New York City.\n\nViacom was formed in 1971 by CBS Inc. to operate cable TV systems and to syndicate such popular CBS series as I Love Lucy after the Federal Communications Commission prohibited television networks from performing such activities. In 1976 it established the Showtime movie network, and in 1985 it bought the MTV networks, including the music video channels MTV and VH-1 as well as the Nickelodeon channel for children. In 1987 Viacom became a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Amusements Inc. movie theatre chain. It continued to expand, acquiring more radio and television stations, adding cable channels and franchises, and producing films for Showtime and several popular television series for the networks.\n\nIn 1994 Viacom acquired Paramount Communications Inc., a media conglomerate that had been founded in 1958 as Gulf + Western Corporation. Among the major businesses Paramount brought to Viacom were Paramount Pictures Corporation, Simon & Schuster, Inc., and Madison Square Garden (later sold by Viacom). Viacom’s subsequent merger with Blockbuster added video rental and music retail operations to its considerable film, cable, television, and publishing holdings, making it one of the most diversified entertainment companies in the world.\n\nIn 1995 Viacom’s Paramount unit and Chris-Craft Industries launched a new broadcasting network called United Paramount Network; in 2006 the channel merged with the WB to form the CW. In 1999 Viacom announced that it would acquire CBS Corporation; the merger was completed the following year. Viacom purchased Black Entertainment Television (BET) in 2001. However, a complicated split of Viacom and CBS took place in 2006, with Viacom retaining only MTV, BET, and Paramount Pictures. Both Viacom and CBS remained under the control of National Amusements. In 2019 the two companies once again merged and assumed the name ViacomCBS (later Paramount Global). While CBS and Paramount continued as distinct entities, Viacom did not."
