        "text": "Once dubbed the undisputed king of the private equity industry by Forbes magazine, Stephen Schwarzman is one of the wealthiest people in the U.S. with a net worth of $37.3 billion—making him the 79th richest person in the world. The investment company he founded, The Blackstone Group (BX), is one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world, with $684 billion worth of assets under management as of Sept. 2021. Schwarzman and his team are responsible for overseeing the allocation of capital for several pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, and other institutional investors.\n\nWith a wide range of global business interests in private equity, debt financing, hedge fund management, and real estate acquisitions, Schwarzman is one of the most powerful people on Wall Street. He was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in 2007. A benevolent billionaire, Schwarzman has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to different causes over the years.\n\nHere is an overview of how he made his fortune and built the world’s most powerful alternative asset manager.\n\nStephen Schwarzman's Early Life and Education\n\nSchwarzman says, ‘‘I stopped [studying math] in the eleventh grade. Calculus, for me, was way out of reach. I am more in the add, subtract, divide and multiply category, which worked and still does for me.’’\n\nWith no interest in corporate finance, Schwarzman took social science-related courses like psychology and sociology during his time at Yale. While in school, Schwarzman and Former United States President George W. Bush were members of Yale’s infamous secret society Skull and Bones.\n\nThe Start of Stephen Schwarzman's Career\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1969, Schwarzman managed to get a job with an institutional asset management firm called Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ). At the time, the company had just been listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Now defunct, it was co-founded by Bill Donaldson who also founded the Yale School of Management.\n\nSchwarzman developed a love for the world of corporate finance at the firm. There he learned about the stock market, the money management business, and how to analyze financial statements. On one occasion at DLJ, Schwarzman was tasked to interview an executive of a publicly-traded company to determine if its stock would make a good investment. However, many of the questions he asked were not answered. Schwarzman later found out that the executive was not trying to be difficult but rather did not want to disclose certain details about the company due to insider trading laws.\n\nAlthough he understood why the executive could not answer his questions, Schwarzman was uncomfortable with analyzing a potential investment without having all the important and relevant information about it at hand. This frustrated him, so decided to further his studies at the Harvard Business School, with the hope of finding a way to resolve this issue.\n\nThe Beginning of Blackstone Group\n\nWith a Harvard MBA under his belt in 1972, Schwarzman took on a job at the then-independent investment giant, Lehman Brothers. By the age of 31, he had become the Managing Director of Global Mergers and Acquisitions for Lehman. Following American Express Company’s (AXP) acquisition of Lehman Brothers in 1984, Schwarzman left the firm. He approached Pete Peterson, his former boss who had left Lehman earlier that year, with the idea of starting an investment company.\n\nOne year later, in 1985, Schwarzman and Peterson formed The Blackstone Group with $400,000 of their own money. Never a fan of being a stock market speculator, Schwarzman wanted to make private equity investing the heart of Blackstone's business model.\n\nHe knew that privately-held businesses provided their investors and potential investors with a lot more transparency when compared with publicly traded companies. This access to detailed information would allow Blackstone to scrutinize investment opportunities more closely.\n\nSince Schwarzman and Peterson had very little experience in the private equity industry, investors were initially hesitant about giving them money to launch their first fund. The duo decided to operate as a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory boutique for the next few years to build credibility. One of the company’s most notable accomplishments occurred in 1988 when Blackstone advised CBS Corporation (CBS) on the sale of its subsidiary CBS Records to Sony Corporation (SNE).\n\nEntering the Private Equity World\n\nSchwarzman successfully raised $800 million in 1987 for Blackstone's first private equity fund, Blackstone Capital Partners I, L.P. Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU), and General Motors Company (GM) were two of the fund's largest investors. The money raised was used to purchase companies using a strategy called leveraged buyouts (LBOs).\n\nPrivate equity funds are typically formed as limited partnerships (LPs). Outside investors, who contribute to most of the partnership's capital; since they play a non-active role in management, are known as limited partners. The general partner, who in this case is Blackstone, contributes a rather small amount of money to the partnership and is responsible for allocating the pooled money into several different investment opportunities.\n\nAs a result, the general partner receives a management fee, which is normally a percentage of the total assets in the partnership as well as a percentage of the profits realized.\n\nFor instance, say that Blackstone uses the standard industry fund management compensation structure of 2% of assets under management and 20% of profits. If Blackstone manages a limited partnership with a total asset base of $500 million that realizes a $150 million return in a given year, it would receive $40 million in fees—2% of $500 million, plus 20% of $150 million. Blackstone would also make additional money on the actual capital that it invests in the partnership.\n\nSince its inception, Blackstone has raised more than $100 billion for its eight private equity funds alone. Its latest fund, Blackstone Capital Partners VIII, collected $26 billion in 2019.\n\nAccording to Schwarzman's presentation at Yale, his private equity funds realized an annual average return of 23% from 1988 to 2008.\n\nExpanded Business Segments and IPO\n\nSince launching his firm's first private equity fund in 1988, Schwarzman has significantly expanded Blackstone's business segments. The company continues to provide mergers and acquisitions advice as well as private equity fund management. In addition, Blackstone manages several funds of hedge funds and real estate investment partnerships. In 2012, Schwarzman's real estate team started buying single-family houses across the U.S. with the hope of turning them into rental properties—buying 50,000 over the next three to four years.\n\nSchwarzman took The Blackstone Group public in 2007; originally an LP, it became a C corporation (C-corp) in 2019. The initial public offering raised more than $4 billion. In 2014, it was reported that Schwarzman received $690 million in Blackstone dividends alone.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStephen Schwarzman became a billionaire by managing money for other people. Dissatisfied by the level of transparency offered by the stock market, Schwarzman co-founded The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, in the mid-1980s. Today, Blackstone is one of the world's largest alternative asset managers. The company collects fees for managing hundreds of billions of dollars for several institutional investors."
