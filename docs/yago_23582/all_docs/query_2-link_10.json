Their romance started in 1912 while Albert was still married to his first wife, and they married 3 months after his divorce from Mileva was finalized. Elsa was a protector and caretaker for her husband. Despite his many extramarital affairs, they remained a devoted couple until her death in 1936. Shortly before she died, she commented to a friend on how her illness affected Einstein: \"I never thought he loved me so much.\""
