His parents were Hermann and Pauline Einstein. Einstein already showed a unique talent for mathematics and physics in his childhood.\n\nAlbert Einstein's Education\n\nIn 1896, Einstein passed the Maturitätsprüfung (comparable to the current German Abitur, an exam students take at 18-19 to gain access to university) and began his studies at the Zurich Polytechnic (today's ETH Zurich).\n\nYou may have often heard that Einstein failed maths. That's not true! He had a 6 in maths, which in Switzerland is the best grade you can get.\n\nAfter graduating in 1901, Einstein worked as a substitute teacher and tutor because his applications for assistant positions at the Zurich Polytechnic were rejected. In 1902 Einstein got a job as a so-called technical expert at the patent office in Bern, which was arranged for him by his friend Marcel Grossmann.\n\nOne of the most important years for Einstein's scientific life was 1905. Several of his most important works were published that year, in particular:\n\nHis work on the photoelectric effect, for which Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nA work on Brownian molecular motion.\n\nHis work on the special theory of relativity, in which Einstein's most famous formula was mentioned for the first time.\n\nHe also completed his dissertation \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), and his official doctorate followed in 1906.\n\nFrom his thoughts on special relativity, Einstein developed the famous General Theory of Relativity from 1907 to 1915, which described the influence of matter on space-time and gave a new picture of gravity. During this period, Einstein was habilitated at the University of Bern, and taught at the University of Zurich and the University of Prague.\n\nIn 1914, Einstein returned to Germany and accepted a position as a professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, where Einstein found the time to complete the General Theory of Relativity.\n\nIn 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize \"for his services to theoretical physics, especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".\n\nIn 1932, at a time of increasing political instability in Germany, Einstein emigrated to America and took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. He worked here until his retirement.\n\nEinstein died on the 18th of April 1955 at the age of 76 of the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The enlarged wall of his aorta burst and he refused to undergo an operation to treat it.\n\nAlbert Einstein's Family and Interests\n\nAlbert Einstein met his first wife, Mileva Marić, while studying at ETH Zurich. Marić was also a mathematician and physicist. She was indeed the second woman to finish a full program of study at the Department of Mathematics and Physics at ETH Zurich, and the only woman in her year. Einstein and Marić were collaborators as well as a couple. The debate as to whether Marić contributed significantly to Eintein's theories and papers is still ongoing.\n\nEinstein and Marić married on 6th January 1903 in Bern. It seems that after their marriage, Marić's scientific career was stunted. Einstein and Mileva had a daughter, Lieserl, and later two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. To this day it is still unclear what happened with their daughter. She was probably born in 1902/1903 and either died young or was given up for adoption. Her existence only became known in 1987 from personal correspondence between Marić and Einstein.\n\nEinstein's marriage with Marić came to an end in 1919, although they had separated before. Marić has taken the couple's sons after the separation. She agreed to the divorce only on the condition that she would receive the money for the Nobel Prize if Einstein won it.\n\nIn the same year of the divorce, Albert Einstein married his cousin Elsa, who brought her two daughters into the marriage. In 1936 Elsa Einstein died in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1939 Einstein's sister Maja joined Einstein in exile from Nazi Germany, as Einstein's family was Jewish. She lived with Einstein in his Princeton home until her death in 1951.\n\nAlbert Einstein's political convictions and interests\n\nAlbert Einstein was a convinced pacifist and socialist. He was concerned about political developments in Europe and opposed fascism and National Socialism. In 1932 he emigrated to the USA because he no longer felt safe in Germany. In the USA, he campaigned for peace and justice and supported numerous political and social movements.\n\nFurthermore, Alber Einstein was a man with many interests and passions. He was an enthusiastic musician and played the piano and violin. He was also a passionate reader and interested in philosophy, art and natural sciences. He was vegetarian and opposed all forms of violence, including hunting. In his spare time, he enjoyed walking alone in nature and solving problems.\n\nWhat did Albert Einstein discover?\n\nDuring his life, Albert Einstein was involved in many important discoveries and inventions that are still of very high importance for the understanding of modern physics.\n\nGeneral Theory of Relativity\n\nEinstein published the General Theory of Relativity in 1915. The General Theory of Relativity explains that gravity should not be considered as a force exerted on bodies, but as a consequence of the distortion of the space-time continuum by massive objects. This theory has fundamental implications for our understanding of space, time, gravity and much more. Einstein's most famous formula is related to the theory of relativity:\n\n\\[E = mc^2\\]\n\nwhere E stands for the energy of a particle, m for the mass of that particle and c for the speed of light. In other words, he established that the energy of a particle is proportional to its mass.\n\nIt was only in 2015 that experimental evidence was found for the gravitational waves predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The event was recorded at the LIGO detector and was generated by the collision of two black holes. The discoverers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for it in 2017.\n\nGravitational waves are temporally and spatially propagating distortions of space-time triggered by accelerating masses.\n\nSpecial Theory of Relativity\n\nEinstein stated in 1905 that the laws of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of whether or not they are moving at a constant speed. This led to the concept of the relativity of observers.\n\nOne of the most well-known effects of special relativity is time dilation. This means that time passes more slowly for an object in motion than for an object at rest. This can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n\\[\\Delta t' = \\frac {\\Delta t}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\]\n\nWhere Δt is the duration of time for an observer at rest, Δt' is the duration of time for an observer in motion, v is the speed of the object in motion and c is the speed of light.\n\nImagine you are flying in a rocket at 99.9% of the speed of light relative to the Earth. For you, time passes quite \"normally\". On Earth, however, time passes 22.4 times faster. In those conditions, when 10 years have gone by for you, it will have been 224 years on Earth!\n\nThe Photoelectric Effect\n\nEinstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. He discovered that light can exist not only as electromagnetic waves but also as particles (photons).\n\nEinstein explained the photoelectric effect with the idea that photons can transmit their energy to material particles through absorption. This transfer of energy can cause particles to shoot out of the material.\n\nThis can be represented mathematically by the formula:\n\n\\[E = hf\\]\n\nWhere E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nThe photoelectric effect has had far-reaching effects on modern physics and has contributed to the development of technologies such as solar cells and photodetectors.\n\nSolar cells are electronic components of solar panels that can turn the energy of solar light directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect.\n\nPhotodetectors are optoelectronic devices which can transform UV, visible and infrared radiation into electrical signals.\n\nQuotes by Albert Einstein\n\nAlbert Einstein is not only known for his scientific discoveries, but also for his profound and inspiring quotes. Here are some of his most famous quotes:\n\n\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\"\n\n\"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\"\n\n\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\"\n\n\"Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein's death\n\nAlbert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76 at the Princeton Hospital in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. He suffered a haemorrhage that required medical intervention, but he refused it. He approached the end of his life with calmness, and accepted that it was time allegedly better than those around him.\n\nAfter his death, a surgeon removed his brain without the consent of Eintein's family. He studied the brain of one of the most renowned scientists of all time for many years, until 2007."
