        "text": "While just about everyone has heard of Albert Einstein, very few are aware of the scientific contributions of his first wife, Mileva Marić Einstein. A trained physicist like him, Mileva, despite being highly talented, was denied a degree and could not work as a physicist. By today's standards, she would be seen as his full-fledge collaborator and would have shared some of the fame he received alone. Mileva Marić was a highly talented scientist who was denied having her chance at a scientific career due to the historical context and her personal circumstances. She collaborated with Albert Einstein during his most productive years. Find out more about this extraordinary physicist in my book or through the various ressources listed below."
