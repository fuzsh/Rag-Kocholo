        "text": "Bryan Szeglin, M.D. ’21, and Anna Catherine Bitners, M.D. ’21\n\nBryan and Anna met during orientation week at Einstein in August 2016 as first-year medical students. As they sat in the front row of Riklis Auditorium for their first lectures, they realized they were fellow introverts and became friends. Their relationship grew stronger as they became anatomy lab partners, studied together in the library and the Belfer classrooms, traveled to New Rochelle Hospital for intensive care medicine, and spent weekends in the campus courtyards. Ultimately, the couple matched at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine—Bryan for general surgery and Anna for pediatrics. Bryan proposed in October of their intern year, and they got married on August 18, 2022.\n\nToday, the couple lives in Baltimore, MD, near Patterson Park with their two cats, Theo and Sophia. Next year, Bryan will continue his surgical training as a fourth-year resident investigating peritoneal malignancies, and Anna will remain at Hopkins for a neonatology fellowship.\n\nHadassah (Dassie) Orenstein, M.D. ’81, and Abraham Eddy Barth, M.D. ’81\n\nDassie and Abraham met during their first year of medical school. They lived in the same dorm, ate in the same cafeteria, attended some of the same classes, and hung out at Max & Sadie’s on beanbag chairs watching M*A*S*H with their classmates. The day after they got engaged, they went into the auditorium for class, and everyone gave them a standing ovation and presented them with flowers. They got married in August 1979. After graduation, Abraham became an anesthesiologist and Dassie pursued a career in physical medicine and rehabilitation. Currently, the couple has seven children and 14 grandchildren.\n\nAbraham shared that Albert Einstein once said, “Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.” While he agrees with that statement, he says Einstein was responsible for his and Dassie’s love story.\n\nAkarsh Vijayashankar, M.D. ’21, and Sneha Saha, M.D. ’22\n\nAkarsh and Sneha met on a crowded dance floor in the Glass Cafe at Einstein’s annual “Around the World” party. To this day, they can’t agree on who made the first move. Akarsh insists that Sneha confidently approached him and asked him to dance. Meanwhile, Sneha maintains that she was just looking for a fun night out with her friends. Over the next four years, the couple journeyed through medical school, supported each other through two residency matches, and entered a new phase of “short distance” dating between New York and Connecticut. During that time, they explored three countries, met each other’s extended families in India, and mastered the art of cooking chicken tikka masala. In June 2022, shortly after Sneha's Einstein graduation and her recent move to New Haven for residency, Akarsh realized he felt closer to her than ever. One sunny afternoon by the Brooklyn Bridge waterfront, he got down on one knee and asked her to marry him. (He claims that there was a speech, but Sneha could not remember this part.) Akarsh and Sneha are planning to get married on February 22, 2024, in Bangalore, India, surrounded by their family and some of their Einstein classmates.\n\nBryan Zarrin, M.D. ’20, and Michelle Nosratian Zarrin, M.D. ’24\n\nBryan and Michelle met during Einstein’s “Around the World” event, a longstanding tradition in which upperclassmen host a party for first-year students after their first histology exam. The party eventually moved to the Glass Cafe behind Robbins Auditorium. One of Bryan’s friends, who Michelle had worked with as a volunteer at the Einstein Free Clinic as a pre-medical student, suggested that he speak to this “pretty Persian girl” that he thought was Bryan’s type. Bryan spent the night trying to chat Michelle up and managed to get her number. A few months went by as he completed rotations off campus. Then, one day, they ran into each other three times in the elevator of 1925 Eastchester Road, where they lived six floors apart. After the third run-in, Bryan texted her and asked if she wanted to have Oreos and milk and watch The Office at his place, an offer she could not refuse. They discovered their shared love of the Lakers, and Michelle started coming over to watch games. On November 23, 2019, they went on their first date in Brooklyn, and Bryan proposed in front of Jane’s Carousel in Dumbo in January 2022. They were married at the Brooklyn Museum over Memorial Day weekend in 2022."
