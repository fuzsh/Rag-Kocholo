R. J. DORNAN.\n\nREFERENCE BY REV. DR. MEGAW\n\nRev. R. T. Megaw, LL/D/, preaching in College Square on Sabbath morning last, from Revelation xix. 7, made the following reference to the late Mr. R. J. Dornan, clerk of session:-- We meet to-day under the sense of a great and irreparable loss through the removal from our midst of Mr. R. J. Dornan, our beloved session clerk and our willing and zealous helper in every good work. This day fortnight he was here in his accustomed seat. To-day he worships in the heavenly places, giving praise unto Him, that loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God. It is difficult to realise just yet that we shall see his face no more here on earth. The blank in our church life is very great, and it will not be easily filled, but I trust others will do their best to take up and carry on the work he did so zealously, so courageously, so winsomely, and so successfully. For though often he was with us in great weakness of body, he never shirked duty. Mr. Dornan was still a young man when his call came, and we expected that for many years we should have the benefit of his wise counsel, his ready assistance, his genial companionship, and his Christian example. But God has willed otherwise, and we desire to bow reverently before Him, knowing that He doeth all things well. Still we mourn our beloved friend very deeply, and we feel we are very much the poorer through his bodily absence from us.\n\nMr. Dornan was a man of clear judgment, of fine ability, of high character, and of untiring zeal in all good works. He laboured earnestly in the Sabbath-school, and in the cause of temperance, and he was a very efficient clerk of session. He had a deep interest in evangelistic work, and never spared himself in trying to commend Christ to the world. His visits to our homes were always welcome. He was a very sympathetic man, and a man who possessed in quite a remarkable degree the milk of human kindness and the genius for friendship. During ail the years I have been so closely associated with him I never saw his frown, I never heard him speak an uncharitable or bitter or unworthy word, and I never knew him to do an act unbecoming a follower of Jesus Christ. Rather, indeed, he was a succourer of many, and of me also. We mourn our loss, but what is our loss is his gain. He has been promoted to higher service because God saw he had, by divine grace, made himself ready for it. Surely his devoted, modest, self-forgetting, Christ-like life should tell upon us who are left behind; for he being dead yet speaketh. And if he could audibly speak to us to-day, would he not say, \"Be ye also ready?\" We offer our profound condolence to his family in this hour of their sore distress and desolation, and we pray that God, who is the Father of the fatherless, the widow's shield and the orphan's stay, may guide and bless and keep them through all their years on earth, and fit them for a glad reunion with their beloved one on the other shore! Amen.\n\n=========================\n\nNOTABLE WEDDINGS IN DERRY.\n\nA double wedding that created a great deal of interest in the Maiden City was celebrated in First Derry Presbyterian Church on Wednesday, the marriages solemnised being those of Miss Margaret Chambers Johnston to Mr. Noel Stafford Robinson, and Miss Kathleen Maude Johnston to Mr. Gerald Ackroyd Simpson. The brides are the daughters of Alderman Sir John B. Johnston, J.P. ex-Mayor of Londonderry, and Lady Johnston, Crawford Square, and sisters of Mr. J Weir Johnston, Barrister-at-Law; while the bridegrooms are the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. Geo. H. Robinson, of Red Stables, Cotterstone, Yorkshire, and the only son of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Simpson,, of Catteral Hall, Settle, Yorkshire. Long before the time fixed for the ceremony the church was filled to overflowing. Punctually at the appointed hour Miss Johnston, leaning on the arm of her father, entered by the right aisle, while by the left Miss Kathleen Johnston entered on the arm of her brother (Mr. J. Weir Johnston). Miss Johnston's pages were Masters Terence and Brian Magee. Miss Kathleen Johnston's bridesmaids were her cousin, Miss Patricia Johnston, and Miss Edith Thompson. Mr. Walter Lowry acted as best man to Mr. Stafford Robinson, and Mr. Thomas Simpson filled the same position for Mr. Ackroyd Simpson. Rev. Dr. James M'Granahan, minister of First Derry Presbyterian Church, was the officiating clergyman. After the ceremony a reception was held at Crawford Square by the brides' parents.\n\nAt 3-30 Mr. and Mrs. Ackroyd Simpson left by the mail train en route for London and the Channel Islands, where the honeymoon will be spent. Later Mr. and Mrs. Stafford Robinson left by motor for a tour in Ireland and the South of England.\n\n=========================\n\nDEATH OF FORMER CITY MISSIONARY\n\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr. Hugh Donaldson, which took place at his home, 30, Eia Street, on Wednesday. The deceased, who had reached the age of ninety, was formerly one of the most devoted officials of the Belfast City Mission, and was the means of doing much good amongst the classes whom he visited. The deceased gentleman came to Belfast from London, where from 1875 he had been actively engaged as a missionary, and took up a position in the City Mission. This he held until 1895, when he retired. The funeral will take place to the City Cemetery at 2-30 to-day.\n\n^ top of page\n\nThe Witness - Friday, 8 May, 1914\n\nMarriages\n\nBANKS--HARPER -- April 28, 1914, at Oldpark Presbyterian Church, Belfast, by the Rev.

The testator left his household and personal effects to his wife.\n\nA man named Wilson Lindsay, who lives near Ardstraw, Co. Tyrone, found a pearl in the River Derg on Saturday last which he has sold for £20. The River Derg, which flows from Lough Derg -- well-known for its Catholic Pilgrimages -- is a river beloved of pearl-fishers.\n\nThe death was announced on the 30th ult. of Mr. L. M'Manaway, son of Rev. Canon M'Manaway, rector of Monaghan. The deceased had been ailing for some time, and was undergoing special treatment in a private hospital in Dublin. Much sympathy is extended to Canon M'Manaway in his sad bereavement.\n\nA shocking accident occurred on the Donegal Railway on Monday, when a farm hand named T. Allison, aged about forty years, of Caffrey, hear Stranorlar, sustained terrible injuries to his head by being knocked down by a train, and grave fears are entertained as to his recovery. The accident occurred at a level crossing leading to a farm.\n\nOn Saturday Dr. H. S. Morrison (Coroner for Coleraine district) held an inquest at Altikeeragh, near Castlerock, on the body of George Pollock, aged forty-seven, farmer, who died in a neighbour's house on the previous evening. Dr. James Steel, J.P., Articlave, deposed that the cause of death was heart failure. Verdict accordingly.\n\nThe Volunteers of Clones and district, including portion of County Cavan, marched to the Parish Church of Drummully on Sunday morning to the number of about 250, and attended service there. The special preacher was the Rev. Mr. Gamble, Crom. After the service was over the party assembled on the road outside the church, where they were addressed by Major-General Madden.\n\nDuring the past week the members of the 2nd Battalion South Down Regiment of the Ulster Volunteers stationed in Newry have been very busy every evening. The companies parade every evening at the drill hall in Sugar Island -- which, by the way, is watched by the police almost night and day -- and go out in squads through the country for the purpose of picketing and field drill.\n\nAn outbreak of fire which occurred at Limavady on the night of the 1st inst. in the home of Hannah Campbell, a nonagenarian, might readily have resulted in the death of the oldest resident in the town. The window curtains took fire, but fortunately simultaneously the members of First Limavady Boys' Brigade, returning from their weekly drill saw the blaze when passing the house, and a number immediately rushed within and lost no time in subduing the outbreak.\n\nTo the long list of enterprising Castledawson men who have emigrated to other lands only to meet with sudden and violent deaths when they had won comfortable positions for themselves must now be added the name of Mr. Samuel Loughrey, brother of Mr. Robt. Loughrey Castledawson. His relatives here at home have just received the melancholy tidings that Mr. Loughrey fell to the bottom of a five-storey elevator shaft in Chicago some days ago, and was killed instantly. The late Mr. Toughrey was the owner of an electrical engineering works.\n\nMr Fred. W. Pollock, Town Clerk of Lurgan, has received intimation from the Council's Parliamentary agents that the Board of Trade had granted a Provisional Order sanctioning the Council's electric lighting scheme.\n\nHOME.\n\nThe death occured on Sunday at 56, Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square, at the age of 84, of Cecilia, widow of General Lord Alfred Paget, C.B., great aunt of the present Lord Angelsey, and mother of General Sir Arthur Paget, Commanding-in-Chief, Irish Command. Lady Alfred Paget was the second daughter and co-heir of Mr. G. T. Wyndham, of Cromer Hall, Norfolk, by Maria, his wife, afterwards Countess of Listowel, daughter of Admiral Wyndham of Fellbrigg. She married Lord Alfred Paget (who died in 1888) in 1847, and had six sons and eight daughters.\n\nFOREIGN.\n\nNew York, Monday. -- The death occurred yesterday of Major-General Daniel Edgar Sickles as the result of cerebral hemorrhage. General Sickles, who was born in 1825, first learned the printing trade, and afterwards became successively a lawyer, Diplomat, politician, and soldier. He was Secretary of Legation in London in 1853, and later occupied the posts of United States Minister to Holland and Spain. During the Civil War hr commanded a corps in the army of the Potomac, and lost a leg at the Battle of Gettysburg, being subsequently awarded the Congressional medal of honour for distinguished gallantry in the action. He was also a commander of the Legion of Honour of France.\n\n=========================\n\nFUNERAL OF MR. H. DONALDSON\n\nOn Friday the funeral of the late Mr. Hugh Donaldson, who for so many years was an active worker on behalf of the Belfast City Mission, took place from his late residence, 30, Eia Street, Belfast, to the City Cemetery, and the large and representative cortege which followed the remains to the place of interment showed the esteem and respect in which he was held by all who knew him. A short service was conducted in the house, and also at the graveside. The funeral arrangements were in the capable hands of Messrs. Melville & Co., Townsend Street, and were admirably carried out.\n\n^ top of page\n\nThe Witness - Friday, 15 May, 1914\n\nBirths\n\nM'QUITTY -- May 5, at The Manse, Templepatrick, to the Rev. and Mrs. Luke M'Quitty, of a daughter.\n\nQUIN -- May 4, at Marlacoo House, Portadown Mr. and Mrs. R.

A. ROBB. Charleyville, Bushey Park, Newtownards.\n\nClippings\n\nTRIBUTE TO LATE MRS. WHALEY, WARINGSTOWN.\n\nThe Rev. J. M. M'Ilrath, B.A., formerly minister of Waringstown, and now of Donegall Road Church, Belfast, occupied his old pulpit on the 3rd inst. Preaching from Psalm xxiii. 4 he said the Christian had three blessings in his passage from world to world -- (1) Confidence, \"I will not fear:\" (2) company, \"Thou are with me;\" and (3) comfort, \"Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.\" At the close of an impressive sermon he said, \"And now a few words regarding one who has recently passed the valley of the shadow. As you know, it was never my habit to indulge in funeral eulogies, and in this case our friend was so well known that a panegyric would be superfluous. At the same time it would be unseemly to allow one who occupied such a prominent and honoured place in this congregation to pass away without some public reference. It is now almost thirty years since I became acquainted with Mrs. Whaley. That day I was her guest, and ever since I have had reason to regard her house as the Master must have esteemed the home in Bethany. For the ministers of the Gospel Knockboy had an ever open door. Mrs. Whaley was like the great lady at Shoneen who furnished a chamber for the man of God. Nor was it only to ministers her hospitality extended. She was 'a succourer of many,' for her generosity was proverbial. I doubt if any beggar, worthy or unworthy, ever left her door unhelped. Her large-hearted charity showed her relation to HIm 'who maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.' Hers was not the cheap philanthropy which is satisfied with saying, 'Be ye warmed and be ye clothed; depart in peace.' On her tongue was the law of kindness, but it was also in her heart. To the claims of charity and of religion she gave a ready response. The whole community is her debtor, and her epitaph might be that or Dorcas, 'This woman was full of good works and alms-deeds, which she did.' Her devotion as a daughter, a sister, a wife, and a mother was exemplary, for natural affection, was exemplified and purified by grace. The children of your departed friend owe much to a mother's influence and affection, and they may well rise up and call her blessed. The secret of Mrs. Whaley's character is to be found in her devotion to Christ. Born, but a few days before her father's death she was blessed with a devout mother, and grew up in a pious home. When the revival of '59 swept over Ulster she was a girl in her teens, and the impressions she then received were deep and lasting. Often have I heard her repeat or join in singing one of the favourite hymns of that period --\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger\n\nWandering from the fold of God,\n\nHe to rescue me from danger\n\nInterposed His precious blood.\n\nO! to grace, how great a debtor,\n\nDaily I'm constrained to be,\n\nLet Thy love now like a fetter\n\nBind my wandering soul to Thee.\n\nOf her last illness I need only say that it was borne in faith and patience. Kind hands were around her, and kind voices sounded in her ears, but 'truly bar fellowship was with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.' An incident may be mentioned. All her life she had, like all her father's family, been a staunch teetotaler. When her weakened heart required stimulation and spirits were prescribed her action was like that of the Saviour. On the Cross He was offered a deadening drug, 'but when He had tasted thereof He would not drink.' Our sorrow to-day is softened with thanksgiving. The last enemy has been met and overcome. Goodness and mercy, like attendant angels, followed her all her life, and she has passed beyond the shadow and gone to be for ever with the Lord.\"\n\nAt the funeral, which took place on the 30th ult., the remains were brought into the Presbyterian church, where a short service was held, and an appropriate address given by the Rev. A. J. Gillespie, B.A., the minister of the congregation to which the deceased belonged; and prayer at the graveside was offered up by the Rev. R. G. M'Farland, B.A., of Moira.\n\n=========================\n\nSHIPPING DISASTERS\n\nON THE ENGLISH COAST.\n\nMANY LIVES LOST.\n\nFive pilots were drowned on Wednesday in a collision in the Bristol Channel between a Cardiff pilot steamer and, the steamer Star of New Zealand, belonging to the Star Line Co., Belfast.\n\nThe disaster occurred off Nash Point. Whilst the Channel pilot from the Star of New Zealand, outward bound from Cardiff, was being transferred to the W. W. Jones the vessel swung round and collided with the cutter, the shock being so severe that the latter sank in three minutes. Those unfortunate men who were below had no chance whatever to save themselves, and some of those on deck were knocked into the water owing to the fall of the cutter's mast. Others managed to clamber over the chains to the bowsprit of the Star of New Zealand. The men who escaped had scarcely any clothes, having grabbed at any garments in their efforts to save themselves.\n\nThe five men who lost their lives were -- R. England, Cardiff, in charge; George Evans, Plasturton Avenue, Cardiff; W. Wilson, Cardiff; C. White, Cardiff; and G. Foulkes, Penarth, first mate.\n\nSurvivor's Graphic Story.\n\nMr. Nicholas Hixon, second engineer of the sunken pilot cutter, in an interview with the Central News Cardiff correspondent, said that it was his turn down below, and about 10-15 he heard the signal -- a long sharp blast -- for full speed ahead. \"We went full speed towards the Star of New Zealand,\" he said. \"I heard three short blasts, which means full speed astern.\n\n\"Then suddenly there was a cry of 'All hands on deck. Stand by the boats.' It was George Foulkes who shouted. Then the crash came, and the side of the cutter caved in, knocking my hand, and making me drop the pot I was holding. I turned when I heard the cry and ran up the ladder, but fell backwards when I got half-way up. Then I scrambled to the top, jumped on deck, and the captain dragged me along with him.\n\n\"The captain shouted, 'It is too late for the boats.' We made for the steamer's chain and anchors. The chains were all full of men from our cutter, and there did not appear to be enough room. I ran back to the anchor, and then scrambled aboard the Star of New Zealand. \"We were going to try and get others on the cutter aboard, but one of the officers of the Star of New Zealand pulled me back. The two boats were stuck fast at the time. The second officer went to get others, but he failed. Just then the two ships parted, and the funnel of the cutter and its mast turned completely over and went down stern first.\n\n\"At this moment William Wilson, who had scrambled aboard the Star of New Zealand, was knocked into the sea. He described almost a somersault in falling, and we did not see him again. We could see the captain of the cutter, and he called out, 'Give me a rope,' but,\" said Hixon tearfully, \"we could not help him.\"\n\nThe body of Wilson was afterwards picked up by the boats of the Star of New Zealand, which is still cruising round the spot looking for bodies.\n\nTWELVE LIVES LOST.\n\nThe Newcastle-owned steamer Turrethill, of 691 tons, carrying fifteen hands all told, capsized off Southwald, Suffolk, at 2-30 on Wednesday morning, only two men, the captain and the chief engineer, being saved. The Turrethill was proceeding to London with a cargo of coal, and early in the morning the cargo shifted, with the result that the vessel gradually heeled over. Those of the crew who were below hurried on deck, but it was found impossible to reach the captain's little son, who was making the voyage with his father and was asleep in the latter's cabin. The water poured in suddenly, and the steamer turned turtle. All the crew were thrown into the sea. Capt. Thompson was picked up by the Newcastle steamer Wearside, after having been several hours in the water. The chief engineer, Mr. Lewis Evans, swam to and clamoured into a boat that had floated off. He saw some of his comrades disappear, but was powerless to aid them. About five o'clock on Wednesday morning the boat was observed by the Belgian steamer Kremlin, and Mr. Evans, numbed and exhausted, was taken on board. He was later transferred to the Shipwash Lightship, and subsequently the Adleburgh lifeboat put out and conveyed him ashore.\n\nThere was a ground swell and a choppy sea when the water was first discovered in the hold, and the steamer was then about two miles off the land. The names of the crew are given as follow -- Second-engineer, G. Whitehead (married), five children; first and second mates, both named Austin; sailor, named Norten; fireman, named Craig, of South Shields, and Peter Rolson, a Norwegian. Most of toe above were Goole men. The remainder were mostly new hands.\n\n=========================\n\nMASONIC ORPHAN BOYS' SCHOOLS.\n\nDublin, Tuesday. -- The following twelve out of twenty-four candidates have been elected pupils of the Masonic Orphan Boys' School at Clonskeagh --\n\nHugo J.

Tipperary\n\nAt the annual meeting of the County Tipperary Protestant Orphan Society, the Rev. Wm. Pike said he could speak from practical experience of the good work that the society was doing. In happy terms, he referred to the fact that that was the fiftieth anniversary of Mr. Tinsley's connection with the Tipperary Orphan Society. That was the fiftieth meeting organised by Mr. Tinsley, and he (the speaker) hoped that Mr. Tinsley would be spared to them for many years to come. He (Mr. Pike) supported that society first, because he was an Churchman, and secondly, because he was an Irishman. The Census of the small parish of Clonoulty, of which he was rector, was taken in 1826 by a Mr. Fitzgerald -- a very able and intelligent Roman Catholic schoolmaster in the parish. He (Mr. Pike) had the privilege of being shown the shown the book in which the Census was written up. The total population of the parish was then close on 6,000, and the Protestant population eighty-three. At the last Census the total population was about 1,700 -- less than one-third of what it was eighty-eighty [sic] years ago. That made sad reading. At the same time, the Protestant population was eighty-five instead of eighty-three, as it was in 1826. That their numbers had remained the same was to a great extent due to that society. Of his present congregation twenty would not be there but for the Protestant Orphan Society. Other parishes had benefited in the same way. In some places they could not keep their schools open but for the society, and, that being so, they, as Churchmen and as Irishmen, were bound to support them in every possible way. (Hear, hear.)\n\n=========================\n\nDUKE OF ARGYLL'S FUNERAL.\n\nOn Wednesday the remains of the late Duke of Argyll were conveyed to Roseneath, and placed in the parish church, there to remain until the interment, which will be in the family burial-place at Kilmun on Friday. The body arrived by special train at Craigendoran, whence it was borne by the sergeants of the Glasgow Highlanders to the steamer Marion for conveyance to Roseneath. There travelled by the steamer Princess Louise, the new Duke, detachments of the local military, Boy Scouts, Highland officers, and a pipe band. At Roseneath it was met by the estate workers and tenants. Full honours were paid to the illustrious dead, and a lengthy cortege followed the remains to the church.\n\n^ top of page\n\nThe Witness - Friday, 22 May, 1914\n\nBirth\n\nHOBSON -- May 11, 1914, at Drumduff, Benburb, the wife of John Hobson -- a son.\n\nDeaths\n\nCROMIE -- May 20, 1914, at his father's residence, 40 Upper Newtownards Road, Reuben, youngest and dearly-beloved son of Alexander and Agnes Cromie.

The bridesmaids wore pretty dresses of ivory satin, gracefully draped with chiffon, and instead of hats they wore tulle veils and green wreaths. The bridegroom gave the bridesmaids green enamel brooches. Captain Wreford Brown, D.S.O., Northumberland Fusiliers, acted as best man. Only relatives and a few intimate friends attended the reception after ceremony at the Hyde Park Hotel, Captain and Mrs. Sinclair leaving later in the day for the New Forest. The bride travelled in a grey crepe meteor dress and a grey hat to match, trimmed with pink rose.\n\n^ top of page\n\nThe Witness - Friday, 29 May, 1914\n\nBirth\n\nPARKE -- May 20, 1914, at Crossmoyle House, Clones, the wife of W.

All whom I have heard speak of that lecture are agreed that it is the best piece of historical research which we have had for a long time. It is also a work that needed to be done, for it has cleared away much of the rubbish that had gathered round the Ulster Scot question. Professor Heron's lecture should certainly be issued in pamphlet form, either by himself or by the Historical Society, and it is to induce publication that I write this letter. -- Yours, &c.,\n\nMay 26th, 1914. A. B. C\n\n=========================\n\nDEATH OF AN ELDER.\n\nRev. Robert Davey reported the death on 5th March last of Mr. Thomas Scott, who had been for thirty-six years a member of session in Dunmurry. He had been for over fifty years the superintendent of the Sabbath-school, and he thought he had never been absent, except twice, and he was never late. He took an active part in all the work of the congregation.\n\n=========================\n\nDEATH OF SIR F. F. BELSEY.\n\nA Well-Known Sunday School Worker\n\nThe announcement of the death of Sir Francis F. Belsey, J.P., chairman of the council of the Sunday-school Union, at the age of 76, will be generally regretted. It will be within the recollection of our readers that Sir Francis was knighted by the late King Edward on account of his work on behalf of the Sunday-schools of the world. \"My first acquaintance with Sir Francis, then Mr. Belsey,\" writes a fellow-worker, \"was one morning many years ago, when travelling, by an early train to London. I heard a friend say, 'Good morning, Mr. Belsey, and thank you for coming,' shortly after 6 a.m. at Wigan. On making myself known as an I.B.-R.A. worker, Mr. Belsey said, 'Delighted to meet you,' and ever since the friend from Ireland had a most cordial reception in London and elsewhere by our esteemed friend.\" Sir Francis was a very busy man, besides superintending a Sunday-school, he wrote a lesson for the \"Sunday-school Chronicle\" every week, and is well known as the \"Man at the Desk.\" He knew how to utilise his time, as, after conversing for some time that morning in the train, he took up the study of the lesson, even when journeying to London. As chairman of the Sunday-school Union, he made all the delegates at home, and his deep sympathy for the work and the workers has been manifested throughout the Sunday-school world.\n\nA telegram was sent from the Irish readers of the I.B.-R.A., tendering to Lady Belsey and family sincere sympathy in their bereavement. We feel quite certain that all our readers who are interested in the welfare of the young will not only sympathise with the family, but also with the British Sunday-school Union in the loss of so prominent a worker in the Sunday-school world.\n\nThe following telegram was sent from Ulster District I.B.-R.A. -- \"Lady Belsey, Russell Square, London -- Irish readers tender to Lady Belsey and family sincere sympathy in her bereavement -- Moore, I.B.-R.A. [?] Bangor, Down.\"\n\n=========================\n\nTIMELY RESCUE IN CORK HARBOUR\n\nOn Sunday morning last, as the Rev. Vistor J. Cotter, chaplain to the Presbyterian troops at Queenstown, and Rev. Bertram Moran were returning in an Army Service boat to Queenstown from one of the forts, where they had been conducting Divine service, they observed a man in the water in a dangerous position. He belonged to a yacht which was leaving the harbour for Kinsale. He had been pitched overboard, and as there was only one other man on board, who was therefore unable to leave the helm, his situation was one of great peril. The two clergymen drew the attention of the men in charge of their boat to the incident and urged them to proceed at once to the rescue. By dint of hard pulling the yachtsman was reached in time just as he was on the point of collapsing. He was lifted into the yacht, and measures were taken for his restoration and comfort.\n\n=========================\n\nDEATH OF DR. HARRY CHESTNUT, TRALEE.\n\nWe regret to announce the death of Dr. Harry Chestnut, of Tralee. The sad event occurred on Thursday afternoon, the 21st inst. at the South Infirmary, Cork. Three weeks before he contracted blood-poisoning while in attendance upon one of his patients, and, immediately recognising his danger, at once used all available remedies. On the next day he went to the Cork Infirmary, where, notwithstanding all that the best medical skill could do, he passed peacefully away. Dr. Chestnut was born at The Manse, Tralee, on the 22nd of September, 1868. He was the son of the Rev. William W. Chestnut, who from 1843 till 1888 was minister of the Tralee Presbyterian Church. Soon after the completion of his college courses, Dr. Chestnut began the medical practice which he carried on for twenty years amid the ever-growing confidence of a very wide district of County Kerry. To the poor he was not merely a doctor, but a well-beloved friend, and by no class is his death more deeply lamented or his loss more profoundly felt.\n\nThe funeral took place on Saturday, the 23rd. The chief mourners were -- James A. Chestnut, Bank of Ireland, Londonderry (brother); John Campbell, M.D., Belfast, and Rev. Robert Henderson, India (brothers-in-law); George Johnston, Ballygarron (cousin); Mrs. Campbell, Mrs. Henderson, and the Misses Chestnut, (sisters); Mrs. Bremner and Miss Johnston (cousins). The Rev. Charles O'Sullivan, P.P., and as many of his priests as could attend, together with all the Protestant ministers, joined the cortege. The burial services were conducted by the Rev. J. R. Bartley, assisted by the Rev. Chanceller Foley and the Rev. Mr. Coade. Mr. Bartley, in his address, gave appropriate impressions to the feelings of the whole community regarding their beloved physician who had laid down his life for them. On the coffin plate were engraved the words \"Faithful unto death\" -- words which not only truly described Dr. Chestnut's life, but also truly described the manner of his death. His life was faithfulness: and his death was the last heroic act of a faithful life.\n\nDr. Chestnut had all his life been a devoted member of the Tralee Presbyterian Church, and on Sabbath, the 23rd;, the morning service conducted by the Rev. J. R. Bartley had special reference to his decease. The text of the sermon was, \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.\" Mr. Bartley pointed out that the very noblest characteristic of the Christian life is faithfulness, in that which is least as well as in that which is great; that upon the faithfulness of Christ in giving His life for sinners their whole salvation depends; that every Christian shows likest Christ when, at all costs, he is faithful to his Lord and his duty; and that Dr. Chestnut's death came as a real example of that kind of faithfulness which our Lord would have us show. The deep and universal sympathy so strikingly manifested on all sides will be a rich possession to the sorrowing friends, and will, by God's blessing, help them to bear the heavy burden of bereavement.\n\n^ top of page"
