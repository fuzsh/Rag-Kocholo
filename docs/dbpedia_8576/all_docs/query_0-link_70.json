        "text": "Although 1839 is commonly accepted as the first running of the Grand National Steeplechase, with Lottery as the first winner, the first race recognizable as the Grand National was run at Aintree on 29 February 1836. *1843: Race, originally run at level weights, becomes a handicap race\n\n**1916: The Racecourse Association Steeplechase run at Gatwick over the Grand National distance\n\n**1917-18: The War National Steeplechase run at Gatwick over the Grand National distance\n\n****This horse traces to the half-bred Lady Madcap Family, not noted in the Family Tables. The earliest traceable mare in this family is The Kitten of unknown parentage, dam of Little Agnes (ch. f. 1876) by Delight\n\nThe notation \"hb\" indicates the horse was considered a \"Half-bred\"--somewhere in its lineage a horse not entered in the General Stud Book appeared. Some half-bred female families were traced, recorded and subsequently designated with a \"B\" before a number. See Half-Bred Foundation Mares for more information. In some cases, the horse's dam or her lineage was traced, but not assigned a number, and in some cases the dam or lineage simply is not now known."
