Charles Burton Buckley. Kuala Lumpur, University of Malaya Press, 1965. p. 373 Captain George Julius Dare was a well known Singaporean. He had been a navigating officer, in those days called the master in the Navy, and married at the Cape when on the Station. His grandfather, Mr. Julius, then helped him to build a vessel of his own, and he afterwards built others, trading out to China with three different vessels of his own. In this year he was passing through Singapore, on his way from Bombay to China, and left his wife on shore at a boarding house kept by Mrs. Clarke at the south west corner of North Bridge road and Middle Road, where the baby Julius, who has been mentioned, was born. About two months afterwards Mrs. Dare left in the unfortunate Viscount Melbourne for Macao, with the two children, to join her husband there. Captain Dare sold his vessel for a very handsome price, remitting home the money at the exchange of about six shillings to a dollar! In 1845 he went home, and returned and settled down in Singapore in February 1848. These particulars are found in the evidence he gave in favour of Sir James Brooke, on the famous enquiry related under the year 1854. He commenced business in Singapore as a shipchandler and commission agent in the Square. There were then four shipchandlers' firms, namely, W.S. Duncan, John Steel & Co., Whampoa & Co., and Mr. Dare . . . . . In 1855 Mr. Dare went to England, leaving a man in charge, whose name there is no necessity to mention. He was a very plausible man, with a particularly pleasant manner, but he turned out untrustworthy and ruined the business, as well as his employer. Mr. Dare died in London, 50 years of age in 1856. He had a family of nine children, one of his daughters married Mr. William Ramsay Scott; another Captain C.J. Bolton, very well known and a great favourite in Singapore, who commanded Jardine Matheson & Co.'s crack opium schooner, and when steam came, the Glenartney. He is now living in Essex. Another daughter was married to Mr. Whitworth Allen who was in Singapore and Penang for many years, now retired from business.

DARE OF SINGAPORE. 1841\n\nIn the autumn of 1841, Sarah Strieve Dare was decidedly pregnant and while staying at a boarding house kept by \"Mrs. Clarke at the south west corner of North Bridge Road and Middle Road\" gave birth to her second son, John Julius Dare (later known as \"Julius\"). About two months after his birth, she sailed on the Viscount Melbourne - young children in tow - to join her husband in Macao.\n\nThe ship that she and her two first-borne children were travelling on, the Vincent Melbourne had left Singapore for Macao on a Saturday, 25th December 1841. Four days later they were shipwrecked on the Luconia shoal off Brunei in Borneo. The passengers and crew left their crippled ship in five boats.\n\nThe lifeboat, which ferried Sarah and her two children to supposed safety, also had fourteen Europeans and thirteen natives and servants on board. Likely not included in count of the Europeans would be baby Julius, a couple of months old, and his older brother, George, barely two years old. Singapore was 600 miles away. We can assume rain because the following recorded story refers to the powder for the guns being too damp to fire. One would assume that travelling this distance in \"the boats\" with two infants would be frightening enough, but worse was to come. A junior officer of the Viscount Melbourne recorded the subsequent events in great detail:\n\nAbout six a.m. as we were all assembled in the launch, hearing the captain read prayers, we saw a proa bearing down towards us. The captain ordered us to take the serang (boatswain over the lascars), along with us and speak to them, to learn if they were friendly; for we much feared they were pirates. If there was danger, we were to hoist a signal, and they would come to our assistance.\n\nWe accordingly started to meet them; we waved a white cloth as a token of amity, and they did the same. When we got alongside of them we spoke, the serang acting as interpreter; and they said that they came to conduct us safely in-shore, and that one boat was there already. So, by this we suspected that they had taken them prisoners, and wished to entice the rest of us to the same fate. They now said that they wished to see the captain; so we pulled back, and they soon came up with the launch, where all were ready, cutlass in hand, to receive them, in case of treachery.\n\nThey tried all they could to persuade us to go with them, and finally began to make fast to the launch with a rattan rope. When they found that we would not go with them, they assumed a very threatening aspect; so there being so few of us who could fight, and our firearms being useless on account of the preceding rain, the captain gave the order to cut and run. The cook with one blow of his cutlass severed their rope, and we all made sail.\n\nWhen they saw this, they made sail in chase of us. We gained upon them at first, when to our surprise, they opened fire on us, first from their rifles, and finally from a swivel, the last shot passing through a blanket that was rigged as a screen from the sun at the back of the captain and passengers. It passed betwixt the captain and Mrs. Dare, and then scraping a piece off the skull of one of the lascars, who sat in the bow of the boat, it buried itself in the water. Another shot, cut away the leech of the second cutter's lug.\n\nThey gained rapidly on our boat, we not being so well manned or skilful as the rest. When within a few fathoms they made signs for us to desist pulling, at the same time taking aim at us. Mr. Parkhouse, who was pulling the next oar to me, when he saw the rifle pointed towards us, dropped his oar, exclaiming, \"Good God! There is one of us gone.\" It was of no use persisting further, so they ran alongside.\n\nThe proa was about the size of a sloop, neatly built of teak, but cleverly covered with matting and bark, to make her appearance as lubberly and clumsy as possible. She had two long straight poles for masts, and a large lug made of matting to each. Besides this, they pulled fifteen sweeps a side.\n\nWhen they first ran alongside the launch, there appeared to be only five or six half-naked fellows, who were fishing; but now her decks were crowded with Malays, armed and dressed in fancy costumes. Krises, very dangerous, crooked poisoned swords, clubs, spears and guns, altogether made them have a very ferocious appearance. They jumped into our boat; seized upon us; and would, I think, have dispatched us at once, had it not been for the interference of one who seemed to be their chief, who dashing away the swords of the most forward, ordered all but two to get into their own craft and to proceed in chase of our other boats, which by this time had got pretty far in advance.\n\nThey accordingly set their sails, and stood for the other boats, whilst we were obliged to steer for the land. Our preserver, a gentlemanly thief, was still with us, and he now began to lay his hands upon all our things, tying them all up in a blanket. But when those in the proa saw this, they, thinking, I suppose, that they were being sent after a shadow, whilst he was making sure of the substance, turned back, and running along-side, began to clear the boat of everything - clothes, provisions, and even our drop of water, about two gallons, for the sake of the keg. As they took our muskets, pistols and other arms, they repeatedly, jumped for joy, exclaiming \"bagus\" (very good).\n\nWhen they came to our sextant, they seemed very much puzzled to know what it was, and made signs to me to show them the use of it, which I did. We repeatedly made signs to the chief to let us go after the boats, which by this time were nearly our of sight; to which he nodded his head assentingly, and shook us by the hand. Mr. Parkhouse now very foolishly pulled a small bag from his pocket, containing a fifty rupee note and some silver, which he gave to the chief, at the same time as pointing to our other boats. Directly he got this, the rest began to strip us for more.\n\nThey took his watch, Mr. Dainty's watch and ring, but on me they only found a Dutch silver piece. There was a case of herring paste, which they made me taste before they would take it. They also threw our bag of biscuit into the water. When having taken everything, they now, to our great delight, told us we might go. They gave us a small basket of sago, and about three pints of water.\n\nAt this point, I stop to imagine the mix of fear and rage that I would feel to be left with an infant and toddler and only three pints of water on an open boat - water which would also have to meet the needs of twenty-seven adults.\n\nThe chief politely shook hands with us all; then stepping on board the proa they made sail towards the shore. Luckily for us, one of our boats was just in sight, that containing Mr. Penfold, who had offered the captain, if he would give him six Englishmen, he would rescue us, or share our fate, for they never thought we should return. Guess then our joy, when we saw him lying-to, though a great way off. We made sail, and stood towards him, pulling at the same time with all our might, uncertain for some time whether we gained upon them or not. Had it been night, we should have missed them, and must, unprovided as we were, have died a miserable death; worse, indeed, than the one from which we had escaped.\n\nWe came up with him fast, and in two hours after leaving the proa, ran alongside of them, and pleased enough they were to see us. Just as we reached them, away went our mast, and the cutter took us in tow. We soon came up with the launch, when the captain welcomed us heartily. Our boat not being worth repairing was condemned. Half of our crew went in the second cutter. Mr. Dainty and myself into the launch. The sails and oars being taken out of her, she was scuttled, and cast adrift.\n\nWe arrived at Singapore at about three p.m., after being twelve days in our boats. The second cutter had got in early in the morning. The first cutter did not get into Singapore until a fortnight after we left, having been to Sambas. The lascars, who deserted us, had been taken as slaves, and did not regain their liberty until twelve months after.\n\nOn January 17th, a boat was seen coming into Singapore River to Mr. Johnston's landing steps at Tanjjong Tangkap. Dr. Little and Mr. Read saw the boat coming up to the steps and the former helped Sarah Dare ashore with her two boys, George and Julius. They had been thirteen days in the open boat at sea with few provisions and had lived to tell. Sarah would go on to give birth to seven more live children, one of whom would become the wife of Sir Thomas JACKSON.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nBuckley, Charles Burton.

GEORGE QUILTER,\n\nBeing an extract from a local paper.\n\nThe departure of one of the oldest and most deservedly respected of the clergy of the Diocese of Lincoln, the Rev. George Quilter, Prebendary of Lincoln and Vicar of Canwick, from the scene of his labour, carried on for more than half-a-century, calls for a brief notice.\n\nHaving taken his degree at Peterhouse in 1815, the same, year as Dean Wadington, of Durham, and Dr. Archdall, the recently deceased Master of Emmanuel, Mr. Quilter was ordained by Bishop Sparke of Ely, and in 1818 was appointed by the Mercer's Company to the living of Canwick. It is an interesting fact that one of the candidates for the living was the Rev. Richard Sibthorp (whose vacillations between the Churches of England and Rome form such a curious page in the religious history of the last quarter of a century ), whose brother, the once famous Colonel Sibthorp, M.P., was the owner of Canwick Hall.\n\nA fast friendship soon arose between the successful and disappointed competitors, which no change of faith could impair, and one of those who walked nearest to his old friends coffin at the funeral was the Rev. Richard Sibthorp, Roman Catholic Priest, of Nottingham.\n\nMr. Quilter was one of the assiduous workers who, without attempting great things, by the singleness of their aim, utter self-forgetfulness, and unvarying Christian love, effect more for Christ and His Church than many whose names are far more widely known. It has been often said of him that \"he worked before it was the fashion to work,\" and gave an example of the laborious, affectionate, Christian pastor, when perhaps such were rarer than they now are.\n\nFor some years Mr. Quilter took pupils, among whom was Admiral Eden. His village lying on the brow of the hill overlooking Lincoln, within a short walk of that city, he was enabled to devote his spare time to good works among its inhabitants. The dispensary numbered him among its founders and to the last he was one of its most active managers. The workhouse and hospital benefited by his gratuitous ministrations to their poor and suffering inmates. Never, indeed, was there a call of duty or charity which was not heeded, and, as far as possible, obeyed by Mr. Quilter. Almost his last act was to send a cheque towards the restoration of St. Mary's Church in Lincoln.\n\nLast year Mr. Quilter received a well merited recognition of his labours from the Bishop of Lincoln, in the appointment to a Prebendal Stall in the Cathedral. He loved the Minster, and rejoiced to attend its services as a devout worshipper, and it is pleasant to feel that, for the last year of his life, he could do so as a member of its foundation.\n\nMr. Quilter's death was what one could have wished for him: a sudden easy passage to the other world, not preceded by sickness or accompanied by pain. On the morning of Wednesday, the 15th inst., he was on his way to family prayer, when he fell, and in a moment his spirit had joined the blest in Paradise.\n\nSint nostrae animae cum illo. His body was interred on Tuesday, the 21st, beneath the ivied walls of his little church, a large number of the clergy and leading laity of the city testifying their respect by their attendance. The service at the grave was read by Mr Quilter's old friend, the Rev. Edward Wilson, formerly Fellow of St John's Vicar of Nocton, and Prebendary of Lincoln. The pall was borne by Chancellor Massingberd, Precentor Variables, Prebendary Blenkin, Rev. T. S. Nelson (Rural Dean), etc. Great Tom was tolled from the Cathedral tower during the ceremony, and at Evensong Spohr's anthem, Blest are the Departed,\" was sung by the Cathedral choir, and the Dead March in Samson played.\n\nSir Francis Hill writes - George Quilter was deeply involved with the Lincoln branch of the British & Foreign Bible Society, formed in 1816, this was the first clear expression of the evanagelical movement in Lincoln. It received support within the lay members of Lincoln society, including the Sibthorp family of Canwick, a few country clergymen lent their support, including Mr Quilter of Canwick - most of the clergy however, and in particular the cathedral clergy, kept aloof from the movement. Mr George Quilter, the rector of Canwick, together with Mr Bergne, the Independent minister, launched the Lincoln Temperence Society in 1833.\n\nRef: Georgian Lincoln and Victorian Lincoln by Sir Francis Hill (published by Cambridge Univ. Press 1966 & 1974 respectively)\n\nThe Lincolnshire Chronicle of 17 November, deaths column: Quilter, on the 15th November, at Conwick, suddenly, the Rev. George Quilter Prebendary of Lincoln Catherdral and Vicar of Canwick, aged 78.\n\nAlso reported: \"We announce with extreme regret that the Rev G. Quilter, vicar of Canwiok, we believe for a long period of 54 years, died on Wednesday morning last. The deceased gentleman was appointed to the prebendal stall of St Mary, Crackpool during the past year, and few appointments have given more satisfaction.Mr Quilter was highly respected by all to whom he was known, and was a liberal benefactor to the City charities, especially to the Dispensary, in which institution he took a very great interest.Mr Quilter died somewhat suddenly, for on Tuesday last he was in Lincoln, apparently in good health\".\n\nThe Lincolnshire Chronicle of 24 November 1871 writes:\n\n\"The funeral of the justly respected Prebendary Quilter took place on Wednesday last at 12 o'clock. He was buried where he had lived, in the midst of his people, whom he had tendered with fatherly care for more than half a century - beneath the walls of the church in which he had fed his flock with the word of life, led their devotions, and imparted to them the blessed sacraments of Christ.\n\nThe funeral was as largely attended as was to be expected from the\n\nuniversal esteem and affection entertained for Mr Quilter in Lincoln and its neighbourhood. The church was filled with his parishioners, and an omnibus conveyed to the service the aged inmates of St Annes Bede Houses, of which institution the reverend gentleman was one of the oldest trustees.The pall was borne by the following clergymen, robed in surplices, hood and stole: the precentor, the chancellor, the Revs T.S Nelson, G.B. Blenkir, F.B. Bleokir, and W.T Hathway. Among the clergy present, who wore surplices, were the Revs (and here it lists 11 persons, one of them being Richard Sibthorp of Nottingham). Among the laity we may mention the Hon. A.L. Melville,\n\nConingsby Sibtborp esq., F. Burton esq., Messrs W. Ashley, J. Norton, R. Trotter, and Dr G.M. Lowe. The coffin was preceded by the surpliced clergy, who were immediately followed by Dr George Lowe and the Rev. Richard Sibthorp, the old and beloved friend of the deceased. The introductory sentences and the service at the grave were read by the Rev. E Wilson of Nocton, and the psalms and lessons by the curate of Canwick, the Rev. Haskett-Smith. The venerable of Mr Quilter supported bv her son the Rev. Frederick Quilter, and others of her sons and daughters, followed the remains of her husband to the grave.\n\nIn additon to those above enumerated, we observed amongst the crowd that surrounded the grave the faces of many with whom the late vicar had been associated in deeds of trust, benevolence, or charity, and to whom he had been, as he always was to all who came personally in contact with him, a gentleman, minister, and true friend. Last Sunday afternoon the Dead March was played after service in the Minister, and on Wednesday afternoon Spoirs beautiful anthem, 'Blest are the departed' was sung as a tribute of respect to Prebendary Quilters memory.\"\n\nAfter the death of the Rev. George Quilter. his son, the Rev. Frederick Wm Quilter was put forward to the Mercers Company, the patron, to take over the incumbency.\n\nA petition to this effect was signed by every person in the parish and submitted to the Mercers' Company. At that time the Rev. Frederick Quilter was the vicar of Leyton Essex. However, despite the pressure from the local community, the Mercers Company, voted in a mercer, the Rev. James Watney, of the famous beer family.\n\nThe Lincolnshire Chronicle of 1 December 1871 reports that a resolution was passed at an ordinary monthly meeting of the Committee of the Lincoln General Dispensary, as follows. \"that this Board cannot allow the lamented death of the Rev Prebendary George Quilter to pass by without tendering to his widow and family the acknowledgment of Mr Quilter's very long and valuable services, rendered by him to this institution for a period of upwards of 15 years, and expressing their sympathy with them in this their domestic trial.\"\n\nResearch Notes:\n\nBaptism IGI FHL Films 0568853, 0579288, 6903837.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n1.

No 3.\n\nGEORGE CHARLES JULIUS. 1804-1885.\n\nReminiscences by Florence Stevens.\n\nGeorge was born in India in 1804. His parents soon afterwards returned to England, and settled at the Old Palace, Richmond, and George was brought up to the medical profession. He began practice with his father, but not for very long, and on his marriage, in 1829, to the beautiful Miss Spaight1, he went to live in Ireland. His wife died in 1840, and leaving a daughter, Ethel, to be brought up by her grandmother, Mrs. Spaight, at the Hermitage, Castle Connel, co. Limerick, he went to live with his three boys at Wakefield, in Yorkshire, and sent them to a day school.\n\nIn 1844 he married Susan Thorley, the only child of a wealthy old friend in Richmond ; she died left him with another baby girl, Ella, who became the charge of his niece, Julia Quilter. Dr. Julius was very unhappy, and buried himself in the wilds of Ireland, with his three boys.\n\nWhilst on a visit to Mr. Spaight, at the Hermitage, the house was nearly burnt down, and his boys had a narrow escape ; the bed in which two of them were sleeping was in flames, and Dr. Julius was only just in time to rescue them. He has shown me part of the charred bed hanging, handsomely worked by hand, which he always kept.\n\nVery early in life his son Reginald went to seek his fortune in New Zealand, whilst Herbert and Edric practiced as solicitors in Maidstone, and at Holt, in Norfolk. After a time they joined their brother in New Zealand, and Dr. Julius settled at Washfield, in Devonshire, with his brother William, a retired major, and his niece, Julia Quilter, and her charge, Ella. He spent some happy years in beautiful scenery, for which he had a painter's appreciation, doctoring the poor people, by whom he was much loved.\n\nLater on he spent two years at Willey Mill, at Wrecclesham, with Ella, and then took a little house near Brecon, in South Wales, a very beautiful part of the country, moving later into Peterstone Court. Whilst here he entered into and thoroughly enjoyed county society, for which he was eminently fitted, and also spent much time in fishing.\n\nDuring a visit with her father to his, sister at St. Leonards, Ella contracted typhoid fever, which developed on a visit to Wrecclesharn, and of which she died at the age of 25.\n\nThis was a sad blow and lifelong sorrow to her father. He left Wales, and after a time settled at Seale, near Farnham, where later on his son Edric, now an invalid, and his widowed daughter-in-law, Mrs. Reginald Julius (Catherine Cameron), and her three children joined him, and remained with him to the end of his life.\n\nHe died at Tilford, near Farnham, in 1885, aged 81, and was buried in that pretty churchyard by the side of his brother, Mavor Julius, and his niece, Julia Quilter. He was a fine,looking man, about 6ft, 2in. in height., fond of art, music, and painting, a, fascinating talker, fond of society, and yet shrinking from it, a reader of every kind of literature, a good classic scholar, and also a lover of Nature. Fishing was his favourite pastime. He was not a successful man, and perhaps this made him rather morbid. He was very kind-hearted, and greatly loved by the poor wherever he lived.\n\nHe was a very able man, and would probably have done well in his profession if only he had kept to it.\n\n1.

After his retirement Dr Frederick usually spent the winter months travelling in the Mediterranean region, visiting on different occasions the Azores, Spain, Italy, Corsica, Algiers, Egypt, Palestine and Constantinople. Finally he 'fixed his abode upon Richmond Green', where he died from inflammation of the lungs, in his 75th year, after a very few days illness. He was buried in the Richmond Cemetery, thus ending a family association with that village which had lasted three quarters of a century.\n\nJulius Jottings, January 1901. No 4.\n\nNotes from various contributors.\n\nHe practiced for a few years at Bognor, where his eldest sister, Emily, kept house for him. He then fell to bad health, and had to travel abroad. On his return he went into partnership with his father Dr George C Julius snr. (note he was apprenticed as an Apothecary in 1827) He lived most of his life in the Old Palace, Richmond, but retired from practice when about 60 years and travelled extensively.\n\nRecollections from Mrs Florence Stevens:\n\nHe was a fine looking man, about 5' 11 \", with fair complexion, blue eyes and a long white beard. He was very witty, clever, and amusing; very sarcastic and alarming to those who did not know him very well; but very kind and gentle in sickness.\n\nTwo of his daughters, Anne Ellen and Katherine Pauline married doctors. Dr. William Bateman and Dr. Edward Fenn respectively. These two doctors carried on their father-in- laws practice in Richmond until 1912, when the practice, which had been in the hands of the JULIUS FAMILY since it was first established by Dr. George Charles Julius in 1814, 98 years before, passed into other hands.\n\nRichmond Census 1841: Frederick Julius, 30yrs, Surgeon.
