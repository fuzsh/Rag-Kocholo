        "text": "The surname McCloy is believed to belong to that branch of the Stewart clan known as Stewart of Bute and our McCloy ancestors may well have emigrated from Scotland to the coast of County Antrim in the 17th century. The 1669 Hearth Money Roll for the parish of Carncastle, County Antrim, includes a John McCloye. Knowledge of our own family begins Robert McCloy and his three sons, John, Alexander and William McCloy who lived in South Munie, Glenarm, County Antrim in the late 18th century.\n\nSome of the information on the McCloy family was provided by Rev. George Jackson of the Glenarm Presbyterian Church in 1959. Another substantial fraction was gleaned from the exhaustive work of Felix McKillop and taken from his comphrehensive history of the Glenarm area entitled \"Townlands, People and Traditions (2006)\".\n\nMap of Glenarm area showing some of the places occuring in the story of the McCloy family.\n\nRobert McCloy was probably the father of the three McCloy brothers listed below. Born about 1720, he was a farmer in Lisnahay, Cairncastle, to whom William, Earl of Antrim, granted a lease on 12 acres, 2 roods and 16 perches of land in Lisnahay (as well as the adjoining hills) on Jan.19, 1779 [PRONI D2977/3A/4/85/5]. Robert married Rebecca Ann Martin born about 1720 and they were probably the parents of:\n\nJohn McCloy (1743-1806) was born in 1743 and, along with his brother William, was granted a counterpart lease on 9 acres, 3 roods and 11 perches of land in Lisnahay by Randal, Earl of Antrim, on Feb.19, 1784 [PRONI D2977/3A/4/85/8B]. John was a contractor for the repair of roads (in County Antrim, presumably near Glenarm) at Lent 1785, in August 1787, in 1793 (with brother William) and, with brothers Alexander and William, from 1796 until 1800. Along with his brother Alexander, on Jun.1, 1787, he was granted a lease on two acres in South Munie from Francis McNaughton, the local landowner. In the summer of 1789 he was a High Constable in County Antrim and was paid 6 pounds, 7 shillings and nine pence for collecting the public money. John of South Munie, Glenarm, is also listed among the 40 shilling freeholders in a 1790 County Antrim election. He and his brother Alexander voted for Leslie and McNaughten who were said to represent the aristocratic power in the county. John O'Neill and Hercules Rowley were elected. There is an old gravestone which once stood in the old Glenarm graveyard at Glebe but in the 1950s was located in the barn of John Davison's farm at Drumcrow, Carnalbanagh and probably refers to John McCloy: Here lieth the body of John McCloy who depd. this life Febry....1806 (or 1800) aged 63 yrs.\n\nAlexander McCloy was born in 1745. He was a sub-constable under the County Antrim Grand Jury in the summer of 1786 and received 2 pounds as half-a- year's salary. Along with his brother John, on Jun.1, 1787, he was granted a lease on two acres in South Munie from Francis MacNaughton, the local landowner. Alexander also leased a farm in Deerpark West. He was also a contractor for the repair of county roads from 1796 to 1815. Alexander of South Munie, Glenarm, like his brother John is listed among the 40 shilling freeholders in a 1790 County Antrim election (see above). Alexander died about 1813. His wife may have been Mary and they had at least three children:\n\nSamuel McCloy was baptized on Jun.3, 1788.\n\nGeorge McCloy was baptized on May 3, 1789.\n\nMargaret McCloy was baptized on Apr.19, 1791.\n\nWilliam McCloy (1746-1813) was a born in Carncastle, County Antrim, in 1746. Along with his brother John, William was granted a counterpart lease on 9 acres, 3 roods and 11 perches of land in Lisnahay by Randal, Earl of Antrim, on Feb.19, 1784 [PRONI D2977/3A/4/85/8B]. William was High Constable in County Antrim in April 1791 and was paid 6 pounds, 4 shillings and 4 pence for collecting the public money. He was therefore a yeoman stationed at Glenarm Castle in the years leading up to the 1798 Rebellion. Those sympathetic to the rebel cause in the Glenarm area assembled on Bellair Hill and marched down past William's house in Munie towards the village. Fearing for their lives, William's wife Marjery and the children hid under a holly bush in a field near their house. As the rebels passed they found the family in their hiding place but the leader told them to go home and no one would harm them. Then, led by a Mr. McAllister of Mullaghsandal a group of rebels attacked Glenarm Castle but William McCloy and the other yeoman repulsed them after a scuffle. In the aftermath of the rebellion, McAllister and his friends were arrested and sentenced to be lashed. However, when the verdict was announced a petition for a reprieve was circulated and was signed by William McCloy among others. As a result a reprieve was granted and the rebels were forever grateful. In more peaceful times, William was also a contractor for the repair of county roads in 1793 and from 1796 until 1820(?). In 1778 he married Margery McGavock, born in Glenarm in 1757. He was a pastmaster of the Cairncastle Masonic Lodge in 1809. William died on Nov.10, 1813. Margery lived much longer and along with her son Daniel she is included as \"Widow McCloy\" in the 1832 Tithe Applotment Records for Lower Munie, Parish of Tickmacrevan. Margery died in Glenarm on March 26, 1860, at the age of 103. She and William are remembered on a memorial stone in the Old Church at Glebe, Glenarm, County Antrim (not the present church) which reads: ``Erected to the memory of William McCloy who departed this life on 10th Nov., 1813, aged 67 years. Also his son Robert McCloy who departed this life on 18th Dec., 1820, aged 33. Also his daughter Mary McCloy who departed this life on 5th April, 1822, aged 28(?). Also his son Samuel who departed this life on 14th July, 1835, aged -- and his son John who departed this life 22nd(?) June, 1848, aged 37 years and his wife Margery McCloy who departed this life 26th March, 1860, aged 103 and Jane McCloy who departed this life 19th Dec., 1861, aged 70 years. Also his daughter .....''. [The stone has been fractured, cemented and partly defaced.] William and Margery McCloy had at least ten children who are listed below.\n\nCHILDREN OF WILLIAM (BORN 1746) AND MARGERY McCLOY:\n\nThe children of William and Margery McCloy:\n\nAlexander McCloy was born in 1779 in Glenarm and joined the British Navy. He sailed on a British man-of-war for 21 years and fought at the Battle of Trafalgar under Admiral Nelson. While in the Navy he married Margaret Kain (or Kane) who was born in 1792, the daughter of Guy Kain and his wife (maiden name Hunter). Alexander and Margaret had three children, Archibald, Ellen and Jean. Alexander lived in Kanestown, perhaps after he left the Navy. He died on Dec.1, 1831, at the age of 52. His gravestone in Glenarm graveyard is next to an Earls family stone and reads: ``Erected in memory of Alexander McCloy of Kanestown who departed this life 1st December 1831 aged 52 years.'' After Alexander's death Margaret took in fine embroidery to keep the family going until her son Archibald became established in Stanley Township, Huron County, Ontario, Canada. She then travelled with the rest of the family to join Archibald. She died in Fairgrove, Michigan in 1878 at the age of 84.\n\nArchibald McCloy was born on May 15, 1820, in County Antrim. About 1842 at the age of 22 he left for America. Landing at Ottawa he spent a year working on a farm for twelve dollars a month after which he started to travel up the Ottawa river. He finally reached a lumber camp but after one night spent in the company of men who spoke only French, he left and went to Goderich, Ontario on the shores of Lake Huron. Later he settled in nearby Stanley Township, Huron County, Ontario where he was living in 1844. While in Stanley he sent for his mother who came out with his two sisters and their families. Also in 1844 he married Nancy Pollock in Exeter, Ontario. Nancy was born on Jun.12, 1821, in County Derry, the daughter of James Pollock. Archibald and Nancy had twelve children listed below. During the years in Stanley, they endured the hardships of pioneer life, living in a log house and using sheets of bark in the doorway and windows. The maple trees which surrounded them were tapped, the sap being made into sugar which was carried many miles to Goderich where it was sold or bartered. In 1867 all the family except eldest daughter Margaret who had married the previous year moved to Stephen Township, Huron County, where daughter Nancy and son Alexander were married. Then, in 1876, eldest son Alexander was the first to move to Fairgrove, Michigan. The following summer Archibald went to Michigan where he bought 80 acres where Ed Holden now lives and 100 acres owned by the McKinny boys. Only five acres were cleared that summer and he returned to Canada until the next spring. Archibald died on Jul.6, 1891, at the age of 71 and Nancy on Jun.12, 1903. Both are buried in Brookside, Fairgrove, Michigan. According to her death certificate Nancy had 12 children, 9 of whom were living in 1905.\n\nMargaret McCloy was born on Nov.18, 1845, in Huron County and on Christmas Day, 1866, married William McLeod, born 1846. They stayed in Stanley when her mother and father moved to Stephen in 1867. In 1880 they moved to Manitoba. They were true pioneers, travelling to St. Boniface by boat and then by ox-drawn wagon to a homestead about 10 miles north of Birtle. They experienced Indians and prairie fires and lived on the wild game, grain and fruit. An account written by their daughter Sara Fisher McLeod survived and was published in Canadian Genealogist by Velma Beyette. Margaret McLeod died on Jan.26, 1887, in Solsgirth, Manitoba and is buried in Silver Creek Cemetary, Angusville, Manitoba. William died on Jun.4, 1924, in Norgate, Manitoba. They had two children:\n\nJames McLeod who died at the age of 23.\n\nSara Fisher McLeod was born on May 24, 1870, in Grand Bend, Huron County, Ontario, and moved to Manitoba with her parents in 1880. Her story of the pioneering days of her parents has been mentioned above. She was married on Feb.4, 1891, to Frank Angus in Silver Creek, Manitoba. Frank was born on Oct.16, 1860, in Tuckersmith Township, Huron County, Ontario, and left there in 1882 to join his brother John in what later became Angusville, Manitoba.

A lease dated Apr.30, 1823, indicates that William had secured the holding of more than 37 acres in Deerpark West where his uncle Alexander McCloy had farmed. In the Griffith Valuation of about 1860 William is listed as holding about 75 acres of land worth 22 pounds in the townland of Munie South, parish of Tickmacrevan, from the Earl of Antrim. On that property is a house worth 3 pounds. William also subleased a house and garden worth 30 shillings to John Burnim and an ``office'' (shed) worth 5 shillings to William McKellip. Between Feb.28, 1828, and Aug.18, 1830, William was granted a lease in North Munie and he is included in the 1832 Tithe Applotment Records for Upper Munie, Parish of Tickmacrevan. William died on Dec.27, 1862, aged 78. The children of William and Marjorie McCloy are listed separately below.\n\nRobert McCloy was born about 1787 and died on Dec.18, 1820, aged 33.\n\nJane McCloy was born about 1791 and died unmarried at the age of 70 in 1861.\n\nMary McCloy was born about 1794, was baptized on Jan.9, 1794, and died unmarried on Apr.5, 1822.\n\nSamuel McCloy was born about 1796 and died on July 14, 1835, aged 36.\n\nDaniel McCloy was born in 1798 and inherited the Munie farm and ``Parkview'' house when his father died. He is included along with \"Widow McCloy\" (presumably his mother) in the 1832 Tithe Applotment Records for Lower Munie, Parish of Tickmacrevan. In the Griffith Valuation of about 1860 Daniel is listed as holding 79 acres of land valued at 21 pounds in the townland of Munie North, parish of Tickmacrevan, from the Earl of Antrim. The house on this property is valued at 2 pounds and 5 shillings and is probably the ancestral home known as ``Parkview''. The front of this house and the roof were probably built around 1825. Also from the Griffith Valuation we learn that Daniel subleased small houses worth 5 shillings to Alexander Buntin, John McGavock, Charles Hamill and Hyndman McGuickan. In 1863, he also acquired the 14 acre farm in North Munie previously held by John McCloy. He may also have had other, smaller holdings in the area. Daniel McCloy married Anne White from Whitehall, Broughshane, a primitive painting of whom was found among the works of Lady I. Kerr. Anne insisted on ``Parkview'' being extended. Today it retains more or less the same style as she gave it in the early 1800s. The view from the house is breath-taking. Daniel farmed the lands around Parkview and Munie as well as ``Longfield'' which probably refers to his holding in the Deerpark. The land was partly arable and partly hilly where sheep were grazed. Daniel died on Apr.4, 1878, aged 79, and he and his family are remembered in the following gravestone inscription from the Old Glenarm Churchyard at Glebe: ``Erected by Daniel McCloy in memory of his beloved children. Marjorie McCloy who died August 1852 aged 14 years. Also Joseph McCloy who died March 1853 aged 2 years. Also William McCloy, M.D. who died in India August 1862 aged 32 years. Also Daniel John McCloy who died Oct. 1870 aged 25 years. (Also the a)bove (Daniel McC)loy who died 6th April 1877 aged 79 years, Ann his wife who died 20th Dec. 1883 aged 76 years.'' Daniel also left a will in which, after making provisions for his wife, he left five pounds to each of his daughters, Mary, Ann Eliza and one other. He also left five pounds to his son Alexander and he left the farm which had previously been intended for his deceased son Daniel John to his son Samuel. The children of Daniel and Ann McCloy:\n\nEllen McCloy was born about 1827 and died on Mar.9, 1906, at the age of 79.\n\nWilliam McCloy was born in 1830 and became a doctor in India.

They left their eldest son, James Miller, behind in Ireland in the care of Margaret's parents but took the other two with them. In New Zealand they had another 5 children. Margaret died in 1904. The children of William and Margaret Miller:\n\nJames Miller, the eldest son, was left behind in the care of his grandparents when his parents emigrated to New Zealand. He used to write to his siblings signing his letters, ``Your unwanted brother''. James changed his last name to McCloy. He had a family including a granddaughter, Irene Bourton.\n\nseven other Miller children who grew up in New Zealand.\n\nMarjorie McCloy was born about 1838 and died in August 1852 aged 14.\n\nSamuel McCloy was born about 1841 and was married in the Glenarm Presbyterian Meetinghouse on Dec.19, 1866, to Rosetta Craig, a full age spinster (born 1848) from Gortnacory, Carnlough, whose father was Samuel Craig, a farmer. Samuel is listed as of full age, a bachelor farmer from Munie whose father was Daniel McCloy, a farmer. Daniel McCloy witnessed the marriage. Samuel was living in Munie North at the time of his marriage. In 1878 Samuel inherited his father's two farms in North Munie as well as \"Parkview\" and the 16 acres in Deerpark West.
