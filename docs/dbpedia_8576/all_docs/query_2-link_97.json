        "text": "One of the most notorious theatrical quarrels began in 1895, when Bernard Shaw, the new drama critic of the Saturday Review, took aim at London's most prestigious actor, Henry Irving, manager of the Lyceum Theatre. On 12 January, Irving mounted J. Comyns Carr's King Arthur;a week later he had the pleasure of opening the Saturday to read: \"I sometimes wonder where Mr. Irving will go when he dies—whether he will dare to claim, as a master artist, to walk where he may any day meet Shakespeare whom he has mutilated, Goethe whom he has travestied, and the nameless creator of the hero-king out of whose mouth he has uttered jobbing verses.\"1 From the beginning, Shaw directed his outrage chiefly at the plays Irving staged rather than at the actor himself: by refusing to mount the New Drama, Irving actively hindered theatrical progress, which meant to Shaw, not coincidently, the transcendence of the playwright over the actor. Not that Shaw didn't get personal. Irving's Richard the Third, he claimed, was impish buffoonery, his Mephistopheles a travesty, and his Don Quixote an exercise in sheer clownishness.2\n\nThroughout, Irving remained largely silent, though remarking privately, \"I would cheerfully pay the man's funeral expenses at any time.\"3 He had a measure of revenge when, in 1895, Shaw sent him his play The Man of Destiny, admitting to the actress Ellen Terry that a production by Irving would be the making of him. Irving toyed with his torturer, even inviting him to the Lyceum for an interview (\"He is without exception,\" Shaw wrote Terry, \"absolutely the stupidest man I ever met. Simply no brains—nothing but character and temperament.\")4 Irving did not produce Shaw's play. By Irving's death in 1905, Shaw still was not acknowledged [End Page 79] as a major playwright. This may have given the actor some satisfaction, though he could not forget Shaw's seditious courtship of his beloved acting partner, Ellen Terry."
