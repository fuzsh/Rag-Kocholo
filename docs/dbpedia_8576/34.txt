Born in 1960 at Whitstable, Kent. Bridget Moore studied art at Medway College of Design, Epsom School of Art & Design, then the Royal Academy Schools, graduating in 1984 when she was awarded the prestigious Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Award.

Bridget̛s work often touches on childhood memories from Whitstable (where her family still live), trying to evoke and recapture the atmosphere and qualities of experiences distilled over the years. Other themes such as decayed opulence, the rich colours and lights of theatres, circuses and fairgrounds also hold a particular fascination for her. Her ability to capture such rich scenes led the then Spectator critic Giles Auty to describe one of her works in the Royal Academy Summer Show of 1992 as a “small, intense treasure”.

She frequently references intimate interiors of the home (now demolished) where her grandparents lived. Originally built as a summer house for the actress Dorothea Baird this house stood in the grounds of the windmill overlooking Whitstable and was owned by her son Laurence Irving the theatre and film set designer. He had also attended the RA schools and as godfather to Bridget̛̛s mother, Laurence Irving took a keen interest in and encouraged Bridget̛̛s work. They corresponded and she visited him until his death in 1988.

Elected a member of The Royal Society of British Artists in 1989 and a member of The New English Art Club in 2005 she has exhibited continually since leaving art school. Her work has been seen in mixed and solo shows in many London galleries and across the UK including Royal Academy Summer Shows and also in the USA. Amongst some of the prizes awarded her she was a runner up in the Lynn Painter-Stainers prize for 2006. Married with two children she now lives in Dorking.
