Running time: 122 MIN.\n\nHanno Hackmann Heiner Lauterbach Bernie Weskamp Axel Milberg Gabrielle Hackmann Sibylle Canonica Dr. Wagner Barbara Rudnik Babsi Claasen Sandra Speichert Norbert Armin Rohde Heribert Kurtz Stefan Juergens Schacht Rudolf Kowalski Von Zitkau Martin Benrath With: Rudolf Kowalski, Hermann Lause, Bastian Trost, Anya Hoffmann, Hans-Michael Rehberg, Maren Kroymann, Dietrich Schwanitz.\n\nThe speed and thoroughness with which German cinema has been reinventing itself these past few years is nowhere better illustrated than in \"Campus,\" a quality widescreen dramedy about a university prof facing a sexual harassment case that in every respect, apart from its language, plays like a well-honed Hollywood pic. Latest movie by Soenke Wortmann, one of the pioneers of the current renaissance (\"Der bewegte Mann\"), is a step away from pure comedies and into the big league, and has attracted warm biz locally. But whether a foreign-lingo movie that's so close to U.S. fare can click offshore, let alone Stateside, remains to be seen.\n\nApart from its smooth tech ride, pic uncannily catches the internal rhythms, emotional cadences and well-tested structural devices of the best script-led Hollywood product. Without demeaning Wortmann's accomplishment, or the pic's aptness to a German setting, \"Campus\" requires hardly a tweak for a U.S. remake: Slip Kevin Kline into the lead role, Glenn Close into the part of feminist lecturer and Bob Balaban into the chief toady's shoes - and you're virtually home free.\n\nBased on the novel by Dietrich Schwanitz, story unfolds at an esteemed Hamburg campus where respected sociology professor Hanno Hackmann (Heiner Lauterbach) delights his snooty wife (Sibylle Canonica) by agreeing to run for president of the university against the incumbent, corrupt smoothie Schacht (Rudolf Kowalski). Before sailing into battle, Hackmann has one crease to iron out of his life - his affair with a drama student, Babsi (Sandra Speichert).\n\nAfter a final, unplanned coupling, Hackmann reckons he's drawn a neat line under their relationship. Babsi, who's just landed the part of a rape victim in a college play, draws too closely on her own sexual experiences in rehearsal and is bumped from the cast. Mortified, she has a breakdown and ends up in a psychiatric ward; soon, innuendo starts flying that she was sexually harrassed by a senior member of staff, a spark fanned by the tightly wound Dr. Wagner (Barbara Rudnik), a lecturer in women's studies who's just itching for a showdown with the male-dominated administration.\n\nAs the finger of suspicion points toward Hackmann, Schacht and his ambitious lackies orchestrate a witch hunt, seized on by the press, to crush Hackmann before the election.\n\nThough the movie has its serious moments, especially in the final reels, it largely adopts a quietly satirical approach to its characters and setting, peppered with anarchic moments. Despite the fact that he's clearly not guilty of any harassment, Hackmann is portrayed as a clever maneuverer up the greasy pole of academe whose comeuppance is long overdue. In a great speech by him near the end, the pic movingly reveals its hidden target - modern society's unholy alliance of compromise, corporatism and correctness, which has has infected higher education.\n\nLauterbach, an immensely skilled actor, is perfectly cast as Hackmann, managing to carry the audience's sympathies through a part that switches from charming respectability through blind panic to dignified self-criticism. The other players all hit their character marks with precision, from Rudnik's highly focused feminist to Axel Milberg's ambitious today and Kowalski's spin-on-a-dime careerist politician.\n\nWortmann's grip falters at the very end with a coda that's a little too neat, but pic generally sustains its two-hour running time. Production values are typical of high-end fare from producer Bernd Eichinger's Constantin banner."
