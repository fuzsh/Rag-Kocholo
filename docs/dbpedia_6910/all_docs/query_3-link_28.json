As one of Europe’s leading producers, he took German-language films to an international audience, competing with Hollywood studios for the lucrative English-language market, with big-budget movies financed and made in Europe — and ruffling more than a few feathers on the way.\n\nOver 35 years he produced almost 100 films. Notable among them were Downfall (2004), which turned Hitler’s last days into a compelling and complex character drama; The Name of the Rose (1986), the medieval murder mystery starring Sean Connery; The NeverEnding Story (1984) and Resident Evil (2002), a spin-off from the hit zombie video game that spawned a franchise."
