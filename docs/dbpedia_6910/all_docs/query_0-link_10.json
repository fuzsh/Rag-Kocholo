The only place he can find to sleep is at the apartment of a gay acquaintance who would like nothing better than to seduce Axel. Doro announces that she is pregnant, then finds Axel and his roommate Norbert in a compromising position and decides her lover is gay. In the comedy of errors that follows, everything Axel does to win Doro back goes hilariously wrong"
