        "text": "The sudden death of Bernd Eichinger has left German cinema reeling, as arguably its most powerful and influential figure is no longer around. Eichinger started writing and directing in the early 70s New German Cinema ferment, but really made his mark as a producer – his first serious credit was on the 1975 movie The Wrong Movement, directed by NGC wunderkind Wim Wenders. The Wrong Movement is one of those odd Wim Wenders road movies featuring Rüdiger Vogler, made in between Alice in the Cities and Kings of the Road, that were so bafflingly influential at the time. (Try watching Chris Petit's Radio On, you'll see what I mean.)\n\nBut Eichinger's production career didn't take proper wing until the New German Cinema wave was all but over. In 1978 he bought an established distribution company, Constantin Film, and then in 1981, he partnered with director Uli Edel to make an adaptation of the shattering autobiography of a West Berlin junkie, Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo. The film was released in the UK and US under the title Christiane F, and the David Bowie soundtrack meant it swiftly became a cult watch in the early 80s. Arguably the bleakest film ever made – at least until Requiem for a Dream.\n\nEichinger could now take advantage of the increasing profile of German film-makers in the global mainstream, and together with Das Boot director Wolfgang Petersen, he made his entry into the international market with the kids fantasy The NeverEnding Story – Constantin Film's first major production. No Bowie here; Eichinger nailed his musical colours to a mast called Limahl. At $27m, it was Germany's most expensive film, and while it didn't do so well in cimemas, it became a massive take-home success on video.\n\nEichinger could now mount proper prestige productions, and took on\n\nJean-Jacques Annaud's long-nurtured adaptation of Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. The novel was one of the early pan-European blockbusters, and Annaud delivered a suitably multinational film, with Brits, Americans, French, Italians and Russians in the cast.\n\nAll through Eichinger's career, there is a single, tantalising thread. When a bit of sleaze was called for, he got on to Uli Edel. Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn got the Edel treatment in 1989; arguably as dismal a film as Christiane F eight years earlier. This time, though, the American subject matter meant its notoriety was on a whole new level. Jennifer Jason Leigh's career never really got over her portrayal of the brutalised prostitute Tralala, and Alexis Arquette certainly never topped his turn as drag queen Georgette.\n\nArguably Eichinger's 1990s high point was the skincrawling adaptation of Ian MacEwan's novel, The Cement Garden, written and directed by his Name of the Rose scripter Andrew Birkin. Shamelessly exploiting Charlotte Gainsbourg's perceived association with Serge-related incest, The Cement Garden looks even stranger now – you literally cannot believe it would be made in this day and age.\n\nEichinger – and German cinema as a whole – found a new lease of life in the new millennium, as the world discovered a new appetite for postwar German history. Eichinger had never completely given up on writing, and his screenplay credit for Downfall, the story of Hitler's last days, meant that his personal input into the new mood can't be overestimated.\n\nThe celebrated scene in which Bruno Ganz berates the Nazi high command of course has gone down in internet legend as the raw material for hundreds of parodies. Eichinger is on record as loving the meme – and who wouldn't be? \"Fuck YouTube\", indeed.\n\nNo doubt inspired by the success of Downfall, Eichinger turned to (who\n\nelse?) Uli Edel to help him realise what he no doubt felt was his\n\nultimate creative achievement: a study of the Red Army Faction. With a\n\nscript by Eichinger and Edel, The Baader Meinhof Complex set out, in\n\nnearly three hours, the story of the urban terrorist outfit who\n\nelectrified German radicals in the 70s, and simultaneously revolted\n\nwider society.\n\nIt stands as a fitting epitaph to the man."
