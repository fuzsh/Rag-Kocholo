        "text": "Bernd Eichinger, a German screenwriter and producer who made films in Germany and Hollywood, including the children’s fairy tale “The NeverEnding Story,” the “Resident Evil” series derived from video games, and “Downfall,” a movie about the last days of the Third Reich that raised hackles for humanizing Adolf Hitler, died in Los Angeles on Monday. He was 61.\n\nThe cause was a heart attack, Constantin Film, the Munich company with which he had been affiliated since the late 1970s, said in a statement.\n\nMr. Eichinger was a prominent force in the German film industry beginning in the early 1970s, when he formed a company, Solaris Film, and helped produce early films by Wim Wenders (“Falsche Bewegung,” also known as “False Movement” or “The Wrong Movement” in English-language releases) and Wolfgang Petersen (“Die Konsequenz,” or “The Consequence”) and an adaptation of the Ibsen play “The Wild Duck,” starring Bruno Ganz, the Swiss actor who, nearly three decades later, played Hitler in “Downfall.”\n\nIn 1979, Mr. Eichinger became director of Constantin, which was then a struggling company but has since become one of Germany’s most important production and distribution houses. In addition to “The NeverEnding Story” (1984), a fantasy for children directed by Mr. Petersen that combines live actors and animated creatures, Mr. Eichinger’s producing credits include works like “The Name of the Rose” (1986), an adaptation of Umberto Eco’s 14th-century murder story set in a northern Italian abbey; “Last Exit to Brooklyn” (1989), an adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.’s notoriously harsh novel about life among hookers, drug addicts and wife beaters in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn; “Smilla’s Sense of Snow” (1997), a mystery set in Scandinavia, based on a novel by Peter Hoeg; “Perfume: The Story of a Murderer” (2006), an adaptation of Patrick Süskind’s thriller; and “The Baader Meinhof Complex” (2008), about a terrorist group in West Germany in the 1970s, which was nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign language film.\n\nMr. Eichinger was born on April 11, 1949, in Neuburg an der Donau, northwest of Munich. His father, Manfred, was a doctor. Bernd attended film school in Munich before beginning his career. He is survived by his mother, Ingeborg; his wife, Katja, whom he married in 2006; and a daughter, Nina.\n\n“Downfall” (2004), which was written as well as produced by Mr. Eichinger (and was also nominated for an Oscar), tells the story of Hitler’s final days, portraying life with his close compatriots in his Berlin bunker.\n\nBased partly on a memoir by one of Hitler’s secretaries and partly on historical texts, the film, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, portrayed Hitler in an almost neutral fashion. It depicted his paranoid rantings as Berlin was under assault by Russian artillery and the Germans faced certain defeat, but also featured moments of warmth and thoughtfulness. Many critics, especially inside Germany, felt that any attempt to humanize Hitler was ill advised.\n\n“The lack of narrative position alone,” the filmmaker Wim Wenders wrote, escorts the audience “into a black hole in which they are led, almost unnoticeably, toward looking at this time through the eyes of the perpetrators, and generates a kind of benevolent understanding of them.”\n\nMr. Eichinger rejected such criticism, saying in a 2005 interview that the Nazi period was the “darkest” in German history and that it “traumatized not only the generation which was involved, but traumatized also my generation.” He added that to attack the film for showing that Hitler had human traits was unjust.\n\n“There is no such thing as telling the truth and not taking everything into consideration,” he said. “Otherwise you are a Stalinist with one view of things. You burn what doesn’t fit your position or put it into the archives because you want to show only bad and good. When I wrote this script, for me the important thing was to show the gray.”"
