        "text": "German film producer and director Bernd Eichinger has died in Los Angeles aged 61.\n\nEichinger‘s production credits include The Name Of The Rose, Perfume and 1984 children’s fantasy The Neverending Story.\n\nHe was also the screenwriter and producer of the Oscar-nominated Downfall in 2008. The film sparked controversy for showing a human side to Adolf Hitler.\n\nFurther controversy followed Eichinger that year, when he was criticised by many for his film The Baader Meinhof Complex, which was about 1970s German left-wing terrorists the Red Army Faction.\n\nRelatives of those killed by the group accused him of glamourising the terror organisation, but Eichinger said he was allowing the “monstrosity of the events” to grab the audience’s attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis company, Constantin Media, announced that Elchinger suffered a sudden heart attack during a meal with family and friends."
