        "text": "German film producer, screenwriter, and director (1949– 2011)\n\nBernd Eichinger (German: [bɛʁnt ˈaɪ.̯çɪŋ.ɐ] ⓘ; 11 April 1949 – 24 January 2011) was a German film producer, screenwriter, and director.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nEichinger was born in Neuburg an der Donau. He attended the University of Television and Film Munich in the 1970s and bought a stake in the fledgling studio company Neue Constantin Film in 1979, becoming its executive director. Under his leadership, Constantin Film evolved into one of the most successful German film businesses. As of 2005, he was chairman of the supervisory board and still owned a substantial stake in the company. Eichinger also produced some movies independently (for example, Downfall).[1] One of Eichinger's last films was about the left-wing terrorist group Red Army Faction (RAF) and based on the book Der Baader Meinhof Komplex (\"The Baader-Meinhof Complex\") by Stefan Aust.[2]\n\nThe range of genres of films, for television and the big screen, was unusually varied. He produced a 3D zombie movie, Resident Evil: Afterlife; to Atomised, a film adaptation of novel by French star writer and social critic Michel Houellebecq. He was an incredibly prolific film maker, with almost 100 films to his credit.[3]\n\nEichinger was known as tenacious. It took him 20 years to convince Patrick Süskind, the German author of Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, to trust him with the rights to make the international bestseller into a film. In 2006, the film was released, grossing $135 million worldwide.[3]\n\nIn the 1980s, Eichinger obtained the film rights to the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer, decades before making movies based on Marvel comics was trending.[3]\n\nIn 1991, he was a co-founder of Summit, the Los Angeles-based production and film sales company. Due to the success of Twilight, Summit eventually became Summit Entertainment.[3]\n\nFamily\n\n[edit]\n\nEichinger was married to Katja Hofmann, a journalist. He had a daughter from a previous relationship, Nina Eichinger, an actress and TV presenter.[4]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nEichinger died of a heart attack in Los Angeles on 24 January 2011 at the age of 61.[1][5]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\n1984 Bavarian Film Awards, Best Producing\n\n1986 Bavarian Film Awards, Best Producing\n\n1993 Bavarian Film Awards, Best Producing[6]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nBernd Eichinger's best known films include:\n\nYear Title Director Based on Language Notes 1977 Grete Minde Heidi Genée A novel by Theodor Fontane German 1977 Die Konsequenz Wolfgang Petersen An autobiographical novel by Alexander Ziegler German TV film 1977 Hitler: A Film from Germany Hans-Jürgen Syberberg German 1978 The Glass Cell Hans W.
