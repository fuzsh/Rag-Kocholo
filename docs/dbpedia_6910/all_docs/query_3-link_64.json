        "text": "BORN: April 11, 1949. DIED: January 24, 2011, AGED 61\n\n“The genius of German cinema is dead” is how one German tabloid reported the sudden death of Bernd Eichinger.\n\nEXPRESS CASINO: GET A FREE BONUS OF UP TO £150 NOW!\n\nIt is easy to understand why Eichinger was held in such esteem.\n\nOver the course of his 35-year career he was one of only a handful of Germans to make the leap to Hollywood.\n\nAs the producer of almost 100 films, he was responsible for the Oscar-nominated Downfall, depicting Hitler’s last days, The Name Of The Rose starring Sean Connery, and The Fantastic Four, based on the Marvel comic.\n\nBorn in Neuburg an der Donau in Bavaria, Eichinger attended Munich’s Television and Film Academy in the early Seventies before forming his own company, Solaris Film, which helped produce early films by Wim Wenders (The Wrong Move) and Wolfgang Petersen (The Consequence).\n\nIn 1979, he took on the running of the Munich production and distribution company Constantin Film which became a leading player in the international film industry. Among his most successful global productions were Petersen’s The Never Ending Story, Uli Edel’s Last Exit To Brooklyn and Bille August’s The House Of The Spirits starring Meryl Streep and Glenn Close.\n\nHis greatest success in recent years was 2004’s Der Untergang (Downfall), which he wrote and produced. While the film caused controversy in his homeland with accusations of humanising Hitler, Eichinger rejected such criticism, saying in a 2005 interview the Nazi period was the “darkest” in German history and that it “traumatised not only the generation which was involved but traumatised also my generation”."
