He put Constantin Film back on trail. He and Uli Edel started with this incredibly good movie: Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo. He was always part of something great and produced movies like: Die unendliche Geschichte, Der Name der Rose, Der bewegte Mann, Der Schuh des Manitu, Nirgendwo in Afrika, Resident Evil, Der Untergang, Das Parfum, Der Baader Meinhof Kompelx (he also wrote the script of BMH and for many other very fine films)",

His power and wisdom were amazing. I will always remember him saying: “Jetzt ist Lebenszeit! Ausruhen können wir uns später.“"
