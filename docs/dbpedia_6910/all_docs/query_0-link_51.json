In 1977 Constantin went bankrupt, and its property was acquired by Bernd Eichinger, who launched Neue Constantin Film in 1979. Later not only distribution, but also production of films was started since 1983 and it was renamed back to Constantin Film AG in 1999. The company is best known for producing Der Untergang (Downfall), the Resident Evil film series, and the Fantastic Four movies. It's a wholly owned subsidiary of Highlight Communications AG since 2009.

After a few seconds, the syllables \"Сon\", \"stan\", and \"tin\" zoom up rapidly in sync with the fanfare. \"FILM\" and \"bringt\"fade in below after that.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn an early B&W variant, \"Constantin\" is written in a more graffiti-like form of cursive, and \"bringt\" is in cursive, as well. The animation is also much rougher, with the sunbursts being barely distinguishable from each other, and the syllables are actually inverted at the beginning, but switch colors near the end.\n\nIn another B&W variant the \"Constantin\" seems more shinier than usual.\n\nSometimes, the background is shown in a darker tint, though this might be due to film deterioration.\n\nFor later (post 1979) releases of Constantin Film, \"neue\" is shown above \"Constantin\".\n\nLater Variant: The bluish-white flare of light appears in the black background before the gray, black, and white sunburst background fading in. The logo is redone in HD. \"bringt\" is removed, \"FILM\" part is now in the similar fashion as \"Constantin\", and \"3D\" is seen growing quickly underneath \"Constantin FILM\". When the logo fades out, \"3D\" leaves visible for a half second before fading out.\n\nFX/SFX: The rotating sunbeams, the syllables zooming up.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A long drumroll (changing the pitch higher) following a bombastic fanfare in the key of B-flat (which has a couple different variants), or silence. The later variant has the different, more calmer fanfare.\n\nAvailability: Very rare in the United States, uncommon in Europe and Germany. Seen on distributed or produced films of the time, and usually retained on newer releases, among them the Blu-ray of Winnetou’s film debut, The Treasure of Silver Lake. As for the later variant, it was only seen on the German 3D theatrical print and 3D Blu-Ray of Resident Evil: Retribution.\n\nEditor's Note: The bombastic music and animation has scared more than a few, but it remains a favorite in the logo community.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(1984?-1996?)\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see \"NUE CONSTANTIN FILM\" fade in from black and fade out when finished.\n\nFX/SFX: The text fading in and out.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Silent.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. Was seen on German prints of films produced or distributed by Constantin Film, such as The Neverending Story and In the Name of the Rose. Currently seen on the German Blu-Ray of the former.\n\nEditor's Note: The text \"NEUE\" is misspelled here.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(1980's-1996?)\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see large white words \"NEUE CONSTANTIN FILM\" fade in, each word for a line.\n\nFX/SFX: The text fading in and out.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Silent.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Sometimes plastered over with the next logo, but saved on German prints of films produced or distributed by Constantin Film, such as Die Katze, Feuer, Eis & Dynamit, Der Bewegte Mann and The House of the Spirits.\n\nEditor's Note: Slightly better than before, since the spelling error is fixed.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(1996-)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"194\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/e97c4f861839c6c3bcdd1682761b97dd886e7061\" width=\"345\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/e718258d328b8b9f9470725b845712cd31f458ea\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/db1deb20709eec784589aba1840b0abe12d3c80c\" width=\"329\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/39c023b0cfaa5d007fe0e7fb4e940bd0bdc10657\" width=\"247\"></iframe>\n\nLogo: On a dark blue background, we see a dark roll of film zoom fast to the left, with \"Constantin Film\" in white, and an underlined cursive font (really similar to the 1st logo). A light flashes and the roll of film (still moving) turns upward and \"Constantin Film \" appears in the film strip blinking. The blinking slows down, and we zoom in to the film strip so all we see is \"Constantin Film\", in red, and in the same font with the same underline.\n\nVariants:\n\nStarting in probably 1999, the logo is completely white. Sometimes the URL <a href=\"https://www.constantin-film.de/\" target=\"_self\">www.constantinfilm.de</a> is added below.\n\nSometime after 2010, the name in enhanced with 3D look.\n\nThere's an in-credit closing variant.\n\nFX/SFX: Very good CGI animation. Sometimes, it's still.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A string-driven, triumphant orchestral piece. Sometimes, it is silent, or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability:\n\nEarly Variant: Very rare. Seen on German prints of films produced or distributed by Constantin Film.\n\nLater Variant: Current. It is the easiest logo to find from this company, since they released and co-produced more popular films such as the Resident Evil franchise and released foreign films released in the U.S through Sony Pictures Classics. Also used as home video banner in Germany. Version with URL is seen mostly on German releases and prints.\n\nEditor's Note: A really nice logo thanks to the amazing music and animation, holding up even after 20+ years, making it a favorite in the community.\n\n5th Logo\n\n(2010-)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"216\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/d48ee23c36c1316787221a8241f6ebb33bfa9f16\" width=\"381\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/ee337d18d8c872912be9bdaaded204b54bd3f327\" width=\"397\"></iframe>\n\nLogo: On either a starfield or a black background, we see a blue light go through \"Constantin Film\", showing silhouettes. Once it goes off-screen moving from the right, the logo wipes in.\n\nFX/SFX: Basic, but yet very nice CGI.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A five note horn theme, sounding very similar to the end of the 1993 Columbia Pictures logo, or the opening theme.\n\nAvailability: Current. Seen on almost all of the Resident Evil movies in North America. Used in tandem with the previous logo.\n\nEditor's Note: None."
