        "text": "Cool pose, cigarette, denim jacket and a poster on the wall for his film, \"Last Exit to Brooklyn.\" Bernd Eichinger embodied a lot of things, including the nonchalance of the film industry and the dream of Hollywood success. Here's a look at the filmmaker's life with images from the \"…Everything is Cinema\" exhibition, now on show at Berlin's Deutsche Kinemathek museum for film and television.\n\nLong before becoming one of the world's most successul producers, Eichinger's career began at a film school in Munich with plenty of self-directed film projects. In his graduation project, \"Christmas Fairytale,\" from 1974, he even played the lead role himself. Later, he would return again and again to the director's chair.\n\nAfter his studies, Eichinger worked as a screenplay author and associate producer, but also independently produced smaller films. His big breakthrough came in 1981 with the drug drama \"Christiane F. - We Children from Bahnhof Zoo.\" David Bowie, pictured here, appeared in the film, which became an international success.\n\nEichinger's success story began in Germany in the 1980s. He garnered the biggest film budgets of any producer in the country and managed incredibly intricate cinematic projects, such as \"The Neverending Story\" (1983), with ease. At the same time, Eichinger founded the company Constantin Film, establishing himself as a buyer and distributor in the industry.\n\nEichinger was a workaholic in nearly every area of the industry. In addition to working as a producer and distributor, he also ran cinemas. In Cologne, he opened Germany's first multiplex movie theater - the \"Cinedom - in 1991; it would remain the largest in the country for many years. Eichinger decorated the foyer and walls with pictures of famous cinema personalities.\n\nMany people in the film industry have dreamt of Hollywood. But Bernd Eichinger was one of the few Germans who managed to achieve decades of success in the cutthroat business of cinema. Though he spent time in the US as an aspiring young filmmaker, it wasn't until later in his career that he established an office in Los Angeles.\n\nEichinger regularly managed to convince Hollywood big shots to star in his productions. In 1986, he got James Bond actor Sean Connery (pictured) on board for his film \"The Name of the Rose.\" Complex film versions of literary classics quickly became a hallmark of the producer. While critics rolled their eyes at these films, they went over well with audiences.\n\nEichinger had an impact on the German film scene as well and can be attributed with the rise of comedy films in the 1990s. \"The Most Desired Man,\" starring then little-known Til Schweiger, became one of Eichinger's biggest hits. Light entertainment with a touch of bawdy humor and a feel for the stars is some of what defined Eichinger's work.\n\nOccasionally, Eichinger would direct his own films. Among the most successful was his 1996 remake of the 1950s hit, \"A Girl Called Rosemarie,\" which brought him more positive criticism than he had been getting. Once again, he proved his ability to spot talent: Nina Hoss, now one of Germany's most successful actresses, played the young Rosemarie.\n\nHe didn't take home the cake, but Eichinger was at least nominated for an Oscar for his film \"The Downfall,\" which also received numerous German film prizes, including a Bambi and a Jupiter Award. The film portraying Adolf Hilter's last days divided audiences, with historians and critics calling it too superficial. People went to see it, however, and it was a box office success.\n\nOn the one hand, Bernd Eichinger wanted to earn money with films, but on the other, he wanted to gain critics' respect. His film version of the successful novel by French author Michel Houellebecq, \"Atomised,\" managed to fulfill both aims. The story focuses on two very different half-brothers and their disturbed sexuality. Eichinger is pictured here with the film's director, Oskar Roehler.\n\nThe filming of the literary bestseller, \"Perfume,\" by Patrick Süskind, brought Eichinger international recognition once again in 2006. Directed by Tom Tykwer (pictured here with Eichinger and actress Karoline Herfurth), the expensive production made use of impressive period costumes and elaborate settings. Eichinger also co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nEichinger's interest in German history came out again and again in his work. In addition to films about the Nazi period and post-war Germany, he invested a lot of energy into his 2008 production of \"The Baader Meinhof Complex.\" Actors Moritz Bleibtreu and Johanna Wokalek (pictured) played Red Army Faction terrorists Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin.\n\nIn 2010, Bernd Eichinger won the coveted German Film Prize for his life's work, garnering praise from both the film industry and critics. The accolade marked a turning point for his image and he gained ever greater respect.\n\nIn 2011, Bernd Eichinger died of a heart attack in Los Angeles at the age of 61. His death was a great loss for German cinema. Some 350 exhibits representing his life are on display at the Deutsche Kinemathek museum for film and television through October 6, 2013."
