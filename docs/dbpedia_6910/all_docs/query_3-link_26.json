        "text": "COLOGNE, Germany — The Berlin International Film Festival has joined the German industry in mourning the death, in Los Angeles Monday night, of producer Bernd Eichinger.\n\nCalling Eichinger a “visionary producer and passionate cineaste,” Berlin Festival director Dieter Kosslick said the producer, whose credits included Downfall, The Name of the Rose and The Baader Meinhof Complex, “continually pushed the limits of the doable.”\n\nEichinger died suddenly of a heart attack on Monday. He was the greatest living German producer and news of his death has stunned the local industry.\n\nTo honor Eichinger, Berlin will screen A Girl Called Rosemarie, one of the rare films he both produced and directed.\n\nThe 50s-set drama features a breakout performance by actress Nina Hoss in the title role. Hoss is member of the international jury in Berlin this year, together with Canadian director Guy Maddin, The Piano producer Jan Chapman, Bollywood star Aamir Khan and Oscar-winning costume designer Sandy Powell (Shakespeare in Love). Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi’s name officially remains on the jury list, although the acclaimed filmmaker is in jail in Tehran serving a six-year-sentence for allegedly “inciting opposition protests.”"
