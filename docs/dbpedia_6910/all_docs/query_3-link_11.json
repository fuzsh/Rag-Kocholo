        "text": "German movie/television producer Bernd Eichinger has carved a niche for himself both in his homeland and in other parts of the world, with multitude award nominations/wins across the globe (Emmy Awards, German Comedy Awards, London Critics Circle Film Awards, etc.). Eichinger attended the University of Television and Film in Munich during the 1970s, and just before the close of the decade bought a stake in the up-and-coming studio company, Neue Constantin Film. Eichinger would become the executive director of the company, which would eventually blossom and flourish in the German movie business. Eichinger would also launch his career as a movie/television producer during this time, with such titles as \"Falsche Bewegung,\" \"Hitler: A Film from Germany,\" and \"Tales from the Vienna Woods.\" But it would be in the 1980s that Eichinger would start racking up awards for his work, including two Bavarian Film Awards, for 1984's \"The NeverEnding Story\" and 1986's \"The Name of the Rose.\" Further acclaimed films would follow, tops being 2006's \"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,\" which brought Eichinger multiple award nominations/wins."
