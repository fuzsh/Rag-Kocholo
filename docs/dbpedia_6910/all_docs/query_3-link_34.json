        "text": "Movie producer Bernd Eichinger, who backed films such as The Name of the Rose, Resident Evil and The Baader Meinhof Complex, has died. He was 61.\n\nEichinger suffered a deadly heart attack Monday night during a dinner with family and friends in Los Angeles, according to his studio, Constantin Film AG.\n\nThe German-born Eichinger moved between Germany and Hollywood in a career that began in the 1970s.\n\nHe bought a stake in the fledgling studio company Neue Constantin Film in 1979 and became its executive director, shaping it into one of the most successful German studios.\n\nEichinger also produced some movies independently, including Downfall, a film about the last days of Nazi Germany that he also wrote. The film earned an Oscar nomination in 2005.\n\nEichinger won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film for Nowhere in Africa in 2003.\n\nOne of his earliest English-language films was the fantasy The Neverending Story, and he also produced the Leslie Nielsen comedy Wrongfully Accused.\n\nCredits included Fantastic Four and Perfume â€” The Story of A Murder. His Resident Evil: Afterlife came out just last year. Eichinger also had plans to adapt the story of Natascha Kampusch, the Austrian girl who was kidnapped at age 10 and held in a cell for more than eight years, for the screen.\n\nEichinger is survived by his wife, Katja, a film journalist, and daughter Nina, a TV personality."
