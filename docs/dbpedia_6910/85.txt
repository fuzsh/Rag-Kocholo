He was a producer and writer, known for Der Untergang (2004), Der Baader Meinhof Komplex (2008) and Das Parfum - Die Geschichte eines MÃ¶rders (2006). He was married to Katja Hofmann.

According to George A. Romero, the rejection of his Resident Evil (2002) script was due to Eichinger. Everyone else associated with the pre-production apparently liked the script.
