I am getting decent at Gimp - still a lot I don't know but I can make some nice things with it. I am looking at other options; ones that don't cost $1,000. Photoshop is not for me because it releases inferior versions on purpose to keep the price high. Right-wing business techniques disqualify this company from my money.",
