        "text": "I have to kindly disagree about this guys. You see:\n\nFirst I had an ADOBE chat support agent tell me that THIS is the place to ask.\n\nSecond i have to make a disclaimer - THIS IS NOT INTENDED to be an OFFICIAL answer/statement and my question DOES NOT hold any legal or official weight for its answer.\n\nBy asking my question and thread here i hereby relieve Adobe from all and any legal attachments or official formalities regarding my inquiry.\n\nI only want to know their OPINION and VIEW on the matter, NOT their policy on the matter!\n\nI means that I miss Steve Jobs. I loved to view his presentations they made my day. He was as good as P.T. Barnum and he is gone too. The show must go on... Who do we have today \"Trump\" pleas forgive me if I'm not impressed. Here is a PT quote:\n\n“Nobody ever lost a dollar by underestimating the taste of the American public.”\n\nJJMack\n\nWell i actually think it would be okay for some admin or mod to do so. I've seen adobe comment on such occasions and i do believe they're good enough people to care from time to time (helloooooooooo)\n\nAlso i was actually hoping if some user here knows if they HAVE already spoke on the matter... although i did a deep google search, i believe there are far more informed and smart people here than me!!\n\nI'm very inspired by his character (and of Bill Gates as well) and i must say that since he's gone the apple went rotten (quite the pun).\n\nHowever i still do not get the connection from either this post or the one before about what i asked.\n\nI do believe Steve went way to early, we need him right now in this age of technology, progress,, A.I., even better and faster productions.\n\nBut it is what it is. We could view it as that he did his job way to splendid already...\n\nBUT I would appreciate if someone really dug me up on the question of Adobe and Gimp\n\nWho do you want? Shantanu Narayen he is just trying to use Steve's old wardrobe but he can not fill his shoes. What would anyone's view do for you? My view is Photoshop is better for I have invested a lot in Photoshop. Adobe has a lot invested in Photoshop. Gimp is not in my Picture Gimp has been around for the longest time. Adobe has never commented on it as far as I know and I do not think they ever will. Why would they? There is no real need too.\n\nI never needed Steve but I enjoyed him.\n\nJJMack\n\nYeah but i'm still curious.\n\nExample -- Gates and Jobs COULD've said about products of one another's companies that were highly... unethical... stolen... wrong... a copy..\n\nBut instead they actually choose to welcome the competition AND the whole influence of one another.\n\nThey actually supported each other in the \"back-end\".\n\nOn the other hand there are companies who have really spent years developing something and RIGHTFULLY hunt down thieves, copy-cats and overall competition that STEALS their ideas... the same ones that the company fought, developed and stood for so long.\n\nSo i was wondering if Adobe sees GIMP as a lower-class yet proper alternative OR does she treat it as some user-mock-up type of lame excuse to try and steal their ideas under the GNU license.\n\nTrust me, the reason why i want to know is very strong and important one, and has absolutely 0% connection to any legal/official position here.\n\n@postrophe\n\nYes, and i do not argue about the difference of usability. To me photoshop will always be a king, i grew with it using the CS6 & 7 versions and of lately i started buying myself the CC monthly version out of respect towards Adobe (although i f-king hate your Linux policy, people!! Buuut karma hits you back on that front.)\n\nHowever dont you think that GIMP is just a knock-off ripp-off of photoshop for free?\n\nDoesnt ADOBE see it that way?\n\nDo they condemn it?\n\nOr are they okay with it?\n\nOr do they welcome it?\n\nHi\n\nI used \"ImagePro\" ancestor of Photoshop in the late 80's in a special lab of my university (I'm a Mac guy since then), that was cool. I'v seen it's evolution since then.\n\nIt became a bit bloated over the years with all the plug's they added to it.\n\nI'm not sure if \"AFFINITY PHOTO\" borrowed codes elsewhere, but they only worked at it since 5 years.\n\nTechnology evolve faster that one might thing, it's implementation is the hard part, it can be better starting on a fresh state.\n\nAs \"JJ\" says, PS need a good clean up.\n\nJust my 2¢\n\nPierre\n\ngener7​ I'm very grateful for you digging up that for me.\n\nYet still i only see a comparison of quality -- that is totally NOT what interests me.\n\nFrom what i imagine given the posts though - Adobe doesn't care about gimp one bit.\n\nBut that is only a judgement on my part.\n\nI'm 100000% sure they HAVE a very developed opinion on the matter.\n\nI was in charge of a business not long ago myself. And since i was the main active manager/organizer/everything there i can tell you this: If someone regardless be it a client or outside person asks me what i think about some of our competiton -- i will reply very respectfully and as short as possible. And i will avoid any qualifications or judgements on my part.\n\nHOWEVER if they really inquire about it in a friendly chat -- man i can speak A LOT about the competition. Its not the best thing to do online publicaly for a magazine, sure -- but trust me: Anyone actively involved in business KNOWS its surrounding players SO F*CKING well they can write an ESSAY on the matter.\n\nOf course the bigger the company the stricker the Terms and Conditions / EULA on these parts..\n\n...but i was sincerely hoping for just a friendly comment/clarification, not a real statement, you know."
