If we had patrons requesting it, I’d install it. I used to install it as a matter of course as well & like you, I haven’t much lately. We have MS Office on all of our patron pcs & it has a photo editor (Photo Manager in MS Office Tools) that is pretty brainless to use for average user. It is definitely not a Photoshop replacement but works (especially to convert & compress photos).

I used to install it on patron computers as a matter of course, but haven't so much lately. Mostly just because it caters to a pretty specific audience: people that want to do advanced graphics editing (retouching photos...things of that nature). For the very casual photo editing, some of the other programs out there might be a little easier to use for novice users. Gimp is very powerful, but has a steeper learning curve in my opinion. I'd say that if you have patrons requesting it, then by all means go ahead and install it for them! It's not difficult to install. ______________________________ Chad Neeper Senior Systems Engineer Level 9 Networks 740-548-8070 (voice) 866-214-6607 (fax) Full LAN/WAN consulting services -- Specialized in libraries and schools On 7/20/2011 1:45 PM, Marlene Pelyhes wrote: Hi all, We had a patron request that we install GIMP on our public PCs. I do not know much about it other than: GIMP is a versatile graphics manipulation package. Does anyone else have this software on their public computers? Do you add open source software to them.. on request? thanks Marlene Pelyhes IT, Manager Mentor Public Library _______________________________________________ OPLINTECH mailing list OPLINTECH at lists.oplin.org http://lists.oplin.org/mailman/listinfo/oplintech Search: http://oplin.org/techsearch -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...
