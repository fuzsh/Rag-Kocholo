What is the programming language used to develop gimp.\n\nMost of it is written in C, some parts of the build system use a bit of Perl. A quick look at the source code would have allowed you to answer your own question easily. In addition to the gimp core written in C, you can also have the various scripting extensions written in Scheme (Script-Fu or the newer Tiny-Fu), Perl and Python.\n\n2. What are the tools and compilers that i need to compile gimpe source code.\n\nPlease have a look at:\n\nhttp://www.gimp.org/source/ (stable version) http://developer.gimp.org/ (development version) That will give you all the necessary information. In addition, once you have a look at the source code, please read the README and INSTALL files. If you get the code from CVS, you can also have a look at the HACKING file.\n\n3. What is the latest version of GIMPs source code.\n\nThe latest version of the source code is in CVS. If you want tarballs, then the latest stable version is 2.0.2 and the latest unstable version is 2.1.1, available from ftp.gimp.org and its mirrors. This information is also available from the web sites listed above. Please have a look at them.\n\n-Raphaël\n\nHi Chamal,\n\nQuoting Chamal De Silva :\n\n1. What is the programming language used to develop gimp.\n\nThe GIMP is almost entirely coded in C. There are plug-ins in python, perl and scheme too, and there are some hardware specific routines in assembler, designed to speed up rendering on certain common platforms.\n\n2. What are the tools and compilers that i need to compile gimpe source code.\n\nAny C compiler should do. You will also need automake, autoconf, cvs, intltool, gettext and some other tools if you wouyld like to build from CVS. The details are in the files HACKING and INSTALL.\n\nYou will also need a working installation of GTK+ 2.4.x (for the HEAD or development releases), and Xft, fontconfig and friends. And helper libraries for all the file formats you would like to see compiled in (there is a longish list, again this is in INSTALL.\n\n3. What is the latest version of GIMPs source code.\n\nThis is always HEAD in CVS. However, the latest released source code is version 2.1.1. The latest stable version is 2.0.2.\n\nCheers, Dave."
