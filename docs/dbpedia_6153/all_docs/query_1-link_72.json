I'm a graphic designer, and I use GIMP as my main photo-editing software. I've edited 23 megapixel images on my Netbook (1.5Ghz dual core, 2GB RAM), running Ubuntu, and found that a lot of factors contribute to how fast GIMP runs. For example, if I switch to XFCE as a window manager, GIMP runs about twice as fast as in Unity (as of 12.04). It is usable in both, however. Also, certain tools become unwieldy over a certain image size. One can for example use the cage transform tool on very large images, but depending on the image size and number of nodes you use, it's going to crawl... even on really good hardware. Also, things like having a good graphics card helps tremendously, but on laptops, all you can really do is max out the RAM, which also helps tremendously. The main reason software companies list minimum requirements is because they are selling commercially packaged software that you often have to buy to get the full version, and you can not return once the seal is broken. With GIMP, you just download it and try it out to see if it fits your needs. There is no consumer risk involved with doing this, and since several people mentioned above, GIMP will run on just about anything that can run a GUI, there is no \"minimum\". If all you are doing is making interface graphics for your software, composed of 1920x1080 user interface screenshots, GIMP should be lightning fast for most things (but also depends on how many layers you have, and how large each one is). Things like the perspective tool can get really slow if your graphics card isn't any good, and if your photo is really big. Maybe someone can toss together a benchmarking plugin that takes some sample images, and processes them in various ways and produces a \"user experience\" rating, sort of like the one Windows uses to tell you they've helped sell you something that's no good for running Windows, but to be honest I'd rather see that progress go towards making tools faster, easier to use, etc. I'm really excited about the upcoming unified transform tool for example. If you want something a lot faster for program UI design, you might check out Inkscape for the construction, then just output whatever resolutions you need. I design websites UIs this way. Hope it helps.

I need to use your software for a project I am currently working on and my laptop has a very moderately powered processor. I have searched your site thoroughly and can find the system requirements for your program nowhere. It is very inconvenient to me and all developers like myself. I kindly request that you please post these on your website as these statistics are very important to many people and would further advance the ease of use of your product.\n\nThe system requirements depend a lot on the kind of images your process and how fast you want this to happen. Roughly any machine big enough to run WinXP can run Gimp... I'm software developer myself and a PC big enough to efficiently run what I need for this (IDEs, compilers...) is more than enough for Gimp. ______________________________**_________________ gimp-developer-list mailing list List address: gimp-developer-list gnome org List membership: https://mail.gnome.org/**mailman/listinfo/gimp-** developer-list<https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-developer-list>\n\nFollow-Ups:\n\nRe: [Gimp-developer] GIMP System Requirements\n\nFrom: Guillermo Espertino (Gez)\n\nRe: [Gimp-developer] GIMP System Requirements\n\nFrom: Jay Smith\n\nReferences:\n\n[Gimp-developer] GIMP System Requirements\n\nFrom: thewall01210\n\nRe: [Gimp-developer] GIMP System Requirements\n\nFrom: Bertrand Denoix\n\n[Date Prev][Date Next] [Thread Prev][Thread Next] [Thread Index] [Date Index] [Author Index]"
