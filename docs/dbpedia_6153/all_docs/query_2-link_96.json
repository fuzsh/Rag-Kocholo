Kimball's 1976 area conference visit to New Zealand is included in this series because of the insight it offers on the faith of the saints in New Zealand. This account, written by Elder M. Russell Ballard, comes from the compiled essay book titled \"Faith\" (Deseret Book Company, 1983). Elder Ballard's account draws upon the first-hand account of Elder Russell M. Nelson, who at the time of these events was President Kimball's personal physician. (\"Faith\" is included in Deseret Book's electronic reference library, \"GospeLink 2001.\" A purchase link to \"GospeLink 2001\" is included at the end of this message.) FAITH BRINGS PRESIDENT KIMBALL TO GATHERING It is March 1976, and the Saints of this South Pacific island are anxiously preparing for their first area conference and the arrival of President Spencer W. Kimball. President Kimball had just concluded a rigorous schedule of conference sessions in Samoa. Between sessions he had selflessly exposed himself to all manner of sickness as he gave blessings to numerous people who sought his aid. Then, shortly afterward, he himself was stricken with a serious illness, similar to the type he had rebuked in several administrations. Both he and Sister Kimball had temperatures of 104 degrees. They were coughing, violently nauseated, and most miserable. Russell M. Nelson, the prophet's attending physician, recalled that President Kimball was \"gray and ashen\" as he and D. Arthur Haycock, President Kimball's secretary, assisted him onto the airplane for the flight to New Zealand. One official scolded Dr. Nelson for allowing President Kimball to get on the plane, saying \"Anyone can see that he's too sick to get on an airplane and fly to New Zealand. You should leave him here in Pago Pago, where he can go to the hospital and get the aid that he needs.\" Nevertheless President and Sister Kimball were settled on the plane with blankets while their fevers raged between 102 and 104 degrees. In New Zealand President and Sister Kimball were rushed to the home of the temple president, and they immediately went to bed. President Kimball asked President N. Eldon Tanner to handle the planned reception with the Maori queen, since he himself was too ill to go. Moreover, he said, \"Sister Kimball and I will not make it to the cultural activities planned for this evening because of our illness. The doctor thinks we should not attend. Therefore, will you please excuse us and begin the meeting on time. Express our regrets to the congregation. We will try to conserve our strength in order to make it to the general sessions of the area conference tomorrow morning.\" President Tanner agreed and left. Dr. Nelson remained with President and Sister Kimball while his wife, Dantzel, went with the other Brethren and their wives to the stadium at the Church College of New Zealand for the cultural program. All was quiet at the temple president's home while the prophet and his wife slept. Brother Nelson recalls what happened then: I was reading in President Kimball's room when he awakened with a start. He said, \"Brother Nelson, what time was that program to begin this evening?\" I said, \"At seven o'clock, President Kimball.\" He said, \"What time is it now?\" I replied, \"It's almost seven.\" Noting that he was soaked in perspiration, I thought his fever may have broken, which indeed it had. His temperature was now 98.6 degrees. He said, \"Tell Sister Kimball we're going!\" Several thoughts flashed through my mind in that instant, culminating in a decision that it would be inadvisable for me to say anything about it being medically inadvisable for him to go. So I quickly went in and said to Sister Kimball, \"We're going.\" They each hurriedly prepared and went to the car that had been made available. So President and Sister Kimball, Brother Haycock, and I drove the short distance from the temple president's home to the Church College stadium, where the activities were being held. As the car entered the stadium, there was a very loud shout that erupted spontaneously. It was so sudden and so deafening that I wondered if it might have been a clap of thunder. The car was driven around the track to the place where President and Sister Kimball could be ushered to their seats; Brother Haycock and I took our seats beside our companions as well. I asked Dantzel what was the cause of that enormous shout. I got the story from her point of view. She said that President Tanner had called the meeting to order at 7:00 P.M. and had explained that President and Sister Kimball were unable to attend because of illness. They were to proceed without them in order that their strength might be preserved to join with the Saints the following day. Then one of the young New Zealanders was called upon to pray. With a faith typical to these Saints in the islands, this young New Zealander gave what my wife described as a rather lengthy prayer. During the course of his prayer, he supplicated the Lord thusly: \"We are three thousand New Zealand youth. We are assembled here, having prepared for six months to sing and to dance for thy prophet. Wilt thou heal him and deliver him here.\" Then, as the \"Amen\" was pronounced, the car entered carrying President and Sister Kimball. They were immediately identified by the assembled throng of thousands, who all spontaneously issued that shout for joy on having their prayer answered so directly.\" (Nelson quotations from: \"From Heart to Heart: An Autobiography,\" by Russell M. Nelson) (From \"Faith,\" Deseret Book Company, 1983) NEXT WEEK: Part 9: New Zealand Temple Pageant ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Returned missionary? Foreign-language speaker?
