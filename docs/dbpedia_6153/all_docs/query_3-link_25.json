        "text": "Held: Friday, 13 September 2013\n\nBack to Outline 08 - Documenting Programs and Procedures. On to Outline 10 - Programing the GIMP Tools.\n\nSummary\n\nWe begin our exploration of GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program. GIMP is an open-source raster graphics editor, which is scriptable by a variant of the Scheme programming language.\n\nRelated Pages\n\nReading: GIMP\n\nEBoard (Source) (PDF)\n\nOverview\n\nWhat is GIMP?\n\nWhy GIMP in 151?\n\nShort Demo.\n\nLab + Reflection.\n\nAdministrivia\n\nWarning! Friday the 13th falls on a Friday this month.\n\nReading for Monday Programming the GIMP Tools\n\nEC Opportunities:\n\nCS Table NEXT Friday (Pair programming)\n\nOther?\n\nSee the previous outline for more details. * Parts of an algorithm * What we're doing in this course.\n\n* GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) is free software. (Free software is related to open-source software, but with a particular political bent.) * It allows you to create and edit a wide variety of images, all of which are pixel-based. Such images are called raster images. * A separate kind of graphics is based on drawing primitives, and is called vector graphics.\n\n* It is intended as a more open alternative to photoshop.\n\n* This is \"An introduction to CS\" not \"Digital Art\". So, why are we studying this GIMP thingy? * The GIMP is scriptable, giving us the opportunity to write algorithms. * About eight years ago, I added a short GIMP section to 151. * About five years ago, I saw some evidence that introductory CS courses that emphasize image manipulation better served a wider variety of students, and decided to adapt that approach to our courses. * I applied for a grant, waited, waited some more, and finally got it. * We had the first GIMP-based 151 two years ago, it had some success, so we continue to use and refine it. * I built MediaScheme, the scripting software for the GIMP on my sabbatical last year. It was used for the first time last spring, and seemed more successful than the previous software we were using.\n\n* Not scripted.\n\n* Do the lab."
