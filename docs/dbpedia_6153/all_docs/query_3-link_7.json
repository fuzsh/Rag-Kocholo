Disagree. I use GIMP a lot and while it's dependable and fast and featureful... it's pretty clear it has a considerable UX problem. Everything takes a few precise clicks, and even finding the right window is a bit hard. I spent a lot of time changing the brush size and the size isn't log, just a slider from 1 to <unusable> pixels. It's not _bad_, it's just getting increasingly important to be agreeable and quick to learn. Unfortunately, UX in modern consumer programs is getting so important everything has to be designed around it, so I think a rewrite would yield superior usability. Programs that are rich in functionality but hard to learn will be replaced with programs where workflow was considered with more weight ; even when the replacement has less features.\n\nOn 7/2/20 7:07 AM, Mathias LANG wrote: > On Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 09:36:28 UTC, Mike James wrote: >> https://forum.dlang.org/post/hinhcixficvfjwidaknc@forum.dlang.org >> >> On Sunday, 1 September 2019 at 18:57:07 UTC, Kamran wrote: >>> Hello everyone, >>> People who forked GIMP, a popular open source image editor are discussing on which language to choose for their rewrite at [1] and they are considering D.

They appear not to have said exactly what the rewrite will entail - and a lot of the discussion on that thread is how D allows usage of C libraries. I'm a bit surprised at the UI rewrite, as D has good GTK support, and the focus of GIMP is not really UI. They could easily use GTK and make the UX better. -Steve\n\nOn Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 09:36:28 UTC, Mike James wrote: > https://forum.dlang.org/post/hinhcixficvfjwidaknc@forum.dlang.org > > On Sunday, 1 September 2019 at 18:57:07 UTC, Kamran wrote: >> Hello everyone, >> People who forked GIMP, a popular open source image editor are discussing on which language to choose for their rewrite at [1] and they are considering D.

How about the many rewrites that turned out making a huge comeback? I'll say it depends, so one should should consider the trade-offs. Probably that's what you meant.\n\nOn Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 14:38:11 UTC, Steven Schveighoffer wrote: > On 7/2/20 7:07 AM, Mathias LANG wrote: >> On Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 09:36:28 UTC, Mike James wrote: >>> https://forum.dlang.org/post/hinhcixficvfjwidaknc@forum.dlang.org >>> >>> On Sunday, 1 September 2019 at 18:57:07 UTC, Kamran wrote: >>>> Hello everyone, >>>> People who forked GIMP, a popular open source image editor are discussing on which language to choose for their rewrite at [1] and they are considering D.

I believe Gimp is the most complex application using Gtk... large C codebase is a message without those high-level language features.\n\nOn Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 09:36:28 UTC, Mike James wrote: > https://forum.dlang.org/post/hinhcixficvfjwidaknc@forum.dlang.org > > On Sunday, 1 September 2019 at 18:57:07 UTC, Kamran wrote: >> Hello everyone, >> People who forked GIMP, a popular open source image editor are discussing on which language to choose for their rewrite at [1] and they are considering D.

You do more with less code and in the long term, you have a more clean code base where you can focus on solving the actual problem rather the thousands of undefined behaviors, verbosity of C/C++. Now, just rewrite a huge C/C++ code base in C/C++ looking for clean up the code, that, I think it is going to be a huge massive waste of time.\n\nOn Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 16:09:10 UTC, Liu wrote: > On Thursday, 2 July 2020 at 09:36:28 UTC, Mike James wrote: >> https://forum.dlang.org/post/hinhcixficvfjwidaknc@forum.dlang.org >> >> -=mike=- > > I think rewrites can be valid if you switch from a buggy/verbose language like C/C++ to a more modern D/rust. You do more with less code and in the long term, you have a more clean code base where you can focus on solving the actual problem rather the thousands of undefined behaviors, verbosity of C/C++. Yes if you can do the rewrite a bit at a time and make the code more maintainable, more open to improvement and modification in the future. So it's less a rewrite more a migration with future proofing in mind. But you have to be careful it's not \"this code sucks so we'll rewrite it in D and then it wont suck\". It's perfectly feasible to rewrite it from the ground up and it'll still suck."
