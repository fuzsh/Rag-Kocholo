        "text": "February 8, 2007 at 12:41 pm | Posted in C#, GIMP, Ramblings | 6 Comments\n\nAbout 10 years ago I had Fortran on my resume but I always felt a bit embarrassed about that. I didnâ€™t really like the language, to put it very mildly. When people inquired about my Fortran knowledge I always mumbled something like `just the basicsâ€™ and tried to steer the conversation into another direction. There was this other language I had the same feelings about. It is called Visual Basic. Why? Mainly because I associate Basic with people educated in any topic but computer science. Often these people seem to be hired by software houses that donâ€™t care about the quality of their employees, as long as they can make money out of them. And as long as there are customers that donâ€™t really care about the quality of the software that is written, they get away with it. Mind you, Iâ€™m not saying that you need a degree in computer science to become a good programmer. One of the best programmers Iâ€™ve ever met had an unfinished degree in sociology.\n\nOk, enough of this ranting. Despite my dislike for Visual Basic I downloaded and installed Mono 1.2.3 and the VB compiler yesterday evening. The goal, as usual, is to support yet another programming language for GIMP#. We already have C#, Java, IronPython and now VB is next. I already did some initial experiments and I expect to have a working GIMP plug-in written in VB pretty soon. Some minor problems so far:\n\nas advertised, the vnbc compiler is pretty basic yet. Error messages are very cryptic which makes it sometimes hard to find the real error.\n\nit seems that VB doesnâ€™t have the yield keyword. So writing a custom Enumerator takes a bit more code ðŸ˜¦\n\nI felt kinda dirty after having written a few lines of Visual Basicâ€¦\n\nI hope to report on the performance of the Average Blur plug-in written in VB, compared to C#, IronPython and Java soon."
