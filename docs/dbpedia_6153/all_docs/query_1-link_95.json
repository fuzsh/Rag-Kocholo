        "text": "What is the GIMP\n\nGIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching & image composition and image authoring.\n\nGIMP is written and developed primarily on GNU/Linux and runs best under X11 on that platform, or varieties of UNIX. It is also available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.\n\nThe GIMP at GUADEC\n\nGIMP related talks at GUADEC\n\nOther graphics talks at GUADEC\n\nTypography and graphic design for programmers\n\nLiam Quin\n\nThe future of rendering in GNOME\n\nOwen Taylor\n\nGStreamer Internals\n\nBenjamin Otte\n\nDigital Photography in a GNOME Environment\n\nHubert Figui√©re\n\nSponsors\n\nGIMP conference activities\n\nThe GIMP Developers Conference, also known as GIMPCon, is a gathering of GIMP and GEGL developers from all over the World. It is a vital opportunity for the GIMP developers to meet each other and discuss the direction which the software will take over the coming years.\n\nThere have been two GIMP Conferences previously, both in Berlin, and both graciously hosted by the CCC (the Chaos Computer Club), a much less chaotic bunch of guys than their name suggests.\n\nLast year's GIMP Conference was a sub-event of the Chaos Communications Camp, a camping trip with broadband and laptops. During the camp, we discussed ways we could make the GIMP better both technically and as a community, which led up to the 2.0 release at the end of March.\n\nAt this year's conference we will discuss, among other things,\n\nWhat we expect from a replacement for the PDB (Procedural Database)\n\nHow we will integrate GEGL into the GIMP\n\nManaging plug-in distribution\n\nThe GIMP's organisation\n\nThe GIMP, Live!\n\nTwo of our resident graphics designers, Jakub Steiner (jimmac) and Tuomas Kuosmanen (tigert) are giving a user-day GIMP demonstration on Wednesday. Last year, jimmac presented a series of tutorials on basic GIMP techniques to a crowd of over 100 people, and held them captivated for nearly 3 hours.\n\nThis is an opportunity to see what the GIMP can do in the hands of professionals, and to pick up some tips for your own use. A spectacle not to be missed.\n\nAbout the GIMP\n\nStarted in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, the GIMP has evolved into a mature and powerful application. The current release is version 2.0, which has major improvements over its predecessors in the user interface, making the GIMP more accessible for casual users as well as graphics professionals.\n\nGIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions which allow access to its capabilties via a number of languages. The advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.\n\nThe software comes with lots of features, some are newly implemented and available with the 2.0 Release. A short list over the most interesting features are:"
