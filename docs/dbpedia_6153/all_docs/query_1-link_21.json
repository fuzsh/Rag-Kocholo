The safest thing is to use only Free as in Libre fonts and brushes under a GPL or CC model license for production work. You might find everything you need here:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/\n\nYou can also use the GIMP to make brushes of your very own:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/gimp-brushes-tutorial http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Custom_Brushes/ http://tinyurl.com/vector2brush\n\nBack to the worm can, \"I am not a lawyer\" but I do not consider any font or brush susceptible to copyright safe to use, unless I can prove that a \"free\" license has been applied to it by its original creator, or have in my possession a receipt from its original creator clearly spelling out my rights to use the thing. As a matter of personal policy, I don't use \"non-free\" tools when an alternative exists.\n\nI have not heard of any publishers demanding to see the licenses for tools used in preparing submitted art. But if some \"IP broker\" recognizes a font or brush they charge rent for in your work, they might demand to see your license, and attempt to extort thousands of dollars out of you if you can't show have a receipt for a license to use their poisoned candy.\n\n:o)\n\nSteve"
