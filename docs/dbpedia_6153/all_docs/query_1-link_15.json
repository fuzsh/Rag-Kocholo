In reading the License Agreement, I wasn't sure I could use my own creations commercially. \"Legaleze\" isn't really my forte.\n\nIf you look in the help menu, under \"about this application\",you'll find the license item. In that item, you'll see that Gimp is made available under version 3 of the General Public License.\n\nOn this page:\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\n\nin section 0 it says that a covered work is the program, or a work based on the program. It would include parts of the program.\n\nIn addition to source code, the program includes some images, such as the widgets in the toolbox palette and the Gimp mascot. If you use the Gimp to edit those images and want to publish the results, you would need to publish them under the GPL.\n\nBut I assume you are not doing that. It's a rather unusual thing to do.\n\nIf you take a picture of your dog with your digital camera, that is not part of the program. And if you edit the picture of your dog with the Gimp, that is still not part of the program. It's your dog and your work, so the image is yours.\n\nThe Gimp is a tool, and the license covers the tool, but not the stuff you make or alter with the tool, except when you work on the Gimp itself with the Gimp like the developers do.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nThanks so much, I appreciate any clarifications you can provide.\n\nCarol\n\nJoel Rees I'm imagining I'm a novelist: http://joel-rees-economics.blogspot.com/2017/01/soc500-00-00-toc.html More of my delusions: http://reiisi.blogspot.jp/p/novels-i-am-writing.html\n\nHi Carol,\n\nAs one who has designed and created books commercially, I suggest that you make the acquaintance of a lawyer who is willing to provide professional advice at low cost for a struggling artist.\n\nThere are many issues surrounding ownership, copyright, reproduction rights, getting paid, etc. Young designers are always complaining about legal problems they have run into and they are always asked: \"Do you have a contract? Do you know a lawyer?\" and the answer is always, \"No\". By then it's too late. The publishing world can be a minefield for the unwary. Your question shows you are attuned to this.\n\nLastly, be very, very, *very* careful about the agreements you sign with the DIY self-publishers, or any publisher. Some of them try to get you to sign agreements which are NOT in your best interest. Ask your friendly lawyer to review any contract or agreement FIRST, before you sign it. Your creative work needs all the protection it can get.\n\nCheers, Rick S.\n\n-----Original Message----- From: Carol Perkins\n\nSent: Tuesday, March 28, 2017 4:10 PM To: gimp-user-list@gnome.org\n\nSubject: [Gimp-user] Who Owns Images Created Using Gimp Tool\n\nHi,\n\nI've viewed some the tutorials for the Gimp tool, covering various features.

The EULA of the early MS-C compiler had something like this (MS considered that since you linked their runtime, your program contained MS code) but this was pulled fairly quickly when corporate customers sent in their lawyers.\n\nGetting a little off-topic, but did you know that the EULA for Microsoft Word Viewer (at least the 2007 version I looked at) does not allow you to view files created by non-Microsoft software?\n\n\"a. General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices. You may use the software only to view and print files created with Microsoft Office software. You may not use the software for any other purpose.\"\n\nBut if someone sent you a \".doc\" file, how would you know if it had been created by Microsoft Word, or LibreOffice, say?\n\nBob Long"
