In the unlikely event that language detection fails, or if you just want to use a different language, you may do so:\n\nLinux\n\nIn LINUX: in console mode, type LANGUAGE=en gimp or LANG=en gimp replacing en by fr, de, ... according to the language you want. Background: Using LANGUAGE=en sets an environment variable for the executed program gimp.\n\nWindows XP\n\nControl Panel → System → Advanced → Environment button in “System Variables” area: Add button: Enter LANG for Name and fr or de... for Value. Watch out! You have to click on three successive OK to validate your choice.\n\nIf you change languages often, you can create a batch file to change the language. Open NotePad. Type the following commands (for french for instance):\n\nset lang=fr\n\nstart gimp-2.6.exe\n\nSave this file as GIMP-FR.BAT (or another name, but always with a .BAT extension). Create a shortcut and drag it to your desktop.\n\nAnother possibility: Start → Programs → GTK Runtime Environment Then Select language and select the language you want in the dropdown list.\n\nApple Mac OS X\n\nFrom System Preferences, click on the International icon. In the Language tab, the desired language should be the first in the list.\n\nAnother GIMP instance\n\nUse -n to run multiple instances GIMP. For example, use gimp-2.6 to start GIMP in the default system language, and LANGUAGE=en gimp-2.6 -n to start another instance of GIMP in English; this is very useful for translators.\n\n[unquote]\n\nRon\n\nhttp://tuxvoid.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-change-gimp-language-setting.html\n\n[quote]\n\nhow to change gimp language setting:\n\nAfter changing some regional and language settings in my vista to Japanese, if I run gimp, it displays unreadable character instead of English. I found this url is very helpful to change the language of gimp (in XP, Linux, and MacOSX):\n\nhttp://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-fire-up.html#gimp-concepts-running-language\n\nFor vista, it is very similar with XP, example is to use English (en):\n\n(1) go to control panel, system, advanced system settings\n\n(2) click Environment variables..\n\n(3) add new environment variable (click New...):\n\nvariable name: LANG\n\nvariable value: en\n\n(4) ok. finish.\n\n[/quote]"
