During that time he lived in South Africa, Thailand and most recently in Japan. Some highlights off the court include climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal. A native New Yorker, Samuel received his MA and BA in English from Columbia University and currently lives in Bedford with his son. Love 30 is his first book."
