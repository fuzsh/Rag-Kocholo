To earn the right to survive, they must become more efﬁcient, more accountable, and more useful to both students and society. We have been here before. In the early twentieth century, a powerful cohort of elite reformers operating under the mantle of philanthropy worked in sync to transform American higher education. They called for sweeping changes in the sector and raised existential questions about its sustainability. And while they fell short of their goals, they left indelible marks on the sector. Because of these reformers, we can speak of an American system of higher education, and we can recognize core components of that system that they introduced: the community college, the ﬂagship university, extension services, and much more. We can also recognize ideas that the reformers brought into the system: that higher education must be efﬁcient and practical, that it must be accountable to the public interest (expressed through government and foundations), that funding can be sought from sources other than students and alumni, and that colleges and universities exist within a self-evident status hierarchy that helps organize American society. But that’s not all. We can also speak of infrastructure and ideas that emerged out of a broad resistance to the reformers. That resistance came from a coalition of academics, religious leaders, journalists, politicians, and advocates for marginalized communities, and from hundreds of lowstatus higher education institutions that felt threatened by top-down reform. They established protective interinstitutional associations and the accreditation process, and they preserved the universal liberal arts curriculum. They also enshrined ideas like academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and the distinctive openness of American higher education—\n\n2 : in troduction\n\nthe notion that any student can aspire to earn a bachelor’s degree and that any institution can aspire to elite status. In this book, I examine all of these effects and many more. I also offer an in-depth view of the people who led the charge for reform, the organizations they formed to pursue it, the people who opposed them, and the schools that served as the objects of both a ﬁerce disputation and, eventually, a new consensus about the role of higher education in American society. The policies and initiatives I analyze here came from outside of the campus bubble. Many scholars have recognized that contestation has been a key shaper of educational institutions; here, I argue emphatically for the importance of external contestation in the formative years of American higher education. And by that adjective, I mean not just external to individual campuses but external to the larger community of colleges and universities. My intervention is to show that long before the modern era, the sea of institutional inﬂuences on higher education—the sector’s “organizational ﬁeld”—included external actors like foundations, the business community, and the state.1 Campus politics matter, but external ideas and programs, often tied to money or status, have been the primary drivers of reform. The ideas and programs, as well as the money and status, came primarily from two philanthropic foundations that typically show up as side notes in the historiography of higher education. However, their signiﬁcance is enormous. The wealthiest and most inﬂuential capitalists in history endowed them with the modern-day equivalent of billions of dollars; they received the blessings of the federal government; the leaders of the nation’s most elite universities oversaw them; and a groundswell of enmity and resistance rose up against them. And more: these were the ﬁrst true foundations in history. They established not only the idea that the nonproﬁt sector could have an agenda for higher education but that it could have an agenda about anything. The fact that the initiatives these foundations pushed did not work out as planned does not make them any less important. Their failure, despite tremendous wealth and power, is important in and of itself. To that end, this book offers two core contributions. The ﬁrst is the surprising history of how a tight-knit group of reformers precipitated so much of what we take for granted about higher education today. The second is an implicit message of faith to people and institutions today who fear external topdown reform as a novel existential threat. Yes, it poses a challenge, but it is not new, and it is not unyielding. This type of reform has been a part\n\nin troduction : 3\n\nof American higher education for more than a century, and colleges and universities have long since found ways to live with it, assimilate it, divert it, and subvert it.\n\nThe Narrative What follows plays out over a three-part chronological arc, comprising an early period in which ideas about higher education reform were emerging (1890–1905); a pivotal “crucible of reform” when the foundations were established and had their greatest effect (1905–1915); and an extended period in which the initiatives launched in the previous decade were either beaten back or assimilated into a new consensus that emerged among the reformers and their many detractors (1915–1936). The three sections of the book only tenuously follow the timeline, however; sections one and two focus on the reformers’ ideas and efforts up through 1920 while section three focuses on the resistance to reform that emerged around 1908. The events that drive this book’s narrative depended on four contingent conditions that were in place before 1890, only one of which had direct implications for education. The ﬁrst was the accumulation and disbursement of Gilded Age wealth. The reformers were bankrolled by the Carnegie and Rockefeller fortunes: unprecedented accumulations of private money that demanded to be spent on something beyond personal luxury.2 The second and third contingencies were the rise of two bodies of ideas that appealed to the nouveau riche: a nationwide obsession with industrialization, especially expressed through the emerging ﬁeld of engineering, and a movement to reshape society along supposedly scientiﬁc lines—a project commonly described as “social Darwinism.” 3 These circumstances and interests created a classic “solution in search of a problem.”4 Rich people had newly found money, and they wanted to use it to apply engineering logic to social issues. That solution would eventually ﬁnd many problems, but the ﬁrst one it settled on emerged out of the fourth contingency: the success of the nineteenth-century common school movement, followed by the success of the high school movement, which created a swell of educated young people, including women, immigrants, and minoritized racial and ethnic communities.5 These new entrants wanted to go to college, and hundreds of colleges across the land were eager to give them that chance. But the reformers had different ideas. On that note, the battles I describe in this book were waged over the second part of that dyad: institutions, not students. The big foundations sought to cull the herd of American colleges, to limit their revenue and\n\n4 : in troduction\n\nambitions, and to curb their degree offerings. Those restrictions, of course, would necessarily constrain the opportunities available to students, especially new entrants. But the reformers never dwelled on this fact. In return, when resistance emerged at the end of the crucible of reform, it came in defense of institutions, especially low-status ones. These colleges, of course, served low-status students, but again, students were rarely the object of resistance. Targeting institutions let the reformers seem less heartless and more businesslike, which suited their origins and their conception of the world. This is the theme of my book’s ﬁrst section, two chapters that document the ethos of reform. I open with an overview of the reformist cohort, who were inﬂuenced both by the business orientation of their benefactors and by the logic of engineering, which was itself informing American business. Because of this, I call the reformers the “academic engineers.”6 Borrowing the language and ethos of engineering, these individuals were united in their desire to reshape the landscape of American colleges and universities into a coherent system governed by efﬁciency and tended by “expert” managers (i.e., themselves). Their mechanisms to do so were two philanthropic foundations explicitly set up for higher education reform and backed by money derived from engineering-dependent businesses: the General Education Board (GEB), endowed by John D. Rockefeller, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT), endowed by Andrew Carnegie. Those philanthropists never went to college. The academic engineers who ran their foundations typically did, but those administrators also positioned themselves as external to American higher education. We can often spot the academic engineers by their self-styled “outsider” status, pointing to their humble origins on the periphery of nineteenth-century American society or, conversely, to their experience in Europe, especially graduate study in German universities. Their externality was further cemented by their use of the foundations as devices for top-down control. Even though many of the academic engineers were the presidents of elite universities, when they met together as the GEB or the CFAT board, they were not making decisions for their exclusive club but rather for the hundreds of lower-status schools without seats at the table. Furthermore, others had no formal connections to higher education. Like Carnegie and Rockefeller, they were purportedly disinterested reformers who chose to focus their energy on changing colleges. In addition to framing the cohort, in the ﬁrst\n\nin troduction : 5\n\nchapter I explain the origins of the two intertwined foundations and offer portraits of some exemplary academic engineers. The second chapter examines the overarching goals of the academic engineers’ reform project: establishing normative and coercive control over colleges and universities and using that control to reduce their numbers and maximize efﬁciency. Their ideas came directly from the prevailing economic theory of the turn of the twentieth century, which maintained that market-based competition was wasteful and potentially ruinous. The answer, both in business and in the foundations’ plans for higher education, was systemization and centralized control. The reformers’ strategies toward these goals included picking winners and losers among colleges, encouraging consolidation between neighboring institutions, and creating a new institution called the “junior college” (today’s community college) to serve as a consolation prize for “loser” schools. They also fought against existing systems of control, especially the religious denominations that had oversight over most private colleges at the turn of the century. The book’s next section comprises three chapters on the program of reform. Here, I show how the academic engineers tried to shape a system by promoting and demoting colleges, how they boosted sub-baccalaureate institutions in the name of “practical” postsecondary education for the masses, and how they tried to limit the educational prospects of women, religious and ethnic minorities, and people of color. In the ﬁrst of these chapters, I focus on the academic engineers’ efforts to build systemic hierarchies, which they viewed as mechanisms to cement efﬁciency and noncompetition between colleges and universities. A hallmark of these imagined hierarchies was the limitation of university status, and even baccalaureate status, to the top tiers of an institutional pyramid. The ﬁrst half of the chapter examines national or regional-level reform projects in the name of this idea, including the use of the federal bureaucracy or a proposed National University to exert top-down control from Washington. The second half turns to case studies of four states— Mississippi, Ohio, California, and Iowa—in which the reformers and their allies attempted to establish formal institutional hierarchies, with varying degrees of failure. The fourth chapter continues the theme of limiting access to the more esteemed parts of higher education (especially the bachelor’s degree) but turns away from the academic engineers’ efforts to delimit existing institutions. My focus here is the reformers’ promotion of new types of “practical” postsecondary schooling. I analyze several of these new or newly\n\n6 : in troduction\n\nembraced forms: normal schools, land-grant colleges, junior colleges, university extension divisions, and technical schools. All of these owed a debt to highly visible ideas in adult education, including manual training and the Chautauqua movement, as well as to the translation of the harsher implications of social Darwinism into the less threatening assertion that not all students are “college material.” In the ﬁfth chapter, I show how that assertion was a real threat after all, especially when it was applied to marginalized students. I explain how the academic engineering agenda played out for women, religious minorities, African Americans, and Appalachians. In each case, the reformers sought to exclude the bulk of students from these groups from accessing mainstream higher education and instead tried to redirect them to subbaccalaureate schools. This chapter marks the narrative’s turning point by showing how members of those marginalized groups pushed back on the reformers and began to gain the privileges that had been denied to them because of their backgrounds and identities. That shift leads into the book’s ﬁnal section, three chapters that present an account of the decline of reform. Here, I explain the wave of resistance that rose up against the academic engineers, the creation of organizations designed to claw away power from the foundations, and the surprising consensus about the form and function of higher education that emerged by the 1930s. The sixth chapter explains the widespread hostility to academic engineering that ﬁrst became apparent in 1908. It came from many sectors: religious leaders, proponents of local control, professors, journalists, defenders of liberal arts colleges, defenders of Black colleges, and students (especially students at Black colleges). This pushback was disorganized but highly visible, and it effectively raised public scrutiny of the reformers and set the stage for their fall from power and prominence. In the seventh chapter, I show how informal resistance became organized deﬁance around 1915. A number of organizations formed almost simultaneously, each of them seeking either to directly challenge the academic engineers or to claw back authority from them. These included the Association of American Colleges; the American Association of University Professors; groups of normal schools, women’s colleges, Black colleges, and junior colleges; and regional accreditation bodies. None of these groups brought down the reformers, but they forced them to make concessions, give up programs, and come to the table of compromise (which in part took the form of a new umbrella association: the American Council on Education).\n\nin troduction : 7\n\nThe book’s ﬁnal chapter describes the end of academic engineering, which sustained some direct blows at the end of the crucible of reform but did not truly leave the scene until the end of a long fade in the ’20s and early ’30s. I explain what happened to the GEB and the CFAT as well as to the various types of colleges they sought to repress. I also describe the novel consensus that emerged out of the battles of the previous decades: that social efﬁciency and liberal learning could be bedfellows and that a liberal education at an autonomous institution was the ideal locus for crafting economically productive, democratic citizens. This new consensus came with a new ethos. Instead of efﬁciency, higher education in the decades following 1936 would be organized around “uplift”: the idea that going to college could improve people and that therefore it was wrong to limit anyone’s ambition—either the ambition of a student to earn a bachelor’s degree or the ambition of a postsecondary institution to offer bachelor’s degrees.\n\nFour Conversations With this book, I hope to contribute to four bodies of literature. The ﬁrst is the most obvious: the history of American higher education. Many of the events and individuals I discuss will be familiar to my fellow historians. Certainly the decades around the turn of the twentieth century have been described as pivotal by many of the seminal books in the ﬁeld.7 But I am telling a different version of the story. Much has been written about how William Rainey Harper shaped the University of Chicago, how Nicholas Murray Butler shaped Columbia, and how Woodrow Wilson shaped Princeton. Those stories are important, but they do not reﬂect the external contestation at the heart of my argument. I am much more interested in Harper’s involvement with Kalamazoo College, Butler’s with Seth Low Junior College, Wilson’s with Berea College, and in the GEB’s and the CFAT’s involvement with hundreds of other lower-tier institutions. This book is also not about what John Thelin calls the “reform contingents [who] were comparable to teams of termites, each working industriously beneath the surface of campus life to topple the dominant structures.”8 My focus is external reform, speciﬁcally top-down reform. While I detail many bottom-up efforts that emanated from students, professors, and the leaders of low-status institutions, they are examples of people trying to preserve or grow their institutions, not fundamentally transform them. Furthermore, much of the historiography of American higher education is predominantly the history of Chicago, Columbia, Princeton, and\n\n8 : in troduction\n\nother elite universities. There is no doubt that these places are enormously important, but as Philo Hutcheson argues, paring the study of American higher education to “the mission and structure of the research university is using Occam’s razor far too quickly.”9 This book centers on non-elite institutions including technical schools, teachers colleges, land-grant institutions, historically Black colleges, community colleges, and low-tier liberal arts colleges.10 These schools, and the regional public universities that evolved from some of them, educate the vast majority of today’s college students. The history of higher education is, largely, their history.11 I am also intervening by suppressing the sagas of speciﬁc colleges and universities and instead pursuing what Thelin calls the “horizontal history” of higher education.12 There are many case studies of individual institutions in this book, but my focus is always on how they responded to the incentives and pressures placed upon them by external actors that operated on a national scale. In taking a broad view of higher education’s organizational ﬁeld, I am also building on David Levine’s examination of the growth of college-going before World War II. Levine also offers an analysis of non-elite colleges and universities and how they interacted with the rapidly changing American economy and society. However, Levine focuses on informal processes of stratiﬁcation, whereas this book is about formal efforts to control institutions and create a policy-based stratiﬁcation. Also, Levine starts the story in 1915, based on a mistaken claim that prior to then “public attention was rarely focused on the colleges” and that higher education did not “play a prominent role in the development of American society” until World War I.13 While their undergraduate enrollments were still very modest by today’s standards, I will show in this book just how much attention and prominence colleges and universities commanded before the war. The big foundations were the ones driving that attention, but in the historiography of higher education they have often been treated as a curiosity that had little effect; recent surveys typically give them just a few pages of notice.14 And yet, a look at the archives of just about any American college or university from the early twentieth century, especially between 1905 and 1915, will reveal a ﬂurry of activity related to the foundations.15 In the case of elite institutions, the activity is there typically because their leaders sat on the CFAT or GEB boards or at least were working in sync with them. In the case of low-status institutions, the activity is about jockeying for money or recognition from the foundations or about pushing back on their agenda. Why so little notice for the foundations? History, supposedly, is written\n\nin troduction : 9\n\nby the winners, and the academic engineers were not winners. Despite their eye-popping wealth and prominence, the bulk of their reforms did not work as intended, and many were abandoned by the 1920s. Most historians have instead focused on more successful reforms in the areas of graduate and professional education as well as on the rapid development of the research function in American universities.16 Two important books do deal directly with the foundations, although neither attempts to cover as much territory as I am attempting here. Ellen Lagemann’s Private Power for the Public Good is a close examination of the CFAT, commissioned by the foundation itself.17 While it is very objective and even critical, it deals with the CFAT largely in isolation and not as part of a national movement; Lagemann barely mentions the GEB, for example, despite its obvious alignment with the book’s subject. Clyde Barrow’s Universities and the Capitalist State (1990) examines both foundations and analyzes their national-level reform agenda but does so from a hypercritical Marxist standpoint and focuses on reforms that targeted the professoriate, a theme that is only tangential to my narrative.18 My focus on the foundations lends this book to a second scholarly conversation: the study of philanthropy. One of the major ﬁndings of this project is the extent to which higher education reform was integral to the formal organization of the philanthropic foundation itself.19 At the heart of my story are two entities that were the very ﬁrst examples of the classic twentieth-century foundation, with a permanent endowment, central ofﬁces in New York, and full-time executives and program ofﬁcers who oversaw a wide variety of grants and initiatives across the entire nation. (Both also held congressional charters, which makes them particularly distinctive.) This origin story is little noted by scholars who study philanthropy, even historically, who tend to focus on the larger foundations established in the next decade: the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation.20 The fact that the ﬁrst true foundations were not dedicated to eradicating disease, poverty, or warfare but rather to advancing higher education reform is certainly a surprise. But it helps us understand this novel type of organization as rooted in complex social action rather than simple generosity.21 It also provides a historical basis for the modern critique of private philanthropy as ideological and elite-friendly rather than unqualiﬁedly benevolent.22 The immense controversy and pushback that the academic engineers inspired also set the stage for a century of debates over who gets to direct civil society, how to balance the demands and promises of the “third sector” (i.e., the nonproﬁt sphere) with the market and the state, and how to balance all three with the interests of the nonsector: the people.\n\n10 : i n t r o d u c t i o n\n\nMy examination of that balancing act also speaks to a third ﬁeld, focused on historical political analysis. Commonly termed “American political development,” this line of inquiry often focuses on the early twentieth century as an era in which various forms of governance, both state and nonstate, were created or transformed in the United States. The ﬁeld goes beyond studying the basic interactions of these institutions with society, to what Karen Orren and Stephen Skowronek call “intercurrence,” in which “several different sets of rules and norms are likely to be operating simultaneously.”23 This type of analysis is useful in studying the development of higher education, as historically minded sociologists have pointed out.24 American colleges and universities and their would-be reformers were enmeshed in multiple overlapping political arenas in the early twentieth century. One of these was the most visible arena of all: electoral politics. The best example of this was the astonishing rise of Woodrow Wilson. History books list “governor of New Jersey” as his prior occupation before the presidency, but he was in that position for less than a year before he launched his bid for the White House. Instead, his national prominence came from his presidency of Princeton and his reputation as a passionate, if unsuccessful, higher education reformer.25 Equally astonishingly, the vice-presidential nominee on the Republican ticket opposing Wilson in 1912 was Nicholas Murray Butler, the sitting president of Columbia University. Until a few months prior, the two men had served together on the CFAT board. But my narrative’s connection to American political development goes well beyond the ballot box. Historians have recently started approaching both K–12 education26 and higher education27 as integral components of nation-building in the United States, showing how the sectors served simultaneously as instruments of the layered American state and as shapers of that state. This book reﬂects Padgett and Ansell’s concept of “robust action,” centering the role of powerful elites in brokering alliances and shaping the form of social and political institutions.28 The philanthropists and the academic engineers they enabled recognized higher education as a potential fulcrum for lifting the nation’s economy and society into the modern, rational ideal they envisioned for the new century, and they threw their wealth and energy into its reform.29 Some of that reform was meant to be prosecuted by ofﬁcial state actors, like the federal Bureau of Education, but when those actors fell short, the foundations (blessed by Congress and operating on a national scale) stepped in. Additionally, as an extension of the nation-building idea, higher education served as a point of international comparison. The reformers I study constantly invoked a\n\ni n t r o d u c t i o n : 11\n\nrace (ﬁrst friendly, then hostile) with Germany in which educational efforts were central. Some of the largest exhibits in the US pavilion at the 1904 World’s Fair were focused on colleges and universities, in a proud display of their critical importance in the coming “American century.”30 In short, the individuals and organizations at the heart of my story were not just reckoning with the form and function of higher education; they were reckoning with the form and function of the United States. And they were absolutely aware of this fact. The ﬁnal scholarly conversation to which I hope to contribute is about higher education once again—not just its history but also its essential nature. While many of their reforms failed, the ideas and debates that the academic engineers launched did not die in 1936. I do not make many explicit comparisons to contemporary phenomena here, but today’s discourse about the form and function of higher education certainly has many echoes of the discourse that I describe in this book. It also can be mapped onto other periods of history, especially the 1960s, when a new interest in systemic reorganization swept over the sector. As such, this book ﬁts into a contemporary body of work that interrogates higher education reform from a variety of angles. Some of this literature explicitly advocates reform, citing inefﬁciencies and shortcomings in student outcomes, institutional and systemic organization, costs to students and taxpayers, and beneﬁts to society.31 Other authors celebrate the status quo and criticize the notion that American higher education needs reform in terms of either structure32 or curriculum.33 A third category contends that the reform has already happened, with deleterious results.34 As a historical study, this book does not ﬁt into any of these categories, and it certainly does not take a normative stance. Instead, it serves as a corrective to the idea that the elite impulse to reform American higher education is a new one. One hundred years ago, similar camps engaged in a similar set of debates. This does not mean that the current moment is any less of an opportunity, or any less of a threat, than its participants believe it to be. But my demonstration of the academic engineers’ many failures and the novel consensus that replaced their vision by the 1930s should be instructive. Top-down design is not destiny. Design matters, and so does power, but they are not irrepressible. The American higher education system, wildly successful and maddeningly disappointing at the same time, is not the direct product of anyone’s design or anyone’s power. It is not the product of organic development, either. It is the product of contests and compromises, attacks and counterattacks, ideas and exigencies.\n\npa rt on e\n\nThe Ethos of Reform\n\n1: t he aca demic engin eer s\n\nAlthough it is not an intellectual history, this is a book about ideas. The reformers at the heart of the narrative were brimming with them. The ideas did not originate on college campuses. They were in wide circulation in the turn-of-the-century United States, and they were applied to many contexts, not just higher education. Throughout the book, and especially at chapter beginnings, I will describe impactful ideas from many sources— economics, politics, constitutional law, social science, race relations—that informed higher education reform as well as counter-reform. The academic engineers worked hard to make those ideas their own. In their quest to fundamentally restructure the higher education sector, they borrowed the ideas and then conducted surveys, wrote detailed reports, drew elaborate graphs, and created detailed statistical tables to back them up. This was not neutral research; they knew the answers before they started. Then, they published those answers constantly, in every available format: through the academic journals that were then becoming the gold standard for knowledge dissemination and in books, white papers, and highbrow periodicals like The Atlantic, The Outlook, and The North American Review. Although they also used their considerable wealth and inﬂuence to actively pursue programmatic reform, they spent much of their time practicing pragmatism: feeding back to the world the ideas that they had borrowed, gussied up with data, and applied to higher education. Conveniently, this aids the historian’s task in understanding the reformers’ theory of action; the academic engineers were not shy with their ideas. A warning: at many times in this book, I will take unfair shortcuts. One is the suggestion that all of the academic engineers shared the same ideas. That was never true; they often disagreed with each other and sometimes even worked at cross-purposes. But they did share an ethos. As I will show in this chapter and the next, that ethos had three parts. First, they believed that American higher education represented a problem to be solved. Second, they thought the solution to that problem would come from outsiders—people who were not loyal to the status quo and brought\n\n16 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\na novel perspective to the situation. Third, they thought that core concepts from the newly emerging ﬁeld of engineering were the best ways to measure and improve higher education, ﬁrst among them efﬁciency and systemization. I will also take the related unfair shortcut of referring to the academic engineers as a uniﬁed cohort. This was also not true. Even though their most prominent members sat on either the GEB or the CFAT board or both, others operated only in loose connection to the big foundations, or even on their own. Most drifted in and out of the movement throughout the period under study here, although all were active at some point during the crucible of reform from 1905 to 1915. Still, the reformers functioned as what Upton Sinclair, one of their most prominent critics, called an “interlocking directorate.”1 They sat on boards and daises together, traveled and socialized together, supported each other’s causes and wrote each other’s biographies. They did not share a mind, but they shared an agenda as well as the communicational and organizational tools to carry it out.\n\nid e n t i f yi ng th e ac a dem i c engi neer s The reformers were critics, ﬁrst and foremost. The ﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century were marked by what Michael McGerr succinctly calls “a ﬁerce discontent” about the disorganized nature of American society.2 While it is hard for us to understand the discontent of people who were generally very privileged (to say nothing of their ludicrously wealthy benefactors), their focus on higher education is a clue to their goals. Progressive Era reform, a broad movement, was a top-down effort to bring order to the United States. The reformers’ goal, McGerr argues, was “to remake the nation’s feuding, polyglot population in their own middle class image.”3 In one sense, the reformers in this book saw educational institutions as instruments in that remaking; schools could do the work of socializing students and equipping them for a new era of national life. But they also saw the institutions themselves as a “feuding, polyglot population.” The academic engineers believed that higher education had an important role to play in nation-building, but ﬁrst the nation’s hundreds of heterogeneous colleges and universities had to get their act together. We can ﬁnd versions of this discontent in many Progressive Era reform efforts, especially elsewhere in the education sector. Historians have long since identiﬁed a distinct cohort of reformers active in K–12 education in the early twentieth century, most memorably described by David Tyack as\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 17\n\nthe “administrative progressives.”4 Tyack’s analysis builds on Raymond Callahan’s, which explains how the United States’ emerging “business society” demanded that public schools be administered with the same type of efﬁciency-minded management that was becoming de rigueur in the corporate world.5 Callahan’s analysis is mostly conﬁned to the curriculum and internal dynamics of schools, whereas Tyack focuses his attention on administration: the consolidation and centralization of school districts and the installation of ostensibly expert and nonpartisan administrators and school boards. David Labaree picks up on this difference, arguing that administrative progressivism was “a movement aimed at the formal structure of schooling and not at the instructional core.”6 That description also applies to the academic engineers, who rarely bothered with details like instruction. While Tyack is clear about the detrimental effects of the administrative progressives’ reforms, especially the relegation of students from impoverished or minority communities to a second-class form of schooling, he took care to point out that these individuals saw themselves as making positive, forward-looking changes. Their touchpoint was the world of American business, which was, of course, a tremendous success story at the turn of the twentieth century. They railed about “accountability” and “wished to emulate the process of decision-making used by men of the board of directors of a modern business corporation.” Tyack describes them as an “interlocking directorate” of “liberal industrialists” and “civic-minded elites” who were willing to spend their own money to build schools, conduct research, and sponsor political efforts to fulﬁll their vision of reform.7 Again, the description closely matches the academic engineers. There are other parallels between the two groups, and some individuals were clearly members of both.8 But there was a key difference in their agendas, beyond their interest in different educational levels. The K–12 reformers almost exclusively focused on local or state-level efforts. The higher education reformers dreamed of national-level reform. Commensurately, the ideas and the ethos that undergirded the academic engineers’ efforts were grander in scope and more passionately invoked. So, how do we spot an academic engineer? They had three identifying features, none of them deﬁnitive on their own: their affiliations, their positionality, and their principles. (In Appendix A, I list ﬁfty-three academic engineers, most of whom shared all three signiﬁers.) Afﬁliations are the simplest clue. The GEB and the CFAT were organizations with explicit mandates for systemic higher education reform; being a\n\n18 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nmember of their boards or their staffs prior to 1920 was a pretty sure sign that you were an academic engineer. It was not a lock; in chapter eight I will describe members who served as counterweights on those boards and eventually helped bring the reform movement to a close. Foundation membership was also not a requirement. Many people were academic engineers but lacked the prominence to be afﬁliated with the big foundations. Others were excluded from the boards because of their race or gender. At least two people are ﬁrmly identiﬁable as academic engineers due to their prominence, position, and principles and would have surely joined one or both boards if they had been white men: Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute and M. Carey Thomas of Bryn Mawr College. Positionality is more abstract. The academic engineers were self-styled outsiders. Their goal was to reform the mainstream of American higher education, and they emphasized that they were not part of that mainstream. This ostensibly made them disinterested parties, in alignment with Progressive Era ideals about management by neutral “experts.” One hallmark of outsider status was an education that took part literally outside of the United States. Speciﬁcally, many academic outsiders had attended graduate school in Germany. In the late nineteenth century, German universities were considered the best in the world. Nearly ten thousand Americans traveled to them to study, in some cases earning PhDs, which were not yet commonly offered in the United States.9 Many of them returned as reformers, claiming their knowledge of a supposedly more modern postsecondary system as expertise. Sinclair, their antagonist, was well aware of this fact and spat it back in their faces in the aftermath of World War I. After deriding their elitist dogma, he explained, “One after another of these academic drill-sergeants—Butler of Columbia, Berlin—Lowell of Harvard, Berlin—Smith of Pennsylvania, Goettingen . . . Angell of Yale, Berlin—Wheeler of California, Heidelberg—Wilbur of Stanford, Frankfurt and Munich—every one of them learned the Goose-step under the Kaiser!”10 The other type of outsider positionality came from the opposite end of the social spectrum: an origin on the margins of American society. Many academic engineers had humble childhoods, and they invoked this to distinguish themselves from an entrenched Eastern Seaboard higher education establishment that was wedded to the status quo. This old guard was absolutely a straw man—plenty of people who opposed reform had modest origins, too—but the distinction was a powerful one, not least because it helped connect the reformers with their famous benefactors. Carnegie had been a working-class immigrant with a grade-school educa-\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 19\n\ntion, and Rockefeller had been born into poverty in far-upstate New York. Although the industrialists do not ﬁt in the academic engineering category themselves because higher education reform was merely a side project for them, the fact that they were throwing their money at the cause despite their humble backgrounds (which did not include college) was symbolically powerful for the movement. The third sign of an academic engineer is principles, derived from engineering. The reformers revered—even fetishized—the discipline, which had been formalized only in the 1880s.11 Engineering furnished the central principles of the effort to reshape the form and function of higher education: systemization, efﬁciency, and utility. “Efﬁciency,” above all, was a ubiquitous buzzword for the reformers. They viewed colleges and universities as engines with inputs and outputs. Efﬁciency meant conserving a low ratio of the former (expenditures, both from philanthropic giving and from tax dollars) to the latter (the production of human capital and useful knowledge). The academic engineers applied the same logic, with even more force, to the nationwide higher education “system.”12 Unlike an early generation of leaders that sought primarily to expand the capacity of American higher education, the academic engineers in many cases thought that the sector had too much capacity, leading to duplication of effort, wasted resources, and something they called “insincerity,” which meant that institutions were not staying in the lanes that the reformers had ordered them into. They believed that top-down control, coercive and normative, was needed to instate an efﬁcient system. And, of course, the reformers believed they should be the ones wielding that control. This, too, was not lost on their contemporary critics, one of whom argued that the academic engineers’ “methods of centralization and outside control” were ruining American higher education.13 But as the academic engineers saw it, all three signiﬁers combined to justify their authority. In their telling, they were disinterested outsiders who had a vision for American higher education and a mandate, expressed through the foundations, to implement it. Wallace Buttrick, a longtime GEB staffer and its eventual president, habitually described his organization as “the layman’s contribution to education.”14 It was a ridiculous statement to make about a board that at times included a half dozen university presidents. But in the strange logic of the Progressive Era, a “layman”—at least an imagined one—with the right ideology was the best possible person to implement reform.\n\n20 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nt he e ng i neeri ng i dea l History best remembers the CFAT for its famous “Bulletin Number Four” on medical education, also known as the Flexner Report (discussed later in this chapter). Less attention is paid to “Bulletin Number Five,” also issued in 1910. It was titled “Academic and Industrial Efﬁciency,” and its author certainly met the deﬁnition of a “layman” when it came to higher education: Morris Llewellyn Cooke, described by his biographer as the archetypal “progressive engineer.”15 Cooke was an engineer with ideas. His ﬁrst ideological inspiration was the “Social Darwinist” philosopher Herbert Spencer, whose works he would read aloud to his wife. (Carnegie was also an ardent disciple of Spencer.16) But he was even more inspired by his neighbor in Philadelphia, Frederick W. Taylor, who became his mentor. After a period of informal study, the most famous engineer of the day chose Cooke as his special assistant when he was elected president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1906. Cooke absorbed Taylor’s immensely popular gospel of “scientiﬁc management” and sought to extend it beyond the factory ﬂoor. As Jean Christie writes, “To lead the way toward social betterment was, in his eyes, both the social responsibility and the professional opportunity of engineers.”17 Engineering was both a set of skills and, as Taylorites argued, a philosophy for the administration of organizations and of society itself. Henry Pritchett, who ran the CFAT for its ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years, explained that “the engineer today is no longer a mere specialist; he is also the executive ofﬁcer, the manager, the agent, the director of great business enterprises.”18 The logic ran both ways: engineers could apply their vision to many different domains in need of reform, but administrators of all stripes, including those (like the academic engineers) who had no training in the discipline, could also pick up the mantle of the engineer whenever it suited them. In 1909, Pritchett wrote to Taylor and asked him to write a report on higher education; Taylor declined but recommended his protégé.19 Cooke promised to be a clear-eyed, impartial judge whose engineering expertise qualiﬁed him to make sweeping judgments about how to reorganize whole sectors of economy and society. In the preface to “Bulletin Number Five,” Pritchett declared that the “standpoint” from which the author had conducted his investigation “is the same which Mr. Cooke takes when he examines a manufacturing concern.” He explained that while the college should be “viewed from a different standpoint than that of factory efﬁciency, it is still true that all large and continuing causes rest upon formal\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 21\n\norganization and upon some assumed machinery of administration. . . . In any event, only good can come to an organization—whether it be commercial, educational, or religious—when a friendly hand turns the light of public scrutiny upon its methods, resources and aims.”20 On behalf of the CFAT, Cooke delivered the goods. His introduction blithely declared that the challenges of American higher education were universal and thus simple: “Every college feels that it has problems unlike, and of greater difﬁculty of solution than, those to be encountered at other colleges. As a matter of fact, from the standpoint of organization, uniformity in collegiate management is a much easier problem than it is in most industries, because in any industry which I know about, the individual plants vary considerably more than do the colleges.”21 That uniformity, however, extended only to the form of the American college and not to its internal or external functioning: Perhaps the most notable feature of collegiate administration is the entire absence of uniformity or accepted standardization. . . . At nearly every institution progress has been made along certain lines, but generally it has been a “lone ﬁght;” one institution doing one thing and another doing another, without any of the mutual help and coöperation which is given in the business world. Indeed, it is not going beyond the facts to say that in the college world there is less real coöperation than one ﬁnds in those industries where competition is the most intense.22\n\nCooke went on to detail numerous sins in institutional management, including an overreliance on faculty committees, an absence of rational ﬁnancial accounting, and the inefﬁcient use of buildings and classrooms. In a particularly memorable chapter titled “The College Teacher as a Producer,” he challenged the practice of professorial tenure as only a true outsider could: “The question is whether the community secures more efﬁciency from college professors by guaranteeing to them as a class a life tenure in their ofﬁces as long as the service of any one of them remains above the level of an inefﬁciency that is notorious, or whether more general efﬁciency would be secured by ﬁxing their tenure at that which obtains in the outside world, that is, guaranteeing to the professor the possession of his chair only so long as he remains the best man obtainable.”23 Cooke was far from the only person applying the rhetoric of industrial efﬁciency to higher education. Clarence F. Birdseye, a prominent New York lawyer and reformer, was blunt in a 1909 lament: “These terrible losses in educational efﬁciency and results come from the unwillingness of the\n\n22 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nAmerican college to learn from and in part to pattern after the American factory.”24 In 1912, a group of actual engineers organized a symposium in Boston on “Scientiﬁc Management and Efﬁciency in College Administration.” Some participants were harsh on leadership: “The manager of the factory knows that he knows nothing about the best way of running a factory and therefore calls in outside expert assistance; the manager of the college thinks he knows it all, and therefore has no need of advice.”25 Others turned to the question of students, acknowledging that the college had some advantages (“It would be to any industrial organization an asset of untold value to have among its employees and esprit de corps at all approaching ‘college spirit’”26) but also pointing out that many students squandered their college years on frivolous pursuits that wrecked their efﬁciency ratios, which were weighted down with heavy inputs in terms of time and tuition. The academic engineers, however, did not think much about students or even about individual administrators. They focused on institutions and systems. In doing so, they patterned themselves after the idealized civil engineer, as described in 1910 by Hugo Münsterberg, a Leipzig-trained Harvard psychologist who ran in the academic engineering circle: “He does not care for that individual who will pass over the bridge or rush through the tunnel. . . . The chance demands of individuals are submerged in the forward striving of all humanity.”27 Pritchett made his submergence of the individual clear in a 1906 speech: In mechanics, the term “efﬁciency” has a deﬁnite and distinct meaning. It is the ratio of useful work performed by a prime motor to the energy expended. A prime motor—or, as the old English phrase better expresses it, a prime mover—is a machine which receives force as supplied by some natural power, as a water wheel, or a steam engine, and modiﬁes it for the purposes of industry. . . . A college is one of the prime movers in our social order. Into it is poured an enormous stream of human energy: the energy of devotion, of high scholarship, of unselﬁsh service, and the potential energy of wealth. . . . But is the college an efﬁcient prime mover in education? Is its product in proportion to the energy poured into it? Is its co-efﬁcient of efﬁciency high or low?28\n\nPritchett would keep asking those questions throughout his career. And the fact that he controlled a huge endowment made his take on the matter particularly salient. Cooke took note of this in his report, explaining that efﬁciency was not just an end in itself but also a way to impress men with\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 23\n\ndeep pockets: “Everyone likes to feel that the money which he devotes to educational and charitable and philanthropic purposes is well expended; and other things being equal, that [institution] which has an organization making possible the highest efﬁciency, will in the long run receive the greatest consideration from such public benefactors.”29\n\nfollow th e m oney Speaking of benefactors, to understand the academic engineers, we need to understand the men who bankrolled them. It is not trivial that the money that would fuel reform came from Rockefeller’s and Carnegie’s massively successful industrial trusts. Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel served as models both for the foundations themselves and for the new vision of what American higher education should look like: national in scope, vertically integrated, optimized for efﬁciency, and managed by experts. Friends of colleges and universities needed to assimilate this ethos if they were to get the funds they so ardently sought. Higher education reform found Rockefeller and Carnegie, and not vice versa. By 1890, the men were nationally famous for being rich and found themselves constantly besieged by friends and strangers alike seeking gifts for various causes. Colleges and universities were very much in the strangers group, and they were very much part of the siege. The institutional form that the two industrialists developed to moderate the cycle of asking and giving, the endowed foundation, predates the establishment of the Rockefeller Foundation (1911) and the Carnegie Corporation (1913), their two massive general-purpose philanthropic organizations. In fact, this archetypal form of American philanthropy—the permanently endowed foundation—began with the explicit mission of reforming the nation’s colleges and universities.30 Although Rockefeller and Carnegie had begun major personal giving in the late nineteenth century (especially for Baptist causes and public libraries, respectively), their ﬁrst endowed philanthropic institutions were all primarily focused on higher education: Rockefeller’s GEB (1902), the Carnegie Institution of Washington (1902), and Carnegie’s CFAT (1905).31 Rockefeller and Carnegie were not giving out of the kindness of their hearts, nor out of their desire to see their names inscribed in marble. Historians of philanthropy have recently begun casting aside long-standing assumptions of generic benevolence in early philanthropists, construed in the historiography ﬁrst as saintliness and then as witlessness.32 In the updated telling, as explained by Olivier Zunz, their project was “a capital-\n\n24 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nist venture in social betterment, not an act of kindness as understood in Christianity.”33 Their largesse took the form of what Judith Sealander calls “scientiﬁc giving.” They were interested not in relieving social ills but in resolving them: “Philanthropy should seek causes and cures. It should ﬁnd a remedy for a disease, rather than build a hospital to treat its victims.”34 In the realm of higher education, the diseases were disorganization, inefﬁciency, impracticality, and low standards. The “hospital” remedy would have been to build new colleges and universities, as many philanthropists (including Carnegie and Rockefeller) did. But that was a side project, not the main affair. In the pursuit of causes and cures, more sweeping initiatives were required.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller Sr. Rockefeller engaged with higher education ﬁrst. It was a surprising interest, since he had only the slightest personal experience with it: ten weeks at something called Folsom’s Commercial College in Cleveland in the summer of 1855. Rockefeller picked up the essentials of accounting, penmanship, and commercial law there, but this training did not translate easily into a job; it took six weeks of pounding the pavement before he found an unpaid apprenticeship as a bookkeeper.35 That apprenticeship famously turned into one of the largest commercial fortunes in history, driven especially by Rockefeller’s domination of the North American oil market. After the 1911 dismemberment of his great industrial trust, Standard Oil, Rockefeller’s personal net worth surpassed $900 million—about $24 billion in today’s dollars.36 Even his ﬁercest critic, Ida Tarbell, had to marvel at the ﬁrm, using engineering language to call it “as nearly a perfect machine, both in efﬁciency and in its monopolistic power, as ever had been devised”; at the same time, she employed the metaphor to argue that Rockefeller had cheated his way to success: “the whole system of discrimination has been nothing but violence.”37 From the time his wealth became an object of press attention (much of it negative) in the 1870s, Rockefeller was under siege by individuals and causes seeking handouts. The oil baron was notoriously tightﬁsted and for many years made only modest gifts, almost exclusively to Baptist causes.38 He was a devout, “born again” member of the Baptist Church—and the church was integral to his second rebirth, as a higher education reformer. The ﬁrst guide toward that transformation was a clergyman: the Reverend Augustus Strong. Rockefeller knew Strong from his pastorage of his hometown church in Cleveland, before the minister became the presi-\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 25\n\ndent of the Rochester Theological Seminary, which Ron Chernow calls “the citadel of Baptist orthodoxy.” Strong was also the chairman of the board of trustees of Vassar College, where Rockefeller sent his oldest daughter, Bessie. Most importantly, they were family; Bessie married Strong’s son in 1889.39 The many close connections between the two men yielded some ﬁnancial support for Rochester and Vassar but not for Strong’s great dream: the creation of a ﬂagship Baptist university in New York City. As designed, the institution would have stood at the apex of a uniﬁed system linking together hundreds of Baptist schools and colleges across the nation. I will return to this idea in chapter three, but the operative point for now is that Strong introduced the idea of systemic higher education reform to the oil baron—and then overplayed his hand. According to Chernow, the reverend “contended that he had a ‘divine mission’ to promote [the ﬂagship university]—and he badgered Rockefeller about it at every turn. . . . [He was] overbearing, as if trying to bully him into endorsing the project.”40 Rockefeller passed on the project and parted ways with his in-law, but his interest was piqued. It turned out that Strong was not the only person pushing the Baptist “super-university” idea, and New York was not the only candidate for its location.41 By 1888, a movement was underway in the Midwest to resurrect the defunct University of Chicago, a small Baptist institution that had perished due to ﬁnancial mismanagement, and build a new research university along the cutting-edge lines of Johns Hopkins.42 The cause’s champion was another Baptist minister: Frederick Gates (known to all as Fred), the executive secretary of the newly formed American Baptist Education Society and one of the most foremost academic engineers (I will describe him at length later in this chapter). Kenneth Rose gives Gates sole credit for persuading Rockefeller to pledge $600,000 for the Chicago effort. In written reports and personal conferences, Gates convinced the oil baron that New York was already well served by Baptist colleges and universities, in contrast to the “problem area” of the western states, of which Chicago was considered the capital.43 Gates also recruited William Rainey Harper, a prominent Yale professor and a fellow academic engineer, to be the ﬁrst president of the new university. This helped seal the deal with Rockefeller, who knew Harper from mutual interests at Vassar, where they “were often seen cycling around the campus together.”44 Harper helped Rockefeller develop an expansive view of the potential of higher education. In a 1929 retrospective interview about his philanthropy, the industrialist explained, “Following the principle of trying to abolish evils by destroying them at their source, we\n\n26 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nfelt that to aid colleges and universities, whose graduates would spread their culture far and wide, was the surest way to ﬁght ignorance and promote the growth of useful knowledge.”45 Even though this was revisionist history—the GEB worked hard in its early years to limit the number of college graduates—Rockefeller had certainly embraced the idea that higher education had a broad social purpose. Rockefeller split with Harper in 1897 over the president’s excessive spending at the university. In a letter that year, Gates explained that the industrialist’s newfound ardor for higher education made him all the more concerned with its wise ﬁnancial management. Rockefeller, he wrote, “feels that an institution of learning should be far more conservatively managed than, for instance, a bank, or even a savings bank or a trust company. These companies need only assure the depositor or investor that his funds will be duly cared for during the limited time in which they may be deposited. But a university invests the funds of those who are seeking to make an investment of money for the good of humanity, which shall last, if possible, as long as the world stands.”46 “As long as the world stands” was not a familiar concept in the nineteenth-century world of philanthropy, which revolved around immediate gifts of cash to alleviate suffering, as opposed to what Rockefeller called destroying evils “at their source.”47 Philanthropy in the twentieth century would increasingly move toward the latter model, most notably in the form of the permanently endowed foundation. Education gave the impetus for this dramatic switch. Much of the credit is due to the growing belief in the United States that education was the most effective vehicle for longlasting social change. As Michael Katz writes, this was in direct contrast to European nations (even those with conservative governments), which in the late nineteenth century were building the infrastructure of the social welfare state rather than pinning hopes on their ancient universities.48 Rockefeller embraced the idea of Chicago as an institutional source of reform, but he was not particularly interested in it as a university. He rarely visited it and declined to have either the institution or any campus buildings named after him. The same was true for the ﬁrst permanent philanthropic foundation he established—which was, in fact, the ﬁrst permanent foundation that anyone established. The General Education Board did not bear Rockefeller’s name, and he was not a trustee (although his namesake son was). Nevertheless, he endowed it lavishly and repeatedly. He had faith that the academic engineers he had placed at its helm would successfully prosecute its reformist goals—ﬁrst among them Gates, who dominated the foundation for two\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 27\n\ndecades after its 1902 origin. Rockefeller Jr. later described himself as the conduit between the reverend’s ideas and the industrialist’s money: “Gates was the brilliant dreamer and creator. I was the salesman—the go-between with father at the opportune moment.”49 Although historians of education largely associate the GEB with primary and secondary schooling, especially for Black children in the South, that was not its main purpose during Gates’ leadership.50 Higher education was, especially after Rockefeller donated $10 million to the foundation (ten times the amount of his founding gift) in 1905, for a program of reform targeted squarely at higher education.51 The GEB’s activities run throughout the rest of this book. The foundation and its counterparts maintained a relentless emphasis on accountability, efﬁciency, and thrift that came straight from Rockefeller’s core. Even more importantly, they drew on his incredibly successful business model in their belief that broad, integrated national systems would be as transformative in the higher education sector as they had been in industrial capitalism.\n\nAndrew Carnegie An interest in higher education was even less likely for Carnegie than for Rockefeller. His schooling had ended upon his immigration to the United States at age twelve. What further education he had took place in the Pennsylvania telegraph ofﬁces and railroad depots in which he ﬁrst proved himself as a businessman. By age sixty-ﬁve, he was a steel magnate, the richest private citizen in the world, and a proud autodidact.52 And yet, over the last twenty years of his life he gave away enormous amounts of money earmarked for higher education. As I have argued elsewhere, Carnegie underwent a profound transformation in his attitude toward colleges and universities, with four identiﬁable stages.53 Early in his philanthropic career, he dismissed higher education as effete and impractical. Around 1895, he started to embrace a bifurcated system that included high-level research and low-grade technical training but little in between. After the turn of the century, he turned to the middle ground, with a reformist agenda for baccalaureate colleges. Finally, in the last decade of his life he embraced the institutions he had once disdained, giving lavishly to a wide variety of colleges and universities. Carnegie’s agenda evolved, but he always had one, and he was willing to pay to see it enacted. First came antipathy. Standing on the steps of the newly opened Carne-\n\n28 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\ngie Library of Braddock, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Carnegie addressed the assembled steelworkers and inﬂuential Pittsburghers on an odd topic. While he extolled the value of the knowledge contained within the library, the ﬁrst of 1,679 that he would ﬁnance across the United States, he took time for a digression on the value of college education. His words were harsh and worth quoting at length: Men have sent their sons to colleges to waste their energies upon obtaining a knowledge of such languages as Greek and Latin, which are of no more practical use to them than Choctaw. . . . They have been “educated” as if they were destined for life upon some other planet than this. I do not wonder that a prejudice has arisen and still exists against such education. In my own experience I can say that I have known few young men intended for business who were not injured by a collegiate education. Had they gone into active work during the years spent at college they would have been better educated men in every true sense of that term. The ﬁre and energy have been stamped out of them, and how to so manage as to live a life of idleness and not a life of usefulness, has become the chief question with them.54\n\nCarnegie’s antipathy toward college-going extended beyond the classics and the traditional liberal curriculum to skepticism about the worth of anyone who did not learn “in the trenches” as he did. In 1885, addressing the graduates of a Pittsburgh “commercial college” that trained business clerks and did not award the bachelor’s degree, Carnegie advised, “Look out for the boy who has to plunge into work direct from the common school and who begins by sweeping out the ofﬁce. He is the probable dark horse that you had better watch.”55 Writing in the New York Tribune in 1891, he was blunter: “The almost total absence of the [college] graduate from high position in the business world seems to justify the conclusion that college education as it exists is almost fatal to success in that domain.”56 Carnegie’s criticism of college-going was hardly unique. Other inﬂuential leaders, especially those in the business realm, displayed a strong antipathy to holders of the bachelor’s degree. They perceived college as the domain of “weakly children” and the institutions themselves as esoteric and impractical.57 While undergraduate study was becoming a prerequisite for professions like medicine and law, college graduates were commonly judged unﬁt for careers in the complex bureaucratic organizations emerging at the forefront of the American economy.58 It is notable that Carnegie’s 1889 diatribe occurred in front of a library.\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 29\n\nHis library-building, for which he would soon become internationally famous, was an ideological project designed to facilitate the type of autodidacticism on which he prided himself. He never tired of telling the story of Colonel James Anderson, a Pittsburgh notable who opened his private library to the young Carnegie and other “working boys” in the 1850s.59 He described his reasoning for pouring his fortune into public libraries: “The fundamental advantage of a library is that it gives nothing. Youths must acquire knowledge themselves. There is no escape from this.”60 The chasm between this model and the didacticism he saw in college education was considerable. The colleges, however, were undeterred. After Carnegie announced his intent to become a philanthropist in his widely circulated 1889 essay “Wealth,” the solicitations from college leaders came quickly: for music halls, dormitories, teaching salaries, and unrestricted endowments. Almost all appear to have been refused, often with a friendly but ﬁrm explanation: “I am clearly of the opinion that I can do most good by selecting one ﬁeld and sticking to it, and that ﬁeld, as you know, is Free Libraries for the people.”61 Some tried particularly novel tactics. George W. Atherton, the president of Pennsylvania State College, maintained a constant campaign for support that yielded only modest contributions for student aid. In an 1895 letter asking for $200, he made a bold entreaty: “I cannot give up the hope that you will think favorably of making this institution Carnegie University.”62 Needless to say, the effort was unsuccessful. Atherton’s cross-state rival, the chancellor of Western University in Pittsburgh, tried a different form of ﬂattery in the cause of a campaign arguing that “it is manifest destiny that this great city must have a great school like Columbia, like Cornell. . . . We ought to begin now to plan big things.”63 A parttime lepidopterist, the chancellor named a newly discovered species of moth (Carnegia mirabilis) after the man with deep pockets.64 Andrew Dickson White offered a more valuable prize, one that Carnegie accepted and valued for years: his friendship. White was a historian, a politician, a diplomat, and the founding president of Cornell University, from 1866 to 1885. He had ﬁrst shown his prowess in the difﬁcult joining of business and higher education by convincing the telegraph magnate Ezra Cornell to endow the university that would bear his name.65 In the 1880s he turned his attention to Carnegie. White was perhaps Carnegie’s ﬁrst friend to be so intimately associated with higher education. By 1890, he had cajoled the industrialist into joining White on the university’s board of trustees. This did not yield the former president’s hopes for a donation, however. Writing to White the next year to deny his request for a music\n\n30 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nhall on campus, Carnegie gave his standard demurral: “I have taken Free Libraries as my line, and I believe in concentration.”66 Within a few years, however, that concentration was fracturing, as the business leader became more intimate with other higher education leaders. He remained a critic of college-going, but he began to realize that reform was a more promising strategy than disavowal. The following chapters detail many of the higher education reform efforts that Carnegie bankrolled, but two are worth mentioning brieﬂy at this point. The ﬁrst was the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This entity is a perfect example of the “scientiﬁc philanthropy” code: it came from an effort to enlist Carnegie to endow a new university but ended up as a mechanism to improve the efﬁciency and strength of existing ones. In the last few years of the nineteenth century, a handful of prominent Americans including White began agitating to establish a national university.67 Such an institution, located in Washington, DC, and patterned on European universities like the University of Berlin, would surely have a powerful effect on the nation’s higher education institutions through its normative inﬂuence at the top of a newly delineated national hierarchy. (I will return to this idea at length in chapter three.) Carnegie considered White’s request to endow the project but had mixed feelings about establishing a new institution when so many others existed. Writing to White in 1901, he explained, “You suggested National University at Washington, Washington’s desire, several have; but while this does, as you say, ensure immortality to the Founder, it has hitherto seemed to me not needed, and this puts immortality under foot. . . . Don’t care two cents about future ‘glory’. I must be satisﬁed that I am doing good wise beneﬁcial work in my day. Better come to Skibo and confer.”68 White did come to Skibo, Carnegie’s newly built castle in Scotland, that summer, along with Daniel Coit Gilman, the founding president of Johns Hopkins. This brain trust worked out a new scheme with efﬁciency at its heart. Instead of a new university, national or regional, Carnegie would instead endow an institution dedicated to advancing pure scientiﬁc research within the existing higher education framework. It would distribute grant money to professors and universities, organize research projects, publish ﬁndings, and sponsor conferences, thus reducing wasteful competition and overlap between institutions while spurring them to new heights of scholarship. As Carnegie explained to President Theodore Roosevelt that fall, “For some time I have been considering the propriety of fulﬁlling one of Washington’s strongest wishes, the founding of a University at Washington, but the conclusion reached was that, if with us today, he would\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 31\n\ndecide that under present conditions greater good would ensue from cooperation with, and strengthening of, existing universities throughout the country, than by adding to their number.”69 His friend and fellow industrialist-turned-reformer Abram Hewitt put it even better. Carnegie’s gift of $10 million establishing the Carnegie Institution of Washington (which had Gilman at the helm) would serve as “an educational ﬂy wheel, [and] will give a vigor and achieve results which otherwise would be impossible.”70 His imagery, derived from a mechanical device integral to the efﬁcient operation of a steam engine, was a good preview of the engineering ethos that was beginning to prevail over the rhetoric of higher education reform. Furthermore, engineering was a curricular centerpiece of both halves of Carnegie’s bifurcated vision, at research universities like Cornell as well as at the sub-baccalaureate schools like the Carnegie Institutes of Technology in Pittsburgh, which Carnegie had created the year before, and Cooper Union, which both Carnegie and Hewitt had generously endowed.71 In 1905, Carnegie turned fully toward reform. In that year, he gave another $10 million to endow another institution dedicated to higher education progress, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT). Much of the following chapters revolve around the activities of this foundation, so I will describe only its origins here. Carnegie’s gift was ostensibly earmarked for a very unlikely cause: a fund to provide pensions for retiring college professors. This was a misdirect. Reform was the unequivocal goal, and the pensions were merely carrots dangled in front of colleges that needed it. Historians typically (but incorrectly) attribute the CFAT gift to Carnegie’s humanitarian “impulse”72 and a special concern for poorly paid college professors dating back to his instatement on Cornell’s board of trustees.73 This is unlikely. Up to 1905, Carnegie never expressed any affection for college faculty.74 His sentiment ran toward mockery, as he expressed in a 1900 speech in England: “I have walked over the moors with more than one learned professor who did not know the lark from the thrush . . . perhaps in American slang I may be allowed to say, he didn’t know beans.”75 These were not the words of a man eager to reward the efforts of college instructors. But while Carnegie was not interested in professors, he was ﬁnally interested in colleges. This was largely in response to an onslaught of aid requests. By 1905, Carnegie’s secretary estimated that “three or four hundred such applications in regard to colleges” were on ﬁle.76 Many cash-strapped colleges organized extensive letter-writing campaigns in the hopes of victory through overwhelming force. Coe College in Iowa, for\n\n32 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nexample, sent over twenty letters in a single week, representing students, alumni, local business leaders, presidents of neighboring colleges, US senators, the postmaster of Cedar Rapids, and the president of the National Biscuit Company. By 1904, Carnegie wrote to White to complain about all the “begging,” leading to a reproach from the former administrator, who himself had spent many years asking for such gifts.77 These small colleges requested endowments, libraries, classroom buildings, and even entire academic departments, but one category was conspicuously absent from the wish lists: professorial pensions. Instead, the idea for a nationwide pension fund came directly from Carnegie, and it was designed as an instrument of reform. Along with Henry Pritchett, Carnegie imposed two critical features on the fund. The ﬁrst was that an individual professor could not apply for a pension; everything had to be regulated by the professor’s college or university. The second feature was that in order to participate in the pension program, institutions had to comply with strict regulations set by the CFAT. Each of the regulations had a reformist goal, including remaking the academic ranks, exorcising religion from colleges and universities, setting minimum institutional standards, and broadly promoting accountability and efﬁcient management. The pensions were merely a means to these ends. If Carnegie had any doubt about the potential of his scheme, it must have been assuaged by the rousing congratulations that poured in immediately after he announced the gift. Jacob Schurman, president of Cornell, described the fund as “the wisest thing ever conceived in the interest of higher education in America.”78 Harper of Chicago deemed it “one of the most brilliant things that has been conceived in the history of American education” and later called the ﬁrst meeting of the CFAT trustees “an occasion which seems to me to be one of the most signiﬁcant in the history of modern education.”79 (Harper had, in fact, proposed an organization called the Carnegie College Institution the previous year.80 It was a version of an idea that he had in 1902 to create a blue-ribbon board of “men of national reputation” who would raise and spend money to promote “practical economies on the educational side as well as on the ﬁnancial” for American colleges.81) Carnegie’s reformist crusade in higher education faded in the last decade of his life.82 As he aged, he softened, and by the 1910s he was giving unrestricted funds to colleges and universities. This denouement, however, should not distract us from the zealous focus that informed his earlier philanthropy. We cannot understand the ﬁrst movement for systemic reform in higher education without acknowledging its origins in monopo-\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 33\n\nlistic, vertically integrated capitalism. We also cannot tell this story as one of internal changes driven by campus administrators, which is the theme of classic analyses of elite universities like Lawrence Veysey’s The Emergence of the American University.83 For the vast majority of the higher education sector, external, top-down reform backed by outsiders like Rockefeller and Carnegie was the dominant force of the day. The rest of this chapter provides sketches of six exemplary academic engineers who served as arbiters of that benefaction. They were not by any means the only members of this group. I have already mentioned some individuals who epitomized every signiﬁer I mentioned earlier. Nicholas Murray Butler studied in Germany, sat on the CFAT board, and fully embraced the college-as-a-problem mantra. So did David Starr Jordan of Stanford. So did Arthur Twining Hadley of Yale. Harper sat on both the CFAT and the GEB boards and was perhaps the leading reform theorist of the cohort. While he did not do any graduate study in Germany, that was because he was even more of an educational outsider than his peers; he had been a child genius who entered college at age ten and earned a Yale doctorate at nineteen. But the most interesting academic engineers are the ones who never ran elite institutions. Since they did not already think of themselves as members of a new American aristocracy, their commitment to top-down reform is even more remarkable. Their outsider status was more pronounced, and so was the force of their vision.\n\nFrederick T. Gates The Reverend “Fred” Gates is best described as Rockefeller’s consigliere on philanthropic matters, and he was a close business advisor as well. The industrialist trusted Baptist ministers. Although Gates’s pastoral days ended before the two met, he retained the spirit of the evangelical revivalism of upstate New York’s “burned-over district,” where both men had been born before moving to the Midwest as children. He was a striking character. Sealander opens her analysis of philanthropy’s turn to “scientiﬁc giving” with Gates in full form: “arms waving, long white hair ﬂowing wildly . . . characteristically banging a table with the ﬂat of his hand” in front of a group of Rockefeller conﬁdants.84 Chernow describes his “prosecutorial zeal and ministerial fervor.”85 John Boyer calls him “a tough-minded rationalist with little patience for soft-hearted social causes.”86 Fosdick, who worked with him as a young man, calls him “a dominating and sagacious man . . . fundamentally a ﬁgure of ardor and\n\n34 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nzeal, with little humor—either about himself or anything else—and with very few doubts.”87 Although he later became closely identiﬁed with other Rockefeller causes, including medicine, Gates’s ﬁrst and most ardent passion was higher education reform. Most notably, he relentlessly sought to systemize and strengthen American colleges and universities, reserving special scorn for weak institutions in isolated locations. His contemporary Sigmund Freud would have had some psychoanalytical fun with this obsession, given Gates’s personal background in higher education. His ﬁrst alma mater was something called Highland University in rural Kansas, which can be described only as an extraordinarily modest institution. In his memoirs, Gates admits that it was just a single building, “two stories, of ﬁfty by eighty feet. . . . We had no great and splendid groups of buildings, no long line of distinguished alumni, presidents, professors, and trustees. We had none of the pride of age or wealth.”88 He spent eight years at the institution. At age twenty-two he entered the University of Rochester, which held only slightly more claim to the moniker of “university”; it had less than two hundred students and offered no real graduate training. Gates remembered it as “then a small college under Baptist auspices.”89 Fosdick is blunter, calling it “a Baptist institution whose search for candidates was not handicapped by considerations of academic standards.”90 Gates was blasé about his experience, writing, “My college course simply conﬁrmed me in habits of study, reading, and reﬂection. I can truthfully say little else for it.” He echoed Carnegie’s brand of book-based autodidactism, based on his experience of teaching himself classics, which “conﬁrmed in me the belief that with modern textbooks a man with reasonable independence and self-reliance need not be dependent on a college classroom.”91 He did not earn a bachelor’s degree and instead transferred his studies to the afﬁliated Rochester Theological Seminary. Gates next spent eight years as a minister in Minneapolis and then in 1888 was chosen as the ﬁrst executive secretary of the newly founded American Baptist Education Society, largely on his reputation as a tireless fundraiser for Minnesota schools and churches. The organization had oversight of hundreds of loosely connected institutions serving all ages, but Gates immediately ﬁxed his reformist eyes on the top of the jumbled pyramid. Within months he had thrust himself forcefully into the cause of establishing a ﬂagship Baptist institution, issuing a report called “The Need for a Baptist University in Chicago, as Illustrated by a Study of Baptist College Education in the West.”\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 35\n\nThe document is perhaps the ur-text of academic engineering. Gates argued for far more than the endowment of a new institution. Brimming with hastily gathered statistics, charts, and maps, the report laid out a scathing criticism of existing Baptist higher education, which existed in “a state of destitution” and desperately needed top-down reformation. The primary function of a new university would be a normative one, Gates explained: “Before its walls were reared, before its foundations could be laid, the mere assurance of such an enterprise made certain by means provided would lift up the heads of our colleges and clothe them with renewed vigor and larger inﬂuence.”92 His 1888 vision of a dynamic hierarchical system set the tone for much of the academic engineering project. So did his goal of using that ethos to yield philanthropic dollars, as he revealed in a letter to a colleague that same year: “A scheme so vast, so continental, so orderly, so comprehensive, so detailed, will in my view capture a mind so constituted as Mr. Rockefeller’s is.”93 Rockefeller was soon on board for the project of forming what Chernow calls “an educational trust of Western colleges.”94 More importantly, his pocketbook was open to the cause of academic engineering, and the ﬁngers in that pocketbook were Gates’s. The utmost expressions of that relationship took place in the workings of the General Education Board, which I will continue to analyze throughout this book. For its ﬁrst decade, Gates ruled it with an iron ﬁst and used it to advance his vision of higher education reform to unprecedented heights. In his memoirs, he took care to gloat about the GEB’s congressional charter, one of the few ever given to a philanthropic organization, which allowed the board “authority to hold limitless capital and to do anything whatever which could be construed to be directly or even remotely educational.”95 He also admitted to ghostwriting Rockefeller’s gift letter for his 1905 pledge, which earmarked $10 million for efforts to “promote a comprehensive system of higher education in the United States.”96 Gates always insisted that the GEB’s grants be made with an eye to fostering a balanced national system of colleges and universities. He was especially obsessed with the geography of this hoped-for system. His ofﬁcial GEB obituary noted, “The great map of the United States which hung on the walls of the General Education Board Room and to which he frequently turned to make graphic his thought and expression symbolized the large way in which his mind worked. Thus he would mark the great fortresses and the outposts of higher education in this country.”97 Gates aimed to spread institutions so that they would not compete with one another, a task that would require eliminating hundreds of existing schools. He wrote\n\n36 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nan internal memo for Rockefeller Jr. that explained his restrictionist theory of action: I want to see a hundred colleges in this country so planted as to cover the whole land and leave no part destitute, each of them planted in a fruitful soil, each so planted that it shall not be overshadowed by others, each conducted under such auspices as will take care of it, see that it is watered, particularly in its earlier years, see that it is properly fertilized, see that the forces of destruction which always fasten themselves on institutions shall be pruned away.98\n\nThis hundred-college vision, of course, did not come to be. Still, in his memoirs Gates ﬂatly credited the GEB with the successful wholesale reform of American colleges and universities. In 1905, he recalled, “I had a reasonably clear bird’s-eye view of the whole ﬁeld and, while there was much to encourage, there was much also to regret. The picture was one of chaos.” In 1926, after two decades of the academic engineering project, he could say of the United States, “Clearly we have the most efﬁcient system of higher education in the world.”99\n\nHenry S. Pritchett Of all the academic engineers, Henry Pritchett experienced perhaps the most dramatic fall from fame to obscurity. We have only three signiﬁcant explorations of the life and work of the man who served for twenty-ﬁve years as the CFAT’s ﬁrst president: a 1943 biography by a close friend and two histories of the CFAT, in 1953 and 1983.100 These were not impromptu scholarly inquiries; all three were commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation. What other latter-day mentions of Pritchett we have almost always discuss him primarily in the context of the famous Flexner Report on medical education, which he commissioned.101 And the close friend who wrote his biography, it is worth mentioning, was Abraham Flexner. And yet, Pritchett was well known and highly inﬂuential in his day, especially in the key years from 1905 to 1915. As the foundation’s president, Pritchett had a bully pulpit. He authored book-length annual reports, gave countless speeches, and published constantly in news magazines. Lagemann, in her 1983 CFAT history, writes, “His rhetoric, embroidered with facts and statistics, was often stirring and earnestly moral. His opinions derived from principle and were tenaciously argued and adhered to.”102 Flexner is even more generous but still hints at his dogmatic streak: “He\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 37\n\nhad a consciousness of what was right which never deserted him. He had ‘the prepared mind,’ upon the importance of which Pasteur had insisted, but how it was prepared is not known.”103 On the topic of mental preparation, Pritchett’s higher education was decidedly haphazard. Whether or not he held a bachelor’s degree is in dispute: Flexner claims he did, Lagemann says he didn’t, and his own unpublished memoir doesn’t mention one.104 His undergraduate training took place in rural Missouri at an institution variously known as Pritchett School Institute or Pritchett College, operated by his father. He left at age eighteen for training in astronomy at the Naval Observatory in Washington and returned to Missouri four years later to take a job as the director of an observatory in his hometown. He parlayed this opportunity into an observatory job at Washington University in St. Louis and eventually a professorship there. Finally, at age thirty-seven, he rounded off his education with a PhD earned at the University of Munich. According to Flexner, he completed the degree in just eight months, during which time he also toured Europe extensively with his teenage sons.105 At forty-three, Pritchett found himself the president of a low-status urban technical college commonly called Boston Tech. Its full name was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it was years from being MIT in terms of both nomenclature and prestige.106 It was in this capacity that Pritchett ﬁrst got to know Carnegie, who had a strong interest in technical higher education. The industrialist consulted with him often on matters related to the Carnegie Institution of Washington (which counted astronomy as one of its chief foci) and in fact lobbied for him to become the institution’s president upon Daniel Coit Gilman’s retirement in 1904. In that year, Carnegie wrote to a trustee that “I was very favorably impressed with my friend Pritchett. . . . He seems one of the men who can do things.”107 Pritchett actively pursued the opportunity, but the trustees ultimately passed him over in favor of someone whom another trustee predicted “would meet with the general approval of the Scientiﬁc men of the Country to a much greater extent than would that of Dr. Pritchett.”108 Still, Carnegie did not give up on ﬁnding a leadership role for his friend. The two men saw eye to eye on the vision of a bifurcated system of higher education. When Pritchett took the reins at MIT, it was located in cramped quarters in the city of Boston and served commuter students who came to study applied technical ﬁelds. This was a situation most unbeﬁtting the research university the young president aspired to lead. Working with the Boston philanthropist Henry Lee Higginson, in 1904 Pritchett convinced Carnegie to contribute $400,000 to establish a new\n\n38 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\ntechnical school in Boston. Pritchett’s brilliant apparatus was to convince the industrialist to match a century-old bequest left to the city of Boston by Benjamin Franklin. The association with the most famous American autodidact proved too great to resist, and Carnegie put up the cash to establish the Franklin Union in the city’s working-class South End. Thus divested from the burden of training Boston’s industrial workers, Pritchett was free to pursue his plan of relocating the institute to Cambridge and the academic halo of Harvard.109 The next collaboration came soon after, with the establishment of the CFAT. In 1904, Pritchett was seeking contributions to MIT’s modest pension fund.110 Other more robust, universities had better-endowed pension plans, including Columbia, Yale, Harvard, and Cornell; German universities also had a long history of professorial pensions.111 Carnegie did not contribute to the MIT fund but proposed a much farther-reaching plan to extend pensions to dozens of institutions. In February of 1905, Pritchett jumped on board with Carnegie’s proposal.112 He agreed to run the numbers on what such a scheme would entail, working with Frank Vanderlip, a bank president and Carnegie conﬁdant, as actuarial advisor. Two months later, the research was done but lightly considered; Carnegie donated his usual $10,000,000 to the still-unnamed foundation, with the clear expectation that professorial pensions would be used as coercive carrots spurring reform in colleges and universities. Pritchett would spend the rest of his professional life using the CFAT to advance the academic engineering agenda. He openly touted this power, boasting in a 1906 essay in The Outlook that the foundation would become “a centralizing and standardizing inﬂuence” that would fundamentally reshape the American higher education sector, especially by “clearing our ideas of educational administration and bringing in right standards.”113 Pritchett’s primary goal in wielding that “standardizing inﬂuence” was to restrict the ambitions of colleges and students. Like Gates, he held a special perverse antipathy toward humble colleges like the one he had attended himself. In 1908, Pritchett wrote, “We have founded many more colleges under this system than we can possibly maintain, colleges which are colleges in name only and which will for many years continue to demoralize our standards of education and to place before our people false ideas of what education is. Ultimately, perhaps, the weaker and more objectionable of these colleges will disappear.”114 His highly visible post also earned him the most enmity of any academic engineer, as I will show in chapters 6 and 7.\n\nt h e a c a d e m i c e n g i n e e r s : 39\n\nGenerally, though, Pritchett operated with impunity, and he knew it. Writing late in life to his successor, he gloated, “One of the ﬁne things about the presidency of the Carnegie Foundation is the great freedom of speech the president has. He has no constituency like a great body of alumni on his back. The trustees have got pretty well inured to the notion that the president can take up any subject in education he pleases. . . . Whether it is wise for a man to have as great freedom to air his opinions as all this comes to is another matter.”115\n\nFrank Vanderlip Pritchett’s partner in the actuarial framing of CFAT certainly ﬁt the description of an outsider who had made it big. Frank Vanderlip, vice president and soon-to-be president of the enormous National City Bank in New York, had been born in rural Illinois. He was immensely proud of his rustic roots, even titling his 1935 memoir From Farm Boy to Financier. He is best remembered as a member of the secretive Jekyll Island group that created the Federal Reserve system in 1911, but he took plenty of time along the way for the cause of academic engineering. Like Pritchett, whom he called “my closest friend,” Vanderlip had a spotty higher education.116 It took place at the University of Illinois, his second choice of institution after an initial dream of studying electrical engineering at Cornell. He made it through just one year of college before taking a correspondence course in shorthand and landing a job at a local newspaper. This turned into years as a business reporter for the Chicago Tribune, a position in the Treasury Department (where he ﬁrst met Pritchett, who was also in Washington at the time), and eventually bank leadership in Manhattan. Vanderlip was an autodidact who could veer into plain antiintellectualism. Carnegie revered libraries as hubs of self-directed learning, but his banker friend described their limits in a 1905 speech: “Book covers contain much knowledge, but may also shut out from a too close student much wisdom, —much of that sort of wisdom which is gained by experience in the world.” 117 And he was blunt about social realities, the kind of bank president who could tell a gathering of bank clerks, “Certainly you cannot all be bank presidents. We need many privates, and comparatively few generals. Not a few of you, ﬁlled with ambition though you may be to-day, will go on year after year in faithful regularity . . . never advancing to the highest positions.”118 He was equally blunt when it came to a favorite topic: education reform.\n\n40 : c h a p t e r o n e\n\nIn May 1905, he claimed that the cause of many highe"
