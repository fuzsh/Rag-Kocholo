        "text": "Earn a Minor in Political Science\n\nImpact communities locally and nationwide through political leadership\n\nThe Minor in Political Science prepares students to pursue a career in political or civil services. While many Newman University bachelor programs can be complimented by a political science minor, programs such as History, Business, and Communication degrees paired with a Political Science Minor greatly increase the marketability of their degree.\n\nEmploying traditional lecture, Socratic inquiry, and other methods, the faculty members at our prestigious private university work closely with students to foster a dynamic classroom setting in which students can develop their ideas, research and writing skills.\n\nAbout Our Faculty\n\nPolitical Science Department\n\nOur faculty and staff have the knowledge and experience to help you prepare for a career in political science. If you need clarification on a class assignment or advice on how to approach your future, you can feel confident that our faculty is available and ready to help.\n\nCareers\n\nA minor in political science will give you the opportunity to work in a variety of fields and specialties. Below are a few examples of potential careers and their median salaries based working professionals with years of experience in their fields, usually with master's degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015):\n\nCampaign Manager ($104,140 a year)\n\nProfessor of Political Science (salaries vary)\n\nLegislative Aide ($48,810 a year)\n\nPolitical Scientists ($99,730 a year)\n\nInternships\n\nStudents minoring in political science have the opportunity to gain real-world experience by interning in the Wichita community. This allows you to gain experience working for local political campaigns and congressional offices.\n\nGet Involved on Campus\n\nOne of the best ways to find success during your college career is to get involved in campus clubs and organizations. Within our political science program, our students can join the Newman University College Republicans, History Club, or Phi Alpha Theta. These organizations allow for personal growth, networking, and future career success.\n\nSuccessful Program Outcomes\n\nSuccess Story — Wesley Williams Class of 2016\n\nWesley Williams received the opportunity to be one of Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins' (R-KS 02) three interns for the summer during his senior year. Wesley said he will assist the rest of the congressional staff by giving tours, making copies, directing constituent concerns to the proper place, and helping with the day-to-day operations. Wesley is considering going into politics himself. He plans to attend law school after graduating from Newman. Williams said that Newman has done a great job preparing him for his current position.\n\n\"I think possibly the most important thing is Newman’s mission. They have trained me to ‘transform society’ and while I may not be doing that directly (yet), I am well on the path to being that mover-and-shaker that we are taught to be.\"\n\nWesley Williams, Class of 2015\n\n\"The communication and teamwork, especially with my advisors, and having that small classroom size really helped me because it was a one-on-one. They knew my name and I wasn’t just a number.\"\n\nEmily Levian, CLASS OF 2016"
