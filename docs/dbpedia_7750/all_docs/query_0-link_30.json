Characters in the author and institution listing will not be counted. There is a strict limit of one graph, figure or table to each submitted abstract. No exceptions will be made.\n\nSubmission Deadline\n\nAll abstracts must be submitted online by Thursday, February 1, 2024. No exceptions will be made.\n\nAbstract Review\n\nAll abstracts submitted will be reviewed and graded, in blinded fashion, by the Annual Meeting Scientific Program Committee. Two-year follow-up is required for papers submitted to the Annual Meeting. Based upon abstract grading, those selected will be assigned to a four-minute oral presentation or three-minute E-Point presentation. Acceptance notification will be sent in May 2024.\n\nDisclosure and Licensing Requirement\n\nThe Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) must ensure balance, independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in all educational activities. Therefore, as a person who is in position to influence or control the content of a CME activity, ALL abstract authors must disclose all financial relationships held in the past 24 months with ineligible companies.* If the financial relationship has occurred in the past 24 months, but has since ended, we still require you to disclose the relationship. Visit this link to disclose: https://owpm1.com/abstracts/SRSAM/disclosure\n\nThe username is the email associated with your abstract and the password your first name.\n\n*An ineligible company is an entity whose primary business is producing, marketing, selling, re-selling, or distributing health care goods or services consumed by or on patients. For specific examples of ineligible companies visit accme.org/standards.\n\nPrevious Publication or Presentation\n\nAbstracts which have been published in journals, meeting proceedings, or other publication, as well as those presented at meetings prior to the SRS meeting to which authors wish to submit are NOT eligible for submission. Only abstracts that have NOT been previously published or presented are eligible for submission.\n\nProduct-Specific Language\n\nThe term “hardware” should not be used in written abstract submissions, oral presentations and E-Point presentations. The terms “instrumentation,” “implants,” “constructs,” or “montage” should be used instead.\n\nSRS strongly prefers that surgical approaches or specific instrumentation such as “Isola, TSRH, CD, XLIF, DLIF, AxiaLIF, Solera, Vertex, Expedium, Mountaineer, Shilla, VEPTR etc.,” are not used in presentations. These terms should be replaced by a generic description of the instrumentation or technique unless the use of the term directly impacts learners’ understanding of the presentation or data. Instrumentation may also be referred to when the device name is a landmark system that is no longer sold (i.e. Harrington, Cotrel-Dubousset, Luque). Company names and logos must never be used in a presentation.\n\nIt is recognized that studies evaluating a device or devices or comparing different devices or techniques may require the use of product or technique names. If a device trade name or industry developed technique using a trademarked name are used in an abstract or presentation, it will be specifically reviewed by the CME Committee for evaluation of any potential conflict of interest. When there is a known potential conflict of interest, an expanded verbal disclosure will be necessary at the time of presentation. Furthermore, if a product name is mentioned, the audience should be informed of why it is necessary to give the name.\n\nAttendance\n\nBy submitting an abstract to the Annual Meeting, abstract authors are agreeing that at least one (1) author will attend the meeting for which the abstract is accepted and will be available to present on the date and at the time assigned by the organizing committees. Authors will be notified of presentation times at the time of or shortly after notification of acceptance and are expected to make appropriate travel arrangements to ensure that at least one of the abstract’s authors will be in attendance. In addition, presenting authors are expected to register to attend the meetings for which they are accepted by the deadline set forth in their acceptance notification. Abstracts for which an author is not pre-registered by the dates set forth with automatically be withdrawn from the program.\n\nAcceptance\n\nAll selected authors will be required to respond to a formal invitation, by June 4, 2024, to confirm participation in the program.\n\nOral Presentation Cancellation & No-Show Policy\n\nAuthors unable to present their paper in person should inform SRS as soon as possible with a co-author that can attend to present the paper. If no one is able to attend in person, please inform SRS by January, so an alternate paper can be substituted. Please note that in the case of a \"no-show\" podium presentation, the presenting author associated with the \"no-show\" paper will be prohibited from presenting any papers at the next two Annual Meetings.\n\nE-Point Presentation Cancellation Policy\n\nAt least one author or co-author on all E-Point presentations is expected to register to attend the meeting, for which they are accepted, by the deadline set forth in their acceptance notification. If this author cancels their registration prior to the meeting, the E-Point presentation may be withdrawn from the program.\n\nAdvance Presentation Submission Requirement\n\nAll presentations must clear a CME review conducted by the SRS CME Committee. Presenters may be required to submit slides for review before the meeting and may be asked to make small or significant changes if a bias issue is found. Failure to address pertinent CME review issues will result in pulling the presentation from the program and in a one-year ban for abstract presentations and a three-year ban for invited speakers and faculty presentations.\n\nRegistration\n\nFaculty and Presenting Authors: Please refer to your invitation.\n\nFaculty and presenting authors are required to register for the meeting and pay the required registration fees. If the original presenting author is unable to present their abstract live in Barcelona, another co-author on the paper may present in their place. Please contact education@srs.org by June 27, 2024 with any author changes.\n\nFor more information on registration, please visit: Registration.\n\nPodium Presentation Cancellation & No-Show Policy\n\nAuthors unable to present their paper in-person should inform SRS as soon as possible with a co-author that can attend to present the paper. If no one can attend in-person, please inform SRS by June 27, 2024, so an alternate paper can be substituted.\n\nPlease note: In the case of a \"no-show\" podium presentation, the presenting author associated with the \"no-show\" paper will be prohibited from presenting any papers at the next two Annual Meetings.\n\nE-Point Presentation Cancellation Policy\n\nAt least one author or co-author on all E-Point presentations is expected to register to attend the meeting by June 27, 2024.\n\nIf this author cancels their registration prior to the meeting, the E-Point presentation may be withdrawn from the program.\n\nManuscripts\n\nManuscripts are required for abstracts selected for Podium presentations. Manuscripts must be uploaded in the Speaker Management System by presenting authors no later than August 14, 2024. Please do not upload your manuscript in the Speaker Ready Room.\n\nFor more information, please visit: Manuscript Guidelines\n\nCME\n\nThe 59th Annual Meeting is CME accredited, and it is therefore essential that the presentations are free from commercial influence. References to commercial products must use their generic name or be balanced by referring to other similar products. Please see the guidelines below for CME information.\n\nNon-Exclusive License and Attestation\n\nAll faculty, podium, and E-Point presenting authors must complete a Non-Exclusive License and Attestation Form in the Speaker Management System. All presenters will be prompted to complete this form upon logging in to accept their presentation(s) by June 4, 2024.\n\nDisclosures\n\nAll faculty, podium, and E-Point presentations must disclose the author’s financial relationships with ineligible companies, from the past 24 months, on the second slide of the presentation.\n\nPlease note: An ineligible company is one whose primary business is producing, marketing, selling, re-selling, or distributing healthcare products used by or on patients.\n\nSample Disclosure Slide\n\nProduct Name Use Policy\n\nSRS strongly prefers that pharmaceuticals and proprietary software/databases as well as surgical approaches or specific instrumentation such as “Surgimap, MIMICS, EOS Imaging, ROTEM, XLIF, DLIF, AxiaLIF, Solera, Vertex, Expedium, Mountaineer, VEPTR, Shilla, etc.,” are not used in presentations. These terms should be replaced by a generic term or description of the drug, software/database and/or instrumentation or technique unless the use of the term directly impacts learners’ understanding of the presentation or data. Instrumentation may also be referred to when the device name is a landmark system that is no longer sold (i.e. Harrington, Cotrel-Dubousset, Luque). It is recognized that studies evaluating a device or devices or comparing different devices or techniques may require the use of product or technique names. If a device trade name or industry developed technique using a trademarked name are used in an abstract or presentation, it will be specifically reviewed by the CME Committee for evaluation of any relevant financial relationships. When there is a known relevant financial relationship, expanded verbal disclosure will be necessary at the time of presentation. Furthermore, if a product name is mentioned, the audience should be informed of why it is necessary to give the name.\n\nProduct-Specific Language Glossary\n\nAll presentations must be uploaded through the Speaker Ready Room.
