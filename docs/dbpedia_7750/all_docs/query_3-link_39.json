        "text": "LifeLaunchr’s database contains profiles of (nearly) every four-year public and private non-profit university in the United States. We don’t include information on for-profit institutions, two-year institutions, or solely graduate institutions yet. We’ll be expanding our search to add those soon. To use the college match, enter information about yourself. Then make selections in the various selection boxes.\n\nThe list automatically updates itself when you make changes. Since different criteria are important to different users, we allow you to say which criteria matter and which don’t. You can enter over 35 different criteria including cost, earnings, location, academic selectivity, and culture. When you find institutions you might be interested in, click the buttons on the left of the name to expand their entries. You’ll be able to see which colleges are “far reach,” reach,” “target,” or “likely” schools for you. You’ll also be able to see the likely cost for students in your income bracket and the median earnings after college for students who attend the university. If the median earnings are higher than the national average, you’ll see a plus sign next to the number. Otherwise, you’ll see a minus sign.\n\nLifeLaunchr’s college profiles provide detailed information on admissions statistics, academics, culture, diversity, sports, and more. To see a college’s profile, click on the “Profile” link.\n\nOur profiles also contain answers to over 40 questions about each college – ranging from questions about which majors the college is best known for to questions about sports teams and cultural diversity – generated by Open AI’s Chat GPT and verified by our coaches. This provides an extraordinary trove of information about each college, all arranged in the same way for each college. You have to be a LifeLaunchr member to access all the answers. Memberships start at just $249/year."
