        "text": "Born January 14, 1936, Philadelphia, PA. Attended Central High School, 1949-1953, Swarthmore College, 1953 - 1957, BA, major Mathematics, and Rockefeller University, 1957 - 1962, PhD. Was a post-doctoral trainee in David Nachmansohn's group at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1962 - 1965. Started research on acetylcholinesterase and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and continued working on the receptor for 40 years. More recently worked on the structure and function of potassium channels, mainly the BK calcium and voltage-activated potassium channel. Concurrently, developed a mathematical model of arterial smooth muscle function that successfully simulated the myogenic response and the responses to alpha and beta adrenergic agonists, nitric oxide, and endothelial relaxing factor. For about 20 years until the present, taught one quarter of the Molecular Biophysics course and a semester course in Membrane Receptors and Transport Proteins. From 1985 to 1989, director of the Summer Course in Neurobiology at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA. Married to Cynthia Rollings, Children: Oliver, Abigail, Daniel, Samuel, Joe and Emma.\n\nAcademic Positions\n\n1962-1963: Research Assistant, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University\n\n1963-1964: Research Associate, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University\n\n1965-1969: Assistant Professor of Neurology, P & S, Columbia University\n\n1969-1974: Associate Professor of Physiology in Neurology, P & S, Columbia University\n\n1974-1978: Associate Professor of Neurochemistry, P & S, Columbia University\n\n1978-present: Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Neurology\n\n1989-present: Higgins Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and Neurology, and Director of the Center for Molecular Recognition, P & S, Columbia University\n\n1991- present: Professor of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, P & S, Columbia University.\n\nUnderstanding the function of molecular receptors has been my guiding interest and the central mission of the Center. Receptors function in three steps: signal recognition, transduction, and transmission. This is exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on which I worked for forty years. These receptors bind acetylcholine, transduce this binding into the opening of a pore, and conduct cations causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane. We identified the overall receptor structure and, within this, the specific sites and substructures at the front-line of these functional steps. More recently, this approach was applied to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-ion-activated channel, widely expressed and responsible for membrane hyperpolarization.\n\nAlso recently, I began to consider cellular functions that depend on circuits of signaling components. Cellular function depends on the functions of individual molecular components and on their coordination via direct or indirect interactions. Cellular function also depends on cellular structure and on the distribution of the functional molecular components in these structures. Crucial to the specificity and effectiveness of the interactions among functional components are microdomains, which both channel and amplify the signals between components. My approach to understanding such systems is to represent all steps as kinetic equations, consistent with thermodynamics, and to solve the resulting equations in time and space. To the extent that experimental data exist, the equations are fit to these data. Such a model is a mathematical summary of the known properties of the components and of the target cellular function. Notwithstanding, such a model is a hypothetical outline of how the cell might function, always wanting experimental tests and refinement.\n\nRahman MM, Teng J, Worrell BT, Noviello CM, Lee M, Karlin A, Stowell MHB, Hibbs RE.
