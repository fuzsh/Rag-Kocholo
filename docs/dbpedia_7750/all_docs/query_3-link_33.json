        "text": "What Is Reading Prosody?\n\nDespite its presumed status as the hallmark of fluent reading, we currently know little about the nature of reading prosody per se. To read prosodically, children must be able to do more than decode the text and translate punctuation into speech. They must also incorporate the ordinary rise and fall of pitch in ordinary conversation. This would include a series of speech features that jointly would be perceived by the listener as an expressive rendering of a text (Allington, 1983; Dowhower, 1987; Schreiber, 1980, 1987, 1991).\n\nTo study reading prosody, one must transform speech sound waves of oral reading into a visual representation called a spectrogram where the waves can be analyzed more or less directly. Among the features potentially important to reading prosody are (a) perceived changes in pitch (indicated spectrographically as fundamental frequency or F0; Lieberman, 1996), (b) stress or loudness (indicated spectrographically as signal amplitude), and (c) duration and pausing (usually measured in milliseconds). Pauses both within sentences (intrasentential) and between sentences (intersentential) can be identified objectively by demarking and measuring points of silence on the spectrograph not accounted for phonetically. One can measure directly the drop in F0 at the ends of sentences (sentence-final F0 declination) between the final pitch peak in the sentence and the lowest pitch at the end of the sentence (sentence-final F0). Moreover, changes in F0 can be measured at any point in the sentence. Additionally, prosodic reading may include appropriately chunking groups of words into phrases or meaningful units in accordance with the syntactic structure of the text. Taken together, these speech features are classified as suprasegmental because they extend over more than one speech sound and contribute to meaning.\n\nChafe (1988) suggested that, to read a sentence with intonation, one must assign syntactic roles to the words in the sentence. The assignment of syntactic roles is a key component of microprocessing, or the mental parsing of a text into hierarchically ordered propositions (Kintsch, 1998). Schreiber (1987) also suggested that the explicit presence of prosodic cues might be one crucial difference between speech and reading, and one of the reasons that speech is easier to understand. However, Schreiber reported that the evidence supporting a link between prosody and microprocessing is weak, with some studies finding links between the use of prosodic features and syntactic comprehension and others failing to find such an effect. Recently, Koriat, Greenberg, and Kreiner (2002) found that Hebrew-speaking adults' use of prosodic features reflected their processing of syntactic information, but not semantic information. They found that disruptions to syntax affected the quality of their participants' reading, but that participants were able to give a good prosodic rendering of well-structured, but nonsensical, sentences.\n\nOne point to consider regarding reading prosody is that the understanding of prosodic features in spoken language itself may be under development to some extent at the age when most children are learning to read prosodically. Children as old as 8 years of age process prosodic stress patterns in comprehension poorly. For example, they may not understand the communicative difference between sentences such as Beth is already at the party and Beth is already at the party. Even 9- and 10-year-olds are not quite at adult levels in understanding the function of some contextual prosodic features (Cruttenden, 1984, 1985; but see Cutler & Swinney, 1987). Consequently, it is possible that prosody is an irrelevant feature of fluent reading fundamentally unrelated to reading skill at this age.\n\nProsodic features are not well dictated by text punctuation (Chafe, 1988). For example, commas may dictate pause structures for sentences like Lesley came, she saw, and she conquered, but not for sentences such as Lesley wanted the one with the red, white, and blue sprinkles. A question mark may dictate a pitch rise for the end of yes–no questions (e.g., Did Robin go?), but not usually for Wh- questions (e.g., Where did Robin go?). Moreover, oral speech usually contains more pauses than would be dictated by written punctuation, particularly for lengthy sentences that tax short-term memory. Consequently, oral readers must abstract prosodic features to a great extent while reading aloud. So, one of the tasks children have in learning how to read aloud is to learn the limitations of punctuation as a cue to the underlying prosodic structure of the text.\n\nMeasuring Prosody\n\nOne reason for the lack of information about the role of prosody in reading is the technical difficulty of measuring prosodic renderings historically. For practical reasons, fluency rating scales have often been used in lieu of direct measurements of prosody. These scales often incorporate oblique references to prosody as a way of distinguishing fluent from less fluent reading. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (2000) used a 4-point fluency scale that distinguished reading that was primarily word-by-word, with occasional 2-word or 3-word phrases that did not preserve meaningful syntax (1) from reading that was conducted primarily in larger, meaningful phrase groups, with regressions, repetitions, and deviations that did not detract from the overall structure of the story, that preserved the author's syntax, and where most of the story was read with expressive interpretation (4). Similarly, Allington (1983) used a 6-point scale that distinguished word-by-word reading (1) from reading that occurred with phrases coinciding with punctuation, appropriate semantic and syntactic emphasis, and expression that approximated normal speech (6). Zutell and Rasinski (1991) recommended breaking fluency up into three 4-point rating scales that distinguished smoothness (ranging from 1 [frequent extended pauses, hesitations, false starts, sound-outs, repetitions, and/or multiple attempts] to 4 [generally smooth reading with some breaks, but word and structure difficulties are resolved quickly, usually through self-corrections]), phrasing (ranging from 1 [monotonic with little sense of phrase boundaries, frequent word-by-word reading] to 4 [generally well-phrased, mostly in clause and sentence units, with adequate attention to expression]), and pace (ranging from 1 [slow and laborious] to 4 [consistently conversational]). These scales, however useful as they may be practically, are not direct measurements of the prosodic aspects of reading and may not enable us to disentangle the relative contributions of decoding speed and accuracy from prosodic aspects of fluent reading.\n\nResearch examining oral reading prosody directly is surprisingly sparse. The landmark study of reading prosody by Clay and Imlach (1971) used a rater to assess specific prosodic variables. Clay and Imlach analyzed pausing, pitch, and stress for a large sample of audiotaped oral reading behavior of 7-year-old children, rating each of these variables separately. They found that children who made few pauses and short pauses were the best readers according to objective assessments of skill, and the best readers completed declarative sentences with a fall in pitch.\n\nThere were a number of issues that limit the utility of the Clay and Imlach (1971) study for establishing basic findings regarding the development of reading prosody in the transition to fluent reading. First, because the technology to analyze prosody was not yet widely available, Clay and Imlach did not directly measure sound features and, instead, relied on the impressions of a single rater. These days, one can map prosodic features more or less directly using spectrographic analyses that allow one to visually represent and analyze sound waves for their pause structures, pitch peaks, and valleys, among other features. A second problem was that neither reliability nor statistical analyses were conducted on the ratings of prosody that were performed. Consequently, it is unclear whether the changes they noted were general across children and whether other issues, such as decoding problems, influenced them. Indeed, Bear (1992) found little reliability between experienced reading clinicians in their ratings of sentence-final F0 declination and word stress. Finally, a large percentage of the children Clay and Imlach studied had decoding error rates exceeding 30% and reading rates below 25 correct words per minute, so many of the children in the sample might not even be characterized as transitioning to fluency. It is hard to know whether it is possible to reliably distinguish decoding issues from prosodic ones.\n\nProsody has been examined directly in several studies. Herman (1985) electronically counted the presence of pauses exceeding 166 ms in eight remedial fourth- to sixth-grade children reading passages at a moderate level of difficulty. She found that the number of pauses not dictated by punctuation dropped considerably after the children repeatedly read the story until they reached a rate of 85 correct words per minute. However, several problems exist with this study as well. First, punctuation is only a very rough indicator of where pauses are appropriate. Second, the number of participants was quite small. Nevertheless, this study does suggest that children's appropriate pausing improves with greater reading fluency.\n\nPerhaps the best study of the development of prosodic features in children's oral reading to date is one by Dowhower (1987). Using audiotaped samples of students' reading, Dowhower studied the effect of repeated reading on oral reading prosody in second-grade children who showed adequate word decoding, but who read in a slow, word-by-word way. The mean number of inappropriate pauses, the mean phrase length, and sentence-final fall in pitch (defined as a decrease of more than 15 Hz from the peak to the final pitch) were determined. She found that, after repeated practice, the children made fewer pauses not dictated by sentence structure and showed greater sentence-final vowel lengthening (another prosodic feature demarking the ends of major syntactic units; Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980) and a larger F0 declination for the final syllables of declarative sentences.\n\nProsody and Reading Comprehension\n\nWhat these studies of reading prosody have in common is that they link improvements in reading skills to improvements in expressive oral reading. However, exactly where prosody fits in our understanding of the development of various aspects of reading skills is unclear. Nearly all would agree that the development of reading prosody is a phenomenon that occurs once decoding skills are fluent. Both Perfetti's (1985) verbal efficiency theory and, in particular, LaBerge and Samuels's (1974) automaticity theory would suggest that once words are processed fluently and automatically, resources become available for children to engage in the additional processing required for prosodic oral reading. However, the link between prosody and other aspects of the reading process is unclear.\n\nOne possibility is that reading prosody is an epiphenomenon unrelated to other important aspects of reading such as reading comprehension. For example, Karlin (1985) rated pitch, stress, and pauses in college students and found no relationship between prosody and comprehension skill. Another possibility, which we term the reading prosody as partial mediator model, is that prosody may actually assist reading comprehension. In this model, children who show rapid, accurate decoding skills should have resources available to enable prosodic reading. Thus, prosody may serve to mediate between decoding skills and comprehension to enhance comprehension. Kuhn and Stahl (2003) suggested that the development of reading prosody may assist comprehension because prosodic reading indicates that the child has segmented text according to major syntactic–semantic elements. Providing information regarding syntactic and semantic boundaries has been shown to improve comprehension in elementary school children (Cromer, 1970; O'Shea & Sindelar, 1983), and syntactic phrasing ability is somewhat related to superior comprehension in older children (Young & Bowers, 1995). Moreover, fluency ratings, which capture some elements of syntactic–semantic phrasing, seem to be related to reading comprehension skills at some level. For example, Young and Bowers (1995) found that children with higher fluency ratings tended to demonstrate at least average comprehension, decoding, and parsing skills compared with those with lower ratings. This suggests that it is important to examine the role of prosody further to determine how it fits into our conceptions of skilled reading. Consequently, this model predicts that (a) prosodic reading emerges once children have efficient decoding skills and (b) this prosody enhances reading comprehension.\n\nA second way that comprehension might be related to reading prosody is by serving as a reflection that the message has been comprehended. We call this model the reading comprehension as predictor of reading prosody model. That is, instead of prosodic reading serving as feedback to enable enhanced comprehension, enhanced comprehension might enable the child to read prosodically. Prosody, in this case, might be an indicator that the child understands what is being read. Thus, a child who can read quickly, accurately, and prosodically might be one who comprehends well. This model predicts, then, that (a) efficient decoding skills contribute to prosodic features in oral reading and (b) reading comprehension skills make an independent contribution to the prediction of prosodic features.\n\nThe current study examined the role of reading prosody with respect to decoding and comprehension skills. There were two goals of the present research: First, we wanted to characterize the development of prosodic reading as a function of reading skill based on direct measurements of reading prosody. To this end, we recorded a large number of second- and third-grade readers reading an easy-to-decode passage that had a variety of syntactic forms. Because pause structures have been central in prior research on reading prosody, we measured inter- and intrasentential pauses and variability. Sentence-final declination in pitch and general prosodic contour when matched up against adult reading were measured. Second, we wanted to test the predictions of the reading prosody as a partial mediator model and the comprehension as predictor of reading prosody model. Thus, we assessed children's decoding and reading comprehension skills using standardized assessments. We conducted several analyses that tested the potential role of reading prosody as a mediator of reading comprehension skill.\n\nGeneral Discussion\n\nThe results of this study highlight the key role of word decoding speed in reading prosodically. Our characterization of reading prosody variables suggested that, as children became skilled word decoders, reading prosody took on a culturally normative character. Children read with short pauses between sentences. There was minimal variability in their pause structures so that there was a smoothness and evenness in the way that pauses occurred between sentences. The pauses made in the middles of sentences were kept short. Skilled decoders ended their declarative sentences with a decidedly falling pitch. The pitch contours of their sentences mirrored those of adults reading the same passage.\n\nYoung readers with emerging decoding speed, in contrast, read with lengthy, sporadic pauses between sentences that gave their rendering a hesitant, start–stop quality. They read with unnecessarily long pauses in the middles of sentences where none were needed. Their sentence pitch structure was quite unlike that of a skilled adult reader, and they ended each sentence with a rather flat tone.\n\nTo the extent that our look at prosody variables overlapped with other studies, our characterization of skilled, prosodic reading is similar. Similar to Clay and Imlach (1971), we found that good readers made short pauses. We found that these short pauses were the norm both within sentences and between them. Also similar to Clay and Imlach and to Dowhower (1987), we found that good oral readers ended declarative sentences with a discernable and relatively large fall in pitch. To these observations, we add the observation that skilled oral readers matched their overall prosodic sentence contours to be like those of adults, such that it was clear that there was a prosodic target toward which children were striving. Moreover, because we made our reading prosody observations directly and without having to disregard large numbers of decoding errors, and because we made them over large numbers of children, we feel our observations help establish the generality of these observations made by others and us.\n\nThe major goal of this study, however, was to learn exactly where prosody fits in our thinking about developing reading skill. We could think of several reasonable hypotheses for how prosody might fit into our current conceptions of reading skill. We conducted structural equation model tests that depicted two distinct ways in which prosody, word decoding, and reading comprehension might be related. One model, which we called the reading prosody as partial mediator model, treated prosody as a partial mediator between decoding speed and comprehension skill. This view states that, as a child acquires automatic word decoding skills, there are attention resources that are freed up so that they are available to be allocated to higher order functions of reading (LaBerge & Samuels, 1974; Perfetti, 1985). Assuming that these resources are at least somewhat allocated to the goal of reading prosodically in oral reading situations, the natural breaks and pitch falls associated with prosodic reading may serve to provide feedback to the child regarding the major syntactic and semantic units of the text, yielding improved comprehension.\n\nThe reading prosody as partial mediator model actually has two associated subhypotheses that can be considered separately. The first of these is that fluent word decoding skills permit freeing up of attention resources so that they are available for prosodic reading. As can be seen in , evidence for this part of the model is strong. Fluent decoding skills were related to shorter, less variable intersentential pauses, shorter intrasentential pauses, steeper sentence-final pitch declines, and a more adult-like prosodic profile. The second subhypothesis is that prosody independently contributes to better reading comprehension above and beyond the contribution of word decoding speed by providing linguistic feedback to the child, which aids comprehension. This second hypothesis has less support from our data. Only one prosodic variable, child–adult F0 match, had any significant indirect relationship to reading skill, and this effect was small. Thus, we conclude that the view of prosody as an additional scaffold for comprehension has minimal support. Consequently, on the basis of the model depicted in , prosody appears to emerge mainly as an epiphenomenon of fluent word decoding skills. The additional cognitive benefits that making it sound like speech may provide are unclear from this model.\n\nWe tested a second model of the potential relationship between prosodic reading and reading comprehension skills, the reading comprehension as predictor of reading prosody model. This model assumed that prosodic reading is a reflection of good comprehension and decoding skills, such that children who are better able both to understand and to decode what they are reading are more likely to draw the appropriate syntactic and semantic emphases while they read aloud. In this model, the relationship between prosody and comprehension has been turned around so that now comprehension is viewed as a copredictor of prosodic reading with decoding speed. This model also failed to reveal much of an independent relation between enhanced comprehension and prosodic reading. Again, there was a strong relationship between Decoding Speed and WIAT-Reading Comprehension, a reduced relationship between Decoding Speed and prosody, but no significant relationships between WIAT-Reading Comprehension and any of the prosody variables.\n\nThere are, however, several important common themes that run through both modeling efforts that help us understand where prosody fits in our conceptions of developing reading skill. Like the prosody as partial mediator model, the reading comprehension as predictor of reading prosody model found evidence of a key relationship between decoding speed and reading comprehension skills. Both models suggest that automatic decoding skills are related to prosodic reading. Both models suggest that there is minimal relationship between prosodic reading and reading comprehension skills. Thus, prosodic reading would seem to serve mainly as evidence that children have automatic decoding skills.\n\nAlternatively, it may be that reading prosody actually does carry benefits for comprehension, but that our measure of reading comprehension skill was not a particularly good one. Valid and reliable assessments of reading comprehension are quite difficult to come by for this stage of reading development. Although we felt the measure we chose had appropriate psychometric properties and generally captured what many mean when they say that a child comprehends a text (that a child can answer a question about what he or she has read), it was not a sophisticated treatment of the many facets of comprehension skill. It may be that prosodic reading is unrelated only to the type of reading comprehension measure chosen here.\n\nThe WIAT was chosen as a measure of the construct of comprehension. As such, it has adequate psychometric properties. It was not connected to the passage used to measure prosody and thus was not a measure of comprehension of that particular passage. The GORT does provide questions for each passage, but we felt that the validity and reliability of the questions were not sufficient to include in our battery. Perhaps the relations between prosody and comprehension might be stronger if measured on the same passage.\n\nAlso, Kuhn and Stahl (2003) suggested that the link between prosody and comprehension might be strongest in measures of microprocessing (Kintsch, 1998). The WIAT may have measured comprehension more globally. A measure such as a cloze measure or the number of propositions recalled might also show stronger relationships. This needs to be tested in future research.\n\nAnother possibility for why we failed to find much of a relationship between reading prosody and comprehension is that we used a passage so simple and straightforward that it limited our ability to find relationships between prosody and reading comprehension. That is, a passage with more challenging content, structure, and comprehension demands may have produced different results. We agree that this, indeed, may be theoretically so, but practically it is quite difficult to find passages that are both highly decodable (an essential ingredient for measuring prosody in the first place because calculating the prosody of a reading error makes little sense) and demanding and engaging for comprehension. Highly decodable passages tend to be less interesting and demanding on the whole. Ideally, future studies might try to find such passages and have participants answer comprehension questions about that passage itself to attempt to find a more direct relationship between prosody and comprehension.\n\nHowever, we are not sure that these potential challenges to our conclusions regarding the relationship between comprehension and prosody have much merit. First, stating that our findings came about because our passage did not engage comprehension processes fully seems to assume that our participants were so bored or unchallenged by our passage that they did not read aloud in a way that was connected to meaning. Our descriptive data show otherwise. Students with mid-high and high decoding skill did indeed read prosodically at major meaning units, despite the inherent blandness of the passage. Moreover, the comprehension assessment, which was challenging, did not relate well to prosody once decoding skills were accounted for. What is important about our findings is that we found a much, much larger relationship between decoding and comprehension than prosody and comprehension. Given the relatively minuscule effect of prosody, we doubt that this basic pattern would have been dramatically altered if we had used a different passage.\n\nWe are concerned that our findings might be taken to imply that to encourage prosodic reading and reading comprehension, teachers should resort to classroom practices that solely emphasize isolated word skills. Studies that have tested this hypothesis have failed to show that teaching children to say words faster improves comprehension (Dahl, 1979; Fleisher, Jenkins, & Pany, 1979; Levy, Abello, & Lysynchuk, 1997; Spring, Blunden, & Gatheral, 1981). Although in all of these studies children's passage reading fluency improved, in none of these studies did their comprehension significantly differ from that of a control group. In these studies, children were taught to say a list of words that they could decode faster. In contrast, preteaching words that children did not know seems to improve comprehension (e.g., Tan & Nicholson, 1997). More important, assisted reading of connected text seems to have significant effects on children's comprehension (Kuhn & Stahl, 2003; National Reading Panel, 2000). This is consistent across a variety of studies in a variety of contexts. In the instructional literature, then, reading accuracy and practice in reading connected text seem to improve comprehension, but speeded isolated word decoding does not, at least in the three studies that tested its effect. Moreover, there are many reasons, cognitive, motivational, and otherwise, not to do this. Instead, our findings could be used productively with regard to classroom practice to suggest that, when children are reading prosodically, one can probably infer that they are well on their way to having automatic and fluent word decoding skills, and our instructional efforts can be placed elsewhere.\n\nIn sum, the current study has characterized some of the prosodic features that change as a child develops fluent word decoding skills. We have shown that as children become fluent decoders, they read with shorter pauses, steeper sentence-final declines, and with a more adult-like prosodic contour. We found little evidence that this prosodic reading was related to better comprehension."
