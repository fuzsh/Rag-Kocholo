        "text": "Some dreams come true. So do nightmares! If you have been wondering which of your dreams have set to become a reality, hereâs some help.\n\nThere is a pattern in the way you dream, according to ancient texts. Astrological works âHoraâ and âPrasna Margamâ and ayurveda treatise âAshtanga Hridayamâ list out the significance of your dreams and the precautions you could take to be prepared for them. Even âRamayanaâ is full of allusions to dreams.\n\nNot all dreams come true though. Some dreams are just impressions on your subconscious formed by the tensions in your mind. They will pass.\n\nBefore we get into an exhaustive list of dream symbolism, hereâs a cheat sheet to interpret any dream according the time they appear.\n\nIf you dreamt something before 9 pm, you could expect it to be a reality within one year. If the visitation was between 9 pm and midnight, you could expect a faster experience, say within six months. The later the dream comes at night, the sooner its chances of becoming a reality.\n\nA dream that appeared past midnight but before 3 am could become a reality within three months. Any dream seen before 6 am could become reality within a month and any dream seen after that could be a reality sooner than that.\n\nDreams have been classified into seven. They sometimes receive inputs from your five senses. Or they could be premonitions.\n\nDrishtam is a dream about an object that you have when you were awake.\n\nSrutham is a dream about something that you have actually heard about earlier.\n\nAnubhavam is a dream about anything you have tasted or smelled when awake.\n\nPrarthitham is a dream about something you have thought when you were awake.\n\nKalpitham is a dream related to your fantasies.\n\nBhavitham is a dream which does not fall into any of these categories. This is related to things and thoughts you are yet to experience.\n\nBhavijam is a dream as determined by the âtridoshaâ nature of your body composition.\n\nWhat you should do\n\nThese simple things could benefit you and your family.\n\nNever do anything until you have taken a bath in the morning. Bow before the gods and ancestors as soon as you wake up.\n\nDo not litter foodgrains or equipment scatter in your place of residence. Do not step over them.\n\nDo not give away milk, buttermilk, curd and sesame oil after the evening.\n\nDo not donate or lend money after sunset.\n\nDo not let brooms and baskets lean against the wall.\n\nDo not spit facing the sun, that is towards east in the morning and west in the evening.\n\nTry to grow a koovalam tree in the south or west.\n\nDo not leave your footwear near the main door of your house.\n\nDo not drain waste water to the northern side of the kitchen.\n\nLight a lamp in the morning, noon and evening. Light the lamp towards east in the morning and west in the evening.\n\nDo not look south or walk towards south in the morning.\n\nInterpretation of dreams\n\nEach of your dreams has an astrological significance. Each of them has its pros and cons. Hereâs a primer.\n\nIf you dream of a well with clear water, you can expect to gain a fortune.\n\nIf you dream of a place of worship, a pilgrimage is on the cards.\n\nIf you dream of dirty water in your house, rest assured that someone is wishing you ill. There may be diseases waiting to happen.\n\nIf you dream of staying in a cave alone, you may be at the risk of getting incarcerated. It could also be an indication of imminent insult, loss or degradation.\n\nIf you dream of a low-hanging fruit, it means just that. You are about to find livelihood.\n\nDreaming of free-falls? You can expect a fall in real life.\n\nWere you climbing a mountain in your dream or standing on top of one? You can expect to overcome the crises in your life and recover from the pitfalls.\n\nIf you dream of slipping away while trekking a hill, expect failure and ill health.\n\nIf you dream of fire, steer clear of burning objects. Someone may be wishing you ill.\n\nAlso read:Â What do these 9 dreams tell you?\n\nA lit lamp in your dream may be a portent to a pilgrimage.\n\nYou may be wary of fire if you dream of your mattress on fire.\n\nWere you crossing a sea in your dream?

Even real fire accidents are a probability.\n\nIf you dream of taking a bath, it may be a portent to a death.\n\nDream of a water cruise, and you can expect to land a cushy job or go on a trip.\n\nIf you dream of cruising in dirty water, it means something else.
