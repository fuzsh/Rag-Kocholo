        "text": "Name Reward Description Image Mountain\n\nEnergy drink The dreaming Mii will call out a phrase to a mountain in the far distance, and have it echo back. Sometimes the mountain will say something different than what the Mii initially said, surprising the Mii. Kaiju (\"Strange beast\" in Japanese)\n\nDinosaur suit The dreaming Mii, standing outside a building in the city, suddenly begins to grow several stories tall and changes into a blue-green baby suit (salmon if the dreaming Mii is female). Later, the view cuts to the dreaming Mii standing beside two buildings that must be destroyed by either punching the buildings, firing a laser, or simply running through them. A random Mii appears beside the second building watching the dreaming Mii, dressed in a dinosaur suit. Rangers 1\n\nThe superhero costume in the color the dreaming Mii was depicted in The Mii dreams of themselves and four other random islanders in superhero costumes. They will introduce themselves one by one, followed by the leader (the one depicted in red) calling out the title of the team: the Mii Rangers. Once they are done, an explosion suddenly goes off, launching all five Mii Rangers into the background. Rangers 2\n\nThe superhero costume in the color the dreaming Mii was depicted in A group of five Miis will be standing in a valley wearing superhero costumes. They will be in either a horizontal or a diagonal line and change their pose whenever the Mii in the red costumes shouts \"Ready!\" The dream continues until the player ends it manually. Freefall\n\nBungee Chord The dreaming Mii is on top of a suspended platform, overlooking a large city with a random islander behind them telling them to jump. The Mii will not jump unless they are poked by the stylus, knocking the Mii off the platform. It also reappears exclusively in the Korean version of Tomodachi Life. Concentration The food depicted in the dream Inside an ancient Japan-styled room, the dreaming Mii is found meditating with another Mii behind them equipped with a wooden rod. After a few seconds, a random food will appear in a thought bubble beside the dreaming Mii. The background Mii notices the thought bubble, and reprimands them as they whack the dreaming Mii. Come Back The food depicted in the dream The screen shows the Mii staring at a large piece of food. Tapping the Mii with the stylus will cause it to shout the food's name, then run towards it.\n\nVersion 1: Every time the Mii gets close to the food, the item teleports farther and farther away. This can be repeated until the food goes as far as it can.\n\nVersion 2: As the Mii runs towards the food, the food begins to evaporate away, then reform as they run past it. The Mii continues running forwards into the distance.\n\nVersion 3: Same as Version 2, but once the food begins to evaporate away, it will not reform, and the Mii will look towards the camera in disappointment.\n\nVersion 4: Once the Mii gets close to the food, a cage will come roaring down from above, trapping both them and the food inside. The Mii looks back towards the camera in disappointment.\n\nBirds\n\nBird's Nest The head of the dreaming Mii and two other Miis are seen tweeting with poking their heads out of a large bird's nest. Using the stylus, the player must guide the spoonful of bird feed into the Miis' mouths, which will cause them to stop tweeting for a few seconds as they eat the feed and smile. Hey, Hey, Listen!\n\nMegaphone The dreaming Mii says \"Hey, Hey, Listen!\" and says something to an animal or object. There is a version of this dream where the Mii speaks with their sweetheart before breakup. This version occurs when either Mii is depressed and dreams this particular dream. Pepper\n\nRamen The dreaming Mii stands alone on a blank screen, with nothing but a large bottle of pepper standing beside them. By picking up the pepper with the stylus, it will open up, allowing pepper to be shaken onto the Mii which will cause them to sneeze. Restroom\n\nToilet paper The dreaming Mii, desperate to use the toilet, rushes into a nearby public restroom, only to be faced by an endless row of occupied toilets. Knocking on each door will play the voice of a random Mii. Rokurokubi\n\nKitsune Udon The dreaming Mii is shown in a kimono, with a forest behind them. By dragging the Mii's face with the stylus, their neck will suddenly detach and grow longer. Rolling Head\n\nSoccer ball The dreaming Mii is shown fleeing from a giant rolling Mii head of a random islander. Levitation\n\nClock The Mii suddenly dreams of themselves sleeping, but their bed is floating above the ground. Unravel\n\nColor plain kimono The Mii is shown wearing a pink color plain kimono with their hands up in the air with a long band of fabric wrapped around them. Using the stylus, the player can pull on the fabric, pulling it off the Mii and causing them to spin in place. Spinning quickly will cause the Mii's eyes to bulge out. Space\n\nMoonstone The dreaming Mii appears in an astronaut suit floating in space. If the player taps the Mii, they will be pushed away into the distance until they cannot be seen anymore. Finger Ride\n\nBalance toy There are two bird perches on the left and right of the screen. The player must control a realistic hand to help the dreaming Mii from the left perch to the right by balancing them on their finger. The finger must be close enough for the Mii to get on and player must slowly move; if not, they will fall off and the dream will end. Once the Mii is at the top of the right perch, they will dismount the hand and smile. Edamame\n\nEdamame An edamame is shown and if the player touches any of its pods, a Mii will roll out. Once all three are popped, the dream ends. Farewell\n\nA trench coat. Color depends on the dreaming Mii was depicted in. The dreaming Mii will appear on a white background, dressed and ready for work while another Mii looks upon them. The former will say farewell to another Mii, who will promptly respond to them. After a while, the dreaming Mii will turn back and say something else to the other Mii, to which the latter also responds. This continues until the player ends the dream manually. Staring\n\nTotem Pole The dreaming Mii will appear in their room, reading out of a newspaper, with another staring at them from behind. Shortly afterwards, the dreaming Mii will turn around, and the other Mii will turn their head away. Upon asking the other Mii, the Mii will say nothing is going on as both of them return to their original positions. This continues until the player ends the dream manually. Name Reward Description Image The Future (US)\n\n20XX (EU)\n\nCane (US)\n\nWalking stick (EU) The dreaming Mii will envision themselves as an elderly person, stating that it has been 50 years since they last saw the player. Next, they will say a random statement about their age or what has happened over that time. Solar Powered (US)\n\nSolar (EU)\n\nSolar panel The dreaming Mii will be doing an exercise (specifically squatting or lifting weights) only if the solar panel hanging on top of them has enough light. Depending on how much light there is depicts the speed of the Mii's exercise. Blocking the 3DS camera will shield the sunlight, causing the Mii to stop. Getting the solar meter to the far right will make the Mii work out at a very fast speed. Unbelievable\n\nWhoopee cushion (US and EU)\n\nConch (JP)\n\nVersion 1: A friend of the dreaming Mii tells a secret that seems ridiculous and unbelievable. The dreaming Mii is shocked, bringing their face out of the world and back, only to find out that the other Mii was just pulling their leg.\n\nVersion 2: The same thing happens, except the dreaming Mii is not surprised. Instead, they tell their friend that everybody already knows this secret, leaving the latter shocked. This time, the dreaming Mii gets to tell their friend that it was a joke. If this version of the dream is experienced, it will take place in the apartment of the Mii who tells the secret rather than the dreaming Mii.\n\nTrap\n\nManhole cover\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii will fall down the hole, flip in mid-air, and land safely.\n\nVersion 2: The same thing happens as Version 1, except the Mii's body bounces out, leaving their shocked expression floating in mid-air.\n\nVersion 3: The dreaming Mii will walk towards an unnoticed hole in the ground on top screen. Once reached, they will fall into a pit on the bottom screen, with the body falling separately from the face. The body lands safely, with the face landing on the Mii's head, causing them to be shocked.\n\nVersion 4: The same thing happens as Version 3, except the dreaming Mii's body lands on its rear and bounces a bit. Their body lands sitting down, and the face lands on the body. The Mii is left with a shocked expression.\n\nHunger (US)\n\nTable (EU) The food depicted in the dream The dreaming Mii will chase after a random food item around a table in their apartment. It will be attached to a string that is attached to the Mii's back. The Mii will say various things while chasing the food item. They may even get tired and stop, run, or even try to jump at the food and catch it. Hiding\n\nA hamster outfit of a random color The Mii will dream of themselves with four other Miis attempting to hide underneath three different objects that are tied with ropes. The player can pull the ropes to reveal Miis and they run and hide under another object or attach behind the object that was lifted, only to fall off. The Miis will say various things while running with high-pitched voices. Door\n\nDoor handle The dreaming Mii will appear hanging onto a door handle with other Miis attaching to them. The player can pull onto the last-hanging Mii and release them to make the Miis bounce and say random quotes. Stick Figure\n\nBox of matches The dreaming Mii will appear with their normal head attached to a boxy body made out of black lines. The player can move the Mii around the touch screen.\n\nIn the Japanese and Korean version of the game, there is an extra string sticking out of the top of the Mii's head that the player can drag them by. In the NTSC and PAL version, the Mii is simply dragged by their head alone.\n\nDrive\n\nHula Girl(US, EU, KO)\n\nLuck Charm(JP) Two Miis drive along a dirt road in the middle of a forest until the Mii who is driving randomly stops. The passenger Mii asks \"Why are we stopping?\", the Mii driving says a comment, phrase, or asks them, then responds to the Mii who is driving. Once the two of them finished talking, they continue driving down the road, only to be stopped again for two more times, with the passenger Mii saying \"What now?\" instead of \"Why are we stopping?\" After that, the entire dream ends. The Mii who is dreaming is depicted as a bobble head on the car's dashboard (hanging charm in JP). Backpack (US)\n\nRucksack (EU)\n\nSkeleton keychain The dreaming Mii will be a keychain hanging from a random islander's backpack. Their arms and legs bounce as the character with the backpack roams through a forest. The Mii's facial expressions change depending on the movement of an islander wearing a backpack: neutral when walking, standing, or looking around, surprised when skipping, happy when walking with their arms out, and sad when shivering. In the Japanese and Korean version, the mii is suspended from the backpack by their head/neck, but in the NTSC version they are suspended by their hand/wrist. Reflection (US)\n\nMirror (EU)\n\nMarionette\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii will look in the mirror when a random islander suddenly rises from the floor in the mirror. They will look behind themselves while shivering, then look back, only to see the random islander in the reflection outside the mirror and waving at them, leaving the former shocked.\n\nVersion 2: The dreaming Mii will walk past a mirror, where their reflection will be walking backwards instead of forwards. Later, they do a double-take and run back to the mirror, only for the reflection to fall. On some occasions, the reflection is a random Mii and not the dreaming one.\n\nVersion 3: The dreaming Mii will play rock-paper-scissors with their reflection. If the Mii wins, they will celebrate while the reflection falls to the floor in dissapointment. If the Mii loses, they are the ones on the floor while the reflection is celebrating. It is possible to play the game several times.\n\nVersion 4: The dreaming Mii stares at a mirror and occasionally change their outfit. By the third time that Mii change, they see a random Mii on the reflection. The reflection jumps happily while the Mii turns around shocked.\n\nSuperhero (US)\n\nTransform (EU)\n\nMales get a robo-hero suit and females get colored superheroine costume that was depicted in the dream. (US/EU)\n\nBoth genders get the superheroine costume. (JP/KO)\n\nA friend of the dreaming Mii first appears as a fairy (with a higher-pitched voice), sending a distress call to the Mii \"hero\" to save the day. The dreaming Mii appears with a food item, saying \"By the power of [food]!\" and using their \"power\" to transform themselves to a hero, with a different hair color, and either a robo-hero suit or a superheroine costume with a heart barette (depending on gender; superheroine costume with a heart barette for both genders in Japan and Korea) revealing their alter ego. Afterwards, the hero gives children a valuable lesson that seems too far-fetched to even make sense. The dialogue and name of the hero Mii is determined by the color of their hair after transforming. Crazy Hair (US)\n\nRustly Hair (EU)\n\nComb The dreaming Mii will be on a stick (movable by the player) with stringy hair that wiggles around. If the player blows into the mic, the hair will be blown behind the Mii's head.

Factory Tour (US)\n\nFactory Visit (EU)\n\nPaint bucket (US)\n\nTin of paint (EU) Four of the dreaming Mii will be on a conveyor-belt, able to be either placed in paint of a random color or moved to the right for the next set of four. Giant\n\nSecurity camera The dreaming Mii sits in a kitchen next to a window. Suddenly, the window will open, and using the 3DS camera, the player is allowed to look through the window. If the 3DS camera detects a face, the Mii will be scared, or the Mii will stay calm if no face is detected. Ritual Random item, food, or gift depicted in the dream The dreaming Mii and nine other Miis walk around either a treasure, food, or gift, exclaiming \"All hail the [treasure/food/gift]!\" (US) or \"My [treasure/food/gift]!\" (EU) as they walk in around of the object. In the Korean version, there is a chance they might worship another Mii, and the Miis are floating on blossoms. Red thread (US)\n\nRed string (EU)\n\nRed thread(US)\n\nRed string(EU)\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii will notice a red string that will tug at them, then follows the string to the end, where a random Mii appears. The Miis then stare at each other (occasionally blinking) as the screen fades to white.\n\nVersion 2: Instead of a Mii holding onto it, the dreaming Mii will find an item at the end of string.\n\nVersion 3: There will be no item or Mii attached to the string. In that case, the dreaming Mii will continue walking with the pulling movement until they are off-screen.\n\nSneeze\n\nCold medicine\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii continuously sneezes, pushing them backwards across the screen until they are off-screen, then says \"I wonder if I'm catching a cold...\".

Next, they will turn to a Mii at random and ask about their country/king/economy, to which the Mii will respond with something positive or neutral about it. Miis will say \"darling\" after most answers, with all of the Miis (except the dreaming Mii) laughing while the mii who asked the question says \"Ha ha ha! Wonderful!\" Hide-and-Seek\n\nDowsing rods\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii will play hide-and-seek with nine other Miis, with their head against a tree and five of the Miis hiding in a tree. The former will ask \"Are you ready?\" in which the others will go into the tree and say \"Now we're ready!\" The dreaming Mii will turn around and jump, knocking all nine Miis out of the tree, leaving them surprised.\n\nVersion 2: This version occurs where there is only one hiding Mii. The dreaming Mii will ask \"Are you ready?\" in which the hiding Mii will disappear and say \"Not yet!\", \"Hold on!\", or \"Wait a minute!\" Next, the hiding Mii will re-appear somewhere else, only for the cycle to repeat.\n\nSea Monster\n\nInner tube\n\nVersion 1: The dreaming Mii will appear at the port, standing with their back facing the ocean. Another Mii's giant head will pop out of the water, with the dreaming Mii turning around scared.\n\nVersion 2: The same thing happens as Version 1, except that there are several sea monsters instead of just one.\n\nVersion 3: There is the dreaming Mii with two other normal Miis, with one or multiple sea monsters. The normal ones will hang at the side of the port and crouch down when any sea monster pops out of the water.\n\nWorkout (US)\n\nMuscles (EU)\n\nRed chili pepper (US)\n\nSpinach (EU)\n\nEnergy drink (JP, KO,) The dreaming Mii is doing push-ups when they suddenly notice a nearby food depending on version.

Seaweed\n\nFish sticks (US)\n\nFried seafood (EU)\n\nChankonabe (JP/KO)\n\nThere is a fish swimming in the ocean.
