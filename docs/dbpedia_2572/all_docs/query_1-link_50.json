        "text": "You can only reserve 50 tickets at a time online or by phone, but otherwise there is no limit.\n\nYes, tickets may be reserved online in all current markets except for those located in the state of California. Please refer to the full terms and conditions on each market page for state specific eligibility rules.\n\nThe taxes on the home are the responsibility of the winner. The IRS requires that taxes on prizes valued greater than $5,000 must be paid upon acceptance and before St. Jude may deliver the prize to the winner. Winners are encouraged to consult a tax professional.\n\nYour ticket makes you eligible for all the prizes whose deadline hasn't passed. The earlier you buy your ticket, the more prizes you're eligible for.\n\nState specific eligibility rules are listed in the full terms and conditions found on each market page. Please refer to the section titled “eligibility”. For all giveaways, you must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, whichever is older, as of the date of entry, and a living resident of the United States.\n\nThe chances of winning are based on the number of tickets sold. If fewer tickets are sold, the chances of winning improve. All tickets have an equal chance to win the house.\n\nTicket receipts will be mailed within 2–3 weeks of reservation. As the giveaway gets closer, we hope to increase the turnaround time. If an email address is provided, the ticket purchaser will receive an emailed copy within 3-5 business days that they can print for their records. It is the same as the mailed receipt, but will arrive sooner and saves St. Jude money on postage.\n\nNo, you do not have to be present to win or have your ticket receipt with you. Winners will be announced by name, not ticket number, during the televised giveaway.\n\nWe will call you on the day of the giveaway. We will also notify each winner in writing by sending a Winner Notification Agreement (“WNA”) by secure electronic communication or certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, to the email and/or mailing address provided by the ticket purchaser. Each winner must accept the prize, “as is,” by signing and returning the WNA within ten (10) days of receipt."
