They’re all nouns. And even though they may have different meanings (unless your third-grade teacher looks like a pelican), they all function in the same way, depending where they are in a sentence.\n\nWhat Is a Noun?\n\nNouns are one of the eight types of speech in the English language. They describe:\n\npeople - words used to name a person (teacher, mother, friend)\n\nincludes people’s names (Brian, Mr. Davidson, Liliana)\n\nplaces - countries, cities, or states (Canada, Los Angeles, Missouri)\n\nincludes general locations (school, supermarket, home)\n\nthings - any other item, including:\n\neveryday objects (stapler, car, dishwasher)\n\nanimals (pelican, cat, iguana)\n\nideas - words for concepts (independence, friendship, work)\n\nincludes emotions (hatred, confusion, hope)\n\nIf you can see or touch it (like cat or banana) it’s a concrete noun. If it can’t be observed with the five senses (like love or sadness), it’s an abstract noun.\n\nWhen a noun includes two words (such as birthday cake or hot dog), it’s a compound noun.\n\n10 Examples of Nouns in Sentences\n\nSeeing examples of nouns in action helps you better understand how to use the different types of nouns. Notice that if you substitute one noun with another noun, the sentences still make sense.\n\nI need to feed my new goldfish. (concrete noun naming a thing)\n\nMy aunt is staying with us for a while. (concrete noun naming a person)\n\nI am looking forward to visiting Disneyland. (concrete noun describing a place)\n\nWe are eating pizza tonight. (concrete noun naming a thing)\n\nHe needs a new computer. (concrete noun naming a thing)\n\nMy bedroom is chilly this morning. (concrete noun naming a place)\n\nSeeing my baby sister fills me with love. (abstract noun naming an idea)\n\nThis price is too high. (abstract noun naming an idea)\n\nThe server asked if I’d like to order. (concrete noun naming a person)\n\nTim really values honesty in a relationship. (abstract noun naming an idea)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Do Nouns Do?\n\nAlthough there are many types of nouns, they all do the same things in a sentence. They name things, perform actions, receive actions, and even redefine other nouns.\n\nNouns Name Things\n\nAll names of all things, such as people, cities, buildings, monuments, rivers, natural disasters, books, magazines, and songs, are nouns.\n\nWhen they’re naming something general, they’re uncapitalized common nouns. For example:\n\nman\n\ndog\n\ncountry\n\nrestaurant\n\npresident\n\nBut when they’re naming something specific, they’re capitalized proper nouns.\n\nHarvey\n\nMr. Fluffy\n\nNorway\n\nMcDonald’s\n\nPresident Eisenhower\n\nNouns Perform Actions\n\nIn a sentence, one noun performs the action (or verb). This noun is the subject of the sentence. For example:\n\nHarvey bought a shovel. (Harvey is the noun, bought is the verb)\n\nThe dog chases squirrels. (dog is the noun, chases is the verb)\n\nNorway celebrates Constitution Day. (Norway is the noun, celebrates is the verb)\n\nThat restaurant sells hamburgers. (restaurant is the noun, sells is the verb)\n\nPresident Eisenhower won the election. (President Eisenhower is the noun, won is the verb)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNouns Receive Actions\n\nWhen a noun comes after the verb, the action is happening to the noun. These nouns are the second nouns in the sentences, and they’re known as sentence objects. For example:\n\nHarvey bought a shovel. (shovel is the noun, bought is the verb)\n\nThe dogchases squirrels. (squirrels is the noun, chases is the verb)\n\nNorway celebrates Constitution Day. (Constitution Day is the noun, celebrates is the verb)\n\nThat restaurant sells hamburgers. (hamburgers is the noun, sells is the verb)\n\nPresident Eisenhowerwon the election. (election is the noun, won is the verb)\n\nNouns Redefine Other Nouns\n\nWhen nouns follow helping verbs, typically forms of is, they’re known as complements. These nouns are also known as predicate nominatives.\n\nSubject complements rename or redefine the sentence subject.\n\nHarvey was a gardener. (The noun gardener defines the noun Harvey)\n\nThe dog is a mutt. (The noun mutt defines the noun the dog)\n\nObject complements rename or redefine a sentence object.\n\nNorway is a European country. (The noun European country defines Norway)\n\nThat restaurant is a McDonald’s. (The noun McDonald’s defines that restaurant.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingular and Plural Nouns\n\nNouns can be singular (refers to one) or plural (refers to more than one).\n\nMost English nouns can be made plural simply by adding an -s to the end of the word, but there are a few irregular plural nouns that are exceptions to that rule.\n\nNouns with a singular form that ends in -s, -z, -x, -ch, or -sh need to add -es to become plural (boss/bosses, box/boxes, watch/watches, bush/bushes).\n\nCertain nouns that end in -o also need -es to become plural (potato/potatoes, hero/heroes, volcano/volcanoes).\n\nFor nouns that end in -f or -fe, change the “F” to a “V” and add -es (knife/knives, hoof/hooves, wolf/wolves).\n\nIf a singular noun ends in a single or double consonant followed by “Y,” change the “Y” to “I,” and add -es (lady/ladies, bully/bullies, spy/spies).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing Nouns With Other Parts of Speech\n\nWhen nouns aren’t naming things and performing verbs, they’re working with other parts of speech. Verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and articles work with nouns to make sentences as clear as possible.\n\nModifying Nouns With Adjectives\n\nWhen you need to describe a noun in more detail, use an adjective. Adjectives often come before the noun they’re describing, and depending which one you use, an adjective can change a lot about the noun.\n\nIn these examples, the adjective is in bold, and the noun it’s modifying is underlined.\n\nThe white truck is in the driveway.\n\nThe broken truck is in the driveway.\n\nA short customer takes out her money.\n\nAn angry customer takes out her money.\n\nAn excited octopus swims by.\n\nA dangerous octopus swims by.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReplacing Nouns With Pronouns\n\nYou can replace a noun in a sentence with a pronoun. Replace subjects with subjective pronouns (such as I, you, he, she, it, or they).\n\nThe white truck is in the driveway.\n\nIt is in the driveway.\n\nA customer takes out her money.\n\nShe takes out her money.\n\nSome octopuses swim by.\n\nThey swim by.\n\nUsing Articles With Nouns\n\nUse an article before a noun to point out which one you're talking about. Indefinite articles (a or an) come before a general, nonspecific noun.\n\nA truck is in the driveway.\n\nA customer takes out her money.\n\nAn octopus swims by.\n\nBut when the definite article the comes before a noun, you’re talking about a specific noun.\n\nThe truck is in the driveway.\n\nThe customer takes out her money.\n\nThe octopus swims by.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPractice Your Noun Knowledge\n\nKnowing what a noun is and knowing how to use one can be two different skills. See how much you’ve learned with some noun worksheets and noun quizzes."
