        "text": "Psychologists, such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, have long theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams. But other experts believe dreams don’t have much meaning.\n\nSome dreams slip away like minnows when you wake up and hazily try to grasp at them. Others remain vivid in your memory, so clear and unforgettable that, as the days pass, you might start to wonder if you actually dreamed them more than once.\n\nEven if you don’t remember many (or any) of your dreams, you do still have them. While experts still have plenty to discover about dreams, they do generally agree that dreaming is part of the human experience.\n\nYou can cover a lot of ground in your dreams. Common experiences include:\n\nsexy encounters with a crush\n\nordinary activities, like doing chores or buying groceries\n\nterrifying experiences, like returning to high school or being chased by monsters\n\ngaining superpowers or magical abilities\n\nWhether your dreams are mundane or peculiar, you might want to know if they have any deeper significance. Experts haven’t come up with a clear answer, but you’ll find some main theories below — along with a few tips for decoding your own dreams.\n\nPlenty of psychologists and other experts have theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams.\n\nFreud’s theory of unconscious wish fulfillment\n\nPsychologist Sigmund Freud had a lot to say about dreams (and not all of it related to sex).\n\nHe suggested that dreams helped protect people from waking up early when light or sound disrupted their sleep, but he also believed dreams pointed to buried desires.\n\nYour sleeping brain creates what he called a “manifest dream” from snippets of everyday images, experiences, and memories. The manifest dream simplifies, reorganizes, and masks the “latent dream,” or your repressed and unconscious wishes.\n\nIn other words, the manifest dream uses various symbols and bizarre or unusual images to conceal the latent dream, or what you’re really dreaming about.\n\nJung’s theory of compensation and self-portrayal\n\nLike Freud, Carl Jung believed dreams had meaning. Jung focused on specific archetypes, or patterns, that appear symbolically in dreams, theorizing that dreams could help explain daily events and balance out aspects of yourself you aren’t aware of yet.\n\nSay, for example, you have a lighthearted relationship with your partner. You enjoy the same hobbies, have great sexual chemistry, and get along well — but you can’t shake the feeling that something deeper’s missing from your relationship.\n\nOne night, you dream the two of you are reviewing housing listings, wandering through the furniture section of a department store, and then, suddenly (in the abrupt nature of dreams), taking a leisurely walk through a quiet park.\n\nUpon waking, you might realize your dream exposed some of the more mundane things absent in your relationship, while also suggesting you might want a relationship that includes thoughtful planning for the future along with fun.\n\nOther key theories\n\nOther dream researchers have offered their own theories as to the meaning of dreams.\n\nPsychologist Calvin S. Hall considered dreams part of the cognition process, or a type of thinking that happens as you sleep.\n\nSince the images that appear in dreams reflect elements of daily life, Hall believed dreams could offer important insight into how you view yourself and others, your problems and conflicts, and the world in general.\n\nLinguist and philosopher George Lakoff believed dreams offered a metaphorical glimpse into daily challenges and life events. In other words, the abstract symbols appearing in your dreams represent real hardships.\n\nPsychologist and dream researcher Rosalind Cartwright also tied dreams to significant life events and emotional experiences. She believed dreams played an important role in cognitive processes, including memory and emotion regulation.\n\nProfessor G. William Domhoff also connected dreams to daily experiences. The things you do and think about during the day can resurface in dreams, he suggested, while your emotional mindset helps shape their unique content.\n\nDomhoff also noted that, although dreams may shed some light on heavy concerns, they might not have any real purpose. You forget most of your dreams, after all.\n\nWilliam Dement, who helped found the field of sleep medicine, similarly suggested that, while dreams may lack a clear purpose, they can still convey meaningful messages.\n\nMany experts don’t believe dreams have much meaning, but believe they still serve a purpose.\n\nExisting theories outline a few of these purposes.\n\nThreat simulation theory\n\nSome researchers suggest that dreams serve an important evolutionary purpose.\n\nAccording to threat simulation theory, dreams offer the chance to practice identifying, avoiding, and dealing with potential threats. By safely handling these threats in your dreams, you might feel safer in your waking life.\n\nResearch from 2009 found some support for this theory by comparing dreams of children who had experienced trauma with children who hadn’t.\n\nOf course, threat simulation theory can also tie into other theories about dream meaning. Traumatized children could, for example, have more threatening dreams, because they often feel afraid in daily life.\n\nActivation-synthesis theory\n\nAccording to the activation-synthesis theory, dreams are nothing more than a collection of random images and thoughts, projected during sleep as a result of normal brain activity.\n\nThese images don’t follow any narrative structure, thanks to the pons, your brain’s random dream generator. You create the story of your dream on your own, after waking up.\n\nSupporters of this theory believe dreams can feel strange, because these random images often make little sense when they’re combined.\n\nDreams as emotional regulation\n\nThe unpleasant or unwanted emotions you experience in daily life can pop up in your dreams, too.\n\nAnxiety, guilt, sadness, or fear can quickly get overwhelming. But some experts have theorized that navigating these feelings in dreamland can help you begin resolving these feelings without all the stress.\n\nWondering how that might work? Well, when you dream during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, the parts of the brain that help regulate emotion and memory are active.\n\nWhat’s not active is the chemical messenger noradrenaline, which can produce feelings of anxiety or stress.\n\nContinual-activation theory\n\nYour brain doesn’t completely shut down when you go to sleep. Instead, it uses this time to carry out important processes, including transferring short-term memories into long-term storage.\n\nAs you sleep, your brain also takes out the trash, in a manner of speaking, by getting rid of all the leftover, unnecessary information.\n\nAs your unconscious brain focuses on processing memories, activity in your conscious brain slows way down.\n\nAccording to the continual-activation theory, this prompts your brain to send a flow of data from memory storage into the conscious brain. You can think of this data — aka your dreams — as a sort of screensaver keeping the conscious part of your brain up and running, despite the lack of actual activity.\n\nNo matter what scientific theories might suggest, people around the world have long believed in the significance of dreams and attempted to guess their meanings.\n\nDreams may seem so intriguing in part because they’re not fully understood. But certain dreams show up so often across generations and cultures that many people believe these common themes suggest that dreams do, in fact, have significance.\n\nHere are some common dream themes, plus possible interpretations:\n\nA dream aboutCould meancheating on your partneryou’re having a hard time getting your needs met in the relationship, or you feel trapped in another area of your lifeyour partner cheatingyou feel afraid of losing your partner or rejection in another area of lifefailing a testyou’re facing some stress that you don’t feel ready to handlebeing naked or experiencing other public embarrassmentyou feel vulnerable and worry other people will notice your flawsdiscovering money or treasureyou feel confident, worthy, and good about yourselfmissing your bus or trainyour everyday life leaves you frustrated and you believe you’re lacking something importantlosing your teethyou’re worried about aging, or you have insecurities around how other people perceive youfinding new roomsyou’re discovering new abilities, interests, or future possibilities for yourself fallingyou feel unsupported by loved ones, or as if you’re losing control over some aspect of your lifedyingyou’re facing some unwelcome changes or you have some uncertainties about the future\n\nReady to dig a little deeper into your dreams? These strategies can help.\n\nMake sure you’re getting quality sleep\n\nRemembering your dreams is an important part of deciphering them.\n\nDream recall may happen more naturally when you get enough sleep. Aim for about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night to get the right amount of REM sleep. This may, in turn, boost dream recall.\n\nTip\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, try repeating to yourself, “I’m going to dream vividly, and I’m going to remember those dreams when I wake up.”\n\nReview the dream\n\nWhen you wake up from a dream, your first instinct might be to reach for your dream journal. Instead, lie still for a moment and let the dream really marinate.\n\nAs you let each scene that comes to you unfold, try to open your awareness to any thoughts or feelings you experienced during the dream.\n\nAs you think back over the events of the dream, pay attention to any small details that stand out. They might seem minor in the light of day, but it’s very possible they had more significance in your dream.\n\nWrite it down\n\nOnce you’ve taken yourself through the dream, grab a notebook and write down everything you can remember. As you write, you might remember more key details that help shape the dream narrative.\n\nJot down everything you can think of — even if you aren’t sure exactly what happened. You might write, for example, “Wandering through forest alone, searching for someone or something. Not sure, but I felt lost and lonely.”\n\nKeep track of details, like:\n\ncolors and sounds\n\nother people in the dream\n\nanything you said or heard someone else say\n\nbuildings or places you visited\n\nmoods and feelings\n\nkey objects in the dream, like cars, weapons, tools, or books\n\nTip\n\nKeep a notebook and small lamp on your nightstand to make this process easier, especially if you tend to wake up in the middle of the night.\n\nEven getting out of bed to find some paper can end up jarring fragments of the dream from your mind.\n\nMake connections to your own life\n\nBooks that offer dream interpretations can be helpful, but you’ll often gain more insight by examining the dream from the unique lens of your experiences.\n\nPeople have plenty of things to say about their own dreams, but someone else’s meaning might not hold true for you.\n\nMaybe you dream about a rabbit eating grass in the park. At first, this might seem like a simple, even somewhat boring dream. But, when you dig a little deeper, you remember feeling happy and peaceful in the dream, and that you wanted a pet rabbit as a child.\n\nConnecting these facts to your everyday life, you might conclude that spending time outside felt good and decide to visit the park more often. You also realize you’d enjoy having a pet in your life.\n\nNo one knows for certain what purpose dreams serve. But, at the end of the day, their true function might not really matter.\n\nIf you find them meaningful, then they have value to you.\n\nCrystal Raypole has previously worked as a writer and editor for GoodTherapy.
