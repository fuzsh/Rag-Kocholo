        "text": "It's Sleep Awareness Week from March 8 to March 14, and Allure is talking all things rest, from what happens when we don't get enough to how to make the most out of our time between the sheets.\n\n\"I had a wild dream last night.\" It's a phrase I hear from friends at least a couple of times per week, and the roundtable conversation that ensues is one that I'm rarely able to participate in. Because here's the thing: I don't really dream. As a kid, I had plenty of vivid dreams, many of them nightmares that I can recall in detail to this day. But for some reason, the second I became a teenager, they all but ceased entirely. Now, at the age of 25, being able to remember a dream — or even getting that gut feeling I've had a dream at all — on any given morning is a rarity for me.\n\nMy rigid internal clock forces my body into sleep and forces it back awake at almost the same time every night and day, regardless of whether I'm using an alarm. I imagine that the moments just after I've fallen asleep look similar to the way they do for you: an endless black abyss. Sleep takes hold of me quickly, and when it happens all I see is that darkness for what feels like a few moments before I'm waking back up. My brain rarely wanders off into other territories during sleep, at least to my knowledge.\n\nWhen I admit this to people, it's automatically written off as some sort of quirky trait, but I've always been curious and a little bit worried about it. Vivid dreams are often thought of as a source of inspiration or a characteristic of naturally creative people — it can feel strange to lack that when you pay your rent by putting words to metaphoric paper.\n\nEvery now and then I wonder: If I'm not dreaming, is there something inherently wrong with me? Is it possible to sleep wrong, and am I doing that? Can not dreaming lead to cognitive issues for me in the future? I asked sleep experts to help me piece together the answers so I can finally put those worrying thoughts to bed.\n\nSo, what's the point of dreaming, anyway?\n\nMy concerns about the fact that I rarely recall having dreams is hinged to one foundational question: Does dreaming serve any physical or mental benefit that the sleep itself doesn't? According to Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine, doctors have gathered evidence surrounding multiple hypotheses about this. Dreaming, he says, has multiple functions, according to research, but he likens the primary and most recently discovered one to the tiny wastebasket that sits underneath your office desk and gets emptied after you've left for the night.\n\n\"All day long, you're bombarded with information — and what helps us adapt to the outside world is the ability to take this new information, integrate it into the previous things that we've learned, and make these connections,\" he explains. \"So you need to remember some things, but you also need to forget some things; dreaming is a situation of remembering and forgetting simultaneously.\"\n\nWhat Pelayo means is that, in layman's terms, your brain needs to be able to reprioritize information depending on how relevant it is to you at a given time. He gives the example of a person who lives around lions (strange, I know, but bear with me). A person living around lions would likely categorize cats as dangerous. Therefore, that person would need to remember specific characteristics of a lion, like its smell, so that they can avoid the danger of running into one. If that person moved to another area where there are no lions but plenty of domestic cats, their brain would need to forget certain details about lions in order to make room for new ones about other cats. Dreaming would be a part of that process.\n\nKelly Baron, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in the division of public health at the University of Utah, offers a similar sentiment on the purpose of dreams, which mostly occur during rapid eye movement (or REM) sleep. \"It is thought that REM sleep is involved in re-activating memories and helping cement pathways in the brain between short-term and long-term memory formation,\" she explains.\n\nThat theory on dreaming's purpose is heralded by Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He's also the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science. He delves deeper into his findings of the benefits of dreaming in his book, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, but in short, he equates dreaming to emotional therapy.\n\n\"Dreaming has the potential to help people de-escalate emotional reactivity, probably because the emotional content of dreams is paired with a decrease in brain noradrenaline,\" he writes in UC Berkeley's Greater Good Magazine. In other words, dreaming \"allows us to re-process upsetting memories in a safer, calmer environment.\" It also helps the brain \"cogitate vast swaths of acquired knowledge and then extract overarching rules and commonalities,\" just as Pelayo and Baron summarize.\n\nSome sleep experts will tell you, based on the scientific evidence, that we do need to dream in some capacity — or, at the very least, we need REM sleep for cognitive function. \"If you don't have dreams, you probably would still function, but you may not function as optimally as you could is the thinking behind this [hypothesis],\" Pelayo explains.\n\nOK, then why aren't I dreaming?\n\nYou likely already know a little bit about REM sleep from your middle-school science textbooks. You usually have multiple REM cycles overnight wherein your eyes twitch, you breathe heavily, and your muscles relax into an almost paralytic state. The last REM cycle of the night, which happens in the final few hours of sleep, is when Pelayo says a majority of dreams happen.\n\nBecause of this, he says people like me who aren't recalling many dreams ought to examine the amount and timing of REM sleep they're getting to gauge why that is. By his logic, less REM sleep equals fewer possibilities for dreams to occur. Still, there's a really important distinction between not dreaming at all and simply not being able to remember your dreams. As Baron explains: \"People are probably having REM sleep even if they don't remember it.\"\n\nHearing this sent a pang of relief racing through me — I realized I must be having enough REM sleep, and not remembering my dreams doesn't really matter. I consistently sleep seven or eight hours a night, and my sleep is mostly undisturbed despite the never-ending flux of car horns and sirens in my neighborhood. On top of that, the time I fall asleep (usually midnight) and the time I wake up (seven or eight in the morning) is pretty consistent, too. Like I mentioned earlier, my internal clock has a strong grip on my body.\n\nAfter telling Pelayo this, he assures me that I'm probably having dreams frequently, I'm just not waking up at a time that allows me to remember said dreams. He points me toward the work of William Dement, the founder of Stanford's Sleep Research Center, to better explain. Dement is one of the researchers who made early connections between dreaming and REM sleep, and his studies find that people typically don't remember a dream unless they wake up while it's occurring.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Sleep Review Magazine by The Journal for Sleep Scientists, Dement describes his study that initially linked dream disruption to dream recall: \"It was very clear from the awakenings that when you’re dreaming, about 80 percent of the time, the subject would remember a vivid dream from the awakening,\" he says.\n\nPoint being: If like me, you consider yourself to be a good sleeper and still rarely experience dreams, you're probably just sleeping through them. Otherwise, the issue isn't whether or not you're dreaming — it's whether or not you're sleeping well enough in the first place. \"I never saw a patient who came in for only lack of dreaming,\" says Baron. \"They usually have insomnia and feel like their sleep quality is poor overall. In their case, a lack of dreaming is more of a consequence of overall poor sleep.\"\n\nAnd if you're not dreaming because you're not getting quality REM sleep, that's where other health issues come into play. \"People [who are not having REM sleep] may be tired, they may be sleep-deprived, and they have very wide fluctuations in how they're feeling,\" Pelayo says.\n\nAdditionally, studies have connected poor quality of sleep to a higher risk of heart disease, obesity, and even Alzheimer's Disease. With that in mind, people having difficulty sleeping over a long period of time should consult with a doctor.\n\nHow can I tell if I'm not dreaming versus not remembering my dreams?\n\nPelayo has a simple way to determine if you're just sleeping through your dreams: wake up earlier. Buying a sleep tracker can help you determine if and when you're having REM sleep, he says — once you've figured out what times you're likely to be in REM, all you have to do is set an alarm during that time. \"The whole point is that you try to interrupt your sleep,\" he says. \"Then you should have more dream recall.\"\n\nAnd because most dreaming happens in the final hours of sleep, you might not need to wake up much earlier than normal to catch a dream before it ends. \"Once you know that you really have REM, then you can probably just set your alarm for one hour earlier,\" Pelayo predicts. When I think about the few dreams that I do remember, this makes all the sense in the world. Those dreams are always the ones that seem to end abruptly — the ones that make me feel like I'm being physically thrashed out of my brain at four or five in the morning.\n\nI thankfully discovered from Pelayo's alarm trick that I do, indeed, have REM and dreams that I've just been sleeping through. If you end up using a sleep tracker to track your own REM sleep, though, Baron advises taking its readings with a grain of salt. \"I think the use of sleep trackers makes people worry they are not getting enough REM sleep,\" she warns. \"Even if your tracker says that you are getting less than average, it doesn't mean you have a sleep problem. There can be some variation in how much REM an individual gets, even in a healthy sleeper.\"\n\nIs there anything wrong with not remembering dreams?\n\nAn inability to dream due to an overall sleep deficiency might be a cause of concern to experts — but what about sleeping through dreams? Can I still reap all those emotional and cognitive benefits from dreams if I'm barely aware that I'm even having them? When asked, Pelayo and Baron both assure me that sleeping through dreams and failing to recall them is totally normal.\n\n\"Whether you remember your dreams or not is actually not a sign of whether your sleep is healthy,\" Baron says. Pelayo adds that the most important thing is that I'm getting quality sleep at all. \"If you wake up in the morning refreshed, then you're probably sleeping just fine, and there's nothing abnormal about it.\"\n\nCue a massive sigh of relief from me. I definitely won't be waking myself up at ungodly hours in order to remember my dreams more often, but at least I can rest easy knowing they're happening when they ought to be. I'll probably continue missing out on all those group conversations about the dreams people had the night before — but I'm thankfully not missing out on dreaming, period.
