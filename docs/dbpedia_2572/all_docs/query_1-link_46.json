        "text": "If you've been having some vivid and maybe kinda scary dreams, you’re not alone. Maybe you’re here specifically because you’re having a recurring nightmare where you’re face to face with a boa constrictor, and wondering what that could mean.\n\nWell, if you’re dreaming of snakes, (*especially* getting bit by one) and you wake up thinking, “this has to be about my ex ~slithering~ into my DMs,” you’re not wrong.\n\nRegardless of what exactly is going on, this isn’t a dream you’re supposed to forget about. Discover all the possible explanations as to why you might be having snake dreams.\n\nWhat do most dreams about snakes mean?\n\nMost likely, dreaming about snakes is your subconscious sending you a message that a person or situation you’re involved with is, well, pretty toxic, says certified psychic medium and dream analyst Nicole Bowman, an advisor by the name of on Keen.com.\n\nThat’s not the only meaning, though. The snake bite or apparition could be a wake-up call about something in your life that’s been slipping from your attention, or it could be a sign that you’re going to be “shedding a layer of skin” in some aspect of your life (which, we could all use a rebirth after 2020). “Generally, when you’re dreaming of animals or nature that’s typically because you’re going through some kind of cycle of transformation,” Bowman says. And, those hiking first dates you’ve been going on may also have something to do it.\n\nUltimately, these types of dreams represent our fears coming to light, Bowman points out. Anxieties about health (and work, and politics, and relationships) are completely normal. Dreaming about snakes might even be connected to your breathing or lungs, and stress associated with it.\n\nWhat does it mean if I dream about a snake biting me?\n\nIn a situation where the snake is chasing you or biting you in your dream, this is a warning to be aware of your surroundings, Bowman says. Specifically, you might have some betrayal or infidelity on your hands. (Color me surprised that my cheating ex is appearing in the form of a snake). “Snakes are low to the ground and what they do is hidden, so if you’re not looking, you might miss it,” Bowman says. Basically, it’s a sign to listen to your gut instincts.\n\nThe size and type of the snake could indicate the size of the issue at hand, Bowman adds. So for instance, if it’s a garter snake, it could signify something fairly harmless going on, she says. But if your dream includes a rattlesnake or any other kind of deadly snake, do not leave your bed without evaluating what TF is going on in your waking life.\n\nSometimes the snake “bite” could be self-inflicted, Bowman points out. You could be going through a series of changes, which is totally normal and not a negative thing, but this is just a call to pay attention to your own life choices and how they’re affecting you.\n\nAll that said, Machiel Klerk, a licensed mental health therapist, dream interpreter, and author of Dream Guidance, notes that dream interpretation is highly personal. “Dreamwork is an art and not a science,” he says. “It depends a lot on the context.” In other words, the dream’s message will be different depending on the person’s past experiences, associations, and feelings with what they’re dreaming about, in this case, snakes. So take the archetypal meaning of snake bites in, but also take into account your own experience with them as you interpret your snake dreams. For instance, dreaming about getting bit by a snake may mean something completely different to someone who loves snakes compared to someone who was bit in the past and is terrified of them.\n\nEek, what if I’m having recurring dreams about snakes?\n\nIf the snake dream is just a one-time thing, it’s just a tiny red flag of something going on in your life and probably nothing major to worry about, says Bowman.\n\nOn the other hand, if it’s happening repeatedly, there could be something more going on. “Look at your inner circle and at whom you can trust,” Bowman says. It’s especially important to stay on guard in workplace settings, as not everyone there is going to always have your best interest in mind. This isn’t to make you paranoid, Bowman says, but to make you aware of your surroundings.\n\nIs there any positive meaning of a snake dream?\n\nThe negative stereotypes almost always associated with snakes persist from biblical references, Bowman notes (thanks a lot, Eve). But it’s not necessarily a sign of evil entering your inner circle. “If it’s not biting you, a snake represents rebirth and renewal—snakes shed their skin and then they’re renewed,” Bowman says. This can be a good sign for a new job or a new relationship, or for a sense of relief and healing after getting out of a relationship. It’s important to have a mental reset, says Bowman. “We have to re-evaluate who we want to be.”\n\nAlso, interestingly, it’s not always a bad omen when a snake bites you, Bowman points out. In certain cultures and traditions, snake venom is thought to have healing properties. This type of dream could symbolize that something you’re going through is trying and challenging, but you will heal and make it through. “What seemed like your downfall could be a triumph,” Bowman says.\n\nWhat does it mean if I dream about snakes while pregnant?\n\nBecause snakes are associated with renewal and transformation, it makes perfect sense to dream about them during pregnancy, during which your body and life are quite literally experiencing a major metamorphosis. In this scenario, Klerk says the message is to embrace and embody the snake’s transformational energy, meaning let go and allow the wisdom of your body to do its thing during pregnancy.\n\nWhat does it mean if I dream about a boa constrictor?\n\nBoa constrictors, while nonvenomous, can be just as frightening to spot in your dreams, given that they have the power to squeeze their prey to death. Their appearance in a dream symbolizes a feeling of suffocation, Klerk says. For instance, maybe there is a space in your life (literally or metaphorically) that makes you feel like the walls are closing in on you. Or, he adds, the dream could mean that you are making someone else feel trapped in some way. If you’re unsure where the suffocating energy is, he suggests examining the details of the dream to help give you some clues as to what areas need some space.\n\nWhat does it mean if I dream about a rattlesnake?\n\nRattlesnakes, on the other hand, are poisonous, Klerk says, so the message there is to be careful and be on the lookout for someone or some experience that may not be best for you. The specifics of the dream, such as the location and the storyline can provide symbolic (and in some cases literal) details about where the poisonous “rattlesnake” may be popping up in your life.\n\nStill, remember that poison can also be a form of medicine and symbolize healing. So dreaming about a rattlesnake isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “There is something to be learned and experienced in the situation,” Klerk says. “By understanding the situation better, a person will be wiser, even if the experience felt like a nasty bite.”\n\nWhat does it mean if I dream about many snakes?\n\nWhen your dream stars not one but many snakes, Klerk says that points to fear or feeling threatened in some way. His advice? Evaluate whether or not the fear is actually valid. If the thing you feel threatened by isn’t safe, then the best course of action is to avoid it. On the other hand, if the thing you’re afraid of can improve your life in some way but you’re just hesitant to take the leap, like starting a business, for example, take steps to move towards the fear rather than run away from it.\n\nHow do I stop snake nightmares from happening?\n\nThe whole point is of this dream is to get your attention. So the first step is to not ignore these signs! Bowman suggests meditating and journaling on this question of what you might be ignoring or neglecting in your life. But if these dreams are causing you to have trouble sleeping or getting back to sleep, try using peaceful essential oils or tea containing lavender, she says.\n\nAlso, try tracking your dreams by keeping a journal to analyze the meaning. As soon as you wake up from a dream like this, jot it down, Bowman says, so that you can remember the message your subconscious is trying to send you when you’re less groggy. Often, it’s been slithering right under your feet the whole time."
