        "text": "All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. Edgar Allan Poe\n\nI imagine that when the 2010 movie, Inception, was pitched to Warner Brothers, the conversation would have abounded with phrases such as “invasion of the subconscious”, “dream control” and “alternate reality”. But what struck me most with this movie, as the confusing layers of consciousness unfolded and merged, was just how familiar … how spiritual … the whole concept was to me.\n\nAre we actually awake, or do we exist in a dream?\n\nFor years, in my meditations, writings and conversations, I have pondered and explored the idea of alternate consciousness — the supposition that our reality, in fact, may just be a dream. Another layer of human consciousness, with its own set of physical and temporal rules.\n\nTo the skeptical and those with more tangible tastes this notion must seem absurd, but the theory of a dream-reality is certainly not without merit and clues of its existence have crept into the collective psyche almost unnoticed.\n\nThe Matrix Trilogy took the concept of reality-as-we-know-it and smacked us clean in the face with it — offering an enticing glimpse of how humans literally could bumble along in their ignorance, and be completely unaware of their sleep-state. The TV series, Life on Mars, explored the world of dreams, (as did Inception), and introduced the very real concept that we never actually know when we’re dreaming!\n\nRow, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily … life is but a dream.\n\nScientifically, consciousness has become the next great frontier, and already theories are arising that our individual minds are, in fact, part of a larger universal mind; the Mind of God, or higher consciousness.\n\nAnthropologically, indigenous Australians regard the creation of the physical world as, literally, “the dreaming” and throughout Indian and Buddhist populations, people seek to find — not enlightenment — but “bodhi”; awakening. The same is true for the Native Americans, who await the Great Awakening.\n\nIt poses the question, if we are moving towards an awakening, what are we doing now? Are we in some form of sleep state? Are we simply unaware that we’re dreaming? When we die and our spirit — our energy or essence— undoubtedly departs our body, is it that we … wake up?\n\nThis notion that life — reality — is simply one of many levels of consciousness also explains and adds weight to the growing Law of Attraction movement. According to Abraham via Gary and Esther Hicks, “You are the only one who creates in your experience — no one else. Everything that comes to you comes by the power of your thought”. This sentiment is echoed in The Magician’s Way, by Australian William Whitecloud, and through Rhonda Byrne’s global phenomenon, The Secret. Essentially, the message is that you control your experience, your environment and your eventual destiny.\n\nPerhaps … just perhaps … our true reality lies in another consciousness altogether and, just as with the visions of our nightly slumber, we are unaware of the freedom at our fingertips. The freedom to “wake up” to our dream state, live more lucidly and start molding this dream to our own desires.\n\nIt is our time. We are awakening out of a seemingly eternal sleep. We were once awake and are returning to that state. John Kimmey, Native American Church of North America"
