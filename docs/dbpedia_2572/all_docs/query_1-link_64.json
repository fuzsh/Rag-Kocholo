        "text": "The reason I ask is that I dreamed of an old friend of mine named Allison last month. Then I dreamed of her again last week and then again three days ago.\n\nThe dreams have been vivid and were very similar.\n\nAllison is an old friend and not somebody I’ve been in touch with in over eight years.\n\nWhy am I now dreaming of her?\n\nYou miss them\n\nAllison and I met at a youth hostel in Italy the summer of 2015.\n\nI shared a love of indie music and Renaissance art with this young woman and was immediately surprised by the strength of our connection.\n\nShe was from New Zealand, and myself from the UK.\n\nI was initially captivated by her Kiwi accent and azure blue eyes, but the connection became so much more than that.\n\nWe were both traveling with friends and our friend groups meshed naturally.\n\nOur friend groups soon started going out regularly in the several weeks.\n\nWe all ended up traveling together by train, bus and boat through Greece as well as Italy, an epic trip for the ages.\n\nFriendships were made and brief romances were kindled, although Allison wasn’t single as I would come to find out after a night of making out and her subsequent guilt.\n\nThe really remarkable thing that happened was the depth of our friendship.\n\nWe were comfortable just being silent and talking.\n\nWe’d split our earbuds and each listen in one ear to the latest song that we were in love with.\n\nI didn’t feel pressure to define our relationship or even for it to be more.\n\nWe were friends, and for once that really meant something.\n\nThe backdrop of traveling through Italy and Greece didn’t hurt either:\n\nI could say it wasn’t like all those corny rom-coms and comedies set in Europe, but it kind of was.\n\nFor us in our mid-20s it was a dream.\n\nEventually real life took over. I’d like to say the strength of our connection was enough to keep us in touch, but Allison got married and became very busy with a career and then had a baby. Then another.\n\nI was thrilled and we exchanged all sorts of emails and messages, but eventually our regular lives took over.\n\nBut I still remember that Italian dream…\n\nAnd now, almost a decade later having these repeated dreams about Allison has me wondering why.\n\nThe most likely explanation is obvious:\n\nSome part of me misses her and misses the connection we have.\n\nSo much has changed since that time, but so much has also stayed the same, and those memories certainly haven’t gone away.\n\nThe most common reason you dream of someone you don’t talk to anymore is that you miss them.\n\nCertain friends, exes, relatives and people we meet in life leave a deep imprint on our psyche for better or for worse.\n\nSometimes dreaming of them can be as simple as really missing them.\n\nThe fact is that this dream did remind me of how much I actually do miss Allison, even though we lost touch.\n\nBut there was also more to it, which I’ll get to.\n\nIf you’re dreaming of someone you no longer talk to, start with the possibility you miss them, but also work your way down to determine if there could be more to it.\n\nYou are worried about them\n\nWhen you dream of someone you no longer talk to, it can also be a sign that you are subconsciously worried about them.\n\nThere may be bad news you got about them or worries you have about what’s going on in their life.\n\nIn my case there was nothing I’d heard about Allison or reason I had to be worried about her.\n\nShe’s doing quite well so far as I know, and the odd year that we shoot over an email everything is perfectly normal and fine.\n\nBut if you are dreaming about somebody who’s not in your life anymore, it could be a sign that you have anxiety over their well-being.\n\nIt can also point to deeper anxieties about your own life path or state of being, in that you may miss how things were when they were around.\n\nIf you’re worried about this person it will generally manifest as waking up with a clammy, dreadful feeling as if something bad is happening and you’re not quite sure what.\n\nIn such cases it can indeed be advisable to try to reach out to this person and check if all is well via messages or phoning.\n\nYou have unfinished business with them\n\nIn general, dreaming of a person you don’t talk to anymore means you have unfinished business.\n\nIn the first possibility I went through how you might miss them. This could mean getting back in touch, or it could mean reflecting on the qualities you admired in that person and seeking them out in new relationships.\n\nUnfinished business can also mean you are worried about this person and something is intuitively telling you that they may not be well.\n\nThe next possibility here is that you have unfinished business in the painful sense: one of you hurt the other or a misunderstanding or fight took place.\n\nSome kind of hurt that marred the past has been lurking inside you and now it’s reemerging in dreams, urging you to resolve it in order to clear your conscience and be able to move forward.\n\nAs Ryan Hart writes:\n\n“Dreaming about someone usually means you have some unfinished business with that person.\n\nYou’re worried about something he or she did, said, or didn’t do or say to you.\n\nIt could be events in the past or an emotional issue.”\n\nIf you have painful business to resolve with someone from the past it can be easy to just avoid.\n\nBut if possible, you should get in touch and try to see if you can talk it through or even meet.\n\nEven after many years, misunderstandings and past pain can still be raw, and we often underestimate the ability of a few kind words and a desire to make amends and how big of a difference that can make.\n\nYou have romantic feelings for them…\n\nAnother option is that your unfinished business is romantic in nature.\n\nAllison and I did have some sparks fly and we shared a nice kiss or two.\n\nBut we didn’t sleep together and I never really felt like I fell in love in the full sense.\n\nStill, I have to admit that there was always an element of romance there and that I had a strong desire for her from the first day we met.\n\nIf you’re dreaming of someone you don’t talk to anymore, you want to definitely take an honest look at your emotional inventory and see if you have some romantic or sexual feelings for them.\n\nWhat you do about that if you find there is is up to you, but it’s important to be honest with yourself so you don’t leave unresolved feelings or pain unresolved and unfaced.\n\nThey’re dreaming of you as well\n\nIf you’re dreaming of someone you don’t talk to anymore, it’s sometimes because they’re also dreaming of you.\n\nThis phenomenon of shared dreaming is a very real phenomenon.\n\nWhen two people are sharing a dream, they may experience the strange feeling that they are in a shared reality or reconnecting even though in “real life” they haven’t spoken at all.\n\nThis phenomenon is interesting and potentially meaningful, and often means that your souls are communicating in the spirit world.\n\nAre they just saying hello or is there more to it?\n\nA lot of that depends on the content of the dream, the feeling you are left with after waking up and the symbols and content of the dream.\n\nThe universe wants you to reconnect\n\nSometimes dreaming of somebody you don’t talk to anymore means the universe wants you to reconnect, sometimes not.\n\nThe key signs to watch for are whether you have the same dream more than once and, if so, what the dream is telling you.\n\nWhat words, if any, are exchanged in the dream?\n\nWhat is the overriding emotion of the dream?\n\nDo you receive any strong prompting upon waking up such as “Call Allison?” or something like that?\n\nIf the answers center around a desire or need for reconnection or resolution of past wrongs then you should strive to make contact.\n\nIf making contact isn’t a possibility or if the dream’s emotions and message don’t point towards reconnecting, then hold off.\n\nMeanwhile, let’s dig a bit more into this…\n\nLet’s get deep…\n\nDreams of people from the past sometimes represent a sense of fondness and nostalgia for who we once were.\n\nIt’s not necessarily that you’re missing them or have unresolved business.\n\nSometimes it can simply be that you’re missing the way things were and the person you were in the past.\n\nYou may be missing the emotional states of well-being and connection you experienced with this person.\n\nOr you may be dreading the fights and problems you had with this person and be warned about not falling into those kinds of connections again.\n\nDreams of those we no longer speak with are sometimes warnings, sometimes nostalgia, and sometimes nostalgic.\n\nWhen we get on this deeper level, sometimes it is very about missing a past version of ourselves or wanting to reconnect to that older version of ourselves.\n\nMissing who you were when they were in your life\n\nWe are always changing and life is a process of change.\n\nDreaming of someone you’re not in touch with anymore can be a way of dreaming of yourself and how you used to be.\n\nThe person you were, the feelings you carried with you, the values you embodied, even your physical appearance at the time.\n\nThese are all aspects of your past self when you were close to this person, sort of like the setting of the film.\n\nThis type of message can be subtler and is quite easy to miss if you’re not paying attention and analyzing.\n\nBut if you detect that this dream is more about missing how you once were, start putting some thought and introspection into what’s changed about you since that time and what you valued most in yourself in those past days.\n\nDo you really miss them or is this dream about you?\n\nCatching key symbols in the background\n\nMany dreams have key symbols in the background, including dreams about somebody you don’t talk to anymore.\n\nUnderstanding the interpretations of such symbols can shine a light on the meaning with regard to the person you dreamed of as well as the meaning of the dream more broadly.\n\nFor example:\n\nWild animals can represent many different emotions and feelings, from the desire for inclusion to fear of being harmed. They often key us in to wanting to reconnect to our real nature and truth about ourselves.\n\nChasing dreams: these type of dreams represent a feeling of being under threat or life and other people, including expectations of other people, closing in on you.\n\nChanging clothes: dreams about changing clothes or trying to find the perfect look, wearing disguises, etc. are all about feeling insecure about how people see us in life and how we are valued or perceived.\n\nTests or exams usually represent taking a deeper look at ourselves or trying our best to pass a difficult or challenging time.\n\nFalling dreams: usually falling in dreams represents fear of losing control or being lost, as opposed to flying or soaring dreams which relate to liberation and personal freedom and power.\n\nBroken machines or malfunctioning cars, etc. usually represent fear about not being up to the task we’re being asked to do or feeling lost and confused in our life in some way.\n\nHair dreams are usually about sex, with lots of hair being sexual desire and vitality for men and cut short hair representing a loss or cramping of sexual expression.\n\nHouses in dreams generally have different meanings for each room, but the house as a whole is thought to represent your psyche or identity as a whole.\n\nKilling in dreams usually is a sign that you want to get rid of or eliminate some part of yourself or some burden from the past, and doesn’t represent an actual desire to commit murder.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nIf you have dreamed of somebody you don’t talk to anymore, it generally means there is something unresolved in your relationship with them or with yourself.\n\nYou are being called on to take a look at who you were during this time, at the nature of your connection with this person and to probe the meaning and look at the spiritual significance of it.\n\nLinking up with a gifted spiritual advisor is also something I really recommend.\n\nIt helped me out a lot in understanding my dream of Allison and what to do about it.\n\nWe’re now more in touch than we used to be and it feels good."
