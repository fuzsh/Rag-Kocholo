Spend time alone. Write in a journal. Robin Sharma\n\nTo go deeper, here are 3 steps for your journal:\n\nAs you know, one of the core principles of Fierce Kindness is creating a deep connection with yourself. So:\n\nConsider which of these quotes:\n\nMost UNSETTLES you &\n\nMost RESONATES with you?\n\nWrite out these 2 quotes in your journal and ponder these questions over a quiet cup of tea or coffee:\n\nWHY do you think you were drawn to them?\n\nWHAT do you think each quote is saying to YOU specifically?\n\nWhat are some IDEAS you’ve been having, of changes you could make in your life—however small?\n\nNow, for inspiration, put your 2 chosen quotes somewhere you’ll see them often. And then over the next month, make an effort to notice the quotes—and each time you do, ask:\n\nWhat is this quote teaching me today/now?\n\nFinally, will you take action? Answer these 3 questions:\n\nWhat is your dream for this life? What—if you allowed yourself to dream BIG—can you imagine for yourself?\n\nWhat could your first step? Or if you’ve already started, what bold ideas do you have that could move it forwards?\n\nAnd what action are you willing to COMMIT to, to bring your dream one step closer to reality?\n\nWrap-up\n\nIt is our dreams—and visions of what could be—that drives us to do great things, not only for ourselves but for others and our world.\n\nDo you have a dream?\n\nHow will you make a difference for yourself—and our world? And what are you willing to do to make it happen?\n\nLove Emma-Louise x\n\nIf you liked this article with quotes about following your dreams, you may also like:\n\n7 Deep Journaling Prompts to Connect to Your Unique Hopes & Dreams!
