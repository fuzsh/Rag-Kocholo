        "text": "Why did God allow you to have a dream about someone? Do these dreams mean God wants you to be with this person? Is this a sign this person is your future spouse?\n\nHere are 4 possible reasons God is allowing you to dream about someone.\n\nI also wanted to quickly let you know I just opened enrollment for AGW University at the reduced tuition cost. I only do this a few times a year. AGW University is where I offer the next level of my biblical relationship teachings. These courses are different than my articles and YouTube videos because I go into some really specific topics in much greater detail from a biblical perspective that is just not possible to do here or on the YouTube platform.\n\nSo if you are a Christian single person who wants to prepare with the Lord to meet the person he has for you, and if you are someone who has enjoyed this content but wants to go deeper with me, you can either click here to visit AGW University or just read to the end of this article where I will share some more information about this unique opportunity.\n\n1. God Could Be Allowing You to Dream About Someone Because He Is Sending You a Level 2 Sign and Probably Not a Level 1 Sign and Definitely Not a Level 3 Sign\n\nIf you’ve been following me for a while, you know I believe there are basically three main types of signs. To understand what I’m about to say in regards to dreams, we need to quickly review this information about signs. Otherwise it will be really easy to misunderstand what I am saying here. So stick with me. This information can be heady but it’s really important.\n\nThe first type of sign is what I refer to as “signs and wonders.” These types of signs are supernatural events that God causes to occur for a specific purpose. These are biblical. For example, when Daniel had a prophetic dream in Daniel 7 or Pharoh had a dream that Joseph interpreted in Genesis 41 or Nebuchadnezzar had a dream in Daniel 2, these would be example of “signs and wonders.” Do I believe God can still communicate to us in these ways? I do, but I also believe he rarely does communicate like this now because he has now given us his Spirit and his written word to guide us. When it comes to level 1 signs (i.e., signs and wonders), we are told not to seek after these things (Matthew 12:38-42). If God wants to do them, he will do them.\n\nThe second type of sign is what I’m always talking about in my articles and videos when I say something like, “3 Signs God wants you to do this,” or “5 Signs God wants you to do that.” I define these types of signs as “evidence for what God wants you to do.” I believe God is always communicating to us and guiding us. For example, when God communicates through his word by pointing out a specific command relevant to your question, this is a sign, meaning it is evidence for what God wants you to do. For example, when Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 10:11-14 to observe how a town receives them to help guide their decision on if they should stay or go, this was him telling them to look for evidence (i.e., a sign). If the town received their message, this was evidence God wanted them to stay. If the town rejected their message, this was evidence God wanted them to go. A level 2 sign is what we should always be looking for when we are trying to figure out what God wants us to do.\n\nThe third type of sign is what most people are looking for in the world. This is an unbiblical type of sign that I label as “horoscopes and superstitions.” This is when someone adds their own interpretation or meaning to a random event. So if you think God is telling you to date someone named Sarah because you saw a street sign named “Sarah Lane,” this would be you adding your own interpretation to something random. You also passed other street signs of people’s names you know, but those are not signs you should date those people. They are just street signs.\n\nI bring all this up because we can apply these principles to dreams as well. Could God send you a level 1 sign through a dream? Yes, but that rarely happens because God has given us his word and his Spirit lives in us. So we should not need such grand signs anymore if we are following the Spirit and trusting God’s word in faith.\n\nMost of the time people are using a level 3 type of sign when it comes to their dreams which is unbiblical and unwise. The fact is, most of our dreams don’t mean anything. Our brains are just working while we sleep and causing us to have odd stories and images run through our minds. If you need to add your own interpretation to a weird dream, it probably means you are doing too much and reading too much into this.\n\nFor the rest of this article, I’ll give you a few examples of some level 2 types of signs that God could be sending you through a dream about someone so you can gain some evidence about what he wants you to do or not do.\n\n(I’ve talked more about this topic in my article called How to Interpret Dreams and Prophecies About Relationships and Your Future Marriage.)\n\n2. God Could Be Allowing You to Dream About Someone to Help You Realize You Really Do Like This Person\n\nWhile I don’t believe it is wise to break a dream down and apply specific meanings to each little detail in the dream, I do think it is wise to realize your mind is connected to your heart.\n\nLet’s say you have a dream about someone you work with. In real life you two are just casual friends. Through talking recently, however, you come to find out this person is a Christian too and attends a church you’ve heard good things about. Now your interest has peaked a bit and you wonder if you two could be something more one day. That night, you then have a dream where you two are standing at the altar getting married. What does this mean?\n\nIt probably doesn’t mean God is telling you that you two will be married one day. You could be married one day, I just don’t think you should interpret that dream in that way. In my opinion, this dream probably just means that you like this person. Remember, your heart and mind are connected. Perhaps while you are sleeping your mind is just manifesting a feeling in your heart.\n\nBut this is actually really valuable information that God can use. One of the most confusing parts about the beginning of a relationship is trying to figure out if you actually like someone or not. This dream shouldn’t be used as evidence that this person likes you. Rather, it can be used as evidence that you actually do like this person, which is helpful to know about yourself so you can accept this fact and pray about what you should do next.\n\nAs a sidenote, though, if you already know in your heart you don’t like this person and know you would never want to date this person, then you don’t need to read into this dream. It would then just be a random story your mind was making up. Maybe it was just your mind playing on your heart’s desire to be married and your mind just inserted this person because you interacted with them that day. This could be evidence you want to be married and this person in the dream was inconsequential.\n\nThe truth is, a dream like that could tell you something or it could mean absolutely nothing. This is why we should not spend too much time thinking about dreams but we should spend more time thinking about God’s word; in the Bible, we know there is meaning and truth that God will guide us with.\n\nAs Psalm 119:169 says, “Let my cry come before you, O Lord; give me understanding according to your word!”\n\n3. God Could Be Allowing You to Dream About Someone to Help You See You Are Thinking About This Person Too Much Throughout the Day\n\nAnother piece of helpful evidence God could give you through a dream can be that you are thinking too much about someone and it has become unhealthy for you. There’s nothing wrong with thinking about someone, liking someone, or hoping you two date one day. But whatever is at the forefront of our minds is what we are currently worshiping.\n\nColossians 3:2 states, “Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.” This doesn’t mean you can’t ever think about things on this earth. It just means you should not “set your mind” on something other than God. Who is consuming your thoughts? God or a person?\n\nSometimes we just dream about whatever we thought about the most that day. For example, I’ve noticed that when I have a deadline or something I’m waiting to do that I really don’t want to forget to do, I have a reoccurring dream where I’m back at my high school but I can’t remember what class I’m supposed to be at that day. My anxiety about something I’m waiting to do in my real life gets expressed through this reoccurring dream of forgetting my schedule when I was a teenager. My wife has a similar reoccurring dream where she is stressing out about taking the test to become a RN again. She’s already passed that test but stress can cause her brain to have that dream.\n\nThis same thing can be happening with you and this relationship dream you keep having. Relationships are made by God. It’s not wrong to think about someone. But if you are thinking so much about someone you have all kinds of anxious feelings inside of you and then this is causing you to dream about this person, this could be evidence that God wants you to not think about this person so much.\n\n4. God Could Be Allowing You to Dream About Someone to Cause You to Pray More About the Possibility of a Relationship with Him or Her\n\nDreams are really confusing. Trying to find meaning in every dream is even more confusing. But one thing I’ve learned in life and through studying the Bible is that God is not the author of confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33) but he does sometimes use the confusion in our lives to draw us closer to him. Again, I’m not saying God will cause you to be confused. But being confused is a sign you should seek God’s wisdom and clarity more passionately in prayer.\n\nSo the confusion you have from this dream about someone could just be a sign that God wants you to pray more with him about this relationship. Through prayer you will gain peace about whether or not you should pursue something more with this person or if you should just move on (Philippians 4:6-7, James 1:5-8).\n\nAre you a Christian single person who feels led to pursue marriage one day when God tells you the time is right? If so, I created AGW University for you. I’m currently offering 3 main courses that are specifically designed to take you through all the important steps you need to take so you will be ready on the inside and outside for dating. These three main courses will give you the spiritual, biblical, and practical advice you need to meet, date, and marry the person God has for you (if he does indeed call you to marriage one day).\n\nI’ve also created two bonus courses around two topics that have repeatedly popped up during my email coaching conversations with my current AGW students. The first bonus course is all about how to use online dating in the most effective way possible. Online dating is not for everyone, but it is a great tool for some people. I’ve had students meet their future spouse through online dating and I have personal friends who have met their spouse this way too. But you need to use it the right way for it to be effective.\n\nThe second bonus course I’m offering is all about sanctifying your sexuality. There have been so many previous students who have needed healing from past relationship sins or help overcoming a current sexual sin pattern that I felt compelled to offer this course. It’s really important to get this part of your life in order if you want to thrive in dating and marriage one day.\n\nSo if you are interested in lifetime access to these 3 main courses and these 2 free bonus courses, along with three months of bonus email coaching with me, and access to the private Facebook group where you can interact with all the other AGW students, feel free to click here to learn more about AGW University before the deadline passes by.\n\nI’ll see you there!"
