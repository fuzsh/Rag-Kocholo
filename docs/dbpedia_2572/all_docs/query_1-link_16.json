Recurring dreams may be precisely the same every time or only recycle the same scenarios or fears. However, there are some plotlines or themes that are common in recurring dreams. These include:\n\nFalling\n\nFlying\n\nCar crashes\n\nSnakes\n\nSpiders\n\nLooking for a toilet\n\nBeing overwhelmed by house maintenance\n\nNot being able to speak\n\nLosing teeth\n\nBeing attacked\n\nPublic nakedness\n\nBeing pregnant\n\nReturning to school\n\nBeing unprepared for school or work\n\nBeing chased or trapped\n\nFinding new rooms in the home or a familiar building\n\nSome themes are more common than others. For example, over 53% of people experience recurring dreams about falling, while only 15.5% experience them about losing teeth. It is also not unusual to experience recurring dreams that have none of these themes or are based on personal experiences. Your recurring dreams may be vivid, or they may be difficult to remember.\n\nWhat Recurring Dreams Do Children Have?\n\nAlthough both adults and children experience recurring dreams, children may experience them more often than teenagers or adults. In one study, 35% of 11-year-olds reported having had a recurring dream in the past year, compared to 15% of 15-year-olds.\n\nChildren also have their own familiar plotlines, such as confronting characters from fairy tales, although themes like falling, being chased, and car accidents are also common. Children are less likely to have positive recurring dreams, though they have significantly more recurring dreams that inspire a neutral emotional response.\n\nWhat Do Recurring Dreams Mean?\n\nThe idea that dreams have hidden meanings in their content was a popular component of Freudian dream theory Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . But, there is little evidence to support the idea that dreams with the same content or themes have the same meaning for everyone. However, examining what your dreams mean to you personally can still be meaningful, particularly in a therapeutic context.\n\nExperiencing recurring dreams may point at underlying issues regardless of the dreamâ€™s content. Adults who experience frequent recurring dreams tend to have worse psychological health than those who do not, and many experts theorize that these dreams may be a way to work through unmet needs or process trauma Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.

Another theory is that recurring nightmares may have given our ancestors the chance to practice Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source detecting and avoiding danger.\n\nPeople who are under more psychological stress tend to have more negative recurring dreams, although a lack of stress is not related to having more pleasant recurring dreams.\n\nRecurring Dreams and Mental Health Disorders\n\nAlthough most people experience recurring dreams from time to time, they can also be symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People who experience these disorders have other significant symptoms as well.\n\nPeople with PTSD also tend to have different recurring dreams than people without this disorder. Their most common recurring nightmares involve reliving the trauma that caused their PTSD.\n\nRecurring Dreams and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common cause of difficult-to-treat adult epilepsy Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . Recurring nightmares are a common feature of TLE and may be caused by nocturnal seizures or the effect of REM sleep on the temporal lobe. People who have TLE tend to have recurring dreams that are intensely frightening, extremely vivid, and may produce strong emotions or feelings of dread. These dreams often begin soon after a personâ€™s first seizure and are less common in people undergoing successful treatment.\n\nCoping With or Stopping Recurring Dreams\n\nAlthough they may be a normal part of sleep for many people, recurring dreams that provoke negative emotions can be deeply upsetting and difficult to live with. If you are concerned about your recurring dreams, or if they make it difficult for you to sleep or cope with daily life, your doctor can help you decide on a treatment plan.\n\nThere are also lifestyle changes that may help you cope with or reduce your recurring dreams.
