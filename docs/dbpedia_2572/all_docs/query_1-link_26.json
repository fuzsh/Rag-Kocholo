        "text": "There's a lot of discussion behind the meaning of dreams, with the general belief that they reveal the depths of our subconscious, including our fears and desires. But what does it mean if you regularly dream about the same person?\n\nWhat is a recurring dream?\n\nJust as it sounds, it's a dream that keeps coming back. They can be both pleasant and nightmarish. Like many other dreams, they are often populated by people we know or spend a lot of time with.\n\nWhat does it mean if you have a recurring dream?\n\nAccording to a clinical psychologist, having recurring dreams about the same person shouldn't be taken too literally. Whether it's our partners, close friends or family, we create emotional bonds with people that give us security and safety.\n\nHaving recurring dreams is a common phenomenon, with two-thirds of us experiencing them. These dreams may not mean that you are obsessed with this individual but may symbolise your feelings and worries. Some of us may dream about the people we spend a lot of time with, while others may dream of those we miss — such as those who are no longer with us.\n\n\"The model of the mind is very true to the idea of a computer,\" clinical psychologist Dr John Mayer told Elite Daily. \"When we go to sleep, that little computer will keep churning. It doesn't just turn off and stop. We have a perception that we're blank when we sleep – but [the brain] keeps going.\"\n\nDreaming can help our brains sort through information while we sleep. Dr Mayer also said that dreaming about someone over and over again shouldn't be interpreted in a literal way. That person might be symbolising certain stress or anxiety we are going through.\n\nFor example, if you dream about the same colleague, you might not have an issue with that particular individual but a more general work situation to work through.\n\n\"The dreams are usually not the same each time, but the recurring theme is usually something in your head that is somehow unresolved. It just keeps repeating over and over again in that computer,\" he said. \"So if the data is the same in the machine, you need to replace it with other data, or resolve that conflict, or solve that problem.\"\n\nWhy do we dream about the same people?\n\nSome of the reasons we dream about the same people may be:\n\nWe see them a lot during the day (such as a family member or colleague)\n\nTheir bond is particularly strong with us, such as a parent\n\nYour dream may be a way of dealing with loss and grief, especially if someone close has passed away\n\nIf you have nightmares about someone, it may signify that you are trying to keep them safe (such as a child)\n\nDreaming of someone from your past may be a sign that you want them back in your life\n\nThe person in your dream could symbolise the qualities you want to cultivate you want in your own life, such as strength or confidence\n\nTime to start dreaming..."
