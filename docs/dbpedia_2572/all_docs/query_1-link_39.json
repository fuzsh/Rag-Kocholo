        "text": "Dreams can get pretty weird sometimes. When you wake up from one that was particularly bizarre or vivid, you might feel relieved it was only a dream, one you’ll never have to experience again.\n\nWell, that last part might not always be the case. Some dreams come back not just once, but again and again.\n\nIf you have recurring dreams, you might wonder what they mean and whether your brain is trying to tell you something.\n\nHaving the same upsetting dream regularly can even start to stress you out or make it tough to get a good night’s sleep.\n\nWhy do these dreams happen? Is it possible to get rid of them? Do they have any significant meaning?\n\nHere’s what we do (and don’t) know about them.\n\nExperts believe recurring dreams generally reflect important themes in your life, including:\n\nunmet needs\n\nareas of frustration\n\nissues from the past that you haven’t addressed\n\nYou’ve probably had some variant of the “forgetting a final exam or research paper” dream. While very real stress related to final exams and research papers may have triggered this dream initially, it can easily come up again later in life, long after graduation.\n\nSince this dream most likely relates to your desire to succeed and your worries about failing, you might have this dream anytime you face an event that provokes similar feelings. This could be an event like a job interview, a big date, or a research proposal.\n\nDaily frustrations\n\nSome theories about dreams suggest they help you process day-to-day experiences.\n\nWhen you face something that poses a threat or keeps you from achieving goals — anything from workplace insecurities to relationship troubles to difficulty making decisions — you might feel frustrated or stressed. That, in turn, can seep into your dreams.\n\nThis idea is backed by 2017 research linking negative recurring dreams to unmet psychological needs.\n\nA group of 200 adult students were asked to evaluate whether their psychological needs were met or unmet.\n\nThese needs included:\n\nautonomy, or the need to feel like you have at least some control over your life\n\ncompetence, or the need to have a meaningful impact on your life\n\nrelatedness, or the need to both care for and be cared for by others\n\nThen, they described the recurring dream they had most often. Researchers asked them to rate how positive or negative the dream was, using terms like “hopeful,” “exciting,” “sad,” or “frustrating.”\n\nThose who reported more unmet needs tended to report negative dream themes and describe their dreams with negative emotions.\n\nUnresolved issues\n\nUnpleasant or traumatic events from the past often remain in your memory. People often don’t realize, however, that distress associated with trauma can also linger in bodily and emotional responses. These traumatic events can include:\n\nabuse\n\nbullying\n\ndisasters\n\nfamily conflict\n\nIf you’ve experienced trauma or abuse but haven’t fully acknowledged or processed the experience, you might notice recurring dreams that reflect your emotions related to what happened.\n\nDreams of drowning, for example, might reflect an overwhelming sense of helplessness, while a dream of being trapped or running in slow motion might suggest you still feel unable to escape.\n\nRecurring dreams can also reflect more everyday internal conflicts.\n\nMaybe you’re struggling with an important decision or feel uncertain about a recent choice you made.\n\nUntil you make your choice and come to terms with it, you might experience recurring dreams of being lost, failing a test, or otherwise making a mistake.\n\nCurrent events\n\nHave you had any recent dreams about wearing masks or people without mouths? Maybe you keep dreaming about being stranded alone somewhere or of giant insects.\n\nStress related to current events can show up in your dreams.\n\nIf COVID-19 news and updates permeate your waking life, there’s a good chance you’ll experience some of this tension in your dreams, too.\n\nThese themes may show up clearly (masks and isolation) or more symbolically (bugs, which your brain might translate to virus), according to dream researcher Deirdre Barrett, PhD, in an interview with The Harvard Gazette.\n\nYou’re more likely to experience upsetting dreams when you feel anxious or distressed during the day.\n\nIf you feel more worried about the future than usual, that’s perfectly understandable. But you may not be able to ease that fear and tension when you sleep until you take steps to manage it during the day."
