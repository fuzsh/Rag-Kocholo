        "text": "This is about you trying for that thing. Labor for that thing. And, to pull yourself \"up\" out of everything in order to get what you want. Maybe you been fighting all your life, those unknown people in your dream are about walking into the unknown. What do you need to walk into? It's time to face that crisis. Can you think deep enough to understand that?\n\nThis dream is about being there to serve you. The unknown faces is not just about you but those that need to serve you. You shall without fail win that fight. I know you are tired, I know you feel like your too old, but this is about you overcoming people so you can get what you want. Today, you need to celebrate your survival in this world. You need to celebrate that you are here right now. And, these unknown people that have occurred in that dreamworld is about how you can fight for what you need.\n\nUnknown people in dreams are like a flashlight into our spiritual world. Strangers in dreams could be those that we have met before, even energies from people that we have seen in our life or past life.\n\nFreud or Jung believe in conscious and that resistance to let go of relationships to start new ones with others. These psychologists believe we dream of unknown people because it is our beliefs, experiences, and fantasies. In the spiritual realm, the unknown people or strangers are connected to them serving you. Our brain is messy. Things are messy. Life is messy.\n\nWhat does the dream of unknown people mean?\n\nMaybe you been a little under the weather, but this is a great omen if you see unknown people. If you are laughing and talking to people you do not know in the dream it can indicate that you are The dream of unknown people you are in the middle of your journey in life. The dream could be connected to a career, school or being a parent, travel, business, new goals, a business opportunity, or even a new relationship. If you dream of strangers then this can signify a range of the multitude of life journeys. In our dream world, we are in darkness, and the dream can indicate that we need to open the gates of our life. When we see people and interact with them in the dream it could represent our dream people. A dream of this nature is about the following:\n\n1) Who we currently are?\n\n3) how did we get here in life?\n\n4) where are we going in life?\n\n5) what is reality?\n\nEnergy in dreams can come in many forms, astral and etheric bodies, transformations, and intelligent flow. The mysterious people in your dream could be aspects of your personality, it is about our energy and how this form leads to great exploration. Therefore, I believe this dream is about your potential healing and recognizing the characteristics of the people in the dream. If you see a group of unknown friends in a dream this describes all the positive energy around you.\n\nWho are dream people?\n\nIf you feel like you are floating around trying to understand everything, speaking to people you donâ€™t know this is about your journey. When we look at the dream of people - we need to understand the emotional impact of the dream event, what meaning does that person's personality attach to it? Think about the emotional impact of these people. What people did the personality of these people attach to you? Sometimes we can often pick up the emotions of others, and the people. For example, some family members may have a dream of the same unknown person (that they don't know in real life).\n\nSince we all meet the fates at a crossroads, we need to see what our fate requires. We may find ourselves in screams of moral fear, some dreams provide an unknown feeling of being somewhere or seeing someone we know but don't in waking life.\n\nDreaming about someone you never met\n\nIt's not uncommon to dream about someone you've never met before. Dreams are often symbolic, and the person in your dream may represent something else entirely. If you're wondering what your dream could mean, consider these possible interpretations:\n\nThe person in your dream could be a representation of your subconscious mind. Perhaps there's something on your mind that you're not aware of or something you're repressing. The person in your dream could be a stand-in for someone else in your life. Dreams often use symbolism to represent people or things in our waking lives. The person in your dream could be symbolic of an aspect of yourself that you're not comfortable with. It is also possible that the person is a symbol of something you desire. You may also be dreaming of a spiritual messenger. The subconscious mind often communicates with us through dreams. There's a possibility that the person in your dream is trying to communicate with you. Of course, there's no way to know for sure that you did not dream of spiritual people or those from a past life.\n\nDreaming about a group of people you don't know\n\nIf you dream about a group of people you don't know, it could be symbolic of something going on in your life. Dreams often use symbolism to represent different aspects of our lives. The people in your dream could represent different parts of yourself or different people in your life. Alternatively, the group could be symbolic of a situation or challenge you're facing.\n\nIf you dream about a group of people you don't know, try to think about what the dream might be trying to tell you. Consider what the different people in the group represent, and what the overall group dynamic might be symbolic of. Pay attention to your feelings in the dream, as they can provide clues about what the dream means.\n\nStill, stumped about what your dream could mean? Try keeping a dream journal. Write down your dreams as soon as you wake up, and see if any patterns emerge over time. You may find that your dreaming mind is trying to tell you something important!\n\nDreaming about someone you met online\n\nWe meet people online and we may have never met them. Maybe you have, maybe you have not in the waking world. To dream of meeting someone online could be symbolic of your feelings or thoughts about someone you met online if you dream about them. Many aspects of our lives are represented by symbols in dreams. There is a possibility that the person in your dream represents something else entirely, such as an aspect of yourself that you are uncomfortable with. It is also possible that the person represents something you wish for.\n\nThe meaning of your dream cannot be known for certain, of course. If you are having a dream about someone, try to think about what the person represents to you, and what your feelings toward them are. Consider what the dream might be telling you about yourself or your relationship with the person. In your dream, pay attention to your feelings.\n\nDreaming about being friends with people you don't know\n\nIf you dream about being friends you don't know, it could be symbolic of something going on in your life. Dreams often use symbolism to represent different aspects of our lives. The friends in your dream could represent different parts of yourself or different people in your life. The friend could be symbolic of a situation or challenge that you are about to approach. Remember as well the way these people were presented to you, if they were friendly then this is a part of you.\n\nDreaming of people staying at your house you don't know\n\nIf you dream of people staying at your house it could be symbolic of a new property or something with friends going on in their life. Dreams often use symbolism to represent different aspects of our way of life - and others. The people in your dream could represent different parts of yourself or different phrases in life.\n\nDreaming of a party with strangers\n\nA party is celebratory in dreams, it is about how we make sure we are happy with the different aspects of our lives. Seeing a party with strangers attending is about a wish for more of a fulfilled social life. It is about being wonderful and that you are going to do all you can to make things in life a success.\n\nIs the dream of unknown people good or bad?\n\nI believe this is a good dream. Dreaming of unknown people is the omen of changes in your life, and most of the time it refers to good changes unless the unknown person in your dream is ugly or deformed. To feel in your dream that you are unknown to other people, some older dream meanings from the 1930s indicate strange events in your life may generate bad luck for you, which can manifest through an illness ahead.\n\nIf in your dream you meet unknown people, this refers to the fact that you are probably feeling lonely and you need someone in your life, someone that would keep you company and would make you happy. The dream about unknown people indicates that something or someone is missing in your life, or that you are experiencing insecurities and instabilities at the moment.\n\nWhat does it mean to dream of strange people?\n\nAre you currently in contact with any of the people in terms of character? Why are they strange? Are you familiar with them? If not, who are the characters that remind you of if? Try again to think of a few words that describe each character. For example, imagine a man wearing a police uniform. Maybe think about the words that describe the character of the person in the dream, which are strict, caring, efficient, and bossy. Have you ever met someone like this? Or is the \"police\" figure an aspect of you? Strange people in dreams can indicate a part of yourself or aspects of things that you are trying to hide.\n\nIn your dream, you may have\n\nYou meet with unknown people.\n\nUnknown people scare you.\n\nAn unknown person.\n\nAn experience with unknown people.\n\nPositive changes are afoot if\n\nYour experience was somehow positive.\n\nThe unknown people did not scare you.\n\nYou enjoyed the company of some unknown people.\n\nFeelings that you may have encountered during a dream of unknown people\n\nScared. Upset. Worried. Anxious. Surprised. Discontent. Insecure. Do not know what to do. Do not want to do anything about it. Concerned. Enjoying. Having fun."
