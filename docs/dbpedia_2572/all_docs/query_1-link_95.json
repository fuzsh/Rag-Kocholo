        "text": "Vivid dreams are more likely than other dreams to stick in your memory. They're also more likely to happen in the morning. Some people find them distressing.\n\nExperts think morning dreams are easier to remember because they happen during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, which usually occurs soon before you wake up.\n\nDuring REM sleep, your brain processes your emotions and experiences and organizes them into long-term memories. This may be why these turbulent dreams occur.\n\nWhile vivid dreams are normal, they shouldn't affect how you feel during the day. This article looks at why vivid dreams occur and how poor-quality sleep can make you have more of them.\n\nWhat Are Vivid Dreams?\n\nYou are most likely to have vivid dreams during REM sleep. While you can dream at any time at night, REM sleep is when certain structures in your brain become more active.\n\nDuring REM sleep, the thalamus, a brain region that deals with sensory information, lights up. It sends images and thoughts collected during the day to the cerebral cortex for processing.\n\nDreams happen during this time. Some dreams can be so vivid you wonder if they really happened. Other dreams seem random or just slip from your memory.\n\nSome people think symbols in your dreams can provide insight into your mental health, but there is no evidence to support this. Scientists do, however, recognize that emotions can express themselves in dreams.\n\nSleep Stages and Dreaming\n\nWhen you're asleep, your brain goes through four to six cycles called sleep stages. In each cycle, there are periods of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. These are followed by short intervals of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.\n\nFragmented dreams that consist of simple ideas and images can happen during NREM sleep, but the most elaborate dreams occur during REM.\n\nEach of the sleep cycles lasts about 90 minutes. As morning gets closer, the NREM periods become shorter and the REM periods become longer.\n\nMorning REM Sleep and Dream Recall\n\nClose to morning, you spend more time in REM sleep and you have more dreams. You're most likely to remember vivid dreams when REM sleep is interrupted.\n\nYour sleep drive, or desire to sleep, also lessens the longer you sleep. This makes you more likely to become restless and wake up toward morning. That increases the chance you'll wake during an REM period.\n\nSleep apnea is also more likely during REM sleep. This may be because your muscles relax to stop you from acting out your dreams.\n\nWhen the muscles in your airway relax, it can interrupt breathing and wake you up. When this happens, you're more likely to remember what you were dreaming about.\n\nWhat Causes Vivid Dreams?\n\nMany things can cause you to have vivid dreams, including medications, drug use, certain physical conditions, and your mental health.\n\nMedications\n\nVarious classes of medication can cause vivid dreams and nightmares in some people.\n\nCertain antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most likely to do this. One such drug is Prozac (fluoxetine), which also makes you more likely to recall your dreams.\n\nBeta-blockers have been linked to vivid dreams, as well. These medications are commonly used to treat cardiovascular disease. Two beta-blockers closely associated with vivid dreams and sleep disturbances are:\n\nLopressor (metoprolol)\n\nToprol XL (metoprolol succinate)\n\nOther drugs linked to vivid dreams in some people include:\n\nMelatonin\n\nStatins (cholesterol-lowering medications)\n\nWellbutrin (bupropion)\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\nThis side effect isn't typically a problem. If your vivid dreams have a negative impact on you, though, talk to your healthcare provider about it. It might be worth switching to a different medication.\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nWhen you wake up often, you're more likely to recall having vivid dreams. Sleep disorders may cause you to wake up several times overnight.\n\nSleep disorders heighten your body's response to stress and increase your risk of serious health conditions, such as:\n\nCardiovascular disease\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nSleep disorders that may cause you to wake often include:\n\nInsomnia\n\nSleep apnea\n\nRestless legs syndrome\n\nNarcolepsy\n\nCircadian rhythm disorders\n\nNocturnal polyuria\n\nExperts think waking up frequently during the night is harmful to the body and brain. In fact, it may even be just as harmful as not getting any sleep at all.\n\nPregnancy\n\nPeople in the third trimester of pregnancy may have frequent vivid dreams and nightmares.\n\nOne study compared 57 pregnant females in the third trimester to 59 non-pregnant females. There was no difference in how often subjects in each group could recall dreams.\n\nHowever, 21% of the pregnant subjects reported bad dreams compared to 7% of those who weren't pregnant. The pregnant subjects also reported poorer sleep quality.\n\nResearchers think the hormonal and physical changes that happen during pregnancy may make you more prone to:\n\nInsomnia\n\nInterrupted sleep\n\nRecalling bad dreams\n\nSubstance Abuse\n\nNightmares are common in people who have a substance abuse disorder. Severe psychological stress is more common, as well.\n\nThis is often due to childhood abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Experts think this explains why people with substance abuse disorders have frequent nightmares.\n\nPeople who are in withdrawal or who have become sober may dream about using the substance again.\n\nMental Health Conditions\n\nNightmares are common in several mental health conditions, including:\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\nComplex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD)\n\nDepression\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\n\nBipolar disorder\n\nSchizophrenia\n\nDissociative identity disorder\n\nPeople with these conditions may have nightmares regularly or in clusters.\n\nIn people with bipolar disorder, nightmares can signal that a manic or depressive episode is about to begin. Some people report a cluster of nightmares one or more years before the onset of bipolar disorder.\n\nPeople with PTSD or C-PTSD may relive traumatic events in their dreams. These are known as intrusive dreams. They can often result in insomnia, especially if you develop a fear of falling asleep.\n\nPhysical Illness\n\nThe relationship between sleep and immunity is well known. While you sleep, your immune system works to repair tissues and combat illness. You need consistent, quality sleep to stay healthy.\n\nSeveral studies show that people with certain medical conditions are more likely to have nightmares and vivid dreams.\n\nIn one, researchers looked at 1,233 people with cardiovascular (CV) disease. They found that 19% had depression, 17% had anxiety, and 15% recalled at least one nightmare per month.\n\nPeople with cancer are more prone to nightmares and insomnia as a result of the distress their illness causes.\n\nConsequences\n\nVivid dreams cause consequences when they interfere with your sleep. When this happens, you may have:\n\nAn inability to focus on tasks\n\nSlowed thinking\n\nSlowed reaction time\n\nDifficulty remembering things\n\nPoor judgment\n\nLethargy\n\nMood changes, like stress and irritability\n\nPoor sleep can also raise the risk of metabolic and hormonal conditions, including weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe underlying cause of your vivid dreams may also cause symptoms. Getting treatment for sleep apnea, a mood disorder, or other problems linked to your vivid dreams can help you feel better overall.\n\nHow to Stop Having Vivid Dreams\n\nIf you want to stop having vivid dreams, you have a few options. Start by adjusting your bedtime habits and schedule. You can try:\n\nGoing to sleep at the same time each night\n\nMaking sure you get at least seven hours of sleep\n\nTurning off screens once you get in bed\n\nEating dinner earlier in the evening and avoiding late-night snacks\n\nCutting out caffeine at least four to six hours before bedtime\n\nLimiting daytime naps to only when absolutely necessary\n\nExercising regularly during the day\n\nGetting blackout curtains to keep your room darker for longer\n\nIf you've tried these things and your dreams are still affecting you, it's time to look into other possible causes. One the cause is found, you're more likely to stop having disruptive dreams.\n\nSummary\n\nSleep quality affects your physical and mental health. If you aren't sleeping well or if your sleep is often interrupted, you may be more likely to have vivid dreams that you remember when you wake up.\n\nPeople who are pregnant or have a physical illness, anxiety, or a mood disorder like depression may also be more prone to recalling vivid dreams. If your dreams are affecting your quality of life, reach out to your healthcare provider or mental health therapist.\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nDwelling on your dreams can distract you from your day and cause distress. You may find it helpful to keep a dream journal. Use it to track how your waking emotions express themselves in your dreams.\n\nJust keep in mind that there is no scientific evidence that the symbols in your dreams have any profound meaning. Rather than focusing on the symbolism, try to hone in on what seems to contribute to your vivid dreams."
