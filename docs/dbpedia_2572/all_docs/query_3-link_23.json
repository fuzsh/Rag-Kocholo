        "text": "Imagery definition\n\nFirst, let’s define imagery\n\nAlthough there are several types of imagery, they all generally serve a similar function. To better understand the function of imagery in poetry and literature and how it can be achieved through various other literary devices, let’s take a look at the imagery definition.\n\nIMAGERY DEFINITION\n\nWhat is imagery?\n\nImagery is a literary device used in poetry, novels, and other writing that uses vivid description that appeals to a readers’ senses to create an image or idea in their head. Through language, imagery does not only paint a picture, but aims to portray the sensational and emotional experience within text.\n\nImagery can improve a reader’s experience of the text by immersing them more deeply by appealing to their senses. Imagery in writing can aim at a reader’s sense of taste, smell, touch, hearing, or sight through vivid descriptions. Imagery can be created using other literary devices like similes, metaphors, or onomatopoeia.\n\nWhat is imagery used for?\n\nEstablishing a world or setting\n\nCreating empathy for a character’s experience\n\nImmersing a character into a situation\n\nThere are seven different types of imagery that writer’s use. All are in one way or another dependent on the reader’s senses. Let’s take a look at the types of imagery that are most commonly used in literature.\n\nWhat is imagery in poetry\n\n1. Visual Imagery\n\nVisual imagery is most likely what people think of when they hear the term imagery. It uses qualities of how something looks visually to best create an image in the reader’s head. These visual qualities can be shapes, color, light, shadow, or even patterns.\n\nIt is one of the most common types of imagery as it allows readers to better describe the world and characters of a novel or poem. Visual imagery is often used in screenplays when first introducing characters. Take a look at how Quentin Tarantino uses this type of imagery to introduce characters and places in the Pulp Fiction screenplay.\n\nPulp Fiction screenplay • Imagery examples\n\nVisual imagery is often achieved through the use of other literary devices like metaphors and similes. To say a woman looks like Helen of Troy is both imagery, a simile, and an allusion.\n\nIt can be frequently found in screenplays when a character is first introduced.\n\nWhat’s imagery used for?\n\n2. Auditory Imagery\n\nOur next type of imagery is auditory imagery. This type of imagery appeals to a reader’s sense of hearing. Creating an auditory experience through text can be difficult. But it can also be necessary for a story or plot. For example, the sound of war can be necessary to immerse the reader into a war novel. This may be used to describe gunfire, explosions, screams, and helicopters.\n\nLet’s take a look at William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, auditory imagery is used for a physical action that affects the actions of the characters.\n\nMacbeth - Imagery examples\n\nAuditory Imagery\n\nPORTER:\n\n“Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of\n\nhell-gate, he should have old turning the key. Knock\n\nKnock, knock, knock, knock! Who’s there, i’ the name of\n\nBelzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on th’\n\nexpectation of plenty. Come in time! Have napkins\n\nenow about you; here you’ll sweat for’t. Knock\n\nKnock, knock! Who’s there, in th’ other devil’s name?”\n\nAs you can see from this example, writers will also enlist the use of onomatopoeia to create the actual sound of an action or effect through text. This can make reading a story more experiential.\n\nWhat does imagery mean?\n\n3. Gustatory Imagery\n\nGustatory imagery is a type of imagery that aims at a reader’s sense of taste. This would most commonly be used to describe food as a character eats it. A great example of this can be found in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. As the Queen creates Turkish Delight for Edmund, C.S. Lewis uses gustatory imagery to describe its taste.\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Imagery examples\n\nGustatory Imagery\n\n“The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.”\n\nDescribing food as sweet, salty, or even spicy can immerse a reader further into a character’s simple action of eating. Gustatory imagery can be incredibly effective when describing unpleasant tastes as well.\n\nWhat’s imagery used for?\n\n4. Olfactory Imagery\n\nOlfactory imagery is used when writers’ want to appeal to a reader’s sense of smell. Olfactory imagery is a great way to better describe both what a character is experiencing as well as the world of the novel, poem, or other writing.\n\nThe smell of fresh rain, smoke from a fire, or gasoline can be described through olfactory imagery. A great example of this can be found in the novel\n\nThe Dead Path by Stephen M. Irwin. Note the comparisons Irwin used to create the olfactory imagery and paint a picture of the smell.\n\nThe Death Path - What is imagery in literature?\n\nOlfactory Imagery\n\n“But a smell shivered him awake.\n\nIt was a scent as old as the world. It was a hundred aromas of a thousand places. It was the tang of pine needles. It was the musk of sex. It was the muscular rot of mushrooms. It was the spice of oak. Meaty and redolent of soil and bark and herb. It was bats and husks and burrows and moss. It was solid and alive - so alive! And it was close.”\n\nOlfactory imagery can also be used in a screenplay as a plot point and to suggest to actor’s what they are smelling and how they are reacting.\n\nWhat does imagery mean?\n\n5. Tactile Imagery\n\nTo create the sensory experience of touch through text, writers utilize tactile imagery. This type of imagery can be used to describe how something feels such as texture, temperature, wetness, dryness, etc.\n\nIn Albert Camus’ novel The Stranger, Camus uses this type of imagery to describe the heat of the sun pressing down on a man at the beach.\n\nThe Stranger - What is imagery in literature?\n\nTactile Imagery\n\n“Seeing the rows of cypress trees leading up to the hills next to the sky, and the houses standing out here and there against that red and green earth, I was able to understand Maman better. Evenings in that part of the country must have been a kind of sad relief. But today, with the sun bearing down, making the whole landscape shimmer with heat, it was inhuman and oppressive.”\n\nAs you can see from this example, this can be tremendously effective when characters are undergoing some type of turmoil. Tactile imagery appeals to a reader’s sense of touch and allows them to better empathize with a character.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nRead More: Ultimate guide to Literary Devices →\n\nRead More: What is a Motif?

Kinesthetic Imagery\n\nKinesthetic imagery is used to describe the sensory experience of motion. Speed, slowness, falling, or even fighting can be written with kinesthetic imagery.\n\nIn the world of screenwriting, kinesthetic imagery is perhaps most important in the genre of action films. How else can you write an epic fight scene other than by using kinesthetic imagery to paint the picture?\n\nIn our breakdown of one of the many epic fight scenes in John Wick, we take a look at how kinesthetic imagery can tell the story of action on the page. Using words like “slam” and “snap” create the imagery of the fight scene.\n\nWhat is Imagery in Fight scenes? • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nUP NEXT\n\nExplore more literary devices\n\nImagery is just one of many literary devices and types of figurative language, including metaphor, juxtaposition, and symbolism.
