Forgive me. „ ~ Jennifer begging God to forgive her for what she's going to do to her rapists.\n\nJennifer Hills is the main protagonist villain of the 1978 rape-and-revenge film I Spit On Your Grave, and the deuteragonist of its 2019 sequel, I Spit On Your Grave: Deja Vu.\n\nShe was a famous author who was raped by Johhny Stillman and his friends. Fueled by anger and trauma, she vows revenge, taking out her rapists one by one. As such, she gruesomely killed Johnny by cutting off his penis causing to bleed to death, hung Matthew with the nose, axed Andy in a lake, and finally disemboweled Stanley with a boat motor.\n\nYears later, she had a daughter and named her Christy Hills, as the result of the impregnation from Johnny when raping her. One of the rapists' relatives, especially Becky Stillman, vows revenge for the deaths of her family members. In the end, Becky ultimately killed Jennifer by decapitating her, and thus finally avenging the rapists.\n\nHowever, Jennifer's legacy lived on through Christy, who managed to take down the remaining members of the rapists' families.\n\nShe was portrayed by Camille Keaton.\n\nBiography[]\n\nI Spit On Your Grave (1978)[]\n\nIn 1978, Jennifer Hills was a girl who lived in Manhattan and began to rent an isolated cottage in Kent, Connecticut near the Houstanic in the Litchfield County to write. She meets a gas station owner named Johnny Stillman, two unemployed men named Andy Chirensky and Stanley Woods, and a developmentally disabled delivery boy named Matthew Duncan. Matthew delivers food to Jennifer and when he goes back, he tells the others about her. Later that night, Stanley and Andy snoop around the cottage and the next day, they attack her so that Matthew can lose his virginity, but he refused to rape her so they ripped her bathing suit off and rape her first. She tries to fight back but it wasn't enough. She goes back to the cottage but they attack and rape her again, but this time, Matthew rapes. Before leaving, they destroy her manuscript. She goes to church and asks God to forgive her for what she's gonna do to the 'men' that raped her, left her for dead, and destroyed her manuscript. She calls Matthew for food delivery to the cottage and Matthew scared that Jennifer will do something to him, brings a knife. Matthew is then hung wiith a noose and his body is put in the lake and takes his knife. He is then reported missing. She then goes after Johnny. She holds him at gun point and forces him to take his clothes off and they go to a bathroom and begin to have sex and uses Matthew's knife to cut off Johnny's penis and dies of bloodloss. Jennifer then puts his clothes in a fire of the fireplace. Johnny then is also repported missing. Andy and Stanley are then ambushed by Jennifer and kills Andy by axing him and Stanley by disemboweling him with a boat motor after telling the latter, \"Suck it, bitch!\" The film then ends Jennifer riding away in the boat, happy with her revenge.\n\nSavage Vengeance[]\n\nFive years later, Jennifer, having been acquitted of all charges, is exposed by her professor when she attends law school. She goes on a vacation with college friend Sam to get away with some time off. Tragically, she and Sam and targeted by two new felons, Dwayne Chesney and Tommy. Chesney raped and Tommy slashed a woman Tommy was rejected by at a bar, and when repeating the same harassment with Sam, the duo target the two women next. They reach the cabin, and when Sam walks off out of disgust, she finds Dwayne's cottage, where Dwayne rapes her and Tommy stabs her to death. Jennifer tries to find Sam at the gas station, and the two attackers take her to the cottage to find Sam's corpse. Catching Jennifer when she escapes, Dwayne rapes her too, Tommy slashing her chest and leaving her to die. Jennifer survives, hitchhiking back to the nearest town she can by weapons from. Dwayne finds out she's alive and asking around, then is blitzed when walking in the woods by Jennifer. Jennifer halves Dwayne's head with a chainsaw before heading off after Tommy, the killer in the process of speaking to the corpses of both dead women. Running Tommy out of the cottage, Jennifer shoots Tommy's crotch with a shotgun before leaving, Tommy bleeding out in excruciation.\n\nI Spit On Your Grave: Deja Vu[]\n\nForty years later, Jenniffer Hills has a daughter who is a famous supermodel, Christy Hills, and becomes a best-selling author, writing a book about how she got revenge on her rapists, which becomes very popular. She and her daughter were then kidnapped by the families of her victims. They consisted of a woman named Becky Stillman, who is Johnny's wife, an old married couple named Henry and Millie Stillman, who are Johnny's parents, a man named Herman Duncan, who is Matthew's father, an old woman named \"Beady Eyes\" Duncan, who is Matthew's grandmother, a man named Kevin Woods, who is Stanley's brother, and another man named Scotty Chirensky, who is Andy's cousin.\n\nAfter a long chase, Becky finally had Jennifer cornered in a church, where she slit her throat and decapitated her. They then put her headless corpse in an open grave and spat on it (a reference to the franchise's name). Christy found out and vowed to get revenge. At the end, after she succeeds, Christy brings the body back to New York to give her a real burial like she promised. It is then revealed that Johnny is the one who impregnated Jennifer with Christy forty years ago.\n\nVictims[]\n\nMatthew Duncan - Hung\n\nJohnny Stillman - Penis cut off, blood loss\n\nAndy Chirensky - Axed in back\n\nStanley Woods - Disemboweled with boat motor\n\nNavigation[]"
