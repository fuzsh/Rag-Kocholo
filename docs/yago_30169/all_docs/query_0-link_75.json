        "text": "A trailer has gone online for Growing Up with I Spit On Your Grave, a new documentary on Meir Zarchi’s controversial 1978 revenge-thriller Day of the Woman, re-released as I Spit On Your Grave in 1980. The film is directed by Meir Zarchi’s son Terry Zarchi and includes interviews with Meir and Camille Keaton.\n\nI Spit On Your Grave starred Keaton as Jill, a young novelist out to maim and murder the men who gang-raped her repeatedly while she vacationed alone in the woods for inspiration. The film was pulled from theaters upon its release and now rotting critic Roger Ebert dismissed it as a “vile bag of garbage.”\n\nDespite all the hate, the gory flick remains a cult favorite among aficionados of non-consensual sodomy and group sex. It was successfully remade in 2010 by Steven R. Monroe with Sarah Butler in the role of Jill and Meir Zarchi producing. There is also talk of a new sequel from Meir, picking up decades after the original.\n\nPeep it:"
