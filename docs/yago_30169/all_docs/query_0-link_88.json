        "text": "Meir Zarchi is set to produce I Spit On Your Grave: Deja Vu, a sequel to his controversial 1978 revenge-thriller Day of the Woman—re-released as I Spit On Your Grave in 1980. Deja Vu picks up decades after protagonist Jennifer Hills has been acquitted for the brutal slaughter of the four men who gang-raped her.\n\nJennifer, now a bestselling non-fiction author, becomes the target of the surviving members of her “victims” families, who feel justice is owed. I Spit On Your Grave star Camille Keaton, now 67, will reportedly reprise her role as Jennifer."
