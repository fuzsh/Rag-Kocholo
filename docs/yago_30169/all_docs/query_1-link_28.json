        "text": "I Spit on Your Grave did not exactly take the world of cinema by storm when it was released, first opening in a handful of drive-ins in America and then in grindhouse cinemas in 1980, two years after it was completed. There is good reason to believe that the film would have never reached a wider audience were it not for the critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who waged a war against what they perceived to be a totally despicable film and, according to Ebert, the worst he had ever seen.\n\n“Ebert sure didn’t like it, I heard him talk about it and it really hurt my feelings,” says Camille Keaton, the star of the film. “But [writer/director] Meir [Zarchi] told me not to worry about it: ‘Camille, this is the best publicity that we could ever get!’ And he was right. That made everybody want to go see it.”\n\nFull interview on Little White Lies\n\n[…] The short films you made with Kourtrajmé were posted online. Was this a choice, or out of necessity?\n\nA kind of cinema had to emerge somewhere, because we’re not on producers’ radars or financed by any organisations. There comes a point where we have to do it all ourselves. Kourtrajmé was born because we couldn’t recognise ourselves in French cinema. So we decided to make our own films, with our own stories, our own actors.\n\nIt just so happened that, when we started making films, it was the very beginning of the digital age. Digital cameras had just appeared and for the first time, people had access to the internet at home. We realised that the internet was a great space to broadcast our films. Dailymotion and YouTube didn’t exist yet. We had a Kourtrajmé website where we would post our videos, and they would be very successful.\n\nI’ve always held on to this concept where I would make my films independently. Even my documentaries, they were always censored by TV channels, they didn’t want them as they were, so I put them online for free. I never made money with my films, and I always worked that way.\n\nFull interview in Sight & Sound\n\n[…] Walkabout begins with a scene of unspeakable horror, then proceeds to excavate with heartbreaking beauty and candour its roots in man’s cruelty and greed. All this with a deceptively simple set-up, following 2 children abandoned in the Australian outback and looking for their way home to ‘civilisation’.\n\nOne of these 2 unnamed children – they are simply referred to as ‘girl’ and ‘white boy’ in the film’s credits – was played by Roeg’s own son, Luc, then aged only 7. Now an established film producer in his own right, Luc explains that this close relationship between actor and director was made even more direct by the fact that Roeg was also cinematographer on the film: “Having Nic photographing the film meant that there was nobody in between him directing the performance and the camera; it all just led to a very natural feeling around making the film.”\n\nFull interview on the BFI website\n\n[…] When you have an idea for a film, is it always something you completely understand, or is it more of a subconscious process?\n\nI’ve been with this project for eight or nine years, if you include the short film. It’s got to be something that interests you enough to maintain that passion over time. So if it’s something that I don’t completely understand, I want to excavate it. With my work, it is almost like I’m going in blind and just letting things happen. I always envy other writers or directors who seem to have such a clear idea of what they’re doing, because it seems somewhat more straightforward. I sort of torture myself over this. It’s also fun because images come to me and I don’t necessarily know how logically they’re going to fit into the story. I try and feel free to trust that the images will convey something around the subject that is interesting, or that we might discover later.\n\nFull interview on Little White Lies\n\nThis interview from 2016 first appeared on the Picturehouse website, on the occasion of the restoration of Abel Ferrara’s 1979 film The Driller Killer. Because the original link is now broken, I’m re-uploading the interview to my website.\n\nElena Lazic (EL): First, I wanted to talk about how the film came into being. The Driller Killer wasn’t your first feature film: you’d made a porn film before, I think because you were short of money. How did you then go to make The Driller Killer?\n\nAbel Ferrara (AF): I started making films when I was 16 years old. You know, at a certain point, you have to let go of school to go out in the world and try to make a living. There were two kinds of exploitation films back then, you dig? There was pornography and violence. These were your two options. We were gonna make films no matter what, whatever the deal was we just went for it. The first case was a pornographic film — we might have convinced ourselves it wasn’t one, but it was. We made one of those and that was enough of that. And the only other opportunity — because we were coming from totally outside, you know, we weren’t filmmakers, we didn’t know anybody, we weren’t even smart enough to figure out a way to get into the industry, we didn’t have enough to go to film school. We were just street filmmakers, street guys. Those were very commercial markets because there weren’t videotapes: if you wanted to see a film, you had to go to the theatre and watch. Pornography, even today, is a major industry. But it’s an industry where you just watch the films at home. Back then, it wasn’t like that, you had to go to the movie theatre. And in those theatres there were all kinds of people, it wasn’t just for one type of person. There was a whole audience for films like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, or Halloween, or that kind of film. And at that time, Hollywood — the conventional film industry — did not make those films. Once they realised the commerciality of that, they started making those movies like Friday the 13th. It became a very organised control of the marketplace. First by creating a censorship system, which basically eliminated our ability to sell our films in that market. Because they’d make a bunch of films like Friday the 13th and that would be R rated; we would make the same film it would be X rated. It isn’t so much the film itself, it’s the control of the marketplace.\n\nContinue reading “Abel Ferrara on The Driller Killer“ →\n\n[…] How do you write the process of falling in love without it appearing too sudden or too slow?\n\nWriting this film took me a lot of time. Not so much in the actual writing of it, but in the conception of it. The dream of it. It’s a film I’d long dreamed about, because I had two desires which might have initially appeared contradictory. The first was to communicate, step by step, the process of falling in love – the visual style of delay and frustration, patience, reciprocity, and doubt. There was this desire to show the birth of longing, of an inner turmoil.\n\nAnd there was a second desire, which was to show the breadth of a love story in time. Its trace. The philosophy of love. So I wanted to make a film about a romantic dialogue, but also about the lovers’ discourse. Finding that balance was decisive before starting to make this film. I had to conjure up the visual set-ups that could do both things. There are effects in time, effects in acceleration, but it’s also a film constructed around rituals and variations, as opposed to big contrasts.\n\nFull interview on Little White Lies"
