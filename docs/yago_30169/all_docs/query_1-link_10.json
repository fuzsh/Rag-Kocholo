        "text": "Mrs. Luba Zarchi, matriarch of a large Lubavitch family and longtime resident of Crown Heights passed away Tuesday, 3 Kislev, 5775.\n\nShe was 94.\n\nMrs. Luba Michle Zarchi was the daughter of R’ Shlomo and Basya Yente Raskin obm. She was the granddaughter of famed Chossid R’ Bentzion Raskin. She was also the granddaughter of famed Chossid R’ Michel Sherdener, son of the Chossid of the Rebbe Rashab R’ Zalman Sherdener, whose fervent Tehillim was the envy of all Chassidim and were mentioned by the Frierdiker Rebbe in Likkutei Diburim.\n\nBorn in Gorki, Russia (today Nizni Novogord), as a young girl growing up under communist rule, Mrs. Zarchi faced many challenges to adhere to her Judaism.\n\nGovernment requirements said she must attend school on Shabbos or her parents faced threats of imprisonment. When she could not give excuses anymore and was forced to attend, she walked miles to and from school. She would come up with excuses not to do writing or schoolwork as well, wrapping her arms in bandages or a cast, and other times bringing doctor’s notes stating she was sick.\n\nShe married R’ Meir Zarchi OBM, a brilliant scholar in both Gemarah and Chassidus, and after their marriage, they finally escaped Russia along with their child in 1946.\n\nIn order to escape, the two had to travel separately and faced grave danger, finally reuniting in Germany.\n\nOnce they settled in New York, the Zarchis were known for their open house, hosting many prominent Rabbonim and other visitors from Russia, Europe and all around the world when they arrived on US shores.\n\nMrs. Zarchi, who was known for her brilliant photographic memory, was always strong and never gave up hope, even after her husband’s untimely death at the age of 59.\n\nAn aristocratic woman of style and taste who was also firmly grounded in a life of Torah and Chassidus, she raised generations of Chassidim and G-d-fearing Jews, many of whom are Shluchim around the world.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Rabbi Shloma Zarchi – Crown Heights; Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Zarchi – Crown Heights; Mrs. Gittel Fischer – Jerusalem, Israel; and Mrs. Leah Kalmenson – Crown Heights.\n\nThe Levaya will take place Wednesday, leaving Shomrei Hadas in Boro Park at 1:30 pm and passing by 770 at 2:15 pm.\n\nShiva:\n\nShiva will take place at 590 Montgomery Street\n\nThursday morning Shachris 8:00, 9:00\n\nMincha b’zman 4:00, 4:15, Maariv 5:00, 5:10\n\nThe rest of days\n\nShachris 7:30, 8:30\n\nMincha b’zman 4:00, 4:15, Maariv 5:00, 5:10\n\nPlease do not visit between 1:00-3:00 pm and after 10:00 pm."
