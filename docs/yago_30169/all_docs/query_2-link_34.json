[Camille Keaton, \"Camille's European Adventures\", DVD Interview Featurette, Dark Sky Films, 2007.]\n\nCareer\n\nShe once worked as a hostess for Amtrak [ [http://retroslashers.net/interviewfarmer.htm Interview With Savage Vengeance's Donald Farmer - Retro Slashers ] ] . Her debut role was in 1972 playing the role of Solange in Massimo Dallamano's movie of the giallo genre entitled \"What Have You Done To Solange?\" Though a small role, her delicate and fragile physique got immediate attention. [R. Ian Jane, \"Camille Keaton\", contained in the 2002 DVD release of \"What Have You Done To Solange?\"] Robert Marcucci says of her role as Solange, \"She truly steals every scene she's in, simply drifting in and out of each of her scenes, her face and mannerisms mysterious and alluring.\" [ Robert Marcucci, \"In Search of Solange\", contained in the 2002 DVD release of \"What Have You Done To Solange?\"]\n\nIn November 1972, Keaton was a Playmen playmate of the month. In September 1974, she was on the cover of Playmen. She won the \"Medalla Sitges en Plata de Ley\" Best Actress award for her performance in \"I Spit on Your Grave\" at the 1978 Catalonian International Film Festival in Spain.\n\nPersonal life\n\nShe was married to Meir Zarchi, the director of \"I Spit on Your Grave\", and was the last wife of film producer Sidney Luft. They were married March 20, 1993 until Luft's death on September 15, 2005. She is the former step-mother of Lorna Luft and Joey Luft. Keaton is neither related to Michael Keaton nor Diane Keaton.\n\nFilmography\n\nControversy\n\n*The model used for the front of the DVD cover of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" is not Keaton—an urban legend persists that Keaton's body-double was in fact Demi Moore, however skeptics say this is unlikely as Moore would have been only 16 at time.\n\n*In the movie \"Savage Vengeance\" she appears under the screen name Vickie Kehl or Vickie Lahl—strangely, 'Kehl' appears on the DVD cover and advertising materials, whereas 'Lahl' appears on the film credit itself. An urban legend exists that footage in this movie was used without her consent and this screen name was fabricated to cover up her identity.
