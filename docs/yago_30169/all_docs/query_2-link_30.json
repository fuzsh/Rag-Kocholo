        "text": "Before starring in the notorious exploitation classic, I Spit on Your Grave, Camille Keaton starred in a series of highly atmospheric, early 70s Italian horror films, three of which are collected here, on Blu-ray, for the first time.\n\n--\n\nMADELEINE:\n\nMadeleine has just endured a traumatizing miscarriage. Finding herself increasingly lost in bizarre nightmares, she begins to question her life and happiness, taking refuge in extra marital affairs and unstoppable hedonism. But how long can she hide from reality before the brutal consequences of her actions catch up to her?\n\nAn eerie, sensual, and character driven mood piece which is highly reliant of unsettling dream sequences, Roberto Mauri's MADELEINE: ANATOMY OF A NIGHTMARE offers one of Camille Keaton's strongest performances, and co-stars Paola Senatore (Eaten Alive), Silvano Tranquilli (Legend of Blood Castle), and Pier Maria Rossi (The Messiah). Sumptuously lensed by veteran cinematographer Carlo Carlini (Autopsy), Vinegar Syndrome is proud to present the world Blu-ray debut of MADELEINE, newly restored in 4K from its original camera negative and presented for the first time in its English language version, with Keaton's original English dialogue finally able to be heard.\n\ndirected by: Roberto Mauri\n\nstarring: Camille Keaton, Paola Senatore, Silvano Tranquilli, Pier Maria Rossi\n\n1974 / 102 min / 2.35:1 / English Mono\n\nAdditional info:\n\nRegion Free Blu-ray\n\nNewly scanned & restored in 4k from its 35mm original camera negative\n\nCommentary track with actress Camille Keaton & Art Ettinger\n\n“Passport to Kill” - a brand new interview with actress Camille Keaton\n\nAudio essay by film historian and critic Rachael Nisbet\n\nAlternate Italian ‘Burning Baby’ sequence\n\nOriginal trailer\n\nCamille Keaton Still Gallery\n\nReversible cover artwork\n\nEnglish SDH subtitles\n\n--\n\nTRAGIC CEREMONY:\n\nA foursome of young friends, enjoying themselves in the countryside, happen upon a secluded villa. Believing the place to be empty, they decide to investigate, only to stumble upon a grisly, in progress satanic rite. Barely escaping with their lives, it's not long before evil forces begin to torment them...\n\nBest known for its bonkers, mid-film massacre, Riccardo Freda's (Iguana With the Tongue of Fire) Spanish-Italian co-production, TRAGIC CEREMONY is a gore heavy supernatural horror treat that dispenses normal logic in favor of ever mounting weirdness. Starring Camille Keaton, Tony Isbert (No One Heard the Scream), Luciana Paluzzi (Thunderball), and veteran Italian character actor Luigi Pistilli (The Good the Bad and the Ugly), and scored by maestro Stelvio Cipriani (A Bay of Blood), Vinegar Syndrome is excited to present the Blu-ray debut of TRAGIC CEREMONY, newly restored from its original negative.\n\ndirected by: Riccardo Freda\n\nstarring: Camille Keaton, Tony Isbert, Máximo Valverde, Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi\n\n1972 / 87 min / 1.85:1 / Italian Mono (with English subtitles)\n\nAdditional info:\n\nRegion Free Blu-ray\n\nNewly scanned & restored in 2k from its 35mm original camera negative\n\nCommentary track with film historian and author Samm Deighan\n\n“Camille’s European Adventures” - an archival interview with actress Camille Keaton\n\nCamille Keaton Still Gallery\n\nReversible cover artwork\n\nEnglish SDH subtitles\n\n--\n\nSEX OF THE WITCH:\n\nThe wealthy patriarch of the Hilton family has just died, and his heirs have gathered at the family castle to collect on their inheritances. However, it's not long before a black clad killer strikes, bumping off several members of the Hilton clan, in gruesome fashion. As the police begin their investigation, long buried secrets are revealed, including curses and connections to black magic.\n\nAn almost impossibly trashy mix of gothic horror, sex drama, and giallo overtones, Angelo Pannacciò's (Holocaust II) SEX OF THE WITCH is a gloriously perverse slice of Eurosleaze. Featuring Camille Keaton alongside Jessica Dublin (Toxic Avenger II & III), Franco Garofalo (Virus), and Donald O'Brien (Zombie Holocaust), Vinegar Syndrome presents the world Blu-ray debut of SEX OF THE WITCH, newly restored from its original techniscope negative and including nearly 10 minutes of additional, long lost, sex!\n\ndirected by: Angelo Pannacciò\n\nstarring: Camille Keaton, Jessica Dublin, Franco Garofalo, Donald O'Brien\n\n1973 / 95 min / 2.35:1 / Italian Mono (with English subtitles)\n\nAdditional info:"
