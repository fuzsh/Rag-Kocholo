They were divorced.\n\nHe was the third husband of Judy Garland, his second wife, whom he married in 8 June 1952 in San Benito, California.[3] They were the parents of two children and divorced 19 May 1965.\n\nHe married Patricia Hemingway in 1972 in New York City.[4] They divorced in 1980.[5]\n\nHe married Camille Keaton in 1993.[6]\n\nHe passed away in 2005.[7]\n\nObituary:[8]\n\nSid Luft Dies in California\n\nBy Ian Gregor, The Associated Press\n\nLos Angeles--Producer Sid Luft, who is credited with reviving the career of his then-wife, Judy Garlind, in the 1950s, has died. He was 89.\n\nLuft, whose movie production credits included \"Kilroy was Here\" 1947; \"French Leave\" 1948; and \"A Star is Born\" 1854, died Thursday in Santa Monica of an apparent heart attack, John Kimble, a longtime friend and business partenr of Luft, said Friday.\n\nLuft and Garland were married in 1952 and divorced a tumultuous 13 years later. The marriage was Garland's third and Luft's third.\n\nThey had two children together, Lorna in 1952 and Joey in 1955. Luft also was stepfather to singer and actress Liza Minnelli, who Garland had with director Vincente Minnelli in 1946.\n\nLuft was credited with helping resurrect Garland's career after she was released from her contract at MGM in 1950 following a series of personal and professional crises. It was at MGM that she became a star and made such films as \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\"\n\nLuft, as Garland's manager and agent, produced stage shows for her in London and New York and then brought her back to motion pictures, said Coyne Steven Sanders, Luft's longtime friend and author of the 1990 Garland biography \"Rainbow's End.\"\n\n\"A Star Is born,\" produced by Luft and directed by George Cukor, brought Garland an Academy Award nomination for best actress. The oft-filmed story of a troubled movie star whose career is over=shadowed by that of his protegee also got five other nominations including for best actor (James Mason), best score and best song.\n\nLuft in 1995 also successfully produced a special show for CBS that marked Garland's first appearance on television.\n\nGarland professionally turned to Luft again in 1966 and he booked her on U.S. and international stage tours, Sanders said. \"Sid was a great showman, he had great instincts and he knew how to package and put together a show,\" Sanders said. \"Certainly, I can say, knowing him, that Judy was the love of his life. He still loved her and always did.\"\n\nAfter he and Garland divorced, Luft married Patti Hemingway in 1970. That union also ended in divorce. He married actress Camille Keaton in 1993.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Sid Luft Biography on Wikipedia.\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K82K-F9F : 8 December 2017), Sidney Luft and Marjorie Fisher, 28 Nov 1943; citing Los Angeles, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 2,135,491.\n\n↑ \"California, County Marriages, 1850-1952,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K8XR-7RP : 10 December 2017), Michael Sidney Luft and Frances G Minnelli, 08 Jun 1952; citing San Benito, California, United States, county courthouses, California; FHL microfilm 1,908,729.\n\n↑ \"New York, New York City Marriage Licenses Index, 1950-1995,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QLSL-C4CM : 19 June 2017), Michael Luft and Patricia Hemingway, 1972, Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States;Marriage, Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States, from Reclaim the Records, The NYC Marriage Index (http://www.nycmarriageindex.com : 2016); citing New York City Clerk's Office.\n\n↑ \"California Divorce Index, 1966-1984,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VPPC-WVY : 27 November 2014), Michael S Luft and Patricia S, 15 Feb 1980; from \"California Divorce Index, 1966-1984,\" database and images, Ancestry (http://www.ancestry.com : 2007); citing Los Angeles, California, Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento.\n\n↑ \"Nevada Marriage Index, 1956-2005,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VV6D-7VK : 9 December 2014), Michael Sidney Luft and Camille Keaton, 20 Mar 1993; from \"Nevada, Marriage Index, 1956-2005,\" database, Ancestry (http://www.ancestry.com : 2007); citing Clark, Nevada, United States, County Book 331, p.
