Mr. Keaton was a devoted husband of 54 years, loving father to three daughters and beloved \"Papa\" to six grandchildren. After a successful career in the shoe business, he enjoyed his retirement celebrating milestones with his family, hosting epic tailgate parties that welcomed friends and strangers alike, and loudly and enthusiastically supporting Vanderbilt and Nashville athletic teams. Mr. Keaton was born on Aug. 18, 1935, in Brownsville, Tenn., to William C. and Lillian Stephens Keaton and moved to Hohenwald, Tenn., as a young boy. He played basketball for Lewis County High School, from which he graduated in 1953. Mr. Keaton earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Vanderbilt University and served two years in the U.S. Army. While a student, he worked part-time in the psychiatric ward at Vanderbilt hospital, where he met a nursing student, Belma Ree (Totsie) Wallace. They were married on December 21, 1958. Mr. Keaton worked in manufacturing for Genesco for 21 years, then worked for Bass Shoe Company in Maine and Carolina Shoe in Morganton, N.C. He also was a consultant for Wolverine World Wide. He and his wife returned to Brentwood in 1996 and were members of Brentwood United Methodist Church. Survivors include his wife, Belma (Totsie) Wallace Keaton; daughters Susan (Lance Wegner) of Naperville, Ill.; Beth (Bud) Archie of Franklin and Kay of Brentwood; six grandchildren, Nick Garretson, Samantha Archie, Chad Trask, Lauren Wegner, Brandon Wegner and Rachel Wegner; his sister, Camille Kelley of Hohenwald; and numerous nieces and nephews.
