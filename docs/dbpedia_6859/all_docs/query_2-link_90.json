In November, Justice was interviewed for the Bay State Banner by fellow Boston artist and activist L’Merchie Frazier. In June 2022, he was the subject of a Boston Globe article about his History Is No Mystery exhibition at Boston’s Fountain Street Gallery; a later exhibition, History Is No Mystery: The Conversation Continues, ran at the Hopkinton Center for the Arts in 2023.\n\nJustice is a member of Northeastern University’s African American Master Artists-in-Residence Program."
