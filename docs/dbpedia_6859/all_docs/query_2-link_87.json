So lab tests of your blood, urine, and other body fluids that measure these substances can help doctors make a diagnosis. However, abnormal lab results are not a sure sign of cancer. Lab test results are used along with the results of other tests, such as biopsies and imaging, to help diagnose and learn more about a person’s cancer.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that lab results for healthy people can vary from person to person. Reasons for these differences include age, sex, race, medical history, and general health. In fact, your own results can vary from day to day. Because normal results can bounce around a bit, they are often reported in a range, with lower and upper limits. These ranges are based on test results from large numbers of people who have been tested in the past.\n\nFor many tests, it is possible to have normal results even if you have cancer. And it is possible to have test results outside the normal range even if you are healthy. These are some of the reasons why lab tests alone can’t say for sure if you have cancer or any other disease.\n\nYour doctor is the best person to explain your lab test results and what they mean for you.\n\nSome common types of lab tests used to help diagnose cancer are listed below.\n\nBlood chemistry test\n\nWhat it does: A blood chemistry test measures the amounts of certain substances that are released into the blood by the organs and tissues of the body. These substances include metabolites, electrolytes, fats, sugars, and proteins, including enzymes.\n\nWhat it tells us: Blood chemistry tests give important information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. High or low levels of some substances in the blood can be a sign of disease or treatment side effects.\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\n\nWhat it does: The CBC measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. It also measures the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in your blood, the amount of your blood that is made up of red blood cells (hematocrit), the size of your red blood cells, and the amount of hemoglobin in your red blood cells.\n\nHow it is used: The CBC is often part of a routine health check-up. It can help diagnose some cancers, especially leukemias. It is also used to monitor your health during and after treatment.\n\nHave Questions?\n\nConnect with our cancer information specialists.\n\nPhone: 1-800-4-CANCER\n\nChat: LiveHelp\n\nEmail: NCIinfo@nih.gov\n\nAvailable Monday–Friday 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nCytogenetic analysis\n\nWhat it does: Cytogenetic analysis looks for changes in chromosomes in samples of tissue, blood, bone marrow, or amniotic fluid. Chromosome changes may include broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of a genetic condition or some types of cancer.\n\nHow it is used: Cytogenetic analysis may be used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\n\nImmunophenotyping\n\nWhat it does: Immunophenotyping uses antibodies to identify cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. It is most often done on blood or bone marrow samples. But it may also be done on other body fluids or tissue samples.\n\nHow it is used: Immunophenotyping helps diagnose, stage, and monitor blood cancers and other blood disorders, such as leukemias, lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders.\n\nLiquid biopsy\n\nWhat it does: Liquid biopsy is a test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells or pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are sometimes released into the blood.\n\nHow it is used: A liquid biopsy may help find cancer at an early stage. It may also be used to help plan treatment or to find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back.\n\nSputum cytology\n\nWhat it does: Sputum cytology looks for abnormal cells in sputum, which is mucus and other matter brought up from the lungs by coughing.\n\nHow it is used: Sputum cytology can help diagnose lung cancer.\n\nTumor marker tests\n\nWhat they do: Tests for tumor markers measure substances that are produced by cancer cells or other cells of the body in response to cancer. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells. But they are produced at much higher levels by cancer cells.\n\nHow they are used: Tumor markers can be used to help diagnose cancer, decide on treatment, measure how well treatment worked, and watch for signs that the cancer has returned.\n\nLearn more about tumor markers.\n\nUrinalysis\n\nWhat it does: Urinalysis describes the color of urine and measures its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.\n\nHow it is used: Urinalysis can help diagnose kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and rarer urothelial cancers.\n\nUrine cytology\n\nWhat it does: Urine cytology finds disease by looking for abnormal cells shed from the urinary tract into the urine.\n\nHow it is used: Urine cytology helps diagnose kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and rarer urothelial cancers. After cancer treatment, it is used to watch for signs that cancer has returned.\n\nImaging tests used in cancer\n\nImaging tests create pictures of areas inside your body that help the doctor see whether a tumor is present. These pictures can be made in several ways.\n\nCT scan\n\nA CT scan uses an x-ray machine linked to a computer to take a series of pictures of your organs from different angles. These pictures are used to create detailed 3-D images of the inside of your body.\n\nSometimes, you may receive a dye or other contrast material before you have the scan. You might swallow the dye, or it may be given by a needle into a vein. Contrast material helps make the pictures easier to read by highlighting certain areas in the body.\n\nDuring the CT scan, you will lie still on a table that slides into a donut-shaped scanner. The CT machine moves around you, taking pictures.\n\nLearn more about CT scans and how they are used to diagnose cancer.\n\nMRI\n\nAn MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to take pictures of your body in slices. These slices are combined to create detailed images of the inside of your body, which can show places where there may be tumors.\n\nWhen you have an MRI, you lie still on a table that is pushed into a long chamber that surrounds part or all of your body. The MRI machine makes loud thumping noises and rhythmic beats.\n\nSometimes, you might have a special dye injected into your vein before or during your MRI exam. This dye, called a contrast agent, can make tumors show up brighter in the pictures.\n\nNuclear scan\n\nA nuclear scan uses radioactive material to take pictures of the inside of the body. This type of scan may also be called a radionuclide scan.\n\nBefore this scan, you receive an injection of a small amount of radioactive material, which is sometimes called a tracer. It flows through your bloodstream and collects in certain bones or organs.\n\nDuring the scan, you lie still on a table while a machine called a scanner detects and measures the radioactivity in your body, creating pictures of bones or organs on a computer screen or on film.\n\nAfter the scan, the radioactive material in your body will lose its radioactivity over time. It may also leave your body through your urine or stool.\n\nBone scan\n\nBone scans are a type of nuclear scan that check for abnormal areas or damage in the bones. They may be used to diagnose bone cancer or find out whether cancer has spread to the bones from elsewhere in the body (called metastatic bone tumors).\n\nBefore this test, a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into your vein. As it travels through the blood, the material collects in abnormal areas in the bone. Areas where the material collects show up on pictures taken by a special scanner. These areas are called “hot spots.”\n\nPET scan\n\nA PET scan is a type of nuclear scan that makes detailed 3-D pictures of areas inside your body where glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than healthy cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer in the body.\n\nBefore the scan, you receive an injection of a tracer called radioactive glucose. During the scan, you will lie still on a table that moves back and forth through a scanner.\n\nUltrasound\n\nAn ultrasound exam uses high-energy sound waves that people cannot hear. The sound waves echo off tissues inside your body. A computer uses these echoes to create pictures of areas inside your body. This picture is called a sonogram.\n\nDuring an ultrasound exam, you will lie on a table while a technologist slowly moves a device called a transducer, which makes the high-energy sound waves, on the skin over the part of the body that is being examined. The transducer is covered with a warm gel that helps it glide over the skin.\n\nX-rays\n\nX-rays use low doses of radiation to create pictures inside your body. An x-ray technologist will put you in position and direct the x-ray beam to the correct part of your body. While the images are taken, you will need to stay very still and may need to hold your breath for a second or two."
