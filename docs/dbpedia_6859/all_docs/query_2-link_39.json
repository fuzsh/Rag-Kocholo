        "text": "Ran (1985) is Akira Kurosawa’s late period masterpiece. The late period work of artists whose careers span decades is not judged independent of their journey. To be respected the artist must follow their own muse at this point. For example, Bob Dylan’s album “Tempest” is definitely an album worthy of its existence. It follows themes he’d explored for years, not conforming to popular tastes, but no one expects it to be in the same league as the work he did in his prime during the 60s and 70s in terms of accessibility, energy, inventiveness, clarity and overall quality. Ran is as good as any film Kurosawa ever made. He made it at 75. It has the craft and wisdom of a life fully lived with the passion and accessibility usually associated with a younger man’s work.\n\nWarning– this post contains spoilers. To find out if I recommend the film or not, skip to Final Verdict.\n\nRan is Kurosawa’s loose adaptation of King Lear. Enough is changed, (three daughters are here three sons), removed (the Edmund & Edward plotline is gone) and added (the eldest daughter-in-law, Lady Kaede played by Mieko Harada, is an addition) that this is almost completely Kurosawa’s vision. This vision is uncompromisingly bleak. It’s not a darkness of glib cynicism. Twenty years prior, Red Beard was an ode to the inherent goodness of man. Now Kurosawa sees man’s main qualities as greed, vanity, and self-destruction. This is the vision of an artist who has tried to see the goodness in humanity and has now been disappointed so many times he sees life as blind suffering.\n\nThe movie begins in a place of relative peace. The region has been in violent conflict for decades, but now it has stabilized into a stable situation. This is because the warlord, Hidetora Ichimonji (the Lear character performed by Tatsuya Nakadai) has destroyed or intimidated all enemies. The opening scene is Nakadai hunting a wild boar as part of a diplomatic meeting with foreign leaders. These are peaceful negotiations, it’s an ordered environment, but it’s still a deeply violent situation. During this trip Nakadai makes the two mistakes that lead him and the entire world of the film into chaos. First he decides to retire and divide his kingdom among his children. Second he rejects and exiles Saburo (played by Daisuke Ryu) the one son who has his best interests at heart. The decision to divide the kingdom is doomed because Nakadai has built his peace on war. He wants to walk away from the violence he has fostered unscathed. It’s redemption without work. In the world of this film redemption is presented as harder than in any of Kurosawa’s other films (with the exception of The Lower Depths) and ultimately impossible. The choice to exile his son is based on vanity. He sees criticism as disloyalty while being blind to the actual traitorous actions of everyone else in his midst. Almost immediately his remaining sons start to turn on him. His full downfall takes place about an hour into the film. After the sons turn him out of their castles, and lead an attack on his remaining armed forces, he is broken. His kingdom and stature are stripped, but this is not the end of the film. The rest of the movie tracks everyone’s failure. The sons are unable to maintain a kingdom, Nakadai is unable to find redemption, and the half dozen smaller characters in the court are in a war founded on nothing but greed. Only one person in Ran fully achieves their goals: Harada. Her goal is not power or even to survive. She wants to destroy the Nakadai’s family. She is successful in part because this world is more inclined to destruction than peace and creation. In fact the movie suggests there can be no peace for man.\n\nNakadai is driven insane by his experiences, but there is still hope. His one loyal son will return and they will be reunited. He may have lost his title, but he may still acknowledge his mistakes and become a better man. The film hints at this ending, but then cruelly takes it away from the audience when suddenly both son and father in that order are killed. There cannot be a happy ending because man creates the cruel chaos of the world. This is not a larger force of nature pushing this world into pain. It’s man’s actions that lead to pain. If there is a God, man can’t see him. This is made clear in the final scene.\n\nThe final scene belongs to Tsurumaru (played by Takeshi Nomura). He was blinded by Nakadai as a youth when his family’s lands were conquered. He is the living embodiment of the sins Nakadai committed. He has spent his life living in a small shack, alone playing his flute.\n\nHis deeply religious sister, who was spared to marry Nakadai’s son, kept him alive. When things start to deteriorate and it becomes clear to the sister, Lady Sue (Yoshiko Miyazaki), that her life is in jeopardy, she plans to flee with her brother. She will do this once she retrieves his flute. It is while completing this task that she is murdered. All that Nomura has left of her is a scroll of Buddha. The movie closes with him, a blind man, on a cliff in some ruins. Stumbling around, he drops his scroll. He is alone, hoping that his actions will not lead to his death while God is literally out of reach.\n\nThe argument has been made that the point of view of the film is of a higher power looking down on the failures of man. This is partly thematic but also because of the style of the film. The film is precise, colorful, and a step removed. It’s counter-intuitive in its choices. It’s a movie of long shots, taking away close ups and therefore audience identification. It’s a bleak film, but its not shot in a way that traditionally signifies bleakness. The colors of this film are precise and vibrant. It takes the color-coded armies of Kagemusha and improves on them. Each son has his own color and his army follows suit.\n\nThe film doesn’t allow us to know the character’s faces that well, but because of the color-coding the identities are never in doubt, a problem Kagemusha suffered from. Sometimes it feels unfair to compare Ran and Kagemusha, since one feels like a first draft of the other, but it allows us to examine the triumphs of Ran more clearly. Though it must be said that Nakadai gives wonderful lead performances in both films. His arc here is the opposite of Tashiki Shimura in Ikiru where the lead moves from complete pitifulness to complete strength. Here Nakadai moves from being a formidable warrior (he can still easily kill a man) and respected leader to a shell of a human being. It’s to the credit of both Kurosawa and Nakadai that the transformation seems not only believable, but the only logical outcome.\n\nKurosawa has examined insanity in the past with The Idiot, I Live in Fear, and to a lesser degree The Lower Depths, but Nakadai’s downfall is considered his ultimate statement on the subject. The character’s tragic fate is not that he dies, but that he doesn’t die. The final attack on his castle is one of the most beautifully horrific scenes in cinema. It is an odd combination of graphic violence and emotional distance. The audience sees a wide scale slaughter, men with the hands cut off, women committing mutual suicide and an inferno of fire. We see it, but we don’t hear it. All we hear is mournful music. By doing this, the scene manages to neither sanitize nor exploit the violence.\n\nThis is actually the last of his movies to depict violence (Dreams and Rhapsody in August both deal with the destructiveness of nuclear power, but it’s not explicitly depicted on screen). For a director who revolutionized violence on screen, an influence still felt today, he decided for his final statement on the subject to not be an entertaining battle, but a tableau of hell where violence is a cycle that can’t be broken. Kurosawa created similar visions of hellish landscapes, (High and Low, and Kagemusha), but they had been the end point of those stories. Here it is the turning point. Nakadai attempts ritual suicide, but he has no sword. Now he must stand in a burning castle (real fire) while holding himself violently still. All his status, identity, and abilities are stripped from him. All that is left is shame for his choices and former vanity. Like I Live in Fear, his insanity is the only sane response to an insane world, but he’s not blameless for his situation. This came about because of how ruthless and violent of a man he was. Nobody get’s off easy here. The character who appears most appealing to the audience by the end is arguably the villain of the film.\n\nHarada’s character and performance is the strongest and most fully formed presentation of a woman in Kurosawa’s filmography. That might sound like faint praise given his notorious problem with lack of female roles in his movies, but Lady Kaede is one the greatest characters in his films of either gender. The character could have been a hysterical psychopath with no internal life, but here her reasons are understandable and her manipulations are so precise and effective that the audience starts to complete the picture of her inner life. Her best scene is an attack and a seduction. She brings stillness and calculation to presenting her dead husband’s helmet to the man who had him killed, his brother. It’s immediately discarded when it’s revealed to only be a ploy to get a knife to the new leader’s neck. It’s filmed in medium shots with long takes. By doing so Kurosawa emphases the full body performance she gives contrasting the speed with stillness without tricking the audience with fast cuts. She goes through so many different personas in the scene; meek widow, deranged killer, passionate sex fiend (the kiss, which is Kurosawa’s fifth and final kiss in his movies, involves a lot of blood and knife play) and lastly a wounded lover. She is in complete control and it’s clear that each persona is a performance to provoke a reaction. Kurosawa shows it’s an act by contrasting her wounded tears with her coldly killing a beetle. It suggests an alternate inner life that we aren’t seeing which makes her feel like a living character and not a sexist cliché.\n\nRan is the most accessible film Kurosawa made in decades if only because it’s better paced. Earlier in his career Kurosawa was a master at establishing a film’s central conflict in the first few minutes (think the stolen gun in Stray Dog, stomach cancer in Ikiru, and the bandits in Seven Samurai) and then barreling forward from that point. After High and Low his films lost that momentum. They became more elongated and shapeless. Ran is not as immediately economic as something like Stray Dog, but it moves much better than Kagemusha or Dersu Ulaza. Each scene is propelling the next. Its speed and urgency feel like a young man’s film, but it’s themes and emotions come from a lifetime of wisdom.\n\nThere are three films that constitute Kurosawa’s climaxes of philosophical breakthrough. Ikiru is a culmination of his post war career. It takes all the issues he had been dealing with in his earlier films and makes them into one cohesive statement about his country’s soul. Red Beard was the end result of his fable like genre films creating an epic ode to the capacity of human kindness. Ran is a howl of optimism driven to despair. After Red Beard Kurosawa suffered. Every subsequent film he made was an epic struggle to complete. Each was a financial disappointment and artistically they paled in comparison to his earlier work. It’s well documented that he was depressed enough to attempt suicide. No matter how hard he worked or the acclaim he received overseas, he could never find funding in his homeland (Ran received funding from France). He saw making Ran as his personal mission for his life. It took so long that he had time to paint storyboards for the entire film. He was 75 years old when he filmed it, his eyesight was greatly diminished and his wife of almost 40 years (the lead in The Most Beautiful) died during filming. In the end he birthed a masterpiece. It was a hit both financially and critically. It revitalized his career and reputation. Through the intense struggle and pain of the latter half of his life he created an uncompromising film that allowed for a happy ending of his own life.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nRan is as great a masterpiece as anything else in Kurosawa’s filmography. It’s as large and well conceived in scale as Seven Samurai while being as personal and as honest of a statement as Ikiru. It bears the weight of his legendary career while being easily accessible to people who have never seen one of his films. You should watch this."
