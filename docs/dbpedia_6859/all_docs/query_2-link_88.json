        "text": "This is the story of how a dog helped save a small Alaskan town...\n\nIn 1925, diphtheria swept through the small Alaskan town of Nome. Located 2 degrees south of the Arctic Circle, Nome was home to 455 Alaskan Natives and 975 European settlers. Between November and July, the port into Nome on the southern shore of Seward Peninsula in the Bering sea was icebound and inaccessible by steamship. During this time the only link to the rest of the world, was the Iditarod Trail, which runs 938 miles from the port of Seward to Nome.\n\nSeveral months before the winter of 1924-1925, Curtis Welch, the only doctor in Nome, ordered more diphtheria antitoxin. Dr. Welch had discovered that the batch at the 25-bed Maynard Columbus Hospital had expired. Unfortunately, the shipment did not arrive before the port closed for the winter. Within days of the last ship leaving the port, Dr. Welch treated a few children for what he first diagnosed as tonsillitis. Over the next few weeks, the cases on tonsillitis grew and four children died. Dr. Welch began to get concerned about the possibility of diphtheria.\n\nBy mid-January, Dr. Welch made the first official diagnosis of diphtheria in a three-year old boy; the child later died two weeks after displaying the first symptoms. The next day a seven-year old girl died. Realizing that an epidemic was imminent, Dr. Welch called Mayor George Maynard to arrange an emergency meeting. A quarantine was immediately implemented. Despite this, there were over 20 confirmed cases of diphtheria and at least 50 more at risk by the end of the month. Without antitoxin, they believed that the mortality rate could be close to 100 percent.\n\nSince no plane or ship could reach the isolated town, a unanimous decision was made to use multiple dogsled teams to transport the medicine across the dangerous land. Though Balto often gets the credit for saving the town of Nome, it was Togo, a Siberian Husky, who led his team across the most dangerous leg of the journey."
