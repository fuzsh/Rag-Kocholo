        "text": "I. The pioneers of Lepidoptera research in Iran (1796 to 1913)\n\nThe early naturalists, explorers and collectors who travelled to Iran in the 18th century either did not collect Lepidoptera or their Lepidoptera collections are lost to time. Among them was German physician and botanist Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1744–1774), who travelled to the northern provinces of Iran between the years 1770 and 1774 and was later known for his work on the flora of Siberia. Some other naturalists (e.g., K. E. Von Eichwald, P. M. R. Aucher-Éloy, F. De Filippi and N. A. Zarudny) collected insects, including Lepidoptera, but no published work based on these preserved collections is known. Many of the classical collectors who travelled to Iran in later years were motivated and funded by the Grand Duke of Russia, Konstantin Nikolayevich (Romanov), who recruited people to collect for him and even employed some of them to work as curators in his vast collection (see below).\n\nGuillaume-Antoine Olivier (*19.i.1756, Les Arcs, near Toulon – †1.x.1814, Lyon) (Fig. 4a). Originally a French medical doctor from the Montpellier Faculty of Medicine, Olivier solidified himself as the first confirmed entomologist to research and collect Lepidoptera in Iran. Although Olivier studied medicine, his passion lay in the natural sciences, which ultimately motivated him to accept the position of insect collector for Jean-Baptiste-François Gigot d'Orcy, a naturalist and patron of the arts who owned a large insect collection. Olivier eventually found his specialty in Coleoptera, publishing his magnum opus on beetles (“Entomologie, ou, Histoire naturelle des insectes: avec leurs caractères génériques et spécifiques, leur description, leur synonymie, et leur enluminée Coléoptères”, 1789–1808, in 6 volumes, with 363 plates). In 1792, he travelled to the Ottoman Empire, Persia and Egypt, reaching Iran in 1796. This expedition, financed by the French government as part of cultural and environmental studies on the Middle East, took six years. Olivier collected a large number of insects during his travels, of which a majority are deposited in the National Museum of Natural History (Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, MNHN) of Paris, whereas smaller collections are deposited in the Museum of Edinburgh. Upon his return to France, Olivier published a report about his long expedition, in three volumes (Olivier 1801–1807). In over 1,000 pages, Olivier described not only his scientific observations but also many aspects of the cultural issues, lifestyle and economic condition of the Middle Eastern countries, especially within the Ottoman Empire. Two years after this expedition, Olivier became professor of zoology at the Alfort National Veterinary School, just outside of Paris. Amongst the Lepidoptera specimens that Olivier collected in Iran, those of Zygaena cuvieri Boisduval, [1828], most probably collected at Alvand Mt. in Hamadan, are certainly the highlight and mark the beginning of Iranian lepidopterology. Curiously, Olivier himself was not the one who originally described this species. It was ultimately described as a new species by his fellow countryman and entomologist Jean Baptiste Alphonse de Chauffour de Boisduval (1799–1879) and named after famed naturalist Georges Léopold Chrétien Frédéric Dagobert, Baron de Cuvier (1769–1832), the father of comparative anatomy (see Hofmann & Tremewan 2020: 59).\n\nKarl Georg Theodor Kotschy (*15.iv.1813, Ustron, Österreichisch-Schlesien – †11.vi.1866, Vienna) (Fig. 4b). Famed Austrian botanist Theodor Kotschy visited the southern parts of Iran starting on February 2nd, 1842, when from Khark Island in the northern Persian Gulf he managed to book passage with a caravan to Dalaki (prov. Bushehr) and then onward to Shiraz (Fig. 3). According to Kollar & Redtenbacher (1849), the journey from Dalaki to Shiraz was fraught with both danger and dilemmas. The caravan often took remote and precarious roads to avoid the possibility of bandit attacks. This unfortunately meant that Kotschy was unable to collect much on the way to Shiraz. However, he was able to report about the different vegetation that he observed during the trip, such as lemon and orange plantations at Kazerun, followed by an oak forest mixed with low maple and Amygdalus shrubs. He also reported about the presence of numerous waterfalls in Dasht-e Arjan, reminiscent of the most beautiful landscapes in Switzerland. According to his report, in the oak forests of Dasht-e Arjan, the lions which resided in the region during the summer months were often a nuisance to the numerous grazing herds and their shepherds, as well as to passing travellers such as Kotschy himself. Although the main purpose of Kotschy's expeditions was to study the flora, he also collected insects during his trip, primarily around Shiraz. Seven years later, two Austrian entomologists, Vincenz Kollar (1797–1860) and Ludwig Redtenbacher (1814–1876), published the first scientific paper on the Lepidoptera of South Iran (Kollar & Redtenbacher 1849), based largely on the material collected by Kotschy. In this paper, the authors listed 48 species of Lepidoptera, including 18 new species.\n\nTheophil Joachim Heinrich Bienert (known as Theophil Bienert) (*3.iii.1833, Kandau – †5.iv.1873, Riga) (Fig. 4c). Possibly the first targeted collecting of butterflies and moths in Iran was that by Theophil Bienert, a Latvian pharmacist, botanist and entomologist who took part in an expedition to Iran and Afghanistan organized with the special interest and financial support of the Grand Duke of Russia, Konstantin Nikolayevich, and led by Nikolai Wladimirowitch Chanykow, the Russian geographer, orientalist and diplomat. During the journey, which began in the winter of 1858 and lasted until the summer of 1860, the geography, geology, flora and fauna of the Northern and Eastern Iranian Plateau were studied. The group travelled from Tiflis (Georgia) via the Caspian Sea to Mazandaran and Golestan (Iran) (Fig. 3). They crossed the Alborz Mts. towards the south and visited one of the most important classical lepidopterological localities, namely Shakuh Mt. (prov. Semnan). The research team of Chanykow continued eastwards towards Khorasan and arrived at Mashhad after visiting Sabzewar and Binaloud (Neyshabur). Two months later, they passed Torbat-e Jaam towards Herat in Afghanistan. After a few weeks' rest in Herat, the group's naturalists broke off briefly and travelled for a few weeks to central Iran and, after visiting Tabas, came back to Herat. The reunited group again travelled through eastern Afghanistan towards Sistan and then to the Lut Desert and Kerman. The expedition continued towards Yazd, Tehran and westwards to Tabriz. The group left for Nakhichevan, ending the excursion in Tiflis on July 15th, 1859 (Fig. 3). It took ten years for Bienert to analyze the results of his journey and finally submit a report on the expedition, along with a list of the collected Lepidoptera, as part of his Ph.D. dissertation (Bienert [1870]). He listed the 380 Lepidoptera species known from Iran at that time and summarized their distributions as present or absent in other neighbouring territories (Turkey, Caucasus, Transcaucasus and Central Asia). He described eight new species from Iran. Bienert's visit and later publication (Bienert [1870]) likely motivated Hugo Christoph to go back to this hidden paradise in the 1870s, to discover a plethora of new species.\n\nJean Édouard Ménétries (*2.i.1802, Paris – †10.iv.1861, Saint Petersburg) (Fig. 4d). A French lepidopterist and coleopterist, Ménétries was a curator at the Zoological Museum of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Although some authors (e.g., Alipanah 2004) have regarded Ménétries as the first author to publish on the Lepidoptera of Iran, he studied the fauna of the Caucasus up to the borders of Iran (Ménétries 1832). As a pioneer lepidopterist, he also studied the faunas of the Transcaucasus and other countries around Iran, and the fauna of northern Iran near the end of his life (Ménétries 1859, 1860).\n\nJulius Lederer (*24.vi.1821, Vienna – †30.iv.1870, Vienna) (Fig. 4e). A well-known classical lepidopterist, Julius Lederer was born in Vienna, Austria. During his stay in Bohemian Asch (now in Czechia), he was influenced by his mentor, a local pharmacist named Hering, and became enamoured with the world of insects, especially butterflies and moths. He finished his university studies in business, all the while continuing to expand his collection of Lepidoptera. With dreams of cataloguing all of the world's Lepidoptera, Lederer travelled extensively outside of Europe, with many trips to the Middle East to collect exotic species (Zeller 1871). Lederer was a diligent and conservative taxonomist, avoiding the unnecessary description of new species when he could not find sufficiently diagnostic characters. His keen eyes and attention to species descriptions led to most of his species withstanding the test of time and synonymy. Aside from his sensitive and often irritable nature, he was an extremely generous and helpful collaborator to his peers (Zeller 1871). He often worked with and contributed to the works of other contemporary lepidopterists such as Otto Staudinger. Besides his work on the Lepidoptera fauna of the European countries, Turkey and Cyprus, his works on the material collected by Moravian lepidopterist Joseph Haberhauer (1828–1902) during his 1867 trip to northern Iran (Golestan and Shakuh) are of special interest (Lederer 1869, 1870). Haberhauer's trip, especially to the regions around Hajiabad and Shakuh, provided a treasure trove of material for Lederer, who identified 258 species of Lepidoptera from this area alone. Unfortunately, Lederer died prematurely from lung disease when he was only 49 years old. After his death, his collection was merged with that of Otto Staudinger.\n\nHugo Theodor Christoph (*16.iv.1831, Herrnhut – †5.xi.1894, Saint Petersburg) (Fig 4f). As a talented German lepidopterist, Hugo Christoph formed the basis for understanding the scope of the Lepidoptera fauna of Iran. Christoph was born in Herrnhut (Saxony) and moved to the Old Sarepta district (now Krasnoarmeysky, Russia) to work as a teacher in a protestant mission station of the Brothers of Herrnhut at the age of 27. In Old Sarepta, he began collecting the local fauna and joined the Entomological Society of Russia. In the 1870s, he made several expeditions to different parts of the Russian Empire, Central Asia, the Caucasus, Transcaucasus and Iran. Later, in 1880, he was employed by the Grand Duke of Russia, Nikolai Michailowitsch (Romanov) as a collector and curator of his collection in Saint Petersburg. This golden age in the life of Christoph made him one of the most legendary lepidopterists of his time; he described a large number of species and formed an expansive private collection. He died after a stroke in 1894, when he was only 63 years old. His wife sold part of his collection, later transferred to the Natural History Museum in London, to Thomas de Grey (6th Baron Walsingham) and another part to Otto Staudinger and Andreas Bang-Haas (Horn et al. 1990), with the rest of the collection kept in the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg. CHRISTOPH visited North Iran at least four times in 1879, 1871, 1873 and 1876, and his studies highlighted the rich and diverse fauna of Shakuh, an extremely important nature reserve, and of the Kopet-Dagh Mts. on the border between Iran and Turkmenistan (e.g., Christoph 1872, 1873, 1877, 1882, 1885, 1891) (Fig. 2).\n\nOtto Staudinger (*2.v.1830, Gross Wüstenfelde – †13.x.1900, Luzern) (Fig. 4g). One of the most famous German lepidopterists, Otto Staudinger found his passion for the world of insects through his tutor, WAGNER, at the young age of seven. Later he began studying medicine, but only after two semesters he shifted to zoology and wrote his dissertation on the taxonomy and systematics of the moth family Sesiidae (Staudinger 1854). He travelled around Europe and collected in most European countries, but also in the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa. He and his Danish son-in-law, Andreas Bang-Haas (1846–1925), built the largest private Lepidoptera collection of their time, in Dresden. Besides material from their own expeditions, they exchanged and bought many large Lepidoptera collections (e.g., Von Hopffer, Lederer, Herrich-Schäffer, Möschler, Kaden etc.). Altogether, Otto Staudinger described, in 137 publications, 3,932 new Lepidoptera at various taxonomic levels, mostly from the Palearctic Region. Among his valuable publications and detailed descriptions, two catalogues are worth noting: first, his “Catalog der Lepidopteren Europa's und der angrenzenden Länder” (Staudinger & Wocke 1861), published together with microlepidopterist friend Max Ferdinand Wocke and followed by a revised and expanded edition (Staudinger & Wocke 1871); second, his “Catalog der Lepidopteren des Palaearctischen Faunengebietes” (Staudinger & Rebel 1901), which he worked on extensively together with Hans Rebel, curator of Lepidoptera at the Natural History Museum of Vienna. Unfortunately, Staudinger never saw this second milestone's completion, as it was published a year after his death. His Palearctic catalogue significantly increased the number of known Lepidoptera at the time. Of the 9,500 or so species listed in the catalogue, only about 330 had “Persia” in their distribution, and these were mostly records from a small area in northern Iran at the eastern edge of the Alborz Mts. known as “Astarabad” (currently Gorgan). A small number of these species were also reported from southern Iran, e.g., “Farsistan” (Fars) and Baluchistan. Staudinger's vast collection of Lepidoptera was later sold to Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, whereas his duplicate Microlepidoptera collection was sold to Staatliches Tierkundemuseum Dresden. After Staudinger's death, his son-in-law Andreas Bang-Haas inherited a managerial role in their joint insect trading company, Staudinger & Bang-Haas, which was continued by Andreas's son, Otto Bang-Haas (1882–1948), until the end of his life (Draeseke 1992). Andreas Bang-Haas was also a lepidopterist, famous for his ability to identify Lepidoptera species correctly. Both Andreas and Otto published papers on the Lepidoptera fauna of Iran (A. Bang-Haas 1912; O. Bang-Haas 1927, 1937).\n\nNikolai Grigorievich Erschoff (*23.iv.1837, Moscow – †12.iii.1896, Saint Petersburg) (Fig. 4h). Russian lepidopterist Nikolai Erschoff came from a merchant family, taking on the family trade for some time early in his life. He was ultimately inspired by his teacher, Jean Édouard Ménétries, and became interested in Lepidoptera. Later, he joined the Russian Entomological Society and several other entomological societies, where he was influenced by well-known lepidopterists such as Sergei Nikolaevich Alphéraky, Otto Vasilievich Bremer and Nikolai Michailowitsch Romanov. His large collection, with over 10,000 specimens of Palearctic Microlepidoptera and over 21,000 butterflies, was later donated to the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Russia. Amongst his 30 or so publications is a paper on the rich fauna of Shahrud (Erschoff 1876), based on the material collected by Ogorodnikov.\n\nIII. From the end of World War II to the Islamic Revolution (1946 to 1979)\n\nBy the end of World War II, large parts of Europe and Asia were left in ruins. Many natural history collections and museums were not spared from the carnage of the war. In the aftermath, the world began anew, borders were redrawn, prisoners returned home and cities began to rebuild. During this time of renewal, lepidopterists likewise returned to work in their collections and museums. During the war, entomologists played a prominent role in identifying biodiversity and preventing the outbreak of pests and arthropod-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, typhus, tsutsugamushi fever). The high demand for basic entomological knowledge resulted in an increased number of scientific positions in departments of agriculture and public health and in the specialized entomological departments of army medical services (Gerberg 2008).\n\nMeanwhile, leaps in progress were made in taxonomy and systematics. An important concept that emerged during this period was that of populations as functional units of evolution, as suggested by Sir Julian Sorell Huxley (Huxley 1940), the English evolutionary biologist who played a central role in the “modern evolutionary synthesis”. During World War II, German evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr published his ground-breaking book titled “Systematics and the Origin of Species” (Mayr 1942), which was a distillation of species concepts and speciation processes in the context of the modern evolutionary synthesis. A few years later, German entomologist and phylogeneticist Willi Hennig published his “Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik” (Hennig 1950), where he described a practical and consistent method for tracing phylogenetic relationships based on morphological characters. This contribution, especially after its translation by D. Davis and R. Zangerl as “Phylogenetic Systematics” (Hennig 1965a), was a significant step towards a “more natural classification” of taxa. Soon thereafter, Watson & Crick (1953) described the double helix structure of DNA, promoting a genetic revolution in biology. These contributions to science, alongside others in the post-war era, directly influenced the mindset of Lepidoptera taxonomists, broadening their perspectives on alternative species concepts.\n\nAlthough Iran declared neutrality at the start of the war, the country was occupied in 1941 by Britain in the south and by the Soviet Union in the north. By 1942, an enormous influx of European refugees to Iran caused food shortages and extreme famine to spread across the country, leading to a high rate of mortality, political instability and social and economic suffering. However, the nature of Iran remained nearly untouched during the war, and its unsullied and little-known lepidopteran fauna became extremely attractive to budding lepidopterists in the 1960s and 1970s. This led to the undertaking of many expeditions in Iran from 1950 to 1979, when the Iranian Revolution overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Among the lepidopterists who focused on the fauna of Iran during this period, several prominent figures are discussed in the following section.\n\nJalal Afshar (*1894, Orumiyeh – †5.iii.1975, Tehran) (Fig. 5d). The influx of new European entomologists traveling to Iran during the post-war era coincided with the emergence of a first generation of Iranian entomologists. Much of this pioneering generation was trained in Europe or Russia and returned home to train its countrymen and establish a new breed of native lepidopterists. A well-known professor in entomology at Tehran University, Jalal Afshar, who completed his Ph.D. in Zoology at Shaniavsky University in Moscow before returning to Iran in 1920, was one such pioneer. Afshar recognized the lack of an insect reference collection in Iran, and in 1943 established a small collection in Tehran. This collection was later expanded by his students (e.g., Hayk Mirzayan, Ghodratollah Farahbakhsh), who also collected intensively in Iran and were prolific entomologists in their own right. Many Russian and European entomologists collaborated with the Iranians, further increasing the size and significance of the collection, which after the passing of Mirzayans was named the “Hayk Mirzayans Insect Collection” (abbreviated as HMIM). Alongside his publications on several other insect groups, Afshar published a catalogue of the butterflies of Iran in two parts (Afshar 1946, 1947). Soon after, many publications on the Lepidoptera of Iran by other Iranian entomologists (e.g., Davatchi 1958; Farahbakhsh 1961) started to appear, mostly with a focus on the biological traits of pest species.\n\nHans Georg Amsel (*20.x.1905, Bensberg – †20.x.1999, Langensteinbach) (Fig. 5e). A well-known German microlepidopterist, AMSEL was curator of the Lepidoptera collection and head of the entomology department at the State Museum of Natural History in Karlsruhe (SMNK). He played a fundamental role in research on various families of Microlepidoptera (mostly Gelechiidae, Tineidae, Momphidae, Crambidae, Pyralidae, Carposinidae and Oecophoridae) in Iran and neighbouring countries. After finishing his primary education, Amsel first worked as a bookseller and then trained as a bank clerk before giving up both career avenues to pursue biology and research on Lepidoptera, which he had been fascinated with since his youth. In 1933, he defended his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin on the zoogeographical-ecological-faunistic aspects of the lepidopteran fauna of Palestine (e.g., Amsel 1935). After finishing his studies, he worked for a few months as a volunteer in the Zoological Museum of Berlin before getting a position in 1934 as curator of the Overseas Museum in Bremen. Soon after the start of World War II, Amsel was called to the “Wehrmacht”. He held the rank of corporal until 1945, when he became a prisoner of war in Norway. After the war he moved to Buchenberg, a small village in the Black Forest, and worked as a mushroom specialist (Roesler 1975). In 1955, he became a curator and head of the entomology department at SMNK, where he worked until his retirement in 1973. Amsel's work led to the accumulation of a vast and scientifically significant Microlepidoptera collection at the Karlsruhe museum. Besides publishing 145 scientific papers on Lepidoptera, he is especially remembered for the magnificent book series “Microlepidoptera Palearctica”. This large project was initiated and edited by AMSEL together with František Gregor and Hans Reisser (and continued by Reinhard Gaedike). It was published in thirteen volumes between 1965 and 2008 and is still the most important reference for the study of several Palaearctic Microlepidoptera families. Besides his several expeditions to Palestine and Afghanistan in 1969, 1973 and 1975, Amsel travelled to Iran (Fig. 3) and collected large numbers of Lepidoptera, focusing primarily on Microlepidoptera. Additionally, he extensively examined the Iranian Microlepidoptera of other contemporary collectors (e.g., F. Brandt, E. P. Wiltshire & G. Ebert) and published the results in a series of papers (e.g., Amsel 1949, 1950, 1951, 1954, 1958, 1959, 1961a, 1961b, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978) providing a large overview of the Microlepidoptera fauna of Iran, with descriptions of several hundred species. However, many of the new genera and species described by Amsel were published outside of taxonomic revisions and have subsequently proved to be synonyms of previously described species (e.g., Sattler 1969).\n\nHans Zerny (*11.06.1887, Vienna – †17.09.1945, Vienna) (Fig. 5f). A highly influential Austrian lepidopterist and dipterist, Zerny completed his university studies and Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Vienna. Later in life he became curator of the Lepidoptera collection of the Natural History Museum of Vienna, where he worked until the end of his life. Among his about 40 publications, at least two important papers were dedicated to the fauna of northern Iran (Zerny 1939, 1940).\n\nEugen Wehrli (*17.iii.1871, Frauenfeld – †24.vi.1958, Münchenstein) (Fig. 5g). A Swiss medical doctor, Eugen Wehrli finished his studies in medicine in Zurich, Kiel, Genf and Basel, becoming a practicing ophthalmologist. Although he published his first paper on Lepidoptera in 1911 at the age of 40, he was fascinated with nature, especially butterflies and moths, since his childhood. In his twilight years he became a prominent lepidopterist, and from 1926 specialized on the family Geometridae (Sachtleben 1959). He expanded his collection from a local private one to an immense Palearctic collection supplemented with the largest and most complete Lepidoptera library in Switzerland. Wehrli became one of the main authors of the supplement to the fourth volume “Macrolepidoptera of the Earth” (“Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde”), edited by Adalbert Seitz (Wehrli 1939–1954). Henry Beuret (1958) described him as a sensitive person who was often conflict-averse, avoiding arguments surrounding research. A part of Wehrli's collection was donated to the Natural History Museum of Basel. However, his extraordinary collections of Palearctic Geometridae and Psychidae, including many type specimens of species described by him but also types of species described by Charles Oberthür, Achille Guenée and Jean Baptiste Alphonse Dechauffour de Boisduval, were deposited in the Zoological Research Museum “Alexander Koenig” in Bonn (ZFMK) four years before his death. Wehrli published several important papers on the geometrid moths of Iran (Wehrli 1938, 1939b, 1941) and described and recorded many more species from Iran in Seitz's series (Wehrli 1939–1954).\n\nWilli Richter (*2.ii.1895, Berlin – †1.ii.1966, Ludwigsburg) (Fig. 5h). A Berlin entomologist who trained as a preparator and worked for several years in the Zoological Museum of Berlin. During his early years, he collected insects in several European countries, Russia and the Transcaucasus. During World War II, Richter was sent to the frontline and found himself in an Anglo-American prison (Lindner 1966). After his release, he applied for a job at the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History (SMNS), where he was hired as chief preparator of insects. The Stuttgart museum, like many others during the war, was left in ruins. The old museum building in Ludwigsburg was bombed and destroyed, but its staff worked tirelessly, saving nearly all specimens and transferring them to safety. Richter had his work cut out, with most specimens needing to be sorted and remounted before transfer to the new museum buildings in Löwentor and Rosenstein Park in the 1950s. Richter was lucky enough to know Friedrich Schäuffele, a German who was working in Iranian Baluchestan as a medical doctor. Schäuffele organized two expeditions for Richter, in 1954 (Sistan-o-Baluchestan province) and 1956 (Khuzestan and Kerman provinces). Richter and Schäuffele collected large numbers of specimens from nearly all insect orders during these two expeditions (Fig. 3), which were prepared by Richter and were later made available to taxonomists around Europe. These two expeditions provided not only invaluable insect sampling from small and previously unexplored regions, but also led to the publication of a series of over 40 remarkable papers based on these materials, mostly in the two journals published by the SMNS, namely “Jahreshefte des Vereins für Vaterländische Naturkunde in Württemberg” and “Stuttgarter Beiträge zur Naturkunde”. Many new taxa and new records for Iran were published in these papers, e.g., on Orthoptera (Beier 1956, 1957; Bey-Bienko 1958; Chopard 1959), Coleoptera (Petrovitz 1958; Milos 1961; Scheerpeltz 1961), Diptera (Oldroyd 1958; Hennig 1965b), Trichoptera (Schmid 1959), Hemiptera (Wagner 1957; Jiri & Friedrich 1962), Neuroptera (HÖNzer 1968) and Lepidoptera (Amsel 1959, 1965; Toll 1959; Boursin 1960; Daniel 1960a) [for a complete list, see Richter & Schüz (1959)]. Most specimens from these two expeditions are now kept in the SMNS collections, but some are deposited in SMNK and other museum collections. Richter also published a travel report about each of his expeditions (Richter 1956, 1961). He was not only an entomologist but also a lover of nature who picked up all elements of the natural world with his sharpened senses and wrote about them extensively in his travel logs. His pet for many years was a Persian spiny-tailed lizard [Saara asmussi (Strauch, 1863)], which he brought back from Iran and kept alive and healthy for much longer than any zoo might have hoped to (Lindner 1966). He died from lung cancer just one day before his 71st birthday.\n\nCharles Boursin (*6.xii.1901, Nantes – †27.xii.1971, Paris) (Fig. 5i), a leading French lepidopterist and world-class specialist on trifid Noctuidae, was born in Nantes and raised bilingual in French and German. In 1920 at the age of 19, he moved to Paris and soon joined the Entomological Society of France as a volunteer, later joining the entomology department of the “Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle” as an assistant under the supervision of Louis Bouvier. Soon thereafter he began publishing scientific papers and taking part in international congresses, and in 1938 he joined the editorial board of the journal “L'Amateur de Papillons” (now “Alexanor”). His close friendship with German entomologists, especially during World War II, resulted in his dismissal as chair of entomology at the museum, followed by his expulsion from the Entomological Society of France in 1944. He moved to Vienna to work as a translator for the French Army, where he could again pursue his entomological research. After returning to Paris at the beginning of 1950, the French entomological community continued to shun him, but he carried on with his studies. Although he lived alone in a small room in a hotel until the end of his life, he never stopped his intense research on trifid Noctuidae, maintaining his international scientific collaborations. He described hundreds of new taxa in around 200 scientific papers and built a collection of 29,245 specimens (including 171 holotypes, 1,990 paratypes and 3,800 genital preparations) and 12,000 photos. Facing financial problems, he sold his collection to SMNK in Karlsruhe. Boursin died on December 26th, 1971 after an intracerebral haemorrhage. Günter Ebert (1974) described him as a quick and harsh person who often criticized others, which no doubt contributed to his lifelong exile from French entomological circles. Although he never travelled to Iran, he intensively studied the material collected there by others (e.g., Brandt, Ebert, Vartian) and published several important papers on the country's Noctuidae (e.g., Boursin 1937, 1942, 1943, 1947, 1948, 1950, 1952, 1955, 1960, 1963a, 1963b, 1963c, 1968, 1969, 1970).\n\nFriedrich Kasy (*25.ix.1920, Vienna – †4.ii.1990, Vienna) (Fig. 5j). An Austrian microlepidopterist, KASY was curator of the Lepidoptera collection at the Natural History Museum in Vienna. Although his passion lay in the natural sciences, his father pressured him into studying chemistry. World War II altered Kasy's life course as it did for many others. Soon after finishing high school he was sent to the frontline, where in 1945 he was arrested by the Russians in Hungary. At the end of 1947, two years after his capture, he finally returned to his homeland where he began his studies in zoology and botany at the University of Vienna, completing his Ph.D. a few years later. Kasy worked for the Austrian Forestry Service before becoming a curator in the Vienna Museum. Initially he was curator for Arachnoidea and Myriapoda, but by the 1960s he was given the curatorial position for the Lepidoptera collection. As an influential mentor, KASY trained several great lepidopterists, including Eva Vartian. He travelled to many countries in search of Lepidoptera, including several excursions (known as “Österreichische entomologische Iran-Expeditionen”) to Iran in 1963, 1965, 1970, 1972 and 1974, mostly with Eva and Asad Vartian (Fig. 3), during which he collected numerous specimens of Lepidoptera. In the long list of Kasy's publications, at least four papers exclusively reported on the Lepidoptera fauna (mainly Gelechioidea) of Iran (Kasy 1965, 1967, 1974, 1975). He left the description of new species belonging to families on which he was not a specialist to other taxonomists (e.g., POvolnÝ 1972; Sattler 1976).\n\nEva Vartian (*11.i.1925, Vienna – †14.v.2017, Vienna) (Fig. 5k). Austrian artist and lepidopterist Eva Vartian was born in a highly educated family in Vienna. Her father, Wilhelm Foltin, was a university professor in architecture and provided his daughter with a diverse and learned upbringing, instilling in her a love of nature and insects (Jovanovic-Kruspel et al. 2017). Eva studied fine arts at the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna and became an expert in fashion, textiles and painting. After World War II, at the age of 24, she met her future husband Asad Vartian, an Armenian carpet businessman who travelled frequently on business trips. In 1950, the Vartians joined the “Association of Austrian Entomologists” (“Arbeitsgemeinschaft Österreichischer Entomologen”). Soon after, they met and came under the mentorship of the Lepidoptera curator at the Natural History Museum in Vienna, Friedrich Kasy, who trained the Vartians on numerous lepidopterological techniques such as light trapping and specimen mounting. This new-found love of Lepidoptera and Kasy's guidance led to 22 expeditions by the couple to southern and eastern Europe over the next 26 years, and after the 1960s primarily to the Middle East and South Asia, where they were occasionally accompanied by Kasy. During these years, the Vartians travelled extensively through Iran thirteen times, covering most of the country between 1962 and 1975. Over the course of their lives they accrued one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths (with a focus on Macrolepidoptera) from the Middle East, including 140,000 pinned and outstandingly prepared specimens in 940 insect boxes. After Asad's death in 1982, Eva stopped her collecting activities and in 1995 deposited their vast collection in the Museum of Natural History in Vienna, in a separate room named after Eva Vartian herself. This exceptional collection was studied by many leading lepidopterists (e.g., C. Boursin, F. Daniel, G. Ebert, W. Forster, F. Kasy, C. M. Naumann, D. PovolnÝ, U. Roesler, E. P. Wiltshire, A. Vojnits, Z. Varga, L. and G. Ronkay), who designated 4,400 type specimens from it. The Vartian collection is one of the most important collections for the study of Iranian and Afghan Lepidoptera. A recently-published handbook series titled “Fibigeriana”, based on the Vartian collection, depicts species of various Lepidoptera families from West and Central Asia, with a special focus on the faunas of Iran and Afghanistan (e.g., Lödl et al. 2012, 2013, 2015).\n\nGünter Ebert (*29.iii.1935, Nürnberg) (Fig. 11d). Günter Ebert is undoubtedly the most important founder of modern lepidopterology in Iran. Ebert's love of insects started in his early childhood and was further fostered by several entomologists throughout his younger life, e.g.,Enslin, Konrad Gauckler, Herbet Menhofer and Erich Garthe, who frequently brought EBERT along on excursions. He later became a co-founder of the North Bavarian Entomological Working Group (“Entomologische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Nordbayern”). To escape the tedium of his office job, Ebert volunteered at the Publishing Society of North Bayern (“Nordbayerische Verlagsgesellschaft”), immersing himself in articles and research on insects (Trusch 2003). In 1957 he travelled for seven months in Afghanistan, a mystical new frontier for many European explorers that was uncharted territory for entomologists. Ebert collected highly valuable Afghan butterflies and moths that remain rare in collections to the present day. He returned to Afghanistan in 1961 for several months, then went on another expedition to Nepal in 1962. These early trips were a turning point for Ebert, and his lifelong dream of becoming a professional entomologist ultimately led him to quit his job as an office clerk in 1963. Soon thereafter he began working as a preparator for well-known microlepidopterist Hans Georg Amsel. He returned once again to Afghanistan and Iran in 1969 and 1970 and was invited by Hayk Mirzayans to the Plant Pests and Diseases Research Institute (PPDRI) (now Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection, IRIPP) in Tehran as a consultant on behalf of the Federal Office for Nutrition. He worked for roughly three years under the supervision of Mirzayans and established the Lepidoptera collection at IRIPP. During his tenure there, Ebert trained several entomologists (e.g., Ali Pazuki and Hushang Boroomand). Alongside his preparator Heinz Falkner, he carried out many trips throughout Iran (Fig. 3) and generated one of the best Lepidoptera collections from the country, now available at SMNK in Karlsruhe. Ebert'S time in Iran led to numerous publications on the faunas of Iran and Afghanistan, which garnered him not only a reputation for his knowledge of Middle Eastern Lepidoptera but also a position as curator at SMNK in 1973, an unprecedented achievement for a self-taught scientist (Trusch 2003). Until his retirement in 2002, Ebert worked as a curator, building a massive Lepidoptera collection and adding a large number of specimens from around the world. After his retirement, Ebert continued to work on the Lepidoptera collection of SMNK as a volunteer, with a special focus on the Noctuidae of Iran (Ebert & Hacker 2002). Ebert was the editor and coordinator of an extensive series titled “Die Schmetterlinge Baden-Württembergs”, in which he reviewed, alongside many fellow German lepidopterists, the entire Lepidoptera fauna of the State of Baden-Württemberg (SW Germany) across nearly 6,000 pages in ten volumes. In 2003, Ebert'S series was awarded the Fabricius Medal of the DGaaE (“Deutsche Gesellschaft für allgemeine und angewandte Entomologie”) at Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany, for his special achievements in basic entomological research. One year later, the book series was awarded the 7th Ernst-Jünger-Prize for Entomology in Baden-Württemberg, for outstanding scientific work in the field of entomology. During his expeditions to the Middle East and Central Asia, besides discovering and describing many new species from different families, Ebert collected well over 100,000 specimens, the largest special collection of Near-Eastern Lepidoptera in Germany. Ebert was also a co-founder of Societas Europaea Lepidopterologica (SEL) and, as secretary general, was a member of the society's board for ten years.\n\nHayk Mirzayans (*31.xii.1920, Qazvin – †2.iv.1999, Tehran) (Fig. 5l). Known as ‘MIRZA’ to his friends, Hayk Mirzayans was perhaps the most famous Iranian entomologist. Following his early interest in insects he studied entomology at the faculty of Agriculture in University of Tehran, graduating in 1945. Mirzayans was regarded as one of the most prominent students of Jalal Afshar, known as the father of modern entomology in Iran. Like many early Iranian entomologists he was also heavily influenced by several famous Russian colleagues (e.g., Alexandrov, Chovachin and Kiriokhin). Soon after completing his studies under Afshar, Mirzayans was hired as a research entomologist by the Ministry of Agriculture in Tehran, where he founded the Entomology and Plant Pathology Research Department (later renamed the Plant Pests and Diseases Research Institute). Mirzayans carried out several expeditions in Iran and visited every corner of the country, often travelling in dilapidated vehicles and even by pack animal. Although he mainly focused on Orthoptera, he never neglected other insect groups and collected a large number of insects from nearly all orders. Mirzayans, who was a talented polyglot, would often correspond with entomologists from other countries in their mother tongues (Armenian, Farsi, French, English, Russian), and built valuable scientific collaborations in the process. He invited several renowned entomologists of his time (e.g., Eugenio Morales Agacino, GÜNter Ebert, Hans Georg Amsel And Jean Barou) to Iran for joint field work and bilateral collaborations. These research stays were extremely helpful for the budding entomological sphere in Iran, and increased the size and scientific value of the insect collection at the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection in Tehran. For example, French entomologist Jean Barou published the first list of Iranian Lepidoptera based on this material (Barou 1967), whereas Günter Ebert reordered and updated the institute’s Lepidoptera collection during his time there. Together with other Iranian entomologists (e.g., Mansur Abai), Mirzayans played an essential role in founding the Entomological Society of Iran (ESI) in 1965 and was the editor of the “Journal of Entomological Society of Iran” (JESI) for many years. During his career, Mirzayans trained many young entomologists, including lepidopterists (e.g., Vazrick Nazari), discovering and publishing several new insect taxa for Iran. Among the many publications authored by Mirzayans, two constitute significant contributions to Iranian lepidopterology: Mirzayans & Kalali (1970), an update to the checklist published by Barou (1967), and Mirzayans & Abai (1974), a list of the oak-feeding Lepidoptera of the country. Although there were many misidentifications and typographical errors in these lists, both should be regarded as an important baseline for subsequent faunistic studies on Iranian Lepidoptera. One of the largest Iranian insect collections, located at the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection, is now named the “Hayk Mirzayans Insect Museum” (HMIM) in his honour.\n\nAli Asghar Ahmadi (*18.xii.1937, Lar – †11.i.1999, Shiraz) (Fig. 5m). A university professor at Shiraz University, Ahmadi was the first Iranian Lepidoptera specialist (Noctuidae). He obtained a degree in agricultural engineering from Shiraz University in 1961 and was then employed by the Department of Plant Protection, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, where he worked as a teaching coordinator and entomologist. In 1965, he moved to Stuttgart, Germany for a 10-month research stay at the Hohenheim College of Agriculture on a German scholarship. Upon returning to Iran he served as an instructor in the Department of Plant Protection, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University between 1966 and 1974, when he earned his master's degree in entomology. In 1974 he received a Ph.D. scholarship from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Iran, to study at the prestigious Cornell University in New York, USA. He published his Ph.D. thesis, titled “A revision and review of the North American species of Agrotis and Feltia known to occur north of the Mexican border (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae)”, in 1977. Soon after, he returned to Iran and worked as an academic staff member at Shiraz University until his sudden death on January 11th, 1999. During his life, Ahmadi trained many well-known entomologists in Iran (e.g., H. Al-Mansour, J. Hajizadeh, H. A. Lotfalizadeh, K. Minaee, M. Moghaddam, A. M. Sarafrazi).\n\nClas Michael Naumann (*26.vi.1939, Königsbrück – †15.ii.2004, Wachtberg-Pech, near Bonn) (Fig. 5n). Clas Naumann was born just two months before World War II in Königsbrück, north of Dresden, East Germany. In 1945, the war forced the Naumann family to give up all their properties in Saxony and move to Weserbergerland, North Germany. They subsequently moved again in 1949, to Wilhelmshaven, before finally relocating to Braunschweig in 1951. Influenced by his father, a Ph.D. in agriculture and hobbyist beetle collector, CLAS developed an early enthusiasm for nature and entomology. He was further influenced by Fritz Hartwieg, the editor of the “Braunschweig Lepidoptera Fauna” (“Die Schmetterlingsfauna des Landes Braunschweig”), who drew his attention to Lepidoptera. In 1959, he moved to University of Tübingen and first studied chemistry for three semesters on the advice of his father, who believed biology was an unprofitable field. However, in 1962, young Clas followed his passions and began his studies in biology. Soon he met Burchard Alberti, Karl-heinz Wiegel and Hugo Reiss, at that time leading Zygaenidae specialists and collectors in Germany. Naumann's interests in the phylogenetic systematics of Lepidoptera led him to Bonn, where he carried out his Ph.D. at ZFMK and in 1970 defended his thesis at Bonn University on the phylogeny of Palearctic Sesiidae. A partnership agreement in the early 1960s between the universities of Bonn, Cologne and Bochum and Kabul University in Afghanistan generated an opportunity for Naumann to take up a position as lecturer, between 1970 and 1973, in Kabul, where he also helped establish the university's zoological museum. Even before his tenure in Afghanistan, Naumann already had a fascination with classic 19th-century travel logs about Central Asia and Afghanistan. He quickly learned Farsi and fully immersed himself in Afghan culture during several expeditions that took him to the most remote areas of the country, in the Hindu Kush, in search of his favourite lepidopteran group, the burnet moths (Zygaenidae). From 1974 to 1977 he habilitated as a professor at Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich and began teaching at the University of Bielefeld, where he was head of the “Morphology and Systematics of Animals” department. In 1989 he returned to Bonn, as a professor at Bonn University and director of ZFMK, where he worked until the end of his life. From 1976 on and throughout his career, Naumann managed to go on at least one excursion every year, mostly to the Near East (e.g., Iran, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Tibet and the Caucasus), Southern Russia and Central Asia (Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan), but also to South Africa, Ethiopia and, finally, in 2002, back to his beloved Afghanistan (Wagner & HÄUser 2004). During these expeditions, Naumann accumulated a fantastic collection of Zygaenidae, discovering a dozen new species in the process. His lifelong passion for the faunas of Afghanistan and Iran doubtless cemented his legacy amongst lepidopterists in Iran and worldwide. Sadly, only six weeks before his retirement in 2004, Naumann passed away after a long battle with cancer (Wagner & HÄUser 2004). Upon his passing, his wife Storai donated his collection of burnet moths, consisting of over 130,000 specimens, to ZFMK. The second part of his collection, containing other moths and butterflies collected in Afghanistan, was donated to SMNK in Karlsruhe (Hofmann 2007).\n\nVI. Lepidopterists currently working on the fauna of Iran (2006 to now)\n\nOver the last 20 years (especially since the launch of A.L.I.), many European lepidopterists have travelled to Iran, either alone or in small groups, and published important works on the Iranian fauna. Some of these lepidopterists were invited directly by HMIM under the project “Insect fauna of Iran” or as a part of A.L.I. initiatives.\n\nDespite this influx of specialists, many Lepidoptera specimens at HMIM remain to be identified. As stated by Alipanah & Zahiri (2021: 45): “due to the weakness in study planning and the lack of an established structure in the field of identification and classification of Lepidoptera, as well as the large volume of samples sent from the research centres of other provinces for identification, many specimens remain unidentified”. Overcoming this taxonomic impediment was one of the original goals of A.L.I., by inviting specialists to HMIM, advising on species identification and improving the collection. Despite the end of A.L.I., global interest and work on Iranian Lepidoptera continues.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we briefly introduce the renowned living experts who are currently studying or actively collecting the Lepidoptera fauna of Iran. Specialists are ordered alphabetically by family name in the text, but according to the systematic order of their group(s) of interest in the plates and lepidopteran phylogenetic tree (Fig. 7), where additional specialists are also shown.\n\nHelen Alipanah finished her studies in zoology at Tehran University and wrote her master's thesis on the Formicidae (ant) fauna of Tehran and surrounding areas. In 2010, she defended her Ph.D. on the phylogenetic systematics of the tribe Oxyptilini (Pterophoridae) at the same university. She is now a Microlepidoptera specialist and the curator of Lepidoptera at HMIM since 2001. Alipanah is the author/co-author of over 40 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals and books on various Microlepidoptera families (e.g., Cossidae, Crambidae, Gracillariidae, Tischeriidae, Pterophoridae, Pyralidae, Tortricidae).\n\nJoaquín Baixeras (Fig. 8j). A professor of zoology at the University of Valencia, Spain, Baixeras is a well-known specialist on the family Tortricidae. His research focuses primarily on the evolution of sexual organs in Lepidoptera. Baixeras visited Iran in 2008, invited by the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection, and collected in northern Iran. He has focused on the Olethreutini of Iran and is also a co-author of the “Online World Catalogue of the Tortricidae” (Gilligan et al. 2018).\n\nGiorgio Baldizzone (Fig. 8m). A well-known Italian microlepidopterist and specialist on the family Coleophoridae, BALDIZZONE finished his Ph.D. in biological sciences in 1970 at the University of Turin. He is the author of over 200 scientific papers and has described over 350 new species of Coleophoridae from many parts of the world. He also published the “World Catalogue of Coleophoridae” together with Jean-François Landry and Hugo van der Wolf (Baldizzone et al. 2006).\n\nJarosław Buszko (Fig. 8d). An emeritus professor of entomology at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland, Buszko is one of the foremost experts on several lepidopteran families (e.g., Gracillariidae, Nepticulidae, Pterophoridae). He completed his Ph.D. in 1979 and became a professor in 2000 (Bunalski et al. 2001). His research mainly focuses on the taxonomy, zoogeography and ecology of Microlepidoptera. He is the primary author of many publications on Lepidoptera, including “The Lepidoptera of Poland: a distributional checklist” (Buszko & Nowacki 2000). BUSZKO has amassed a large collection including over 25,000 specimens belonging to several families.\n\nFrédéric Carbonell (Fig. 10a) is a French computer scientist who very early-on developed a passion for entomology. Parallel to his career as an engineer at IBM (expertise and consulting in improving software development processes), he has undertaken numerous entomological expeditions centred on the Middle East (Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon) and on the islands of the Indian Ocean (Mascarenes). Carbonell has made a name for himself as a specialist (biology, ecology, taxonomy) of certain groups of Papilionoidea: Lycaenidae (Polyommatinae, Polyommatus, Agrodiaetus), Nymphalidae (Satyrinae) and Papilionidae (Parnassiinae).

As an M.Sc. student at the University of Hohenheim, Germany, Wanke started his research on geometrid moths in 2018, revising the Middle Eastern and Central Asian faunas of the genus Triphosa Stephens, 1829 in Rajaei's lab at the State Natural History Museum of Stuttgart. After receiving his master's degree in 2019, he undertook a Ph.D. in the same lab on the taxonomy and phylogeny of Geometridae of the Middle East and Central Asia, with a special focus on Iran. Since his master's thesis he has published a series of important scientific papers on the geometrid fauna of Iran (e.g., Wanke et al. 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022; Wanke & Rajaei 2022).\n\nRoman V. Yakovlev (Fig. 8l). A professor of entomology at Altai State University in Russia, Yakolev is a global specialist on the family Cossidae. Yakovlev has discovered and described multiple Cossidae species from Iran. He is the main author of a recent monograph on the Cossidae of Iran (Alipanah et al. 2021).\n\nReza Zahiri (Fig. 11m). An Iranian-Canadian lepidopterist, Reza Zahiri is a specialist on Noctuoidea. After finishing his bachelor's and M.Sc. studies in Iran, he was the curator of the Lepidoptera collection at HMIM from 2004 to 2008. In 2008, he moved to Turku (Finland) to pursue his Ph.D. studies under the supervision of Niklas Wahlberg, successfully defending his Ph.D. thesis in June 2012. Focusing on multigene higher-level phylogenetics, he fundamentally changed the general understanding of relationships within Noctuoidea (Zahiri et al. 2011, 2013a, 2013b). After his Ph.D., Zahiri moved to Canada on a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Guelph (Biodiversity Institute of Ontario) in Paul Hebert's lab, where he assembled a DNA barcode library for 3,700 North American noctuoid species. Soon after, in 2015, he began a fellowship with the Canadian Government in Ottawa for the development of molecular keys to detect invasive species entering the country. In 2016, Zahiri was offered a job as lepidopterist at the Entomology Diagnostic Laboratory of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in Ottawa. Recently, in 2020, he spent a sabbatical as Lepidoptera curator at the Zoological Museum of Hamburg University. Zahiri is the author of over 50 peer-reviewed papers on Lepidoptera, mainly on the high-level phylogeny of global noctuoid moths.\n\nPayam Zehzad. Iranian Lepidopterist working on the taxonomy and biogeography of butterflies (Papilionoidea) of the Near and Middle East since 1996, especially on the genera Colias, Argynnis, Melanargia, Archon, Allancastria, Hypermnestra, as well as on the subgenus Achillides, of the Palearctic Realm. Payam Zehzad was a contributor to the book “Butterflies of Iran and Iraq” (Tshikolovets et al. 2014) and provided distributional data for some volumes of the “Guide to the Butterflies of the Palearctic Region”, edited by Gian Cristoforo Bozano.\n\nHans Christof Zeller (Fig. 8a). Austrian microlepidopterist specializing in basal Lepidoptera families, especially Micropterigidae. Zeller joined the second Austrian Zoological Expedition to the Alborz Mts. in 2003 and collected the first two (and still only known) species of Micropterigidae in Iran (Zeller & Rajaei, unpublished).\n\nIn addition to the above-listed taxonomists, several other specialists working on the West Palearctic Lepidoptera fauna are also authoritative on the fauna of Iran. These are: Leif Aarvik (Fig. 8i); A. Kun (Fig. 8o), B. Å. Bengtsson (Fig. 9a); O. Bidzilya (Fig. 9b); J. Tabell (Fig. 9j); D. Hobern (Fig. 9k); A. Volynkin (Fig. 9l); P. Sihvonen (Fig. 10l); W. Nässig (Fig. 10n); R. Rougerie (Fig. 10o); H. Hacker (Fig. 11g); U. Buchsbaum (Fig. 11l); and L. Rákosy (Fig. 11n)."
