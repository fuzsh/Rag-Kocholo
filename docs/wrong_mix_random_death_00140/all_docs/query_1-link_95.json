The photo of Seberg was manipulated to make it appear she was on a street in Tehran. The original photo was taken years before in the United States.\n\nTHE FACTS: Following the killing of Iran’s stop general Jan. 3, a flurry of social media posts began circulating to suggest the country was better before the 1979 revolution that led to the resignation of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the birth of the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn an effort to make the point, social media users shared photos purporting to show casually dressed women in Iran before 1979 and women in chadors, designed to cover a woman from head to foot to hide her shape, after the revolution..\n\nThe original image of Seberg, which was taken in 1959 by Italian photographer Willy Rizzo, shows Seberg sitting on a bike in the driveway of a white house in Hollywood.\n\nIn the altered image, Seberg was added into the foreground of a photo shot by photographer Roy Essoyan for The Associated Press. The caption of the AP photo says it shows a street scene of pedestrians threading their way through bumper-to-bumper traffic in 1970.\n\nThe altered photo of Seberg received thousands of likes on Twitter.\n\nThe photo of Seberg, who died in 1979, surfaced just as a movie about her life will soon be released in theaters where she will be played by Kristen Stewart. Seberg, who famously starred in Jean-Luc Goddard’s film “Breathless,” was known not only for her acting roles but also as an advocate for civil rights. Her activism later led her to be surveilled by the FBI. ___\n\nThis is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform."
