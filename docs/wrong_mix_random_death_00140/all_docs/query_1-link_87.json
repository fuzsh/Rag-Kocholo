        "text": "With many choosing to wear short skirts and colourful figure-hugging dresses, the women of Iran in the 1970s had the kind of freedoms that many in the West took for granted.\n\nStunning photos and magazine adverts from five decades ago reveal how women, as well as men, dressed freely and enjoyed displaying the fashions of the day.\n\nUnder the rule of King Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was an ally of Britain and the U.S., the hijab was even banned because it was argued it suppressed women.\n\nThe Shah's close relationship with the West had seen his government order equipment including 1,500 Chieftain tanks from Britain in a deal worth an estimated £650million.\n\nBut when the Shah was overthrown in the violent 1979 Iranian Revolution – and the hardline Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile – everything changed in the country.\n\nKhomeini enforced strict dress codes on men and women which killed off the country's burgeoning fashion scene.\n\nLaws that had protected women's rights were repealed, whilst strict punishment codes saw some publicly flogged for wearing lipstick.\n\nThe country's relationship with Britain and other Western nations was also plunged into crisis. Britain's tank deal was stopped in its tracks, after only 185 of the fighting machines had been delivered.\n\nThe near six-year imprisonment of British mother Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, who was finally released yesterday, was linked to Britain's ongoing failure to return the money paid by Iran for the remaining tanks.\n\nMs Ratcliffe was released by the current Iranian regime after Boris Johnson's Government repaid the outstanding £393.8million amount that was owed.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many women in Iran joined the work force and mixed freely with men.\n\nAt the time, actresses who were later banned from performing posed up in short skirts for magazines, while locals were photographed skiing and wearing swimsuits and Miss Iran contestants enjoyed paddle-boat outings.\n\nOther images from magazines show all-girl pop bands, an actress posing with her director husband, and advertisements showcasing Western fashion.\n\nThe women's rights movement in Iran blossomed after Reza Shah Pahlavi became king.\n\nAs well as banning the hijab, Pahlavi granted women the right to vote.\n\nThe Family Protection Act gave women greater rights such as allowing divorce and banning marriage under the age of 15.\n\nUnder the Shah, Iranians enjoyed the luxury of new colleges, universities and libraries. Secondary schools were free for all and financial support was extended to university students.\n\nThe Shah also pushed the country to adopt Western-oriented secular modernization, allowing some degree of cultural freedom\n\nHowever, there was also widespread censorship in the country and the Shah repressed political dissent.\n\nThe crackdown on communists and Islamists also led to many being imprisoned and tortured.\n\nWith his liberalising reforms and harsh treatment of his political opponents, the Shah made an enemy of traditionalists in the country.\n\nThese factors, along with the Shah being perceived as a puppet of the USA and economic uncertainty, culminated in the monarchy being overthrown in 1979.\n\nThe Shah, who was suffering from cancer, fled the country.\n\nAyatollah Khomeini, who had been living in exile in France, then returned and announced the creation of an Islamic republic.\n\nThe women's rights movement quickly regressed.\n\nWearing the hijab was enforced, many of the rights they had been granted were withdrawn and the female minister of education in Iran, Farokhroo Parsa, was executed by firing squad.\n\nUnder Khomeini's rule, Amnesty International estimated that the number of executions carried out in Iran was more than in the rest of the world combined.\n\nOne woman who was caught wearing lipstick in the northern city of Tabriz was said to have been flogged 101 times in the city's busiest area.\n\nIn the days that followed the revolution, students who backed Khomeini stormed the US Embassy in Tehran and took 66 of its staff hostage for 444 days.\n\nPopular anger against the US was rooted in the 1953 CIA-engineered coup that toppled Iran's elected prime minister and cemented the power of the Shah.\n\nAfter Khomeini's death in 1989, there was no let-up in the repression of Western lifestyles.\n\nNewspapers are censored, protests are aggressively suppressed and women have no legal protection against domestic violence or sexual harassment.\n\nIn June last year, the UN's investigator on human rights, Javaid Rehman, called for an inquiry into allegations that Khomeini's regime had ordered the executions of thousands of of political prisoners in 1988.\n\nThe country's new president, Ebrahim Raisi, is known as 'the butcher' for executing thousands of opposition prisoners in 1988 while serving as Tehran's deputy prosecutor and allegedly ordering pregnant women tortured.\n\nIt is estimated that between 4,000 and 30,000 people were condemned to death by then-supreme leader Ruhollah Khomeini in two separate waves, while Raisi was on a four-man 'death commission' that oversaw the executions\n\nMs Zaghari-Ratcliffe finally returned to Britain early this morning and was reunited with her husband Richard and seven-year-old daughter Gabriella.\n\nThe mother-of-one left Iran with fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, on Wednesday after their release was secured.\n\nMs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and of spying respectively, which they have consistently and vigorously denied.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain repaid its debt in a way that complies with the UK and international sanctions that are currently imposed on Iran.\n\nThe funds that have been released are said to be restricted to being used for humanitarian purposes only.\n\nThe hug that says 2,173 days of hell are OVER: Freed Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe embraces daughter Gabriella and tells delighted supporters 'You have made us whole' - minutes after landing back in the UK having been held captive in Iran since 2016\n\nBritish-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has landed at RAF Brize Norton after a six-year ordeal in Iran\n\nArrival comes as a result of a consistent and hard-fought campaign for release by family, friends, and activists\n\nMs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and fellow detainee Anousheh Ashoori landed in UK after journey from Tehran via Oman\n\nThere had been nervousness about situation, with the pair not considered free until they were on the plane\n\nBy Katie Feehan and Mark Duell for MailOnline\n\nBritish-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe broke down in tears as she was reunited with her seven-year-old daughter just minutes after landing back on British soil following almost six years of detention in Iran.\n\nThe charity worker embraced daughter Gabriella and husband Richard Ratcliffe, whose relentless campaigning since 2016 helped secure his wife's freedom, bringing a close to her momentous journey back home to the UK.\n\nThe mother-of-one left Iran with fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, on Wednesday after their release was secured.\n\nIn an emotional video shared by Mr Ashoori's daughter Elika, they can be seen tearfully hugging ecstatic family members only minutes after landing back in the UK.\n\nSeven-year-old Gabby shouted 'Mummy' before running to meet Nazanin who burst into tears as she entered the building before Richard joined them for a poignant reunion which lasted for more than an hour at the base.\n\nIn a message shared online, the Zaghari-Ratcliffe family said: 'No place like home. Thank you to everyone who made this possible, to all of the care and campaigning, and diplomatic efforts. You have made us whole.'\n\nIt is understood the families are being put up in Government-supported accommodation for the night.\n\nThe plane touched down at RAF Brize Norton at 1.08am following an eight-hour flight from Oman. Prior to that, the British nationals had boarded a flight from Tehran, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained six years ago.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori, who was locked up in Evin prison for almost five years, were accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and of spying respectively, which they have consistently and vigorously denied.\n\nA third British detainee, Morad Tahbaz, has been released from prison on furlough but remains in Iran.\n\nNazanin's husband Richard Ratcliffe said he was 'deeply grateful' for her release and that he and their daughter Gabriella were 'looking forward to a new life'. He said she had asked for him to make her a cup of tea on her arrival home.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, Mr Ratcliffe said: 'There will probably be a couple of days peace and quiet somewhere else, and then back here.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe departed the plane first, followed by Mr Ashoori, before the pair walked down the steps away from the aircraft together.\n\nThe British-Iranian mother waved at cameras as she walked into a reception building at the Oxfordshire airport, while Mr Ashoori, who was carrying a magazine, gave a salute.\n\nAfter finally leaving Tehran, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and fellow detainee Anousheh Ashoori arrived at Muscat in Oman at about 3.30pm UK time yesterday before travelling to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on a Titan Airways Boeing jet which was chartered privately by the UK Government.\n\nTheir release follows months of intensive diplomatic negotiations between London and Tehran, including the eventual payment of an outstanding £400 million debt owed by Britain to the regime.\n\nForeign secretary Liz Truss, who is at RAF Brize Norton for their arrival, said on Twitter: 'Delighted that Nazanin and Anoosheh have landed safely in the UK and are reunited with their families and loved ones. Welcome home.'\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori were initially taken to the Gulf state of Oman, which has been closely involved in the behind-the-scenes negotiations to secure their freedom.\n\n'The first thing she wanted was for me to make her a cup of tea, so we will do (that). I think actually we were looking at the house and it needs a bit of tidying, so there might be a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by mummy.'\n\nHe added that he had been 'kept out of' discussions about the debt the UK owed Iran, which Foreign Secretary Liz Truss confirmed had been settled.\n\nAsked by broadcasters about this, Mr Ratcliffe said: 'We have obviously been kept out of the loop on it and at various points I've said, 'look, listen, this is why she's being held, it is why it has gone on so long, and this is not our fight, please solve it'. And until this point we have been kept out of it.'\n\nHe told the Times Nazanin will begin spending her first day home 'learning how to be happy again', adding: 'There's no solace looking back at the time we have lost.'\n\nCharity worker Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 44, travelled to an airport in Tehran yesterday to come home to her family in the UK along with another detained British-Iranian, Anoosheh Ashouri, according to their lawyer Hojjat Kermani.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashouri were then handed over to a British team at Tehran's International Imam Khomeini Airport. A source close to their families later told the Reuters news agency that both had left Iran.\n\nLater, Badr Albusaidi, foreign minister for the Sultanate of Oman, tweeted a picture of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashouri after they landed in Muscat.\n\nHe said: 'Nazanin and Anoosheh have arrived safely in Oman. Sincere thanks for the hard work and good faith in Tehran and London that made this possible. Soon they will be with their loved ones at home. We hope this result will bring further progress in the dialogue between the parties.'\n\nThere had been much nervousness in Whitehall about the situation regarding Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe today despite her being freed, with sources stressing that she would not be considered free until she was actually on a plane.\n\nMr Ratcliffe, who lives in London, said the situation had been kept 'behind closed doors', adding: 'So I don't know what's happened, I've seen briefings and so on. I'm relieved the problem has been solved.\n\n'I think the Government has two jobs - to protect people in situations like this and to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n'Part of that is to do what you need to do to get people home and part of that is to ensure those who took her learn the lesson not to continue doing it - and that second part is for another day, but for today I'm really glad the way things are.'\n\nAsked what he wanted to say to people who had campaigned for his wife's release, Mr Ratcliffe said: 'Just 'thank you'. We wouldn't have got here, this wouldn't have happened today, without all the care and support of people up and down the country. That's ordinary people, people in the media, people in politics, some celebrities.\n\n'But just the overwhelming care we've had. And I remember saying this on the hunger strike - this has been a cruel experience in some ways, but it has also been an exposure to such a level of kindness and care from all walks of life.'\n\nHe said he was 'deeply grateful' to all who had worked to bring dual-nationals captured in Iran back to Britain.\n\nMr Ratcliffe described his wife as 'pretty agitated' in the run-up to getting on a plane out of Iran, but said the family was 'looking forward to a new life'.\n\nSpeaking about how she had been feeling, he said: 'Pretty agitated as the day went on. I mean, anxious - it has been bumpy.\n\n'There have been some scary conversations in the last couple of days as well, with people trying to make sure she would be well behaved when she came back.\n\n'There is a big grin on her face in that photo (on the plane). It is going to be lovely to see her, lovely to catch up with her. We've chosen which toys we're taking so that she can get to see them. We're looking forward to a new life.'\n\nAsked how the family planned to make up for six years apart, he said: 'There is a recovery process - you can't get back the time that is gone, that's a fact. But we live in the future and not the past, so we'll take it one day at a time.'\n\nAnd asked if a hug would 'make all this hardship worthwhile', he said: 'I'm not sure it was all worthwhile. I think it is going to be the beginning of a new life, a normal life, and hopefully a happy family.\n\n'And there will be bumps, no doubt, and all the normal squabbles we had before but, yeah, I think we're really looking forward to seeing her.'\n\nMr Ratcliffe said: 'Homecoming is a journey, not an arrival. I don't think it will just be today, there will be a whole process, and hopefully we'll look back in years to come and just be a normal family and this will be a chapter in our lives, but there are many more chapters to come.'\n\nHe also expressed thanks for the help given by UK Government and Foreign Office officials, along with 'ministers at different points', and MPs, during the campaign to bring Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe back to Britain.\n\nHe added: 'It has been a tough journey for all of us for lots of different reasons and I'm really grateful for the grace, patience and stoicism that they have shown to get Nazanin home.'\n\nMr Ashoori was arrested in August 2017 while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran while Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained on security charges by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at Imam Khomeini airport after a holiday visit to Iran, where she introduced her daughter Gabriella to her parents.\n\nHer family's Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who has long campaigned for her release, tweeted a picture earlier today of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on a plane officially leaving Iran and said: 'It's been six long years - and I can't believe I can finally share this photo.\n\n'Nazanin is now in the air flying away from six years of hell in Iran. My heart goes out to Gabriella [her daughter] and Richard [her husband], as her long journey back home to them gets closer by the minute. #NazaninIsFree.'\n\nCharity group REDRESS, which supports torture survivors and has campaigned for Nazanin's release since 2016, said they were relieved she was on her way home.\n\nRupert Skilbeck, Director at REDRESS said: 'We are incredibly relieved that Nazanin will finally be reunited with her family in the UK after a horrific six-year ordeal. Nazanin has endured unimaginable suffering.\n\n'Richard fought day and night for his wife to be allowed to return to the UK and REDRESS is honoured to have supported them in securing Nazanin's freedom.\n\n'Nazanin's detention in Iran was always illegal and her treatment by Iran amounted to torture. In celebrating her release, we must not forget the deep and continuing injustice perpetrated by Iran.\n\n'Iran's systematic practice of holding foreign nationals hostage for diplomatic leverage cannot be allowed to continue.'\n\nThe family of Anoosheh Ashoori said they were 'delighted' he had been released, adding: 'This day has been a long time coming, and we are thankful for the efforts of everyone involved in bringing Anoosheh home.\n\n'1,672 days ago our family's foundations were rocked when our father and husband was unjustly detained and taken away from us. Now, we can look forward to rebuilding those same foundations with our cornerstone back in place.'\n\nA third dual national, Morad Tahbaz, was released from jail on furlough.\n\nThe UK agreed to pay £393.8million owed to Iran after it cancelled an order of Chieftain tanks following the overthrow of the Shah in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMs Truss tweeted today: 'I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori will return to the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough. They will be reunited with their families later today. We will continue to work to secure Morad's departure from Iran.'\n\nMs Truss insisted that the UK settled the outstanding debt with Iran in a way which complies with UK and international sanctions, with the funds that have been released being restricted to humanitarian purposes only.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter today: 'The release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, and the furlough of Morad Tahbaz are huge achievements for British diplomacy.\n\n'I pay tribute to the tireless efforts of those who have worked for six years to make today's events possible.\n\nFormer foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he felt 'quite choked up' about the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori as he admitted the situation had taken 'too long' to resolve.\n\nSpeaking on Times Radio, he said: 'I wasn't sure I'd ever see the day when we'd see on our TV screens that Nazanin, Anoosheh, are coming home. Their families are amazing and I, you know, sometimes I despaired.\n\n'But, you know, lots and lots of people worked really hard to make this happen. I think Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin's husband, is one of the bravest people I've ever met and he kept the issue in the public eye.\n\n'So look, I think it took too long. But I think that the reality is that we have now solved this issue and that is something to celebrate.'\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron said the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was 'a piece of good news that we've all been waiting to hear for so long'.\n\nMr Cameron, who was in No 10 when Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran, told Channel 4 News: 'You can just only imagine what it'd be like to be separated from your family for so long, and have so much heartache, and you just feel for this family getting back together again and wish them well.\n\n'It's fantastic news.'\n\nMother-of-one Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had her British passport returned over the weekend, and Mr Kermani said she and Mr Ashoori were both taken to Tehran Airport today. The Iranian judiciary confirmed both had been released.\n\nOn Mr Ashoori, a retired engineer from South East London who had been sentenced to ten years in jail in Iran on charges of spying for Israel, judiciary spokesman Zabihollah Khodayian said: 'Due to his age and physical condition, the court agreed to his conditional release and he was... freed.'\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran Airport in April 2016 and later convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment.\n\nHer family - including husband Richard, who has led a campaign to free her for years - and the foundation deny the charge.\n\nShe had been held under house arrest and unable to leave the country after her release from prison.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who served most of her first sentence in Tehran's Evin prison, was released from jail in March 2020 during the pandemic and then kept under house arrest at her parents' home in Tehran.\n\nIn March 2021, she was released from house arrest but she was summoned to court again on a new charge.\n\nIn April 2021, she was then sentenced to a new term in jail on charges of propaganda against Iran's ruling system, charges she denies.\n\nBut that sentence has not yet started and she was technically banned from leaving Iran.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sister-in-law said it is a 'day of joy' for the family. Rebecca Ratcliffe told Sky News: 'It is a bit overwhelming, to be honest.\n\n'Six years of campaigning solidly, always hoping for that day to come and never really quite realising when it is going to come, and suddenly ... she's finally on that plane and coming home. It is a real day of joy for us.'\n\nShe said the couple's seven-year-old daughter Gabriella was looking forward to finally being reunited with her mother.\n\n'She knew yesterday that mummy had had her passport back and hopefully that mummy would come back very soon.\n\n'But of course Gabriella has been told quite a few times before mummy is going to come back home, so I suspect Gabriella won't quite believe it.\n\n'But tonight will be quite an emotional scene for Gabriella and Richard when they are finally reunited and she gets to hug her mummy and actually gets her mummy to kiss her goodnight, which is what she's wanted for a long time now.'\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release comes after the semi-official Fars news agency suggested she would be released as the British government had paid Iran about £400million.\n\nBefore the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the late Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi paid the sum for Chieftain tanks that were never delivered.\n\nThe Foreign Office has not commented on the reports of her release, and Boris Johnson had said negotiations about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe were 'moving forward' but 'going right up to the wire'.\n\nThe Prime Minister had confirmed earlier during a visit to the Middle East that a negotiating team has been at work in Tehran to free Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who holds dual UK-Iranian citizenship.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 as she prepared to fly back to the UK, having taken her daughter Gabriella - then not even two years old - to see relatives.\n\nShe was accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and sentenced to five years in jail, spending four years in Tehran's Evin Prison and one under house arrest.\n\nBoth the British Government and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have always denied the allegations.\n\nWhile details of the negotiations remain unclear, it is possible they are linked to a £400million debt dating back to the 1970s owned to Iran by the UK.\n\nThe Government accepts it should pay the 'legitimate debt' for an order of 1,500 Chieftain tanks that was not fulfilled after the shah was deposed and replace by a revolutionary regime.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss told Sky News today that it is a 'priority to pay the debt that we owe to Iran'. Tehran remains under strict sanctions, however, which have been linked to the failure to clear the debt.\n\nWhile the British and Iranian governments have said there is no connection between the debt and the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Iranian state media last year reported unidentified Iranian officials saying she would be freed once the debt was paid.\n\nIranian officials did not comment when asked whether the amount has been paid by Britain as reported by some Iranian outlets.\n\nMs Truss said: 'I'm delighted that Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad have all been released by the Iranians, and that Nazanin and Anoosheh will return back home to the UK.'\n\nSpeaking at the Foreign Office, she told reporters: 'We have been working hard over the last six months to ensure that we were able to secure the release of these detainees - Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad - and make sure that they are able to - this is happening for Nazanin and Anoosheh - make sure they're able to return back to the UK.\n\n'I just want to say my sympathies are with the families for what they've suffered over this appalling time and I'm delighted to be welcoming them back to the UK later today.'\n\nShe also said that said the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mr Ashoori, along with environmental activist Mr Tahbaz on furlough, was the result of 'creative British diplomacy'.\n\nIn a statement, she said: 'After years of detention by the Government of Iran, British nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori will return from Iran today.\n\n'Morad Tahbaz has also been released from prison on furlough. It is the result of tenacious and creative British diplomacy.\n\n'Nazanin has been held in Iran for almost six years, and Anoosheh almost five. Morad has been in prison for four. They will be reunited with their families and loved ones.\n\n'Their release is the result of years of hard work and dedication by our brilliant diplomats, and intensive efforts over the past six months.\n\n'I pay tribute to my predecessors and the Prime Minister, who have all worked hard to resolve this issue.\n\n'We have the deepest admiration for the resolve, courage and determination Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad, and their families, have shown.\n\n'They have faced hardship that no family should ever experience and this is a moment of great relief.'\n\nMs Truss confirmed the UK has settled the £400 million debt relating to an order of Chieftain tanks cancelled following the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in the revolution of 1979.\n\nMs Truss said: 'In parallel, we have also settled the IMS debt, as we said we would.\n\n'I made resolving the continued detention of British nationals and the IMS debt payment my top priorities when I entered office in September 2021.\n\n'In my first week, I spoke to the families of all the detainees and met my Iranian counterpart in New York.\n\n'Last October and November I dispatched a team of Foreign Office negotiators to Tehran to secure the release of the detainees.\n\n'Last December I met Omani foreign minister Badr to secure Oman's diplomatic assistance.\n\n'We are grateful to our friends in Oman for their support in securing the return of our nationals.\n\n'Last month I spoke twice to Iranian foreign minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion.\n\n'Our officials then held a last round of negotiations to sign off an agreement allowing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori to return to the UK, and Morad Tahbaz to be released on furlough to his house in Tehran.\n\n'The IMS debt has been settled in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. These funds will be ring-fenced solely for the purchase of humanitarian goods.'\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said he had authorised the release of the funds to settle the debt.\n\nIn a written Commons statement, he said: 'On Thursday 10th March 2022 I authorised the release of £393.8 million to discharge the debt owed by the Ministry of Defence-owned company, International Military Services Limited (IMS).\n\n'The debt resulted from contracts which were signed between IMS Ltd and the pre-revolution Iranian government.\n\n'Following the Iranian revolution, the contracts were not fulfilled, despite pre-payments made by Iran to the UK. The UK courts and the International Court of Arbitration (ICC) subsequently confirmed that the debt was still owed to the Iranian government.\n\n'The payment of the debt reflects the UK Government's determination to meet that international obligation, while seeking to ensure that such funds can only be used in accordance with applicable sanctions, and domestic counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering legislation, for example to purchase humanitarian goods.\n\n'I have been a consistent campaigner on IMS settlement, including as Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Iran and securing a Westminster Hall debate in March 2014 in which I called to 'honour the debt once and for all'.\n\nMonique Villa, the former chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was previously an employee, said friends and family had been reluctant to confirm she was on the verge of release in case there was a last-minute 'trick'.\n\nMs Villa, who said she speaks often virtually with Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her husband Richard, said: 'Until the last moment, you never know.\n\n'It has happened a few times that we really thought she would be back home, and then it never happened, so you become very cautious.\n\n'The fact that she got the passport yesterday was absolutely crucial.\n\n'And the chief negotiator of the Foreign Office was in Tehran negotiating, so we knew it was probably close - but you never know, because there can always be a trick or something.'\n\nAntonio Zappulla, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was previously employed, said staff were 'overjoyed' at news of her release.\n\nIn a statement, he said: 'On behalf of all at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, we are overjoyed that our much missed colleague and friend Nazanin has finally been freed.\n\n'No one can begin to imagine what Nazanin has endured throughout the past tortuous six years; denied her freedoms, separated from her husband and young child, battling significant illness, thrown in solitary confinement.\n\n'An innocent victim of an international dispute, Nazanin has been one of many used as political pawns. Her treatment has been utterly inhumane.\n\n'Throughout this extremely dark period, we have supported the Free Nazanin campaign every single step of the way, whilst remaining in close contact with Richard, and of course, with Nazanin herself.'\n\nMr Zappulla added: 'On a personal level, I have nothing but admiration for Nazanin's courage, resilience and fortitude, despite her prolonged and painful suffering.\n\n'I have been thankful that we have been able to remain in close contact. She is a truly remarkable woman, with a truly remarkable family.\n\n'In a time when the world is in turmoil and the news has been consistently bleak, Nazanin's freedom is a ray of light and hope. Her reunion with her family cannot come soon enough, and we cannot wait to have her back with us at the Thomson Reuters Foundation whenever she is ready.\n\n'Our thoughts are with all those who remain unfairly incarcerated in Tehran, and with their families who continue to so desperately hope for clemency.'\n\nAlso today, a lawyer who has worked with the family of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she will not 'be certain' until the plane carrying the mother takes off.\n\nPenny Madden QC said: 'Well I think we all feel just enormous relief.\n\n'We now know that she is on her way home, she's on the plane. We haven't had confirmation that the plane has actually taken off, but it certainly won't be long.\n\n'So enormous relief, it's been an absolute roller-coaster for the family over the last few days, huge excitement, huge optimism tempered with real anxiety that it felt so close, but one could never be certain until actually that plane takes off.\n\n'The family felt just huge excitement and and enormous relief, it's been six very, very long years.\n\n'I think that's probably case closed in terms of, not only is Nazanin coming home, but we understand that Anoosheh Ashoori is also coming home and that's also fantastic news.'\n\nBut shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK Government needed to 'learn its own lessons' following the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, accusing 'Boris Johnson's bungling diplomacy' of making the situation worse for her at times while detained in Iran.\n\nThe Labour MP said: 'The release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori is wonderful news that is long overdue.\n\n'It is shameful that for years the Iranian government used the freedom of British nationals as political bargaining chips.\n\n'The British government must learn its own lessons over how Boris Johnson's bungling diplomacy at times made the situation worse.\n\n'We pay tribute to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Anoosheh Ashoori, and their families who showed extraordinary strength and courage in the face of an unimaginable ordeal.\n\n'Now they finally have the freedom they deserve.'\n\nFollowing the news that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on her way home to the UK from Iran, Sir Keir Starmer said: 'For Nazanin, for Richard, and their daughter, this is an incredible moment after so much anguish.'\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Huddersfield, the Labour leader said: 'The courage that they have shown over so many years, I've met Richard many times - I know, I can feel what this will mean for him, for Nazanin, for their daughter and their family.\n\n'My emotion, I think, will be the emotion of families across the whole of the country which is just so pleased for them.\n\n'There will be questions of course, for other people to answer, but at the moment but at the moment, I'm so pleased for them as a family that this incredible moment appears to have come about and I think the British public - all of us - will just be wishing them all the very best after the unimaginable ordeal that they've been through.'\n\nSir Keir added: 'Complex, difficult negotiations, lots of questions to be answered about what happened along the way, but at this moment, all of my thoughts are with the family in this emotional reuniting after so many long, unimaginable what they've been through.\n\n'I'm just imagining how they'll be feeling, being able to reunite as a family and I'm so delighted for them.'\n\nLabour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: 'I'm delighted to hear that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on her way home to be reunited with her family.\n\n'Nazanin and her loved ones have shown great courage, strength and steadfastness through this unimaginably difficult time. London looks forward to welcoming her home.'\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been supported by celebrities including TV presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, who has been a vocal advocate for her release.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, the writer, 49, said: 'All I want to say is that this is an inspirational family: the heroic Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin and Gabriella, and their wider family in England, Wales and Iran, have a strength and bravery that is beyond words.\n\n'They are showing the world the power of hope, faith and effort. Also Tulip Siddiq has been a phenomenal constituency MP. God bless all of them.'\n\nCoren Mitchell and Claudia Winkleman visited the husband of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on day nine of hunger strike outside the Foreign Office in London which he started after his wife lost her latest appeal in Iran.\n\nRights groups accuse Iran of holding dual-nationals as bargaining chips for money or influence in negotiations with the West, something Tehran denies.\n\nIran does not recognise dual nationalities, so detainees like Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe cannot receive consular assistance.\n\nA United Nations panel has criticised what it describes as 'an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals' in Iran.\n\nSacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive, said: 'This is fantastic news, but it hasn't come a moment too soon.\n\n'Nazanin and Anoosheh should never have been detained in the first place - they were both jailed on trumped-up national security charges, a familiar tactic in Iran.\n\n'Nazanin and Anoosheh have unquestionably been used as political pawns by the Iranian authorities - and the Iranian authorities have acted with calculated cruelty, seeking to wring the maximum diplomatic value out of their captivity.\n\n'The Government needs to follow up on Nazanin and Anoosheh's release by immediately renewing its calls for the release of the UK nationals Mehran Raoof and Morad Tahbaz, both of whom are still going through an ordeal all too similar to Nazanin and Anoosheh's.\n\n'It's been clear for years that the Iranian authorities are targeting foreign nationals with spurious national security-related charges to exert diplomatic pressure, and it's more important than ever that Britain works multilaterally to combat this insidious practice.'\n\nMorad Tahbaz, an Iranian-American who also holds British nationality, was arrested alongside other environmentalists in January 2018 and sentenced to 10 years in jail for 'conspiring with America'.\n\nDual nationals from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden and the United States have also been arrested in similar circumstances.\n\nRedress, an anti-torture group which has campaigned for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be freed, said it congratulated the UK Government on 'finally negotiating her release'.\n\nDirector Rupert Skilbeck said: 'We are incredibly relieved that Nazanin will finally be reunited with her family in the UK after a horrific six-year ordeal. Nazanin has endured unimaginable suffering.\n\n'Richard (Ratcliffe) fought day and night for his wife to be allowed to return to the UK and Redress is honoured to have supported them in securing Nazanin's freedom. Nazanin's detention in Iran was always illegal and her treatment by Iran amounted to torture.\n\n'In celebrating her release, we must not forget the deep and continuing injustice perpetrated by Iran. Iran's systematic practice of holding foreign nationals hostage for diplomatic leverage cannot be allowed to continue.'"
