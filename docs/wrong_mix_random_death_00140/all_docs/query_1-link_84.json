Travel of Princess Soraya in the United States\n\n155. Empress Soraya, the second wife of the last Shah of Iran, died in Paris at the age of 69. . One of the most glamorous women of her day, she became Empress of Iran aged just 16, but was repudiated by her husband seven years later because she was unable to bear him an heir to the peacock throne.\n\n163. Born in Isfahan, Iran, Soraya Esfandiary was the eldest child and only daughter of Khalil Esfandiary—a noble of the Bakhtiari tribe of southern Iran who was the Iranian ambassador to West Germany in the 1950s—and his Russian-born German wife, Eva Karl. She had one sibling, a younger brother, Bijan. Her family had long been involved in the Iranian government and diplomatic corps. An uncle, Sardar Assad, was a leader in the Iranian constitutional movement of the early 20th century.\n\n164. Soraya Esfandiari-Bakhtiari was born in Iran on June 22, 1932, to an Iranian businessman and his German wife. She moved to Berlin when she was only eight months old. She had a nomadic childhood as her family settled in many different countries, from Iran to Switzerland, where she studied in a boarding school at Montreux.\n\n166.

Princess Soraya became Empress of Iran when she was barely 16, but was repudiated by her husband seven years later for not being able to bear him an heir to the peacock throne.\n\n183. Though her father hoped she would secure herself a well-to- do husband at an early age, yet Soraya had other plans. She persuaded him to let her live in London when she was just 16, where she was befriended by the Shah’s sister, Princess Chams. When the newly-divorced Iranian ruler saw a picture of the dark-haired, emerald-eyed teenager, he was smitten. After their first meeting he asked her father Khalil for Soraya’s hand in marriage.\n\n186. The bride wore a beautifully crafted wedding dress by Christian Dior consisting of 37 yards of silver lace with 20,000 feathers and 6,000 diamond pieces sewn on.\n\n188. The ceremony was decorated with 1.5 tonnes of orchids, tulips, and carnations, sent by plane from the Netherlands, and entertainment included an equestrian circus sent from Rome. The bride wore a silver lamé gown studded with pearls and trimmed with marabou stork feathers, designed for the occasion by Christian Dior. She also wore a full- length female white-mink cape.\n\n192. Soraya married the Shah at Marble Palace, Tehran, on 12 February 1951\n\n200.

Soon after her marriage with Shah, Queen Soraya busied herself with renovating and fixing up their residential palaces and attending to charity organizations formed under her patronage. \"Queen Soraya Pahlavi Charity\" was the principal charity of her patronage, which was formed and managed efficiently by Forough Zafar.\n\n205.

Alam (second from left) with Queen Soraya Esfandiari\n\n214. When she was 20, her husband started forcing her to produce an heir to the throne, but Soraya was unable to have children. As per the Persian constitution, if the Shah had no issue, then the royal line would end. Soraya left Iran, on the seventh anniversary of her fairy-tale marriage. A month later, the Shah divorced her.\n\n216. One day in July 1957 the couple went for a long walk in the Palace grounds. The Shah talked about the dynasty's survival and brought up the heir issue and the fact that they would soon have to make a decision no matter how painful. They talked about alternatives like the Shah taking a second wife and perhaps changing the constitution to allow one of his half brothers to become king after him. They couldn't agree on any of these alternatives and found each one unacceptable. They finally decided with tears in their eyes and with very heavy hearts, to separate. Before departure for Europe, Soraya burnt all her personal papers; packed her souvenirs and gifts she had received, and left Tehran on the 14th of February 1958 never to see her beloved country again.\n\n217. On 21 March 1958, the Iranian New Year's Day, a weeping Shah announced his divorce to the Iranian people in a speech that was broadcast on radio and television; he said that he would not remarry in haste. The headline-making divorce inspired French songwriter Françoise Mallet-Jorris to write a hit pop song, Je veux pleurer comme Soraya (I Want to Cry Like Soraya). The marriage was officially ended on 6 April 1958.\n\n218. Though the wedding took place during a heavy snow, deemed a good omen, the imperial couple's marriage had disintegrated by early 1958 owing to Soraya's apparent infertility, for which she had sought treatment in Switzerland and France, and the Shah's suggestion that he take a second wife in order to produce an heir. She left Iran in February and eventually went to her parents' home in Cologne, Germany, where the Shah sent his wife's uncle, Senator Sardar Assad Bakhtiari in early March, 1958, in a failed attempt to convince her to return to Iran. On 10 March, a council of advisers met with the Shah to discuss the situation of the troubled marriage and the lack of an heir. Four days later, it was announced that the imperial couple would divorce. It was, the 25-year-old queen said, \"a sacrifice of my own happiness.\"She later told reporters that her husband had no choice but to divorce her.\n\n219. In a statement issued to the Iranian people from her parents' home in Germany, Soraya said, \"Since His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi has deemed it necessary that a successor to the throne must be of direct descent in the male line from generation to generation to generation, I will with my deepest regret in the interest of the future of the State and of the welfare of the people in accordance with the desire of His Majesty the Emperor sacrifice my own happiness, and I will declare my consent to a separation from His Imperial Majesty.\"\n\n220. The Shah and Soraya divorced on the 14th March 1958 after 7 years of marriage. They had already said their sad tearful good byes in private. Their love for one another remained until the end. Soraya began her grief in private and in dignity like a true Bakhtiari.\n\n221. After the divorce, the Shah, who had told a reporter who asked about his feelings for the former Queen that \"nobody can carry a torch longer than me\", indicated his interest in marrying Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy, a daughter of the deposed Italian king Umberto II. In an editorial about the rumors surrounding the marriage of \"a Muslim sovereign and a Catholic princess\", the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, considered the match \"a grave danger.\"\n\n222. Upon the divorce, Soraya ceased being a queen, but a day later she was granted the personal style and title Her Imperial Highness Princess Soraya of Iran.\n\n223. The period of sadness and aimless life seemed to have no end for her. Now alone and without any aids or protection of the Imperial court, she had to do everything herself, and even harder still was that she now had to learn how to live the life of an ordinary citizen again. She was alone, frightened, and uncertain of her future. Her only security and comfort was in her immediate family. She began traveling extensively.\n\n224. She was allured by the movie industry as it had always been her dream to one day become a movie star. She met Dino de Laurentis at a party one evening in Rome. Dino offered her a role in a movie he was making. Soraya readily accepted. The movie's title was \"Three faces of a woman\" and Mauro Bolognini, Michelangelo Antonioni and Franco Indovina directed it. The movie was a disaster. The rumor has it that when the Shah heard that Soraya was to appear in a movie, he was so infuriated that the whole world would now see his ex-wife in romantic scenes that he ordered all the copies be bought and destroyed. Soraya kept one copy, which was eventually sold at the auction of her estate in Paris in May of 2002 together with all her personal effects.\n\n225. CAREER AS AN ACTRESS Having granted the royal title Princess of Iran soon after her divorce, she moved to France. Princess Soraya launched a brief career as a film actress, for which she used only her first name. Initially, it was announced that she would portray Catherine the Great in a movie about the Russian empress by Dino De Laurentiis , but that project fell through. Instead, she starred in the 1965 movie I tre volti (The Three Faces)and became the companion of its Italian director, Franco Indovina (1932–72). She also appeared as a character named Soraya in the 1965 movie She. After Indovina's death in a plane crash, she spent the remainder of her life in Europe, succumbing to depression, which she outlined in her 1991 memoir, Le Palais Des Solitudes (The Palace of Loneliness).\n\n226.

The first, published in 1964 and published in the United States by Doubleday, wasPrincess Soraya: Autobiography of Her Imperial Highness. A decade before her death, she and a collaborator, Louis Valentin, wrote another memoir in French, Le Palais des Solitudes (Paris: France Loisirs/Michel Laffon, 1991), which was translated into English as Palace of Solitude (London: Quartet Books Ltd, 1992); ISBN 0-7043-7020-4.\n\n235. LEGACY Soraya's divorce from the Shah inspired French songwriter Francoise Mallet-Jorris to write \"Je veux pleurer comme Soraya“ (I Want to Cry Like Soraya). The French rose grower, François Meilland, bred a sunflower in the former queen's honor, which he called Empress Soraya. An Italian/German television movie about the princess's life, Soraya (a.k.a. Sad Princess) was broadcast in 2003, starring Anna Valle (Miss Italy 1995) as Soraya and Erol Sander as the Shah. French actress Mathilda May appeared as the Shah's sister, Princess Shams Pahlavi.\n\n237.

IN EXILE IN ROME She became restless and during the summer months when Rome became too hot, she traveled to Northern Europe and stayed in Cologne for a while with her mother with whom she felt secure.\n\n257.

In the European society, she took precedence over many members of the highest nobility. She enjoyed the diplomatic passport and the privileges that came with it until the 1979 Iranian revolution when King Hassan of Morocco ordered that a Moroccan diplomatic passport be issued to her. Eventually, she became a German citizen just a few years before her death.\n\n263. With her brother Bijan in later years Soraya continued her life in Paris and spent her summers at her Villa Maryam (named after her grandmother) in Marbella, Spain. She led a high social life and spent her time with a select few friends. The sad end came at 2 PM Thursday 25th of October 2001. She was only 69. She was found dead by her maid on the floor of her bedroom in her apartment at 46 Ave Montaign. She died due to massive brain hemorrhage . Bijan (1937–2001) (who died in Paris one week after Soraya), sadly commented, \"After her, I don't have anyone to talk to.“ The service at the American Church in Paris, a close walking distance from Soraya's apartment was arranged for the 7th of November 2001 and her brother Bijan along with other family members and Paris dignitaries were to attend the services. Bijan, aided by a companion, traveled by car from Koln a few days earlier. Sadly while staying at Hotel George V in Paris, Bijan died suddenly before he could attend the funeral of his sister\n\n264. The memorial service began at 3 PM when the coffin was brought in draped in blue silk and adorned with a single rose carried by 6 pallbearers. A distinguished former cabinet minister of Iran, Dr. Majid Majidi spoke on behalf of the Iranian exiles in France and expressed his condolences to the Bakhtiari family for their loss. Iranian soprano, Darya Dadvar delivered a beautiful Ava Maria by Franz Schubert to the music of the organist.\n\n265. As a young girl, Soraya had pictures of some movie stars framed, in addition to a photo of the young Shah. She would tell all her friends and cousins that one day she will either become an actress or marry the king. None of her aspirations brought her lasting happiness."
