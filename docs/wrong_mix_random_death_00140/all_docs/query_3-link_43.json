        "text": "By Shannon Bunn, student correspondent\n\nTwo members of The University of Scranton faculty in the Panuska College of Professional Studies, Michael Crowell, PT, DSc and Mary L. (Doyle) Troy, Ph.D., NCC, LPC ’95 G’20 advocate for veterans through their academic research and classroom education.\n\n\"I think we owe it to our veterans to make sure they have the tools to live a healthy life. I’ve been involved with a veteran’s organization called Team RWB, whose mission is to enrich veterans' lives through physical fitness activities. This is something that I strongly believe in – the benefit of exercise, not just for physical health, but for mental health as well,\" said Dr. Crowell, an associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy who teaches courses in Orthopedic Physical Therapy and Scientific Inquiry.\n\n\"In addition to my work as a clinician, educator and researcher, I was also involved in a health and wellness initiative at the Army Surgeon General’s Office that sought to utilize these same principles in active duty Army Soldiers.\"\n\nDr. Troy, assistant professor in the Department of Counseling & Human Services Courses developed the course, Counseling with Veterans and Military.\n\n\"Professionally, I teach my students about the culture and needs of veterans. Personally, I am active in lobbying my government representatives for the needs of service members and veterans.\"\n\nShe has also presented on veterans' issues during a Scranton Faculty Workshop Series.\n\n\"One of the key takeaways that I shared was how important it is for faculty to understand the different needs of veteran students (as compared to traditional students), as well as ways to help veteran students achieve success here at Scranton.\"\n\nDrs. Crowell and Troy talk with Royal News about their military service, their academic research and presentations and what inspired them to their roles as educators.\n\nA Word with Michael Crowell, PT, DSc\n\nQ. What inspired you to pursue a career as an Orthopedic & Sports Physical Therapist after your time as a Field Artillery Officer with the U.S. Army?\n\n\"I have been an athlete for most of my life, playing lacrosse at West Point and continuing to compete in 5Ks and bike races after college. While I was interested in sports medicine and physical therapy during high school, an ACL injury at West Point solidified my interest. After four years as a Field Artillery officer stationed in Germany, I was lucky to be accepted to the Army-Baylor Doctoral Physical Therapy Program.\"\n\nQ. You spent nearly two decades dedicated to this medical discipline within the U.S. Army everywhere from Baghdad, Iraq to West Point, New York. What brought you the most fulfillment in this role?\n\n\"The best parts of being a PT were in seeing the results of individual patients that I’ve treated and seeing the professional growth of sports PT fellows that I taught and mentored.\"\n\nQ. What motivated you to become an educator in this field of study?\n\n\"Most of my greatest mentors were educators in some way. That is really a hallmark of medical professions; passing on your knowledge and expertise. I really see this as a way to make your impact greater than anything you could have with just your own patients.\"\n\nQ: I've read that some of your some of your recent published research is related to veterans' issues and treatments, such as \"The Effectiveness of Battlefield Acupuncture in Addition to Standard Physical Therapy Treatment after Shoulder Surgery: A Protocol for a Randomized Clinical Trial,\" among other studies. What interested you most about these studies? How do you feel that your time spent in service to your country helped you facilitate the research?\n\n\"I think research on topics important to these populations, such as pain management, is extremely important to help them perform at their best. My research focus has always been on topics that allow Soldiers and Cadets to return to their military duties as quickly as possible, but at the same time safely. I am particularly interested in these topics because I have seen many Soldiers return to duty before they are ready, often resulting in subsequent injuries.\"\n\nQ. What do you feel is your greatest accomplishment in your career?\n\n\"I think my greatest accomplishment was my time as the Fellowship Director for the West Point Sports Physical Therapy Fellowship. During my four years as the Director, there were 11 program graduates who are now providing leadership and mentorship to physical therapists throughout the Army. The program was awarded $976K in grant funds, published 14 papers in peer-reviewed journals and presented over 20 abstracts at national conferences.\"\n\nQ. What specific talents do you bring to the Panuska College of Professional Studies?\n\n\"I think the main thing I bring to PCPS is my expertise in orthopedics and sports physical therapy. I’ve spent the last 10 years working in the West Point Sports PT Fellowship, which is a great position to continue to build skill and expertise. A unique element that I bring is leadership. I’ve led a 30+ person field artillery platoon as a young 2nd Lieutenant, served as a personnel officer for a 450+ person field artillery battalion, and have been in charge of physical therapy clinics ranging from 4 to 20+ people.\"\n\n$content.getChild('content').textValue\n\nA Word with Mary L. (Doyle) Troy, Ph.D., NCC, LPC ’95 G’20\n\nQ: Your time as a member of U.S. Naval Security Force during Operation Desert Storm U.S. Naval Reserves included work at a Fleet Hospital in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. Thank you for your service. What stands out in your mind from that time? How did it motivate you to pursue a career as an educator?\n\n\"Looking back, what stands out is the change of the public’s perception of the military. Due to the unpopularity of the Vietnam War, the public perception of the military (and service members) was quite poor. There was little respect for those who served in the military (apart from WWII veterans). Operation Desert Storm (the First Gulf War) helped changed that negative perception. The civilian population begin to understand you could protest military actions yet still support military service members. I believe this shift in public perception (and the support it has generated for service members and veterans) has helped greatly with service members’ and veterans’ mental health.\n\nAs an educator, I firmly believe that giving back and helping others is a vital part of my job. Serving in the military was a part of this foundational belief. My service in the military was a way to give back to a country where I have been given many opportunities. It was also a way to help protect and defend not only family and friends, but fellow citizens. As an educator, I now use my talents and voice to help protect and defend – by teaching students the skills they need to help others as well as using my voice to advocate for those marginalized in today’s world.\"\n\nWhat inspired you to develop the course Counseling with Veterans and Military? What seems to resonate the most with students taking the course?\n\n\"The military is its own culture, with unique customs, traditions, ways of speaking and expectations. It is vital to understand this culture if you want to work with veterans. As a veteran and a counselor, I am privy to many of the unique mental health needs of today’s veterans. I was inspired to develop the Counseling With Veterans and Military course because of the great need for mental health services within the veteran population.\n\nIn a successful counseling therapeutic relationship, a key component is developing rapport. If the client doesn’t feel that the counselor understands them or their experiences, it is difficult to establish that rapport. This can often result in the client discontinuing counseling and therefore not receiving the help they need. My goal in developing the veterans course was to equip students with the background and knowledge to understand military culture and the unique mental health needs of those who have served, thereby expanding the number of counselors available to work with our veteran population.\"\n\nQ: You earned your undergraduate and Master’s degrees from The University of Scranton. What brought you back to the University as an educator?\n\n\"The University of Scranton is a special place. Since I stepped foot on campus as an undergraduate, I have felt at home. Part of the reason I feel at home is the supportive community we have here. My undergrad and grad professors were a large part of that supportive community while I was a student. My hope is that I am now a support for my students.\"\n\nQ. Your current role at The University of Scranton is assistant professor with the Department of Counseling and Human Services and prior to that you were an adjunct professor for over 18 years. How do you feel your work aligns with the University’s Jesuit mission?\n\n\"I often say my discipline (counseling) and the Jesuit mission of cura personalis (care for the whole person) go hand-in-hand, and so it is easy to align my work with Ignatian ideals. However, it goes deeper than that. As you walk around campus, you will notice almost every building has “AMDG” inscribed somewhere. This stands for “Ad maiorem Dei gloriam”, the Jesuit motto that means “For the greater glory of God”.\n\nSt. Ignatius states that everything we do should be for the greater glory of God. I feel I have been called to do this and am blessed that I get to work towards this goal in two ways with my career. As a counselor, I have the honor of walking alongside my clients as they work to overcome challenges and obstacles, heal from pain, and become the person they want to be. As a counselor educator in the Department of Counseling and Human Services, I have the privilege of helping my students learn and master the skills they need to help others, as well as understand the dignity and worth of all human beings.\"\n\nQ: You’ve presented internationally on “The psychological impact of parental PTSD on children of military veterans,” among other topics related to veterans’ issues. Please share a bit about your research. What was a specific instance that you realized your work was making an impact?\n\n\"When working with veterans, it’s important to understand that their mental health doesn’t only affect them, it affects their whole family. My research looked at how a (veteran) parent’s PTSD affects the mental health of children. Children’s mental health needs can often get overlooked, especially when a parent is in crisis. My presentation was focused on what types of mental health issues present in children when a parent has PTSD, as well as tools and techniques to help children manage these issues in healthy, positive ways.\n\nCounseling is a field where it can take years to know the impact of your work. I think knowing spreading awareness for a population that was often overlooked is the first step in impacting positive change.\"\n\nQ: What do you view as one of the greatest accomplishments in your career?\n\n\"My greatest accomplishments have come when a student reaches out to say they felt supported by me or that my classroom or office felt like a safe space where they could be their authentic selves. Sounds mushy, but it is the truth. 😊\"\n\nThis year the World Languages and Cultures Department is pleased to host four Fulbright Teaching Assistants from Argentina, France, Tunisia and Germany, a visiting instructor from Japan, and a returning visiting instructor from Taiwan. To learn more about these instructors, please read their biographies below and watch this short video.\n\nThe 2023-2024 Fulbright teaching assistants, graduate assistants and visiting instructors include:\n\nSheila Mignolet - Argentina (Spanish)\n\nRahma Baklouti - Tunisia (Arabic)\n\nNaoko Omori - Japan (Japanese)\n\nJoshua Hartmann - Germany (German)\n\nHéloïse Vérissi - France (French)\n\nYun (Lily) Chiang - Taiwan (Chinese)\n\nXimena Jimenez - LLC (Spanish)\n\nSheila Mignolet\n\n¡Hola a todos! My name is Sheila Mignolet and I was born in Cipolletti, Argentina. Cipolletti is a small city in the Rio Negro province, located at the top of the region called Patagonia. It is best known for its apple and pear exports, but you can find beautiful hidden places nearby such as Isla Jordan, Cueva del León, the riverbank, etcetera.\n\nI was born and raised in Cipolletti, but I lived for five years in the city of General Roca, where I studied to become an English teacher. I graduated from the University of Comahue in 2017 and I have been working as an English teacher since then. I have also participated in research projects that dealt with technology and good practices in education.\n\nThis is the first time that I am teaching Spanish as a Second Language, but I am eager to accept the challenge. I love reading books, dancing and making different types of crafts. I also enjoy learning about new cultures through their music and films, so my playlists often feature a mixture of languages. I am keen on bringing my knowledge into the classroom and making the most of my time at Scranton. I hope my students and I can learn from each other during my time as part of the Fulbright Teaching Assistant Program.\n\nRahma Baklouti\n\nHi everyone! My name is Rahma Baklouti, and I am the Arabic FLTA (Fulbright Language Teaching Assistant). I come from Tunisia. Tunisia is a small country in North Africa. Tunisian culture is highly diverse. Indeed, a significant number of Jews and Christians have lived among a Muslim majority for years. This diversity is also seen in the architecture of the capital, Tunis. The city blends ancient Arab Souks, Cathedrals, Mosques, and modern office buildings.\n\nAt the beginning of my studies, I was interested in the healthcare field so I majored in midwifery. My second major was in English. I hold a Bachelor in English language, literature, and civilization. Moreover, I hold an M.A. in American Studies from the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences of Tunis. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Sousse, Tunisia.\n\nFor three years I worked as a teacher of foreign languages. I taught Arabic, French, and English in primary and secondary schools. Being a university teacher is my dream, therefore, I am here. I am jubilant and honored to teach at The University of Scranton, and I will do my best to help students learn about the Arabic culture and language.\n\nNaoko Omori\n\nこんにちは！\n\nMy name is Naoko Omori. I was born in Kobe, Japan.

My name is Joshua Hartmann and I come from Radeburg, which is a very small but lovely town near Dresden, Germany. I´ve been studying English and geography for Secondary Education at the Technical University Dresden for four years now. (I would, by the way, deeply recommend visiting Dresden if you should ever have the chance to do so, it's a beautiful place!). I've been playing soccer since I was a kid and I enjoy any other kinds of sports and outdoor activities as well. I also have a passion for music and like to be creative with it.\n\nHaving the opportunity to be a Foreign Language Teaching Assistant, I am very happy and excited to share my culture with you and to guide and assist you on your journey of learning German, I hope to learn more about your culture as well! So, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I´m looking forward to it!\n\nHéloïse Vérissi\n\nHi everyone! I am Héloïse Vérissi and I am from Paris, France. You may have heard of my city a couple of times. Between the beautiful architecture, great food, and a lot of cultural events, I do not think that it is possible to ever get bored in it! But France is a lot bigger than Paris and all our regions are so interesting and so unique.\n\nIf you like French cuisine, definitely check out the food from the South-West! I graduated from the University of Paris with a B.A. in English with a focus on English history and then I graduated from Université Paris Cité and University College Dublin last June with a M.A. in European history with a focus on Celtic history.\n\nIt is my very first time teaching and I am very excited to have been chosen to teach here for a year. I hope that I will be able to make my students as excited to speak about France and the French language as I am and I will be more than happy to answer any question you may have about my language or culture.\n\nYun (Lily) Chiang\n\n大家好！ My name is Chiang Yun. You can just call me Yun, or my English name, Lily. I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. You may not know where Taiwan is. Taiwan is a little island between China and Japan. Taiwan is a multicultural island which from China, Japan and Southeast Asia. Taipei is the capital of Taiwan, with a lot of delicious food and motorcycles. Have you tried bubble tea and hot pot? Try it and you will love it!\n\nI graduated from Zhong Yuan University with a bachelor's degree in teaching Chinese as second language. After graduation, I taught at international Chinese school in Korea for six years, so I can speak Korean and I also like watching Korean dramas. While I was working, I went to National Taiwan Normal University to gain my master’s degree in teaching Chinese as second language. It was hard work, but worth it.\n\nI like Chinese, Chinese is a beautiful Language with a lot of culture and history, I also like to experience different cultures. I am honored to teach in Scranton. Wish I could bring my knowledge to students, I believe (教学相长) students can learn from me, and l can learn from them, too.\n\nThe University of Scranton has appointed 22 new full-time faculty members for the 2023-2024 academic year.\n\nHolly Avella, Ph.D. cand., was appointed as a visiting assistant professor in the Communication and Media Department.

Riddhiman Medhi, Ph.D., assistant professor of chemistry at Scranton, will serve as the entrepreneurial lead. Bryan R. Crable, Ph.D., former assistant professor of biology at Scranton and current managing director of North Country Bee Works and assistant professor of microbiology at Pennsylvania Western University, will serve as industry mentor for the project.\n\nHoney has a wide array of uses and applications in food and beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. It is also the third most adulterated food product in the U.S. according to research by Honey Authenticity Network, an international effort of individuals and organizations whose fundamental interest is to prevent honey fraud.\n\nDr. Dumancas noted that more than 60 percent of honey in the United States is imported and can be adulterated with hard to detect adulterants with the overall intent of selling the product at a lower price.\n\n“There is presently no U.S. federal standard for the identification of pure honey,” said Dr. Dumancas. “Current methods for honey authentication are archaic, cumbersome and time consuming, with nearly all of the tests being conducted via third-party labs in Germany using expensive analytical equipment.”\n\nDr. Dumancas said their project will develop an accurate test that can be completed in less than two minutes.\n\n“The proposed technology involves a smartphone application and a spectrometric system that can test the purity of honey by simultaneously determining the quantities of multiple adulterants as well as its floral and geographical origin in a time- and cost-efficient manner,” said Dr. Dumancas, who is the chief inventor of the technology identifying the mid-infrared spectroscopic method for adulterant testing and has conducted extensive studies across various types of honey to assess its purity.\n\n“I’m pleased that The University of Scranton will receive a $50,000 NSF award for the development of a smartphone app intended to bolster consumer confidence in the products they use,” said U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright. “As the Ranking Member of the Commerce Justice and Science Subcommittee, I will continue to do all that I can to help fund projects like this one through the National Science Foundation. Dr. Dumancas and his team are doing incredibly important work at The University of Scranton, and I look forward to the development of their latest innovative technology.”\n\nDr. Dumancas joined the faculty at Scranton in the spring of 2022. Over the course of his academic career, he has generated more than $2 million in external research funding from the NSF, Louisiana State University, and the Louisiana Board of Regents. He has published more than 70 research products in the form of journal articles, book chapters, books and intellectual property disclosures related to his research in the development and applications of chemometrics and spectroscopic techniques in food and biological applications. In the spring of 2023, he published a digital primer titled “Spectroscopic and Chemometric Techniques for Pharmaceutical Applications” through the American Chemical Society (ACS). The peer-reviewed and by invitation only ACS primer focuses on providing basic content about various spectroscopic and chemometric tools in pharmaceutical analyses.\n\nDr. Dumancas also won a research award that will allow him to work with some of the world’s leading scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, as a Visiting Faculty Fellow by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\n\nJust last year, Dr. Dumancas received a five-year, $1.158 million National Science Foundation funded Noyce Scholars grant to support future STEM high school teachers in high-need school districts. The grant provides scholarships and educational training support to 21 STEM students with a major or minor in secondary education.\n\nDr. Dumancas earned his bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the University of the Philippines and his Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from Oklahoma State University.\n\nDr. Medhi joined the faculty at Scranton in 2022. A committed teacher and researcher, Dr. Medhi brings a broad background in applied materials chemistry. Under this NSF grant, Dr. Medhi is spearheading efforts to identify attributes of this spectroscopic invention for seamless technology transfer for industry-wide use. This invention could potentially revolutionize purity testing and tracing across the honey industry. He was previously a post-doctoral associate at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked to develop anti-fouling surface coatings and anti-toxin fabrics. He has applied for two U.S. patents, has authored and co-authored studies that appeared in 12 peer-reviewed publications, in addition to multiple presentations made at national conferences.\n\nDr. Medhi is a member of the American Chemical Society. He earned both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in chemistry from Gauhati University in Guwahati, India, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Houston. At Houston, his research on optical nanomaterials earned him the Graduate Student Research Award, and the prestigious Dan E. Wells Outstanding Dissertation Award.\n\nAs managing director of North Country Bee Works, a family-owned apiary located in Western Pennsylvania, Dr. Crable is involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. He has extensive experience in the beekeeping and honey industry, and will guide the team in networking, understanding the supply chain, and commercial exploration of the relevant sectors.\n\nDr. Crable’s scientific research has been supported by the NSF, The Lake Lacawac Foundation, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory, among others. He has authored or co-authored articles in 12 peer-reviewed publications, which, together with his collaborators, have been cited over 1,000 times. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Saint Vincent College and a master’s degree from Duquesne University. He completed a doctorate in microbiology at the University of Oklahoma. He also earned his MBA degree from The University of Scranton.\n\nA few weeks before a global celebration of the environment, the University of Scranton Professor Emeritus John R. Conway III, Ph.D. will offer lifelong learners an insider perspective on some of the planet’s more unusual inhabitants.\n\nThe retired professor, who taught biology for 40 years at The University, will present an April 6 lecture at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado on the captivating aspects of “The Incredible, Edible Honeypot Ant”.\n\nHe hopes to impart a broader message, which he described as “the diversity of species that evolved on earth and the increasing extinction of them due to human activity.” Dr. Conway will discuss the ecology and biology of the Myrmecocystus mexicanus, or honeypot ant, based on his comprehensive research in the Garden of the Gods, Colorado and the Southwestern Research Station in Arizona.\n\n“Those of us who are biologists and naturalists realize that all forms of life on earth are interconnected and important for the health of the planet. In addition, they collectively are reservoirs of genetic diversity that often is beneficial to discoveries useful to humans,” said Dr. Conway.\n\n“Our accelerating destruction of these forms of life threatens the existence of our planet and our species.”\n\nThat lesson is one that Dr. Conway presented to decades of students during his time at Scranton, through coursework and by leading numerous research trips to the Caribbean and Hawaii.\n\n\"One of the greatest aspects of leading tropical biology trips abroad with the University was that it allowed me to see students learning in a different light, outside the classroom. Every other year during intersession, we were in places such as Belize, Guatemala, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Panama. It was very rewarding,\" said Dr. Conway.\n\nRed-eyed tree frog photographed during a University of Scranton tropical biology trip. Atlantica Lodge near Cahuita, Costa Rica, Jan. 13, 2007. Photo courtesy Dr. John R. Conway III\n\nFrom high school physiology 'nerd' to sought-after Scientific authority\n\n“As I reflect back ... I loved zoology in high school and even did time-consuming India ink drawings of animals in special classes before school. A friend and I were nerds and spent time at my house reviewing a physiology textbook during the summer. When I went to college at Ohio State University ... I first thought of being a pharmacist or veterinarian, but discovered I enjoyed and did well in the required biology courses....\n\nI guess I finally decided that I should do what I most enjoyed, and that if I was successful, I could probably make a living. In my last year at Ohio State, I took summer field biology courses at the Stone Lab on an island in Lake Erie. I applied for a graduate school assistantship in biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I received word of acceptance while on the island.”\n\nIn 1975, Dr. Conway selected a doctoral thesis topic that retains relevance today -- honey ants -- whose workers live to eat, as much as possible, for the survival of the colony. Nearly 50 years later, he remains a sought-after authority on a type of self-sacrificing southwestern and Mexican honey ant.\n\nIn 2018, when he received a $30,000 grant to resume a study of the honey ant at The Garden of the Gods, he reflected on his choice in an interview with Royal News.\n\n“I wanted something that was not only of academic interest, but also of popular interest. I was interested in photography and had National Geographic and other popular scientific magazines in mind. Fortunately, I have been able to achieve that,” said Dr. Conway at that time.\n\nExcerpt from an article published Nov. 8, 2022 in The Durango Herald newspaper, Colorado. Herald Staff Writer Tyler Brown interviewed The University of Scranton Professor Emeritus John R. Conway III, Ph.D. (Photo: Jerry McBride/Durango Herald)\n\nThis past November, Dr. Conway's larger-than-life photo exhibit of honey ants at the Durango Public library garnered media attention from The Durango Herald, shown above.\n\nAlso in 2022, Dr. Conway received an invite to serve as a consultant for a PBS award-winning Deep Look nature series. He provided expert information and created diagrams for the KQED YouTube video feature by Gabriela Quiros, \"Honeypot Ants Turn Their Biggest Sisters into Jugs of Nectar\".\n\nHoney ants: unusual, captivating and sweet\n\nDr. Conway describes four factors of honey ants that, over the years, he and his students have found most captivating about the unusual species:\n\nHow unusual the honey ants are in lifestyle, appearance, and the uniqueness of their adaptation (formation of large repletes to store nectar).\n\nThe fact that repletes sacrifice their lives to store food for the colony, hanging in complete darkness in underground special domed chambers their entire lives, and then die when they are depleted.\n\nThe convergent evolution of the replete adaptation in two unrelated ants living in two widely separated areas of the world: Australia and North America.\n\nThe convergent use of these sweet repletes by Australian Aborigines and early American Indians and the adoption of the honey ant as a totem by certain Australian tribes who developed songs, art, and cave paintings to depict them in their Dreamtime.\n\nUp Next for University Professor Emeritus Dr. John R. Conway III?\n\nDr. Conway retired from the University in 2016, but not before leading research trips with students to the Caribbean and Hawaii and having traveled extensively throughout the world. Those experiences provide fodder for innumerable projects.\n\nClimbing Kilimanjaro, hiking the Inca trail in Peru, and rafting the Futaleufu river in the Patagonia of Chile are among the adventures he plans to document and share. He shared a few that are planned for the near future, including lectures on past educational trips with University students and personal expeditions.\n\n* A lecture on his research on the western thatching ant, Formica obscuripes, which he has observed for years at his family cabin near the West Elk Wilderness in Colorado.\n\n“I secured a Howard Hughes grant and took several University of Scranton students there one summer to conduct a detailed study.”\n\n* A LECTURE on his travels, including two overland truck camping expeditions, and photographs over the years in Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zaire).\n\n\"It would include personal adventures, such as rafting the Zambezi, climbing Kilimanjaro, and finding mountain gorillas in the Virunga Mountains of Zaire.\"\n\nI plan to develop a talk on my travels in South America to Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru. It would include hiking the Inca trail in Peru, hiking in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, and rafting the Futaleufu river in the Patagonia of Chile.\"\n\n*A lecture based on his experiences and photographs in rainforests and coral reefs during his Tropical Biology courses taught between 1981 and 2014 in the Caribbean, Central America, and Hawaii.\n\nA white-faced capuchin monkey in Cahuita, Costa Rica, photographed during a University of Scranton tropical biology trip.

Conway III\n\nOne project remains at the forefront: A book on the biologists and naturalists who discovered the approximately 2 million known plant and animal species that constitute the Earth’s incredible biodiversity.\n\n\"I am conducting research to write a book and give lectures on the great naturalists of history. Currently, I have information on about 100 naturalists. At the moment, I am interested in the first expeditions and naturalists to visit the new lands in the Louisiana Purchase-Lewis and Clark, Zebulon Pike, the Stephen Long Expeditions.\"\n\nAssistant Professor of Biology, Spencer Galen, Ph.D, instructs University students in the classroom, lab and field. In addition to his academic work, Dr. Galen participates in scientific research regarding ornithology, the study of birds, and parasitology, the study of parasites. Recently, DNA he sequenced helped solve a biological mystery. He explains how the collaboration identifies a \"strange-looking bird\" (spotted in Pennsylvania!) as a species unlike any known to science.\n\nWhen he's not instructing Royals in General Biology I and II, General Physiology Laboratory, and Parasitology, he's guiding them toward forward-thinking facets of the field, including statistics and bioinformatics, which he describes as \"powerful tools that scientists increasingly rely on to understand their data\".\n\nToday Dr. Galen discusses his contributions as co-author of \"Genetic confirmation of a hybrid between two highly divergent cardinalid species: A rose-breasted grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus) and a scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea),\" shown, below.\n\nWhat inspired you to research this topic?\n\n\"The story behind my contribution to this study is actually quite an odd one, but one that speaks to the collaborative nature of science. As many people know the news or from popular media, DNA can be used to identify an unknown person of interest whether it may be a suspect in a criminal case or a long-lost relative. We can also use DNA to solve biological mysteries, such as identifying the parents of a hybrid organism.\n\nSeveral years ago a strange-looking bird unlike any species known to science was seen right here in Pennsylvania, and a team of researchers sought to study its DNA to try to determine if it was a hybrid. Coincidentally, I had previously sequenced the DNA of a number of bird species from the eastern U.S.A., and my DNA data was used to solve the hybrid mystery – as it turned out, the bird was a hybrid of two very distantly related bird species (the rose-breasted grosbeak and scarlet tanager, believed to have last shared a common ancestor 10 million years ago).\"\n\nWhat theory did your research team have as to how a hybrid formed under natural conditions in the wild? What techniques were used to solve the mystery of the bird’s origin?\n\n\"The research team that I was involved with used a combination of evidence from DNA, physical appearance, and song analysis to determine the parents of the hybrid bird. While the song of the bird was similar to one of the proposed parental species (scarlet tanager), both the physical appearance and the DNA of the bird appeared to be a perfect mix of the two parents. We really don’t understand the circumstances under which the hybrid formed, but with increasing forest fragmentation and declining songbird populations it may mean that birds are having a harder time finding a mate, possibly making hybridization more likely.\"\n\nWhat is something that has surprised you in your research?\n\n\"A parasite is any organism that lives in or on a host species and depends on that host species for energetic resources. Parasites are everywhere and are extremely diverse, which makes studying them very rewarding as there is a lot of room for discovery. I am particularly interested in what is called parasite biodiversity, which is broadly thought of as the number of species of parasite and their abundances throughout the world.\n\nThe general hypothesis that drives a lot of my research is that parasites are probably even more abundant and diverse than we have previously understood. Using more advanced DNA-based methods my research largely supports this idea, showing that there are likely thousands of undiscovered species of blood parasite that are in need of study.\"\n\nWhat do you recommend to someone interested in pursuing a career in your field?\n\n\"I probably wouldn’t have liked to hear this advice when I was an undergraduate, but it is advantageous to become skilled with both numbers and computers if you want to work in any biological field. I am referring specifically to the fields of statistics and bioinformatics, which are both powerful tools that scientists increasingly rely on to understand their data.\n\nI don’t think someone interested in ecology and evolutionary biology needs to become an expert statistician or bioinformatician (I am certainly not), but having basic skills in these areas will make you a more versatile scientist who has the ability to transition to a variety of other fields. I recommend taking a least one introductory class in statistics (e.g. Biostatistics offered by the biology department) and computer science, to start building these skills.\"\n\nWhat’s next for you in terms of research projects?\n\n\"I have many different projects going on that I am excited about! I have students working on projects related to blood parasites in birds from Alaska, blood parasites that infect birds of prey such as eagles and vultures, discovering new species of blood parasites in the eastern U.S., and identifying what animals insect vectors like mosquitoes are feeding on in northeastern PA, among several other projects. I have a talented group of students working on these studies and I have been thrilled to see them develop as scientists.\"\n\nWhen did you decide to pursue a career as a researcher and educator?\n\n\"I don’t know exactly when I decided that I wanted to be a professor, but I suppose I was always destined to become one because I never considered pursuing a career that wouldn’t allow me to freely explore my interests in science and natural history. As a professor I get to do research with my students on any topic that strikes my interest, which is a special thing about this job that I greatly value.\n\nIt is hard to know when your work as an academic is truly making an impact, and so I try to focus on making sure my students are building long-lasting, positive associations with biology, whether it is in the lab or in the classroom. I think getting the next generation excited about biology is probably the most impactful thing that we can do as professors.\"\n\nOn a Lighter Note...\n\nDr. Spencer C. Galen earned a doctoral degree in Comparative Biology from the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, a Master's in Biology from the University of New Mexico and a Bachelor of Science from the University of Delaware.\n\nFavorite birdsongs?\n\n\"Picking my favorite bird song is like trying to pick a favorite child, but I will throw out one that I am particularly fond of – the Veery is a thrush that spends its summers in Pennsylvania forests that has an eerily beautiful song. You can listen to it here: https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Veery/sounds#.\"\n\nFavorite location for bird watching?\n\n\"In the eastern U.S.A. I think that it is hard to beat Cape May, New Jersey for the best bird watching location. It is a small area packed with amazing bird watching spots that span the transition from forest to the ocean. Visit during Spring or Fall and birds are everywhere! It is also a charming little beach town if you need a different reason to visit.\"\n\nThe University of Scranton has appointed 21 new full-time faculty members for the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nWesam Alramadeen, Ph.D. cand., was named as an instructor in the Operations and Analytics Department.

A. Panuska College of Professional Studies. Wiercinski '83 earned a Master of Hospital and Health Administration from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Bachelor of Science at The University of Scranton. Prior to joining the University full time in 2016, Wiercinski worked as a healthcare administrator for more than 30 years.\n\nHere, he discusses the importance of a degree in healthcare administration, what it means to receive a Jesuit education, and the benefits of the accredited healthcare administration program here at the university.\n\nHow do you think the university's Jesuit mission has impacted your time as a professor?\n\n\"I am a product of a Jesuit high school and Jesuit universities for both for my undergrad and graduate degrees, so I clearly believe in the Jesuit focus on education and making a difference in the lives of others. I believe that a Jesuit education comes with a unique identity in focusing on a transformative educational experience. The focus of the Ignatian tradition is essential to developing individuals who are committed to the betterment of humanity.\n\nIn our pursuit of educational excellence, we hope to reinforce the characteristics of truth, ethics, and that decency toward others is not mutually exclusive of our selected professional work. A Jesuit education brings with it a responsibility of helping students connect with a commitment to a higher power through being servant leaders and having a positive impact on the world in which we live.\"\n\nWhat is your favorite comment ever received on a course evaluation?\n\n\"I appreciate all the comments but one that stuck with me was: \"Your course was life changing, not only for what I learned, but also for how I should embrace life.\"\n\nWhy should students consider a major in HEalthcare administration?\n\n\"Healthcare affects everyone, and it should be viewed as a basic right for everyone. I feel that our program teaches the importance of providing high-quality, cost-effective healthcare through managing the delivery of the continuum of services that we call the healthcare system. Throughout society, healthcare is at the core of a healthy, productive, and progressive population.\n\nThe program at The University of Scranton is one of the most recognized in the country, CAHME accredited, and staffed by a group of professors and adjuncts who have dedicated their lives to making a difference in the delivery of these services. A degree in healthcare administration exposes students to managerial principles, varied delivery platforms, medical ethics, financial analysis, human resources, strategic planning, healthcare law, marketing, and most importantly, being involved in a career that positively affects the lives of others.\"\n\nWhat do you specifically bring to your department?\n\n\"Probably a question better answered by my students and colleagues. Having a fair amount of experience over a 30-plus year career as a healthcare administrator, I feel that I bring a level of expertise and understanding to the classroom through my teaching style.\"\n\nHow would you describe your personal teaching philosophy?\n\n\"My teaching philosophy involves so much more than the course content and what students find in their assigned textbooks. I also believe in teaching life lessons. I like to let students know (through my personal experience) that at times the world will not be perfect, and that one bad experience or chapter in their life does not necessarily represent the rest of the book.\n\nI like to teach students that we can't control everything, but we can control how we respond to those situations. It's more important how we mend ourselves during those times of brokenness that matter. I am blessed to be able to pass on my healthcare expertise as well as the trial, tribulations, and survival of the human spirit. In essence, the Japanese definition of Kintsugi: That we can be more beautiful for having been broken.\"\n\nWhat has been the biggest accomplishment of your career?\n\n\"I never accept sole credit for any accomplishments I achieved as a hospital administrator. Employees never worked for me, they worked with me. It was that collective approach in providing healthcare services to communities, improving the viability of financially-stressed healthcare facilities, and providing much needed healthcare services to underserved communities that were accomplishments. With that said, I think my biggest accomplishment is now, through the ability to connect with my students. As an instructor, I believe that my responsibility does not end in the classroom. Being present for others is an accomplishment.\"\n\nMeet Professor John Wiercinski\n\nA fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives, John Wiercinski also was past Regional Pennsylvania Delegate to the American Hospital Association. Currently he serves on the boards of the St. Joseph Center Foundation, Lackawanna/Susquehanna Behavioral Health Intellectual Disabilities Early Intervention Program, and The Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce. He was past board chairperson for both The Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce and Lackawanna College.\n\nPrior to joining the University full time in 2016, Wiercinski worked as a healthcare administrator for more than 30 years, most recently as Regional Vice President for Geisinger Northeast. Previously, he was President/CEO for Shamokin Area Community Hospital, and COO for Bradford Regional Medical Center.\n\nWiercinski also served as Director of the Bureau of Health Planning for Governor Robert Casey, and as an Assistant Administrator/Captain at U.S. Air Force Hospital, Dover, Delaware.\n\nOn the Lighter Side\n\nWiercinski was recently asked to be the Faculty Mentor to the University's women's volleyball team. He described this role as \"an incredibly rewarding experience.\"\n\nWho is your favorite musician?\n\n\"Bob Dylan.

The poet of a generation.\"\n\nAs Faculty Specialist in the Operations & Analytics Department at The University of Scranton, David Mahalak, Ph.D., aims to provide immersive learning opportunities for students.\n\n“My favorite aspect of teaching is the connection with students,” said Dr. Mahalak. “I do my best to create an environment of mentorship where people can share wisdom to help others see opportunities.”\n\nAt the Kania School of Management he focuses on connecting students with educational and professional opportunities throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania. In addition, he has worked personally with students on supply chain management and process improvement internships.\n\nDr. Mahalak earned a Doctorate of Engineering in Engineering Management from The George Washington University, where his doctoral research focused on using decision support systems to conduct an analysis of alternatives for the Department of Defense acquisition programs.\n\nHere Dr. Mahalak discusses an experience that helped define who he is today, a linear programming class that changed the course of his career and the best advice he ever received from a professor.\n\nWhat has been the biggest accomplishment of your career?\n\n\"My greatest accomplishment as a professional was working as a government contractor on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles and Automated Convoy Operations programs. It was a privilege to work alongside active and retired military personnel. The work that we did extended beyond concepts of revenue and return on investments, and into more meaningful metrics, such as saving lives. It was an extremely rewarding experience to be part of those programs and it helped shaped me into the person I am today.\"\n\nWhat is your favorite comment from a student course evaluation?\n\n\"A student that said they were challenged in my course, but thankful because it enabled them to do more than they thought they were capable of. As an educator, this is one of my main objectives. I want to provide a challenging, but supportive environment so students can build their self confidence to accomplish their personal, professional and academic goals.\"\n\nHow would you describe the culture of your department?\n\n\"The Operations & Analytics Department is very welcoming and open-minded. We are continually discussing the latest industry trends and how we can integrate these concepts into our current and future curriculum. It is great to be part of a department that is adapting to the needs of our students and industry.\"\n\nHow do you think the university's Jesuit mission has impacted your time as a professor?\n\n“There are many talented young people in challenging financial and social situations. I want to give them hope and direction for changing their lives, and show them they also have support within their communities to guide them.”\n\nBest advice you’ve ever received?\n\n\"The best advice that I ever received was during my junior year of undergraduate studies. My professor recommended that I take a linear programming class, which ultimately changed the direction of my life. In this course, I found my passion for applied mathematics, specifically within the business domain. After this class, I decided to pursue my master’s degree in operations research, which lead to employment in the government, doctoral research and several professional opportunities.\n\nLooking back, I am thankful that I broadened myself and took that class, because if I didn’t, it is possible that I could have been on a different path. I always encourage students to challenge themselves, explore new opportunities, and have faith that the decisions and work they put in now will lead to amazing experiences in the future!\"\n\nHow are you an advocate for the use of technology in the teaching and learning process?\n\n\"Technology is a huge component of the statistics and data analytics classes that I teach. I also share my personal recommendations and encourage students to build skills in computer programming, especially in Python.This is a growing need in industry and will open up more employment opportunities for our students upon graduation.\"\n\nWhy should students consider a major in the Kania School of Management?\n\n\"KSOM is an excellent program that is nationally recognized and most importantly, invested in our student’s future. Our faculty includes highly-distinguished researchers, and many of us come from professional backgrounds that enable us to integrate real-world experiences into our courses.\"\n\nMEET DR. David Mahalak\n\nDavid Mahalak, Ph.D., is a Faculty Specialist in the Operations & Analytics Department.

Regular actions completed to the best of your abilities will enable you to accomplish your personal, professional, and academic goals.\"\n\nIs there an event or tradition on campus that you look forward to every year?\n\n\"Casino Night is our semester-end Operations and Analytics club event that enables students to relax and have fun before finals, but also raises nonperishable food donations for the CSSJ!\"\n\nfavorite sports team?\n\n\"Philadelphia Eagles, Fly Eagles Fly!!!\"\n\nSide pursuits:\n\n\"I enjoy playing chess, weight lifting, and volunteer coaching for my children’s’ youth sports teams.\"\n\nIn the news:\n\n* Learn more about Dr. Mahalak's recent participation in a community fundraiser here.\n\n* Read an in-depth profile about his commitment to Northeastern Pennsylvania here.\n\nBy: Kelly Nee '23, student correspondent\n\nAs assistant professor in The University of Scranton biology department since 2018, Cara A. Krieg, Ph.D., uses a local population of wild songbirds to understand social behavior and communication.\n\nDr. Krieg is originally from Woodstock, Illinois. She received her B.A. from Grinnell College, and Ph.D. from Michigan State University, with a dual degree in Zoology and Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology and Behavior.\n\n\"\"I am one of a handful of field biologists in the department. This means that I do most of my research work outside rather than in a laboratory. Students in my lab get hands-on experience with wild animals living in their natural environment,\" said Dr. Krieg.\n\nShe discusses what she brings to the biology department, the University's Jesuit mission, and her current research in the field of bird behavior.\n\n\"I am a behavioral ecologist who uses many techniques from population ecology. This means I spend a lot time watching the behavior of wild birds, and I know a lot about each individual bird in my population. From a teaching perspective, I bring an expertise in animal behavior, animal communication, and evolutionary theory.\"\n\nWhat are your current research interests?\n\n\"I am broadly interested in how ecological and evolutionary forces shape social behavior in wild animals. My lab works with a wild population of house wrens (a native songbird) nesting at Lackawanna State Park. My work is currently focused on two behaviors that have historically been understudied in female animals: female-female aggression and female bird song.\n\nSome work of the past couple summers has focused on (1) whether more aggressive females face longer term costs to survival or health, (2) whether males adjust their reproductive effort when they are mated to a more competitive, aggressive female, (3) how females use their song during naturally occurring territorial conflicts, and (4) how female physiology influences female song production and how this differs from what happens in males.\"\n\nHow do you think the university's Jesuit mission has impacted your time as a professor?\n\n\"The culture of ‘cura personalis’ has definitely impacted my lived experience in this job. I care about my students’ success, both in the classroom and then as humans. It’s refreshing to be at an institution where this type of work is valued and encouraged versus being in a competitive environment where people are focused on tearing each other down.\n\nI also think the University’s Jesuit focus probably impacts the type of student I have in my classroom. I’ve found that students here tend to be more motivated by social justice issues than they have at other institutions where I’ve taught. It’s much easier to teach about aspects of environmental science that impact human society when I know I’m not speaking to deaf ears.\"\n\nWhat location on campus brings you inspiration?\n\n\"I’m a big fan of Loyola Science Center. I love how the windows are such a big part of the design. I enjoy being able to look out my office window and see the plants and birds, even if I am still working inside.\"\n\nHow would you describe the c"
