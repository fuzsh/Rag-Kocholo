        "text": "In 1922, a group of wealthy Parsis in Bombay founded an organization that they dubbed the Iran League. Originally designed to assist their fellow Zoroastrians in Iran, who had suffered from centuries of oppression, the League quickly expanded its objectives to include the promotion of broader Indo-Iranian cultural and economic relations. It became a major player in the flow of ideas, literature, business, and tourist traffic between the two countries. Parsi fervour for Iran stemmed from the brand of Iranian nationalism promoted by Reza Shah, which celebrated the country's Zoroastrian past. In response, the League's leaders argued that the Parsis of India could play a special role in the ‘regeneration’ of Iran under the shah's supposedly benign rule. By the 1930s, however, Parsis’ embrace of Iranian nationalism became a clear reflection of their deep concerns about Indian nationalist politics: they cast Iran as an idealized alternative to contemporary India, where the Indian National Congress had supposedly taken an ominously ‘anti-Parsi’ turn. The Iran League, therefore, was caught between two nationalisms. Worry about India's future even prompted some Parsis to argue that their community should ‘return’ to their ancestral homeland of Iran. The story of the Iran League thus demonstrates the complex position of minorities vis-à-vis the brands of nationalism in development during the interwar years. The Parsis, a wealthy but microscopic minority, responded to political anxieties at home by romanticizing a foreign country and taking part in a wholly foreign nationalist project.\n\n5 For work on the longer, pre-nineteenth century history of interaction between Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians, see, in particular, Maneck, Susan Stiles, The Death of Ahriman: Culture, Identity, and Theological Change among the Parsis of India (Bombay: K.

This number had increased to 114,890 by the time of the 1941 census. At the time, most Parsis lived in Bombay (home to 63,757 Parsis according to the 1941 census) and southern Gujarat, with other large centres in Poona, Karachi, and Calcutta. There were also smaller, but still influential, communities in Rangoon, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Madras, and elsewhere in India, in addition to notable settlements abroad in Hong Kong, Shanghai, London, Singapore, and Aden. For census data, see Leela Visaria, ‘Demographic Transition among Parsis: 1881–1971: I—Size of Parsi Population’, Economic and Political Weekly, 12 October 1974, p. 1737.\n\n54 Kharegat, Rustam, A Tourist Guide to Iran (Bombay: Caxton Press, 1935), p. viiGoogle Scholar. As is hinted by Bulsara's suggestion concerning ‘young men’ and Jeena's tours ‘For Gentlemen Only’, Parsi tourism to Iran had much to do with Parsi ideas of masculinity in the early twentieth century. By the 1930s, there were deep worries in the community that Parsi men were becoming less industrious and enterprising. A reminder of ‘past glories’ in Iran, therefore, could serve as a powerful antidote to this perceived trend. For more on Parsi masculinity, see Luhrmann, The Good Parsi, Chapter 3."
