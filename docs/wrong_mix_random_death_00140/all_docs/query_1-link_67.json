        "text": "Book Summary\n\nFrom the bestselling author of The Septembers of Shiraz, the story of an Iranian man reckoning with his capacity for love and evil.\n\nSet in Iran and New York City, Man of My Time tells the story of Hamid Mozaffarian, who is as alienated from himself as he is from the world around him. After decades of ambivalent work as an interrogator with the Iranian regime, Hamid travels on a diplomatic mission to New York, where he encounters his estranged family and retrieves the ashes of his father, whose dying wish was to be buried in Iran.\n\nTucked in his pocket throughout the trip, the ashes propel him into a first-person excavation―full of mordant wit and bitter memory―of a lifetime of betrayal, and prompt him to trace his own evolution from a perceptive boy in love with marbles to a man who, on seeing his own reflection, is startled to encounter someone he no longer recognizes.\n\nAs he reconnects with his brother and others living in exile, Hamid is forced to reckon with his past, with the insidious nature of violence, and with his entrenchment in a system that for decades ensnared him.\n\nPolitically complex and emotionally compelling, Man of My Time explores variations of loss―of people, places, ideals, time, and self. This is a novel not only about family and memory but about the interdependence of captor and captive, of citizen and country, of an individual and his or her heritage.

In my jacket pocket, hidden inside a mint candy box, were the ashes of my father—Sadegh Mozaffarian—dead for two weeks and estranged from me for thirty-eight years. And next to me, in the back seat of our sedan, was my boss, the minister of foreign affairs. The Iranian delegation—among them the Minister, myself, a couple of translators, and a half dozen security men—was confined to a few designated New York blocks, beyond which we were not permitted to go. \"It's like a goddamn prison,\" I said to the Minister on the first day of the United Nations General Assembly, when I realized the constraints of the phantom barbed wire fencing us in, and he said, \"Hardly. You of all people should know.\"\n\nHis optimism had been tested throughout the trip. Once again American promises had been made to us and broken, the most recent excuse being a tiff between our respective navy ships in the Persian Gulf. The Americans pointed ...\n\nBookBrowse Review\n\nBookBrowse\n\nCovering a range of decades but set against the political backdrop of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Dalia Sofer's latest novel, Man of My Time, is a quietly powerful retrospective look at the accumulation of moments and choices that form a life. Sofer's prose can at times be more telling than showing; however, overall this works for the story. She has a way of slicing right to the heart of a scene, utilizing unexpected and profound imagery that reminds me a bit of Persian poetry, in which multiple lines might approach a theme in different ways...continued\n\nFull Review (758 words)\n\nThis review is available to non-members for a limited time.
