        "text": "The Fajr International Film Festival is a gala affair, small enough to meet and share time with the many participants, both filmmakers and invitees from countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Armenia, Turkey, Japan, Mongolia and Korea (and more!). I can only think of one other film event which offered such a luxurious array of experiences to go along with film watching (when Rosskino of Russia invited 25 U.S.distributors and us to Moscow and St. Petersburg and then repeated the event for BRICS countries with us organizing the invitation lists for both). The Fajr International Film Festival and Market rivals this event as a high point in my professional life.\n\nOf the five U.S. guests invited, which included Sundance’s Paul Federbush, Seattle Film Festival’s Justine Barda, The Hollywood Reporter’s Deborah Young, and SydneysBuzz’ Peter Belsito, writer Godfrey Cheshire and myself, in the end only two of us got visas, something no one there quite understood. We were invited by the Festival Director, Reza Mirkarimi and Farabi Cinema Foundation’s Amir and Mohammad Esfandiari and Kamyar Mohsenin, known by everyone in the international film business as the face of Iranian cinema.\n\nThis week in Iran was an olive branch extended to the entire world, a moment in time granted by Iran’s highest authorities, passed through the Minister of Culture to the festival itself to show international and its own cinema to the public and to writers, film curators, festival programmers, producers, directors from India, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Japan, China, Malaysia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Armenia, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia and other countries north, south, east and west to meet each other, tour the city’s many attractions, freely roam and freely converse.\n\nThe festival and market take up three floors in a large shopping mall, including the food court of concessions ranging from Persian food (the most crowded) to hamburgers, Mexican fare and salads. On second look at the place, one realizes that all the lower floors are exclusively selling mobile phones and their accoutrements.\n\nWe were all given a credit card for all the food we wanted for the duration of the festival although breakfast is served in the Ferdowsi Grand Hotel where all the guests stay, and for dinner we usually went with a group to a specially chosen restaurant or with friends to explore other restaurants we have heard about. We were also given chips for our cel phones so with a local number we could be in touch with everyone. I hope to use it next year!\n\nOne evening, a new friend, Lia Beltrami of the Italian production company Aurora invited Francisco Perez, Programmer of Mar del Plata FF in Argentina and me to her friends’ for dinner. Darius and Samira served us a very Iranian meal, begun with coffee and pastries and progressing to a delicious repas of meats and vegetables, followed, of course, by dessert. We had a great evening getting to know them and their two sons in their lovely home.\n\nThe festival is directed by Reza Mirkarimi, himself a screenwriter and film director and whose latest film “Daughter” has won directing and acting awards in Asian and European festivals such as Goa, Moscow and Asia Pacific. The many special sections of included a tribute to the recently deceased master of Iranian cinema, Abbas Kiarostami. The other American, Godfrey Cheshire, a gifted and well respected film critic and journalist is also an expert on Kiarostami and will, on his return home, retire from his busy New York life for a month to his home in North Carolina to finish a book on Kiarostami which he began several years ago.\n\nIn Dissent, one of the magazines Cheshire writes for, he had this to say about Iran and its cinema:\n\n…it’s important to recall that that regime is authoritarian, not totalitarian. Visitors often marvel at how candid and open Iranians are in expressing their displeasure with the latest official idiocies. As soon as one set of troublesome newspapers gets shut down, another springs up. Punk rock, heavy metal, and rap flourish in underground Tehran, and the blogosphere remains a hotbed of dissident opinion of every sort. This cultural climate helps explain the apparent paradox that, while Iranian filmmakers are hemmed in by restrictions and impediments on every side, they keep making vital films, sometimes great ones. Within days of Khaneh Cinema’s being suppressed, Farhadi’s “A Separation”, which has received worldwide critical acclaim, became the first Iranian film to win the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Film. And as it plays across the United States in early 2012, our art houses will also see the release of Panahi’s “This Is Not a Film”, made clandestinely while the director was under house arrest awaiting the appeal of his prison sentence.\n\nSo Iranian cinema is thriving.\n\nIranian films in the Market Screenings which were recommended to me by Kiril Razlogov, the Programming Director of the Moscow International Film Festival were “Yeva” by Anahid Abad about a young woman who flees her in-laws with her daughter after her husband’s tragic death and hides in one of the villages of Karabakh, Armenia (ISA: Farabi Cinema Foundation), “High Noon” by Mohammad Hossein Mahdavian for its depiction of terrorism on both sides, and “Untaken Paths” by Tahmineh Milani for its feminist view of society in which a young girl starts a relationship with the brother of one of her classmates which, once her traditional family discovers it must, according to the culture, lead to marriage.\n\nYou can access the entire festival catalog here (though not the market).\n\nFestival sections aside from those showing Iranian films include Festival of Festivals showing masters of cinema like , a Panorama of Films from Asian and Islamic Countries, a Korean Retrospective, a Retrospective of Baltic Cinema, Broken Olive Trees: Middle East in War, Shadow of Horror with six midnight screenings of horror films, Restored Historical Films, Talent Campus, a consortium on De-Westernizing Cinema and the IFM Iranian International Film Market in which Iranian films are made available to distributors.\n\nAt least 68 students from 32 countries as well as 52 students from Iran took part in the inspiring, educational film making workshops of the 2017 Fajr where I presented my own three-hour presentation of the international film circuit. It seemed to be a big success with students following up with me for the powerpoint and complimenting me for the presentation.\n\nThe Awards Ceremony’s unique staging, mixed with live music and set in a beautiful classic theater was not made of your usual boring speeches. Beautifully mounted against a screen of Arabic windows with filmed scenes depicting the theme of peace, quite clearly it was designed to promote peace among the many nations represented by the audience and the films themselves.\n\nWhen mistakes in staging occurred, as often does happen in these one-time grand events, always amusing the audiences, the lightness of acknowledgment was endearing. In fact, everything about this festival was endearing and given with open hearts. We were all impressed by the warm hospitality shown to us all as we discussed movies, movies, movies and politics.\n\nIn attendance at Tehran’s Vahdat Hall on Closing Night were Culture Minister Seyyed Reza Salehi Amiri, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Director of Iranian Cinema Organization Mohammad Mehdi Heydarian, plus a large number of A-list Iranian and foreign film directors, producers, critics, journalists, academics, and stars. In the speech of Reza Mirkarimi, the expression of gratitude to the government for the free hand they had allowed the festival in its programming and in its staging was clearly sincere and one hopes it will continue.\n\nAddressing the participants, Fajr festival director Seyyed Reza Mirkarimi said:\n\nI would like to extend my gratitude to all those who worked round the clock to help me make this up-and-coming event possible. We are now more than ever determined to turn Fajr International Film Festival into an annual event for those who are vying for global peace, justice and dignity both in their films and in their workings.\n\nHosted by prominent actor Ashkan Khatibi, the ceremony was broadcast live in both English and Persian languages.\n\nFull List of Winners:\n\nInternational Competition (Cinema of Salvation)\n\nGolden Simorgh for Best Film: “The Home”, Asghar Yousefinejad, Iran. Though an Iranian film, it is made in Turkish with Persian subtitles. Opening with a grieving daughter who has been out of contact with her family for six years since her marriage, she has returned back to his father’s home only to find that he is being transferred for an autopsy. This comes as Sayeh cannot come to terms with his father’s strange will. The full film description contains spoilers. Great acting by the female lead!\n\nIt is worth noting that 60% of Iranians speak Turkish and 30% come from Iranian Azerbaijan.\n\nSilver Simorgh for Best Director: Ivan D. Gaona, “Guilty Men”/ “Pariente” from Colombia\n\nSilver Simorgh for Best Actress: Margita Gosheva, “Glory”, Bulgaria\n\nSilver Simorgh for Best Actor: Stefan Denolyubov, “Glory”, Bulgaria\n\nSilver Simorgh for Best Script: “The Home”, Asghar Yousefinejad, Iran\n\nSilver Simorgh for Special Jury Prize — Art Direction and Cinematography: Zhu Jinjing (Cinematography), Wang Tou (Art Director), “Mr. No Problem”, (China, France)\n\nSilver Simorgh for Best Short Film: “Online Shopping”, Ghasideh Golmakani, Iran\n\nJury: Florian Gallenberger (Germany), Jessica Woodworth (USA), Lech Majewski (Poland), Mieko Harada (Japan), Uberto Pasolini (Italy), Fatemah Motamed-Aria‎‎ (Iran), and Rasoul Sadrameli (Iran).\n\nMuhammad Al Ameen Award\n\n“Babaei”, Mozaffar Hosseinkhani Hezaveh, Iran. Alireza Babaei is a university teacher, studying for his Masters degree who decides to go to Syria and fight ISIS in order to defend the Ahl al-Bayt. Alireza has two daughters who both love their father and yet approve of his leaving. At the start of his journey, he stops in Iraq…\n\nAsian Film Awards\n\nBest Asian Film: “Returnee”, Sabit Kurmanbekov, Kazakhstan\n\nBest Asian Director: Shahrbanoo Sadat, “Wolf and Sheep”, Afghanistan/Denmark/France/Sweden\n\nBest Asian Short Film: “Not Yet”, Arian Vazirdaftari, Iran\n\nJury: Hamida Omarova (Azerbaijan), Omirbaev Darezhan Karazhanovich (Kazakhstan), Zeki Demirkubuz (Turkey), Nejib Ayed (Tunisia), and Kamal Tabrizi (Iran).\n\nInterfaith Award\n\n“Knife in the Clear Water”, Wang Xuebo, China\n\nJury: Michał Legan (Poland), Katia Malatesta (Italy), and Hojatollah Ayoubi (Iran).\n\nNETPAC Prize\n\n“The Home”, Asghar Yousefinejad, Iran\n\nJury: Anne Demy-Geroe (Australia), Rolando B. Tolentino (Philipines), and Houshang Golmakani (Iran).\n\nBTW, I was told to be sure to see KIM Ki-Duk’s 2016 film “The Net” about a North Korean fisherman who accidently drifts down to South Korea.\n\nAfter enduring many brutal investigations, he eventually gets sent back to North Korea. But before leaving South Korea, he sees how developed the country is and the contrasting dark sides of it. He realizes that economic development does not spell happiness for the people…\n\nThere is so much more to be praised about the festival and our treatment. Every day were walking tours. The Contemporary Museum of Art’s current show, Berlin-Rome Travelers, was meant to travel but at the last minute the government cancelled the trip. Out of the 3,000 works of world class 19th and 20th century art collected by the Empress Farah Pahlavi in 1977, just two years before the 1979 Revolution, these were the creme de la creme of top artists including DeKooning, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Wassily Kandinsky and many others. I have never seen a Picasso like this one or a turquoise Kandinsky or Max Ernst. And David Hockney’s 8700 Melrose Avenue struck so close to home! (I live up one block from Melrose).\n\nWe went to the Golestan Palace with its Hall of Diamonds, even surpassing Versailles and its Hall of Mirrors,\n\nThe Carpet Museum explains the finesse of Persian rugs when compared to Turkish rugs (double knot vs. single knot). It gave me great pleasure to learn about the designs, especially the motif we call “Paisley” which is actually a cypress tree which stands tall as a symbol of strength, but bends to the force of winds yet but never breaks. It is also highly flammable when deprived of the water which nourishes it.\n\nAnd I saw the royal treasury, so filled with diamonds, rubies and emeralds, gifts of governments for over 600 years including those of the Shah and his discerning wife who literally dripped with diamonds on special state occasions (ending badly in the Revolution, though she lives very well today in Paris where she still occasionally welcomes visitors). This makes the Tsar’s treasury look paltry.\n\nOne day, which happened to be the birthday of the prophet Mohammed, we were treated to a day at the Ghazali Studios where the Cinema Town rivaled that of 20th Century Fox’s “Hello Dolly” set. Covering an area of 10 hectares, Ghazali Cinema Town was established in 1971 and is comprised of various state and historic buildings; streets, and places, facsimiles of Tehran 100 years ago. Extras strolled around giving us flowers, leading horses, staging arguments, even a prisoner was chased by policemen. In the end, they posed for pictures for us and asked us to pose for them.\n\nI especially loved the Egyptian Temple where we sought shade from the hot sun and the Temple of Jerusalem with its Hebrew letters taking me by surprise and the footage of the films shot there which were projected onto a giant screen.\n\nThe people I met and hung out with were also special and it could not have happened this way at any other festival I can name.\n\nThe director and writer of the Antalya Film Festival prize-winning favorite “Rauf”, Baris Kaya and Soner Caner and I went to the flea market together shopping for gifts to bring back home.\n\nThe other Turkish film we on the Turkish Film Jury at Antalya awarded multiple prizes to, “My Father’s Wings”/ “Babamin Kanatlari” will be in L.A. this week at SeeFEST and I recommend going to see it. I had a great time talking with its director Kivanc Sezer. Set against the backdrop of construction activity promising to fill in the empty spaces of the urban landscape with entirely new neighborhoods, a story unfolds of an aging construction worker who, unlike his peers, has to drop all plans for the future after being diagnosed with a malignant tumor. This debut film contemplates the dignity of the individual within the context of modern Turkish society.\n\nThe closing night dinner I had with Lidia Leber Terki, the French filmmaker of “Paris la Blanche” who I will see again in Cannes and filmmaker Jajane Cnoer of Indonesia and the journalist from Armenia, Diana Martiosyan who will also be in Cannes as well as Arya Su Altioklar, who created a student short film festival when she was in college in Istanbul.\n\nHere representing a Retrospective of Baltic Cinema was Edith Sepp, Director of the Estonian Film Institute who told me that the cash rebate system generated over 1.5 m EUR of inbound investment in 2016 and that the recepient of the first FilmEstonia cash rebate grant, “Eternal Road” / “Ikitie”, directed by Antti-Jussi Annilaand and produced by Finland’s Matila Röhr Productions in coproduction with Sweden’s Person Anagram and Estonia’s Taska Film, started shooting in June 2016. Total admissions reached an all-time high of 3,290,750, a 6% increase from 2015. Another record is 2.4 admissions per capita. Total box office reached a record of 17,665,337 EUR, 12% more than in 2015. Netflix also entered the Estonian market early in 2016, but with a heavily limited program with no Estonian subtitling so far.\n\nTheir film “In the Crosswind” was showing at the festival.\n\nOn the Lithuanian side of the Baltics, I had one fish bar-b-que dinner with Vida Ramaskiene, Director of the Vilnius International Film Festival and Ieva Norviline, the producer of the festival film “King’s Shift” by Ignas Miskinas about a rookie policeman left alone in a private clinic on Christmas Eve to guard a comatose World War II war crimes suspect. His shift is long over, yet nobody comes to replace him. Determined not to leave his post until he gets permission from his authorities to do so and suffering from lack of sleep, loneliness and hunger, he becomes a ticking time bomb when he must decide how far he can go on guarding this suspect who is hated to death by everyone. The head of the Lithuanian Film Center, Dovile Butnoriute and I also shared some fun moments.\n\nOne of the most interesting meetings I had was with Monica Wahi, the Director of the Southasian Children’s Cinema Forum based in Mumbai and Delhi. She is young and adventurous and has created a very powerful database of children’s cinema from around the world. Nothing like it exists, a sort of IMDb crossed with Facebook for programmers, broadcasters, educators and parents. IMDb was interested enough in this to ask for a meeting but in the end said their main audience is a male 16–36 year old demographic. A European organization was interested but in the end decided to make their own database (I know they will not be able to approximate hers). She is looking for a home for this. She will keep the technical side functioning but has so many other projects going that she needs a dedicated umbrella to own it and expand it worldwide. If I were still in the database business or wanted to specialize in worldwide children’s programming, I would jump on this opportunity to take control of this great service.\n\nThis is the only film festival I have attended where such quality time with people from all over the world was possible.\n\nAnd it all happened in such a demonized part of the world (that is, U.S. demonizes it). As I said, the politics are not apparent except for the occasional large poster or wall painting of the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, and on some occasions, the candidates for the upcoming election of the President to be elected from a roster of candidates pre-approved by the Council of Guardians. A certain cult of personality, though not as obviously displayed as in Cuba or as in Turkey, but nevertheless, you are aware that there is a ruler and he is the head of the Shia Moslem community in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Thankfully, we in U.S. are spared such large visions of our so-called president. The Iranian people themselves, just like all people everywhere are normal, happy, unhappy, striving, hoping, enjoying family, art, shopping, eating and entertainment. Poverty is not apparent and though the city streets are bustling and traffic is as bad as in L.A.; the buildings are mostly dingy and unattractive and most look like they were built in the 30s and 40s and the city seems to have just grown with no plan or coherency. Another thing, most Iranians I spoke with (and they are very friendly and curious about foreigners), had some family living in the United States.\n\nPolitics and history are both not visible to the outsider like me who walks down the streets and visits with normal people. While I hear that the Turks do not like Iran (and fear their own turning into a religious state), they are definitely neighbors. Both had extensive empires long before America had even been discovered. But seeing the people today, it would seem the wisdom one would wish could be derived from such history has no place in daily life anymore than our own sense of history determines our daily lives.\n\nHowever, the meeting of people seemed to go beyond mere networking; we seemed to be forging new friendships and insights, giving direction to ideas we rarely have time to develop in the rush of everyday chores and tasks to accomplish. At least, I hope this is the result of my time there.\n\nI am now looking forward to Cannes where I will see “Yeva” and also Iran’s Directors Fortnight entry, “Dregs”. Mohammed Rasoulof’s last film “Manuscripts Don’t Burn” was a sleeper hit in Un Certain Regard and brought him kudos in Telluride. His films make waves because he is highly critical of the authoritarian government of Iran. Little information is available on this film however, though it is expected to provide another critical look at Iranian leadership at an especially potent moment in global politics."
