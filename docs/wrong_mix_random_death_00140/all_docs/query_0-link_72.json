        "text": "The Arrival of McNeil Construction on Site - Back then, it was known (not as Disneyland, but) simply as “the site.” What was Disneyland “attendance” actually like before the Park opened? Among the first people at the site was Personnel Manager Fred Newcombe, who was also one of the first people hired by Personnel Manager Fred Schumacher. Directly under Joe Fowler’s direction was Charles Wilkinson of property, design coordination, construction administration, and maintenance analysis.\n\nMcNeil Construction Company (Founded by John V. McNeil in 1886; a partnership between Lawrence G. McNeil and his son Bruce) was located at 5858 Wilshire in Los Angeles. McNeil Construction had quite the reputation. The firm was renown for their work on the Firestone plant in Los Angeles, the Willys Overland plant in Los Angeles; Union Oil Co. plant in Wilmington; Lockheed Aircraft plant, Burbank; Times-Mirror building in Los Angeles; Ninth and Broadway Building in Los Angeles; First Trust Building in Pasadena, the Farmers and Merchants Bank Building in Long Beach. the Security - First National Bank Building in Long Beach. and 400 2-bedroom homes for the Navy in Long Beach. Naturally, McNeil was fitting for the unique and huge undertaking of Disneyland!\n\nMcNeil began moving equipment onto the Disneyland site in mid-July, 1954. At that time, F. M. Franz was manager of operations for McNeil Construction Company. “McNeil crewmen first had to remove 12,500 orange, trees, 700 eucalyptus trees and 500 walnut trees.” Oren Gallegly recalled: “The union sent me to Disneyland in 1954 and started working in construction, pulling out orange trees.” Gil Pimentel remembered: “I was with Bill Evans, who was the foreman then. My job was driving a tractor around the berm which had just been built. would spread hay on both sides of it, so when the rains came, it wouldn't wash away.”\n\nGround breaking began on July 17, 1954 (by Joe Fowler’s account) or July 12, 1954 (by Van Arsedale France’s account), or July 16 (according to some Disneyland Wallet Fact Cards). According to Joe Fowler, “As the first shovel of earth was turned, the grand opening...to be beamed around the world on T.V. had been scheduled for the next year. That left 365 days to build what some have called the ‘eighth wonder of the world.’” According to Van Arsdale France, the amount of time between July 12, 1954 and the opening date of July 17, 1955 was viewed as a “practical possibility for a production time.”\n\nAfter the trees were removed, the underground utilities were installed. Excavation took place in August 1954. Over the next few months, 4,000 Lineal feet of sewer line was installed, 2,000 lineal feet of storm drain piping was installed, 4,000 feet of gas line and 7,000 feet of water line was installed.\n\nBy September 16, 1954, Walt could excitedly wrote to his sister Ruth Beecher in Portland, Oregon, briefly mentioning “We are very busy here at the studio, what with the television program and getting our DISNEYLAND Park under way, we’re knee-deep in work.”\n\nThough Walt had responsibilities to oversee the television and feature film production at the Burbank Studio, he soon found time to visit the site in Anaheim daily. This Walt regularly did, either by car or helicopter. Once arrived, Walt would tour the site by jeep, walking, or even using a bicycle (the latter was speculated by many but could not be recollected by Van France, and has only recently been confirmed through discovered footage).\n\nFinance - Walt Disney Productions owns 34.48% of Disneyland, Inc. with an investment of $500,000 in common stock, and holds options on shares aggregating 31.04% presently owned by Walter E. Disney, WED Enterprises and Western Printing and Lithographing Company of Racine, Wisconsin. The options are exercisable at any time before May 1, 1959 for a total price which will not exceed $562,500. The remaining 34.48% is owned by American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. Investment in stock and advances to Disneyland, Inc. totaling $2,883,101 (including $24,301 accrued interest) was carried on the Walt Disney Productions Balance Sheet at approximately book value. About this time, Walt Disney Productions had entered into an eight year contract with the American Broadcasting Company under which they agreed to deliver film to the broadcasting company (at an $,8000 royalty per film, payable monthly to Disneyland, Inc.). Much of the film delivered to ABC would document the developement of the site that would become Walt Disney’s Disneyland.\n\nThe “Walt Disney Productions Annual Report to Shareholders and Employees” for the Fiscal Year Ended October 2, 1954 shared: “In our last mid-year report we told of our television contract with American Broadcasting Company and our television plans. Since Wednesday, October 27, we have been telecasting a one-hour program weekly. We are happy to report that the public reception has been excellent and that our sponsors and ABC are well pleased… A total of 152 stations, including 15 in Canada, now are airing Walt Disney's DISNEYLAND series for ABC-TV. This represents an increase of 43 outlets since the television show was introduced October 27. DISNEYLAND also is reaching over 40 million viewers weekly, according to, several surves conducted by American Research Bureau, Nielsen, Trendex and other audience-sampling organizations. With his entire program of shows for ABC-TV network in work or completed for the current season, Walt Disney will present 26 new shows in the year starting in September, 1955. They are outlined as follows: A Premierland program to be followed by two holiday shows at Christmas and Easter, in addition to shows from the Tomorrowland realm of DISNEYLAND; Frontierland, Adventureland, and several surprise shows from Fantasyland. The 1954-1955 series continues until June.\n\n‘For the Most Outstanding Television Series for Children of All Ages,’ Walt Disney's DISNEYLAND, as telecast by the ABC network, received a Sylvania Television Award for 1954. In accepting the honor, Disney said in part: ‘We hope to bring to television the enthusiasm and hard work, the same respect for the hopes, the dreams, and the intelligence of the American family, that we have tried in some measure to bring to the motion picture screen.’…\n\nWe have embraced television not only for itself and its possibilities, but also to exploit and sell our motion picture product. While we expect to make a profit directly from television sales, such profit will not be great.”\n\nThe first episode of the Disneyland television series aired October 17, 1954. That very month, the WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS ANNUAL REPORT to Shareholders and Employees (for the Fiscal Year Ended October 2, 1954) announced: “The construction of Disneyland is progressing satisfactorily. Present plans are for an opening in July, 1955. While it is a big undertaking, involving many problems, we feel confident of its opening on schedule. The total of Walt Disney Productions investment in Disneyland, Inc. is $500.000.”\n\nIn 1955 alone, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences soon awarded Disneyland the Emmy for Best Variety Series for 1954 (in addition to two additional awards for Best Individual Show for 1954 and Best Television Film Editing awarded to the episode entitled “Operation Undersea” on DISNEYLAND).\n\nAs a sidelight, by the end of the 5-year period (in May of 1959), the goal was 26 films per year at $208,000 annually. Needless to say, Walt Disney Productions’ 16mm rental division helped launch Disneyland Park in 1955!\n\nBenefits were abundant. For instance, some who watched the Progress Reports applied to work for Disneyland, like Pete Crimmings.\n\nJanuary 1955: “By January 3rd, about $50,000 worth of machinery had been installed, but power was not available until Jan. 17, and the mill went into production on that date.” In the meantime, many more employees joined the Disneyland, Inc. team in 1955, including George Mills who recalled: “On January 3, 1955 I came to Disneyland and worked for McNeil Construction Company, raising steel and pouring concrete. For the most part, the Park was built in six months. Our mill was where the Opera House is now and the workers wore blue jeans and white T-shirts.”\n\nLucy Cottom (who came to California in January, 1955 and bought a home in Garden Grove). Lucy Cottom recalled: “I was applying for a job with Robertshaw Company, when a gal came and said that Disneyland was looking for bookkeepers. I went over, saw Milt Albright, and he put me to work in the SNAKE PIT! It was a dark, crummy looking place with people all jammed together...a frightful mess! My first lob was with Accounts Payable, and we had three tubs filled with $17.000,000.00 of unpaid invoices!...it was unbelievable! The bills were coming in faster than you could process them!”\n\nMay 1955: “In May came word that the Disneyland personnel working at Burbank would be moved to the Disneyland site within the week. This meant that office workers for architectural and construction jobs would move out of the administration office, but there was no place to move. In true Disneyland tradition, construction men vaulted the problem like a high jumper at a track meet. They simply built a new house 3200 feet of office space, complete: ly equipped--moved in, and were working steadily when the ‘newcomers’ arrived week later.”\n\nApplications for employment came to Disneyland from such far away places as South America, England, France and Saudi Arabia. A young Richard A. Nunis arrived in May, joining with the “temporary” role of Orientation Training Instructor and assisting the training of more than 850 individuals. That same month, Jim Quigley “drove by the construction site where Disneyland was being built and obtained an application for a job from the Security Office. ‘The area surrounding Disneyland was covered with orange groves and most of the roads were mud or only half completed,” he recalled. Bob Allen recalled: “I went out and stood in line for several days running, before opening. I kept going back. standing in line, and being told there were 'no jobs. Finally, I made it to the front of the line, and I was hired. By this time I was curious, and asked the interviewer who hired me, ‘Why me?’ ‘You're the only one who's got a tie on,’ he told me.”\n\nSix weeks before July 17, 1955, the construction of Walt’s $17 million project should have been wrapping up, but plans were behind schedule. “The construction department was following hard on the heels of planners and about this time, a friendly competition, develop between the designers and construction men. Production jumped ahead as each worked feverishly to keep ahead of the other.” Earl Wuestneck recalled: “When I started work, the streets were still dirt...I didn't think they'd make it for opening!” Al Alvarez came to Disneyland on June 23, 1955 working for George Mills Sr., owner of the Mills Construction Company. “We had a lot to do to get the place ready on time. I didn't think we were going to make it. We were working around the clock.”\n\nBy this time the workforce was still smaller than the population of “many little towns across this country,” (according to “Walt Disney’s Guide to Disneyland). The first 257 “working days” (from July 20th, 1954 through July 16th, 1955) saw the growth of the Disneyland construction crew (essentially the primary contractor, McNeal Construction Company). “Some 800 workmen were employed daily,” (according to “Building A Dream,” prepared by Disneyland, Inc. Public Relations Department, c. June of 1955). And so the workers seemed to speed up as the opening date neared. Dean Narath recalled working “120 hours a week for the four weeks before opening!” Van Arsdale France once commented about how “the final days and hours before opening created a form of mass adrenilin flow which makes everyone perform at, perhaps, 200% of their ability.” At that time (six weeks before Press Preview Day) the Los Angeles Mirror reported that “3,100 carloads of people stopped by the still closed gates and wanted to get in for a look at the construction.” Soon, John Grover (Staff Writer of the Mirror-News, published for June 10, 1955) who was present, reported another large figure of “more than 1,100 workers… putting in a 10-hour day, six days a week.” Eventually, as opening date neared, “a corps of 2,500 workers” was “finishing the colossal task of converting 160 acres of orange grove into a fabulous park called Disneyland,” according to The Sacramento Bee. This last figure is substantiated by the narration of “Disneyland - The Park,” a Disneyland anthology series episode first aired 1957, which stated : “to make sure we would keep our date with the deadline, more than 2,000 craftsmen were employed during peak construction periods.” This increase in workforce is assuredly due to the fact that the Grand Opening Date neared, with still much work to complete.\n\nAmong these were the ABC Roofing Co., Pioneer Roof & Shingle, AE Fowler & Sons, Al Sparks Electric Company, American Fence Company, Arthur Pizzinat Venetian Terrazzo, Bailey the Plumber, Chef’s Laundry & Linen, Evans & Reeves Landscaping, Floats,Inc., Frank Silveri Tile & Marble Contractor, George Mills Sr. General Contractor, Hendricks & Stearns Hardwood Floors, Kissell Refrigeration Company, Larson Bros. Plastering Co., Masterson. Scaffold Co., Master-Bilt chain link fence, M.A. Gentile (brick, block, and stone work), Merchants Police Protective Service, Pacific Rug & Carpet Co., Raydell R. Bobst Masonry Contractor, Screenmaster, The Tabery Corp., and Universal Homemakers Inc.\n\n“Unions & Strikes” - Over 60 subcontractors were employed on the project. Walt had previously dealt with a Studio strike and “he carried the scars,” according to Van France. France continues: “The construction unions flatly said that if we didn’t recognize the union, we wouldn’t open… a totally unacceptable fact. And the unions which were searching for jurisdiction presented a major problem. The American Guild of Variety Artists, AGFA… wanted jurisdiction over the Jungle Cruise operators. The Inland Boatmen wanted it over the Mark Twain. And their rates were very high. After the panic buttons were pushed, we settled for negotiations with the Orange County Central Labor Council. AFofL… We ended up with 29 unions.” Van France added: “Things weren’t all bad for the union construction workers. Most were working long days… and seven days a week. And, some worked under very good agreements. As a result, many were getting more than the normal time-and-a-half. The hours got into double time, and in some instance, more than that. That is called ‘golden time’… and, even in those days, it amounted to nearly a thousand dollars a week for some.” In light of this, there had been a national plumbers strike that affected the building of certain necessities like restrooms and drinking fountains.\n\nAround this time, Disneyland Site Manager Joe Fowler stayed optimistic, telling Bob Thomas (of the Associated Press), “We’ll make the opening. Just barely, but we’ll make it.” As to the number of Disneyland staff being trained for the Park, Nash Airflyte Magazine attempted to give an idea of the figure, stating that “a permanent staff of more than 500 will be employed.” The true-life figure would decrease to 850 and 1000 employees (including lessees).\n\n“Operation Disneyland” - The grand opening preview was expected to run an hour and a half and be televised nationally. Such lengthy television programs filmed on location were mostly unheard of in these days. At Disneyland, so much preparatory work went into the televised opening. For about two months prior to the opening, television crews (in addition to those construction workers) had been busy setting up 5 control rooms (to accommodate 12 television stations and a total of 24 cameras), stringing up miles of coaxial cable, and rehearsing for the debut of Disneyland through “the world’s largest live telecast” (as seen in “Operation Disneyland” produced for ABC by Dick Brown). “The greatest concentration of TV cameras and equipment ever assembled in one place,” would ensure that “Dateline Disneyland” introduced Walt Disney’s Disneyland coast-to-coast, airing through a one-and-a-half hour ABC-TV spectacular, beginning at 4:30 p.m. PDT, on July 17th, 1955. Other networks like CBS-8 San Diego was present. According to the Orange County Register, there were “twenty-four cameras, a behind camera staff of 63.” All of this was accomplished under the direction of Bob Lewine (Director of T.V. Programming), Sherman Marx (TV Programming Producer) and Cameron Pierce (Chief Engineer of Western Division). “55er” Electrician George Short recalled: “I was working for R.C.A., and I was sent to Disneyland to set up T.V.s for the opening. Just before opening, I was getting a T.V. set ready in the DISNEY ROOM at the RED WAGON RESTAURANT. It was a madhouse with carpet layers, wall paperers, painters, carpenters, electricians all over the place!” Since May 21st, “Dateline Disneyland” rehearsals and “Brush Ups”were underway (though “virtually at a standstill” so as to not interfere with the ongoing construction workers).\n\nInvitational Press Preview Day - Finally, a year and a day after groundbreaking, Disneyland would open for the first time. Twenty-two attractions in five lands, spread across some of the 74 acres would debut to their first guests. John Gray, “Jim was so busy he didn't have time to see the Park until opening day. ‘It was fantastic.’ he said. ‘Everything was done, complete to grass and flowers.’”\n\nIn Walt Disney Productions Inter-Office Communications, Walt Disney issued the following announcement about the “Disneyland Premier” to Studio Personnel : “Many of you have been intimately associated with the creation of Disneyland, and now that it is about to become a reality, I want you and yours to join with us in the thrill of its opening. On Sunday afternoon, July 17th, the gates of Disneyland will open for the first time at 2:30 P.M. with the invitational tv premier to be staged on ABC network from 4:30 to 6:00 P.M. We invite you to be part of this inaugural ceremony and we are enclosing tickets and instructions for you and your family. We do hope that you can be with us.” Jack Lindquist recalled “I was at Disneyland on the opening day, totally thrilled to be able to be there with my family. It was a really hot day in July and the freeway wasn’t completed. When we got there, the parking lot was packed, but we finally got parked. We went up to the gate and the tickets I had were for 1:00 so you had to wait outside until 1:00. There had to be 20,000 people in the park that day,” according to “Homecoming - Destination Disneyland” by Carlene Thie.\n\nRonald Reagan (the future President of the United States) was not just in attendance, but a Participant host of the ceremonious broadcast. Also in attendance were serving civil government officials, as California Governor Goodwin J. Knight, “Lieutenant Governor Powers, Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan, Representative James B. Utt, Anaheim Mayor Charles Pearson and the mayors and councilmen of all Orange County cities, Mayor Norris Poulson of Los Angeles and Mayor George Vermillion of Long Beach, and California Senator Thomas Kuchel,” according to The Disneyland News (Vol.1, No.1 ; published July of 1955). “Other personal guests of Disney were the public officials of Anaheim, members of Los Angeles and Long Beach Chambers of Commerce, leaders of industry in Anaheim, members of the Chamber of Commerce of Anaheim and each city in Orange County cities, the clergy of all churches and denominations in Orange County, and the Orange County Board of Supervisors.” Officials even flew in from other states, like Governor Frank Clements of Tennessee who remarked to The Daily Oklahoman: “After your Davy Crockett film I feel like a part of this place.”\n\nAlso in attendance were representatives from Colliers, Life, Newsweek, Reader’s Digest, Time, The Wall Street Journal, and more than 1,000 members of the world-wide press, including United Press International, Associated Press, and at least 104 foreign correspondents. These were given special Press Passes included inside packets of instructional information. In addition, these were encouraged to attach special windshield stickers to their automobile (in order to expedite their “car through traffic to the vicinity of Disneyland”), and to “bring the inclosed Press Invitation Pass” with them on Sunday, July 17th. Among these members of the “world-wide press” were “foreign consuls…national magazine and newspaper editors and reporters, lessees and exhibitors from the Park itself, and local business, service club and Los Angeles and Orange County officials”. Joining them were “many of Hollywood’s most celebrated personalities and other distinguished guests,” according to “The Disneyland Diary”. The Disneyland News (Vol.1, No.1) preserves the names of some of the “luminaries from motion pictures, television and the theatre” who were present : Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Debbie Reynolds, “Danny Thomas, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, Art Linkletter, Irene Dunne, Jeff Chandler, Eve Arden, Marilyn Maxwell, Donald O’Connor, George Gobel, Margaret Whiting, Gale Storm, Ed Wynn and Charleston Heston, and the families and children of many of these and other stars.” A contributing writer for The Daily Oklahoman even spotted George ‘Superman’ Reeves among the audience. Many more individuals were invited, including 500 local school children who arrived via 14 school busses. Tom Roppa recalled “There was a bunch of people from Italy in the Park and I had to interpret for them.” While most of the world could not join these ones in-person, it is estimated that the largest television audience to date of some 90 million were tuned in.\n\nRay Van De Warker started working with Bob Penfield: “I remember that we were told to come in each day and to meet at the Castle. That was before opening day and the only cool place was in the Castle's archway. We were supposed to learn how to operate the attractions, but they were never made ready until an hour and a half before the opening.”\n\nWhile one Nash Airflyte Magazine article (published for July, 1955) promised a “formal debut scheduled to outstrip in glamour any premier ever staged in Hollywood,” “almost everyone warned us that Disneyland would be a Hollywood spectacular - a spectacular failure,” by Walt’s own words. When the big opening day came, everything that could go wrong, occurred. “Walt… confided to a reporter that he had almost missed the Park’s spectacular debut. Exhausted, he had gone to bed in his tiny apartment above the Firehouse to try for a few hour’s sleep. Because people kept waking him up with problems, he finally locked his door, only to find that later in the morning he couldn’t get the door open. In desperation, Walt finally had to yell for help.” [Disneyland 25 “Happy Birthday to a Dream” Advertising Supplement; published January 20, 1980] Later, Walt would state: “I function better when things are going badly than when they’re as smooth as whipped cream.” This could be seen in how Walt composed himself on camera and off camera on Press Preview Day.\n\nWalt was soon seen greeting arrivals in light blue slacks, white shirt with red polka dots and Tahitian straw hat. By one account, “He seemed satisfied as he surveyed his realm, even though it still needs a few finishing touches.“ “It Was a Nip and Tuck, But We Made It.” Walt Disney made the preceding statement to The Daily Oklahoman. That was because the Park was still unfinished by many accounts - “piles of lumber were here and there, trees that had died had been repainted green, instead of watered.” By another account, “The park was a scene of frenetic activity with painters still painting, carpenters hammering away, trees being planted and seats being installed… Disney confided to Joe Fowler, who managed construction of the Park, that he ordered reams of decorative bunting to ‘cover up what isn’t ready.’” [Disneyland 25 “Happy Birthday to a Dream” Advertising Supplement; published January 20, 1980] Hank Dains recalled the day was “Hectic..that's the word. We worked all day and night before opening. And just as the T.V. crew was coming into Tomorrowland, we were finishing the last of the awnings.” Bob Mills recalled: “As the guests were coming in the FRONT door, we were going out the BACK door to the boneyard with EVERYTHING that wasn't nailed down! The boneyard was a gigantic sea of junk!”\n\nThe food locations ran out of food and drinks. Some journalists accused Walt of withholding water so that more soda could be sold in the Park.\n\nA plumbers strike had caused Walt to choose between operable drinking fountains or restrooms, resulting in Cast Members carrying water on their backs for the first day of operation (and sometime after). Dick Galentine recalled “there was hardly any water!” Disneylander and “55er” Boyd Diaz still recalled “Opening day was like a madhouse!… there were not enough bathrooms,” while John Catone remembered “very few toilet facilities were ready. Roy Disney said, gently, that HE ‘didn't mind if the people urinated in the bushes!’”\n\n“55er” Joyce Belanger recalled: “Every time I looked around, Ronald Reagan was taking his ‘contacts’ out!” Art Linkletter referred to the frenetic telecast (where “cues were missed, [and] cameras came on unexpectedly”), “like filming three volcanoes going off at the same time, and not expecting any of them.” “55er” Cora Lee Sargent recalled: “Bob Cummings stopped and talked to me and I wasn't any good for three hours after that!” Gunter Otto recalled: “I remember on Opening Day, I was to turn on sprinklers at a signal given by a television director. He gave a wrong signal and I turned on the sprinklers just as Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen came riding out of the Living Desert. they got soaking wet and I was sure that I'd get fired for that one!”\n\nEven worse - the Park wasn’t prepared for 18,000 Guests (despite its then-maximum guest capacity figure of 10,000; or “40,000” according to Nash Airflyte Magazine, July 1955). Maynard Swenson recalled that “Cars were backed up down Manchester for miles as the freeway was not finished.” So imagine what happened when some 25,000 additional un-invited guests stormed the gates of the Magic Kingdom, compounding the total of guests to 28,154 by mid-afternoon, many with counterfeit tickets. (according to “The Disneyland Diary”)! As a sidelight, Richard Nunis commented: “Someone forgot to count the tickets and we'll never know what the count really was!”\n\nMany of us have heard the tale! The area weather reached a recorded high of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Bob Penfield recalled: “There was NO SHADE, and portable coolers were placed in the waiting lines.” Jim Harman remembered ”the black top was so hot that you could hardly walk on it!” Dick Nunez remembered that women were “walking out of their shoes” because workers had“just finished laying the asphalt from the Castle down to the Main Gate before opening the gates, and the new asphalt (aided by hot weather) caused women’s high heels to sink into the hot asphalt.” Yale Forklifts (carrying cameras atop platforms) were also getting their wheels lodged in the freshly-laid asphalt.\n\nAll of the 29 remote cameras could not catch all of the chaos that would ensue that day. Jack Lindquist’s only memory of Opening Day involved his son riding only one attraction (the Canal Boats), which subsequently broke down and took Disneylanders 55 minutes to pull back to the dock. Some Ride Operators (as those assigned to Peter Pan) had only trained (for the first time) just two hours before opening. Marion Schawacha recalled opening day: “Hectic! Painters still painting, carpenters still sawing! The waiting lines were all mixed up and criss-crossing each other. The line from Autopia would end up at the Space Bar, and vice versa. All you could see in Tomorrowland was PEOPLE!… The guy who was supposed to be the manager almost blew the place up. He turned the gas on for the big oven and then went down the corridor to get a match. BOOM!” George Mills recalled: “At night in the Castle courtyard, you could see a little blue flame, where a gas main had never been capped!..some PIXIE DUST!” Owning to all this, many still refer to July 17, 1955 as “Black Sunday” and the day's events played out like one of the Goofy animated shorts - anything that could have gone wrong, did.\n\nStill, the Grand Opening wasn’t all bad memories. Earl Wuestneck recalled: “What a day! People... People...People! We would open the gates for 20 minutes and then close for 20 minutes. Celebrities everywhere…miles of film taken. I wore a little military hat on the side of my head, a gold ‘IKE’ jacket, green pants, brown shoes and white gloves!” Ron Dominguez (who was one of the original residents of the property where Disneyland now stands, and 1 of some 600 original Disneylanders) remembered “I was a Ticket Taker. Opening day was a hectic day. The plan was to invite people at different hours so that we could spread out all the arrivals. But it didn’t work out that way. Everyone wanted to come out early to see the stars. It was exciting. Having grown up here, to see this new thing that no one was really too sure about finally open, there was a lot of excitement. Celebrities came in through the front gate, which was impressive to have them come to our hometown.” (Disneyland LINE, Vol.25, No.28, published July 16th, 1993)\n\nThe television show (aimed at some 90 million viewers) had been planned an entire year in advance. Many Americans would watch the premier from their own homes including Walt’s nephew Teddy Beecher, whose mother abhorred large crowds, declined Walt’s invitation, and purchased a new television for the event. A rehearsal had been held early on opening day, with the invitational tv premier to be telecast as a news event on ABC-TV Network from 4:30 to 6:00 P.M. PDT. It was during that time (timed to coincide with with the largest projected television audience), that all activity on Main Street ceased as special “formal dedication ceremonies” took place at the Park.\n\nGuests were encouraged to arrive before 4:15 P.M. because Disneyland's gates would close from 4:20 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. At that time, Horseless Carriages (used to transport celebrities and other distinguished guests) lined parts of Town Square. After three “chaplains” (representing Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths) participated in opening dedication ceremonies. After Walt Disney stepped forward to read the Dedication of Disneyland, and a brief speech by Reverend Glenn D. Puder, a “Military Chaplain representing various creeds” (and Walt Disney’s nephew) which was followed by a subsequent moment of silence for prayer. Next, California Governor Goodwin Knight addressed the masses as he dedicated “a wonderful place for children and grownups alike.”The San Diego Marine Band performed the National Anthem, while the “Star Spangled Banner” was raised formally over Town Square. After a moment of silence, a total of 80 jet planes of the 146th Fighter Interceptor Wing of the California Air National Guard soared overhead, and 500 homing pigeons “fluttered out of the clock [over Main Street Station] as a salute to peace.” After the Press Preview day Parade, and another dedication in Frontierland, more than 100 Eagle Scouts (“citizens of the future”) helped raise the 48 flags of the forty eight states over Tomorrowland. Then, pigeons imported from Seattle were released at the opening of Tomorrowland. For these reasons (and more), “during the telecast, Disneyland’s admission gates” were “temporarily closed between the hours of 4:20 and 5:30 P.M.” Portions of the audience in attendance were televised. The Disneyland Public Relations Department announced in Press Releases : “Disneyland’s guides and attendants will clear certain areas of Disneyland in preparation for these ceremonies.”\n\nReporter Henry McLemore was present on the evening of July 17th, recalling: “when I finally made my way out of the place the street sweepers had gone to work and Disneyland was about to close for the night.” After all the ceremonies, the Main gates closed at 7:15 P.M., while Disneyland (and its 18 attractions) remained open until 8:00 P.M. on Sunday evening, July 17th. This was to prepare the Park (and its 850 to 1000 hosts) for the big Public Opening at 10:00 A.M. on July the 18th.\n\nDisneyland Grand Opening - July 18, 1955, a truck belonging to the County of Orange Police Communications Division was on site at Disneyland. Approximately 15,000 Guests (each of them Very Important Persons) waited the opening of Walt Disney’s Disneyland, proving that they “had started something!” Walt was on hand to greet the first visitors to enter Disneyland - Christine Vess (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (age 7) and three other guests.\n\nMig Lyles was not present for the Press Preview but remembers: “The next day I started to work and I was a relief girl all over the Park. It was rather frightening as there was no training. One time when I had been working in Fantasyland, I was suddenly sent to the Main Gate...where I had NEVER BEEN...scary!”\n\nOn July 18th, 1955, quite a few newspapers carried pessimistic headlines: “Disneyland Opens Amid Confusion,” “Walt’s Dream a Nightmare,” and “Park Can’t Handle Opening Day Crush,” among others.\n\n1955 : Despite pre-opening day predictions of (an average of 15,000 persons daily ; a peak of 60,000 on holidays and weekends), the “average daily attendance in August…was 20,000,” according to “A Report To Disneyland Lessees,” Summer ‘68. But after 52 days (that is, just seven weeks, or less than two months) of Park operation, the 1 millionth visitor (five-year-old Los Angeles resident Elsa Bertha Marquez) passed though the Disneyland Main Gate on September 8th, 1955, at 2:31 p.m.! According to one newspaper report, “suspense mounted as word went around that the millionth guest was due momentarily… The Disneyland band formed at the gate, playing ‘Happy Days Are Here Again,’ and cameras flashed to catch the lucky person. Completely unaware of what was happening the Marquez family was stopped at the turnstile by Customer Relations Director Jack Sayers, who greeted them on behalf of Disneyland and led them through the gate. The band then struck up ‘Happy Days Are Here Again,’ and Elsa and her little brother, Daniel, 3, led them in ‘Davy Crockett’ and ‘Let Me Call You Sweetheart.’ When they arrived at Disneyland City Hall, Sayers introduced the Marquez family to Sheriff Bill Lacy of Frontierland, Chief Shooting Star of the Indian Village in Frontierland ; TWA hostess, Jo Ann Weidman ; and K-7 John Catone, the ‘Spaceman’ of Tomorrowland. Following the public announcement and introductions at City Hall, Elsa was showered with gifts from Disneyland and Disneyland exhibitors. They were guests of the park for all rides and dinner at the Red Wagon Inn.”\n\nAccording to Van Arsadle France, one reason for the July 17th opening date was that Walt and company may have planned to capitalize on the summer tourist season. Studies recorded in Disneyland Fact Sheets (included in Press Kits), projected 5,000,000 visitors during the first year. Western Magazine (and other journals) recognized that the attendance figures were staggering, stating : “Millions of people visit our national parks, mountains, rivers, and lakes every year. But nature now has competition from man, for Walt Disney’s new venture, known as Disneyland, threatens to draw more adults and children to its portals than even the famous Grand Canyon, or the geysers of Yellowstone Park.”\n\nBefore Disneyland opened, millions of Americans, read and heard about the magic kingdom of Disneyland and awaited its opening in mid-summer. Now visitors came from all over the globe and continued to come at the rate of 20,000 a day, one quarter more than Disney's most optimistic guess. For instance, on July 28, Disneyland received a visit by Cal Farley (of Texas) and his group of 200 Boys Ranchers (comprised of boys from 42 different states and three foreign countries).\n\nThis trend of visitors continued and Disneyland welcomed its one-millionth guest on September 8, 1955. Through September, 1.2 million guests visited Disneyland. Actual Park Attendance for the first 37 weeks, from July 18, 1955 to April 1, 1956 (as published in the “First Annual Report To Disneyland Lessees”) was tallied at 2,167,000. The same report forecast an estimation of the Total First Year Park Attendance at 3,957,000. Their figures were not far off. By reports, some 1,170,972 guests had both paid and stepped through the turnstiles in 1955 and by the end of the Park’s first full fiscal year (by September 30, 1956) Park attendance had reached whopping 3,799,804 (*or, “3,317,320,” according to the “1969 Disneyland Wallet Fact Card,” or “3,731,942” by other sanctioned sources). By comparison, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon National Parks drew about 3.6 million during 1955. Far from being a “spectacular failure,” Disneyland quickly became one of the Southland’s top tourist attractions, and did reach that projected 5,000,000 (mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph), but not until 14 and-a-half moths later. All of this thanks to the some 600 cast Members on the Disneyland payroll during the first year.\n\nAccording to nine opinion polls (of 700 guests per sampling) conducted between August 1955 and March 1956, approximately 64.2 visitors lived in California. During this same first fiscal year, the very same reports on Park activities disclosed of these figures, that “adults outnumber children by a ratio of four to one.” Among those notable “adult” visitors during the first few weeks were Disneyland’s first visitors (Christine Vess Watkins & Michael Schwartner), and Dave MacPherson of Long Beach (the first guest to purchase a ticket on Monday, July 18th, 1955). “Since the park’s mid-July opening, celebrities by the hundreds have flocked here to form an imposing list that reads like a roster of filmland’s famous,” according to “The Disneyland News” (March 10, 1956 ; Vol. 1 No. 9). Among these were Eddie Fischer, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hersholt, several Miss Universe candidates (including Miss U.S.A. Carlene King Johnson of Vermont, Miss California Donna Schorr, Miss Japan and Miss Italy), movie star John Derek and his family, Bennie Goodman, Marilyn Maxwell, Lana Turner, Irene Dunne, Dale Evans, Gale Storm (and her two boys), Danny Thomas (and his family), Art Linkletter (who had visited several times, i.e. October 15th), Joseph Cotton, Ronald Reagan, Robert Cummings, Kirk Douglas, George Goebel, Frank Sinatra, Walter Pigeon, Jerry Colona, Buddy Baer, Don De Fore, Roy Rogers, Eddie Albert, Fess Parker, Buddy Ebsen, Dick Haymes (and his wife Rita Hayworth, and family), United States Vice President Richard M. Nixon (as well as his wife Patricia, daughters Tricia & Julie, and a nephew), in July. Milton Berle and Jerry Lewis visited Disneyland on the same day in August. Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) visited on September 23rd. Terry Moore visited in November. Other visitors of Disneyland’s first year included more of the world’s famous film stars like Donna Reed, Fred Waring, Rita Hayworth, Shirley Temple, Dick Powell and June Allyson, Esther Williams and Ben Gage, Groucho Marx, Edgar Bergen. [“Disneyland 1st Anniversary Souvenir Pictorial”, 1956] The Disneyland News mentioned briefly that the “Queen Mother Farouk of Egypt” visited in a party which included the Consul of Mexico. Hank Greenberg (Cleveland Indians General Manager) and Bill Veeck (baseball’s “Mr. Ambassador”) visited Disneyland together, Greenberg promising to take the entire team to Disneyland if they won the league championship. Many children and their parents turned out for “Kids’ Day and Keller Animal Show” (on September 24th). These facts and figures are all very impressive, considering that some predicted Walt Disney’s Disneyland to fail!\n\nAs a final “sidelight,” Disneyland would close on Mondays (from September of 1955 to June 11, 1956, which was the last Monday the park closed). This was “to give workmen and exhibitors opportunity for necessary maintenance operations,” according to “The Disneyland News” (Vol. 1, No. 12 ; June of 1956). Despite this new schedule of operation, even a few special events were held at Disneyland : “Save The Horse Week,” observed October 16th ; “Navy Day,” observed October 27th; the Mickey Mouse Club Circus and first Holiday Festival (beginning November 24th); the first Thanksgiving Day parade, held November 27th); Model Clubs meeting at Tomorrowland (December 1st).\n\nBy the Fall of 1955, Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom was “originating from Disneyland as a new daily radio program over the ABC radio network.” This marked Disney's third regular production for the American Broadcasting Company and was “designed as a morning audience participation series of general appeal.”\n\nThe first Disneyland Ticket Book Plan was initiated as a new kind of admission plan offering up to 50 per cent savings with tickets good for any attraction. The “Disneyland Day” Ticket Book Plan was extended to benefit guests, according to “The Disneyland News,” (published for December 10th, 1955).\n\nMany special exhibits included Stuffy the World’s Smallest Mouse who appeared on an episode of The Mickey Mouse Club and temporality made his home at Disneyland (according to The Disneyland News, August 1955).\n\nThese attracted Visitors from all over the globe who continued to come at the rate of 20,000 a day, one quarter more than Disney's most optimistic guess.\n\nThese drew in many notable visitors among its audience. Of these, Jerry Mathers and his family (in early January), Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (on January 23rd), Baron and Baroness Rothschild (on February 4th), the DuPonts (on February 5th), Boris Karloff (on February 25th), June Lockhart (on March 29th), King Hussein of Jordan (April 4th), Dr. Norman Vincent Peal (on April 4th), Rosemary Clooney (April 17th), King Baudoin of Belgium (on May 20th), Former Vice President Nixon and his family (in June), President Zacarno of Indonesia (on June 2nd), Meredith Wilson led the “76 Trombones” (in June), Governor Edmund G. “Pat” Brown (on June 4th), Dr. Ralph Bunche of the United Nations (on June 17th), Prime Minister Suhrawardy of Pakistan (in July), Andre Kostelanetz (on July 28th), Esther Williams (on August 3rd), Steve Allen (on August 10th), Lucille Ball (on August 12th-13th), Karl Malden (on August 21st), Dinah Shore (on September 2nd), Crown Prince Asfa Woosen of Ethiopia (in October), Prime Minister Moulay Abdullah Ibrahim of Morocco (in October), Russian Nuclear Physicists (on October 24th), Asfa Woosen - Crown Prince of Ethiopia (on October 29th), both Senator John F. Kennedy and President Sekou Toure of the Republic of Guinea in North Africa (who shook hands on the steps of Disneyland City Hall on November 1, 1959 *though some later publications state October), Herman Levan Producer of My Fair Lady (on November 21st), Bob Cummings and Eva Saint Marie (November 27th), former President Harry S. Truman (in November), King Mohammed of Morocco (in December), Ted Mack (on December 6th), and Arthur Miller the playwrite (on December 30th).\n\n“The ‘Almost-Visitor’ of 1959”\n\nThe Disneyland Dictionary makes mention of an ‘Almost Visitor.’ We are referring to the Soviet Premier of Russia Nikita Khrushchev and his wife who had planned to visit Disneyland, on an American Tour during September 19, 1959 (*one sanctioned “Disneyland Diary” incorrectly states 1960). The two were denied entrance by the State Department due to tensions of the period and resulting security reasons, which led to Disneyland becoming “the center of a cause célèbre.” Up to this point, millions of Disneyland Guests had been treated like kings, including Kings, Queens, Presidents and other famous people. According to Fletcher Markle (in interview with Walt Disney, in 1963), “there was only one adult who was ever refused permission to the Park.” The Disneyland Diary highlighted this incident the following way : “In September Chairman Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union expressed a desire to visit the Park but his request was denied by U.S. government officials, sparking an international ‘incident.’”\n\nSometime after, “Mrs. Khrushchev told Frank Sinatra that ‘Disneyland is the only place I wanted to see here.’ The famous headline ‘Khrushchev Irked: Can’t Go To Disneyland’ came about when he stormed at an audience of stars and dignitaries from politics and the corporate world. ‘Is this a nation of gangsters? Why can’t I go to Disneyland?’” [“The Spirit of Disneyland,” page 46; prepared 1984 by Walt Disney Productions] This incident soon made news, and several notable individuals responded. “Author Herman Wouk wrote a letter: ‘I don’t blame Khrushchev for jumping up and down in rage over missing Disneyland. There are few things worth seeing in the United States, or indeed anywhere in the world.’ … Bob Hope quipped, ‘Here we are in Alaska - that’s halfway between Khrushchev and Disneyland.’ … And in New York City the day following the Soviet Premier’s complaint, an officer of one of capitalism’s largest brokerage houses picked uo his telephone and called a Disney executive. ‘Maybe you don’t remember me,’ the man said. ‘I’m the one who said we didn’t finance ‘kiddy lands’ when you were looking for money to build Disneyland back in 1953. Now I’d like to come out and see your place. If Khrushchev can get so mad about not seeing it, I’m afraid I must have been very wrong. Disneyland can’t be much of a ‘kiddyland!’”\n\nHowever, Walt remembered: “No, we didn’t refuse him permission. No, we were all set. You see, we work according to what the State Department wants to do. They come and they have guests… a guest of the government. So, we were ready to receive Khruschev. But, it so happened that the security problem here in Los Angeles (because actually Disneyland is in another town), and our Chief of Police, he had quite a chore there… He just was a little worried about somebody (maybe) walking in Disneyland with a shopping bag, and what they might have in it, you’d never be able to know. We were ready for him. The Press was ready. The State Department Security… They were all set, and I was all ready. In fact, we’ve had a lot of dignitaries down there, and he was one that Mrs. Disney wanted to go down and meet - Mr. Khruschev.” This was in step with contemporaneous Disneyland policies to “face the fact that we all have our prejudices, but we bury these outside the berm, and in the Magic Kingdom we treat EVERYONE like a king, regardless of his color, creed, politics, or condition of financial solvency.”\n\nNot long after, Drew Pearson made numerous references to the incident in the “Gala Day at Disneyland” Exhibitor’s Campaign Book:\n\n“After Nikita Khrushchev put up such a wail over having been barred from Disneyland, I decided to take another look at this famous playground which Walt Disney has carved out of an old orange grove just outside Los Angeles. Actually I didn't really need Khrushchev as an excuse, because my three California grandsons were itching to go.\n\nAnyway, we went--and I really can't blame Khrushchev for being disappointed. I also suspect that the State Department and the Los Angeles police made their biggest mistake in barring him from this fairyland. He probably would have borrowed Walt Disney to set up a similar children's paradise in Moscow; which would have been very healthy, because nations which put children first think twice before they fight.\n\nHere is a firsthand report:\n\nSUBMERGED IN ONE of Disney's ‘atomic’ submarines. They look like the real thing. You peer through portholes at sharks, shell-fish, even mermaids, a chest of gold spilling out from a wreck which the pirates sank in the days of the Spanish Main. Very realistic. It revealed no atomic secrets, Mr. K. but you would have loved it.\n\nTobogganed down Mount Matterhorn. This has all the thrill of a Coney Island shoot-the-chute, only more scenic. You shoot through the inside of a mountain, then down the outside, ride under the spray of a 50-foot waterfall, watch live Swiss mountain climbers scaling the peak.\n\nRODE THE MONORAIL streamliner which circles breathlessly over thousands of people with several score passengers. It is old hat to Europeans. The Germans invented it. But if Washington, D.C. was not asleep at the switch it would use the monorail instead of tearing up acres and acres of historic streets designed by l'Enfant in George Washington's day. Other cities cond use it to carry passengers out to distant outlying airports.\n\nAbout 3,800 people staff Disneyland in the peak summer months, many of them college professors, high school teachers and college students. One school principal who put my youngsters into the miniature auto races has been working there four years. He works week ends in the winter.\n\nYOU WOULD HAVE GOT QUITE A KICK out of Jungleland, Mr. K. The jungle guide steers a boat through tropical waters with orchids and jungle mist dripping over your head. A hippo comes up under the boat. The guide shoots him. An alligator teaches its baby how to swim. A python is in a tree overhead. Two giant gorillas roar as the boat passes, a lion jumps on a zebra, an elephant lunges at the boat. My 5-year-old grandson had his heart in his mouth- even though he knew the animals were made of plastic and were mechanized to lunge and roar at every boat passing through those jungle waters.\n\nALL SORTS OF PEOPLE come to Disneyland - from Harry Truman, to the Crown Prince of Ethiopia, to French Ambassador Herve Alphand, to the men of the Brazilian navy, who were much in evidence when we were there. On your next trip to the U.S.A, we hope the Los Angeles police will let you come, Mr. K. You'll enjoy every bit of it.\n\nA lot of Americans liked the fact that you brought your children over to see us, Mr. K, and we know you'll enjoy President Eisenhower's grandchildren. If we could just leave things to the kids, there wouldn't be any more wars.\n\nSo I hope next time you come you'll see American children - and some who aren't children any more but still like to be young relax at Disneyland.”\n\n1960 : After all that transpired during 1959, it’s hard to believe that the year 1960, was as eventful for Disneyland!\n\n1966: At a Walt Disney Productions Stockholders meeting (held on February 1, 1966) focused on growth, “Mr. Tatum pointed out - 50% of all visitors to Disneyland return later to see the Park’s new attractions.” Next, a need for an increased guest capacity was stressed, by “more facilities - rides, attractions, food and merchandising, to handle properly and efficiently our ever increasing guests.” Further, “About one-half of the Disneyland guests were California residents… one out of every six California residents visited Disneyland last year (1965), and one of two, or one-half of all the visitors to the State visited Disneyland.” In 1966, many special events brought guests to Disneyland, like the New Year’s Eve Party (which attracted 18,000 guests). February 14th, 1966 brought the First Valentine Dance to Disneyland.\n\nOn April 23rd, 1966, the very first “Angels Family Fun Day” was presented by the Magic Kingdom Club. The Pre-Game Extravaganza began at 10:00 a.m. with pageantry, bands, and surprises. The Disney Characters and Walt Disney appeared in-person, kicking off the Angels Vs. the Minnesota Twins game at 11 a.m. Angels Family Fun Packs allowed guests to enjoy reserve seats for eight American League Games and the magic of Disneyland.\n\nOther special events of 1966 included Student Editor’s Day (May 7th). The Spring Fling drew 23,000 guests through the turnstiles. Youth Days also set an attendance record. Many nightly events (part of Disneyland After Dark) scheduled for the summer would also bring guests into Disneyland! These included fireworks nightly at 9 pm, Hootenanny (on Monday nights), Humdinger (on Tuesdays), Country Music Jubilee (on Wednesday nights), Guest Band Nites (on Thursday), Swingin’est Spot In The Southland (Friday through Sunday nights). Special performances by Xavier Cugat, Nelson Riddle, and Harry James entertained guests during the opening Big Band Night. The sixth edition of Dixieland at Disneyland brought “Louie Armstrong, Bob Crosby, Turk Murphy, and ‘Doc’ Souchon’s New Orleans All-Stars” to Disneyland. Other entertainers performing that night included Nellie Lutcher, the Royale Street Bachelors, the Southern California Hot Jazz Society Marching Band, the Young Men from New Orleans, and the Firehouse Five Plus Two. Disneyland saluted Medal of Honor holders (on Friday, October 14) and Private Parties held at Disneyland during 1966 included a Special NBC Party (on an unknown date).\n\nDuring one of his last interviews, Walt Disney admitted: “Well, I think that by this time my staff, my young group of executives, and everything else, are convinced that Walt is right!… That quality will out. And so I think they’re going to stay with that policy because it’s proved that it’s a good business policy. Give the people everything you can give them. Keep the place as clean as you can keep it. Keep it friendly, you know. Make it a real fun place to be. I think they’re convinced, and I think they’ll hang on after… as you say…well… after Disney.” These words were proven by the Cast Members’ response to what would soon happen. After news of Walt Disney’s death on Thursday (at 9:35 a.m.), December 15th, 1966, Walt Disney Productions issued an Inter-Office Communication to all personnel, announcing that the “studio would be closed at noon today.” According to “The Disneyland Diary,” “Disneyland and the world mourned Walt Disney’s passing on December 15th.” Ray Bradbury had previously promised his family a day at Disneyland, on Saturday, December 17, 1966. That very day, Walt was interned at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Ray Bradbury kept his promise according to his statement made to the syndicated press. According to “The Disneyland Diary,” “Roy O. Disney, President of Walt Disney Productions, pledged the continuation of Walt’s plans for the Park’s expansion, in keeping with the promise Walt Disney made on Disneyland’s Day One.”\n\nNotwithstanding how countless hearts were grieving over the loss of Walt, Disneyland Park attendance for the year was 6.7 million bringing total Park attendance to 57 million in August. Guests of note (during 1966) included the House Speaker Anwar Sadat of the United Arab Republic (in February), Mayor Mahamane Haidara of Timbuktu (in March), Prince Michael and Princess Marine of Greece (in April), Admiral Toscana of Brazil (in April), Prince Surachatra of Thailand (in April), Prince and Princess Pahlavi of Iran (in May), Prince George and Princess Anne of Denmark (in May), КМРС radio Executive Vice-president and General Manager Loyd Sigmon and G W B/S 0 members (in May), ten United States Governors (in July), Prime Minister Forbes Burnham of Guyana (in July), Sir Edmund Hillary (in August), and 275 Congressional Medal of Honor Winners (in October). It appears that both Maurice Chevalier and Carol Channing met Walt at Disneyland on the same day, likely in 1966.\n\n1967: “More than 18,000 greeted New Year’s and thousands more attended the second annual Valentine’s Dance,” according to The Disneyland Diary. Total attendance passed the 60 million mark in March when a peak “capacity” crowd gathered for “Spring Fling” during Easter Week and the Old Fashioned Easter Parade. This trend of high guest attendance numbers would continue throughout the year, and the “Summer of ‘67” broke many attendance records - daily, weekly, monthly, and annual! For instance, August 19th’s daily attendance of 87,228 was more than 6,000 above August 19th’s attendance during the previous year. The “highest daily average for any one-month period was also set in August, slightly over 52,000 for Echandi-Jimenez of the 31 days.” Then there were “383,437 in a single week…and a total for the month of 1,462,202”, according to “A Report To Disneyland Lessees, Summer ‘68”. Total summer attendance was what we call “summer magic” - 4,300,000 (600,000 more than any previous summer’s attendance). The result was that the total annual attendance from ‘67 to ‘68 was 7,937,743 (“18.4% over the previous year’s record…56.3% greater than attendance five years ago…and 108.9% above Disneyland’s first year audience in 1955”, according to “A Report To Disneyland Lessees, Summer ‘68”)!\n\n1970 : Total Park investment to date reached $128.5 million.\n\nMore than five million people visited Disneyland during its summer-long anniversary celebration. For the first time in the Park’s history, Disneyland welcomed ten million guests in a single year, bringing the total number of visitors who had been entertained at Disneyland to 95 million.
