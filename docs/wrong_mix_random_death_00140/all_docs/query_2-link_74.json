        "text": "In 1921 a little-known military officer, Reza Khan, with British support, seized power in a coup. He marched to Tehran with his Cossack Brigade and became Minister of War. Following the parliament’s deposition of the Qajar dynasty in December 1925 he was declared Reza Shah Pahlavi, thus founding the Pahlavi dynasty. In 1935 he asked foreign delegations to use the name Iran – which is the historical name of the country used by its various peoples – rather than Persia.\n\nReza Shah set out to restore order and modernize society and the economy. He reorganized the government, administration, finances, and army. Industrialization was accelerated, roads and railroads – the Trans-Iranian Railway connecting the Persian Gulf to Caspian Sea – were built. He forged cultural links abroad while ending some of the concessionary agreements with European states.\n\nMany of the Shah’s measures were designed to reduce the power of the religious hierarchy and Westernize the country. Modern education was introduced. Women were allowed to attend school. Educational reforms ended the clerics’ near monopoly on education. The Shah created a body of secular law, excluded the clerics from judgeships, and transferred the important and lucrative task of notarizing documents from the clerics to state-licensed notaries. In 1927 he introduced a dress code that required all Iranian men to wear Western-style dress and a round, peaked cap. In 1935 he banned the wearing of the veil by women."
