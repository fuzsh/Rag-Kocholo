Secondary sources proved invaluable in setting the historical context for TPAJAX, but the details of the operation itself come from classified sources. These sources are listed in the footnotes and bibliography. (U) I have also examined relevant records from the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the National Security Agency. These records were not as plentiful or as helpful as I had hoped. I was nonetheless able to fill in some gaps with documents from these organizations. The vast majority of surviving documents on the operation itself remain with CIA, but for the reasons provided below even these are not as numerrs as one might expect (S) Most of the operational files on TPAJAX, held in the Near East Division in the Directorate of Operations, were destroyed during a routine office cleaning in 1962. According to various sources, the Division needed more file space, and management told branch members to clean out their files. Much operational material was destroyed under the mistaken idea that because the operation was over, the documentary record was of no further use Witnesses have confirmed this unfortunate event. (U) Copies of cables sent between Tehran Station and Washington during the operation also were among the files the Division destroyed in its attempt to gain more filing space. At the time, the copies were already nine years old and no one thought that they were important. A record copy may have remained in the Agency's former Cable Secretariat for some time, but such records too have long since disappeared in routine house cleanings. An extensive search of CIA's archives has failed to uncover any surviving copies. (U) Some transcripts of Station cables nonetheless survive because CIA had some of the cables microfilmed. I have been unable to determine when. In the late 1970s or iv TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET early 1980s, CIA's History Staff prepared transcripts of these documents and sent them to the Department of State's Office of the Historian, then researching a volume of the Foreign Relations of the United States series. There is every reason to believe that these transcripts, produced under the supervision of a professional historian, are authentic. The matters in the transcripts correspond in sequence and subject with events as we know them. (U) The microfilm itself apparently has been destroyed, in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) guidelines. According to NARA, the microfilm had to be kept for 20 years and then could be destroyed. The record of destruction had to be kept for five years, at which point it too could be destroyed. (S) CIA is not the only organization that' has destroyed records relevant to TPAJAX. The State Department has destroyed three quarters of the records for the relevant time period belonging to the Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs (GTI) of State's Bureau of Near Eastern , South Asian, and African Affairs. These materials were in GTI files, Lot 57, D 529. According to State's Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952-1954, Vol. X, Iran, 1951-54, the documents covered \"political and military matters and US economic and military assistance to Iran for the years 1946-1954.\" (S) The present study It examines some of the issues currently occupying scholars: Why did the United States act against Mossadeq? Would Mossadeq's government have fallen even if the United States had done nothing? I have also exploited records of government agencies other than CIA, Finally, I have addressed the relationship between the operators in CIA's thenï¿½Directorate of Plans (now the Directorate of Operations) and the analysts in the Directorate of Intelligence, a missing dimension in all published histories. (U) Some readers may think that this study is over-classified, but many of the crucial documents are still top secret after almost 50 years. Since this handful of documents contains information critical to the story, I have decided to use the material they contain even if it means restricting the potential readership. Scott A.

TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET Chapter 1 (S) The Roots of TPAJAX (U) Iran and the United States to 1951 (U) During the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, Washington considered the Middle East in general and Iran in particular to be among the great strategic prizes in the geopolitical and ideological struggle against the Soviet Union. It was not always so. For almost 175 years, American policymakers ignored Iran because they had no reason to do otherwise. (U) That changed during World War 11 and the immediate postwar years. During the war, Iran was an important route for American aid to the Soviet Army, engaged in a lifeï¿½orï¿½death struggle with Hitler's Wehrmacht. I Soviet troops remained in northern Iran immediately after the war, encouraging pro-Communist separatist regimes in Iranian Azerbaijan and in the Kurdish region. For a time it appeared to Washington that Moscow would demand the \"unification\" of Iranian Azerbaijan with Soviet Azerbaijan, but this problem evaporated once Stalin understood that the United States would not permit such an aggressive move.2 (U) The United States would have preferred to withdraw from the Persian Gulf after the end of World War II, but the postwar British retreat and retrenchment \"East of Suez\" created a vacuum that the US felt obligated to fill. After London announced that it could no longer supply military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey, President Harry Truman publicly declared in March 1947 that the United States would support free peoples everywhere, \"resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside 1(U) Eventually, almost a quarter of American aid for the Soviet Union came through Iran. Convoys using more northern routes lost about 20% of their cargoes to the Nazis; only 8% of cargoes sent to the Persian Gulf for shipment through Iran were lost. See, Gerhard L. Weinberg, A World At Arms: A Global History of World War II (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), pp. 284, 404. 2(U) See, Daniel Yergin, Shattered Peace: The Origins of the Cold War and the National Security State (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977); Adam B.

(U) For the first three years after President Truman's declaration, the United States paid relatively little attention to Iran even though that oil-rich country was experiencing serious economic problems, widespread discontent with the government, and growing agitation by the Tudehï¿½Iran's Communist Party. (S) In April 1950, the Director of Central Intelligence, RAdm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, drew Secretary of State Dean Acheson's attention to \"the urgent need for additional intelligence coverage of Iran.\" Hillenkoetter wrote that CIA was unable to draft reliable national intelligence estimates on the country because it simply did not have enough information. All the Agency could do, according to the DCI , was \"tell US policy makers that some sort of crisis does exist, but [CIA] cannot confidently answer such specific pertinent questions as : (1) how serious the situation actually is; (2) how adequate are Iran's own resources for meeting its present difficulties; and (3) how capable the Iranian Government is of using these resources.\"4 (S) Hillenkoetter proposed two solutions. Either existing facilities could be expanded to seek information from more diverse sources or \"coverage might be expanded through the establishment of a consulate in the strategically important southwestern part of Iran.\"5 (S) The records do not contain Acheson's reaction to Hillenkoetter's letter, but the still-classified copy in the National Archives has three handwritten notes attached to it. The first is from Fisher Howe, Deputy Special Assistant to the Secretary of State, forwarding the letter to John D. Jernegan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs. The second is from Jernegan to C. Vaughan Ferguson, Officer in Charge of Iranian Affairs, Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs. The final is from Ferguson to Jernegan.6 (S) Howe thought Hillenkoetter's letter was largely for the record, \"to show that CIA is fulfilling its overall responsibility for calling attention to weaknesses in intelligence coverage.\" Jernegan whether State should adopt CIA's The State Department clearly did not view the paucity of intelligence on Iran with the same urgency as CIA. (U) Even without the most basic intelligence on Iran, two elements drove American foreign policy in the post-war Persian Gulf region: oil and the fear that political instability might jeopardize Western access to oil.

In January 1951, nine months after Hillenkoetter's letter to Acheson, the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of National Estimates (ONE) wrote that the British economy would suffer if it lost Iranian oil. The loss of all Middle Eastern oil, ONE said, would have profound and farï¿½reaching consequences for the economies of the Western bloc.9 (U) Political instability in Gulf reon the continuing surely of oil to the West. Before the Cold War, the domestic politics of what later came to be called the Third World had made no impact on American foreign policy decisionmaking. During the Cold War, Washington could not afford the luxury of indifference because doing so would spur Soviet intrigue. Domestic politics almost anywhere abroadï¿½and especially in strategically valuable areasï¿½became important arenas for the international ideological struggle between East and West. Washington was determined to win this struggle through policies promoting longï¿½term democratization. The result, American officials hoped, would be stabilityï¿½and victory. (U) Twisting the British Lion's Tail: Mohammed Mossadeq Nationalizes the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company (U) An Islamic fundamentalist assassinated Iranian Prime Minister General Ali Razmara on 7 March 1951.11 Razmara's death set in motion a series of events that were to bring American and British officials face to face with Mohammed Mossadeq, one of the most mercurial, maddening, adroit, and provocative leaders with whom they had ever dealt.12 8(U) One of the reasons the British Government eventually took over D'Arcy's concession when he ran into financial difficulties was to ensure a secure supply of oil for the Royal Navy. See, Daniel Yergin, The Prize: the Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991), pp. 137, 140-42, 151. 9(U) N1E-14, 8 January 1951, The Importance of Iranian and Middle East Oil to Western Europe Under Peacetime Conditions, pp. 1-2. CIA estimated that if all Middle Eastern oil were lost, the non-Soviet world would have to impose an immediate and mandatory 10% cutback in consumption. In that event, the United States would have to implement rationing even though domestic broduction in those days met its own needs. 11(u) A member of the Fadayane Islam underground organization assassinated Razmara. 12(U) See Appendix D for a biographical sketch of Mohammed Mossadeq. 3 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (S) Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlaviï¿½who had become Shah when his father, Reza Shah, abdicated in 1941ï¿½appointed Mossadeq as Prime Minister on 29 April 1951. Shah's initial choice to succeed Razmara, Hussein Ala, had resigned after only a few weeks. Severe economic and political problems awaited the Mossadeq, and it was not obvious that he had the skill to solve them. In a Special Estimate prepared one month after he took office, CIA's Office of National Estimates (ONE) characterized Mossadeq as an \"impractical visionary and a poor administrator,\" but in a strong political position that was unlikely to deteriorate in the foreseeable future.13 (U) Mossadeq's immediate concern was a struggle for control of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). By 1950 the British oil concession in Iran, which the Shah had renewed in 1949, was a sore point in relations between the two countries. In March 1951, when Mossadeq was a member of the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament), he submitted a bill, which the Majlis quickly passed, nationalizing AIOC. He signed the bill into law on 1 May 1951, just three days after the Shah appointed him Prime Minister. Nationalization went into effect on 2 May 1951 and was made retroactive to 20 March 1951 (U) AIOC's nationalization brought Mossadeq and Iran into immediate conflict with Britain. The British government owned half of AIOC's stock and did not intend to let Mossadeq nationalize its assets without adequate compensation as required under international law.I4 (U) Britain Responds to \"The Antics of Incomprehensible Orientals\" (U) The two countries tried to resolve the dispute, but differing negotiating styles and the personalities involved hindered these efforts. Many Britons found Mossadeq's seemingly impossible demands and unpredictably shifting arguments inexplicable. L.P. Elwell-Sutton captured the mood of British policymakers at the time when he wrote, \"Really, it seemed hardly fair that dignified and correct western statesmanship should be defeated by the antics of incomprehensible orientals.\"15 (U) Mossadeq found the British evil, not incomprehensible. He and millions of Iranians believed that for centuries Britain had manipulated their country for British ends. Many Iranians seemed convinced that British intrigue was at the root of every domestic misfortune. In 1951 Mossadeq told US Special Envoy W. Averell Harriman, \"You do not know how crafty they [the British] are. You do not know how evil they are. You do not know how they sully everything they touch.\" Harriman protested that surely the British 13(S) SE-6, Current Developments in Iran, 22 May 1951. 14(s) In March 1951 the CIA estimated that 6 to 8 percent of Iran's national income came from AIOC and that the AIOC contributed nearly one quarter of the Iranian Treasury's receipts.

Mossadeq was not persuaded. \"You do not know them,\" he insisted. \"You do not know them.\"16 ï¿½ (U) When it seemed clear that Tehran had no intention of compensating London for AIOC's assets, the British mounted a multi-pronged effort to reassert control over the company. They hoped legal and economic pressure would convince Mossadeq to settle on British terms. If not, they were prepared to force him from office and replace him with someone open to compromise on terms favorable to the AIOC. (U) London first asked the International Court of Justice to arbitrate the dispute. Mossadeq rejected two British proposals because neither of them addressed the issue of Iran's sovereignty over its own oil. The British thereafter refused to deal directly with Mossadeq. They used economic weapons and then tried ostentatious military maneuvers in the Persian Gulf to try to weaken Mossadeq's negotiating position. (U) In September 1951, Britain placed an embargo on shipments of steel, sugar, iron, and oilï¿½processing equipment shipments to Iranï¿½that is, on almost anything that the Iranians could exchange for dollars. The AIOC laid off 20,000 oil workers at the port at Abadan and Mossadeq had to put them on the government payroll. Gradually, the flow of Iranian oil to the rest of the world stopped. (U) A British airborne brigade arrived in Cyprus and a Royal Navy cruiser and four destroyers exercised near the oil facilities at Abadan. The display of British force did not intimidate Mossadeq; he announced that the first shot would start a world war. (U) Britain also considered covert action options while it maneuvered diplomatically and militarily. According to C.M. Woodhouse, MI6's Chief of Station in Tehran, the idea of overthrowing Mossadeq came from the Foreign Office, not British intelligence. Woodhouse himself thought that any move against Mossadeq had to have American support and participation. London had neither until the inauguration of President Dwight Eisenhower in January 1953.17 16(tj) Vernon A. Walters, Silent Missions (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1978), pp. 247-48. 17 (T C M Woodhouse Somethine Ventured (London: Granada, 1982), pp. 110-111. 5 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) Mossadeq Challenges the Shah (U) At the same time that he was quarreling with the British, Mossadeq also was struggling against the Shah. He insisted that the Shah should reign and not rule. To that end, he worked to enhance the power of the Majlis at the Shah's expense. The flash point came in July 1952, when Mossadeq resigned during a dispute over whether the Shah or the Prime Minister should appoint the war minister. (U) During the elections for the 17th Majlis earlier in the year, voteï¿½tampering by the Iranian Royal Court had convinced Mossadeq that the government's survival depended on control of the military. On 16 July he demanded the right to appoint himself minister of war. The Shah refused and Mossadeq resigned.19 Mossadeq appealed directly to the public and accused the Shah of violating the Constitution. (U) Mossadeq's resignation initially appeared to be a shrewd political move that underscored his mastery of Iranian politics and his ability to gauge and exploit public opinion. The Shah appointed Ahmad Qavam, Prime Minister during the Azeri crisis with the Soviet Union in 1947, to succeed Mossadeq. In response, the National Front, a broad coalition formed in 1949, organized mass demonstrations in Tehran demanding Mossadeq's return. The demonstrations turned violent-69 people died and more than 750 were injuredï¿½but the Shah refused to use the police or the military to restore order. Qavam lacked broad support and was unable to organize counterï¿½demonstrations. For five days the National Front controlled the streets of Tehran and other cities. On 21 July 1952 the Shah bowed to the pressure and replaced Qavam with Mossadeq.20 (U) Once back in power, Mossadeq struck back at the Shah and the military. He transferred Reza Shah's lands back to the State, appointed himself Minister of War, forced the Shah's twin sister Princess Ashraf to leave the country, and forbade Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from communicating directly with foreign diplomats.

Mossadeq wrote I cannot continue in office without having the responsibility for the Ministry of War, and since Your Majesty did not concede to this, I feel I do not enjoy the full confidence of the Sovereign and, therefore, offer my resignation to pave the way for another government which might be able to carry out Your Majesty's wishes.

The National Front was a loose coalition of political parties professing liberal democratic aims and opposing foreign intervention in Iranian affairs. The National Front included the leftist, anti-Soviet intellectuals of the Iran Party; the workers and leftist intellectuals of the Toilers' Party; and the workers, bazaar merchants, and Islamic clergy of the Mujahedeen-i- Islam (Warriors of Islam) Party. Ayatollah Abul Quassem Kashani, later instrumental in the coup against Mossadeq, was one of the leaders of the Warriors of Islam. The ultranationalist Pan-Iranist Party, affiliated with the National Front but not a member, included many lower class toughs. The Tudeh (Iranian Communist Party) was not a member of the National Front but included itself among the parties opposing the government. Mark J. Gasiorowski, \"The 1953 Coup d'etat in Iran,\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 19 (Aug. 1987): 262. 6 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET 1953, according to Iranian specialist Ervand Abrahamian, \"the shah had been stripped of all the powers he had fought for and recovered since August 1941.\"21 (U) The Prime Minister also seized the opportunity to purge the Iranian officer corps. He forcibly retired many Royalist officers, and cut the military budget 15%. To add to the insult, Mossadeq transferred 15,000 men from the military to the Gendarmerie, the military's bureaucratic rival. These acts fueled smoldering resentment among the dismissed officers and those few royalists escaping Mossadeq's purge.22 (U) Mossadeq used his popularity and ability to control the streets of Tehran to good advantage. When the British appeared intransigent during the oil negotiations, he simply severed diplomatic relations in October 1952. All British personnel left the country in an overland exodus at the beginning of November 1952.23 (U) Mossadeq's apparent political triumph rapidly turned sour. The National Front began to unravel in late 1952 and early 1953 as the Prime Minister grew increasingly dictatorial. By November 1952, Ayatollah Abul Quassem Kashani, a key Islamic cleric in the National Front, had turned against Mossadeq and quit the Front, as had Mozaffar Baqai's Toilers' Party. Kashani's defection was a particularly hard blow because his group, the Warriors of Islam, included the bazaar merchants of Tehran and many mullahs (Islamic clerics). Support from these two groups historically has been critical to Iranian governments.24 (U) The reasons for the defections were complex. Although 30 of the 79 deputies of the 17th Majlis, convened in February 1952, belonged to or identified with the National Front, they represented different constituencies and interests were united only in their opposition to the British. In addition, nationalization of the AIOC did not produce the bonanza for Iran that Mossadeq had hoped it would. He began to demand more and more power from the Majlis, and when the legislature granted the Prime Minister what amounted to dictatorial powers, Ayatollah Kashani resigned as Majlis speaker. Toilers' Party leader Mozaffar Baqai compared Mossadeq to Hitler and praised the army as a bulwark against Communism.25 (U) Some groups in the National Front continued to back Mossadeq.

As support for Mossadeq narrowed, the Tudeh would soon be the only group willing to take to the streets on his behalf (U) Ayatollah Kashani's defection and increased squabbling among the deputies effectively paralyzed the Majlis. Opposition politiciansï¿½including former Mossadeq allies like Kashaniï¿½blocked the Prime Minister's legislation. In early June 1953, fistfights broke out in the Majlis. The Prime Minister won a temporary victory when Abdullah Moazemi, a Mossadeq supporter, succeeded Kashani as speaker in a close Majlis vote (41 to 31) on 1 July 1953. Mossadeq recognized, however, that the Majlis was hopelessly deadlocked and that dissolution and new elections were necessary to break the stalemate.27 (U) Under the Iranian constitution only the Shah could dissolve the Majlis. The government could request him to do so. Mossadeq knew the Shah would not agree to such a proposal, so he devised a plan to achieve the same end. He asked all National Front members and supporters to resign, which they did, and simultaneously announced the dissolution of the Majlis. The Iranian people, he held, could ratify or reject his decision in a referendum on the theory that popular will superseded the constitution. Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian has noted the irony in Mossadeq's rationale. \"Mossadeq, the constitutional lawyer who had meticulously quoted the fundamental laws against the shah,\" Abrahamian wrote, \"was now bypassing the same laws and resorting to the theory of the general will.\"28 (U) From 3 to 10 August 1953, Iranians voted on Mossadeq's bold and unconstitutional act. The results of the rigged election were never in doubt. Mossadeq purposely excluded rural areas from the balloting, ostensibly because it would take too long to count the votes from remote areas. The ballot was not secret, and there were separate polling places for \"yes\" and \"no.\" In the end, Mossadeq claimed victory, gaining \"over 2,043,300 of the 2,044,600 ballots cast throughout the country and 101,396 of the 101,463 ballots cast in the capital.\"29 (U) The dissolution of the Majlis and the tainted referendum alienated Iranian liberals and conservatives alike. Jamal Imami, a pro-British member of the Majlis, warned that Mossadeq was leading the country toward anarchy. Ayatollah Kashani declared the referendum illegal under Islamic religious law. At his trial in late 1953, Mossadeq defended his actions on the grounds of popular sovereignty. \"In view of the Royal Court's flagrant interference in the electoral process, we had to suspend the 27(U) Mark J.

In an interview appearing in the 22 August 1962 issue of Deutsche Zeitung, Mossadeq admitted that he dissolved the 17th Majlis to avoid a confidence vote that would have caused his government to fall. 8 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET remainder of the Majlis elections,\" he told the court. \"What else was left to us but consulting the people in a most democratic method of direct plebiscite?\"30 (U) A US Embassy assessment cabled to Washington shortly after the referendum stated that the dissolution of the Majlis \"will graphically demonstrate truism of [Mossadeq's] regime that as opposition and discontent have mounted, Mossadeq has moved steadily in authoritarian direction using technique of mobocracy to maintain his hold on power and to eliminate influence Shah.\" Nonetheless, the Embassy thought Mossadeq's continued appeals to the street could boomerang because he lacked \"any real authoritarian organization aside from armed forces.\" To compensate, according to the Embassy, he would be forced to rely increasingly on the Tudeh, thereby alienating the non-Communist followers of his Government.31 (U) Mossadeq Looks for American Support (U) Mossadeq hoped for US support in his struggle against the British. Like many in the Third World immediately after World War II, he saw the United States as an anti- colonial power. His hopes were not entirely misplaced; the Truman administration saw some merit in his position. (U) Secretary of State Acheson thought that the British were overly preoccupied with their oil interests and that London did not fully understand the broader Communist threat. He saw Mossadeq as a potentially important part of the solution to the problem of Soviet influence in the Middle East. In Acheson's view, the Iranian Prime Minister would in time become an effective bulwark against Soviet penetration into Iran. To that end, Washington consistently urged London to reach an equitable settlement with Tehran. Acheson apparently was convinced that an agreement would strengthen the Iranian government and promote regional stability.32 (U) Other considerations, however, complicated the Truman administration's approach. The United States was loath to side publicly with Iran or put excessive pressure on London. Washington needed cooperation and support from Britainï¿½ America's closest allyï¿½elsewhere in the world. The war in Korea was not yet over, and the presence of British combat troops was an important symbol of Anglo-American solidarity. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), created in 1949, was still in its formative stages and depended upon British participation as evidence of Western unity 30(U) Ghods, p. 188; Zabih, pp. 112-13.

Vigorous American support for Mossadeq would have complicated American foreign policy in other parts of the world as well. (U) President Truman had no patience with those refusing to view the Anglo- Iranian problem in a global context. When the US Ambassador to Iran, Henry Grady, wrote to Truman complaining that the White House was not listening to his advice, the President let him know exactly where he stood. \"Let me tell you something about the Iranian Situation from this end,\" he wrote. (U) [we] held Cabinet meetings on itï¿½we held Security Council meetings on it, and Dean, Bob Lovett, Charlie Sawyer, Harriman and all the senior staff of the Central Intelligence discussed that awful situation with me time and again. . . We tried. . . to get the block headed British to have their oil company make a fair deal with Iran. No, they could not do that. They know all about how to handle itï¿½we didn't according to them. (U) We had Israel, Egypt, Near East defense, Sudan, South Africa, Tunisia, the NATO treaties all on the fire. Britain and the Commonwealth Nations were and are absolutely essential if these things are successful. Then, on top of it all we have Korea and Indo-China. Iran was only one incident. Of course the man on the ground in each one of these places can only see his own problem.33 (C) The suggestion that British forces might occupy the port city of Abadan or launch some other military action against Iran set off alarms in ONE. In an April 1951 memorandum to DCI Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, ONE chief Dr. William Langer warned that the appearance of British troops in Iran might result in Soviet occupation of the northern part of the country under the terms of the 1921 treaty of friendship between Persia and Soviet Russia.34 33(U) Farhad Diba, Mohammad Mossadegh: A Political Biography (London: Croom Helm, 1986), pp. 131-32, citing papers of Henry Grady.

Langer, Assistant Director National Estimates, Memorandum for Director of Central Intelliaence Walter Bedell Smith, \"Situation in Iran,\" 20 April 1951 (emphasis added). (U) In February 1921, Persia, as Iran was then known, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RFSFR) [the USSR did not exist until December 1922] signed a treaty of friendship. Article VI gave the RSFSR the right to send troops into Persia if a third party tried to use that country as a base from which to attack Soviet Russia. Russian troops would cross the border only if Persia proved incapable of removing the threat itself. In an exchange of explanatory notes in December 1921, the Russians made clear that the treaty applied \"only to cases in which preparations have been made for a considerable armed attack upon Russia. . .by the partisans of the regime which has been overthrown [the Tsarist Government] or by its supporters. . . .\" Leonard Shapiro, ed., Soviet Treaty Series: A Collection of Bilateral Treaties, Agreements and Convenstions, Etc., Concluded Between The Soviet Union and Foreign Powers, vol. 1, 1917-1928 (Washington, DC: The Georgetown University Press, 1950), pp. 92-94, 150- 51. 10 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (S) Neither Langer nor any of the Iran specialists in CIA's clandestine serviceï¿½ the Office of Special Operations (0S0), and the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC)ï¿½ thought the Tudeh was strong enough by itself to topple Mossadeq. As long as the central government remained able to deal with events, Langer and others saw the danger of a Tudeh coup as negligible. \"Tudeh represents a serious threat in view of the opportunities awaiting it,\" OSO and OPC specialists agreed in January 1952, \"but does not yet have the intention or the ability to gain actual control of the government at this time either by force or political means.\"38 CIA's operators thought that the Tudeh would come to power only through chaos and impotent central authority. (U) Although the documents in CIA's files do not indicate that Smith relayed Langer's concerns to President Truman, he evidently did so because the administration subsequently let London know that the US Government disapproved of any military action against Iran. At a British cabinet meeting in September 1951, the government of (U) Strictly speaking, the USSR could not have invoked Article VI if a small British force occupied Abadan in 1951. Abadan is far from the Soviet-Iranian border and the few troops the British contemplated sending could not have made a \"considerable armed attack\" upon Soviet forces. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the USSR would have found some pretext to occupy northern Iran had Stalin desired. 38(5) R.L.

According to an ONE estimate, if the unrest plaguing Iran in 1952 continued through 1953, \"rising internal tensions and continued deterioration of the economy and of the budgetary position of the government might lead to a breakdown of government authority and open the way for at least a gradual assumption of control by Tudeh.\" ONE thought Soviet intervention into Iran was unlikely \"unless there is a far more serious deterioration of Iranian internal stability than is foreseen in this estimate. However, the USSR has the capability for greatly increasing its overt and covert interference in Iran at any time, to the detriment of US security interests.\"46 (U) During the last two months of 1952, both ONE and the Iran Branch of the DDP watched events in Iran and hoped things would not change radically. Their hopes were soon dashed. (U) Foggy Bottom's Differences with Whitehall (U) As the foregoing indicates, Washington and London had fundamentally different perspectives on the events in Iran and on their consequences worldwide. These differences complicated the State Department's and Foreign Office's search for a common policy. At times the problems must have appeared insolvable. (U) In January 1952 an internal memorandum in the State Department's Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs identified two areas of disagreement. The United States and the United Kingdom had differing views on the strength of nationalism in Iran (and therefore on Mossadeq's political strength), and on the global consequences of Tehran's failure to reach an oil settlement with London.47 (U) The State Department recognized that Iranian nationalism was a potent and growing force, making an oil settlement on British terms unattainable even if Mossadeq fell. In contrast, the British disparaged Iranian nationalism as merely a \"passing storm.\" 46(U) Office of National Estimates, \"Probable Developments in Iran Through 1953,\" NIE-75, 13 November 1952. 47(U) Memorandum, \"Varying British and American Appraisals of the Iranian Situation,\" 14 January 1952, Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs, Department of State, RG 59, Records of the Department of State, Records of the Office in Charge of Iranian Affairs, 1946-54, Lot 57, D 529, Box 40, National Archives and Records Administration. 13 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET It had no roots and would \"pass and its leaders fall as soon as it is demonstrated that their policies have brought Iran to the brink of ruin.\"48 (U) More specifically, American officials feared that a British failure to compromise with Mossadeq would enable him to whip up Iran's virulent nationalism further, with potentially disastrous results. The West might well lose so much of its influence that it could not stop Tehran from moving the Soviet orbit. Or the Iranian political situation could simply descend into chaos, in which case the Sovietï¿½backed Tudehï¿½Iran's best organized, best financed, and most effective political organizationï¿½ would be ready to fill the vacuum. In the State Department's view, such developments would jeopardize the security and stability of the entire Middle East, would serve notice that the West could not preserve the independence of important Third World states, and could deprive the West not only of Iran's oil but ultimately that of its Arab neighbors as wel1.49 (U) In contrast, the British regarded Iran as basically a conservative country that would not seek Soviet help nor collapse internally if London held out for the kind of oil settlement it wanted. The British also feared that a \"bad\" settlement (one not on their terms) would severely diminish their global political and economic power, already starting to decline with the postï¿½World War II emergence of independence movements in much of the British empire.50 (U) The only suggestion for resolving these differences offered in the State Department's internal memorandum further consultation to determine the \"political, military, economic, and psychological effects of the loss of Iran to the west as balanced against the political and economic effects of an agreement with the Iranians on the oil situation which might prejudice other concessions elsewhere and diminish British prestige throughout the world.\" The memorandum concluded that unless the US and United Kingdom agreed on the importance to the West of an independent Iran, there was little chance the two would be able to forge a common policy.51 (U) Eleven months later the National Security Council set forth basic US policy toward Iran. NSC 136/1 emphasized that the United States was committed to preventing Iran from falling under communist control and that Iran's strategic position, its oil, and its vulnerability to Soviet political subversion or military attack made it a tempting target for Soviet expansion. If the Tudeh Party seized or attempted to seize control of the Iranian government, the document argued, the United States should, in conjunction with the British, be ready to support a non-communist Iranian government militarily, economically, diplomatically, and psychologically.52 48(U) Ibid. 49(U) Ibid.

His campaign pledge to end the Korean war had priority, and only weeks after the inaugural festivities Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died. The new administration was faced with reevaluating Soviet-American relations. Under these circumstances, events in Iran receded into the foreign policy backgroundï¿½ temporarily.53 (U) The British had never given up hope of executing a covert action to remove Mossadeq, and continued to test the American response. After Mossadeq severed diplomatic relations with Britain in October 1952, the indefatigable Woodhouse met in London with Foreign Office officials, including Anthony Eden, to consider options available to Britain. According to Woodhouse, Eden said that no covert operation would succeed unless it had American support. Woodhouse \"took his words as tantamount to permission to pursue the idea further with the Americans, particularly with the CIA.\" This he did, arriving in Washington in mid-November 1952 after Dwight Eisenhower's victory.54 (S) Woodhouse met with State and CIA officials and argued that political conditions in Iran made that country subject to a serious Communist threat. He did not stress the oil issue. His reception at Truman's State Department was \"chilly\"; at CIA, he met with initial skepticism. Walter Bedell Smith told him 'You may be able to throw out Musaddiq, but you will never get your own man to stick in his place.\" Frank Wisner and future DCI Allen Dulles showed increasing interest and eventually warmed to the idea of planning a covert operation to remove the Iranian Prime Minister. Woodhouse writes that Dulles enlisted \"a young academic expert on Iran to examine the situation with us.\" (S) Allen Dulles became DCI in late February 1953 and promptly apprised the President of the situation in Iran. Mossadeq, Dulles told the President, remained the single strongest Iranian political leader. With the Shah showing no inclination to marshal the armed forces for a move against Mossadeq, the situation, in Dulles's words, was \"slowly disintegrating.\" If a showdown developed between the Shah and Mossadeq, \"and a real armed conflict ensued between the two opposing elements, the communist Tudeh elements might come up as the victors with their relatively small but well organized group of supporters and with the assistance of the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, disposing nlentv nf funds\" 53(U) Brands, p. 272. 54 (U) Woodhouse, pp. 116-17. 55 1.1 Thirl n 119 15 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) President Truman's and Secretary Acheson's policy of encouraging the parties to reach an equitable oil settlement had reached a dead end. Neither the British nor Mossadeq appeared willing to back off from their publicly stated positions, which each by this time held with something approaching religious fervor. To London's relief, the new US administration abandoned the search for a negotiated end to the crisis. Perhaps now, the British hoped, Washington would finally begin to see Mossadeq as the demagogue Londr thought he was and take appropriate action. (U) Also in March 1953, State Department officials and British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden met to discuss the Iranian situation. Eden found the Americans much more receptive to the British viewpoint than they had been under Truman and Acheson. The collapse of the Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations had changed the Americans' attitude; Washington now considered Mossadeq a source of instability and feared that his continued tenure invited a Tudeh coup. (C) The State Department agreed with Eden that Mossadeq had to go, but its reasons differed from his. For Eden and his government, Mossadeq's policies damaged \"British prestige, influence, and vital commercial interest.\" For the Americans, Mossadeq represented a weakened Iran and its increasing vulnerability to Soviet domination.58 (U) The United States suspected the Soviets of trying to take advantage of the deteriorating situation in Iran. In the US view, Soviet leaders undoubtedly saw Mossadeq's troubles as a diplomatic opening, and if he wanted to try to play Moscow against Washington, the Soviets would let him. The Kremlin would help him.

(S) The Soviet-Iranian negotiations were front page news in The New York Times on 11 August 1953. Iranian Ambassador to the United States Allahyar Saleh met for 90 minutes on the 11th with John Jernegan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs. Jernegan learned that Iran was interested in maintaining good relations with the United States as well as the Soviet Union. (S) Upon leaving the State Department, Saleh met a group of waiting reporters wanting to know whether the meeting had anything to do with Iranian-Soviet negotiations and whether the US had reason to be concerned about such talks. Saleh replied that the American Government should be pleased about the negotiations because they might resolve claims arising from Iranian expenses incurred in furthering American policy aims in World War II. (U) The Iranian-Soviet negotiations were never held. On the day he met with Jernegan, Saleh could not know that the Mossadeq government would remain in power 17 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET only eight more days. President Eisenhower apparently had already made the decision to oust the Iranian Prime Minister. (U) Mossadeq's Successor: Ayatollah Kashani or Fazlollah Zahedi? (U) At this point, there was no consensus on who should replace Mossadeq. US officials briefly considered backing Ayatollah Kashani, the former Mossadeq ally, who had a large following and had become a strident opponent of the Prime Minister.60 (S) CIA Headquarters viewed the prospect of a Kashani government with alarm. According to a Special Estimate published on 14 October 1952, a Kashani-led Iran would be worse for Western interests than if Mossadeq stayed in power. Such a regime would be even more difficult on the oil issue and would be more resistant to Western influence. The military, or even Mossadeq's followers, might well overthrow Kashani. The worst consequence of a Kashani government would be the \"progressive general deterioration of Iran possibly leading to the eventual assumption of power by the Tudeh.\"61 (U) Opinion gradually settled on General Fazlollah Zahedi as Mossadeq's successor. Zahedi had served as an irregular soldier under the Shah's father, Reza Shah, in 1915 and subsequently rose through the ranks of the Iranian Army. In 1942 the British arrested him for his activities under Nazi agent Franz Mayer and deported him to Palestine. Zahedi worked for the Germans because of his anti-British views; he was not generally thought to be pro-Nazi. The British released him on VE Day in 1945. Zahedi retired from the army in 1949 and subsequently served in a series of mostly honorary posts. He was Minister of the Interior in the early 1950s.62 (S) Zahedi's association with the Germans during the war was not the only blot on his record. Although he was a staunch anti-Communist, the CIA thought him \"like all 61(s) Office of National Estimates, \"Prospects for Survival of Mossadeq Regime in Iran,\" SE-33, 14 October 1952, p. 3, Records of the Office of National Estimates, Directorate of Intelligence, ARC. 18 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET Iranians on the public scene [not] noted for honesty, consistency, reliability and strength of convictions.\"63 (U) The State Department recognized that he was not the ideal candidate, but was qualified because he seemed \"friendly to the United States and Britain and would be acceptable to both Governments.\"64 Even more importantly, he was willing to take the job. (S) Zahedi was the only opposition figure meeting two other important criteria: he had consistently opposed Mossadeq, and he had a significant following. Other potential candidates either had a longer record of opposition or more followers, but none had both. Zahedi claimed to have the support of Ayatollah Kashani, court officials, elements of the armed forces, influential merchants in thc hazaar and most of the Iranian people. This last assertion, at least, was dubious, for a an Iranian specialist working as a consultant for DDP's Near East and Africa Division, observed: \"It is far more likely that the man in the street continues to admire Mossadeq for his strong stand against the British and as a symbol of resurgent nationalism. However, this element is of no practical value to either side unless effectively organized and led.\"65 (U) Whoever succeeded Mossadeq would be able to count on US support. In March 1953, an internal memorandum by the State Department's Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs outlined the steps the United States was likely to take if Mossadeq fell. Although American officials would limit their public pronouncements to expressions of unwillingness to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, privately they would use non-US channels to assure the Shah and new prime minister that Washington was eager to help. Sensitivity to Iranian concerns that the country was being turned into a foreign base would preclude ostentatious and immediate American military assistance, but privately the Americans could assure Tehran that meaningful military aid (trucks, communication equipment, and other items that also had civilian uses) would be forthcoming.66 (U) Eisenhower Turns to CIA (U) President Eisenhower had several options for implementing Mossadeq's removal. He could use military force to invade Iran, but that was impractical for obvious reasons. He could keep hoping that a diplomatic solution would appear. That option too was not viable; diplomacy had already failed and the political situation in Iran was worsening daily. Finally, he could turn to CIA for a covert political operation; the National Security Council had decided that covert action was a legitimate instrument of US policy.67 This alternative held the promise of attaining the result the administration 63(TS) Ibid. 64(TS1 State Department \"Proposal to Bring About Change of Government in Iran,\" 25 June 1953 65(TS) Ibid. 66(u) \"Measures Which the United States Government Might Take in Support of a Successor Government to Mosadeq,\" March 1953, Department of State, Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Issues, RG 59, Lot 57, D 529, Box 40, National Archives and Records Administration. 67(U) In NSC 10/2. 19 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET wanted with a minimum of cost and attention.

Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose has written that the absence of documentation reflected the President's style: (U) Before going into the operation, Ajax had to have the approval of the President. Eisenhower participated in none of the meetings that set up Ajax; he received only oral reports on the plan; and he did not discuss it with his Cabinet or the NSC. Establishing a pattern he would hold to throughout his Presidency, he kept his distance and left no documents behind that could implicate the President in any projected coup.

The DDP, CIA's clandestine service, was less than a year old when it received the TPAJAX assignment. Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith had created the directorate in August 1952 by combining the Office of Special Operations and the Office of Policy Coordination. The two had been rivals, and Smith hoped their merger would prevent continued friction and duplication of effort. (U) Kermit \"Kim\" Roosevelt, grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, was the chief of NEA Division. A 1938 Harvard graduate, Roosevelt had embarked on a scholarly career teaching government to undergraduatesï¿½first at Harvard and then at the California Institute of Technology. He joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War H and worked for the chief of the organization's Secret Intelligence Branch in the Near East. After the war he compiled the official OSS war report and then returned to the Middle East as a writer for the Saturday Evening Post.2 In 1947 he published Arabs, Oil, and History: The Story of the Middle East.3 C.M. Woodhouse of MIS wrote in his memoirs that Roosevelt \"had a natural inclination for bold and imaginative action, and also a friendly sympathy with the British.\"4 (S) Roosevelt did not \"look\" like an operative (Kim Philby called him \"the last person you'd expect to be up to his neck in dirty tricks\"), but was an intellectual with 1 (U) The name went through several permutations before settling on Near East and Africa Division. 2(U) Burton Hersh, The Old Boys: The American Elite and the Origins of the CIA (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1992), p. 331; G.J.A.

The Shah enjoyed the allegiance of almost all Iranian Army officers; they had been raised to regard their monarch as a symbol of loyalty and patriotism. Whether he wielded any \"control\" was more problematic.

President Eisenhower did not attend, but other top officials did: Secretary of State John Foster Dulles; Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson; DCI Allen Dulles; Undersecretary of State and former DCI Walter Bedell Smith; Deputy Undersecretary of State Robert Murphy; Robert Bowie, head of the State Department's policy planning staff (and subsequent CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence in the late 1970s); Henry Byroade, Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East; and US Ambassador to Iran Loy Henderson.61 (U) After Roosevelt's briefing, Secretary of State Dulles polled the meeting. Allen Dulles and Walter Bedell Smith were strongly in favor of proceeding; the others agreed but were less enthusiastic. Henderson did not like covert operations but thought the United States had no choice in this case.62 (U) Nor did CIA have to notify Congress of its impending operation. Allen Dulles may have informally told key Senators like Richard Russell, as well as key members of the House of Representatives, what the Agency was doing, but CIA's files contain no record of these conversations. 61(u) Brands, p. 281.

Foreign intelligence assets, not covert action assets, collect the sorts of information Carroll needed. Two possible reasons explain the paucity of information. Either the foreign intelligence assets had not been tasked properly, or, as is more likely, their focus up to this time had been on the Soviet Union and its activities rather than on Iranian activities. The USSR invariably was the main target of the American intelligence effort, and most if not all of CIA's foreign intelligence assets in Tehran were almost certainly trvin2 to collect information on the Soviets. 42 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET 43 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) TEXT BOX: The Corrupt and Impotent Iranian Army (S) The Iranian Army in 1953 was understrength, undere quipped, and ill prepared to repel invasion, suppress a country-wide insurrection, or defeat Tudeh subversion. Its 125,000 men comprised eight divisions, nine independent brigades, and one military police brigade. According to a US Army Intelligence Staff Study in December 1952, the Iranian officer corps was corrupt and lacked leadership ability. Promotions were based on politics rather than merit. The enlisted men were mostly tough peasants who uncomplainingly endured hardships and privations unthinkable to Western soldiers. These traits made the enlisted ranks amenable to discipline but made instilling initiative almost impossible. The absence of modern weapons and shortage of ammunition made training almost nonexistent. The US Army report concluded that Iranian Army units had no offensive capability and negligible defensive capability.13 (S) The General Staff positioned the divisions and brigades with an eye toward suppressing Iran's sometimes unruly tribes, rather than where they would be best able to defend the country against a Soviet invasion. Accordingly, most of the divisions were in the south and east, rather than along the northern border with the USSR.

He explained to her that Mossadeq posed a continuing danger for Iran and that she should convince her brother to 1 dism ss him She was unenthusiastic. (U) The Princess also was convinced that Mossadeq would do whatever he could to prevent her return. She had already written to the Prime Minister three times, saying that she wanted to come back to Iran because she could no longer afford to live in Europe. When she saw, with some prompting, that a surreptitious visit to the Shah might improve her chances of returning home permanently, she began to warm to the idea. (U) Princess Ashraf arrived in Tehran on 25 July 1953 and met with her brother four days later. She was unable to convince him to sign the firmans and left Tehran the following day. 45 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET 23(U) The arrival of Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Lavrentiev in Tehran on 1 August 1953 probably heightened Washington's and Roosevelt's sense of urgency.

One afternoon the Shah was relaxing outside with a circle of friends. A butler approached and whispered into the Shah's ear, and the Shah replied loudly, \"Tell him to come in.\" A man in a dark suit whom Farmanfarmaian did not recognize appeared from behind some trees and, after a few words with the Shah, presented him with a document. The Shah asked if anyone had a pen; Farmanfarmaian offered his. After signing the document, the Shah noted that the pen would be worth much more now that he'd used it to sign the paper. \"A fortune?\" Farmanfarmaian joked. \"Perhaps,\" the monarch replied. \"Perhaps it will bring us all luck as well.\" Farmanfarmaian writes that he \"found out later that the messenger had been sent by Kermit Roosevelt and the document the Shah had signed appointed General Zahedi prime minister.\"28 (S) Nassiri returned to Tehran with the signed documents late on the evening of 13 August.29 In his book Countercoup, Roosevelt notes that nothing could be done on the 25(S) Donald Wilber, Operation TPAJAX (draft), March 1954, Directorate of Operations Records, Job 80-1701, Box 3, Folder 11, p.26, ARC. 26(u) Nassiri later became the head of SAVAK. In 1978, former Agency officer Miles Copeland met General Nassiri to discuss Ayatollah Khomeini and the deteriorating situation in Iran.

Farmanfarmaian says that the Shah signed the firman on a Sunday in the second week of August. This cannot be correct, for the firman was not signed until 13 August. The second Sunday in August was the ninth, and the third Sunday was the sixteenth. 29 A State Department cable reported that the firman appointing Zahedi read: View of fact situation of nation necessitates appointment of an informed and experienced man who can grasp affairs of country readily, I therefore, with knowledge I have of your ability and merit, appoint you with this letter Prime Minister.

No longer was the operation essentially a military coup with the aim of installing Zahedi as Chief of the General Staff and then Prime Minister. Now it was an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the finnans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal. 30(U) Kermit Roosevelt, Countercoup: The Struggle for the Control of Iran, (New York: McGraw-Hill. 1979.)

On 29 June 1953, President Eisenhower sent a letter to Prime Minister Mossadeq making it clear that further American foreign aid would not be available. The letter appeared in the press 10 days later. On 28 July Secretary of State Dulles held a press conference in which he answered a planted question about the American view of Communist activity in Iran. \"The growing activities of the illegal Communist Party in Iran and the toleration of them by the Iranian Government,\" Dulles said, \"has caused our Government concern. These developments make it more difficult to grant aid to Iran.\" President Eisenhower asserted at the Governors' Conference in Seattle on 4 August that the United States would not sit by and watch Asian countries fall behind the Iron Curtain.34 33(U) Ibid.

Nassiri set out with two trucks of soldiers to arrest Mossadeq. When Nassiri arrived at Mossadeq's home to deliver the finnans and arrest the Prime Minister, he found himself surrounded and arrested instead.37 (S) Troops loyal to Mossadeq took the other participants into custody by early morning Sunday 16 August. By 0500 pro-Mossadeq troops and tanks ringed the Prime Minister's house. At 0545 Radio Tehran announced that the government had foiled a coup.38 Riahi informed the commanders of all military formations of the attempted coup and ordered them to monitor morale in their units and to prevent disorder and disturbance in their areas. Riahi's and Mossadeq's quick reactions effectively emasculated the military's participation in TPAJAX. (U) The original plan for a military operation had failed abysmally. Upon hearing of Nassiri's arrest, the principal anti-Mossadeq figures lost their courage. For example, General Batmangelich, who was to have captured Riahi's headquarters, turned back when he saw the troops surrounding the building. Batmangelich and Col. Akhavi soon found themselves under arrest. The Shah, for his part, left the summer palace in the suburbs of Tehran and flew to Baghdad via Ramsar. 50 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (S) The Shah's flight to Baghdad was no surprise, given his temperament and his inability to withstand any kind of psycholo4ical nressure The Shah later portrayed his flight to Baghdad as nart of the oneration 3C1 39In his memoirs, the Shah said: However, following a pre-arranged plan, the Queen and I had left Tehran before learning of the revolution's success. It had been decided weeks before that if Mossadegh should use force to resist his deposition, we would temporarily leave the country. I had decided upon this move because I believed that it would force Mossadegh and his henchmen to show their real allegiances, and that thereby it would help crystallize Persian public opinion.

He immediately sought and received an audience with Mossadeq. The ambassador asked the Prime Minister if he believed the Shah had issued orders dismissing him and appointing Zahedi. Mossadeq replied that he had never seen such documents, that he would not believe them if he saw them, and that in any event the Shah was powerless to dismiss him. According to Mossadeq, the Shah could not, on his own authority, demand a change in the government. Notwithstanding the Iranian constitution's provision that the prime minister serves at the pleasure of the monarch, Mossadeq contended that his power came from the people rather than the Shah.42 (U) At noon on Sunday 16 August, Mossadeq issued a brief statement over Radio Tehran: \"According to the will of the people, expressed by referendum, the 17th Majlis is dissolved. Elections for the 18th session will be held soon.\" Minister of Foreign Affairs Hoseyn Fatemi held a press conference that afternoon in which he reviewed the events of the coup and announced that the Acting Minister of Court Abul Ghassem Amini had been 42(u) H.W.

A US Embassy cable to Washington on 16 August blamed the coup attempt's failure squarely on \"the commonly appreciated difficulty in operating when confronted by current Iranian incapacity for large scale organized effort under clandestine conditions, and when confronted by unforeseen difficulties.\"46 (S) Without knowing the extent of American involvement in the move against Mossadeq, CIA's Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) analyzed the consequences of the failed military coup.47 An OCT assessment in the Current Intelligence Bulletin on 16 August stressed Mossadeq's continued mastery of the situation. According to OCT, the Prime Minister could be expected to move against his enemies and proceed arbitrarily. \"The shah's flight, the involvement of the commander of the imperial guards as leader of the coup, and the imperial decrees to remove Mossadeq and appoint General Zahedi prime minister,\" OCI asserted, \"present Mossadeq with the opportunity of reducing the Shah's position still further or attempting to eliminate the monarchy altogether.\"48 (C) On 17 August, OCT published a more in-depth analysis, opining that the coup's failure had broken the will of Mossadeq's opposition. In the analysts' view, no group appeared willing to act after Mossadeq apparently had some ringleaders under 45(S) TEHE 724, 18 August 1953. 46(5) TEHE 704, 16 August 1953. 47(U) See Appendix E for a discussion of the limited role that CIA's analytical components played before and during the operation. 48 (TS) Office of Current Intelligence, Current Intelligence Bulletin, 16 August 1953, p. 3. 53 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET arrest and forced others into hiding.

If the Prime Minister did not succeed in forcing the Shah to abdicate, \"he will manage to strip from [the monarch] the remaining vestiges of power.\" \"Mossadeq,\" OCI concluded, \"[may] be expected to retain political control but will probably assume a more dictatorial position and indulge in more chicanery to maintain himself.\"50 The situation seemed irretrievable to US analysts unwitting of NEA's plans to try again. 49(C) \"Assessment of the Iranian Situation,\" 17 August 1953, Office of Current Intelligence, 513(C) Ibid. 54 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET Chapter 4 (U) Victory (S) The US Embassy in Tehran may have been ready to write off TPAJAX, but Kermit Roosevelt was not. He knew that the elements for success were still present even though the anti-Mossadeq Iranian military leadership had collapsed ignominiously at the first hint of resistance. Mossadeq remained politically isolated and the military, for all its inactivity, was basically pro-Shah. (S) CIA no longer viewed TPAJAX as a military coup; it was now a political action designed to swing the Iranian military away from the illegal Mossadeq government and place the armed forces squarely and actively behind the Shah and the legal Zahedi government. Inducing the military to move in this direction would require a rapid, concentrated, and effectively improvised psychological warfare campaign to publicize the notion that Mossadeq had launched a coup against the legitimate government. Roosevelt wanted to control events to the extent possible, but he was also prepared to react to them and take advantage of fluid situations. (U) Sunday 16 August: Roosevelt and the Station Regroup (U) Roosevelt knew he held at least two powerful cards in the Shah's firmans. Although Zahedi was hiding from Mossadeq, under the Iranian Constitution he was the legal Prime Minister of Iran and Mossadeq was not. Roosevelt was convinced that if he could publicize and emphasize that theme, Mossadeq could not retain his illegal grip on power for long. 1(U) Love covered the entire crisis for The New York Times.

(U) \"Well,\" Wisner continued, \"he went to the Excelsior Hotel to book a room with his bride, and the pilot, there were only three of them, and he was crossing the street on his way into the hotel. Guess,. . . can you tell me, I don't want to say it over the phone, can you imagine what may have happened? Think of the worst thing you can think of that happened.\" (U) Waller said, \"He was hit by a cab and killed.\" (U) \"No, no, no, no,\" Wisner responded impatiently, by this time almost wild with excitement. \"Well, John, maybe you don't know, that Dulles had decided to extend his vacation by going to Rome. Now can you imagine what happened?\" (U) Waller answered, \"Dulles hit him with his car and killed him.\" (U) Wisner did not think it was funny. \"They both showed up at the reception desk at the Excelsior at the very same moment. And Dulles had to say, 'After you, your Majesty. \"25 (U) The meeting between Dulles and the Shah was completely fortuitous but fraught with embarrassment for the US Government and CIA had the news media learned of it. They did not, so the incident passed unnoticed. Wisner 's reaction strongly suggests that the meeting was coincidental. It was unlikely that he would have called Waller at 0200 in a panic and revealed sensitive information over an open telephone line if there had been a plan for the DCI to meet the Shah in Rome.26 26(U) In writing of this incident in Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles, Peter Grose says that \"Of all the conspiracy theories that later swirled around the personage of Allen Dulles, none has made a convincing case to accommodate this unfortunate proximity.\" Peter Grose, Gentleman Spy: the Life of Allen Dulles (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1994), p. 367. 60 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET 61 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET 62 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) At this point, members of Iranian Zuhrkhaneh (exercise clubs)ï¿½weightlifters, wrestlers, and acrobatsï¿½appeared at the head of the crowd. Their involvement was almost certainly the work of the Rashidian brothers and was a brilliant stroke that showed a profound understanding of Iranian psychology. (U) Iranians idolize acrobats and weightlifters in the same way that many Americans idolize baseball, basketball, or football players. The sight of these men tumbling or exercising in unison with dumbbells drew a crowd in an astonishingly short time. Moreover, the country's most famous athlete, Shaban \"Bi Mohk\" (Shaban \"the Brainless\") Jaffari, was in the lead and began chanting pro-Shah slogans. The effect was electrifying 36 (S he influence of the mullahs on the demonstration was clear. Holy men had galvanized many of the poor of South Tehran by hammering on the themes that the Soviet-backed Communists were taking over, the Shah was gone, and Mossadeq was to blame. The streets of Tehran, which had belonged to the Tudeh 24 hours earlier, now belonged to a different crowd. The few Tudeh members appearing on the streets around midï¿½morning 19 August saw that they were hopelessly outnumbered and lost their enthusiasm for a confrontation.37 They were swept away like so much chaff. (U) The swelling crowd headed for the offices of the pro-Mossadeq and anti- American newspaper, Bakhtar Emruz. Security forces watched passively as the crowd demolished the newspaper's office. By 1000 the crowd was headed for Mossadeq's residence at 109 Kakh (Palace) Street, which was ringed with tanks and troops loyal to the Prime Minister. (U) The troops guarding the residence were unsure of what was happening. When confronted with the large, angry crowd, some of the soldiers opened fire. The fighting escalated as pro-Shah troops returned fire. Mossadeq climbed over the wall surrounding his house and escaped. 63 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) The size and fervor of the demonstrations were critical in encouraging the military to come down on the side of the Shah and Prime Minister Zahedi. Although some members of the officer corps opposed Mossadeq, Roosevelt could not be certain that their units would follow their orders in the absence of evidence that the general population would back them up. The Iranian army has a long tradition of waiting to see who controls the streets before it acts. (S) By 1130 the military evidently had concluded that Mossadeq was through. Truckloads of pro-Shah soldiers sped through the streets of Tehran, and many troops joined th mobs that were shoutina \"Zendebad Shah!\" while waving pictures of the monarch 38(S) Ibid., pp. 10-11. 39(S) Ibid., p. 11. 40(s) Ibid., p. 12. 64 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (U) The broadcast in the afternoon of 19 August was confused and chaotic, but there was no doubt that pro-Shah forces had captured and were controlling Radio Tehran. The first indication came when the announcer said, \"The people of Tehran have risen today and occupied all the government offices, and I am able to talk to you all through the help of the armed forces. The government of Mossadeq is a government of rebellion and has fallen.\"41 Seven minutes later, amid much confusion and shouting on the air, a Col. Ali Pahlavon said, (U) Oh people of the cities, be wide awake. The government of Mossadeq has been defeated. My dear compatriots, listen! I am one of the soldiers and one of the devotees of this country. Oh officers, a number of traitors, like Hoseyn Fatemi, wants to sell out the country to the foreigners. (U) My dear compatriots, today the Iranian royalists have defeated the demagogue government by which Fatemi was ruling. The Iranian nation, officers, army, and the police have taken the situation in their hands. (U) Premier Zahedi will assume his post. There is no place for anxiety. Keep tranqui1.42 (U) The broadcast stopped. After seven minutes it continued with a woman shouting, (U) Oh people of Iran, let the Iranian nation prove that the foreigners cannot capture this country! Iranians love the King. Oh tribes of Iran, Mossadeq is ruling over your country without your knowledge, sending your country to the government of the hammer and sickle.43 (U) A major from the Iranian army said that he was an infantry officer \"retired by Mossadeq, the traitor. We proved to the world that the Iranian army is the protector of this country and is under the command of the Shah.\" Much confusion followed, after which Radio Tehran played the national anthem and then went off the air.44 (U) Wednesday Afternoon 19 August: \"Zendebad, Shah!\" 41(U) Intercept from Tehran Iranian Home Service, 19 August 1953, Directorate of Operations, Job 79-01228A, Box 11, Folder 14, ARC 42(U) Intercept from Tehran Iranian Home Service, 19 August 1953, Directorate of Operations, Job 79-01228A, Box 11, Folder 14, ARC. 43(U) Intercept from Tehran Iranian Home Service, 19 August 1953, Directorate of Operations, Job 79-01228A, Box 11, Folder 14, ARC. 44(u) Ibid.

I have been appointed your Prime Minister by order of His Majesty. Past governments have made many promises but have achieved very little. Nation must know I am lawful Prime Minister on Shah's orders.

At first, Ambassador Henderson did not want the monarch back in Tehran until popular pressure for his return became overwhelming.54 Washington, however, thought it was a good idea for the Shah to return as soon as possible. The State Department had reversed itself and now was strongly urging the Iranian ruler to make a statement thanking his people for their support and promising to return. CIA Headquarters added that \"We feel it extremely important for Shah to return immediately since issue is still in doubt and his presence just might make all the difference.\"55 (S) State favored pressuring the Shah if he hesitated. Under Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith wanted to remind Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of two points: (1) his actions were constitutional, legal, and in keeping with Iranian practice and tradition, and (2) had he stayed in Tehran, perhaps the earlier military coup attempt would have 54(S) TEHE 745, 19 August 1953. 55(S) Dir 16330, 19 August 1953. 68 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET succeeded. The initial failure, Smith thought, was in part a result of the Shah's sudden departure, \"leaving behind only pieces of paper which are not too meaningful or forceful in Ira r at best let alone when they are the subject of controversy as to their validity.\"56 he arrived in the Iranian capital on Saturday 22 August to a tumultuous and emotional welcome.57 His plane stopped in front of the ranks of the Imperial Guard, drawn up to greet their sovereign and commander. Kennett Love described the scene for The New York Times as the new Prime Minister met the Shah's airplane: (U) General Zahedi half-entered the plane and kissed the Shah's knee, then backed from the door to allow the 34-year-old Emperor to descend. The Shah wore the gold-braided blue gray uniform of the Air Force Commander in Chief that had been specially flown to Baghdad for his return. His eyes were moist and his mouth was set in an effort to control his emotions.58 The Mossadeq era was over.59 56(c) \"Ttemc for inclusion in messages to nossiblv Rome Baghdad and Telran,\" 19 August 1953, The points that Smith wanted to impress upon the Shah came from the Iranian ambassador in Washington. 57(S) TERE 749, 20 August 1953. 58ni Timoe Aiimict i05' 69 TOP SECRET Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 Approved for Release: 2017/12/06 C01267813 TOP SECRET (S) CIA estimated that the shortï¿½term prospects for Zahedi's government were good. \"Although many Iranians will regret the downfall of Mossadeq and will thus provide a source of future opposition to the new regime, most of this group will probably acquiesce at least temporarily in the change.\" The Tudeh Party lost much of its support in the upsurge of anti-Communist, pro-Shah sentiment. CIA thought the Tudeh unlikely to recover its support in the near future. Zahedi faced a formidable task in dealing with the disparate elements responsible for Mossadeq's dow"
