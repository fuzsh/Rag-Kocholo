This mission is a fdllow-up of the visit to Algiers of Mr Mohamed E1 Moktar Ould Zamel, Mauritanian minis*_er of industry and mines, during which this refinery question was the main topic - of the discussions. The Nouadhibou refinery, which an Austrian company built 3 years ago, including its entire equipment, cost around $140 million. It was to produce 1 million tons of refined oil per year. Mauritania, whose yQarly consumption exceeds 350,000 tons, counted on exporting the balance of its output to some neighboring countries. However, as it was not producing crude oil, Nouakchott signed a supply contract with Algeria whose \"light weight\" crude oil was more suitable for the Nouadhibou refinery. The contract was concl;uded at a time when Algeria and Mauritania werp in very close cooperation. The breach in relations between the two countries in 1976, an outcome of the fighttng in Western Sahara, prevented its fulfillment: the refinery, therefore, as it lacked supplies, could not begin to operate. Nigeria at the appointed time, was to supply the necessary oil, but the pro~ects, along these lines, were quickly abandoned because of operating expenses. The Austrian builder recently agreed to cut the invoice down $15 million. The Mauritanian Government requested Algerian assistance to insure the opening and procurement of supplies for a refinery considered in Nouakchott \"one of the most ill-starred inheritances\" left by the former gover,�nment.

This article argued that it was neces- sary \"to bar the way to sorcerer.`s apprentices, debunk the champione of ob- acurantism, den~ovnce ~he current flagrant abuse of a religion and the faith of a people, and neutralize those subversives who disguise their black subversive designs under the white veil of Islam.\" ~ Our correspondent Souhayr.Belhassen, author of a ma~or investigative repo~t on contentious Islam in Tunisia, tells us that Tunisian~;officials have been issuing a succession of warnings over the past few weeks. A veritable campaign has been launchedagainat what are termed \"pseudoreligious ~nd sub- versive movements.\" Mohamed Sayah, a PSD director, stated on Monday 10 De- ~ cember that \"under the cover of religion, this fundamental3st movement is acting in a manner harmful to religion and hoetile to the reformist move- ment which made its appearance very early in this century and whose torch- bearers are men like Bourguiba.\" Thus, after having long silently observed this fundamentaliat mo~~ement's rise, the goverriment decided to cross swords with the Moslem fundamentalists. Admittedly in late November some of the preaching in the mosques had taken on an openly political tone, and Islamic unive~sity students had become militant. It was under trese circumstances, that the movement's weekly newspaper, AL-MU.T'EAMA', was suspended for 3 months on 7 December. On Thurs- day 20 December, its editor, Rached Ghanouchi, was summoned to appear be- fore an examining magistrate. 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Wave of Religious Fervor Having attained a circulation of more than 20,000 lesa than 6 months af ter its first issue, AL ~IUITTAMA' was ind~ed a great popular auccesa. It in- directly; criticized the goverrnnent which it considered guilty of ~neglec- tinR Islam. Tt viewed the Iranian ravolutian ae exemplary. In ita last iesue, it publieh~d an interview with members of the delegation from Iran that had been preve:?Ced from making a atatement at ths Arab summit meeting in Tun3s on 20-22 November. The front page of that issue carried a pic~ure of Teheran students tearing up an American flag, and commentaries implicit- 1y approving the taking of the American hostages. _ This pro-Khomeyni slant--contrasting sharply with the goverim?ent's prudent attitude--coupled with c~-iticism of the regime accused of having committed the great \"crime\" of attacking the Islamic Zitouna University, obviously irritated President Bourguiba. \"Enough is enough\" was his reaction. After having shockingly discovered that the newspapers of the fundamenta~is~s were being printed on party presses, the president took Mohamed Sayah to task. Following which, the PSD director announced, in the first week of December, that he had received instructions from the chief of state to con- duct a campaign of explanation and clarification. The reaction of the Islamic leaders to all this was to brace themselvea and avoid any provocat~ons. In the meantime, moaque attendance continues to increase and people fervently listen to the preachinga of such men as Hassen Ghodbani or Abdelfateh Moro, two of the movement's principal leaders. _ The Tunisian regime is more overtly \"modernistic\" than the Algerian and Moroccan regimes. It has also taken a firmer principled position with re- gard to the religious revival. :'sut in Algiers, as in Rabat or Casablanca, _ there are equally old and large currents of Islamic ideas and sentiment. And, as is the case in Tunisia, these movements are now noticeably on the rise in combination with a resurgence of religious feeling among the masses. Like elsewhere in the Moslem world, it is difficult--in these early days of the 15th century after the Hegira--to distinguish between the religious ground swell, the \"fallout\" from the turbulence in Iran, and political _ protest. But everywhere there is a noticeable gap between the off icial views and the feelings of part of t3i~-population on the sub3ect of Iran, for example, or on the applicat~,on of the principles of Islam. Religious - fervor and social aspirations have become concomitant weapons in the hands of the \"militants of Islam.\" Wave of Political Protest In Algeria, for example, there is no movement similar to the overt Tunisian \"Islamic revival.\" Recently, however and particulat~y for the \"salat-a1- tarawih\" (prayers for the vigil of Rama.dan), the number of young people in the mosques has increased to an unusual extent. More and more men cax~ be seen wearing a sort of Egyptian \"galabiah,\" a flowing white robe heretofore 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY - unknown in Algeria but now worn as a religious symbol. The movement has gained the lycees [secondary schools]. In a number of these achools, stud- ents in the higher grades, traditionally less obaervant of religious prac- tices, have ~ompelled their teachers to etop classes during the houra of prayer eo aB to allow atudents to go to the moaque if they so desire, or to a room in the echool epecifically set aeide for thie purpose. Some observers even believe the religious movement influenced the recent strike--begun in late November and still continuing as of 22 December-- of some 3,000 \"Arabizing\" university students from the faculties of law and economics in Algiers protesting against the lack of adequa,te~ob oppor- tunities compared with those available to their fellow students following the bilingual (French and Arabic) curriculum. One of the graffiti on the walls of the student-housing build~ings asks: \"Is Algeria a French colony?\"\" ~ This student agitation did even nearly turn into anti-American demonstrations related to the Iranian crisis. And authorities fear that the fundamental- ists might succeed in mobilizing part of the youth against a regime which has praclaimed Islam as the state religion without making an effort to ' . really Islamize political life. Furthermore, the insistent deman~i for social ~ustice expressed by supporters of fundamentalist Islam has touched a sympathetic chord not only among the working class but among the middle class and intellectuals as well. For the ~ moment, the government does nat aeem to have a clear position on how to deal - with the phenomenon. Some politicians, such as Salah Yahiaoui, the FLN _ [National Liberation Front] coordinator, are suspected of \"flirting with the _ religious leaders.\" It ~aill be recalled, in this conaection, that on 1 May _ 1979, Yahiaoui publicly stated he opposed changing the official non-working day from Friday, whereas President Chadli had given instructions to return to observing that day on Sunday. The ct~ief of state ultimately had to re- treat and maintain the Friday ruling made by Houari Boumediene in 1976. Discreet Repression Neighboring Morocco is no e~t-~2e~tion to the rule. Our special correspondent, Mohamed Selhami, reports [in related article belowJ on the \"breakthrough\" fundamentalists have made in King Hassan II's country. Their progrese h2s been such that it has the government worried. Without taking positions as f irm as those taken in Tunisia, the goverrnnent does appear to ha-~~e initiated a policy of discreet repression, primarily so as to prevent the movement from extending into political matters. For in Morocco, perhaps more than in Tunisia and Algeria, the society outside the large urban centers has remained very deeply marlced by Islam. v Sunni Islam, the Maghreb's major3ty religion, is considered to be more con- ~ formist than Irar.ian Shiism. But could anyone possibly imagine that the Maghreb would hold itself aloof at a time when Tehran, Islamabad, and Mecca are stirring? Despite the diversity of the situatione, there is today in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia a Westernized elite suspicious of a movement - which questions its way of life, and frequently its privileges. 4 FOR OFFICIAL USE CiNLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Government leaders in Alg~ers, Rabat, an3 Tunis allowed some religious movements to prosper because it appeared these movements could serve as a check on \"politicization\" and as an assurance of stability for the govern- ment.

Situation in Morocco Paris JEUNE AFRIQUE in French 26 Dec 79 pp 36-37 [Article by Moha~ad Selhami: \"The Moraccan 'Brothers [Text] Jawad is 19, but with his r~haggy beard he looks like 30. He is a law student in Casablanca. But what makes Jawad eccentric is not his beard but his behavior. Each time he meets someone, he starts reciting verses frc+m the Koran which he interprets in rather terrifying terms: \"God forbida alcohol, gambling and pork.... Why not submit to divine la:w?\" There's nothing to criticize in that part of Jawad's interpretation. There have always been young and not so young fundamentalists who have upheld Koranic instructions. Rarely have they ever been heeded, and even much less feared. But Jawad does not limit h~mself to prohibitions. He goes far, very far, in his interpretations. For example, he condemns social in3ustice and calls upon people to revoJ,t. He also makes analyses that are an indictment of the Moroccan political system. \"Our land is a land of islam. The entire 'umnah' (nation) [community of believers] must benefit from it. It is not written that mortals can appropriate thousands of hectares, buildings, hous- ing, and rivers. Just as it is not written that other mortals cannot find even anything to eat.\" And 3awad named those to bl~ne for thjs~.\"An end must be put to their brutalities. God will help us fight the~m.\" \"Jawad is one of those people,\" others whispered to me. Who are \"thoae peo- ple ? The Mo~slem Brotherhood naturally! Yes! Thcse men who are getting a bad name in Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, and for a long time in Egypt, and re- cently in Saudi Arabia. There are some of them in Morocco too. Jawad is on, of \"those people\" and he makes no secret of it. \"I am an ikhwan (bro- ~ ther). 'God has so willed,\" he told us in a quiet voice and weighing his every word. Moslem Brotherhood Jawad lives in Lhe Oasis, a residential section of Casablanca. His father - is a senior executive in a construction company. This shows that the _ \"ikhwan~e\" can al,so come from middle-class intellectual circles. In fact, you see them everywhere. In Casablanca, but also in all Gf the kingdom's cities. There are hundreds oi them, perhaps thousands. Nobody has managed - to count them. New ones appear every day. \"Recruitment\" is easy. As Jawad explained it to us: \"No effort is needed to cor.vince others of the word of God. His word is convincing per se.\" 5 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Woe is he who ventures to hamper the preaching of the Moslem brothers. For - some of them are prepared to do anything for their cause. A number of Moroccans remember the assassination of Omar Benjelloun, a socialist mili- tant, on 18.December 1975. His death was attributed to Moslem brothers, many of whom were supporters of Shaykh Moti, a Moroccan who has since taken refuge in Saudi Arabia. But Morocco has other famous Shaykh Moti's, auch ae that school inspector, Abdessalam Yassine,who sent an open letter to the king. In it, he called upon the monarchy to show more respect for the pre- cepts of Islam. Shaykh Yassine was ~ailed and ti:en released. But on one - _ condition, namely that he act openly. He is currently the editor of a re- view in Marrakech, AL-JAMA'AH (the community). Return to Authenticity Most of these Moslem brothers are graduates of university faculties of Is- lamic law (Sharia) or the secular university. Some are even graduates of Western schools aad universities. All are militantly working for a return to Moslem authenticity.. For that reason, they reject all consumer goods \"invented by non-Moslems\" (television, motion pictures, dance halls, etc.). Jawad told us these are \"all ways and means likeiy to prevent human beings from believing in God and enternal life. Look at what this Western way of life leads to. It Ieads to pros1itution, corruption, thievery, and egoi~m.\" Jawad took us to a mosque in one of the sections on the outskirts of Casa- blanca, a former European and Jewish district. There is even a church there that has been converted into a mosque. When we commented on this transfor- mation, the imam replied: \"What does it matter? It was and still is the house of God.\" This imam was in hia thirties, a carpenter by trade, and had studied the \"Book\" at a very early age in a Koranic school. \"I didn't receive a diploma, but something better: faith in God and in his prophet Muhammad,\" he explained. In this gloomy and cold mosque, some 40 of the faithful began reciting the evening prayer. \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great), they repeated in unison. Some 5 minutes later, they were all seated in a circle facing the imam. I~'or nearly an hour, the holy man preached and recited a Hadith dealing with - hutnan injustice. Nobody moved. His remarks were entirely political. It was almost like listening fio an opposition member of parliament fiercely at- tacking the goverrwent. The imam spare~ only one persen, the king. This was no oversi:ghr. The imam later exp:~ained to us that his sovereign was a man highly devoted to Islam,, \"He is the descendant oi Sidna Muha~ad. Criticizing him means belittling the prophet's family.\" In contrast, the imam was sharply critical of certain persons in the king's entuurage, in- cluding some ministers \"who give him bad advice.\" Local authorities do not consider this imam dangerous. Others, definitely few in number, are much more dangerous because they blame the king. \"That report is ir_correct.

They are no more religious than Fidel Castro.\" This same official also denied that the police were taking represaive mea- sures against this pehnomenon. Nevertheless, according to many witneRSes, auch repression did begin about 4 months ago. Some 100 \"fanatica\" are alleged to have been detained for queationing. Most of them are said to have been subsequently released. There are reports of some 10 arrests in Ou3 da . Contain the Phenomenon? One thing is certain: authorities are determined to contain this phenomenon. These are the same authorities who not so long ago were officially protecting the \"Moslem brothers.\" Now, however, they fear that with democratic exper- ience these brothers may organize and constitute a united force. The coun- try's current critical social situation is conducive to their expansion. Moroccans are not very politicized but they are devoted to their religion. Hence they are extremely sensitive to any propaganda based on Islam. This explains why it is so easy for the Moslem brothers to recruit their follow- ers. They have no need to appeal to pro-Khomeyni sentiment. Furthermore, ~ unlike Shiite Iran, Morocco is Sunnite. The ikhwane's preaching is based on ~ the land and Islam. When one realizes what these two words represent to 80 percent of the Moroccans....

Neither a fundamentalist Muslim nor a Max~tist, he was one , of the organizers of the rebellion that led to the downfall of the Pahlavi dynasty. He has decided to continue his fight in Tehran, but in order to tell his ver~ic�*~ of the truth about the Iran of Ayatollah Khomeyni, he was forced then and now to conceal his identity. [Question] You are one ~f th~ heroes of the revolution. Why are you forced to hide in order to speak? [Answer] Under the shah, if I had been killed, they would have known that the Savak did it. Today, there is such confusion in Iran that it is very easy to kill anyone who criticiaes the regime. I do not que~tion the official - authorities, but the extremists: the guardians of the revolution, the committees or the different armed groups, who are often instigators. - [Question] At the present time, the Kurdish question is bathing Iran in blood. Can Khomeyni survive tr.is massacre? ~ [Answer] If we do not grant autonomy, not only to Kurdistan, but to the different national minorities makin~ up half ot the population, the civil war that has already begun will spread throughout the country.

[Ar~ =PrJ Westerners are against our revolution; that is natural. They lost $9G .,illion, more than in any other cataclysm since World War II. If their business Were as good as it was under the shah, they~WOUld not give a hang about defending our freedom! Now then, very serious things are happening in Iran. Human rights are being trampled. I publicly pratest~d the revolu- tionary tribunals. That 400 persons sr~ould have been execLted is normal: They uere responsible for the massacre of tens of thousands of people. But that ~the cou~ts should deliberate in secret and that there should be no right of defEnse is inadmissib~.e, especially since the competency of the courts vas recently extended to include any \"counterrevolutionary\" crime, Whet?~er political or economic. The.term is very vague and one can call anything counterrevolutionary one wants. _ [Question] Khomeyni had most ne~snen imprisoned and has banned nearly all the leftist parties, declaring that they were plotting against the regime. What is y~ur opinion? [Answer] In Nad~av, when he was in exile in Iraq, and in Paris, Khomeyni ~ officially stated that all newspapers and all p?rties would be frea, parti- cularly the lef tist parties. I~n absolutely opposed to the current proce- dure. If a newspaper or party \"plots,\" the government prosecutes him and a civil tribunal must decide whether the accusation is Well-founded. If the regime can carry out such arbitrary bans, we have come right back to the situation that existed under the shah. The shah said that ia lran, every freedom existed except the freedom to betray and for him, betraying meant not being in agreement with him. Now it is said that anything is permitted _ except plotting, and plotting means criticiaing the regime in poWer. It is exactly the same thing, but before they said \"treason\" and now they say \"conspiracy\"! [Question] Your account is all the more important because you come from a r~~ligious family, but without being involved in the struggle betWeen the political groups. [AnswerJ I am a democrat above all and I respect democrats, whether they be Muslims or leftists. I was first of all a member of Mosaddeq's National . Front and then, in 1963, when all parties were banned, I continued my fight alone. I have fought fascism for 27 years. I now continue to fight another form of fascism. I shall fight until we obtain fundamental freedoms in I~-an, no matter what price I have to pay. 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY [Question] Do you not think it would be more effective to work within the _ government in order to try to change its policies? [Answer] No, because unfortunately, the government does not have great _ - power. The banning of newspapers and parties, the secret trials, the exe-~ cutions, are not decisions of the government. Often it is not even aware of them. I worries only about current affairs. Anything that has to do with _ policies i~ decided by the Revolutionary Council and the religious authori- ties. [Question] Then why does Baaargan remain prime minister? [Answer] Because he fears that if he r~signs, there will be civil war every- where. Baaargan is a deeply honest man, a true democrat. He Was esteemed by the left as Well as by the religious leaders. Unfortunately, he is grad- _ ually losing his prestige. He cannot do much and no one in his place would be able to do more becaus~ the government has no decision-making poWers. [Question) Un~ortunately, the Iranian experience seems to prove that those who claim that sn Islamic republic can be nothing but revolutionary are right. [Answer] What is happening in Iran is the result of 25 years of a dictator- ship. We have no democratic traditions; the people who are leading us have retained the same ways they kneW under the shah and his father. But actually, an Islamic republic must be a democratic republic. A true Muslim has the duty to criticiae if he believes that something is unjust, even the imam, even the Prophet. [Question] Even th~ Prophet? . [AnswerJ Yes. During the early days of Islam, Muhammad, his son-in-law Ali and Omar, the second caliph, were even criticized in the mosque. Today, one - should be able to criticite Khomeyni. If he is a true Muslim, he must accept it. [Question) Not only does he not accept it, but he is demanding a single party. [Answer] Then we sha11 have the same situation as under the shah, Who only authorized the imperial party. I hope that Khomeyni will give up this - position. Otherwise, the whole revolution wil~ have been nothing more than a change in facade. [QuestionJ But the people are with Khomeyni. [Answer] That is true. All the peasants, the people in tne markets, most of the lower middle class, half of the workers and part of the students folloW the ayatollah because they are religious but also because they profited from the revolution materially or hope to profit from it.

The role of the intellectual minority is very important. It began the strug- gle against the shah and it is the intellectuals that can recommence the fight for human rights. [Question] Bakhtiar also says lze favors democracy. Do you believe he has any cbance in Iran? - [Answer] No. He is a nationalist, but he made many mistakes �~hen he was prime minister. Above all, everyone knoWS he Was chosen by the Americans i~i order to try to prevent the advent of Khomeyni. The people will never ~forget this. [Question] In the final analysis, do you regret the revolution? [Answer] Certainly not. Our country was completely dependent, politically and economically, on the West, which greu rich at our expense. We totally lost our pride, our identity. You cannot imagine hoW much our people have changed in a year of fighting. No one used to dare to spealc; everyone Was afraid. Now, despite the danger, the people criticize and rebel.

Not unly because no Mosle~ country, even though it may be far from Saudi Arabia, can remain indifferent to the outbreak of a bloody revolt in the midst of an annua~ pilgrimag-~ and inside Islam's holiest ahrine. Not ~ only becauae the former Sharifian Empire is already experiencing a wave of Islamic protest. Not only becaus~e the Wahhabi and Alawhite kingdoms have establish~d a thousand and one affective and pol~.tical relationa be- tWeen themselves. But for more specifiG and circumstantial reasons. - Ben~elloun Case In fact, J~UNE AFRIQUE is in a position to reveal that at least three Moroc- can nationals have been jailed following the fighting in the A1-Haramal Sharif mosque and that one of them is not unknown in Morocco. He is Abdelkrim Moti whose name was widely mentioned after the assassination of Omar Benjelloun, one of the most well-known leaders of the USFP tSocialist , Union of Popular Forces). The maltreaicment to which he had been sub~ected and his regeated periods of impriso~ent--he was sentenced to death in 1964 and subsequently pardoned--had not dimwed the combative spirit of thia fiery leader of the Moroccan left. Ever sia~ce his party's January 1975 congress, he had been arguing in favor of an openly legalistic strategy. On 18 Decem- ber 1975, however, he was fatally wounded by two individuals. One shattered his skull with an iron bar while the other stabbed him in the heart with a sharp sho~maker's tool. The police showed great diligence and arreated the murderera and their immediate accomplices. The investigation quickly revealed that they were merely \"hit men\" whose motives remained obscure. They were not even acquainted with \"Omar\" whom everqbody knew. They belonged to a cell of Mosiem activists bcit nothing in the USFP leader's action or views could account for the9.r murderous attack on him. The persons ques- ' tioned--they were young men--implicated Abdelkrim Moti as inatigator of the crime. But Moti hac~ already been able to flee from Morocco and take refuge in Saudi Arabia. 18 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ~ APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000200040053-7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Moti Suspected - Moti was in his forties and a school inspector. He had been highly active - in the ranks of a labor union in the educational sector and also within the UNFP [National Union of Populr~r Forces~ (the future USFP). lie made a _ pilgrimage to Mecca in the late 1960's and returned to Morocco a changed man. Very aoon thereafter he removed himself from all militant labor union activity and leftist politics to head an organization called Moslem Youth . whose organizational structure rema~ned quite nebulous. The organization distributed leaflets calling upon people to combat \"evil.\" But it careful- ly avaided attacking the goverrnnent. Its supporters preferred to violently attack m~~bers of the new (Marxist-Leninist) left who had become active in university faculties in the early 1970's. One of the new left's leaders who had \"tangled\" with them back in those days told us: \"In our opinton, Moti's gang appeared to be encouraged hy the police.\" Nevertheless, was Moti actually involved in Omar Benjelloun's assassina- tion? Was he not simply a convenient scapegoat in this \"second Ben Barka case\"? From his Saudi exile, Moti hae never ceased protesting his inno- cence in a variety of ways. He ha.s had a denial published in the Kuwaiti press. He has sent messages to USFP leaders. In one of his writings, he acknowledged that he was asked to organize Omar Benjelloun's assassination, but claims he declined. In short, everything indicates that determination _ of the truth demands that he be heard by the inveatigators, but oddly enough, = no action has been taken to do this. Some additional elements have heightened the confusion and misgivings of all those who are following this case. Last year, a fugitiv~ named Naamani was arrested as he was trying to leave the country. According to the atate- menCs made by those accused of the crime, Naamani had transmiti:~d Moti's orders to the perpetrators of Ben~elloun's assassination. Naamani's arrest was considered important enough to be immediately and officia.lly xeported to the USFP leadership. But this important \"capture\" produced no clarify- ing developments in the case because, mysteriously enough, the accuaed was never brought before an examining magistrate. Furthermore, the official record of the interrogation of the accused disap.peared. This record noted the relations both Moti and Naamani had had with \"high-level Moroccan of- f icials,\" relations also mentioned in other documents in the case. Despite ' these irregularities, the trial was scheduled to resume on 10 December 1979. Defense lawyers did not fail to invoke those irregularities in requesting and obtaining a postponement. Myatery Remains A contradictory impression emerges from all of the above considerations. It definitely seems that among those officials in charge of the investi~ation there are some who are doing their work properly while others persist in try- ing to obstruct the orderly process of ~ustice. Yet now the main figure in the case has been arrested by the Saudi authorities.

Fortunately, it was only a false alarm. Led before the examining magistrate, Simone Ben Othman realized that this meant a sentence in absentia delivered in August 1974 (on the same occasion that her husband was judged and sentenced for the second time). She was told that she could appeal the sentence and that meanwhile she was out on ' bail. As a matter of fact, the state police court would have to meet to settle the matter.

For Gilbert Naccache, agricultural expert, a native of Tunis, who had completed 9 of the 17 and 1/2 years to which he was sentenced, it is hard to find work. But the official who made out his identification card for him did him a favor. He furnished him with the job af day laborer instead of listing him as unemployed--which at the time of police raids, would have meant a stint in prison.
