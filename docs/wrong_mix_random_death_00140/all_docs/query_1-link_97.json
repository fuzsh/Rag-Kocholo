        "text": "On October 16, 1971, the Shah of Iran inaugurated the Shahyad Aryamehr Monument. Less than nine years later, with Iran engulfed in the revolutionary events of 1979, the Shah would catch one last glimpse of this structure while leaving for exile. The Shah lost to the revolutionaries, the Pahlavi legacy gave way to the Islamic Republic, and Shahyad was refashioned as the symbolic monument of the revolution, and renamed Azadi (Freedom). This thesis explores the projection of this monument’s image by the Pahlavi monarchy and later its usage and appropriation by the Islamic Republic to explain its greater role in Iranian cultural politics of nation building. By examining the different ways in which the monument was fashioned, re-fashioned and represented this thesis demonstrates that Shahyad/Azadi played a central role within larger efforts of two Iranian regimes to define the nation’s past, present, and future. Keywords: Shahyad; Azadi; Architecture; Tehran; Iran; Mohammad Reza Pahlavi\n\nIsraeli-Iranian relations remain a mystery to most analysts in spite of the profound impact that these countries’ tensions have had on the Middle East and on U.S. national security. The political sensitivity of the issue has prompted most U.S. experts to refrain from studying the subject in detail. Instead, the poor state of relations between these two former allies has been treated either as an inexplicable phenomenon or as purely the result of deep-seated ideological antagonism. All the while, its impact on U.S. foreign policy has been conveniently ignored at a great cost to U.S. national interests. While it is widely believed that the key to peace in the Middle East is the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, little attention has been given to the key geopolitical rivalry between Israel and Iran, which has had a decisive influence on this and other regional conflicts.\n\nHow one-man Khomeini, created a radical Islamic dictatorship, the Bloody purges of thousands of Iranian people, the governmental structure of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the various governmental directorates, how officials are placed into power and removed, the matrix of Islamic Theocratic Totalitarian state of Tehran. Khomeini’s theocratic government principle of guardianship of the jurisprudent was kept hidden until after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\nThe tension between “modernization” and “rights” defined the relationship between Americans and Iranians from the 1950s through the 1970s. The dynamic interplay between these two transnational currents is best understood through the lens of international education. U.S. policy makers envisaged Western-educated Iranians as the bastion of pro-Americanism required to provide the cultural underpinnings of the Washington–Tehran alliance. But the influx of Iranian students to American campuses globalized U.S. institutions of higher education and, in the process, produced an alternate alliance of Iranian youths and progressive Americans that rejected Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s authoritarian model of development, called for the realization of human rights in Iran, and revealed the contradictions inherent in a U.S. strategy that promoted student exchange while at the same time supporting the shah as an agent of modernization and anti-Communism.\n\nA short article review based on the video documentary \"Iran and the West\", for an individual assignment for the course SSA 3014: Introduction to International Law.

This paper reviews the relationship between nationalism, political developments, and the rise and progress of archaeology in Iran from the mid 19th century to the present. The Iranian reaction to foreign interference is investigated here, and the role Iran’s past has played in reinforcing nationalist sentiments is explored. It is argued that whenever the political situation provided a favorable environment, intellectuals and politicians, in various capacities, have exploited the archaeological and historical record, especially those of the Achaemenid and Sasanian empires, to advocate their nationalist agendas. This paper concludes with an assessment of the recent manifestations of Iranian nationalism in the postrevolutionary era, and its utilization of Iran’s history and recent sociopolitical transformations."
