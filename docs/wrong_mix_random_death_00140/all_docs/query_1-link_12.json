        "text": "There were nightclubs and bars. People mixed freely. Women could dress however they wanted: tight jeans, mini-skirts, hair loose. The king drove around in a luxury Cadillac, appeared to have a soft spot for Ray Ban sunglasses and wanted to modernize just about everything.\n\nBut this Iran that existed before the Islamic Revolution of 1979 was also a deeply traditional place, divided between oil money and poverty, with few social advancements for most people. It was a place where the ruling royal family held absolute power, There were abuses and political repression, including, for a time, with assistance from the U.S. government in the form of the CIA.\n\nA look at this era in Iran's history will be on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for six weeks starting Oct. 13. The Museum will screen more than 70 Iranian movies from 1925 to 1979 and offer, according to the program's lead curator, Ehsan Khoshbakht, a view of the \"many Irans\": complex, diverse, caught between competing impulses. And in many cases, in love with American culture.\n\nIt is a look at a U.S. adversary that often makes headlines − because of prisoner swaps, protests over human rights abuses, jailed Nobel Peace Prizing-winning activists and on-and-off nuclear negotiations. And it is close at heart to the estimated 620,000 people of Iranian ancestry who live in the U.S.\n\nImprisoned. Defiant: Now Iran's Narges Mohammadi is a Nobel Peace Prize winner\n\nIn recent days, rights groups have urged Iranian authorities to explain how a 16-year-old girl named Armita Geravand fell into a coma after an alleged encounter on a train with Iran's so-called morality police − evoking comparisons with Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died in police custody last year after being accused of violating Iran’s hijab rules, which require women to cover their hair. After Amini's death, Iran passed a new \"hijab and chastity\" law that comes with fines and lengthy prison terms for breaking it.\n\nPrisoner swap: 5 Americans released for 5 Iranians\n\nInside Iran: America’s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness\n\nThis is an edited version of an interview with Khoshbakht about what the museum describes as \"the most comprehensive survey of Iranian pre-revolutionary cinema ever assembled in North America.\"\n\nWhat do these movies say about Iran?\n\n\"Imagine someone watching all these films back-to-back,'' Khoshbakht said. \"The conclusion could be something like this: The country starts to grow. It marches toward modernization. It's exciting. And as it progresses, many contradictions appear.\n\nThen this thing − this massive machine that's been moving forward − it starts to crack and break down and suddenly it explodes in 1979.\n\nIn these films you see a country that still preserves its very old ways of life in the 1920s. Then, after World War II, you see how much has changed; how modern or modern-looking it has become. In the 1950s, you see the optimism. The desire for change. You see an Americanized vision of life, where Iranians drive American cars, subscribe to magazines and drink coffee. Gradually, a middle class is being formed.\n\nBut the films are also ahead of society. They create dream visions of that middle class life for Iranians. They are feeding into the imagination in terms of how life in Iran could be. But they also see the dark side of this progress, those contradictions. Girls in mini-skirts who are also wearing chador (a body-length cloak that covers the hair and body, worn especially by Muslim women) − and you ask yourself: Who are we? Are we modern or traditional?\n\nIran's women: Hijabs, Instagram and protests\n\nI'll give you a good example. At a time when the Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty (Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran's last king) was promoting the idea of progress − of Iran's bright future − a short documentary is made called The House is Black (1963, directed by Forugh Farrokhzad). It's about a leper colony that is an allegory for Iranian society. It features the under-represented, the under-class. It asks: Why if Iran is building so many hospitals, schools, universities, public television, why is there also so much poverty and illness?\"\n\nWhat was censorship like for Iranian movie directors before the revolution − and what is it like now, in modern-day Iran?\n\n\"Censorship has been part of Iranian cinema since its inception. Both censorship of foreign films to be screened in Iran and productions made domestically. Of course, censorship reached an unprecedented level after the revolution but it is important to emphasize it did exist before the revolution, too. It started to tighten its grip in the late 1950s when SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, became more powerful and extended its influence over different aspects of Iranian life and culture. SAVAK, for example, forced director Masoud Kimiai to shoot a completely new ending for his movie The Deer (1974), a tale of a former sports champion turned junkie who reunites with a leftist classmate and is redeemed by revolutionary anger.\"\n\nYet even films by directors who were relatively close to the Pahlavi regime were censored. The best example of this from the time is South of the City (1957, directed by Farokh Ghafari). It was completely mutilated by censorship because it was one of the very first films in Iran shot on location showing the true conditions of the people − the poverty, gangsters, crime, prostitution. It showed how Tehran really was.\n\nToday, young Iranian filmmakers have the possibility to self-produce their films by using digital technologies. They can send their films to international film festivals without involving the state. Of course, if they want to shoot and screen their films in Iran they still need permission. They are subjected to censorship and state control. But it seems that many directors are even abandoning the idea of domestic release, so they can say what they want to say without censoring themselves. Some seem willing to risk arrest to do this.\"\n\nU.S.-Iran pact: Trump destroyed it. Biden wants to restore it. Just don't call it a deal\n\nWill some of these movies seem familiar to Americans?\n\n\"For Western viewers, especially American ones, there's likely to be a deep familiarity about some of these films. There are many Iranian directors who were influenced by American cinema and do their own versions of Americans films. For example, Samuel Khachikian (Anxiety, 1962; Strike, 1964) has been dubbed Iran's Alfred Hitchcock. His films are very much in the style of American film noir and crime thrillers from the 1950s. They are extremely enjoyable to watch. The lighting, acting and editing techniques are those of classical Hollywood.\n\nThere's another film in this series showing at MoMA (Reza Motori, 1970, directed by Masoud Kimiai) that is pretty much a straight homage to Easy Rider (the 1969 American road movie starring Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper). The American influence is very visible and beautiful in an exhilarating way.\"\n\nWhat do you think Americans will find surprising about these movies?\n\n\"Many Americans who see these movies will be surprised to learn that there's not just one Iran. There's many. The sun-drenched Iran of the south. The green Iran of the north. The ancient central Iran. Different climates, different complexions, different moods, different types of music, different languages, backgrounds. Directors of Jewish origins like Gorji Ebadia (The Girl from Saari, 1963), directors of Armenian origins like Khachikian, Muslim directors − it's a real melting pot. It can change someone's perspective just to look at these films.\n\nIt's the shock of discovery. It can be very rewarding.\n\nI also think that by watching these films you are able to see and discover some of the factors that contributed to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. As they move from the late 1950s to the 1970s, in particular, you get a sense, bit by bit, of how these films are mirroring what's happening in Iranian society. You see signs of the revolution to come. This, for me, is the greatest aspect of these films: they were already aware of the change that was going to happen. There's an increasing sense of angst and a blind violence. That hopelessness and pessimism often appears in the stories of revenge and rebellion. Films by Kimiai are good examples. Other films like Chess of the Wind (1976, directed by Mohammad Reza Aslani) also that have that premonition of the revolution to come.\"\n\nIran’s Jewish community: The largest in the Mideast outside Israel\n\nWhat happened to all these movie directors after the revolution?\n\n\"The majority of the directors who were still alive and working in 1979 they found themselves out of work. Many of them, especially the art house directors, went abroad to America, Canada, France. Some never returned. Some returned, cautiously. People such as Naderi, Abbas Kiarostami, Bahram Beyzaie and Dariush Mehrjui. These were the directors who planted the seed for a rebirth of Iranian cinema after the revolution.\n\nState institutions such as Iran's National Television, Kanoon, the ministry of culture, organizations that all backed films through financial aid and were all the creation of the Pahlavi era, these were not immediately demolished after the revolution. The knowledge, expertise and technology to make films − some great, fascinating films − was still there. Naderi's The Runner (1984), produced by Kanoon, became the first major Iranian film in the post-revolutionary period that had a long festival run all around the world. But it was directed by a man who before the revolution made gritty crime films. After relocating to the U.S., Naderi made A, B, C…Manhattan (1997), Marathon (2002) and Sound Barrier (2005). (Set in New York, they all deal themes of isolation and alienation).\"\n\nWhat is the connection between the portrayals of Iranian women in these movies and the 'Woman, life, liberty' protests in Iran?\n\n\"The majority of these films show a victimized image of women. But toward the end of the 1970s the films of Aslani and Beyzaie in particular show an alternative image of women that is dazzling, feminist and was truly shocking to Iranian audiences at the time. The Stranger and the Fog (1975, directed by Beyzaie) is a film that shows how victimized Iranian women in the 1970s could take charge of their own destinies.\n\nThe Ballad of Tara (1979, also by Beyzaie) is like a feminist manifesto. It ends with a woman armed with a sword fighting against waves that roll in from the sea on a beach. It's one of the most powerful endings in the history of cinema. In the taking up that sword, there is a rejection of the patriarchy and one can't help but think of the \"Woman, life, liberty\" protests in Iran (sparked in September 2022 by the death in police custody of Amini, who was detained for \"improper\" hijab-wearing).\n\n'Woman, life, liberty': Iranians on why they'll risk beatings and death for change\n\nIran said to close 'morality police': The truth is more thorny\n\nIt is about empowerment and emancipation being crushed by the most brutal state violence imaginable. When the actor of Tara, Susan Taslimi, gazes into the camera she puts forward the question Iranian women today have started to answer in a loud and clear voice: the oppression is the crushing wave she fights with her sword. Now women choose their own destiny and appear not in chador or mini-skirt, but as they are: free and determined.\"\n\nA full program of the Iranian movies being shown at The Museum of Modern Art is available here.\n\nThe series runs until Nov. 30."
