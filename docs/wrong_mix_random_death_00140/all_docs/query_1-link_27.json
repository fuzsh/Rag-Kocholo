        "text": "It isnt clear whether Bettes December 8, 2013 comment on Twitter meant that this was the first she had ever heard that the U.S. helped destroy a democratic government in Iran, or simply her delayed reaction to the news that the CIA had finally admitted to their hand in it four months prior (probably the latter).\n\nIn any case, the Hawaiian-born entertainer is not as far removed from that 60 year old episode  occurring when she was age seven  as one might assume.\n\nOn at least a couple occasions, Midler posed for celebrity photographer Firooz Zahedi, whose opportunistic Uncle, General Fazlollah Zahedi, replaced Mossadegh as Premier after the violent military coup nurtured by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nBorn in 1949, Firooz Zahedi was nine when his family moved to England. In 1969, he relocated to Washington, DC, and began a diplomatic career as an attaché in the Iranian Embassy. His cousin Ardeshir Zahedi, Irans Ambassador to the U.S., ruled the roost at the embassy, consorting with high society types, dignitaries and celebrities on a regular basis. At the embassy, Ardeshir introduced Firooz to film legend Elizabeth Taylor, whom he was romantically with involved at the time.\n\nLiz took a liking to the young budding artist. When Ms. Taylor visited Iran in May 1976 at Ardeshirs invitation, Firooz also accompanied her, shooting a series of photographs which would later form a 2011 exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nAfter that crucial foot-in-the-door, and Liz Taylors friendly prodding that he pursue this avenue further, Firooz embarked on a career as a Hollywood photographer. Taylor, who Zahedi calls my guardian angel, then hired him as her personal photographer on a movie set. He moved to Los Angeles and the rest is history. I owe my career to her, admits Zahedi.\n\nDiplomacy itself is an art because you learn to be totally someone you really are not. You have to be constantly gracious and polite and know how to bulls**t. Well that training certainly helped me in Hollywood!!\n\nAnother significant early stepping stone for Zahedi was the golden opportunity to work for Andy Warhol, whom he also met through his family network. Warhol actually published his first set of photos in Interview magazine — the ones he took of Liz Taylor in Iran, and assigned him to be Interviews Washington DC correspondent.\n\nListen: Andy Warhol in Iran\n\nThe iconic artist and noted fame-whore had his own Persian excursion in 1976, in response to a personal invitation to the Shahs palace in Tehran. Warhols editor Bob Colacello, who accompanied him, was impressed with what he saw in Iran. It reminded me of Beverly Hills, except that they had Persian carpets by their pools, he observed.\n\nWarhols connections with the royal circle rivaled even that of his new Iranian underling. He was a frequent guest at their functions, and in one case, the guest of honor at a Warhol-themed party thrown by Ardeshir Zahedi, complete with Campbells soup decor. Warhol was very chummy with both Queen Farah, who collected his work, as well as Princess Ashraf. Another Warhol collector in the royal camp, UN Ambassador Fereydoon Hoveyda, arranged for a series of flattering Warhol portraits of the Shah, Empress Farah, and Ashraf. Association with royalty has its privileges.\n\nWithout question, all of these glamorous developments can be traced back to the Zahedis power grab in 1953. Firooz Zahedis own father, Nasrollah, was allegedly implicated in an earlier attempt to overthrow Mossadeghs government. The charge came after the gruesome murder of Mossadeghs loyal police chief, Mahmoud Afshartous. In 2012, The New York Times claimed Nasrollah played a role in the coup itself, though we cannot confirm any of these charges. [Wire reports identified him as Fazlollah Zahedis nephew or nephew by marriage, which is both chronologically impossible and nonsensical. As Firooz and Ardeshir are cousins, this makes Fazlollah Zahedi (Ardeshirs father) his uncle].\n\nAssociated Press on May 4, 1953:\n\nIn a communiqué Saturday, the government charged that Zahedis nephew, retired Brig. Gen. Nasrollah Zahedi, had been a leader in the plot. The uncle was asked to visit the police within 48 hours.\n\nHad there never been a 1953 coup in Iran, there is an excellent chance that Bette Midler would never have found herself posing for a Zahedi. But then, a lot of things would be different if America had chosen its Friends more wisely..."
