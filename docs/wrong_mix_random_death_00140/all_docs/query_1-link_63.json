On this vulnerable, lyrical journey Zaree considers the impact of trauma on the bodies and souls of survivors and their children, leading her to question how her generation can relate to their own history while also respecting the people they love who prefer to heal in silence.\n\nWinner Best Film, Perspektive Deutsches Kino, Berlinale 2019.\n\nAbout Maryam Zaree\n\nMaryam Zaree was born in 1983 in Teheran/Iran. Fleeing political persecution, her mother brought Maryam with her to Germany when she was two. She grew up in Frankfurt am Main and studied acting in the renowned film school Konrad-Wolf in Potsdam Babelsberg. She has played lead roles in a dozen feature films, worked for theatre and Television and has been awarded for her performances. Born in Evin is her debut feature film."
