        "text": "People and Culture\n\nIran’s average annual population growth rate was estimated at 0.72 percent in 2001. This was a dramatic decrease from the 3.9 percent average annual increase documented in the 1980s, when the leaders of the Islamic Revolution encouraged families to have as many children as possible. They also amended laws so that girls as young as 9 years old could get married. The subsequent population explosion—an increase from 39 million people in 1979 to more than 55 million in 1990—soon exceeded the capacity of the country’s resources. The government instituted a progressive family planning program, leading to the largest decline in population growth in the world. Iran’s population growth accelerated somewhat during the early 21st century. In 2016 its growth rate stood at 1.18 percent, just slightly above the world average.\n\nEthnic Groups and Languages\n\nIran is a culturally diverse society consisting of numerous ethnic groups. People of Persian descent make up the largest group, at about 35 percent of the population. Farsi, as the Persian language is called, is the official language. It is named after the province of Fars, or Parsa, in what was once the center of the Persian Empire.\n\nThe largest of Iran’s minority groups are the Azerbaijani and the Kurds. The Azerbaijani are a Turkic people who live near the border with Azerbaijan in the northwestern corner of Iran. The Kurds live in the Zagros Mountains in the west as well as the Khorasan region in the northeast. The Kurds of western Iran, along with their fellow Kurds in adjacent regions of Iraq and Turkey, have sought either regional self-government or the establishment of an independent Kurdish state. Also inhabiting the western mountains are the Lurs, thought to be the descendants of the country’s first people, and the closely related Bakhtyari. The Baloch are a smaller minority who make their homes in the southeastern region known as Balochistan, which extends into Pakistan. Semitic peoples—Jews, Assyrians, and Arabs—make up only a small percentage of the population. The Jews live mainly in the largest cities, the Assyrians in the northwest, and the Arabs in the southwest.\n\nReligion\n\nIslam is the official religion of Iran, and the vast majority of the Iranian people belong to the Shiʿite branch. They regard Mashhad, in the northeast, as a holy city because it is the site of the tomb of ʿAli ar-Rida, the eighth imam, or leader, of Shiʿism. Another holy city is Qom. A small number of Iranians belong to the Sunni sect of Islam. Zoroastrianism (the religion of ancient Persia), Christianity, and Judaism are recognized by the state as official religious minorities, and each religion has a relatively small number of followers. There are also a small number of individuals who follow the Bahaʾi faith; however, all Bahaʾi institutions have been banned in Iran since 1983.\n\nCustoms\n\nDaily life in modern Iran is closely tied to Shiʿite Islam. After the establishment of the Islamic republic in 1979, the country’s religious leaders strictly enforced Islamic laws and customs. Among other restrictions, they required women to wear the traditional all-covering black garment, called a chador, in public and segregated boys and girls in separate schools. This strict interpretation of Islamic law did not sit well with the middle- and upper-class women in Iranian cities who had enjoyed the more liberal policies of the Pahlavi dynasty that had come before. In power since the 1920s, the Pahlavi monarchs had downplayed the role of religion in public life while allowing Western influences into Iran. In the 1930s, for example, Reza Shah Pahlavi imposed a European dress code and required women to stop wearing veils.\n\nFollowing the 1979 revolution, the new government assembled groups to patrol the streets to ensure that Islamic law was being followed. Violations, such as failure to observe the dress code, could result in arrest and harsh punishment, such as flogging. In the 1990s, however, the fervor of the early revolutionary years began to give way to demands for political moderation and better relations with the West, especially after the election of the reformer Mohammed Khatami as president in 1997. The dress code and rules regarding the segregation of the sexes were relaxed. Islamic law remained in place, however, and at times more conservative leaders have called for more active enforcement.\n\nIran is one of only two countries (the other being Afghanistan) that uses the Islamic solar calendar, which originated before the beginning of the Persian Empire (550 bc). After the conversion of the vast majority of Iranians to Islam, the ancient Iranian calendar was adjusted to begin with the year of the Prophet Muhammad’s immigration to Medina (the hijrah), equivalent to ad 622 in the Gregorian calendar. No-ruz (New Year’s Day) falls on March 21, the vernal equinox. To convert from the Islamic solar calendar to the Gregorian calendar, 621 or 622 years—depending on the month—are added to the Iranian year. (For example, the Iranian year 1361 began on March 21, 1982, and ended on March 20, 1983.) The Arabic lunar calendar is used for religious observances.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is free and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 11. Primary education is followed by a three-year guidance cycle, which assesses students’ aptitudes and determines whether they will follow an academic, science, or vocational program during high school. With the revolution of 1979 came new policies for education, including the elimination of mixed-sex schools and the requirement that all schools and universities reflect Islamic beliefs. Iran’s main institution of higher learning is the University of Tehran, founded in 1934. All of the other major cities also have public universities. The largest private institution of higher education is the Islamic Azad University, with branches in more than 100 cities.\n\nCities\n\nAbout three-fourths of Iran’s people live in cities or towns.Iranian cities were traditionally enclosed by high mud walls that gave access through colorful patterned gateways made of glazed tiles. The practitioners of each craft occupied their own section in the bazaar, or market district. An Iranian house, no matter how poor the occupants were, had a garden enclosed by a mud wall. The garden was a miniature landscape, laid out formally with a tiled pool in the center.\n\nTehran, the capital, is the largest city and the commercial center of Iran. It lies on the Plateau of Iran, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of the Caspian Sea. Tehran’s wide, tree-lined streets are crowded with traffic. The city still has some of its traditional character, but large Western-style apartment buildings and other structures have given it a mostly modern appearance. Karaj, a suburb of Tehran, also ranks among Iran’s largest cities.\n\nEsfahan, the 17th-century capital, is one of the most important architectural centers in the Islamic world. Tabriz, in the northwest, has traditionally been the trade center for the country’s rich agricultural region of Azerbaijan. Little remains of the great Persian Empire except the lonely ruins of Persepolis, in the south.\n\nHistory\n\nIran has more than 2,500 years of recorded history, yet its foundations as a modern state were not laid until the beginning of the 20th century. From the days of Cyrus the Great, during the 6th century bc, to the early 20th century, Iran was ruled by absolute monarchs. The shahanshah (king of kings), or emperor, decided the fate of the empire. Even the Islamic rulers of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties, which governed the country during most of the period from the 16th century to the 1920s, considered themselves the Shadow of God, the vice-regent of God on Earth. The Safavids, because of their descent from a family that was considered saintly, enjoyed a degree of spiritual authority that the Qajars did not have.\n\nPolitically, Iranian history can be divided into nine major periods: the Achaemenian dynasty (559–330 bc), the Arsacid dynasty (247 bc–ad 224), the Sassanid Empire (225–640), the Islamic Caliphate (640–1502), the Safavid dynasty (1502–1736), the Afshar and Zand periods (1736–79), the Qajar dynasty (1779–1925), the Pahlavi dynasty (1925–79), and the present-day Islamic Republic. (For the history of Iran prior to 1502, see Persia.)\n\nThe Safavid Dynasty (1502–1736)\n\nThe Safavid dynasty marked the beginning of the Iranian state in an area that had approximately the same boundaries as present-day Iran. The Safavid rulers were the descendants of the famous Shiʿah saint Safi al-Din, and they exercised both religious and secular powers. Under Shah ʿAbbas I (ruled 1588–1629), Persia achieved a level of power and prosperity it never again experienced. ʿAbbas established Farsi as the universal language throughout Persia. He was also the first of the Safavids to enforce adherence to the Shiʿite branch of Islam; prior to his rule, the majority of the country had followed the Sunni Muslim sect. ʿAbbas moved the Persian capital from Kazvin to the centrally located Esfahan. He invested heavily in the beautification of Esfahan, commissioning lavish mosques and other structures. Under his rule, the city became a major center of commerce.\n\nThe Afshar and Zand Periods (1736–79)\n\nDuring Safavid rule, Persia had increased contact with Europe but faced escalating threats from the Ottomans in Turkey and the Mughals in Afghanistan. Beginning in 1722, Afghan invaders entered Persia from the east, occupying large regions. During the same period, the country faced threats of invasion by Turkey and Russia from the west. The Afghan occupation lasted until 1736, when the invaders were evicted by Nadir Shah, who assumed the throne and ruled until 1747. Nadir is considered Persia’s most gifted military leader and has often been referred to as the “Napoleon of Persia.” Under his rule, Persia reestablished its military strength. Nadir invaded Afghanistan in 1738, capturing Kabul and moving on to India, where he sacked Delhi. Upon leaving India, he took with him many Indian treasures, including the famous bejeweled Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-noor diamond. Unlike the Safavid rulers, however, Nadir had little interest in art; his great passion was war and the military. In addition to his battles with the Afghans and India, he founded the Persian navy, and he moved the capital to Mashhad, which was close to a military fortress he favored. In an attempt to align Persia more closely with Turkey, Nadir attempted to reconcile the Shiʿite and Sunni sects of Islam, but this failed. Toward the end of his reign, his continued oppression of the people of Persia inspired an increase in revolts. He was assassinated in 1747 by several of his own commanders. Nader was succeeded by Karim Khan Zand, one of his generals.\n\nZand was a compassionate ruler who refused to assume the title shahanshah (king of kings), preferring to be titled vakil (regent). His reign, from 1750 to 1779, was relatively peaceful, allowing the country to recuperate from nearly a half century of war. Zand moved the capital to Shiraz and promoted the construction of fine buildings. His understanding of economics helped to reorganize the fiscal structure of the country. Like some of his predecessors, Zand encouraged the development of trade relations with the countries of Europe, permitting an English trading company to establish itself at a trading post on the Persian Gulf. Following Zand’s death in 1779, internal dissension led to power struggles for the throne. The leader of the Turkmen Qajar tribe, Agha Mohammad Khan, assumed the leadership of Iran in 1779; though challenged by many rivals, he led the battle to unify the country.\n\nThe Qajar Dynasty (1779–1925)\n\nThe Qajar dynasty brought the start of a new, modern era. After establishing himself as ruler in 1779, Agha Mohammad Khan moved the seat of government from Shiraz back to Tehran, which became the permanent capital in 1788. By 1794 Khan had eliminated all of his rivals for the throne and had reestablished Iranian authority over portions of the neighboring Caucasus region. He was formally crowned as shah, or king, in 1796 but was assassinated the following year. His successor was his nephew Fath ʿAli Shah, who reigned from 1797 until 1834. Unlike his uncle, Fath ʿAli was unable to maintain control over the newly acquired territories in the Caucasus. His armies suffered disastrous defeats in two wars with Russia (1804–13 and 1826–28), after which Russia regained control of Georgia, Armenia, and northern Azerbaijan. The 1828 Treaty of Turmanchay established what is now Iran’s northern border. The rulers were also confronted by pressure from Great Britain, which was vying with Russia for influence in Iran. Britain gained control of the ports on the Persian Gulf in order to assure its control of the sea routes to India, its chief colony.\n\nIn 1834 Fath ʿAli was succeeded by his grandson Mohammad. The latter reigned until his death in 1848, when the throne passed to his son Naser al-Din Shah. Naser’s reign, which extended from 1848 to 1896, proved to be one of the most notable among the Qajars. He promoted the introduction of Western science, technology, and education into Iran, helping to bring Iran into the modern era. The by-product of this was increased Western influence on domestic affairs, a situation that eventually proved disastrous.\n\nModernization began in Iran with the establishment of telegraph lines, along with administrative and military reforms. These steps were taken with the help of foreign advisers and were financed by loans from Russia and Britain. Increasingly, however, the people resented the process of Westernization and the influx of foreigners. They also objected to Iran’s growing indebtedness to European powers and the increased intervention by Great Britain and Russia in Persian internal affairs. Iran granted numerous concessions to foreign-owned businesses. In 1872 the British Baron de Reuter was given a monopoly for 70 years for all railways, irrigation enterprises, and all mined products other than gold, silver, and precious stones.\n\nThe first real demonstration of popular discontent with foreign influences came in 1890, when Naser al-Din granted a monopoly to a British subject for the production, sale, and export of tobacco. The people revolted, boycotting tobacco and threatening strikes and riots. Although Naser al-Din canceled the monopoly, popular discontent lingered, seeding widespread conspiracies that led to Naser’s assassination in 1896. In 1901 the people again engaged in widespread protest, this time against loans from Russia that had been used to pay for then-shah Mozaffar al-Din’s trips to Europe.\n\nThe escalating civil unrest served as a prelude to the Persian Revolution of 1906, during which about 16,000 people took refuge in mosques while protests raged. Modern government was finally introduced when Mozaffar al-Din Shah (ruled 1896–1907) agreed to give the country a constitution and a legislature. The constitution of 1906 was supplemented in 1907 and amended in 1925, 1949, 1957, and 1967. Among other statutes, it provided for the first elected parliament (legislature), which was called the Majles.\n\nMozaffar died soon after signing the new constitution into law, and he was succeeded by his son, Mohammad ʿAli. The latter was opposed to constitutional rule and engaged Russia to help him overthrow the newly formed legislature and other branches of the constitutional government. This led to two short-lived civil wars, after which ʿAli was forced to abdicate his throne. The rule of Persia passed to his son, Ahmad Shah, the last of the Qajar shahs, who governed until the dawn of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925.\n\nIn 1907 the Russians and the British had divided Iran into spheres of influence, with Russia controlling the north and Britain the southeast. During World War I, Iran declared itself officially neutral but actually supported Germany and its allies. Iran quickly turned into a battlefield between British, German, Russian, and Turkish forces. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Russia withdrew its troops from Iran. The British then hoped to establish a controlling influence over the whole country, but the Iranian parliament rejected their offer of financial and military assistance.\n\nThe Pahlavi Dynasty (1925–79)\n\nThe Pahlavi Dynasty was founded by Reza Khan, a man of humble origin who had gained control over the elite Cossack Brigade and used it to unify the country under his command. He became minister of war and commander of the army after a coup d’état in 1921, and in October 1923 he seized the seat of prime minister. Ahmad Shah, the last of the Qajar rulers, left the country a few months later, and Reza Khan was proclaimed shah in 1925. He adopted the name of Pahlavi.\n\nReza Shah Pahlavi was a reformer who wanted to modernize his country. He established Western-style schools, including the University of Tehran, and freed women from their obligation to wear a veil. He also built the country’s first railroad, from northern Iran to the head of the Persian Gulf. He financed the project with revenues from taxes that were levied on the consumption of tea and sugar. Along the way, he equalized Persia’s relationship with other countries. Amid the increasingly nationalistic climate of the mid-1930s, Reza Shah proclaimed in 1935 that Persia would henceforth be called by its ancient name, Iran.\n\nReza Shah’s government adopted Western legal codes, modeled after the French system of law. During the 1920s commercial, criminal, and civil codes were established. The constitution provided that no laws could conflict with the Shariʿah, the religious law based on Islam. In addition, a council of five members of the highest clergy was to be set up to determine constitutionality of legislation. However, Reza Shah and his son, Mohammad Reza, who would succeed him as shah in 1941, never permitted the council to operate. Because of this and other factors, Iranian religious leaders were hostile toward both Pahlavi shahs.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Reza Shah favored the German side. As a result, the Soviet Union and Great Britain began occupying Iran in 1941 to obstruct German operations there and to maintain a link for shipping American supplies to the Soviet Union. Reza Shah was soon forced to abdicate in favor of Mohammad Reza, and the power of the Iranian government was limited to domestic affairs that did not interfere with the interests of the occupation powers. Nevertheless, modern political parties emerged, including the communist Tudeh Party. When the Allies left Iran after the war, the Soviet-influenced Azerbaijan Republic and Kurdish Republic were established. However, these two independent republics could not maintain themselves without Soviet support, and they soon collapsed.\n\nThe postwar struggle to restore Iran’s autonomy hampered Mohammad Reza Shah’s efforts to assert his power. The Majles tried to force him into the position of a constitutional monarch. The shah’s position was also threatened by a challenge from Mohammad Mosaddeq, who became prime minister in 1951. Mosaddeq led a group called the National Front, which wanted to reduce the powers of the monarchy and the clergy in Iran and to regain control of Iran’s natural resources. Mosaddeq immediately nationalized Iran’s oil industry, forcing the British Oil Company to withdraw. The resulting political conflict between Mosaddeq and the shah led to the latter’s departure from Iran in 1953. With covert support from the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, however, the Iranian army returned him to power within a few days, and Mosaddeq was arrested.\n\nAfter Mohammad Reza’s reinstatement, his government became increasingly totalitarian. The shah outlawed all political parties and set up a one-party government loyal to him. To win support from the masses of impoverished peasants and to undermine the power of the large landowners and the clergy, the shah proclaimed a White Revolution. This program, which was endorsed by the voters in 1963, called for land reform, nationalization of the forests, public sale of state-owned industries, and profit sharing for industrial workers. It also called for the right to vote for all citizens and the formation of literacy, health, and agricultural extension corps. Among the program’s other provisions were the establishment of local courts, nationalization of water resources, urban and rural reconstruction, and modernization of the government.\n\nThe White Revolution broke the powers of the large landholders and led to the distribution of land to many people who had never owned any before. In October 1967 a spectacular coronation ceremony for the shah and the queen took place in Persepolis, the ancient capital of Cyrus the Great. Guests from throughout the world were invited to the ceremony, which was held to emphasize the stability of the shah’s regime.\n\nIn 1973, with a sudden increase of income from the sale of oil, the government began an extensive building program. Skyscrapers rose in Tehran, and urban development proceeded rapidly. The country’s newly attained wealth was unevenly distributed, however, and the high-paying jobs went to members of the educated upper classes. There were great differences between the standards of living of the urban and rural populations. Inflation brought greater hardships to the rural areas, and the cultural gap widened between the Westernized elite and the peasants. More than 60 percent of the people remained illiterate. Many of the seminomadic tribes continued to live as their ancestors had hundreds of years before.\n\nAs resentment arose against the government’s failure to guarantee civil and political rights, the shah’s secret police kept a close watch on political dissidents. Iran’s religious leaders, together with their rural supporters, resented measures that they considered hostile to Islam. For example, the shah stopped using the Islamic calendar and deprived the clergy of land that had been under its control in the form of religious foundations. The shah also spent billions on modernizing the armed forces and brought in thousands of foreigners, including Americans, to train his soldiers and to help build a modern state.\n\nBy 1977 discontent with the shah’s policies had led to widespread demonstrations. Many people were killed, and Mohammad Reza imposed martial law in 1978. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a cleric who had been expelled from Iran in 1964 after he led the opposition to the White Revolution, called for the shah to step down. Finally, on January 16, 1979, the shah left the country.\n\nIslamic Republic\n\nA council led by a longtime opponent of the shah took control of the government, but the protests continued. Shortly after the shah’s departure, the ayatollah returned to Iran. During his exile, tapes of his sermons had been smuggled into Iran from Iraq and later from France; they were heard by shortwave radio in mosques throughout Iran. Khomeini’s reputation was so great that he was able to take control of the government, ruling through a group called the Revolutionary Council. After receiving overwhelming support in a national referendum, Khomeini proclaimed Iran an Islamic republic on April 1, 1979.\n\nReligious leaders immediately took steps to exclude their former left-wing, nationalist, and intellectual allies from positions of power in the new government, and they enforced a return to conservative social values. A religious militia group called the Revolutionary Guards was formed to defend the government against its opponents. Hundreds of Iranians were executed for political or religious reasons. A new constitution adopted in October 1979 created a religious government and established the role of a supreme leader with sweeping powers. The constitution named Islam as the official religion of Iran but allowed for several official religious minorities.\n\nThe government and the militia made every effort to suppress Western cultural influence in Iran. This anti-Western sentiment eventually led to the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants on November 4, 1979, shortly after the shah was admitted into the United States for medical treatment. The militants held 66 Americans as hostages. They released 13 of the hostages two weeks later and said they would free the remaining captives if the United States returned the shah to Iran for trial. The United States refused the demand and imposed economic sanctions.\n\nThe United States met failure in its attempt to rescue the hostages in April 1980. In July of that year, Mohammad Reza Shah died while in exile in Egypt. The revolutionaries finally freed the hostages in January 1981 after the United States agreed to a number of economic and other concessions.\n\nIn September 1980 Iraq canceled a 1975 treaty with Iran that had given both countries navigation rights through the Shatt al ʿArab river, which flows into the Persian Gulf. In the ensuing war both Iran and Iraq suffered casualties numbering more than one million. Major cities were bombed with missiles and chemical weapons. Oil facilities and power stations sustained severe damage. A cease-fire was declared in August 1988.\n\nSoon after ousting his designated successor Ayatollah Ali Montazeri and other moderates, Ayatollah Khomeini died on June 3, 1989. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was elected interim president, but in July Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected president and Khamenei was appointed supreme leader. During the Gulf crisis and Persian Gulf War of 1990–91, Iran opposed Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait but also opposed intervention by outside forces. An attempt at playing peacemaker failed; thereafter Iran kept out of the conflict. In the early 1990s Iran became involved in the civil war in Lebanon. It used its influence there to help secure the release of Westerners held hostage by Lebanese extremists. This development helped warm relations with some Western governments.\n\nAfter years of very conservative government, in 1997 Iranian voters elected Mohammed Khatami, a cleric with moderate positions on social issues, as president. Among Khatami’s appointees was Massoumeh Ebtekar, the first woman to hold a cabinet position in Iran since the Islamic revolution of 1979. In 2001 Khatami was elected to a second term as president.\n\nIran’s leaders condemned the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and supported the resulting U.S. military campaign against the Taliban government of Afghanistan. Nevertheless, in his 2002 State of the Union address, U.S. President George W. Bush portrayed Iran as a member of an “axis of evil” that also included Iraq and North Korea. Bush said that Iran was a supporter of terrorism and was working to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s leaders denounced Bush’s characterization, and relations between the two countries again deteriorated.\n\nAmid allegations of election rigging, parliamentary elections took place in Iran in 2004 and restored the conservatives to power. In the presidential election held the following year, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the hard-line mayor of Tehran, defeated Rafsanjani. During Ahmadinejad’s tenure, foreign policy remained antagonistic to the West, particularly with regard to Iran’s nuclear activities.\n\nDespite Iran’s insistence that its nuclear program was intended for peaceful purposes, the international community advocated efforts to suspend it. The United Nations (UN) Security Council passed a series of sanctions that failed to deter Iran from continuing its nuclear activities. Tensions were raised further by Iran’s highly publicized tests of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles. In 2009 it was revealed that Iran was secretly constructing a heavily fortified underground facility for the enrichment of uranium (an element used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons). These developments were followed by a new round of UN sanctions against Iran. The United States and the European Union also imposed sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and natural gas industries.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of the Iranian presidential election of 2009 were disputed. Government officials declared that Ahmadinejad had won the election outright by a large margin. However, one of his moderate challengers, former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, alleged electoral fraud. Mousavi supporters held massive demonstrations—some of them violent—in the capital and elsewhere. A partial recount of the votes confirmed that 50 constituencies had returned more votes than there were registered voters. Although these irregularities could have affected some three million votes, the Council of Guardians indicated that this would not change the outcome of the election. Ahmadinejad was sworn in for a second term, and periodic demonstrations persisted in the months that followed. Antigovernment protests again broke out in 2011 following the Arab Spring uprisings that brought down the governments of Tunisia and Egypt. The Iranian police and militia forces cracked down, firing tear gas into the crowds and attacking demonstrators.\n\nIn 2013 Hassan Rouhani was elected to succeed Ahmadinejad as president of Iran. Rouhani was a veteran politician and cleric who was generally regarded as a moderate conservative. His commanding victory was seen as a rejection of the hard-line faction represented by Ahmadinejad. Many voters considered Ahmadinejad responsible for Iran’s growing international isolation and struggling economy.\n\nThe election of Rouhani brought about a shift in Iran’s handling of the nuclear issue. Rouhani had campaigned on a promise to restart international negotiations with the goal of reducing sanctions on Iran. Upon taking office, he worked toward improving Iran’s relations with the West. In a speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2013, Rouhani emphasized his country’s willingness to seek compromise over its nuclear program. Later that month he had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama, the first direct dialogue between a U.S. and an Iranian leader since 1979.\n\nIn November 2013 Iran entered into talks with a group comprising the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By the end of the month an interim agreement had been reached that placed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for a temporary reduction in sanctions. A final agreement signed in July 2015 required Iran to reduce its nuclear stockpile and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities in exchange for the reduction of sanctions. In January 2016 international economic sanctions on Iran were lifted after the UN said that it was satisfied with Iran’s progress in implementing the agreement.\n\nRouhani won a second term as president by a landslide in May 2017. The election results were largely interpreted as a referendum on the nuclear agreement. Rouhani benefited from the enthusiastic support of young Iranians eager for greater economic opportunity and more international engagement.\n\nIn June 2017, just weeks after the election, about a dozen people were killed and many more were wounded in a pair of terrorist attacks in Tehran. Terrorists armed with rifles and bombs attacked Iran’s Parliament and the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe nuclear agreement faltered in May 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it. Trump criticized aspects of the agreement that he believed were insufficient and announced that the United States would resume economic sanctions on Iran. The U.S. sanctions included penalties for countries that continued to trade with Iran. This provision hindered efforts by European countries to hold up their end of the deal. The sanctions went into effect in November 2018. The United States granted exemptions to several countries to continue importing oil from Iran, but those exemptions expired in May 2019.\n\nThe renewed sanctions had a devastating effect on Iran’s economy. Rouhani responded to the sanctions by announcing that Iran would begin pulling back on its commitments under the nuclear agreement. Iran resumed storing surplus enriched uranium and began enriching uranium at higher levels. He said these measures would be reversed if European countries honored their end of the agreement.\n\nRouhani was prevented by term limits from running for reelection again. The end of his presidency in 2021 marked a turning point in Iran toward more conservative leadership. The Council of the Guardians, which oversees elections, did not allow many candidates to run for office in 2021. The conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi was the only high-profile candidate who was approved. For this reason, he won in a landslide. (Raisi later died in office, in a helicopter crash in 2024). Meanwhile, the great majority of the seats in the parliament were filled by conservatives as well. The Council of the Guardians had disqualified most of the non-conservative candidates in the parliamentary elections of 2020, including many who were running for reelection. It disqualified 7,000 candidates in all, allowing the conservatives to sweep the elections."
