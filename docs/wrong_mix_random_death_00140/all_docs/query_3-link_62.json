In particular,\n\nOF AC is adding to the ITSR general\n\nlicenses authorizing the importation\n\ninto the United States of, and dealings\n\nin, certain Iranian-origin foodstuffs and\n\ncarpets and related transactions to\n\nimplement the USG commitment set out\n\nin section 5.1.3 of Annex II and section\n\n17.5 of Annex V of the JCPOA. In\n\naddition , to reflect the USG's\n\nimplementation of ils commitment set\n\nout in section 4 of Annex II and section\n\n17.4 of Annex V of the JCPOA to\n\nterminate Executive Order 13622 of July\n\n30, 2012, OFAC is removing regulatory\n\nprovisions that implemented the\n\nblocking sanctions in sections 5 and 6\n\nof Executive Order 13622. OFAC is also\n\nmaking certain technical and\n\nconforming changes to its regulations to\n\nreflect the implementation of the USG\n\ncommitment set out in section 4.8.1 of\n\nAnnex II and section 17.3 of Annex V\n\nof the JCPOA to remove the individuals\n\nand entities set forth in Attachment 3 to\n\nAnnex II of the JCPOA from OFAC's\n\nSpecially Designated Nationals and\n\nBlocked Persans List, the Foreign\n\nSanctions Evaders List, and/or the NonSDN\n\nIran Sanctions Act List, as\n\nappropriate, on Implementation Day of\n\nthe JCPOA.\n\nDATES: Effective: January 21, 2016\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The\n\nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of\n\nForeign Assets Contrai: Assistant\n\nDirector for Licensing, tel. : 202- 622-\n\n2480, Assistant Director for Regulatory\n\nAffairs, tel.: 202- 622-4855, Assistant\n\nDirector for Sanctions Compliance &\n\nEvaluation, tel.: 202- 622- 2490; or the\n\nDepartment of the Treasury's Office of\n\nthe Chief Counsel (Foreign Assets\n\nContrai), Office of the General Counsel,\n\ntel.: 202-622-2410.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nElectronic and Facsimile Availability\n\nThis document and additional\n\ninformation concerning OF AC are\n\navailable from OFAC's Web site\n\n(www.treaswy.gov/ofac).

The\n\nJCPOA pravides that the United States\n\nGovernment (USG) will undertake the\n\nsanctions-related commitments\n\ndescribed in sections 17.1 to 17.4 of\n\nAnnex V of the JCPOA once the\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\n\n(IAEA) has verified that Iran has\n\nimplemented key nuclear-related\n\ncommitments described in the JCPOA.\n\nThe date for this sanctions lifting is\n\nreferred to as \"Implementation Day\" in\n\nthe JCPOA. In addition, the JCPOA\n\nprovides that, on Implementation Day,\n\nthe USG will license certain activities\n\ninvolving Iran as described in section 5\n\nof Annex II and section 17 .5 of Annex\n\nV of the JCPOA. OFAC is now amen ding\n\nthe Iranian Transactions and Sanctions\n\nRegulations, 31 CFR part 560 (ITSR), to\n\nimplement the USG's commitment\n\npursuant to the JCPOA to license the\n\nimportation into the United States of\n\nIranian-origin carpets and foodstuffs,\n\nincluding pistachios and caviar, and to\n\nmake certain technical and conforming\n\nchanges to reflect the implementation of\n\nother USG JCPOA commitments on\n\nImplementation Day, as set forth below.\n\nImportation of Certain Foodstuffs and\n\nCarpets\n\nTo implement the USG commitment\n\nset out in section 5.1.3 of Annex II and\n\nsection 17.5 of Annex V of the JCPOA\n\nto license the importation into the\n\nUnited States of Iranian-origin carpets\n\nand foodstuffs, including pistachios and\n\ncaviar, OFAC is adding § 560.534 to the\n\nITSR to authorize by general l icense the\n\nimportation into the United States of,\n\nand dealings in, certain Iranian-origin\n\nfoodstuffs and carpets from Iran or a\n\nthird country. OFAC's publication of\n\nthis general license as an amendment to\n\nthe ITSR fulfills the requirements of\n\nsection 103(d)(2)(A) of the\n\nComprehensive Iran Sanctions,\n\nAccountability, and Divestment Act of\n\n2010, as amended, [Pub. L. 111-195) (22\n\nU.S.C. 8501- 8551) [CISADA). In\n\naddition, to fulfill the requirements of\n\nsection 103(d)(2)(B) of CISADA, the\n\nSecretary of State is submitting to the\n\napprapriate congressional committees a\n\ncertification in writing that it is in the\n\nnational interest of the United States to\n\nprovide an excep tion to the prohibition\n\non the importation of Iranian-origin\n\ngoods to the extent required to\n\nimplement the sanctions commitment\n\ndescribed in section 5.1.3 of Annex II of\n\nthe JCPOA and a report describi ng the\n\nreasons for this exception.\n\nSection 560.534[a) authorizes the\n\nimportation into the United States of\n\nlranian-origin foodstuffs intended for\n\nhuman consumption that are classified\n\nunder chapters 2- 23 of the Harmonized\n\nTariff Schedule of the United States\n\n(HTSJ. Items that are classified in\n\nchapters 2- 23 of the HTS that are not\n\nfoodstuffs intended for human\n\nconsumption are not authorized for\n\nimportation into the United States by\n\nthis section. This section also authorizes\n\nthe importation into the United States of\n\nIranian-origin carpets and other textile\n\nfloor coverings and carpets used as wall\n\nhangings that are classified under\n\nchapter 5 7 or heading 9706.00.0060 of\n\nthe HTS. Items that are classified under\n\nheading 9706.00.0060 (\"Antiques of an\n\nage exceeding one hundred years/\n\nOther\") that are not carpets and other\n\ntextile wall coverings or carpets used as\n\nwall hangings are not authorized for\n\nimportation into the United States by\n\nthis section.\n\nSection 560.534[b) authorizes U.S.\n\npersans, wherever located, to engage in\n\ntransactions or dealings in or related ta\n\nsuch Iranian-origin foodstuffs and\n\ncarpets, provided that such transactions\n\nor dealings do not involve or relate to\n\ngoods, technology, or services for\n\nexportation, reexportation, sale, or\n\nsupply, directly or indirectly, to Iran,\n\nthe Government of Iran, an Iranian\n\nfinancial institution, or any other persan\n\nwhose property and interests in\n\npraperty are blocked pursuant to\n\n§ 560.211 of the ITSR, other than\n\nservices described in § 560.405\n\n(\"Transactions ordinarily incident to a\n\nlicensed transaction authorized\") and\n\ntransfers of funds described in § 560.516\n\n(\"Transfers of funds involving Iran\").\n\nSection 560.534(c) clarifies that\n\n§ 560.534(a)- (b) does not authorize the\n\nimportation into the United States of\n\ngoods that are un der seizure or\n\ndetention by the Department of\n\nHomeland Security, or of goods for\n\nwhich forfeiture proceedings have\n\ncommenced or of goods that have been\n\nforfeited to the U.S. Government.\n\n- 20 -\n\nFerlerai Register /Vol. 81, No. 13/Thursday, January 21, 2016/Rules and Regulations 3331\n\nSection 560.534(d) clarifies that nothing\n\nin § 560.534 authorizes the debiting or\n\ncrediting of Iranian accounts, as defined\n\nin § 560.320.\n\nTransactions ordinarily incident to\n\nthe transactions authorized in § 560.534\n\nand necessary to gi ve effect thereto also\n\nare authorized as set forth in § 560.405.\n\nOFAC is amending § 560.405 by\n\ninserting new paragraph (ll, which\n\nclarifies that the scope of authorized\n\nincidental transactions does not include\n\nletter of credit services relating to\n\ntransactions authorized in§ 560.534.\n\nThose letter of credit services that are\n\nauthorized are set forth separately in\n\nparagraphs (a) and (b) of§ 560.535,\n\nwhich OF AC is also adding to the ITSR.\n\nPlease see §§ 560.405(b) and 560.516\n\nregarding transfers of funds in\n\nconnection with licensed activities.\n\nBrokering services relating to\n\ntransactions authorized by this final rule\n\nalso are authorized. See § 560.535(c).\n\nExecutive Order 13622\n\nOn July 30, 2012, the President,\n\ninvoking the authority of, inter alia, the\n\nInternational Emergency Economie\n\nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)\n\n(IEEPA), issued Executive Ortler (E.O.)\n\n13622. Section 5 of E.O. 13622 blocked\n\n\"ail property and interests in property\n\nthat are in the United States, that\n\nh ereafter came within the United States,\n\nor that are or hereafter corne within the\n\npossession or contrai of\" any U.S.\n\npersan, including any foreign branch, of\n\nany persan determined by the Secretary\n\nof the Treasury, in consultation with the\n\nSecretary of State, to have materially\n\nassisted, sponsored, or provided\n\nfinancial, material, or technological\n\nsupport for, or goods or services in\n\nsupport of, the National Iranian Oil\n\nCompany (NIOC), the Naftiran\n\nIntertrade Company (NICO), or the\n\nCentral Bank of Iran, or the purchase or\n\nacquisition of U.S. bank notes or\n\nprecious metals by the Government of\n\nIran. Section 6 of E.O. 13622 provided\n\nthat subsection 5(a) of E.O. 13622,\n\namong other specified provisions, shall\n\nnot apply with respect to any persan for\n\nconducting or facilitating a transaction\n\ninvolving a natural gas development\n\nand pipeline project initiated prior to\n\nJuly 31, 2012, to bring gas from\n\nAzerbaijan to Europe and Turkey in\n\nfurtherance of a production sharing\n\nagreement or license awarded by a\n\nsovereign government other than the\n\nGovernment oflran. On December 26,\n\n2012, OFAC published a final rule in\n\nthe Federal Register (77 FR 75845) that,\n\ninter alia, implemented sections 5 and\n\n6 of E.O. 13622 by amending § 560.211\n\nof the ITSR to add paragraph (c)(2) and\n\na corresponding note.\n\nPursuant to ils Implementation Day\n\ncommitment set out in section 4 of\n\nAnnex II and section 17.4 of Annex V\n\nof the JCPOA, the United States\n\nGovernment has revoked E.O. 13622.\n\nAccordingly, OFAC is amending\n\n§ 560.211 of the ITSR by removing\n\nparagraph (c)(2) and the Note ta\n\nparagraph (c)(2), which implemented\n\nsections 5 and 6 of E.O. 13622,\n\nrespecti vel y.\n\nTeclrnical and Conforming Changes\n\nOFAC is also making certain technical\n\nand conforming changes to 31 CFR\n\nchapter V to reflect the implementation\n\nof the USG commitment set out in\n\nsection 4.8.1 of Annex II and section\n\n17.3 of Annex V of the JCPOA. Pursuant\n\nto that commitment, on Implementation\n\nDay, OFAC is removing individuals and\n\nentities identified in Attachment 3 to\n\nAnnex II of the JCPOA from the\n\nSpecially Designated Nationals and\n\nBlocked Persans List (SDN List), the\n\nForeign Sanctions Evaders List, and/or\n\nthe Non-SDN Iran Sanctions Act List, as\n\nappropriate. The individuals and\n\nentities being removed from the SDN\n\nList include persans that OF AC has\n\npreviously identified as blocked\n\npursuant to E.O. 13599 of February 5,\n\n2012 (\"Blocking Property of the\n\nGovernment Iran and lranian Financial\n\nInstitutions\") because they meet the\n\ndefinition of the terms \"Government of\n\nIran\" or \"Iranian financial institution.\"\n\nThese individuals and entities are\n\nmarked with an asterisk in Attachment\n\n3 to Annex II of the JCPOA. Non-U.S.\n\npersans will no longer be subject to\n\nsecondary sanctions, including under\n\nrelevant provisions of the Iran Freedom\n\nand Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012\n\nand other applicable authorities, for\n\nengaging in transactions or activities\n\nwith these individuals and entities,\n\nprovided that the transactions do not\n\ninclude conduct that remains\n\nsanctionable or individuals or entities\n\nthat remain on the SDN List. However,\n\nthese individuals and entities being\n\nremoved from the SDN List remain\n\npersans whose property and interests in\n\nproperty that are in the U.S., or that are\n\nor came within the possession or\n\ncontrai of any U.S. persan, are blocked\n\npursuant to E.O. 13599. While OFAC is\n\nremoving these persans from the SDN\n\nList on Implementation Day, they will\n\nnow be included on a \"List of Persans\n\nIdentified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to\n\nExecutive Ortler 13599\" (E.O. 13599\n\nList), which OF AC is making available\n\non ils Web site: www.treasury.gov/\n\nresource-center!sanctions/Programs/\n\nPages/13599_/ist.aspx. To reflect these\n\nchanges, OFAC is revising notes in\n\n§§ 560.211 and 560.304 of the ITSR,\n\nadding a new note to § 560.324 of the\n\nITSR, and revising a note to appendix A\n\nto 31 CFR chapter V.\n\nPublic Participation\n\nBecause the amendment of the ITSR\n\ninvolves a foreign affairs function, the\n\nprovisions of Executive Ortler 12866\n\nand the Administrative Procedure Act (5\n\nU.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed\n\nrulemaking, opportunity for public\n\nparticipation, and delay in effective date\n\nare inapplicable. Because no notice of\n\nproposed rulemaking is required for this\n\nrule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5\n\nU.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act\n\nThe collections of information related\n\nto the ITSR are contained in 31 CFR part\n\n501 (the \"Reporting, Procedures and\n\nPenalties Regulations\").
