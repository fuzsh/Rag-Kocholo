        "text": "Extant studies of Iranian nationalism accentuate the self-aggrandizing side of Iranian modernity, mainly achieved through, and informing, a process of otherizing certain non-Persians/Iranians, particularly the Arabs. I argue that equally important to understanding Iranian modernity is its lesser recognized, shameful and self-demeaning face, as manifested through a simultaneous 19th-century discourse, which I call “self-deprecating modernity.” This was an often self-ridiculing and shame-inducing, sometimes satirical, discourse featuring an emotion-driven and self-Orientalizing framework that developed out of many mid-nineteenth-century Iranian modernists’ obsessions with Europe's gaze; with self-surveillance; and with the perceived humiliation of Iranians through the ridiculing laughter of Other (especially European) nations at Iran's and Iranians’ expense. To explore this discourse, I re-examine the works of three pre-constitutionalist thinkers and writers within the broader sociopolitical context of late Qajar Iran, surveying their perspectives on shame, embarrassment, and ridiculing laughter, and showing how they were significantly informed by, while also helping to form, self-deprecating modernity. Given the strong, self-colonizing presumptions of this discourse, I conclude the article with a stress on the importance of re-exploring collective self-critical practices in modern Iranian history, culture, and literature with an eye toward decolonizing self-criticism.\n\n12 See Kashani-Sabet, Firoozeh, “Fragile Frontiers: The Diminishing Domains of Qajar Iran,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 29, no. 2 (1997): 211–13CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Mohammad Taheri Khosruvshahi, Fasl-ha-yi Tariki: Jang-ha-yi Rus ba Iran dar Shiʿr-i Farsi (Tehran: Tamaddun-i Irani, 2009). “During the past two centuries,” Khosruvshahi remarks, “the bitter memory of losing parts of Iran Zamin [Iran-Land] has created some shared regret and despair in the collective consciousness of the Iranian nation” (11). In the preface to Khosruvshahi's book, Jamshid Alizadeh writes, “This book concerns one of the ghastliest tragedies in the history of our oppressed homeland, that is, Tsarist Russia's assault on Iran and the subsequent severing of seventeen Caucasian towns from the body of our motherland. This calamity contains such broad dimensions that even after two centuries its memory still distresses true Iranians’ hearts and causes them to shed sorrowful tears” (13). In Persian language historiographies, the Gulistan and Turkamanchay treaties are often described using the adjective shameful or disgraceful (nangīn).\n\n19 Ibid., 1175. The low self-esteem of Iranians vis-à-vis Europe also was manifested more symbolically. For instance, the prolific mid-to-late Qajar-era author Muhammad Hasan Khan Iʿtimad al-Saltana, despite his linguistic purification program that entailed replacing Arabic and Turkish words with Persian ones, insisted on using European words: “He considered it a sign of erudition, not a mark of mediocrity, to lace his narrative with French or English expressions” (Kashani-Sabet, “Fragile Frontiers,” 224). On purifying Persian of “alien” languages, especially Arabic, during the above era, see also Gheissari, Iranian Intellectuals, 23–24.\n\n23 Mirza Fattah Khan Garmrudi, Safarnamih (Tehran: Bank-i Bazargani, 1968), 962. The quote above is Garmrudi's paraphrase of Fraser. Garmrudi does not cite his particular source. However, most of the numerous lengthy books of fiction and travel that Fraser wrote had a Persian background, and it is known that Fraser “strongly criticize[d] the character of the Persians, blaming it on their despotic and ‘hated’ Qajar rulers” (Denis Wright, “Fraser, James Baillie,” Encyclopaedia Iranica, accessed 21 February 2021, https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fraser-.) An amrad is a young male adolescent who is an object of desire of adult men.\n\n27 Ibid. For more instances of self-deprecating modernity in Siahatnamih-yi Ibrahim Biyg, see 237, 238, and 239. For similar humiliating comparisons between Iran and Europe by Iranian travelogue writers, see Tavakoli-Targhi, Refashioning Iran. For an account of the vital role of land and geography in the shaping of the modern concept of homeland (vaṭan) as well as the ongoing process of nation formation and Iranian self-definition during the Qajar era, see Firoozeh Kashani-Sabet, Frontier Fictions: Shaping the Iranian Nation, 1804–1946 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2014).\n\n42 Pardis Minuchehr, “Homeland from Afar: The Iranian Diaspora and the Quest for Modernity (1908–1909); The Constitutional Movement within a Global Perspective” (PhD diss., Columbia University, 1998), 3. Prior to and during the constitutional years, numerous Iranian diasporic authors also collaborated with satirical journals outside Iran, for example in Turkey and the Caucasus. Moreover, Iran-based magazines were influenced by the regional papers. Both the contents and the illustrations of the Baku-based Mulla Nasriddin inspired Iranian writers and illustrators (Hamed Kazemzadeh, “The Role of the Caucasian Satirical Magazines in the Iranian Constitutional Era,” paper presented at the International Society for Humor Studies Conference, Montreal, 10–14 July 2017). For the influence of Western satirical magazines, especially German satirical writing and illustration, on Mulla Nasriddin, see Christiane Bulut, “Printing in the Peripheries,” in Press and Mass Communication in the Middle East, ed. Börte Sagaster, Theoharis Stavrides, and Birgitt Hoffmann (Bamberg, Germany: University of Bamberg Press, 2017), 337–66.\n\n44 Ibid., 438. Although Brummett focuses on the self-aggrandizing side of satire in Turkey, as manifested in Turkish nationalist and anti-colonial satire, some of the cartoons she uses as examples of the “imminent threat of European imperialism” simultaneously depict self-deprecating modernity. A clear example is Brummett's Figure 1, which portrays a cartoon titled “Ttirkiye, Fifty Years Later” (438–39).\n\n62 Malkum Khan, “Rafiq va Vazir,” in Majmuʿih Asar, 56; “Dastgah-i Divan,” in Majmuʿih Asar, 87, 92, 95; “Intizam-i Lashgar,” in Majmuʿih Asar, 105. For the comparative framework of satire and shame, see Ruben Quintero, “Introduction: Understanding Satire,” in A Companion to Satire, ed. Ruben Quintero (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2007); Stephen Pattison, Shame: Theory, Therapy, Theology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); Thomas J. Scheff, “Shame in Self and Society,” Symbolic Interaction 26, no. 2 (2003): 239–62; Gershen Kaufman, The Psychology of Shame: Theory and Treatment of Shame-Based Syndromes (New York: Springer, 2004). I acknowledge the uncertainty of humor in the examples of Malkum's work discussed below. This vagueness is compatible with Michael Billig's caveat for defining \"humor.\" According to him, humor had better not be defined based on its desired reception: “[H]umour cannot be defined purely as that which elicits the response of laughter. Humour might involve the attempt to produce laughter in its recipients but it must be recognizable as humour even if it fails in its end” (Michael Billig, Laughter and Ridicule: Towards a Social Critique of Humour [London: Sage, 2005], 179).\n\n111 Lasting for several decades, the misattribution of Tabrizi's comedies to Malkum clearly demonstrates, as Algar notes, “the extent of [Malkum's] renown as a skilled and versatile writer of sociocritical literature” (Mirza Malkum Khan, 277). However, it also indicates that Malkum was too well known for the satirical tone and idiom in his writings to arouse any doubts among the audiences of the comic plays of (who now we know to be) Tabrizi. See Parsinejad, Ruwshangaran-i Irani, 165–179.\n\n113 Following Mignolo and Walsh, I acknowledge that “the conceptualizations and actionings of decoloniality are . . . multiple, contextual, and relational; they are not only the purview of peoples who have lived the colonial difference but, more broadly, of all of us who struggle from and within modernity/coloniality's borders and cracks, to build a radically distinct world.” See Walter D. Mignolo and Catherine E. Walsh, On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018), 4–5.\n\n122 See Abedinifard, Mostafa, “Structural Functions of the Targeted Joke: Iranian Modernity and the Qazvini Man as Predatory Homosexual,” HUMOR: International Journal of Humor Research 29, no. 3 (2016): 337–57CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Abedinifard, Mostafa, “Persian ‘Rashti Jokes’: Modern Iran's Palimpsests of Gheyrat-Based Masculinity,” British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 46, no. 4 (2019): 564–82CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Rashti jokes comprise a Persian ethnic joke cycle in which the men and women of the northern Iranian city of Rasht are respectively labeled cuckolds and promiscuous women. Qazvini jokes are a contemporary series of Persian jokes that represent the male adults of the city of Qazvin as predatory homosexuals. Abedinifard's argument for the genesis and gendered functions of the Qazvini joke cycle fits the framework of self-deprecating modernity.\n\n123 In Turki jokes, the Iranian Turks (Azeris) are typecast as stupid, whereas in Arab man jokes, the (Iranian) Arab-speaking males are branded as having overly large genitals, fixated on sex, and sometimes as mentally challenged. On ethnic stereotyping in contemporary Iran, see Alam Saleh, Ethnic Identity and the State in Iran (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). On the Arab man and Turki jokes, see Palmis Seifikar, “Asses and Cuckolds: Regional Ethnic Jokes from Iran” (MA thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 2003); and Tomasz Gacek, “The Image of Arabs and the Arabic Language in Contemporary Persian Jokes,” Polish Journal of the Arts and Culture 8, no. 5 (2013): 39–60."
