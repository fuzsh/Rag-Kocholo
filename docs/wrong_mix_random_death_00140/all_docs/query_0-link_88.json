Iran unleashed a barrage of missiles and drones on Saturday night and early on Sunday, targeting Israel in retaliation for April 1’s suspected Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, which killed 13 people. . . .\n\nIran’s massive aerial attack marks the first direct strike by Iran on Israeli territory from Iranian soil. Iran called the attack Operation True Promise.\n\nThe attack began on Saturday about 20:00 GMT. It lasted about five hours, according to United States officials. During the attack, explosions were heard in cities across Israel, including Tel Aviv. The explosions were also heard in Jerusalem, and air raid sirens sounded in more than 720 locations as Israeli forces sought to shoot down the projectiles.\n\nIsrael’s chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said Iran’s attack involved more than 120 ballistic missiles, 170 drones and more than 30 cruise missiles, according to a report by The Associated Press news agency. The Israeli military also said the vast majority of the projectiles were intercepted outside the country’s borders with help from the US, the United Kingdom and France. Jordan also shot down some of the missiles aimed at Israel as they were flying through Jordanian airspace.\n\nIsrael’s military added that a “small number of hits were identified”. In a base in southern Israel, “minor damage occurred to the infrastructure”, it said. A seven-year-old girl was also severely injured by missile fragments while other patients sustained minor injuries and some were treated for anxiety. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday that the US also intercepted “dozens” of missiles and drones launched at Israel from Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\n. . .\n\nDuring the attack, Israel’s military ordered residents in the northern Israeli-occupied Golan Heights – near the Syrian and Lebanese borders – and in the southern cities of Nevatim, Dimona and Eilat to remain near bomb shelters.\n\nNevatim is the site of an Israeli airbase while Dimona has a nuclear reactor on its outskirts. Eilat is Israel’s Red Sea port, which has suffered a sharp decline in operations because of repeated attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on ships using the waterway.\n\nAl Jazeera, 14 April\n\nIranian air base reportedly attacked in ‘limited’ Israeli reprisal strike\n\nIran downplays apparent retaliation and Israel keeps mum in sign both sides are looking to climb back from brink of war following international pressure for restraint. Explosions were heard near the Iranian city of Isfahan early Friday as Israel reportedly launched a heavily anticipated reprisal strike for an Iranian attack on Israel days earlier, defying international pressure to stand down.\n\nThere was no official confirmation of a strike from Israeli authorities; state-run media in Iran reported only that air defenses were activated, downplaying claims of an attack on a military site in the city some 315 kilometers (196 miles) south of Tehran and describing the incident as business-as-usual. But unnamed Israeli and American officials told US news outlets that Israel had carried out a strike. And the New York Times said three Iranian sources confirmed that a military air base in Isfahan had been struck. The scope of the damage was not clear.\n\nThe apparently limited nature of the strike, reportedly carried out with drones rather than missiles or airstrikes, and the lack of official acknowledgment will likely give the regime in Iran the strategic deniability needed to wriggle out of its bellicose threats to attack Israel a second time, providing an early indication that both Israel and Iran may be seeking to step back from the brink of war. The attack had been widely expected, with Israel providing indications throughout the week that it would not let an unprecedented Iranian barrage of over 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones early Sunday pass without a response, leading to fears of spiraling tit-for-tat attacks giving way to all-out war.\n\nTimes of Israel, 19 April\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkey says it halts trade with Israel over Gaza aid access\n\nTurkey’s Ministry of Trade cites humanitarian crisis in Gaza for its decision to suspend imports and exports. Turkey has halted exports and imports to and from Israel, the Turkish Ministry of Trade says, citing the “worsening humanitarian tragedy” in Gaza. “Export and import transactions related to Israel have been stopped, covering all products,” the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n“Turkey will strictly and decisively implement these new measures until the Israeli Government allows an uninterrupted and sufficient flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.” The announcement came after Israel’s foreign minister said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was breaking agreements by blocking ports from handling Israeli imports and exports. “This is how a dictator behaves, disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen, and ignoring international trade agreements,” Israel Katz posted on X.\n\nAl Jazeera, 2 May\n\nQatar\n\nFrustrated Qatar prepares to kick Hamas out\n\nThe emirate has acted as a mediator between the West and the Palestinian militants but has concluded that it’s not worth the trouble. When Israel told the Qataris in 2017 that one of the Hamas leaders they were hosting was planning attacks, they promptly showed him the door. Later, Israel contacted Qatar again to pass a message to Saleh al-Arouri, the founding commander of Hamas’s military wing, who had by then decamped to Beirut, although Arouri would not take the call.\n\nQatari officials have pointed to that episode in arguments they have made to increasingly hostile American politicians since last October, when the militant group’s massacre of 1,139 Israelis set off the punishing seven-month war in Gaza. First, Qatar took in Hamas’s political leadership in 2012 with America and Israel’s blessing. Second, the US administration has privately encouraged officials to keep up their mediation role, because expelling Hamas — as some US politicians demanded — would sever a vital channel with the group. But Doha no longer cares. In recent weeks two western diplomats and officials familiar with the matter say the Qatari government has concluded that the thankless task of hosting and mediating with Hamas’s obstinate leaders is not worth the trouble.\n\nEarlier this year, Texas A&M University said it would close its campus in Doha, which Qatar criticised as a decision based on “disinformation”, while the Republican senator Ted Budd has introduced a bill threatening to end US recognition of Qatar as a non-Nato ally unless it expels the Hamas leaders. For a country that hosts the region’s largest American military base and invested heavily in shoring up its image when hosting the 2022 Fifa World Cup, the criticism has stung.\n\nSunday Times, 21 April\n\nGaza War\n\nHamas Actually Believed It Would Conquer Israel\n\nIn preparation, it divided the country into cantons. Tens of thousands of Gazans have fled to Egypt since the war broke out, many of them members of the elite who are able to pay the enormous costs. I met old friends in Cairo who were still astonished at the messianic insanity that seized Hamas’ leadership\n\nCAIRO – In Gaza, they’re known as the “new Jews.” They’re the rich merchants of the Gaza Strip who were the first to flee for their lives after October 7, managed to save themselves and their families, and are continuing to run their businesses safely by remote. While enjoying the good life in Cairo’s luxury hotels, they’re selling the Strip to the highest bidders. When a kilogram of sugar costs 70 shekels (almost $19) and a liter of gas 150 shekels, it’s only natural for the 1.5 million internal refugees in Gaza to add the profiteers to their list of enemies, after Israel and Hamas.\n\nHaaretz, 5 April\n\nHamas leaders actually thought they would defeat and conquer Israel on Oct 7th\n\nThis article from Haaretz, based on interviews with exiled Palestinians and a little-known Hamas conference from 2021, has compelling evidence that Hamas leaders were on a religious frenzy leading up to Oct 7th and actually thought they would: .\n\nTopple Israel, taking it over in its entirety.\n\nBanish, kill or forcefully convert Israeli Jews into islam.\n\nEnslave Jewish engineers and other professionals into serving them as reparations for Israeli existence.\n\nTake over all legal function and physical property of Israel, creating an Islamic State Of Palestine.\n\nOriginal report of conference from 2021, which was seen as Israeli propaganda or Hamas fantasy at the time: https://www.memri.org/reports/memri-archives-%E2%80%93-october-4-2021-hamas-sponsored-promise-hereafter-conference-phase-following\n\nAs my analysis goes, this is a very real of irrational belief and extreme inability to judge military strength creating an irrational policy impacting the world. Additionaly, not only is this the mindset of Hamas leadership, but most of this leadership remains alive, and that most Palestinians support its continued rule as per recent polling. Israel can do nothing except take over Gaza, completely reoccupying for 5-10 years while doing a post-WW2 style reeducation and deradicalization campaign. Otherwise another Oct 7th is very much on the horizon. There can be no reconciliation or peace or middle ground when these are the beliefs of the Hamas leadership.\n\nReddit, 7 April\n\nHamas organized confab in 2021 to plot administration of ‘liberated Palestine’\n\nTerror group aimed to bring back Palestinian refugees, kill Israeli fighters, use educated Jews for their expertise, and be recognized as Israel’s successor at UN. Two years before its October 7 assault on southern Israel, Hamas drafted a “strategic vision” for the governing of “liberated Palestine” after the supposed inevitable demise of the State of Israel. At a conference held in Gaza in September 2021, Hamas and other Palestinian factions discussed preparations for the future administration of the State of Palestine, intended to make up the whole territory “from the river to the sea,” including the area of the State of Israel.\n\nThe conclusions reached at the conference, titled “Promise of the Hereafter – Post-Liberation Palestine,” were publicized by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) in an October 2021 report. The confab was reportedly funded by Hamas and sponsored by Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Today, it is apparent that the conference was not merely a rhetorical exercise, but the expression of a clear intent by Gazan terror factions to destroy Israel, the stated goal of their October 7 onslaught, when some 1,200 were brutally massacred and 253 abducted to Gaza.\n\nTimes of Israel, 22 April\n\nBinyamin Netanyahu condemns US move to sanction Israeli troops\n\nThe measures against the Netzah Yehuda battalion, accused of human rights abuses, would make them ineligible for military aid or training. The United States is poised to pass sanctions against an Israeli military battalion accused of human rights abuses in the West Bank, an unprecedented move that has drawn condemnation from Israeli leaders.\n\nThe decision against the Netzah Yehuda battalion is expected to be announced within days, the US news site Axios reported. It would be the first time Washington has placed sanctions on an IDF unit. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, criticised the move as the “height of absurdity” in a message on X/Twitter, while his coalition partner Benny Gantz wrote the sanctions would set “a dangerous precedent” and, in a telephone call later, asked Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, for a rethink.\n\nThe battalion, which had started as a unit for ultra-orthodox conscripts and attracted extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank, would not be eligible to receive US military aid or training. Washington has targeted several right-wing Israelis associated with the settler movement in the territory, including a senior aid to the hard-line national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nTimes, 22 April\n\nIsrael accused of possible war crime over killing of West Bank boy\n\nIn the early afternoon of 29 November last year, several Palestinian boys descended on to their street in the occupied West Bank, where they often played together. Minutes later, two of them lay dead from gunshots fired by Israeli soldiers – Basil, 15, and eight-year-old Adam.\n\nAs part of an investigation into the conduct of Israel’s security forces in the West Bank, which has been under military occupation for more than half a century, the BBC has pieced together what happened on the day the two boys were killed. Mobile phone and CCTV footage, information about the movements of Israel’s military, witness testimony and detailed investigation of the scene, including taking measurements, combine to reveal evidence suggesting serious human rights violations.\n\nThe evidence we found has prompted Ben Saul, UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, to say the death of Adam appears to be a “war crime”. Another legal expert, Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, described the use of lethal force as “indiscriminate”. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the circumstances of the deaths were “under review” but said “live fire is used only in order to remove immediate threats or for arrest purposes, following arrest protocols after exhausting other options”.\n\nWith violence having surged in the West Bank in the months since Hamas’s attack on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, the BBC has also found evidence of Palestinian homes being vandalised with graffiti, Palestinian civilians threatened with weapons and told to leave the territory for neighbouring Jordan, and the possible mutilation of the body of a Palestinian gunman.\n\nBBC News, 2 May\n\nBiden condemned violent campus protests\n\nPresident Biden delivered an unscheduled address from the White House today in which he denounced the violence and the antisemitism that have erupted on several college campuses. It is the first time the president has addressed at length the pro-Palestinian protests that have disrupted the end of the school year at dozens of universities coast to coast. “There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos,” Biden said. “People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.”\n\nBiden, however, rejected the idea of deploying National Guard troops to quell the protests, a move some Republicans have suggested. He also said that the protests — which vary in their demands, but typically call for an end to the war in Gaza — had not influenced his views on the war between Israel and Hamas. The demonstrations carried on: Hours ago, the police removed protesters who had been occupying a library at Portland State University in Oregon. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, activists erected 30 new tents, a day after a previous encampment was cleared. In total, nearly 2,000 arrests have been made nationwide. . . . Some colleges, including Brown and Northwestern, have ended encampments by striking deals with protesters, drawing criticism from some Jewish leaders.\n\nNew York Times, 2 May\n\nUK universities’ Gaza camps: Crafting in drizzle and pints at the pub\n\nClashes in the US have inspired activists, but so far Britain’s student protest movement is a more subdued affair. . . . Nobody has paid closer attention to events in the US than like-minded activist groups at Britain’s universities. On Wednesday, with tent bags in their hands and social media campaigns ready to launch, some of those pro-Palestinian groups invoked the disruption in the US as they called for British students to unleash a similar wave of protests. Penny Mordaunt, the Commons leader, warned on Thursday that protesters should expect an “extremely strict response” if the US tactics were replicated. Such an eventuality seems unlikely, however.\n\nTimes, 2 May\n\nCeasefire talks intensify in Cairo\n\nEfforts have intensified to secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, with talks resuming in Cairo on Saturday. Hamas said its delegation was travelling in a “positive spirit” after studying the latest truce proposal. “We are determined to secure an agreement in a way that fulfils Palestinians’ demands,” it said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “taking the ceasefire should be a no-brainer” for the militant group. Hamas’s negotiators have returned to the Egyptian capital to resume long-running talks – brokered by Egypt and Qatar – that would temporarily pause Israel’s offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. In a statement released last night, Hamas said it wanted to “mature” the agreement on the table, which suggests there are areas where the two sides still disagree.\n\nThe main issue appears to involve whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. Hamas is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel is reluctant to agree while the group remains active in Gaza. It’s thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\n\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted there will be a fresh military ground operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, even if a deal is agreed. Israeli media reported on Saturday that his position remained unchanged despite the latest round of talks. But the US – Israel’s biggest diplomatic and military ally – is reluctant to back a new offensive that could cause significant civilian casualties, and has insisted on seeing a plan to protect displaced Palestinians first. An estimated 1.4 million people have taken shelter in Rafah after fleeing the fighting in the northern and central areas of the strip.\n\nAddressing the prospects of a truce on Saturday, minister Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, said: “An official response to the outline has not yet been received. When accepted – the war management cabinet will meet and discuss it. Until then, I suggest to the ‘political sources’ and all decision-makers to wait for official updates, to act calmly and not to get into hysteria for political reasons.”\n\nThe Director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Williams Burns, has travelled to Cairo to help broker the latest talks, according to two US officials who spoke to the BBC’s US news partner, CBS News. Mr Blinken has also been a key figure in the negotiations, and visited Israel again this week to meet Mr Netanyahu. Speaking on Friday in Arizona, Mr Blinken said “the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire was Hamas”.\n\nBBC News, 4 May\n\nTens of thousands rally for hostage deal as Gaza ceasefire talks continue\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis rallied late into the night calling for a deal to bring hostages home, ahead of further ceasefire talks. Protesters in Tel Aviv chanted “war is not holy, life is”, with some accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of aiming to prolong the conflict. It came as a Hamas delegation met mediators in Egypt on Saturday. The group said there were no new developments, but added “a new round will begin” on Sunday.\n\nNegotiators have resumed long-running negotiations in Cairo – brokered by Egypt and Qatar – on pausing Israel’s offensive in Gaza in return for freeing hostages. The main sticking point appears to be whether the deal would be temporary or permanent. It is thought the wording being discussed involves a 40-day pause in fighting while hostages are released, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\n\nAn adviser to the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said the group was looking at the latest proposal with “full seriousness”. But he repeated a demand that any deal would have to explicitly include an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and complete end to the war. An anonymous Israeli government official told local media on Saturday that Israel would “under no circumstances agree to end the war as part of an agreement to free our abductees”. They added: “The IDF will enter Rafah and destroy the remaining Hamas battalions there – whether there is a temporary pause to free our captives or not.”\n\nBBC News, 5 May\n\nIsrael\n\nAttack of 7 October predicted\n\nEx-Mossad spy whose novel predicted October 7 fears for Israel’s future. Mishka Ben-David wrote book in 2017 in which Hamas attacks kibbutzim in the south and featuring an Iranian strike from the skies. His writing anticipated a Hamas attack on Israeli kibbutzim and an Iranian strike from the skies, but former Mossad spy turned thriller author Mishka Ben-David is now concerned about what lies ahead.\n\nSince the October 7 Hamas attack, one of 72-year-old Ben-David’s bestsellers has taken on an eerily prophetic tone. Published in 2017, “The Shark” describes a deadly conflict that starts with a Hamas terror raid on kibbutzim near the Gaza border and culminates in a devastating Israeli attack on Iran in retaliation. Last weekend, Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, which now appears to be preparing a response to this unprecedented attack. The vast majority of the missiles and drones were shot down by Israel and its allies.\n\nThe crisis is now “just a few steps” from the apocalyptic events envisioned in his book, Ben-David, the son of a Holocaust survivor, said calmly as he welcomed AFP to his home in the hills around Jerusalem. The dystopian opening pages of “The Shark” describe Hamas men breaking into Kibbutz Kfar Aza in southern Israel. Seven years after the book’s publication, the kibbutz was among the hardest hit in the Palestinian terrorist organization’s October 7 attack, with dozens killed. In total, terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 253.\n\nWhile researching for the book, the prolific author visited Israeli kibbutzim bordering Gaza, wondering: “Where would be the best place for Hamas to attack?” “I thought [the area] is not protected for a scenario like this,” he said. Ben-David, who served in Mossad for 12 years, is well placed to know that an army or intelligence agencies can fail.\n\nTimes of Israel, 18 April\n\nAnti-Semitism and Anti-Judaism\n\nBraverman calls for Met chief to quit over treatment of Jews\n\nFormer home secretary says Sir Mark Rowley ‘needs to accept responsibility’ after a ‘litany of failures’ in policing pro-Palestine protests. Suella Braverman is leading calls for the head of the Metropolitan Police to quit as the force faces mounting pressure after threatening to arrest an “openly Jewish” man during a pro-Palestine rally.\n\nThe former home secretary’s intervention comes as Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, suggested that Scotland Yard has been “disrespecting” Jews. Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, he said that it was “hard to think of any other minority that would be treated as disrespectfully as Jews seem to be”. Sir Mark Rowley has been summoned to a meeting with Chris Philp, the policing minister, who said he was “deeply concerned” by the Met’s handling of counter-protestors at Pro-Palestine rallies.\n\n“No one should be told their religion is provocative, nor an innocent person threatened with arrest solely because of someone else’s anticipated unreasonable reaction,” Mr Philp said. The Met has faced repeated criticism over pro-Palestinian marches, which have become regular weekend events in central London and have been criticised for displays of anti-Semitism. Two leading Jewish groups – the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the National Jewish Assembly – have added their voices to calls for Sir Mark to quit, while Lord Wolfson, a former justice minister, said the Met “needs a new approach and also, it would seem, new leadership”.\n\nGideon Falter, the Jewish man threatened with arrest, said last night: “The time has come for Sir Mark Rowley to go. He must resign or be removed by the Mayor of London and the Home Secretary. “What happened to me was a disgrace. Imagine what it felt like to be told by police officers that being ‘quite openly Jewish’ would ‘antagonise’ people and so I must leave the area on pain of arrest.” He added: “Sir Mark has the distinction of presiding over the worst surge in anti-Semitic criminality in our capital city since records began.”\n\nTelegraph, 20 April\n\nPolice deny involvement in covering up London Holocaust memorial\n\nThe memorial was hidden under blue tarpaulin while tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched on Saturday. The Holocaust memorial was the only monument in Hyde Park to be covered on Saturday. The Metropolitan Police have denied involvement in the decision to cover up London’s Holocaust memorial to protect it during pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nThe memorial in Hyde Park was covered in a blue tarpaulin on Saturday, as tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched from Parliament Square to a rally in Hyde Park. After the decision to cover the monument was reported, the Metropolitan Police released a statement distancing itself. It said: “The decision to cover the memorial was taken by park authorities, not the police.”\n\nHowever, a statement by the Royal Parks suggested planning for demonstrations was carried out in collaboration with the Met Police. A spokeswoman for the Royal Parks said: “During demonstrations and major events, the Royal Parks works closely with the Metropolitan Police to ensure the safety of park users and its environment.\n\nTimes, 29 April\n\nBBC correspondent says the broadcaster has a pro-Israel bias and should be questioning the ‘facts’ of October 7 – sparking fury among Jewish colleagues\n\nNovember poll found those sympathetic to Israel more likely to feel BBC biased towards Palestinian ‘side’, with Palestine ‘supporters’ believing the opposite. A BBC correspondent has accused the broadcaster of having a pro-Israel bias, urging his employer to question the ‘facts’ of Hamas’ October 7 attacks.\n\nRami Ruhayem, a Lebanon-based journalist for BBC Arabic, accused the BBC of bias in an email sent to hundreds of staff, prompting complaints from Jewish workers. In the correspondence, he claimed the BBC had failed to properly investigate claims made by Israel about Hamas’ deadly incursion into southern Israel last year. ‘Why does the BBC seem to have steered away from the growing body of evidence that casts doubt on the official Israeli version of the events of October 7?’ he wrote.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, but no other state has enriched to that level without producing them. Under a defunct 2015 agreement with world powers, Iran could enrich uranium only to 3.67%. After then-president Donald Trump pulled the US out of that deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, Iran breached the original deal and moved well beyond the its nuclear restrictions.\n\nReuters, 19 Feb.\n\nIran targets relatives and colleagues of London journalists\n\nThe Iranian regime has targeted journalists working in London by hauling their relatives before its intelligence ministry and blocking their colleagues from making financial transactions, documents show.\n\nA leaked memo from the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence outlines a campaign of fear and hostility against journalists who live abroad and produce independent reports about the state. Fifteen relatives of journalists, who work for the outlet Iran International which was forced by death threats to move from its west London headquarters last year, were summoned to meetings where they were warned that they faced “legal consequences”.\n\nThe regime also blocked more than 70 of the channel’s support staff from carrying out financial transactions in Iran in a move that it boasted had a “psychological impact resulting in stress and confusion”. The documents, leaked after a hacktivist group breached the servers of the Iranian judiciary, lift the lid on the campaign of intimidation being waged by Iran. MI5 has previously said that Tehran was behind more than a dozen assassination and kidnap plots in Britain.\n\nThe leak concerns tactics used by the regime after its bloody crackdown in late 2019 on protests that started over fuel prices. Reuters reported that about 1,500 people were killed after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, ordered officials to “do whatever it takes” to end the unrest. In a memo dated November 30, 2019, and marked top secret, a senior counterintelligence official told Tehran’s prosecutor-general, Ali Alghasi, that Iran International had broadcast interviews with people opposed to the regime.\n\nTimes, 22 Feb.\n\n‘I’m the top target for the brutal Iranian regime.’\n\nHossein Abedini, the Iranian dissident who has survived multiple attempts on his life, believes Tehran is becoming more desperate – and brutal.\n\nHossein Abedini, an Iranian dissident, was in the back of a car returning to his Westminster office following meetings in parliament earlier this month when he received his latest call from counter-terrorism police. The officer from Scotland Yard’s new hostile state threat unit was checking in to make sure he was taking all the necessary security precautions. Was he using licensed taxi companies? Did he have an alarm system? Don’t open the door to anyone, he was told.\n\nThe threat to Abedini’s life was regarded as so serious that the same unit had called him a couple of weeks earlier, in January. Detectives also visited him in his north London home just before Christmas. Abedini was not the only Iranian dissident living in London to receive such a visit. Officers went to see others, who, like him, had fled the regime, to warn them of an increased risk of violence and kidnapping given spiralling events in the Middle East.\n\nTimes, 2 March\n\nYemen\n\nHouthis claim they hit British ship, downed US drone over Yemen\n\nThe Houthi group says it hit a British cargo ship that is believed to be significantly damaged and shot down a US drone over its territory as the Yemeni group continued to target ships in the Red Sea demanding an end to Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThe Houthi claims of attacks come as the United States carried out five strikes in Yemen late on Saturday night as part of Washington’s military campaign after Houthi targeting of Israeli-linked vessels disrupted global trade passing through the Red Sea. Houthis have now expanded their attacks to include US and UK ships after the two countries launched strikes on the war-torn Arab nation.\n\nAl Jazeera, 19 Feb.\n\nRubymar, a UK-owned cargo ship hit by Yemen’s Houthis, sinks in Red Sea\n\nA cargo ship that was abandoned in the southern Red Sea after an attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels has sunk after days of taking on water, according to officials. The sinking of the Rubymar on Saturday has prompted concerns of disastrous ecological damage to the Red Sea and its coral reefs.\n\nThe Belize-flagged, United Kingdom-owned cargo ship, was carrying more than 41,000 tonnes of fertiliser and had leaked oil for several days after it came under attack. Yemen’s internationally recognised government, in a statement on Saturday, said the ship sank “last night, coinciding with weather factors and strong winds at sea”.\n\nThe United States military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) released an image of the vessel on its side and said it went under at 2:15am local time on Saturday (23:15 GMT on Friday). “The approximately 21,000 metric tons of ammonium phosphate sulfate fertilizer that the vessel was carrying presents an environmental risk in the Red Sea,” CENTCOM said in a statement. “As the ship sinks it also presents a subsurface impact risk to other ships transiting the busy shipping lanes of the waterway.”\n\nAl Jazeera, 2 March\n\nAllies have gone missing in Red Sea stand-off\n\n[Comment by Roger Boyes] It is a mark of the times that the bombardment of a critical world trading route is seen as a third-order problem. Yes, the United States and Britain are striking at the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels to stop the harassment of merchant vessels in the Red Sea but there is an astonishing lack of urgency among other mercantile nations to help them.\n\nNo one, it seems, has the appetite to join a western police force even when its mission — to secure the uninterrupted and safe passage of goods around the globe — is morally justifiable. The reluctance is down to two broad factors. The first is that US authority to lead is slipping away as the presidential election approaches. The second is that an armed western naval presence in contested waters might turn deterrence into a driver of escalation. . . .\n\nAs Emmanuel Macron’s presidential tenure winds down, so his suspicions about US leadership become more vocal. There are precedents for this. Charles de Gaulle reckoned America had more power than was good for it or good for the world. His challenge came in the 1960s when US limits were becoming obvious to everyone. Jacques Chirac, four decades later, warned against Washington’s unipolar omnipotence. De Gaulle’s warnings on Vietnam were not wrong, nor were Chirac’s on Iraq. But they set a pattern that Macron is increasingly willing to follow, even when, in the case of the Red Sea, there is a common western interest to be defended. Perhaps he is anticipating a new US presidency that will be indifferent to foreign crises or, under the Biden presidency, a drift towards war with Iran. . . .\n\nSo far the loss of life has been minimal but the loss of face is enormous. That is what happens when power starts to bleed away from a great power.\n\nTimes, 28 Feb.\n\nIsrael-Gaza\n\nNB: the Israel-Gaza conflict has been on the news daily in the past month. Only some individual episodes and comments are included here. At the moment, hope is being placed in a cease fire for the month of Ramadan, but so far no agreement has been reached. This conflict has also affected the political scene in the UK, which is discussed in a separate section after this one.\n\nA fifth of the Israeli hostages in Gaza are dead, Israel said\n\nAn internal Israeli intelligence report concluded that at least 30 of the remaining 136 Israeli hostages had died. That’s about a fifth of all the hostages who were captured by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nIn addition to the confirmed deaths, the report estimated that at least 20 other hostages may have been killed. The news is likely to add fuel to the push by the families of many hostages for Israel to prioritize a new hostage deal, instead of pressing ahead with its invasion of Gaza.\n\nIn related news, Hamas responded to a cease-fire framework that could free hostages in Gaza, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken cautioned that there was still “a lot of work to be done.”\n\nNew York Times, 6 Feb.\n\nBlinken: Israelis were dehumanized on Oct. 7; that can’t be a license to dehumanize others\n\nSecretary: IDF killing too many civilians. PM: Absolute victory within reach; no surrender to ‘delusional’ Hamas demands. Ex-hostage: ‘Saving the hostages would be absolute victory’.\n\n“We urge Israel to do more to help civilians, knowing full well that it faces an enemy that would never meet those standards,” says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a Tel Aviv press conference, adding that Hamas embeds itself among civilians and fires rockets from hospitals, mosques and schools. He calls Hamas “an enemy whose leaders surround themselves with hostages,” and says it is “an enemy that has declared publicly its goal to kill as many innocent civilians as it can, simply because they’re Jews, and to wipe Israel off the map.”\n\n“That’s why we’ve made clear that Israel is fully justified in confronting Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” Blinken says. “That’s why the United States has done more than any country to support Israel’s right to ensure that October 7 never happens again.” Nonetheless, he now uses caustic language to upbraid Israel on its conduct of the war in Gaza. “Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,” he says. “The hostages have been dehumanized every day since. But that cannot be a license to dehumanize others.”\n\n“The overwhelming majority of people in Gaza had nothing to do with the attacks of October 7,” he maintains. “The families in Gaza whose survival depends on deliveries of aid from Israel are just like our families. They’re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, who want to earn a decent living, send their kids to school, have a normal life. That’s who they are. That’s what they want. And we cannot, we must not, lose sight of that. We cannot, we must not, lose sight of our common humanity.”\n\nTimes of Israel, 7 Feb.\n\n[Editorial comment from David Horovitz]\n\nWith IDF hamstrung and Hamas scenting a way out, Netanyahu dodges strategic decisions\n\n. . . On the one hand, then, we have Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly insisting that the war will not end without “absolute victory” over Hamas and the return of all the hostages. And on the other, we have Hamas conditioning the return of the hostages on an end to the war in which it is anything but defeated. At the same time, we have a US administration wary of publicly demanding a permanent ceasefire, but despairing in the face of Netanyahu’s refusal to set out a vision for a postwar Gaza, publicly critical of the death and devastation in Gaza, seeking to turn the crisis into an opportunity to advance a two-state solution and wider regional reconciliation, and deeply invested in efforts to get the hostages out.\n\nThe complexity of the current situation is exacerbated by the IDF’s beyond-urgent need for political assistance as it is forced to repeatedly delay targeting the last major Hamas strongholds in Gaza, at Rafah and along the Gaza-Egypt border, in the absence of politically engineered coordination between Jerusalem and Cairo. . . .\n\nThe Israeli government is facing near-impossible, near-contradictory imperatives: It needs to defeat an enemy that has perpetrated the most monstrous attack on Israelis in our history — in order to ensure that October 7 cannot happen again, deter our other enemies, and restore our citizens’ security. And it needs to secure the release of civilian hostages who were failed by the state and whose fate is being cynically leveraged by the enemy that abducted them to try to secure survival.\n\nNobody envies the government the challenges it now faces. But it risks failing its people again the longer it refuses to so much as debate, much less decide on, its strategic vision for Gaza; the longer it denies the IDF the room for maneuver it needs to complete the dismantling of Hamas’s army; the longer it enables Hamas to remain the only political address in Gaza, increasingly commandeering the humanitarian aid entering the Strip; and the longer it exudes an intolerable political disunity and practical dysfunction utterly at odds with the cohesive fighting forces putting their lives on the line in Israel’s defense.\n\nIt is way past time for the prime minister to tell his far-right partners that, no, Israel is not going to permanently reoccupy Gaza; that it is not an Israeli interest to retake civil and financial responsibility for 2.3 million hostile Gazans; that Israel must urgently work with the relevant parts of the international community to create a mechanism for non-Israeli civil governance in Gaza, and that if this is not to their taste, they are welcome to leave the government. Endless bluster about “absolute victory” is meaningless without the practical political and military tools to attain it. And the only beneficiary of such paralyzing disunity at the top of Israeli governance is Hamas.\n\nTimes of Israel, 7 Feb.\n\nIDF intel assesses that Hamas will ‘survive as terror group’ post-war\n\nDocument drawn up by Military Intelligence reportedly states that even if Israel dismantles Hamas’s organized military capabilities, it will continue to operate in Gaza. Israel’s military intelligence circulated a document to Israeli leaders this week warning that even if the IDF succeeds in dismantling Hamas as an organized military force in Gaza, it will survive as “a terror group and a guerrilla group,” according to a Channel 12 report aired Thursday evening.\n\nThe document, drawn up by the research division of IDF Military Intelligence, reportedly also states that “authentic support remains” for Hamas among Gazans. Given that there is currently no practical effort being made to put in place a plan for Gaza on the “day after” the war, the document further warns, “Gaza will become an area in deep crisis.” Channel 12 investigative journalist Ilana Dayan reported that the document was presented on Monday to Israel’s political echelon, after it was discussed last weekend by senior IDF officers, Shin Bet officials and members of the National Security Council.\n\nThe “bottom line” is that the document constitutes a warning from those in military intelligence who carry out such assessments, said Dayan, that “Hamas will survive this [IDF] campaign as a terror group and a guerrilla group.” “In this regard, at least,” she suggested, “there won’t be absolute victory” — as predicted and demanded by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the start of the war.\n\nThe IDF Spokesman’s Office declined to comment on the TV report. While Israeli officials have consistently publicly declared the goal of the war to be wiping out Hamas from the Strip, many countries and officials around the world have warned that it is not a feasible outcome. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in November that while Israel can dramatically reduce the threat from Hamas, eliminating the group and its ideology is likely impossible.\n\nTimes of Israel, 16 Feb.\n\nSettlers riot in Palestinian West Bank village after terror attack, says rights group\n\nFootage of cars set alight in the Palestinian village of Burqa in the northern West Bank emerges following the alleged Palestinian terror attack which took place close to the nearby illegal Homesh outpost. The Yesh Din organization, which advocates against the settlement movement, says that residents of Burqa are reporting that Israeli settlers are rioting in the village and committing numerous acts of arson, and that some residents have been injured in the violence.\n\nAccording to Yesh Din, residents say that IDF forces are currently preventing Palestinian emergency services from reaching the area. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that “colonists” threw Molotov cocktails at a home, setting it ablaze along with a vehicle parked next to it, adding that the road between Burqa and nearby Sebastia has been closed by the IDF. The IDF says the rioters have dispersed and that it is looking into the reports of vandalism and arson in Burqa, saying it is unaware of any injuries in the incident.\n\nTimes of Israel, 19 Feb.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nNB: two issues arose relating to the Israel-Gaza conflict. One concerned the several pro-Palestinian demonstrations through this month; the other was the Rochdale by-election.\n\nLondon theatre cancels Douglas Murray’s pro-Israel event\n\nAn evening fundraising event for Israel’s Technion was cancelled on Sunday after staff at the Apollo Theatre in London refused to facilitate it. Alan Aziz, chief executive of Technion UK, said staff could choose whether or not to work at events on a Sunday, when the theatre is normally closed. Technion had put together the event — a conversation between writer and broadcaster Douglas Murray and actress Louisa Clein — just three weeks ago.\n\nHe told Jewish News: “The Apollo told us that they had struggled to put together enough staff to work at the evening, but that eventually they did have a working crew.” However, an unidentified person at the theatre chose, said Aziz, to distribute the email addresses of all those Apollo employees, to someone outside the theatre who was opposed to Israel. “All of them received threatening emails and told the management that they no longer wanted to work.” . . .\n\nMore than 800 tickets had been sold for the Apollo so it was vital for the Technion to locate another place large enough to accommodate such an audience. Eventually another venue agreed and almost 1,000 people turned up to hear Murray and Clein in conversation. . . . The following night, Murray addressed another capacity audience for the charity Emunah. In conversation with the journalist Sandy Rashty, he reflected on the domestic political scene ahead of a General Election this year and didn’t rule out entering politics himself in the future.\n\nJewish News, 5 Feb.\n\nIsraeli man and his friends are “hounded out of Soho Theatre”\n\nAn Israeli man and his friends were allegedly hounded out of London’s Soho Theatre by a large crowd after comedian Paul Currie encouraged his audience to chant ‘get the f*** out’ and ‘free Palestine’. The ‘absurdist’ comedian from Belfast is alleged to have produced a Palestinian and Ukrainian flag to use as props as his one-hour show came to a close at the central London theatre – which used to be a synagogue – on Saturday night. One member of the 200-strong audience said they started to feel ‘uneasy’ when Currie pulled the flags out and demanded the crowd stand and applaud – before he then allegedly launched a verbal attack on an Israeli man who stayed sat down.\n\nDaily Mail, 12 Feb.\n\nLabour withdraws support for Rochdale candidate after Israel-Gaza remarks\n\nLabour has withdrawn its support for Azhar Ali, its candidate for this month’s Rochdale byelection, in the wake of controversial comments he made about the 7 October attacks on Israel. In line with electoral law, Labour cannot replace Ali with another candidate because the deadline passed on 2 February. He will stand as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper, but if elected he will not hold the party whip and will sit as an independent MP. Labour sources said that campaigners in Rochdale were told to stop leafleting and social media activity on Ali’s behalf at 5.30pm on Monday – an instruction that came from party HQ.\n\nGuardian, 12 Feb.\n\nThree guilty of terror offence over paraglider images at UK Palestine march\n\nThree people who displayed images of paragliders at a pro-Palestinian march in central London a week after Hamas militants went on a bloody rampage in Israel have been found guilty of a terror offence. Heba Alhayek, 29, Pauline Ankunda, 26, and Noimutu Olayinka Taiwo, 27, were each given a 12-month conditional discharge.\n\nDeputy senior district judge Tan Ikram told them: “You crossed the line, but it would have been fair to say that emotions ran very high on this issue. Your lesson has been well learned.” The three were not seeking to show support for Hamas, he said. Alhayek and Ankunda attached images of paragliders to their backs with tape, while Taiwo stuck one to the handle of a placard. They displayed the images on 14 October 2023, a week after militants from Hamas used paragliders to enter Israel from Gaza on 7 October. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attack and about 240 were abducted and taken to Gaza.\n\nThe three protesters were charged under the Terrorism Act with carrying or displaying an article to arouse reasonable suspicion that they are supporters of a banned organisation, Hamas, which they denied. After a two-day trial at Westminster magistrates court, the three were found guilty on Tuesday after prosecutors argued it was “no coincidence” the defendants were displaying the images so soon after the attack.\n\nGuardian, 13 Feb.\n\nCalls to discipline judge who spared ‘paraglider women’\n\nA judge who “decided not to punish” three women who displayed paraglider images at a protest has come under fire after appearing to support a social media post calling for a “free Palestine”. . . .\n\nThe trio were spared jail after Deputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram said he had decided their lesson had been “well learned”. Now the judge is facing allegations of a possible conflict of interest amid claims he liked a message on LinkedIn which had been posted by a barrister accused of promoting conspiracy theories that Israel had allowed the October 7 attacks.\n\nLondon Evening Standard, 15 Feb.\n\nBritain’s new pro-Gaza MP George Galloway channels Trump\n\nLONDON — Pro-Palestinian firebrand George Galloway capped a remarkable parliamentary comeback Monday — and riffed on Donald Trump’s election-winning slogan. Galloway — a former Labour MP who was kicked out of the party in the 2000s amid a bitter row over the Iraq war — won the Rochdale by-election Thursday. He defeated Labour in a previously-safe seat after a divisive campaign in which he vowed to hammer his old party for its stance on the Israel-Hamas war. He was sworn in as the U.K.’s newest lawmaker Monday. . . . Following his win in Rochdale, Galloway — whose views on Israel and foreign policy have at times courted controversy — vowed to raise the plight of Palestinians in parliament and to be a thorn in the side of Labour.\n\nPolitico.eu, 4 March\n\nIsrael\n\nNetanyahu boasts of thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state ‘for decades’\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is introducing this evening in the Knesset legislation that would match a cabinet decision made yesterday to reject “international diktats” seeking to push Palestinian statehood — boasting of his decades of thwarting any such move. In a video statement, Netanyahu says that Israel is facing new pressures in recent days, in particular “an attempt to force upon us the unilateral establishment of a Palestinian state which will endanger the existence of the State of Israel.”\n\nNetanyahu says he is certain that the Knesset legislation will receive wide support after it passed unanimously in the cabinet, “and it will show the world that there is wide agreement in Israel against the international efforts to force on us a Palestinian state.” The prime minister adds that “everyone knows that I am the one who for decades blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger our existence.” His position, he says, only strengthened following Hamas’s October 7 massacre, and Netanyahu says that “no matter what, Israel will maintain full security control over all territory west on the Jordan River,” including both Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nTimes of Israel, 19 Feb.\n\nAnti-Semitism\n\nPrince of Wales condemns rising anti-Semitism\n\nPrince William has condemned a rise in antisemitism during a synagogue visit.\n\nThe Prince of Wales said it “has no place in society” as he met young people and students in London. He was told about an increase in antisemitism since the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza.\n\nIt was the prince’s first public appearance since pulling out of a memorial service due to a “personal matter”. He had been due to give a reading at Tuesday’s memorial for the late former King Constantine of Greece. While at the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in central London, the 41-year-old met a Holocaust survivor, and Jewish student representatives and young people who told him how they had been affected by antisemitism.\n\nBBC News, 1 March\n\nBBC is ‘institutionally anti-Semitic’ says former attorney general\n\nMPs have accused the BBC of fuelling attacks on Jews through biased reporting on the Israel-Hamas conflict. During a cross-party debate in Westminster Hall on Tuesday, former attorney general Sir Michael Ellis, said that senior BBC management had “fundamentally failed” to deal with biased coverage and mitigate the fears of Jewish staff. “The relentless bias of BBC News coverage has contributed to the record levels of intimidation and attacks on British Jews,” he added.\n\nSir Michael, Conservative MP for Northampton North, cited numerous instances of alleged bias, including the BBC’s refusal to call Hamas terrorists, which meant the corporation had become “complicit in Hamas’ well-orchestrated disinformation campaign”. Numerous politicians also made damning allegations against the BBC during the debate, which the cooperation has since refuted. According to several MPs, one inaccurate BBC report about the Al-Ahli hospital bombing in Gaza “led to a spike in antisemitism globally”, including the burning of synagogues in Tunisia and Germany.\n\nJewish Chonicle, 28 Feb.\n\nBook Review\n\nWhat Iranians Want: Women, Life, Freedom by Arash Azizi (Oneworld Publications, $28.00) 978-0-86154-711-1\n\nAn Iranian in exile, Azizi reveals his love for home and country in this exposé that supports the protest movement as much as it takes a critical stance. He breaks down the Iranian protests into categories: women’s rights, human rights, and the rights of refugees; the labor movement; the environment; freedom of expression and of religion; a demand for peace; and the abolition of the law of Compulsory Hijab. The discussions are backed up by ample examples from protest movements since 1979, such as the Green Revolution in 2009 and the national rallying around the death of an endangered Persian cheetah.\n\nWritten in a matter-of-fact way, the book presents facts and events well while leaving room for personal conclusions and reactions. It also interweaves the discontent of the present day with the broken dreams of the Islamic Revolution. It exposes how, from the beginning, the religious leaders of Iran were upfront with what kind of society they wanted to build, showing how supporters in Iran and in the West chose to ignore those who sounded the warnings.\n\nExcerpt from review of Erika Harlitz Kern, Foreward Reviews, 15 Feb.\n\nLester L.

According to a report in The Times this week, Wikipedia entries related to Iranian human rights abuses have been systematically altered in line with Tehran’s propaganda. In addition to downplaying Iranian atrocities and targeting its critics, the edits seek to present government publications as impartial sources. Specific instances involve the removal of details about mass executions in 1988 and the fact that current senior officials in the regime were involved in ordering the hanging of thousands of political prisoners.\n\nAnother example is misinformation about human rights activist Vahid Beheshti, who has been campaigning to put pressure on the UK government to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) as a terrorist group. Mattie Heaven, Beheshti’s wife, said four attempts were made to set up a page on the topic because there was so much misinformation online about her husband, but the text was repeatedly removed so the page could not function. “We believed it was the Iranian cyber army,” she said.\n\nOther deletions included references to the jailing of Iranian official Hamid Nouri, a key figure implicated in the 1988 massacre, in Sweden in 2022, and the expulsion of two Iranian diplomats from Albania in 2018 due to their alleged involvement in a bomb plot against dissidents. “Online misinformation is also a key tool for the regime,” The Times wrote. The campaign is in line with Supreme Leader’s Ali Khamenei’s call on supporters to come up with recounts of the global current affairs that benefit the regime, what he has dubbed “vindication jihad.”\n\nIran International, 12 Jan.\n\nIran said it would not hesitate to attack its foes\n\nAfter Iran struck targets in neighboring Pakistan, Iraq and Syria, the country’s defense minister vowed today that his country would “not set any limits” on using its military capabilities whenever necessary. “We are a missile power in the world,” he said. According to Iran, the attacks targeted terrorist groups — the Islamic State in Syria on Monday and Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan yesterday — as well as a location in Iraq that Iranian officials have said is an Israeli base for intelligence gathering. Analysts suggested that, for all of Iran’s belligerent comments, its attacks were measured, meant to flex its strength without inflaming regional tensions too much.\n\nNew York Times, 17 Jan.\n\nDissidents in London on high terror alert despite sanctions on Iran’s IRGC\n\nVigilance against threats from Iran has increased significantly despite sanctions being imposed, journalists threatened by Tehran have told The National. Officials at the London-based Iran International TV channel, which has found itself in Tehran’s crosshairs, say they “have to be lucky all the time” to avoid violent attacks.\n\nSecurity at the channel’s headquarters has been boosted, with counterterrorism police now in regular contact. The latest alert was raised hours before Britain imposed sanctions on senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leaders on Monday, after US troops were attacked on the Syria-Jordan border, sources told The National.\n\nAnti-Iranian dissidents in Britain have been warned by counterterrorism police that they face an increased risk of violence. Tensions have heightened with the likelihood of a strong American response to the death of three US soldiers in a drone attack launched by Iran-backed militias in Jordan. “The UK authorities are not complacent and are very alive to the threat,” said Adam Baillie, spokesman for Iran International. “We are on very, very high alert because we have to be lucky all the time and we can’t afford to make mistakes.”\n\nIranian dissidents across the capital are being warned by the security services of an increased risk of violence or kidnap due to the rising Middle East tensions. Sources have alleged to The National that the IRGC is using London-based criminals as proxies to carry out attacks against opponents of the Tehran regime. There is also concern that if Britain and Europe become more involved in conflicts in the Middle East, then Iran could increase its operations abroad, said Dr Sanam Vakil, a Middle East expert at the Chatham House think tank.\n\nThe National UK, 30 Jan.\n\nIran’s proxy war makes Islamic State a bigger threat, US general warns\n\nThe head of the United States-led ­coalition fighting Islamic State has said the militant group’s operations across the Middle East are being boosted by the fallout from the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMajor General Joel Vowell, who leads Operation Inherent Resolve, the mission against Isis in Iraq and Syria, said there had been a 200 per cent ­increase in suspected attacks by the group in the past three months.\n\nSince the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran-backed Shia militias have increased massively their attempted strikes on US bases across the region, culminating in a drone strike that killed three American troops in Jordan on Sunday and ­injured more than 30 others.\n\nThe strikes have forced “counter-Isis” troops to focus on defence, Vowell said. “All that focus has allowed, at the tactical level, Daesh [Isis] cells to start doing more things,” he said. “We have seen an uptick in attacks in Syria and Iraq in the last 60 days in particular.”\n\nTimes, 30 Jan.\n\nUS launches airstrikes on Syria and Iraq after Jordan attack\n\nBiden warns of consequences as 85 targets hit in retaliation for a deadly drone strike believed to have been carried out by Iran-backed militia. The US has launched a barrage of airstrikes on targets in Syria and Iraq in retaliation for last weekend’s drone attack on an American base in Jordan that killed three soldiers. In action that was wider than some had anticipated, warplanes, including B1 long-range bombers flown from bases in the US, as well as drones, hit 85 targets. Unlike recent strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, British forces were not involved in these attacks.\n\nPresident Biden said: “The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: if you harm an American, we will respond.” The strikes are likely to be the first of several against Iran-backed militia operating in the Middle East, threatening what some in Washington fear could spark a wider conflagration in the region. The Pentagon confirmed there had been multiple strikes. “US Central Command forces conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups,” the US military said, adding that attacks began at about 9pm GMT.\n\n“The airstrikes employed more than 125 precision munitions,” it added. “The facilities that were struck included command and control operations centres, intelligence centres, rockets, and missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicle storages, and logistics and munition supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against US and coalition forces.” The White House and the Pentagon have promised for a week that the US would respond to the attack in Jordan. John Kirby, the spokesman for the US national security council, said on Wednesday that the US’s retaliatory strikes could continue for some time.\n\n“The first thing you see won’t be the last thing,” he said, adding that the initial strikes would not be a “one-off”. Other officials said there would be a “tiered response” to the attacks in Jordan. On Friday night, Kirby said: “It began tonight, but it will not end tonight.” . . .\n\nThe strike against IRGC interests underlines Washington’s belief that Iran bears responsibility for the fatal attack on its base because Tehran arms and finances groups like Kataib Hezbollah. The strikes appeared to stop short of directly targeting Iran or senior leaders of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force within its borders. Tehran has denied it was behind the Jordan attack and on Friday morning, Iran’s hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, reiterated earlier promises by Tehran to retaliate for any American strikes targeting its interests. We “will not start a war, but if a country, if a cruel force wants to bully us, the Islamic Republic of Iran will give a strong response,” Raisi said.\n\nTimes, 3 Feb.\n\nYemen\n\nUS strikes multiple drones in Yemen, American official says\n\nWASHINGTON — The United States struck up to 10 unmanned drones in Yemen that were preparing to launch, a U.S. official said late on Wednesday, amid escalating tensions from the war in Gaza spreading through the region.\n\nA U.S. Navy ship also shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement. There were no injuries or damage reported, it said.\n\nThe Iran-aligned Houthi militants, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have launched a wave of exploding drones and missiles at commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in recent weeks, calling it a response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a show of solidarity to Palestinians.\n\nThe Houthi campaign has disrupted international shipping. The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and returned the militia to a list of “terrorist groups.” The Houthis, earlier on Wednesday, said their naval forces carried out an operation targeting an “American merchant ship” in the Gulf of Aden hours after firing missiles at U.S. Navy destroyer Gravely.\n\nHouthi attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea have slowed trade between Asia and Europe, raised fears of supply bottlenecks and alarmed major powers concerned that the Gaza war may become a regional conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden said earlier in January that strikes on Houthi targets would continue even as he acknowledged they may not be halting their attacks.\n\nReuters, 31 Jan.\n\nMiddle East expert says Iran could end Houthi attacks ‘plain and simple’\n\n. . . a third round of joint strikes was carried out by the US and UK, targeting Houthi targets in Yemen. The aim, we are told, is to try to deter further attacks against international shipping. The Americans said they had destroyed six anti-ship missiles that the Houthis were preparing to use. . . .\n\nThe Houthis’ position is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the key route. In reality, most ships that have been attacked have had no link to Israel. Washington and London say their aim is to stop the attacks that have disrupted global supply chains and caused major shipping companies to re-route their vessels. Both Iran and the US maintain that they to not want any further escalation.\n\nBenjamin Radd, a senior fellow with the UCLA Burkle Center for international relations, tells the BBC that if Iran opted to “cease funding, training and supplying intelligence, logistical support and weapons [to the Houthis], these attacks would come to an end – plain and simple”. “If and when Iran chooses to exercise that option it can do so,” Radd adds.\n\nBBC News, 4 Feb.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia ready to back US air strikes on Houthi rebels\n\nAntony Blinken’s efforts to prevent the Gaza war spilling across the Middle East are being complicated by Yemeni militia’s attacks on shipping. Saudi Arabia is among a number of Middle Eastern countries telling the West they back strikes against the Houthis in Yemen whose attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have diminished commercial traffic in the vital waterway.\n\nAny action against the rebels in Yemen would coincide with attempts by the United States to prevent the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas spreading to the rest of the region. The Palestinian group’s allies in Lebanon, Iran and Iraq have targeted Israel as well as US bases in the area and shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nTimes, 8 Jan.\n\nJordan\n\n3 U.S. service members killed, others injured in Jordan following drone attack\n\nThree U.S. soldiers were killed yesterday in Jordan, while more than 40 other service members were injured following an uncrewed aerial system attack at a military base near the Syrian border. Those service members were in Jordan to support Operation Inherent Resolve, which is the U.S. and coalition mission to ensure the defeat of ISIS.\n\nThe three soldiers killed are Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Georgia; Spc. Kennedy Ladon Sanders of Waycross, Georgia; and Spc. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett of Savannah, Georgia. All three were assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, 926th Engineer Battalion, 926th Engineer Brigade, Fort Moore, Georgia.\n\nThe attack occurred in the early morning at the logistics support base located at Tower 22 of the Jordanian Defense Network. Approximately 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel are deployed to the base. The three soldiers were killed when a one-way uncrewed aerial system impacted their container housing units.\n\n“I am outraged and deeply saddened by the deaths of three of our U.S. service members and the wounding of other American troops in an attack last night against U.S. and coalition forces, who were deployed to a site in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border to work for the lasting defeat of ISIS,” Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement released yesterday following the attack. “These brave Americans and their families are in my prayers, and the entire Department of Defense mourns their loss.” During a briefing at the Pentagon today, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said that in addition to the three deaths, more than 40 service members were also injured in the attack. Of those, eight had to be evacuated.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense, 29 Jan.\n\nSyria and Iraq\n\nSyria and Iraq respond to US air attacks\n\nSyria confirmed the strikes, saying that “US aggression” on a number of sites in its desert areas and the Syria-Iraq border had resulted in fatalities and injuries. Some reports put the early death toll at 18. “Syrian army affirms continuing its war against terrorism until it is eliminated and is determined to liberate the entire Syrian territories from terrorism and occupation,” the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe Iraqi military said the strikes were in the Iraqi border area and warned they could ignite instability. Major General Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for Iraq’s prime minister, called the strikes a “violation” of his country’s sovereignty and said they would bring “disastrous consequences for the security and stability of Iraq and the region”.\n\nMyriad Iran-backed groups operate in Syria and Iraq. US officials say the attack on its Tower 22 base in Jordan had the “footprints” of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the main Tehran-backed militant groups operating in Iraq and Syria. It said on Wednesday that it would end its attacks on US interests in the region out of respect for the Iraqi government.\n\nTimes, 3 Feb.\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan responds to Iran’s missile attacks\n\nHaving aided its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen, Iran decided to expand the area of its conflict by attacking posts in three countries, that are, to varying degrees, friendly to it: Syria, Iraq and Pakistan. The three attacks were in response to what the Islamic Republic believed were hostile activities that originated with the targeted countries. The Iranian attack on Syria was in response to the suicide bombings that killed nearly 100 people in Kerman, a city in Iran. . . .\n\nIran and its proxies had spent years battling the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria and Iraq, mostly known by its acronym, ISIS. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has relied heavily on Iran to fight the ISIS. Other countries have also targeted the ISIS: the United States, Israel and Turkey have dropped great amounts of explosives in the name of fighting terrorism. . . .\n\nAlthough the foreign ministers of Pakistan and Iranian had spoken on the telephone, Islamabad went ahead and retaliated for Tehran’s missile attack. It struck on January 18, two days after the Iranian missile operation. Pakistan used, said an official statement from Islamabad, “drones, rockets, loitering munitions and standoff weapons.” Both sides said they had targeted separatist militant groups that pose cross-border threats. The actions taken by the two countries against each other did not seem to be connected with the escalating conflict involving Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe Express Tribune, 29 Jan.\n\nIsraeli-Gaza War\n\nThe Gaza files that reveal Hamas paranoia before October 7\n\nSeized documents show that a diplomatic briefing note suggested pictures of Recep Tayyip Erdogan should be burned to sabotage Israel’s relations with Turkey. The Hamas leadership was considering undermining relations between Turkey and Israel in the period leading up to its October 7 attack, according to documents discovered by the Israeli army in Gaza.\n\nAccounts of meetings held in Gaza from 2022 and last year by Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s political leader, give an insight into the mindset of the Islamist group and its regional ambitions. Turkey’s leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has long been a key supporter of Hamas and of the Palestinian cause, while Turkey has been a base for Hamas members as well as a hub for recruitment and fundraising. But before October 7 there had been a growing rapprochement between the Turkish leader and Israel.\n\nA briefing prepared for Sinwar by one of his aides before a meeting between Erdogan and Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, in March 2022, states that “Turkey has been trying for a while to get close to the enemy for its own interests”. It adds: “Turkey doesn’t want to have a Palestinian environment which is hostile to its policy and doesn’t want to pay the price for normalising its ties with the enemy.”\n\nThe documents were discovered on a computer seized by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in recent weeks in Gaza. Israel launched a ground operation in early December in Khan Yunis, where the Hamas leadership has gone to ground. One of the first targets of Israeli troops was an office that had been used by Sinwar, who had fled underground and is believed to be hiding in the Hamas tunnel network.\n\nSunday Times, 7 Jan.\n\nBBC Apologizes For Reporting Unverified Hamas Claim Israel Was “Executing” Palestinians In Gaza\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The BBC has apologized for reporting an unverified Hamas claim about the Israeli army carrying out “summary executions” of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. BBC radio news bulletins reported Hamas’ allegation on Christmas Eve but the corporation said sufficient efforts were not made to corroborate the claim made by the designated terror group.\n\nThe source of the story appears to be news agency AFP, which reported that Hamas had gathered testimonies showing 137 Palestinians had been executed since the start of Israel‘s offensive. AFP said it could not verify the claim. The BBC radio bulletins quoted the Israeli military saying it was unaware of the incident and Hamas does not “value truth,” but it was not enough to prevent the broadcaster from issuing a correction.\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said: “In overnight output [on BBC radio news bulletins] we ran a story about Hamas accusing the Israeli army of carrying out summary executions in the Gaza strip. “This was a Hamas statement, but although the accusations were attributed and our story contained a response from the Israeli military saying they were unaware of the incident and that Hamas was a terrorist organisation that did not value truth, we had not made sufficient effort to seek corroborating evidence to justify reporting the Hamas claim. We apologise for this mistake.” It is not the first time the BBC has admitted to mistakes in its output on the conflict in Gaza. Last November, it apologized for reporting that Israeli troops targeted medics and Arab speakers during a raid on Gaza’s main hospital, Al-Shifa.\n\nDeadline, 9 Jan.\n\nIran’s aggression abroad masks fragility at home\n\nThe default position of many in the foreign policy establishment towards this “mystery” of Iran is one of awe. The Islamic republic enthusiastically cultivates an image abroad that it is a great chess player, always thinking several moves ahead. Recently we have been told that Iran is the chief beneficiary of the war in Gaza, that it has effectively supplanted the United States as the major power in the region and that it has achieved this by a remarkable sleight of (an invisible) hand.\n\nMuch of this is nonsense, sustained only by the willingness of an audience to believe it. The truth is the Iranian regime is more opportunistic than calculating, and more nervous of its surroundings than its image suggests. Plausible deniability might be said to be the hallmark of Iranian politics. In an unstable system with totalitarian pretensions, responsibility can carry heavy costs, so decisions by officials are better deferred.\n\nThis is procrastination born of fear. But Iran attempts to disguise it as coherent competence. There have always been those in Iran who detested the 1979 Islamic revolution and the republic it spawned but they were usually outnumbered by those who supported or tolerated it. In recent years this balance has tilted decisively against the regime.\n\nAli Ansari opinion piece, Sunday Times, 21 Jan.\n\nIsraeli special forces disguised as doctors kill three militants at West Bank hospital\n\nCounter-terrorism officers enter Jenin’s Ibn Sina hospital wearing doctors’ scrubs and women’s clothes. Israeli forces dressed in doctors’ scrubs and women’s clothes have killed three Palestinian militants in an undercover operation in a hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin.\n\nA border police counter-terrorism unit and a unit from the internal security forces, known as the Shin Bet, entered Ibn Sina hospital on the outskirts of the city’s refugee camp early on Tuesday, CCTV footage of the aftermath of the operation showed. The units made their way to a room on the third floor and shot all three men in the head using pistols fitted with silencers in an attack that took less than 10 minutes from start to finish, Israeli media said.\n\nA staff member who saw the attack told the Israeli daily Haaretz that only a few of the 12 or so special forces entered the room and shot the wanted persons; the others spread out over the hospital and the main entrance to prevent any disturbance. Israel’s military did not provide details on how the three were killed. Israel said the dead men were Mohammad Jalamana, a spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing, Basel Ghazawi, of Islamic Jihad, and his brother Mohammed. All three were allegedly active in the umbrella force known as the Jenin Battalion, a newly formed group that has engaged Israeli forces in fierce fighting during raids in the lawless city over the past two years.\n\nThe Israeli authorities said the three men had been involved in planning an attack similar to the one launched by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on 7 October that killed 1,140 people, according to Israeli data, and sparked the latest war in Gaza, which has killed 26,000 people in the strip, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. About 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced from their homes in the dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nHamas claimed Jalamana as a member, while the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said the two brothers were part of their Jenin cell. . In a statement, Hamas called the killings “a vile crime that will not go without response”. It said: “The resistance forces, who have sworn to fight the occupation until it is expelled, are not afraid of the assassination policy.”\n\nGuardian, 30 Jan.\n\nHamas says truce proposal ‘still being studied’ as Israeli war cabinet meets on deal\n\nQatar ‘optimistic’ after receiving ‘initial positive confirmation’ from terror group on hostage agreement, but source close to Hamas says Qatari statement was ‘rushed and not true’. Hamas has given “initial positive confirmation” to a proposal for the cessation of fighting in Gaza and the release of hostages, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman asserted Thursday, but the Palestinian terror group swiftly denied doing so.\n\n“That proposal has been approved by the Israeli side and now we have an initial positive confirmation from the Hamas’ side,” Majed al-Ansari told an audience at a Washington-based graduate school. “There is still a very tough road in front of us. We are optimistic because both sides now agreed to the premise that would lead to a next pause. We’re hopeful that in the next couple of weeks, we’ll be able to share good news about that,” he added.\n\nThe comments at Johns Hopkins University briefly triggered some celebrations in Gaza, including festive gunfire, and a drop in the price of crude oil. A Qatari official clarified to Reuters that there was “no deal yet” and that although “Hamas has received the proposal positively,” Qatar was “waiting for their response.”\n\nBut a Hamas official told Reuters a short while later that the terror group has “received the Paris truce proposal but we haven’t given response to any of parties, it is still being studied.” “We cannot say the current stage of negotiation is zero and at the same time we cannot say that we have reached an agreement,” said Taher al-Nono, the media adviser of Qatar-based Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nTimes of Israel, 2 Feb.\n\nHow Israel’s flooding of Gaza’s tunnels will impact freshwater supply\n\nPumping of seawater will contaminate underground freshwater and ruin the conditions of life in Gaza, experts say. Israel confirmed this week that its troops are pumping seawater into a network of tunnels in Gaza, a method environmentalists say could violate international law and cause dire, long-term consequences in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nMedia reports have for weeks speculated that the pumping was under way, though Israeli and US officials, including President Joe Biden, did not confirm them when questioned. But on Wednesday, in a short statement on X, the Israeli military said it is using “new capabilities” in its war on Gaza and on Hamas’s labyrinth of tunnels, “including by channeling large volumes of water into them”.\n\nAl Jazeera, 3 Feb.\n\nIsrael\n\nAt the heart of Netanyahu’s government as he faces war on home front\n\nIsrael’s ‘protector’ failed to foresee the Hamas attacks and polls show he would lose an election – and could even face jail. But with his war cabinet divided, the ruthless operator may have a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\nIsrael likes to remember its prime ministers in statues and street names. In Tel Aviv, Yitzhak Rabin, who won the Nobel peace prize for signing a peace deal with the Palestinians, has his own square. Yigal Alon has various streets named after him despite holding the job for barely a month half a century ago. But things might be different for the country’s longest-serving prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. “He wants to be remembered in a positive way in Israel’s history,” said Aviv Bushinsky, his former spokesman, “but if he were to step down tomorrow, I’m doubtful he’d even get an alley.”\n\nNetanyahu wanted to be known as “the protector of Israel’s security”. But he failed to prevent the worst tragedy in the country’s history, when Hamas militants massacred some 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7. In response more than 25,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed by Israeli forces, prompting international outrage. Almost four months after launching the war on Gaza, where 24 young Israeli soldiers were killed on a single day early last week and where more than 100 Israelis are being held hostage by Hamas, Netanyahu, 74, is in deep political peril. . . .\n\nBut it would be rash to bet on Netanyahu abandoning power any time soon without a desperate struggle: over the years he has developed a reputation as a shrewd and ruthless political operator. It helps him that there is no obvious replacement. “He managed to eliminate anyone who could be a successor,” said Eiland. “He works exactly according to the guidelines written by Machiavelli 500 years ago.” . . .\n\nNetanyahu, who was prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009 to 2021 before returning to power in 2022, will be ready to confront any threat. “What drives him is paranoia, ‘This guy’s gonna screw me, these politicians are thinking of toppling me’,” said Bushinsky, the former spokesman who served Netanyahu for seven years from 1997 to 2007. “But by being so paranoid, you are always prepared, you’ll never be caught off-guard.”\n\nMichael Oren, a former Knesset member and ambassador to the US under Netanyahu from 2009 to 2013, likes to recall the apocryphal remark of Louis XIV, “l’état c’est moi” (“the state is me”), to describe Netanyahu’s attitude towards power. He believes the prime minister has lost legitimacy. But that does not mean he is finished. “Can he continue in power?” Oren asked. “It’s always premature to elegise him politically. That’s one thing I’ve learnt over the years about Netanyahu.”\n\nSunday Times, 28 Jan.\n\nAnti-Semitism\n\nMusk admits naivity about anti-Semitism\n\nElon Musk expresses shock about the Holocaust after Auschwitz visit that was ‘incredibly moving, and deeply sad and tragic that humans could do this to humans’. Musk was seen carrying his son on his shoulders in a photo of the tour, as he stood alongside Rabbi Menachem Margolin, the chairman of the European Jewish Association, Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev, and Ben Shapiro, a controversial conservative media pundit.\n\nShapiro later hosted a discussion with Musk, organized by the EJA in nearby Krakow, during which Musk championed his social platform, formerly Twitter. Without making a direct reference to an antisemitic post that he amplified in November — triggering widespread criticism and a halt to advertising of major brands including Apple Inc. and Walt Disney Co. — the billionaire issued a mea culpa of sorts.\n\n“Once in a while I’ll do something dumb, for sure,” he said. As Musk has fought off charges of amplifying antisemitism, he traveled to Israel in November where he met with leaders including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, and saw the sites where 1,200 people were murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7.\n\nFortune, 22 Jan.\n\nNowhere is safe to be Jewish now\n\nDame Maureen Lipman has said that “nowhere is safe” for Jewish people. Speaking before Holocaust Memorial Day tomorrow, the actress . . . said that her parents’ graves were under lock and key because of antisemitic attacks. She said that in the present climate, “[you] can’t take anything for granted”. . . . “One of the problems is, if you listen to the radio and you listen to the media, you will constantly hear the ‘Jews and the Palestinians’, not the Palestinians and the Israelis . . . or the Jews and the Muslims, which makes it a level playing field.” She added: “It just . . . drip-feeds into the idea that Jews are responsible for the ills of the world.”\n\nTimes, 26 Jan.\n\nTracy-Ann Oberman: Shylock, me and today’s surge in anti-Jewish hatred\n\nThe actress has needed extra security for her staging of The Merchant of Venice. She talks about reclaiming Shakespeare’s play, battling antisemitism and resisting culture wars. . . .\n\nLast night she performed her Shylock to a full house, and to another audience quite unlike any she has experienced. At the interval, the bar was noisy with schoolboys in yarmulke and friends swapping family history; the woman next to me in the stalls cried. The show, which relocates Shakespeare’s play to the East End of London at a time when Oswald Mosley’s fascist militia terrorised the Jewish population, has grown from its original four-week run into a year-long tour that Oberman describes as “a movement”. . . .\n\nOberman’s adaptation, developed with the director Brigid Larmour since 2018 and drawing on her family history, is part faithful adaptation (with all the slow bits excised), part exhortation to stand up against antisemitism. The production begins with Oberman presiding over shabbat and ends with a call for unity; last night the audience joined her in both, crowding onto the stage in a noisy finale.\n\n. . .\n\nOberman’s great-grandmother escaped the pogroms of Belarus in 1905, coming to London at the age of 15; her great-uncle Al was thrown through a window by a member of Mosley’s militia. The 1936 Battle of Cable Street, in which the blackshirts were resisted by an alliance of the Jewish, Irish, English and Somali working class, was woven into family lore and forms the backdrop to Oberman’s production.\n\nTimes Saturday Review, 3 Feb.\n\nLester L.

The attack in Kerman in southern Iran killed 84 people and wounded many more. The death toll was revised down on Thursday morning by the head of Iran’s emergency services from an earlier figure of 95.\n\nThe Islamic State group (IS) said it carried out the attack. It made the claim via its channels on Telegram. IS has attacked civilians and security forces in Iran on a number of occasions in recent years. It welcomed the 2020 death of Gen Soleimani, whose militias fought against the group in Iraq for years. Iranian officials said at least one blast was caused by a suicide bomber. “Cruel criminals must know that they will be strongly dealt with from now on and undoubtedly there will be a harsh response,” Khamenei said in a statement on Wednesday evening.\n\nEarlier, President Ebrahim Raisi’s political deputy, Mohammad Jamshidi, blamed Israel and the US. However the US said it had no indication that Israel was involved and dismissed any suggestion that Washington was involved. Soleimani was seen as the most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader before he was killed in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq in 2020.\n\nBBC News, 4 Jan.\n\nIraq\n\nU.S. strike killed an Iran-allied militant leader\n\nA U.S. drone strike in Baghdad today killed the leader of a militant group linked to Iran that is part of Iraq’s security apparatus. The Pentagon described the strike on a commander of the Harakat al-Nujaba group as “necessary and proportionate,” and said that no civilians were harmed.\n\nThe U.S. has recently taken several retaliatory actions against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have repeatedly attacked American bases. But until now they had largely avoided the dense capital city. The Iraqi government called the attack a “flagrant violation of the sovereignty and security of Iraq” and “no different from a terrorist act.” The strike comes after a series of attacks that have threatened to bring the Middle East — and the U.S. — closer to the brink of a regional war, which the Biden administration has tried to stave off since Hamas’s deadly attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nNew York Times, 4 Jan.\n\nLebanon\n\nKilling of senior Hamas leader in Beirut raises stakes in Israel war\n\nSenior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri knew his days were numbered. “It’s not unusual for the commanders and officers to be martyred,” the militant group’s deputy political leader said last year when asked about Israeli threats to assassinate him. “I think I’ve lived too long.”\n\nBeirut-based Arouri on Tuesday became the most senior Hamas casualty of the war when he was killed by a suspected Israeli drone attack in the Lebanese capital, along with two commanders and four other members of the movement.\n\nThe death of Arouri, one of the founders of Hamas’s military wing, marks a significant blow to the group and underscores Israel’s determination to pursue its top leaders in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nIsrael has not admitted involvement. But David Barnea, head of Mossad, on Wednesday said his spy agency was “committed to settling accounts” with everyone involved in the assault, regardless of how long it takes or where they are based. The strike risks escalating hostilities between the Jewish state and the Lebanon-based militant group Hizbollah, who have traded almost daily exchanges of fire since the war began. The blast took place in Iran-backed Hizbollah’s south Beirut stronghold, and Arouri was said to be close to the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nThe 57-year-old was regarded as a key Hamas figure in the Iran-backed militant network stretching from the Palestinian territories to Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. He was also integral to Hamas’s operations in the occupied West Bank, where the group has been gaining popularity. “His death is a significant blow for Hamas,” said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. “Not just as a founder of the Qassam Brigades [the military wing] but also his role in terms of leading Hamas in the West Bank.”\n\nFinancial Times, 3 Jan.\n\nYemen\n\nUS-led coalition warns Houthis of ‘consequences’ after Red Sea attacks\n\nA group of countries led by the United States have warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels of “consequences” unless they stop their attacks on Red Sea shipping vessels. “Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,” said the statement released by the White House on Wednesday.\n\n“The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways”. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan are among the 12 signatories. The only country in the Middle East to sign the statement was Bahrain, which has a strained relationship with Iran, which is aligned with the Houthis.\n\nThe statement comes after several reports that US President Joe Biden’s administration is considering direct strikes on the rebels if the attacks continue. The Houthis have said that their attacks in the busy waterway are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and that they are targeting ships with links to Israel. The US has sent an aircraft carrier, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, to the area and earlier announced a coalition of countries to protect movement in the Red Sea, through which 12 percent of global trade passes.\n\nAl Jazeera, 3 Jan.\n\nTurkey\n\nErdogan says Israeli PM Netanyahu no different from Hitler\n\nANKARA, Dec 27 (Reuters) – Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was no different from Adolf Hitler and likened Israel’s attacks on Gaza to the treatment of Jewish people by the Nazis. NATO member Turkey, which supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has criticised Israel’s air and ground assault on Gaza, called it a “terror state” and said its leaders must be tried in international "
