        "text": "Heston, born John Charles Carter in Evanston, Illinois, served in the Air Force and ran a North Carolina playhouse before becoming a star. His breakthrough role was in 1952's The Greatest Show on Earth, but the part that would make him world famous was his portrayal of Moses in 1956's The Ten Commandments.\n\nHe followed that success with a string of leading roles in historical epics like El Cid, 55 Days at Peking, The Agony and the Ecstasy, and Khartoum. Heston won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in Ben-Hur.\n\nDuring the '60s and '70s Heston made his mark on the sci-fi genre starring in Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, The Omega Man, and Earthquake.\n\nLate in his career, the veteran actor continued appearing in stage productions, and made memorable big-screen cameos in such films as Tombstone, True Lies, and Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.\n\nOff-screen, Heston became most famous for his political activism. He was a staunch advocate for civil rights and marched on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1963. By the 1980s, Heston's political passions had shifted to protection of the Second Amendment. He served as the president and spokesman of the National Rifle Association for five years.\n\nHeston's impact on American pop culture is far-reaching, from his widely known Apes quote (\"Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty apes!\") to obscure references in the videogame Postal (Postal Dude considers him \"his President\").\n\nIn 2002, Heston announced he was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. The following year he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nHeston died on April 5, 2008, at the age of 84."
