        "text": "AKA John Charlton Carter\n\nBorn: 4-Oct-1923 [1]\n\nBirthplace: Evanston, IL\n\nDied: 5-Apr-2008\n\nLocation of death: Beverly Hills, CA\n\nCause of death: Natural Causes\n\nRemains: Cremated\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Protestant\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nParty Affiliation: Republican\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: The Ten Commandments\n\nMilitary service: US Army Air Corps (WWII, Sgt.)\n\nCharlton Heston's parents were divorced when he was ten, and he was raised by his mother and, later, stepfather. He studied drama at Northwestern University, where he first stepped before the camera at age 16 in a student-filmed silent production of the Henrik Ibsen play, Peer Gynt.\n\nAs an actor, Heston is most famous for larger-than-life roles in a series of epics, including Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958), Ben-Hur (1959), which won him an Oscar, El Cid (1961), and the underrated Khartoum (1966). And then there's Planet of the Apes (1968), Soylent Green (1973), the disaster flicks Airport (1974) and Earthquake (1975), and TV's The Colbys (1985-87), an uninspired spin-off of Dynasty.\n\nOff screen, Heston was active in the civil rights movement, and marched on Washington DC with Martin Luther King in 1963. Later in life he served as president of the National Rifle Association from 1998 to 2002. As NRA chief, Heston once held a 1776-era musket and uttered his most famous line: \"I have only five words for you: From my cold, dead hands.\"\n\n[1] Heston's original New York Times obituary gave 1924 as his year of birth, the newspaper later issuing a correction to 1923 without explanation. This would make him 84 at the time of his death. Heston's obituary in The Chicago Tribune gave 1924 as his birth year. Current Biography first profile on Heston (1957) gave 1924 but this was amended by his second profile in 1986 with a question mark, suggesting 1922, 1923, or 1924 as possible years, and October 4 or October 6 as possible days.\n\nFather: Russell Whitford Carter\n\nMother: Lilla Charlton Carter\n\nFather: Chester Heston (stepfather)\n\nWife: Lydia Marie Clarke (m. 17-Mar-1944)\n\nSon: Fraser Clarke Heston (screenwriter and actor, b. 12-Feb-1955)\n\nDaughter: Holly Ann Heston (adopted, b. 1961)\n\nHigh School: New Trier High School, Winnetka, IL (1941)\n\nUniversity: Northwestern University\n\nNational Rifle Association President (1998-2003)\n\nScreen Actors Guild President (1966-71)\n\nOscar for Best Actor 1960 for Ben-Hur\n\nKennedy Center Honor 1997\n\nPresidential Medal of Freedom 23-Jul-2003\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame 1620 Vine St.\n\nNational Cowboy Hall of Fame 2010\n\nAccuracy in Media National Advisory Board\n\nKennedy Center Trustee Emeritus\n\nNicaraguan Freedom Fund Board of Directors\n\nReagan-Bush '84\n\nUS English Advisory Board\n\nVisited Disneyland on Opening Day\n\nVisited Disneyland Candlelight Procession (Dec-1970)\n\nHip Replacement Surgery\n\nRisk Factors: Alzheimer's, Prostate Cancer\n\nTELEVISION\n\nThe Colbys Jason Colby (1985-87)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS DIRECTOR\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1988)\n\nMother Lode (15-Oct-1982)\n\nAntony and Cleopatra (2-Mar-1972)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nHail Satan?
