        "text": "Charlton Heston (October 4, 1923 â€“ April 5, 2008) was an American actor and political activist. He had many big roles, such as playing Moses in the movie The Ten Commandments, astronaut Colonel George Taylor in Planet of the Apes (1968) and Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), the dystopian The Omega Man (1971), and Soylent Green (1973). Heston played Judah Ben-Hur in the Academy Award-winning Ben-Hur.\n\nHe was born in Wilmette, Illinois on October 4, 1923. He was raised in St. Helen, Michigan. Heston studied at New Trier High School and at Northwestern University.\n\nHeston was also known for his politics. When he was young he held liberal views and marched with people such as Martin Luther King, Jr. for civil rights in the 1960s.\n\nIt was rare for a Hollywood actor to be for such causes at that time. Later in his life, he was for conservative causes such as gun rights. He was president of the National Rifle Association of America, a group that is for the rights of gun owners, from 1998 to 2003.\n\nIn July 2003, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House from President George W. Bush.\n\nLate in his life, Heston had Alzheimer's disease. He died of pneumonia, aged 84, in Beverly Hills, California.[2][3]\n\nMedia related to Charlton Heston at Wikimedia Commons"
