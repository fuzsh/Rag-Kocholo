        "text": "Recently we told you about the most famous people from each of Michigan's 83 counties. One of our guidelines was those celebs had to have a Michigan birthplace. That means many very well-known Michiganders were left out because — SURPRISE — they weren't born here.\n\nNow we have a look at some of the most famous Michiganders who weren't born in our state but definitely called it home.\n\nTim Allen\n\nWhile he is the voice of Pure Michigan, actor Tim Allen doesn't exactly fit that description. Widely known for his role on the long-running television series \"Home Improvement\" and as the voice behind beloved \"Toy Story\" character Buzz Lightyear, Allen was born June 13, 1953 in Denver, Colorado. Allen's family moved to Michigan when he was a teenager and clearly the Western Michigan University graduates made the Great Lakes State his home.\n\nBy Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America - Gillian Anderson Uploaded by Dudek1337, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27403360\n\nGillian Anderson\n\n\"The X-Files\" star Gillian Anderson was born Aug. 9, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois. Widely known for playing Dana Scully, Anderson moved to Grand Rapids as an 11-year-old child. She was active in theater during her years in Grand Rapids and, in addition to her time on \"The X-Files,\" Anderson has spent time on the stage and in film.\n\nPhoto by Cathy Layman | MLive.com\n\nFred Bear\n\nWhile he left his mark on Michigan, bow-hunting legend Fred Bear wasn't born a Michigander. He was born March 5, 1902 in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. Bear has left a lasting impression on Grayling, Michigan, where his archery company was based for many years. Fellow Michigan hunter Ted Nugent immortalized Fred Bear in his 1995 song of the same name.\n\nPhoto by Bruce Edwards | MLive.com\n\nKen Burns\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Ken Burns graduated from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, but the Michigan city isn't his birthplace. Burns was born July 29, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York but moved to Michigan when his father took a job working at the University of Michigan. Popular documentaries created by Burns include \"Jazz,\" \"Baseball\" and \"The Civil War.\"\n\nPhoto by Tyler Stabile | MLive.com\n\nJeff Daniels\n\nLuckily for us, Michigan only had to live without actor and musician Jeff Daniels for the first 6 months of his life. While he was born Feb. 19, 1955 in Athens, Georgia, his family quickly moved to Chelsea, Michigan, where his father once served as mayor. You can spot Daniels on the now-ended HBO series \"The Newsroom,\" as well as numerous films like \"Dumb and Dumber\" and the Michigan classic \"Escanaba in da Moonlight.\"\n\nPhoto by Jim Cheek | MLive.com\n\nEminem\n\nMarshall Mathers III, better known as Eminem, is one of our most famous Michiganders. Surprisingly, though, the award-winning rapper wasn't born in our state. Born Oct. 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, Missouri, Mathers was a kid when his mom moved the family to Michigan. His life in Detroit was chronicled in the 2002 film \"8 Mile.\"\n\nPublic Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=511634\n\nBetty Ford\n\nFirst lady as wife of Gerald Ford, Betty Ford is known for her effort to bring alcohol and rug addiction to the attention of the American public. Born April 8, 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, Ford — born Elizabeth Bloomer — grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she married Gerald Ford in 1948.\n\nPhoto by Curtis T. Leece | MLive.com\n\nGerald Ford\n\nMichigan can't claim any U.S. president as a state native but Gerald Ford is the closest we've come. Ford was born with the name Leslie Lynch King Jr. July 14,1913 in Omaha, Nebraska. When the future president was just a small child, Ford's mother brought him to Grand Rapids. The University of Michigan (and later Yale) graduate served as vice president after Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 and then was thrust into the position of president once Richard Nixon resigned the next year.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Lippitt | MLive.com\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nLegendary singer Aretha Franklin is known to live in the great city of Detroit but that isn't where she was born. Winning the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance Grammy Award 11 times, Franklin was morn March 25, 1942 in Memphis, Tennessee. She was short of her fifth birthday when her family moved to Detroit. The \"Respect\" singer still lives in Michigan to this day.\n\nBy mwlguide (Ernie Harwell) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nErnie Harwell\n\nWilliam Harwell, better known as Ernie Harwell, was the voice of Detroit Tigers baseball, even though he wasn't born in Michigan. Harwell was born Jan. 25, 1918 in Washington, Georgia. He started working with the Tigers in 1960 and died in Novi, Michigan on May 4, 2010. He is considered by some as one of the best broadcasters in sports history.\n\nPhoto by Jennifer Jankowski | MLive.com\n\nCharlton Heston\n\nLate actor Charlton Heston spent his boyhood in St. Helen, Michigan but he wasn't born there. He wasn't even born in Michigan. Heston, who was also known for his political activism and time as president of the National Rifle Association, was born in Illinois on Oct. 4, 1923. That's where his family returned after about a decade spent in St. Helen.\n\nPhoto by Bryan Bennett | MLive.com\n\nDerek Jeter\n\nHe is claimed by Kalamazoo, but baseball great Derek Jeter was born June 26, 1974 in Pequannock, New Jersey. Of course, his family did move to K-zoo before he even reached school age. The former New York Yankee was voted an All-Star 14 times and helped the Yankees win the World Series five times during his career.\n\nPhoto by Marcia Butterfield | MLive.com\n\nJames Earl Jones\n\nAs a young child, James Earl Jones moved to Brethen, Michigan, where he would grow up and graduate high school before pursuing higher education at the University of Michigan. Before Jones, who is widely known for his voice, became a Michigan resident, he was born Jan. 17, 1931 in Arkabutla, Mississippi. Some of his most well-known voice acting roles include Darth Vadar in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy and Mufasa in Disney's \"The Lion King.\"\n\nBy Carl Van Vechten - Van Vechten Collection at Library of Congress, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=616866\n\nJoe Louis\n\nLate, great professional boxer Joe Louis was the world heavyweight champion and is celebrated in Detroit with an arena that bears his name. But Louis was not born in Michigan. In fact, Louis spent the first 12 years of his life in LaFayette, Alabama, where he was born May 13, 1914. He is credited with helping to integrate professional golf when he appeared at a PGA event under Chevrolet's sponsor exemption.\n\nBy NBC Television (eBay front back) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nJack Paar\n\nJack Paar was a host of \"The Tonight Show\" on NBC during the late 50s and early 60s. While he was born May 1, 1918 in Canton, Ohio, he was raised in Jackson, Michigan. Paar got his start in Michigan radio at stations like WJR in Detroit.\n\nPublic domain photo\n\nRosa Parks\n\nRosa Parks made history in Alabama, where she was born Feb. 4, 1913 in Tuskegee. Later in life, and after taking a stand on a segregated Alabama bus, Parks moved to Detroit. She worked in Detroit for U.S. Rep. John Conyers and retired there before she died in Detroit Oct. 24, 2005.\n\nBy The original uploader was Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) at English Wikipedia - This image is available from the United States Library of Congress's Prints and Photographs division under the digital ID ggbain.16071.This tag does not indicate the copyright status of the attached work.

Post\n\nKnown as a cereal pioneer, C.W. Post made a lasting mark on Battle Creek but he was born May 9, 1914 in Springfield, Illinois. In the last two decades of his life, Post took up residency in Battle Creek, where he started his still-popular cereal company.\n\nBy Randall Studio - National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8866087\n\nSojourner Truth\n\nSpending the later years of her life in Michigan, civil rights hero Sojourner Truth was born in New York in 1797. Truth, born Isabella Baumfree, escaped slavery and fought for civil rights as an abolitionist and women's rights activist. She died Nov. 26, 1883 in Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nMLive file photo\n\nMatt Urban\n\nReferred to as America's most decorated infantry officer of World War II, Lt. Col. Matt Urban lived his later years in Michigan but was not born in the state. Urban was born Aug. 25, 1919 in Buffalo, New York. Receiving a Medal of Honor, the Purple Heart and many other military honors, Urban lived in Holland, Michigan during his adult life until the time he died March 4, 1995.\n\nBy Herman Hiller, World Telegram staff photographer [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMalcolm X\n\nCivil rights activist Malcolm X was born May 19, 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska as Malcolm Little. When he was still a baby, his family moved to Lansing, Michigan. Malcolm X also lived for a short time in Flint years before gaining prominence in the civil rights movement.\n\nPhoto by Chris Clark | MLive.com\n\nGinger Zee\n\nMichigan's most famous meteorologist (sorry, Mark Torregrosa) wakes up before the sun each morning to deliver the forecast on \"Good Morning America.\" But, believe it or not, our own Ginger Zee wasn't always ours. She was born Jan. 13, 1981 in California but, of course, her real home town is Rockford, Michigan.\n\nMore about Michigan\n\nIf you are a fan of the great state of Michigan, check these out:\n\n15 things you should never say to a Michigander\n\nHow to talk like a Michigander: 17 terms only we understand"
