        "text": "Charlton Heston was an American actor best known for playing historical figures and literary characters. He was critically acclaimed for portraying ‘Moses’ in the epic film ‘The Ten Commandments.’ Heston was honored with the ‘Academy Award’ for ‘Best Actor’ for playing the title character in the historical drama film ‘Ben-Hur.’ He became interested in dramatics at a young age and used to act out characters from popular books. His interest in acting took a serious turn when he auditioned for a high school play and realized that he was meant to be an actor. Naturally bestowed with acting talent, he won a drama scholarship to the ‘Northwestern University.’ After serving in ‘World War II’ for a couple of years, he began to determinedly work on his acting career. He started appearing on Broadway and soon got noticed for his acting skills as well as his well-built physique and chiseled features. After entering Hollywood, it did not take him long to establish himself as a popular character actor. The resounding success of ‘Ben-Hur’ earned him the reputation of being one of the best historical character actors in Hollywood. Apart from being an actor, he was also a political activist who campaigned for the cause of civil rights with Martin Luther King."
