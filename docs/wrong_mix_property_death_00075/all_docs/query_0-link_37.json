        "text": "Actor Born John Charles Carter on Oct. 4, 1923 in Evanston, Ill.\n\nCharlton Heston was an Oscar-winning actor who achieved stardom playing larger-than-life figures including Moses, Michelangelo and Andrew Jackson, and went on to become an unapologetic gun advocate and darling of conservative causes.\n\nWith a booming baritone voice, the tall, ruggedly handsome actor delivered his signature role as the prophet Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 Biblical extravaganza \"The Ten Commandments,\" raising a rod over his head as God miraculously parts the Red Sea.\n\nHeston won the Academy Award for lead actor in another religious blockbuster, 1959's \"Ben-Hur,\" racing four white horses at top speed in one of the cinema's legendary action sequences: the 15-minute chariot race in which his character, a proud and noble Jew, competes against his childhood Roman friend.\n\nLike the chariot race and the bearded prophet Moses, Heston will be best remembered for several indelible cinematic moments: playing a deadly game of cat and mouse with Orson Welles in the oil fields in \"Touch of Evil,\" his rant at the end of \"Planet of the Apes\" when he sees the destruction of the Statue of Liberty, his discovery that \"Soylent Green is people!\" in the sci-fi hit \"Soylent Green\" and the dead Spanish hero on his steed in \"El Cid.\"\n\nHeston also was blessed by working with legendary directors such as DeMille in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" and again in \"The Ten Commandments,\" Welles in \"Touch of Evil,\" Sam Peckinpah in \"Major Dundee,\" William Wyler in \"The Big Country\" and \"Ben-Hur,\" George Stevens in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\" Franklin Schaffner in \"The War Lord\" and \"Planet of the Apes,\" and Anthony Mann in \"El Cid.\"\n\nLate in life, Heston's stature as a political firebrand overshadowed his acting. He became demonized by gun-control advocates and liberal Hollywood when he became president of the National Rifle Assn. in 1998."
