        "text": "Walter Seltzer, Veteran Hollywood Producer, Dies at 96\n\nWalter Seltzer, a Hollywood press agent turned producer, died at the Motion Picture and Television Fund's retirement home, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He was 96. Born in Philadelphia, Seltzer moved to Hollywood in 1935, where he got a job with Fox West Coast Theatres.

We think \"Henry Gale\" and Co. are one-time Dharma Initiative members gone rogue. Now they are committed to stopping the Initiative's crazy testing and they need strong-willed Jack, Kate and Sawyer to help them. The Dharma InitiativeSo the Initiative —&nbsp;with all its testing in meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology and electromagnetism —&nbsp;is evil? Hell, yeah. Polar bears in the tropics, a phoenix rising and human guinea pigs — this can't be good. Widmore L"
