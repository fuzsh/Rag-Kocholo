        "text": "The Newcastle Knights are a professional club competing in the National Rugby League. Based in the city of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, they play home games at Newcastle Stadium.\n\nThe Knights joined the NSWRL competition in 1988 alongside the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast-Tweed Giants, marking the first time Newcastle was represented in the competition since the Newcastle Rebels departed in 1909. Newcastle won their first premiership in the 1997 ARL season against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles - considered one of the greatest Grand Finals of all time. They won a second premiership against the Parramatta Eels in the 2001 NRL Grand Final."
