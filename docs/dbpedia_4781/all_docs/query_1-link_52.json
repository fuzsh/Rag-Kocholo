        "text": "The Auchmuty Library’s greatest benefactor was Miss Reta Light (1898 – 1989), who, upon her death in September 1989 left the Library a staggering $1.5 million.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter, and the last survivor of the Light family of Newcastle, leaving an immense legacy to the City.\n\nThe Light family’s love for the City of Newcastle was displayed in a series of acts of public service and achievements of lasting value such as the creation of the majestic Newcastle Town Hall, the beautiful Civic Theatre and the electrification of the Newcastle to Sydney train link as well as this immense gift to the University’s library.\n\nThe Light Memorial Trust was formed to administer the endowment.\n\nAccording to her will, the money was to be used to purchase books, periodicals, microfilms and musical scores.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1999 the Trust financed $597,172 worth of acquisitions including a fine collection of Australian poetry, rare first editions of works by James Joyce and Thomas Hardy and impressive editions of Le Corbusier and titles related to the history of theatre.\n\nIt has continued to fund library purchases to this day including the beautiful Newcastle engravings and maps that have dazzled the community.\n\nThe Light Family’s Enduring Legacy to the City of Newcastle and its People\n\nThe Light family’s enduring legacy is the bringing of beautiful things to Newcastle and its people, as a gift back to the City that had given their family safe refuge and enabled them to grow and prosper.\n\nReta’s father, Morris Light, a migrant, and by today’s reckoning a “refugee” escaping Jewish persecution in Russia, set up a store in Newcastle known as the “House of Lights”, so people could purchase things for their home, without losing their home to finance it.\n\nOnce he entered public service as alderman, and then Mayor, he again sought bringing beautiful things to Newcastle in the form of its new Newcastle Town Hall and Civic Theatre.\n\nHe was inspired by his 1923 visit to Durban in South Africa, where he saw their Town Hall and Civic complex of theatre, library, museum and art gallery, and said to himself, Newcastle deserves all this.\n\nHe never lived to see his new Town Hall, having died just months before its opening in 1929.\n\nHowever, he is immortalised in the Lights Lamp Standard at the base of the stairs leading up to the former Newcastle Town Hall.\n\nIncidentally, Morris Light’s tombstone, now part of the the Light Family Crypt at Sandgate Cemetery was designed by the same architect who designed the Newcastle Town Hall, Henry E. White.\n\nOne thing Morris didn’t manage to anticipate bringing home, from the world, and which was missing from the City of Newcastle, was a University!\n\nEducation was very dear to this family. The only member of the Light Family to reach a tertiary education was Reta’s eldest sister, Hilda.\n\nHilda Vera Light was a lover of the arts, her favourite poet was John Keats, and she was the youngest person in the state of New South Wales to achieve a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. She proudly displayed the initials “B.A.” after her name in numerous articles penned for the Newcastle Morning Herald. She was a champion of women’s rights, equity, the Labour movement, had traveled the world, sailed the Nile with the Nubians, escaped Chinese bandits, and Nazis and had met Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe late William (Bill) Claridge, author of the Pommy Town Years, was only a young boy when he came out with his family from Bristol to settle in Newcastle in 1921. He said that when he had heard that his family were moving out here, he darted to his local public library and discovered all he could about Newcastle.\n\nWhen he arrived here,what struck him was the physical poverty of the children in his classroom, they had no shoes. But what was worse, was that there were no public libraries here. He knew more about Newcastle than the people who were living here. Physical poverty is easy to fix, a couple of bucks can buy a kid a new set of shoes, but poverty of mind is much harder, and takes years and years and generations to remedy.\n\nIt is very interesting that Hilda (Reta’s eldest sister) appears to have taken steps to have one established in 1935:\n\n“Miss Hilda Light has advised the Newcastle City Council that during her tour of the United States of America she intends to Interview the Carnegie Trust to urge that a grant should be given to Newcastle for the establishment of a public library.” – MEN AND WOMEN (1935, January 14). The Newcastle Sun (NSW : 1918 – 1954), p. 8. Retrieved August 11, 2022, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article165947715\n\nWe can now begin to better understand why Reta provided her family’s final gift in 1989 to the University Library, to help provide gifts of the memory of the world for the education of its staff and students; to help end the poverty of the mind.\n\nIt is this legacy that inspires us to forever remember Reta and the Light Family, and their contribution to this University and its City. Education as a “guiding light” is an apt metaphor for this family’s enduing commitment to this City and its University.\n\nWho was Reta Light?\n\nReta Light was born on the 15th March 1898 in the family home at Cowper Street, Carrington, New South Wales.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of Morris and Sarah Light.\n\nMorris Light was a well respected businessman and public figure, the founder of the furniture store known as the “House of Lights” and later M. Light & Son, as well as alderman on both the Carrington and Newcastle Councils.\n\nHe served as Mayor of Newcastle from 1924-25 and is credited for having set in motion the self-funding construction of the majestic Newcastle City Hall and beautiful Civic Theatre.\n\nReta was described as talented, shy, self-indulgent yet generous, strong willed and eccentric.\n\nShe loved to travel, spoke fluent French, and divided her time between France and Australia.\n\nBy the age 11, she was hitting the social pages, involved with the Hebrew Debating and Social Club of Newcastle.\n\nBy 19, she was an accomplished musician, performing piano pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius and McDowell with Miss Eileen Beeston at a recital to help raise funds for the 36th Battalion Comforts Fund, a fund devoted to providing Christmas gifts to soldiers fighting on the front lines. A newspaper review of the musical performance held in the Central Hall, Newcastle was published.\n\nBy 1930, she is in Spain with her eldest sister Hilda, visiting a Spanish bullfight, and horrified at the brutality and cruelty of the spectacle. Both rebel rouser sisters were cheering for the bulls!\n\nDuring the second world war, whilst in Paris, Reta was imprisoned by the Nazis in a prisoner of war camp in Vittel, France, while her sister Hilda had fortunately escaped and was protected by nuns. This camp was notorious for ransoming wealthy Jews to their distressed families at home.\n\nBy 1947, both Rita and Hilda are back in Australia, alive and well, and living in Manly N.S.W.\n\nUpon her return, she put her share of the fortune into a range of investments, indulging her passions for fur and opals.\n\nAs an accomplished musician, she often gave recitals on the grand piano at the David Jones cafeteria in Sydney.\n\nShe had a reputation for traveling in grand style, booking out two state rooms on board the ship, one for herself, another for her luggage, (which usually required a lorry to get her to the dock) and the remainder in the hold.\n\nShe never married, had no children, and lived alone.\n\nIn her latter years living in Manly, she would often take the ferry into the city, visit her suppliers of gems and furs, and then drop in at David Jones for some coffee and a recital.\n\nShe would also often travel to Newcastle to visit the family crypt at Sandgate.\n\nIn 1980 she suffered a massive stroke, and never spoke or walked again, spending her final years in the Austral House Nursing Home in Manly.\n\nShe died on the 25 September 1989 aged 91 and lies buried in the family crypt at Sandgate. The death notice stated she was a milliner.\n\nHer gift to the Library took all by surprise, and reinforced the notion that she held Newcastle and its University in high regard for the good fortune that this town and its people had bestowed upon her family.\n\nShe came from a wonderful family that were stars in their own right including her father Morris Light (1859-1929), who in 1887 married Sarah Jacobs, and together had four children, Hilda (1888), Bertram (1889), Myra (1892) and Reta (1898).\n\nReta’s Father: Morris Light (1859 – 1929)\n\nMorris Light’s Birth and Russian Departure\n\nReta Light’s father, Morris Light was born in Kovno, Western Russia in 1859, but left there in 1879 escaping the persecution of the Jews that was gaining momentum during the period.\n\nRussia, at the time was largely a medieval country, where the worlds of church and state were identical and religiously motivated hatreds were brimming under the surface.\n\nRussia was the last absolute monarchy in Europe and had the largest Jewish population, which amounted to 5% of the Russian Empire equating to 1/3 of the Jews in the world.\n\nThese 5 million people lived in the Pale of Jewish settlement, which was a group of provinces extending from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and encompassing much of what is now Poland.\n\nIn 1865, under the regime of Alexander II, the Czar had allowed Jewish artisans to locate outside of the Pale, the government also encouraged the education of Jewish youth into the learned professions, graduates of which were also allowed the same freedoms. These measures opened up new centres of Jewish industry and prosperity.\n\nWith the death of Alexander II, the situation soon decayed, culminating in the anti-Jewish riots of 1881.\n\nThis led to the head of the Ministry of the Interior, General Ignatieff, to issue the infamous ‘May Laws’ on 3rd May 1881 which included restrictions on the ways Jewish people could conduct business and where they could settle.\n\nThe young Morris Light therefore left Russia at an opportune time.\n\nDuring the period from 1879 to 1884, he moved to Scotland and operated a draper’s business in Glasgow.\n\nArrival in Australia, settling in Newcastle\n\nHe later emigrated to New South Wales, Australia in 1884 landing in Sydney with 200 pounds sterling in his pockets.\n\nFrom Sydney he traveled to Mittagong, then Moss Vale and Brisbane before coming to Newcastle in 1887.\n\nAt Wickham he joined the Order of Oddfellows, and became involved with the Wickham School of Arts Debating Society.\n\nHe settled in Carrington and operated a business selling household wares in a horse drawn cart.\n\nIn 1888 he married Sarah Jacobs, a 32 year-old English woman, and the couple had four children, Hilda (1888), Bertram (1889), Myra (1892) and Reta, who was born on the 15th March 1898.\n\nHouse of Lights\n\nDuring the opening years of the new century Morris Light opened his first furniture store in Cowper Street, and then moved to Hunter Street West where it became known as the ‘House of Lights’.\n\nThe enterprise expanded with a new emporium which was later built and a second store opened at Vincent Street, Cessnock.\n\nHis son, Bertram, was groomed to take over the management of the business which became M. Light & Son Ltd.\n\nMorris Light was proud to acknowledge his successful achievement of the introduction of consumer credit to Newcastle, which offered finance to customers under his own interest free terms. The success of the system was reinforced by the claim that they had never found occasion to repossess any of their goods.\n\nCivic Life\n\nHis commitment and service to his local community was also a feature of his cumulative 35 years of public life as alderman for the Carrington and Newcastle Councils.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1903, for thirteen years he served as alderman on Carrington Council, serving two terms as Mayor of Carrington in 1902 and 1903, being credited as being a catalyst for the early electrical illumination of Carrington Streets.\n\nHe also introduced the system of Council purchasing its own horses and drays and sanitary wagons, for the purpose of doing their own work, rather than contracting it out. Other municipalities later followed this example and did the same. He also raised the wages of council employees during his term in office.\n\nIn 1900 he moved from Carrington to Newcastle, and whilst still an alderman on Carrington Council, stood for, and was elected to the Macquarie Ward in Newcastle.\n\nOn the evening of December 10th 1924, while a band outside the Council chambers played “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow”, Morris Light was elected Mayor of Newcastle, an event that was not without controversy.\n\nFor the outgoing Mayor, Alderman R.G. Kilgour, refused to invest the new Mayor with the robes of office. Apparently upset at not being able to secure a seventh year as Mayor, he resigned as a protest against what he termed the “deceit and intrigue” of his colleagues.\n\nMorris Light served as Mayor until December 10th 1925. His achievements included the electrification of the tram service, he was also an advocate of the electrification of the Newcastle to Sydney rail link, the creation of a children’s park at Centennial Park, and he set in motion the construction of the city hall, offices, art gallery and museum.\n\nHe considered his greatest achievement the construction of a self-funded City hall and Civic Theatre complex, a task which involved a battle between Council and the illustrious coal baron Mr John Brown.\n\nMayor Light wanted the coal baron to relinquish possession of the old Black Diamond Hotel site as a ‘gift’ to the people of Newcastle so as “to have a Town Hall befitting the prestige of the city”.\n\nThe coal baron didn’t agree, and suggested they site the Town Hall at the congested eastern end of the City, as well as affirming that he would resist every move to resume the site proposed by Mayor Light.\n\nAs history would have it, Morris Light died of pneumonia at 7.10 am on the 26th July 1929, aged 74 years. His funeral at Sandgate cemetery was attended by 300 people and involved a joint Jewish and Masonic ceremony. He never lived to see his dream of the City Hall and Civic Theatre finally completed.\n\nAt the opening of the new Town Hall Alderman Wheeler gave credit to his predecessor for the new building, the lights outside bear a commemorative plaque to honour Morris Light’s contribution. These buildings stand as treasures to the city of Newcastle and highlight the magnificent achievement that people of vision can have on a place.\n\nThe new Town Hall was opened at 2:30pm on Saturday 14th December 1929 by the Governor, Sir Dudley de Chair. The event was documented by the Newcastle Sun:\n\nOn the arrival of the Governor (at 12:40pm), the Mayor (Alderman Wheeler), welcomed him.\n\nThe Governor then inspected the Boy Scout guard of honor.\n\nAt the foot of the Town Hall steps the Governor unveiled the two bronze lamp standards which were erected in honour of the late Alderman Morris Light, who was the “founder” of the Civic Centre.\n\nOne lamp standard was covered with a Union Jack and the other with an Australian Flag.\n\nOn behalf of the relatives of the late Alderman M. Light, Alderman Bert Light, who succeeded his late father to the City Council, thanked the Governor for unveiling the memorial.\n\nIt was a matter of great sorrow to them that his father had not been spared, Alderman Light said, to be present with his fellow citizens on this occasion, which was of very great special moment in the history of his adopted city.\n\nThe Governor shook hands with the widow of the late Alderman Light.\n\nThen he walked up the Town Hall steps and opened the door at the main entrance, and returned to the top of the steps and gave his address.\n\n– Enthusiastic Scenes at Opening of New Town Hall (1929, December 14).

M. LIGHT\n\nMonument Consecrated\n\nCEREMONY AT SANDGATE\n\nA monument to the memory of the late Ald. Morris Light, a former Mayor of Newcastle, was consecrated by the Rev. Rabbi I. Morris, of the Newcastle Synagogue, in the Jewish, portion of the Sandgate General Cemetery, yesterday afternoon.There was a representative assembly of citizens. The Rev. Rabbi Morris conducted the special consecration service, including psalms and prayers appropriate for the occasion, and in the course of his remarks eulogised the late Ald. Light for his many good qualities as a citizen of high standing. The monument was artistically draped with many beautiful floral tributes. Along those who attended were Mrs. M. Light. sen., Ald. and Mrs. B. Light, and Miss Myra Light.\n\nIn addressing the assemblage, Rabbi Morris said they had gathered in that consecrated spot to recall the memory of their departed brother, Ald. Morris Light, and to dedicate the monument as a token of their respect and love.\n\n“Many months have pasted since he was summoned from this earthly life,” continued the Rabbi, “but his memory continues a living force in our lives. We are grateful to the Most High for the indomitable courage wherewith he confronted life with all its difficulties for the nobility of his inspiration the splendour of his vision, and for the high purpose to which he dedicated his life. For a number of years he was alderman and mayor of Carrington and Newcastle, and his life was a full and worthy one. He worked untiringly and self-sacrificingly, and was devoted to his duties, of which he had the highest conception. His word was his bond: his thoughts were pure, and his actions noble. He was a man of character, of knowledge, and strength of will. His wholehearted devotion to the cause of civic life, and his active services for the welfare of the citizens of Newcastle earned for him the deep gratitude of the community, and his name will long be recalled with respect and admiration. Due to his untiring efforts, he was instrumental in the building of he Newcastle Town Hall, which will always remain as an everlasting memorial to his wholehearted devotion as a citizen of our beloved city. We thanks God for all that was true and good in the life of our beloved brother; for the sweet and inspiring memory that he has left behind. Righteousness is mightier than the grave. Our good deeds survive. Though the body has returned to earth, the soul abides with the Most High for ever. Morris Light was a man of sincerity – public-spirited, broadminded, benevolently inspired, and responsive to all appeals for worthy and charitable causes. He commanded the admiration of all associated with him. It must indeed be a comfort to his bereaved family; it must be a source of solemn pride to his grief-stricken wife and children, to tell that their loved one has departed this life with the imperishable crown of a good name, and his memory shall never fade from the hearts of his sorrowing relatives, friends and numerous acquaintances.\n\n“We have cheerful consciousness that there is still a link of love and respect that will continue to bind us with our departed friend.” concluded the reverend speaker. “We will leave him in peace. With respect we bid him farewell; and thus thinking of him, let us go in quietness of spirit and live in peace and charity with all mankind.”\n\nAld. Morris Light died in Newcastle on July 26, 1929.\n\nThe monument was specially designed by Mr. Henry White, of Sydney, from whose plans the Newcastle Town Hall and Civic buildings were erected. It is of simple character. The headstone consists of a block of Uralla granite, weighing one ton. The paving and kerbs are also in granite, harmonising with the monument marking the last resting place of a fellow citizen, whose energies were for upwards of 40 years devoted to the advancement of the city of his adoption.\n\n– LATE ALD.
