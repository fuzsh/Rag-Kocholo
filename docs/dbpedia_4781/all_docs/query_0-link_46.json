        "text": "RUGBY league and the mining industry have been intrinsically linked since the game was first played in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley Coalfields in the first years of last century.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nSo it was only natural for the NSW Minerals Council and the Knights to announce an official partnership yesterday at Coal and Allied’s Mount Thorley Warkworth mine near Singleton.\n\nThe Knights will wear a NSW Mining logo on their jersey for the rest of the season, starting with their game against defending NRL premiers Melbourne at Hunter Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThousands of miners and their nearest and dearest are expected to swell the home crowd as part of the ‘‘Voice for Mining Family Day’’.\n\nSome 5000 tickets will be given to mining workers, who will be encouraged to turn up in their ‘‘high vis’’.\n\nOnce-A-Knight Old Boys Bill Peden, Adam Muir, Stephen Crowe and Adam Woolnough, who have worked or now work in the mining industry, joined 30 colleagues for a barbecue yesterday to officially launch the promotion.\n\n‘‘Is there a more natural fit than coalmining and rugby league? That’s how it started in the north of England, and the same culture has been transferred to Australia, and more particularly Newcastle and the Hunter Valley,’’ Crowe said.\n\n‘‘Without the mining industry, our own families and personal history wouldn’t be what they are, and every single week that the team runs out, Hunter Stadium is still full of people from the mining industry that supports us.’’\n\nLike so many of those who went before him, Crowe was a miner during the week and played rugby league on the weekends for most of his career.\n\n‘‘Whether it’s the players, their fathers ... or the crowd on the hill, rugby league and the Knights have always attracted people from the mining industry in all its forms,’’ Crowe said.\n\n‘‘I think the effect of the mining industry across the entire region is underestimated.\n\n‘‘So when the industry has a bit of a downturn, the effect on the region is more significant than most people realise and that affects our supporter base, so if the Knights can lend a hand in any way, we’re all more than keen to help out.’’\n\nIn his 1998 yearbook, league historian David Middleton explained the Newcastle Rugby League started its own four-team competition in 1910 due partly to ‘‘an industrial upheaval in the mining industry’’ and to break away from the established rugby union.\n\nThe Newcastle ‘‘Rebels’’ had played in the Sydney rugby league premiership in 1908 and 1909.\n\n‘‘A large number of players were employed in Hunter district coalmines and widespread resentment was generated against officials of the [Rugby] Union, many of whom were also associated in the ownership of local mines, where free labour had been introduced,’’ Middleton wrote.\n\n‘‘This practice angered the miners, who took exception to playing Rugby Union under the banner of their industrial enemies.’’\n\nPremiership-winning captains Paul Harragon and Andrew Johns are coalminers’ sons.\n\nCoal and Allied were the Knights’ major sponsors before Nathan Tinkler, who made his fortune in the mining industry, took the reins.\n\nCurrent skipper Kurt Gidley’s father, Geoff, drove coal trains, and now Peden, Muir and Woolnough are among a host of former Knights earning a crust underground.\n\n‘‘I grew up in my Dad’s pub at Cessnock, and more often than not the pub was full of blokes who worked in the mines, so I grew up around those blokes. It’s funny now how after growing up in that environment and playing footy, I’ve ended up as a coalminer.’’\n\n‘‘I’m proud that the Knights are getting behind this show of support for Hunter mining workers and their families on game day.’’\n\nNewcastle Knights Old Boys at Coal and Allied Mount Thorley Warkworth Mine for the launch of their sponsorship on Tuesday.
