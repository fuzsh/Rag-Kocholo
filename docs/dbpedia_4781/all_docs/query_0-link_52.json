(York Pageant, Newscuttings Book, York Archives, ref: PAG)\n\nPageant outline\n\nNarrative Chorus I. Hail, Hope, bright bringer of the Years\n\nThe setting is a glade in a forest with a primitive hut in the background. The heralds sound a summons and the narrative chorus enters. One section of the chorus sings as 'Memory' and the other as 'Hope'. Memory leads the singing and Hope responds:\n\nHail thou, too, mystic memory! but say\n\nWhat cause or call hath summoned these again,\n\nSo silver,\n\nFrom their aeonian sleep\n\nBeneath the buried silt of centuries.\n\nIndividual 'semi-choruses' from each section then sing short pieces in the same vein until both sections come together to sing an introduction to the pageant, which ends:\n\nWhere York-towers up-stand today\n\nBy the winding Ouse\n\nBut stay!\n\nNow upon the greensward near\n\nThe long-vanished forms appear!\n\n(York Pageant July 26th to 31st 1909: Book of Words, 5-6. Unless otherwise indicated, all information and quotation is derived from the book of words.)\n\nEpisode I. Caer Ebrauc, BC 800\n\nA family enter the arena one by one. The men of the family have been hunting in the forest; the eldest son produces a dead bird and a younger son brings a fish he has caught. Grandparents enter and all regard the grandfather with great reverence when he speaks. The family go about the day’s business with the men attending to their bows, flint arrowheads and spears. The mother sets the eldest daughter of the family to housework and sends a younger girl into the forest to gather herbs. The mood is light-hearted. A hunter then enters, saying that he has come to barter for arrowheads. Slightly quarrelsome bartering takes place between the father and the hunter, but no conclusion is reached. As the hunter turns to go, he sees the eldest daughter emerge from the hut. He asks to marry her but the father declines to allow this and the two eldest sons behave threateningly towards the hunter. At length, a bargain is struck; the father permits a marriage between his eldest daughter and the hunter if his sons can marry the hunter's two sisters. All are joyous at this decision and determine that they will now be one tribe.\n\nNarrative Chorus II. Eight Centuries Onward\n\nThe narrative chorus sings of the arrival of the Romans and is disparaging about them and about the role of Queen Cartismandua:\n\nA British Queen for love of power or pelf\n\nFalse to her country's cause, her country's son!\n\nThe chorus ends with kinder words about the Emperor Constantine.\n\nEpisode II: Altera Roma\n\nScene I, AD 53\n\nThe hut is removed from the pageant arena and replaced with a stone high-seat. The scene 'deals with the treachery of Queen Cartismandua [Cartimandua], the betrayal of Caradoc, and the compact between Cartismandua and the Roman—Ostorius Scapula'. It begins with Cartismandua seated on the throne; she receives homage from several princes but Venusius refuses to bow to her. The queen attempts to persuade the attendant crowds that they must throw in their lot with Rome, but Venusius calls for war and the crowds support him. Boduoc takes the queen’s side; a fight takes place between him and Venusius in which the latter triumphs, thus strengthening his cause. Caradoc then arrives exhausted from battle with the Romans; he is greeted cordially by the queen who pretends to accede to the wishes of the people and asks him to rest before returning to the fight, this time alongside Venusius. The Romans then appear led by Scapula. The queen allows Caradoc to be taken prisoner by the Romans; Caradoc wakes to find himself in shackles. A druid priest—Abaris—challenges the queen but she does not yield. Venusius threatens to overthrow her and declare himself overlord; but Cartismandua counters this by stating she will take his sisters (Aska and Ailaedia) as hostages. Abaris detains Venusius stating that he must stay his wrath meantime. All the main characters exit the stage separately.\n\nScene II. AD 78-89\n\nBritons discuss the imminent arrival of Agricola and the Ninth Legion; they flee to their altar as the Romans appear. The Romans are weary from battle and decide to set camp at the village; Agricola orders his officer Amicus to barter with the natives for food. Amicus returns and states the natives are friendly. Agricola asks to speak with their representative. Bran comes forward and Agricola asks the name of their village: Bran states that it has no name. Agricola insists on knowing and the Britons as one call out the name of Caer Ebrauc. Agricola takes advice and determines the place will henceforth be called Eburacum. The natives accept this reluctantly.\n\nScene III. AD 117-120\n\nMembers of the Ninth Legion bemoan being stationed in Britain; they are homesick for Rome. The Sixth Legion arrives. The leaders of the Sixth are surprised by the primitive camp which has no baths. A trumpet sounds and Adrianus [Hadrian] enters accompanied by soldiers, nobles and ladies. The 'natives' stare on the scene with awe. Adrianus orders the building of forts, great walls and towers—including ‘A tower facing many ways, that whencever the barbarians come, you may hurl arrows at them'. He calls for priests and orders that altars are built to the Roman gods, but also to Egyptian and Persian deities. He enquires about local gods and is told there are many; further altars are ordered. Adrianus goes on to dictate that comforts such as baths and a theatre must be provided. Adrianus and his men depart leaving the court behind. One member of the Ninth orders the Britons to begin building and refers to them as slaves. The Britons are angry and the Roman ladies become afraid. The ladies are then persuaded to perform a Roman dance; this closes the scene.\n\nScene IV. AD 206\n\nThe emperor Septimius Severus arrives leaning on Papinianus; his sons Geta and Caracalla follow. Septimius states he wishes to make progress with the history of his life that he has been writing, but ill health impedes this. He comments on his sons stating, 'Geta is gentle... But Caracalla is a wolf!' Septimius begins to write as Papinianus retires. Geta then leaves to watch some games in which the soldiers are engaged, and is greeted heartily by all. Caracalla remains with his father and is resentful that the soldiers hold Geta in such affection; he is eager to be emperor. Caracalla steals up behind his father and makes to strike him with his sword, but Septimius is alert to this move and grabs his wrist. Caracalla tries to make light of his actions but his father calls for Papinianus and tells him that his son has tried to kill him. Septimius, distressed, takes out a phial of poison but is prevented from swallowing its contents by Papinianus. He then announces that he will travel on to the north and leave government in the hands of his sons. The soldiers show favouritism towards Geta and Caracalla's jealousy is given full vent when he attempts to destroy a statue of his brother. Septimius returns and it is announced that he is dying; Geta runs to be with his father who bids him perform the last rites (to close his eyes and place a coin in his mouth) before he dies. Geta does this and prepares for his father's funeral, but Caracalla and his allies leave immediately for Rome. The scene ends with the funeral procession.\n\nScene V. AD 294\n\nWomen are chatting excitedly at the riverside; they are first to see the arrival of Carausius by ship. They call out 'Woe! Woe! The Pirate!' Britons and Romans respond and rush to arms but are easily overpowered by Carausius and his men, including his associate Alectus. Carausius declares that 'Rome grows weak. She is tottering to her fall. Wherefore here and now, I seize the sovereignty'. Carausius is hailed as emperor. Alectus demands his reward and is dismissed contemptuously by Carausius. Alectus responds by stabbing Carausius and declaring himself emperor. A messenger enters stating that Constantius Chlorus is on his way. Alectus and the soldiers depart. The Britons discuss the situation; it is of no interest to them who rules from Rome. A messenger returns from the battle stating that both Alectus and Constantius Chlorus are dead. The new ruler is Constantius' son—Constantinus—whose mother was a Briton. The Britons are surprised and happy that they will now be ruled by one of their own kind. The scene ends with the arrival of Constantinus.\n\nScene VI. AD 306\n\nConstantinus enters in pomp, accompanied by a large company of attendants including senators and magistrates, nobles, ladies, dancers, and also some captives in chains. The procession approaches an altar where priests wait. Constantinus calls for thanks to be given for the recent victory; a 'Hymn to Apollo' is sung. Then a 'lowly and humble' procession approaches; in this are the bishop Eborius and two attendants—they chant the 23rd Psalm. A Roman priest calls for the Christians to be slain but Constantinus denies this and asks to hear more about the 'God of Love' from Eborius. All then exit.\n\nNarrative Chorus III: Where are the old God's altars?\n\nA chorus is sung which rejoices in the arrival of Christianity to Britain.\n\nEpisode III. Eoferwic—Storm and Stress, AD 617-937\n\nScene I, AD 617\n\nThe 'folk of Eoferwic' bend 'to their daily toil'; the people are troubled and afraid. Joyous singing is then heard and a company of young men and women in Roman dress arrive. These youths are former captives sent to Rome as children; their parents recognize them with delight. The youths tell their story and that they were converted to the new religion while waiting to be sold into slavery. They speak of Paulinus and Queen Ethelburga, saying that the queen is also a Christian but her husband King Edwin has still to follow her. A small group of the 'Angles' then point into the distance where a company are seen approaching. The scene ends with the arrival of King Edwin, Queen Ethelburga and Paulinus.\n\nScene II. AD 627\n\nEdwin awaits the arrival of Queen Ethelburga and Paulinus; with him is Coifi the high priest of Woden. The queen greets Edwin and bemoans that he has not yet converted to Christianity. Paulinus greets some of the Christian youths who appeared in scene I. The king asks for more advice and Paulinus reminds him of his dream in which 'Thou wast sitting alone, in sorrow, in danger of thy life; and one came to thee in the night and foretold thy crowning and said. \"When all these things have come to pass and my servant comes to show thee the true way, remember the token—\" Dost though remember the token?' Edwin is aghast that Paulinus knows of this dream; Paulinus touches the king's head and it is clear that this is the awaited token. Edwin is immediately converted. Coifi also agrees to convert and smashes the heathen idols. The scene ends with Edwin stating he will build a church and Paulinus saying he will perform baptisms. One of the queen's ladies steps forward to be baptized; she gives her name as Hild.\n\nScene III. AD 635\n\nAidan enters with some monks, among them Colman. Aidan proclaims they are newly arrived from Iona and on their way to Lindisfarne. They enter a church to worship. Time then moves on to AD 663. King Oswy, Hild, Aelflead [Ælfflæd] arrive alongside monks and nuns; Colman comes out of the church to meet them. Eanflead, Agilbert, and Wilfrid also arrive. Colman greets them in turn. They discuss the date for Easter, which is disputed. Colman disagrees with Wilfrid who argues for the Roman calendar. Colman says he will leave for Ireland and set up a monastery there, since he cannot agree with what is proposed. Oswy states that they will meet the following year at Whitby to 'take counsel'; Hild agrees. The scene ends with a nun singing a hymn in praise of Hild.\n\nScene IV. AD 737\n\nKing Eadbert enters accompanied by nobles and 'war-men'; a cheering crowd follows them. Then comes Archbishop Ecgbert together with priests and acolytes among whom is Alcuin. Ecgbert welcomes the king who states that he will build a great church in thanks for victories, but after this, he wishes to enter the monastery as monk for he tires of the burdens on kingship. A disturbance breaks out among the crowd: two men are fighting over a debt. Ecgbert is called on to settle the dispute but he uses the affray to demonstrate to the king the level of ignorance at large. The king suggests he opens a school; the archbishop agrees. The acolytes are appointed the first pupils and Alcuin is singled out as one who has particular promise. The king gives the school its motto: 'Disce ut doceas' [learn that you may teach] and Ecgbert describes the learning to be delivered in the School of St Peter as 'the seven liberal arts: Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic, Music and Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy—all to lead you to the knowledge of God'. All the main characters exit while the crowd remains.\n\nScene V. AD 793\n\nAssembled citizens see a priest approaching; when he arrives, he tells them all to arm themselves for 'the sea is black with strange craft!' All begin to gather weapons when King Ethelred and an army arrive. Time moves forward to AD 867, at which point the Danes led by Ingvar [Ívarr] burst in and there is a 'sharp fight'. Ingvar announces that 'all this land is ours... But cease not from slaying until Deira be desolate, her God forgotten and our Gods throned in his place'. The scene ends with Anlaf, Udgrim, Ulfkil, Hardulf and Beowulf entering from the other side of the arena.\n\nScene VI. AD 937\n\nA character also named Ingvar announces that Athelstan must be overthrown. He calls for a combined army of Welsh, 'Scots and all men of the north' to defeat him. A messenger announces that Athelstan and a great army is approaching Brunanburgh. People arrive: all have suffered from the war. Archbishop Wulfstan announces that Athelstan has won the battle. A minstrel steps forward and speaks in verse about the victory while Athelstan accompanied by Edmund the Atheling, Eric Blodax and his court, 'warmen' and Danish prisoners enter the arena. The king presents gifts to the archbishop and states that he will found a hospital in 'honour of St Peter'. He further decrees that Blodax will be overlord in Northumbria while he goes to Wessex to carry on the fight. The people cheer and hail him as 'King of all the English'.\n\nNarrative Chorus IV. Whom have we here?\n\nThe choir sings a song about the coming of the Normans.\n\nEpisode IV. Iorwic—An End and a Beginning\n\nScene I. AD 1041\n\nSiward [earl of Northumbria] enters, accompanied by his son Waltheof and a crowd of retainers. Siward tells his son he is grievously ill and comments on the irony of this, since he has survived many battles. He calls for a monastery to be built at Galmanho. Siward mentions with pride that he killed Macbeth in revenge for Duncan's death. He calls on his nobles to dress him in his armour and weaponry, and to place him in a high chair. A procession of women enters and he tells them to sing the 'Lyke-Wake Dirge'. Siward dies and is carried off by his nobles still seated in the chair.\n\nScene II. AD 1050-1066\n\nTostig, earl of Northumbria, enters with his nobles. Gamul (son of Orm) and Ulf (son of Dolfin) are brought before him in chains. Gamul remains silent but Ulf is defiant and calls Tostig a 'Black-hearted Earl'. The two are dragged off to their execution. A messenger arrives and tells Tostig that the thegns of Northumbria demand the release of Gamul and Ulf, but Tostig holds fast to his decision to have them killed. Gamul's wife Githa enters and curses Tostig; infuriated, he demands her death. His men-at-arms are reluctant but under his continuing rage, they give in.\n\nAs the soldiers take Githa away, they are distracted by a bugle call heralding the arrival of Morcar who demands that Tostig give up the earldom. Morcar states that he will be earl and he has the support of Tostig's brother—King Harold—for his sister is Harold's wife. Tostig disavows his brother and states his support for 'another Harold' (Harold Hadrada of Norway). The two rivals then rally support from the assembly of nobles and go off to prepare for battle. Citizens of York rush into the arena to greet the arrival of Harold and his wife Aldwyth, who appear in the company of Aldred, Archbishop of York. The people are ecstatic. Harold learns of his brother's treachery and that 'Malcolm of Scotland, and the earls of Orkney, Iceland and Ireland' have given support to Tostig but that Morcar has remained loyal. Aldwyth and Aldred depart and Harold prepares to leave for Stamford Bridge. Before he exits, Tostig enters accompanied by Harold Hadrada, who does not recognise King Harold. The king tries to make peace with his brother Tostig but is rebuffed. Harold leaves to prepare for battle. Hadrada and Tostig converse briefly before also taking leave.\n\nAldwyth and Aldred re-enter accompanied by the queen's ladies. Shouting is heard and as this draws nearer, cries of 'Harold' become clear. Citizens rush back into the arena having learned of Harold's victory. Harold and Morcar return in triumph and the people hail him 'saviour of England!' Aldwyth orders a banquet. A minstrel sings a song in praise of Harold and in defiance of William of Normandy; the entire company join with the last verse:\n\nSo shall we welcome thee,\n\nWilliam of Normandy,\n\nFinger on bow-string, and jav'lin in hand!\n\nFor thee shall war-horn sing,\n\nFalchion on falchion ring,\n\nSo shall we hail thee king\n\nOver our land!\n\nMocking toasts are made to William, but these are interrupted when a thegn from Pevensey rushes in with the news that William has landed and has set up camp in Sussex. Preparations are made at once and Aldwyth begs her husband to take her with him, but he asks her to remain in York with his friend Vebba. Following the king's departure, Aldwyth determines she will follow him; her ladies try to dissuade her, but she is determined. She leaves on horseback accompanied by Vebba.\n\nScene III. AD 1069\n\nA group of citizens are gathered; they complain about their Norman overlords. The Normans—Robert Fitz-Richard, Gilbert of Ghent, William Malet (Sheriff of York) and soldiers—arrive on the scene. The citizens continue complaining loudly and calling out that Edgar is their king; Fitz-Richard orders 'silence the dogs!', but Malet restrains him. The wrangling becomes more heated. Waermund arrives with the news that a Norman earl has been slain in Durham and Edgar is on the march. The citizens fall upon the Normans and Fitz-Herbert is killed. Disquiet follows this as the York citizens realise that revenge will be forthcoming; Gilbert declaims 'know ye not William's anger?' The citizens fall back at this, and William Fitzosbern then arrives with more soldiers. William has heard of the uprising and is on his way to York, but so too is Edgar. To discourage Edgar's troops from finding shelter in York, Malet orders the Norman soldiers to set fire to houses on the edge of the city, but the wind blows the flames into the centre and the Minster catches fire. The archbishop (Ealdred) dies from shock. Edgar arrives at York in the company of Waltheof, Gospatric, Archil and a company of Danish and Scottish soldiers. The city attempts to defend itself against the Normans but in vain; William enters York in the company of Malet, Fitzosbern, Gilbert, Thomas of Bayeux and Eudo Dapifer. William addresses his men, beginning his speech with the oath often associated with him:\n\nBy the splendour of God! I will not leave one of my enemies alive! This nest of rebellion shall be utterly wiped off the face of the earth... You men! Wreak your will on the city. Burn, harry, slay! Let loose your vengeance. Cry havoc!\n\nThe men rush off and William calls for a feast since it is 'Christmastide'. Prisoners are brought in while the nobles dine: among them is Waltheof. All are aghast as Waltheof switches sides and offers his allegiance to William. The king agrees to this and states that he will marry his niece Judith. As William continues to speak of vengeance an officer rushes in. William enquires of him if Beverley has been destroyed as he ordered, to which the officer replies that when they entered the town their captain's horse stumbled and this prevented them from continuing. William is nonplussed by this explanation until it is revealed that that Captain broke his neck and was found with his face turned 'quite backward'. This is judged to be a sign that the patron saint of Beverley (St John) had intervened to save the town. The scene ends with William sparing Beverley and declaring that St Peter in York had also been 'badly used'. Referring to the destruction of the Minster, William appoints Thomas as archbishop and takes leave to examine the damage done to the church.\n\nNarrative Chorus V. For law and justice\n\nThe choir sings an introduction to episode V mentioning the laxity that developed in religious observance as the church grew richer under royal patronage.\n\nEpisode V. York in Civic Power and Splendour\n\nScene I. AD 1132\n\nThis scene covers 'an event that stands unique in the annals of Monasticism, the dissatisfaction of some of the brethren at St Mary's Abbey and their ultimate revolt, and their founding of the famous Cistercian Abbey of Fountains'. The scene opens with monks at sport. Prior Richard takes exception to their behaviour and asks them to stop. The monks respond by calling him a 'spoil-sport'. Richard appeals to the Lord Abbot—Savaricus—but he is dismissive of Richard's complaints. Richard then reveals that he has approached the Archbishop with his worries about the worldliness at large in the abbey. Archbishop Thurstan arrives with supporters and initially he is refused entrance. The scene ends with the archbishop, in anger, declaring St Mary's closed.\n\nScene II. AD 1138\n\nA large gathering of nobles takes place in advance of the Battle of the Standard; this includes William le Gros, Robert de Bruce and Roger de Mowbray. Archbishop Thurstan arrives on a litter with his retinue. The archbishop addresses those assembled saying:\n\nScene III. AD 1142\n\nSix girls enter; they discuss a tournament that is to take place involving the earls of Albermarle and Richmond. They discuss the event excitedly. The earls' esquires and the Mayor of York enter; the girls crowd round hoping to hear more of the coming dual but are chased off. A messenger runs in announcing that King Stephen is on his way. The king arrives in a litter and is in an irritable mood. The earls come before the king and he demands that they make peace. The king calls for the archbishop to come forward and Murdac appears. Stephen denies that this disputed candidate is archbishop and states his preference for William Fitzherbert. The king dismisses Murdac then leaves, reminding the earls that he wishes to hear 'no more of your wranglings'.\n\nTime moves forward to 1154 and a crowd wait for the arrival of Archbishop William of York [William Fitzherbert] who has been away on a journey. A woman tells of a miracle she has just witnessed where a bridge over the Ouse collapsed throwing hundreds of well-wishers who were waiting to greet the Archbishop, into the river. In the account, William prayed for their deliverance and all were saved. The crowd declare this a miracle. William and an entourage of priests and acolytes arrive; children strew flowers before him. William is grateful but asks for the prayers of all, since he sees that soon he must 'cross that river where no man crosses twice'. William beckons the children into the church to 'give thanks' and they crowd around him. Some men lay down a strip of fine cloth for the archbishop to walk on. He is reluctant but finally agrees saying that afterwards it should be sold and the money used to feed the poor. All exit the arena.\n\nScene IV. AD 1190\n\nThe mayor and his wife are in conversation: the wife is anxious for the safety of the Jews and states that there is no archbishop to intercede, but the mayor states that the sheriff, John de Marshall, has the matter in hand. They go out and some Jews enter. They are carrying 'bundles of treasure and are in mortal fear'. They find shelter and try to hide their hoards. An injured man named Levi rushes in, reporting that a mob cries 'death to the Jews!' All look to a rabbi for counsel and decide to take their own lives, but first they set fire to their possessions. The leaders of the mob come on the scene; the chief of these is Sir Richard de Malabey; the mayor and the sheriff are with them trying to calm the violence but to no avail. A 'great song' is heard and the mob stops to listen; as the song dies away, the mob leaders go into the tower and the sheriff calls out 'O horror!' The scene ends with the mayor being led away by his wife and dreading what will happen when the king hears of this.\n\nScene V. AD 1319\n\nA throne is set up and Nicholas Fleming, the Mayor of York enters with two bailiffs. A cart then trundles onto the arena, guarded by soldiers. The mayor reveals that it carries the state papers of England, and a bailiff remarks that this must mean York is a safe city. Edward II enters leaning on his favourite, Hugh le Despenser. With them are Thomas Plantagenet (earl of Lancaster), Lord Segrave, Lord Badlesmere, the earl of Pembroke, earl of Richmond, earl of Hereford and Sir Edward Darel. The king fawns over Despenser. Queen Isabella arrives with her ladies and a number of clergymen including the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Ely, the abbot of St Mary's and the abbot of Selby. The king tries to avoid the queen but she interrupts him and complains of his friends. Sir Simon Warde (Sheriff) rushes in: he brings news that the Scots have outflanked the English army and are marching on York. The nobles urge Edward to confront the Scots, but Despenser tries to dissuade the king from leaving the safety of York. Eventually the lords win through and Edward begins to leave, saying farewell to Despenser. Isabella asks him if he has no words for her and he replies 'why truly ay! I go to Berwick that I may have less of your company.' Her ladies try to comfort her. A messenger tells the archbishop that the Scots are drawing near. The queen is urged to leave; reluctant at first, she is eventually persuaded. A Scottish party, including Sir Robert Keith and Sir Alexander Seton arrives: they demand to know the whereabouts of the queen. All refuse to tell and the Scots rush out in pursuit of her. The scene ends with the archbishop rallying citizens and clergy in support of the queen. They leave crying, 'To Myton! To Myton!'\n\nScene VI. AD 1328\n\nJohn D'Arcy (Sheriff of York), Nicholas Langton (Mayor), Archbishop William Melton and others enter; the sheriff, mayor and archbishop are discussing the events at the Battle of Myton seven years previously when the mayor—Nicholas Fleming—lost his life. A large crowd of townsfolk enter; among them are young girls with baskets of flowers, Morris dancers and sword dancers. All await Edward III who has come to meet his new bride, Philippa, for the first time. A herald announces the arrival of a great many nobles who each arrive on horseback accompanied by retinues; then the king appeares. In advance of the arrival of Philippa, he is asked to greet the Scottish lords who have come to York. He does so reluctantly. Edward is heard to greet Sir James Douglas who has broken his journey to Jerusalem (where he was taking the heart of the Bruce) in order to be there. Philippa then arrives on horseback. The king greets her. Both are then seated on thrones; the mayor presents the queen with the gift of a golden cup from the city of York. Performers dressed as 'Robin Hood, Maid Marion and their merry company' present Morris and sword dancing.\n\nScene VII. AD 1389\n\nThomas Arundell (Archbishop of York) and clergy, Mayor William Selby, Robert South, John de Askam and their wives all enter (the crowd from scene VI remained on the arena). Among the clergy is prebendary Richard Maudelyn. Following these are Queen Anne of Bohemia and her retinue, which contains a number of continental nobles. The queen and her ladies are riding side-saddle and the crowd are full of eager curiosity to see this. The English ladies are dismissive of the queen's new-fangled ways. Richard II then arrives on horseback; accompanying him are John of Gaunt, Richard Fitz-Alan, Thomas Beauchamp, Lord Devereux, the sheriff of York and others. The king summons the archbishop and mayor. Anne then draws the attention of the king to Richard Maudelyn: this is because of his strong physical resemblance to King Richard, which is remarked upon with wonder. The king then declares that York will no longer be solely a city, but a county as well. He knights the mayor of York and declares that the mayor's wife shall have the title of 'my lady' as a lifetime appellation. He gifts the sword used for the investiture to York—for future use as a 'Sword of State'. All then exit the arena in procession.\n\nScene VIII. AD 1405\n\nCitizens discuss Archbishop Richard Scrope's challenge to Henry IV's rule. There is support for the archbishop, but also some voices of dissent who wish no further strife. Some people believe Richard II is still alive, but this is countered by the view that reports of sightings mistaking Richard Maudelyn for the king. The conversation ends with the view being expressed that they are both dead. The earl of Northumberland, Lord Bardolph and John Harrington enter. Harrington reports to the others that all is lost: King Henry's forces have captured the archbishop and their other allies. Henry is on his way to York. Bardolph decides to flee to Wales and Northumberland to Scotland. The king arrives; with him are Prince John, the earl of Westmorland, the marquis of Dorset, the earl of Arundel, Sir Thomas Beaufort, Sir John Stanley and the sheriff of York. The king is determined to put the rebels to death, including the archbishop, though others argue against this. The archbishop of Canterbury (Thomas Arundel) rides in; he is in a dishevelled state and throws himself at Henry's feet. Despite Canterbury's pleas for mercy for York's archbishop, the king remains adamant. Scrope is brought to execution and requests that the executioner behead him with five strokes: 'in token of my Saviour's wounds'. The people of York are shocked and call out that he is a saint.\n\nScene IX. AD 1461\n\nIt is Palm Sunday and Margaret of Anjou, her son Edward and ladies of the court await news from the Battle of Towton; all are assured that the city of York is behind the Lancastrian cause. Henry VI then enters—he is leaning on a body-servant; with the king are baron de Ros, Lord Beauchamp and Thomas D'Arcy. News is delivered that the Lancastrians are defeated. Margaret is furious and Henry is ready to concede that Edward is king in his stead. Henry, Margaret, Edward and all of their retinue ride off to Scotland and exile. Edward IV arrives with the earl of Warwick, Lord Scrope, Lord Stanley, Sir John Wenlock (played by the pageant's president), Lord Berners and Lord Montagu. William Booth (archbishop of York), John Cottingham (abbot of St Mary's), John Stockton (mayor of York) and two sheriffs meet this party. The earls of Devon and Wiltshire are both brought in as prisoners and then led off to execution at Edward's command. The mayor asks for mercy for the city and is dismissed. Edward appoints Wenlock a baron in recognition of his service, and then states that they must go to the Minster and give thanks for victory.\n\nScene X. AD 1483\n\nSeveral clergymen enter, including Sir John Hudson, rector of All Saints, and George Lovell, a monk at St Mary's. The townsfolk are in high spirits; men-at-arms try to keep order. A town crier announces 'that no man go armed in this City with swords nor none other defences... And that men that bring forth the Pageant that they be good players well arrayed and openly speaking upon pain of losing one hundred shillings.' The pageant is duly dragged on, and chandlers prepare to present 'The Angels and the Shepherds'. The guilds enter carrying their banners, followed by the clergy, including the archbishop (Thomas Rotherham), then members of the corporation. With all assembled, King Richard III, Queen Anne and their son Edward enter, accompanied by courtiers and nobles. Some Spanish nobles are also in the party. The mayor greets the king and queen and they are presented with golden cups. The king declares that tomorrow he and the queen will be crowned in the Minster, and that he considers himself 'a genuine Yorkshireman'. Trumpets, drums and cheering follow, and then the pageant begins. At the end of the play, Richard congratulates the players; the entertainment continues with a children's dance. The king then orders that 'largesse is scattered' and the royal party leaves amid more cheering.\n\nNarrative Chorus VI. Hark! A note of strife and ire!\n\nThe choir sings about the coming episode concerning the dissolution of the monasteries and refers to Henry VIII as 'Harry of the ruthless heart'.\n\nEpisode VI. The Dissolution, AD 1530-1603\n\nScene I. AD 1530\n\nMother Shipton sits beside a great cauldron; she looks into the steaming contents and predicts that Cardinal Wolsey will never come to York to be enthroned as archbishop. Seated behind her (thinking themselves unseen) are the Duke of Suffolk, Lord Percy, Lord D'Arcy and a citizen of York called Master Besley. Shipton knows they are there however, and humorously makes them aware of this; they then throw off their cloaks and reveal themselves. They ask the old woman to prove that she can see into the future; she makes various colourful predictions, including some about each of the lords who visit her. They warn her that she will burn as a witch if Wolsey comes to York, but she is unafraid. All make to take their leave and she tells them to inform Wolsey that she will be stitching his shroud.\n\nScene II. AD 1536\n\nCitizen discuss recent events and the fact that 'the North is up against King Harry!' The Lord Mayor of York (William Wright) accompanied by Sir Peter Vavasour, Sir Christopher Hildyard, Sir William Fairfax, Sir John Dainey, Sir George Lawson and Sir Robert Constable, all enter. They wear the badge of the Pilgrimage of Grace (a cross with the letters I.H.S. on). Wright asks that they keep their protest outside the city walls; Constable replies that they will swear to do so, but the citizens are likely to rally to the cause once they have heard Robert Aske speak. Members of the local gentry enter, including Sir Richard Tempest and two women (Ladies Bulmer and Fairfax). Discussion continues before Aske appears on the scene. He produces a notice and asks for it to be displayed: it is a call for the religious orders to return to York. Several monks rush in calling out that Aske is their deliverer. Women encourage men to join the Pilgrimage. The crowd grows excited as a member of the Percy family arrives on horseback. Aske delivers an address that is met with wild enthusiasm. He tries to impress upon the mob that this is a peaceable protest and asks all to march with him to Pomfret [Pontefract]. The scene ends with singing of a 'Marching Song'.\n\nScene III. AD 1541\n\nThe Lord Mayor of York (Robert Hall) enters, together with sheriffs and members of the corporation; they are joined by the Mayors of Hull and Newcastle. A member of the corporation (Sir Ralph Clayton) is anxious about the speech he must give to the king. All wear 'penitential garments'. Sir Robert Bowes and Archbishop Lee enter in advance of the arrival of King Henry VIII. The king appears, accompanied by the Duke of Norfolk, the earl of Southampton, Lord Parr of Kendal, the Duke of Suffolk, the Bishop of Durham, and Catherine [sic] Howard; those waiting fall to their knees. The queen advises the king to be merciful but Henry is bellicose. The Archbishop of York steps forward and gives Henry a purse containing £600; Henry complains that Yorkshire churches still contain idols. Then Bowes comes forward, giving the king £900 from 'the gentlemen of the County'. The mayors of Hull and Newcastle give similar gifts; then the Lord Mayor of York offers £100 and £40 to the queen. The king complains about these amounts and impatiently interrupts Clayton's speech in which he begs for the forgiveness for the city. Before retiring, he states that he will appoint a council to rule the north. The king goes off leaning on the arm of Lord Parr. He asks of news of his sister (Katherine Parr). Finally, the king asks for news of the King James of Scotland who is supposed to be travelling to York to meet with him; he is told that there is no news of this arrival. Henry curses James. All leave the arena.\n\nScene IV. AD 1603\n\nA huge procession enters headed by city dignitaries who are accompanying James I. The monarch is under a canopy and converses with Dr Thornborough (Dean of York, later Bishop of Worcester). In his wake are the Duke of Lennox, Lord Home, the Earl of Argyle, Lord Roxburgh, the Earl of Northumberland and several others. From the other side of the arena, citizens and a choir of singers enter. The king addresses the Lord Mayor (Robert Watter) saying that he has enjoyed his visit in York. He enquires about the maker of the cup given to him as a gift from the city and is told that it is Christopher Harrington. The king asks to see Harrington and the goldsmith is brought forward to receive the king's thanks; James states that 'an English King is delighted to honour an English craftsman'. The king then knights the mayor and orders the release of prisoners in York jail. Queen Anne is then ushered in; with her are her eldest children Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth. Madrigal singers prepare to perform and the mayor's wife asks if the Queen would like some refreshments. She is offered spiced wine; but with some embarrassment, she states that she is 'perishing of thirst' and asks instead if she may have a mug of beer. Great hilarity ensues. The queen says that she has been quick to learn local ways and proposes a toast using local dialect:' Here's tiv us—all on us—May we niver want nowt—none on us—me an' all!' Everyone cheers, and the singers then perform a madrigal.\n\nNarrative Chorus VII. What means this shouting?\n\nA chorus on the subject of King Charles I is sung, describing him as the 'unhappy King'.\n\nEpisode VII. The Siege, AD 1642-1644\n\nCitizens enter; they discuss events taking place in the Minster where a meeting of the 'Chapter of the Most Noble Order of the Garter' is taking place at which the young Prince James is in attendance so that he can be elected to this body. Discussion continues and the Lord Mayor (Sir Edmund Cowper) enters; Sir William Allenson (York's MP) passes by and richly attired lords and ladies also arrive: they remark that 'life is worth living in York since his Majesty hath brought his court hither'. Allenson approaches Sir Thomas Fairfax and presents him with a petition and a request that he present this to the king. Fairfax replies, 'I am to bell the cat eh?... Nothing will move Charles' pride. But I will present the petition'. A crowd of young boys announces the king's exit from the Minster. With the king and members of the Chapter are his sons Charles (age 12) and James (age 9), Charles Lewis, the earl of Lindsay, the Bishop of Winchester, the earl of Caernarvon and others. A 'gentleman' approaches with a petition on behalf of the nobility and gentry of York that the king not remove his 'sacred person' from among them, and that he maintain the arsenal at Hull. Charles states he will give close study to this petition. Fairfax then approaches with his own petition for the king, asking that his majesty 'rely, not on armed force, but on the known love and loyalty of your commons'. This is 'coldly' received.\n\nSir Francis Wortley and Sir Robert Strickland enter with a detachment of soldiers on horseback; Wortley reports that this is the king's own bodyguard, under the formal command of the Prince of Wales, though he is lieutenant. It now numbers 200 'of the flower of our young gentlemen of Yorkshire'. Strickland indicates that there are also 700 foot soldiers. Prince Charles asks why he cannot take command, and his father explains that his mother would not approve. The king makes a snide comment to Fairfax about the strength of his bodyguard to which Fairfax replies that his enemies will now understand that the king is 'arming against Parliament'. Fairfax leaves in despair. The king announces that they will go to Hull to check on the arsenal there and is told that the 'Governor' in Hull is 'a hot Parliament man'. But Charles pays no heed and rides off with his bodyguard. Sir Thomas Glemham arrives and announces to Cowper that the king has appointed him governor of the city. It transpires that Cowper's position as Lord Mayor has also been made by royal appointment.\n\nQueen Henrietta Maria then arrives in a coach guarded by the Duke of Newcastle. She is travel-weary, as are all the women in her retinue. The queen reports that she has two million pounds 'begged, borrowed and—yes! very nearly stolen'. The Marquis of Montrose arrives and offers his services to the queen. Henrietta then begs the women to give her their jewels in aid of the king's cause. Many ladies come forward and offer their jewellery; then an old woman gives a silver cup, saying it belonged to her late husband and this is all she has to give. The queen is very touched. A citizen who supports parliament is so moved by Henrietta's bravery and loyalty that he gives his fob watch. The queen then leaves, cheered on by citizens who walk beside her coach. Frantic activity then takes place: troops march, trumpets sound, firing is heard in the distance. Glemham reads a despatch that does not provide good news. The Duke of Newcastle notices that people are streaming towards the Minster for it is Trinity Sunday and he and others go too. A few Royalists are left behind and they discuss the bad state of affairs. The arena empties, but this is a calm before the storm.\n\nA loud explosion is heard and Parliamentarians rush in, led by Colonel Crayford. But behind them come 'Whitecoats' led by the Duke of Newcastle. There is hand-to-hand combat and eventually the Royalists overcome the Parliamentarians, through in the assault the tower of St Mary's has been blown up and all the city's records destroyed. A messenger brings news that Prince Rupert has arrived. The prince enters and urges a move to Marston Moor where Fairfax has withdrawn. The duke advises caution, for he expects the arrival of more troops in a few days, but the prince is determined to move quickly. Loyally, the duke agrees to go with him to meet the Parliamentary forces. Those left behind kneel and pray: the break into singing of Psalm 68. A wounded messenger arrives and interrupts the song; other wounded soldiers follow. The news is that the Royalists have been beaten; the Prince has retreated into Lancashire and Lord Newcastle has flown the country.\n\nSir William Constable arrives bearing a flag of truce; he addresses Sir Thomas Glemham as governor of the city and delivers a missive from Fairfax which reads:\n\nCitizens in no way to be molested—incoming garrison to be two parts men of Yorkshire—No billeting—no fines—no arrests—churches and buildings to be respected... York has fought a good fight: it has stood a siege of eighteen weeks; it has repulsed twenty-two attacks and four countermines; and you, Sir Thomas, have done all a man could. Now you are alone with only one regiment—you can do no more.\n\nGlemham accepts the terms. At this Lord Ferdinando Fairfax, Sir Thomas Fairfax, the Earl of Manchester enter; they are met by a new mayor named Hoyle. The Parliamentary army follow; but the Royalist soldiers enter 'spiritedly', accompanied by many townspeople. Fairfax's men salute them. The scene ends with Thomas fairfax calling on all soldiers and citizens to go to the Minster to give thanks. The arena empties.\n\nThe Final Tableau\n\nThe boys of St Peter's School march on carrying a banner and sing in Latin.\n\nNarrative Chorus\n\nThe narrative and dramatic choruses join together to sing the triumph song of York.\n\nFinale\n\nAll the performers return to the arena; together with the audience they sing the hymn 'All People that on Earth Do Dwell'. The National Anthem is then sung, finally all of the performers march past.\n\nKey historical figures mentioned\n\nCartimandua [Claudia Cartimandua, Julia Cartimandua] (d. after AD 69) queen of the Brigantes\n\nVenutius (fl.
