        "text": "This timeline is composed of events that take place in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I (LGV1), Volume II (LGV2), The Black Dossier (BLKD), the three issues of Volume III: Century (CENT), the side-stories \"Nemo: Heart Of Ice\" and \"Nemo: The Roses Of Berlin\" as well as the side stories \"Allan and the Sundered Veil\" (ATSV), the events hinted at or briefly covered in the expansive work \"The New Traveller's Almanac\" (TNTA), the three part short story \"Minions of the Moon\" (MINM), and the short story \"A Perfect Match.. And A Perfect Fuse!\".\n\nWhile this timeline concerns itself primarily with events which occur in the canon of LoEG directly, it also mentions several events which, while happening to characters contained in LoEG, are not directly shown in the pages of LoEG, but in the original works the characters were taken from; at some points, however, the fictional canon of LoEG comes into conflict with the worlds of the various fictional works used as components of the LoEG fiction. These places are clearly marked, but as a general rule, unless specifically noted, the events of the sampled fictional canon all are assumed to have happened as depicted in the original work, with the addition of being in a world in which the events of all the other fictional bodies have taken place as well.\n\nThirdly, this timeline heavily sites events from Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. Wherever Lemuel Gulliver is herein mentioned, and no note is made to site a specific reference in Moore's works, it is to be implied that this is in reference to the events this book.[1]\n\nPre-Earth History[]\n\nBirth of the Endless - The primordial cosmic entities Time and Night mate, producing seven anthropomorphic personifications of primal concepts: Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delight, the last of whom will transform into Delirium under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThe Dark Times - The Dark Times, a time of “Blood and magic”, during which the Nestenes, Great Vampires, Racnoss, Weeping Angels, and Carrionites flourish.
