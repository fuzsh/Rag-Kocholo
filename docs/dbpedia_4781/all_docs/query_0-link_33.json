        "text": "By Patrick Skene.\n\n30th September 2021\n\nThe story of the proud Māori men that saved rugby league! As one of the greatest ever NRL finals series draws to a close, its worth pausing to remember a group of Māori pioneers who were responsible for saving Australian rugby league from financial ruin.\n\nWhen Australians talk of rugby league’s history, the contribution of their Māori brothers in the early and fragile part of the game’s development is rarely mentioned. The Māori are often classed as recent interlopers to the NRL who should be grateful for the opportunity. The historical record tells another story.\n\nIn fact, Māori were a crucial stakeholder at the genesis of Australian rugby league in 1908.\n\n“We Māori were partners at the very founding of the game in Australia,” explains Howie Tamati, former Kiwis hooker and ex President of the New Zealand Rugby League.\n\n“We are a concrete part of the foundation. Not many people know it, but the proceeds from the “All Māori” tours of Australia were crucial in saving rugby league in its moment of crisis.”\n\nAnd a crisis it was. The 1908 inaugural Kangaroos tour of England had been a financial disaster with the English authorities having to pay for their trip home. The game’s backer JJ Giltinan, was declared bankrupt and many feared the 1909 season would not go ahead, leaving the game stillborn and the players returning to rugby union.\n\nThe game was on its knees and needed a saviour and up stepped a group of heroes who set off across the Tasman in a steamer."
