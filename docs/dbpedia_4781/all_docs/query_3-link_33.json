It once functioned as the Lake Forest housing development field office for the S.H. Kleinman Realty Co.Summit Memory257 Atterbury Boulevard\n\nThis home was the second built in the original S.H. Kleinman Realty Co.-planned Lake Forest Residential Park, Country Club and Golf Course development. More than 1000 homes had been planned for this complex, but only two homes and a clubhouse had been completed before the 1929 stock market crash. This circa-1928 Tudor Revival home was built for Leslie Sadler (1883-1947), secretary-treasurer of Cottage Creamery in Cleveland.\n\nSummit Memory2357 Aurora Road\n\nThis home, first built in 1824 by Horace Metcalf (1791-1865), remained with the Metcalf family until 1928. Metcalf was married to the daughter of Dr. Moses Thompson (1776-1858), who arrived in Hudson with town founder David Hudson (1761-1836) in 1800. This home, known as Maplewood Farm, takes its name from the grove of maple trees where prizewinning sap was harvested to create maple syrup. Music was common in this house; noted musicians have often inhabited the home.\n\nSummit Memory2727 Aurora Road\n\nThis late-Colonial Connecticut-style farm house, circa 1823, was once declared the \"favorite\" home of Owen Brown (1771-1856), father of abolitionist John Brown (1800-1859). Owen was \"stationmaster\" on the Underground Railroad in Hudson. Wide plank floors still remain in the upstairs.\n\nSummit Memory2827 Aurora Road\n\nThis 1835 home was occupied by abolitionist Owen Brown (1771-1856) with his second wife, Sally Root Brown (1789-1840). Later the Knight family, publishers of the \"Akron Beacon Journal\", lived here. The house is typical Greek Revival with some Federal elements. At some point in its history this house suffered a fire in the front corner of the structure. Famed attorney Clarence Darrow (1857-1938) was known to have dined here on occasion.\n\nSummit Memory5 Aurora Street\n\nBrewster Store\n\nView House ReportBuilt in 1839, 5 Aurora is the oldest commercial structure still in use today. This Federal-style building was built by Leander Starr (1804-1885) and originally housed Kent and Brewster's Dry Goods Store. In 1908 James Ellsworth (1849-1925) opened the National Bank of Hudson in this building. The movement to save this building from destruction in 1962 led to the founding of the Hudson Heritage Association. Banks have occupied this building since Ellsworth's day.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 9 Aurora Street\n\nBrewster Mansion\n\nView House Report\"Brewster Mansion\" has the unusual distinction of serving as a residential, institutional and commercial building during its long history. The home was built in 1853 for the successful local merchant and former Hudson mayor Anson A. Brewster (1807-1864). The Gothic Revival design has been attributed to Simeon Porter (1807-1871). In the first half of the 20th century, The Park Hotel operated in the Brewster Mansion. After the hotel closed in 1949, the home was used as a rest home known as The Elms. Offices and shops now inhabit the building. The first home of Owen Brown (1771-1856), father of abolitionist John Brown (1800-1859), was formerly on this site.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 19 Aurora Street\n\nChrist Church Episcopal\n\nThe first Christ Church Episcopal Gothic Revival building was erected in 1846 (and consecrated by Bishop Charles Pettit McIlvanie (1799-1873)), but was demolished and replaced with this 1930 Colonial Revival structure. Simeon Porter (1807-1871) designed the first church; Charles Frank (n.d.) was the architect of the current church. Christ Church Episcopal was organized in 1842 with 37 charter members, who included notable citizens Anson Brewster, Jr. (1807-1864) and Dr. Israel Town (1791-1853). The 1930 Christ Church Episcopal building was modeled after St. Christopher's-by-the-River in Gates Mills, Ohio.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 21 Aurora Street\n\nIsham Beebe House\n\nView House Report21 Aurora Street is locally known as the Isham-Beebe House because the Isham family built the home and the Beebe family were long time occupants. It was built in 1832/33 by Leander Starr (1804-1885). Warren Isham (1798-1863) was the publisher of the \"Hudson Observer and Telegraph,\" which had a circulation of 1400 in 1831. His son, Warren Parsons Isham (1831-1863), was born and raised in this home and went on to be the assistant editor of the \"Chicago Times\" and later was shipwrecked on Lake Superior. The Greek Revival structure has original timbers in the attic and original plaster over split lathe in some areas. The present entrance on Aurora Street was modified and not of the original construction. During the 1850s successful merchant and former Hudson Mayor, Anson Brewster (1807-1864) bought the property and gifted it to his daughter, Ellen Brewster Beebe (1836-1912) and son-in-law and Hudson Mayor, David Duncan Beebe (1831-1889) as a wedding gift. Christ Church Episcopal acquired the architectural gem during the 1940s.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 29 Aurora Street\n\nThis structure was demolished in 1970. It was once the home of former Hudson Mayor and civil war surgeon, Dr. George P. Ashmun (1818-1873) who survived the Battle of Chickamanga and was held prisoner nearly three months at Libby Prison. Later owners were Fire Chief Frank Mitchell (1868-1942) and the Winfield family who owned and operated MA Winfield's Restaurant. Christ Church Episcopal now owns the property.Summit Memory 30 Aurora Street\n\nWhedon Farwell House\n\nView House ReportThe distinctive Whedon Farwell home is one of Hudson's Ohio's oldest and finest homes. It was built in 1826-27 for Deacon Benjamin Whedon (1779-1833), who was excommunicated from the Congregational Church for hosting a dance in the home in 1830. The Tuscan tower is an added feature. The interior features elaborate plasterwork and unusual walnut and cherry woodwork. The house was built facing directly west according to the points of a compass. Charles Farwell (1821-1904) took possession in 1850 and occupied the structure for six generations. Farwell, like others in Hudson, sent two sons to the Civil War. Arba P. Farwell (1849-1880) served as a musican, while his brother Henry Farwell served as a minister (1846-1925); both returned home after the war. Later the home was used as a day care center as well as a Christian Science Society meeting place. Today it is again a residence.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 33 Aurora Street\n\nThis home, destroyed in 1972, was home to Dr. George A. (1875-1935) and Helen Miller (1885-1970). Helen was the head librarian of Hudson Library & Historical Society. George was a Mason, Rotarian, and World War I veteran. He was the first physician in Hudson to own and operate an automobile in his medical practice.Summit Memory 34 Aurora Street\n\nHenry Holmes House\n\nView House ReportMoses Draper (1796-1873) bought this property intending to build a home for his son, James Draper (1827-1864) and daughter-in-law, Addie Andrews Draper Holmes (1837-1927). When James unexpectedly died during the Civil War in Tennessee, Moses gifted the property to Addie who in late 1864 remarried English emigrant and wagon-maker Henry Holmes (1836-1885). Addie and Henry built this 1876 home and raised their family here. Another son of Moses, Arvin (1829- ) also served in the Civil War.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 37 Aurora Street\n\nBrick Academy\n\nThis brick building with Gothic Revival characteristics first was built by John B. Clark (1793-1872), most likely as an investment property. Newton Jerome Randall (1852-1938), a longtime employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a self-professed lover of grammar, once resided here. In 2000, the home was relocated to Oviatt Street. It is now utilized as Western Reserve Academy housing.Summit Memory 38 Aurora Street\n\nIsaac Quay House\n\nView House ReportThis house has two distinct sections and was built in two stages. The rear section is circa 1860 and the front section is circa 1846. The home was built for local shoemaker Issac Quay (1808-1880). Daughters Maria Antoinette (1849-1929) and Martha (1832-1903) were early trustees of Hudson Library & Historical Society.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 41 Aurora Street\n\nThis 1833 house was once home to Caroline Ellsworth Blackburn (1869-1950), Western Reserve Academy graduate, reporter and advocate of wooden sidewalks. Later the house was moved for expansion of the Congregational Church. It now resides at 189 Aurora.\n\nSummit Memory 42 Aurora Street\n\nThis house is the second home at this location. Myron Tracy (1798-1855), a missionary minister, purchased the first home in 1845. Several members of Tracy's family are listed as occupants in 1860, including his brother-in-law Dr. Elias Weld (1772-1863), his nephew Lewis H. Delano (1836-1866), a Civil War soldier and his son Samuel J. Tracy (1835-1881), a captain in the 177th Ohio Volunteer Infantry who participated in the battle at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Dr. Elias Weld lived in this home during the last few years of his life. Prior to moving to Hudson, Dr. Weld mentored the young John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892), future renowned American poet. When Weld lived in Haverhill, Massachusetts, he gave Whittier access to his personal library. As a tribute Whittier dedicated his poem, \"The Countess,\" to Weld. In 1866 a fire burned the first home and a new home was built by Dr. Levi D. Osbourne (1820-1902), a doctor educated at Lake Erie Medical College in Willoughby, Ohio, who moved to Hudson in 1854 to practice medicine. Ernest E. Hedler, Jr. (1915-1992), member of the Hudson council in the 1940s and active with the Hudson Masonic Lodge, was a later owner. His wife, Pauline Hedler (1914-1990), helped start the Ice Cream Social in Hudson. Summit Memory 47 Aurora Street\n\nFirst Congregational Church\n\nSimeon Porter (1807-1871), famed local architect, built and designed the present First Congregational Church in 1865. John W.C. Corbusier (1878-1928) designed the 1919 addition. The First Congregational Church was founded in 1802 by 13 charter members, including David Hudson (1761-1836), founder of Hudson. Famed abolitionist John Brown (1800-1859) was also a member. The first church building was erected in 1819/1820 at the site of the present Town Hall.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 48 Aurora Street\n\nKirkham-Porter House\n\nView House ReportThe Kirkham-Porter House was built in 1829 and like many Hudson, Ohio houses, the style is Federal cum Victorian. We know the date of construction thanks to David Hudson Jr.'s diary entry (1805-1836) The siding and second story windows are original to 1829. There have been two major remodelings since the original construction. The house was purchased in 1833 by the widow of Lemuel Porter (1775-1829), architect-builder. Margaret Porter (1779-1847) desired to be closer to her married daughters living in town. Deed descriptions and maps refer to \"the Widow Porter's house.\" The Congregational Church used the home as a parsonage from 1888 until 1916. Recently uncovered is a tiled fish pond in the yard which is now under a paved driveway. Note the distinctive Pierce Arrow automobile.\n\nHudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory 52 Aurora Street\n\nThis home, with a side-gabled roof, boxed eaves and returns, was once home to Hudson Library & Historical Society employee Betty Kafer (1910-2001).Summit Memory 53 Aurora Street\n\nJames W. Ellsworth (1849-1925) gifted this lovely Neoclassical Revival home to the First Congregational Church for use as a parsonage in 1908. The home was designed by John W.C. Corbusier (1878-1928).Summit Memory64 Aurora Street\n\nThis Colonial Revival with a pedimented portico and Doric columns was once home to 32 degreed Mason Vincent Meakin (1857-1934), who came from Crew, England. The property left the Meakin family in 1934. Further research is needed on this structure.Summit Memory72 Aurora Street\n\nThis house is a good example of the Victorian era of architecture. It was a time of great romanticism and standardized building techniques. Balloon-frame construction with machined nails and standard board dimensions allowed for more economic and efficient house construction. Interior innovations included cast-iron stoves, which replaced inefficient fireplaces. This house is most probably of the 1880s vintage, but little research has been done.Summit Memory78 Aurora Street\n\nCharles S.

Peck was a Connecticut native and attended the Pioneer Association of Portage & Summit Counties. He fathered four children, many of whom moved to the west coast. Peck must have been familiar with many of the local schoolchildren as one of the town schoolhouses was located to the north of this house. He also was a carpenter/joiner.\n\nSummit Memory12 Baldwin Street\n\nMoses & Elmira Messer House\n\nView House ReportThis 1854 Italianate home typifies the style with its symmetry, a low pitched roof, and wide overhangs. The front porch is original to the house. Porches were not common prior to the 1850s. The home was probably built for Western Reserve College Treasurer Moses Messer (1803-1890.) Civil War veteran Prosper Gott (1846-1922) once occupied this home. The home, with its multitude of bedrooms and parlors, reflects the changing values of the era, moving away from being an economic center of production (such as farm) and to becoming a place for socialization. Antique expert and preservationist Charles M. Stow (1880-1952) was born here More research is needed on this structure.\n\nSummit Memory15 Baldwin Street\n\nStrong-Metcalf Female Seminary\n\nView House ReportThis 1845 Greek Revival building was once located on the west side of North Main Street (on the property of the home at 258 N.

He was Master Mason in the Hudson Masonic Lodge, church treasurer at the First Christian Church of Hudson for more than 30 years, and a longtime Pennsylvania Railroad employee.\n\nSummit Memory29 Baldwin Street\n\nThis house was once home to Edwin (1900-1975) and Madge (1906-2002) Headland. Mrs. Headland was a teacher at Polk State Training School in Polk, Pennsylvania, and Mr. Headland worked for Enamel Products Company of Cleveland. Both were active in community organizations. It is thought this house was built circa 1900 of salvage materials from old buildings in the area. More research is needed.\n\nSummit Memory30 Baldwin Street\n\nLittle is known of the history of this early-20th-century home. The front and back yards are clearly visible in this photograph. By the 20th century, the yard was becoming a place for visual display as well as a buffer from the street and new automobiles. Homes were transformed with an \"outdoor room.\" Franklin S. Barlow (1912-1996), lifelong resident of Hudson and a graduate of Western Reserve Academy, once occupied this home. In World War II, he served in Germany for three and a half years, rising from a draftee private in the Army to chief warrant officer and assistant adjutant general of the 106th Infantry.\n\nSummit Memory33 Baldwin Street\n\nThis gable-roofed home with dormers is circa 1850s.

They built the home on College street. Alonzo returned to Connecticut and Thompson married Adeline Farwell Hotchkiss (1827-1858) of Hudson, Ohio in 1852 and they occupied this home on College Street. In 1858 Adeline tragically died in childbirth and Hotchkiss sold the house to Issac L'Hommedieu (1812-1884) who would later become Mayor of Hudson, Ohio. It was Charles Kilbourne (1868-1959) who moved the cottage to Baldwin Street in 1914. The Gothic Revival proponents sought to break from traditional white exteriors and advocated earth tones such as reds, grays and olives as exemplified by this colored home. Also popular in Gothic Revivals is the intricately carved wood trim or scroll work often called gingerbread that necessitated the invention of the mechanical saws of the 1850's & 1860's. Despite being moved, this house retains several charming characteristics of days and owners now gone.Hudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory1213 Barlow Road\n\nEllsworth-Kilbourn House\n\nView House ReportThis Federal-style home was built sometime in the late 1820s or early 1830s by Dr. Moses Thompson (1776-1858), the first physician in the Western Reserve. The Flood family purchased the home in 1949 and sandblasted the painted bricks. Flood company president Earl D. Flood (1890-1975) once resided here. This home once served as the executive offices of the Flood Co., a painting business founded in 1841 by members of the Flood family. At one time the Flood Co. was the third-largest business in the United States, producing exterior stains and finishes.

It features a sloping and overhanging roof. The spacious front porch is the hallmark of bungalow layout as it encourages livable outdoor space. Bungalows were economical and yet simple and industrial in their use of space. Little is known about the occupants of this home.\n\nSummit Memory30 Church Street\n\nThe Hudson Heritage Association suggests that this home may be a composite of several houses and may incorporate one of the detached wings of the Town-Neibel House at 19 E. Main St. H.N. Darling (1857-1932), local justice of the peace, was a former resident of this home. Darling also owned a magazine and candy shop in Hudson for 23 years.

Charles Buss was the son of John Buss (1811-1876), successful dry goods merchant of Hudson. After John's death, Charles took over the store and never really left town unless he was buying merchandise for the store. Charles often loaned money privately for real estate.\n\nHudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory37 Church Street\n\nDennis J.

He found happiness with his musically inclined second wife, Flora Mills Edwards (1810-1867). Ernest Fillius (1857-1921), a former Hudson mayor and Summit County commissioner once occupied this home. During the spring of 1950, when the family of Leland L. Smith (1891-1960) occupied the home, a burglar entered the back door and took the first three things he laid eyes on: a gun, a rag and a carton of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

He was also found guilty in 1878 of \"keeping a place of unlawful sale of beverages.\" She lived in the house until her death in 1888. The window upstairs is a replacement, most likely of a Gothic style window. In 1870s, the porch was added, the foundation replaced and there is an addition at the rear. Later owner and milliner, Kate Hild (1866-1965) lived within six weeks of being 100 years old. All the while, she did small jobs of remodeling hats.\n\nHudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory43 Church Street\n\nConstructed most likely in the 1890s, this house was once home to Acme Grocery clerk, Ruth Corbus. (1892-1952).\n\nSummit Memory44 Church Street\n\nThis house was most likely built as a speculation home. A local carpenter, John Holmes (1824-1868) built the house as an investment. Land owner, Mason Grosvenor sold the land to Holmes in 1853 for $225.00 and Holmes sold the same parcel of land with a new house the following year for $1,150.00. The two story Greek Revival house is L-shaped, with a front gable and wing and typical of Hudson, Ohio houses of that period. Not original is an elaborate twelve-paned glass door. Later residents included Hudson Volunteer Fireman, H.J. Weiand (1889-1983) and his wife, and avid bowler, Millie (1906-1982).Summit Memory47 Church Street\n\nSamuel B.

The home was also once the residence of former Hudson, Ohio mayor, Samuel Judd (1813-1892).\n\nHudson Heritage Association\n\nSummit Memory48 Church Street\n\nThis basic home was most likely built by Frederick W. Bunnell (1821-1925) in 1853 on land originally part of Heman OviattÂ’s (1775-1854) property (and then Western Reserve College when Oviatt deeded his land to the school). Englishman, James Taylor (1809-1884), was one of Hudson, Ohio's dray-men and newly married to Irish lass Jane Thompson Taylor (1831-1906). They needed a place to call home and start a family. This simple styled home fit their purpose.

Ellsworth added Seymour Hall in 1913 and improved other buildings with the hope of attracting another college. In 1916 Western Reserve Academy opened at the old college campus. Seymour Hall, a Colonial Revival, was designed by architect John W.C. Corbusier (1878-1928). The hall stands at the former location of Middle and South colleges, Western Reserve College's first two buildings. Seymour Hall was named after Professor Nathan Perkins Seymour (1813-1891) and his son, Professor Thomas Day Seymour (1848-1907). Nathan was the chair of Latin and Greek at Western Reserve College.

This home is an example of the perfection of technologies introduced in building in the late nineteenth century. The systems of plumbing, electrical and utilities are standardized and integrated within the structure. It was one of the first homes to have a telephone in Hudson, Ohio with the phone number as \"Hudson 8.\" Rotarian and Business Manager for Western Reserve Academy, Russell Tilt (1892-1990) lived here for several happy years.\n\nSummit Memory126 College Street\n\nThis two-story Western Reserve Academy-owned property has housed students at various times.

The builders were most likely Porter and Rice, who were the college architects at the time. This structure originally sat at the corner of College and Chapel streets and was relocated here in the late-19th or early-20th century. Dr. Angus Frew (1874-1941), who was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and taught at Western Reserve Academy, also occupied this residence.\n\nSummit Memory135 College Street\n\nChapel, Western Reserve Academy\n\nThe college chapel, built in 1835-36 by Simeon Porter (1807-1871), was intended to serve multiple functions. The building housed a library and a museum on the first floor and a chapel on the second floor, used for commencements, weddings and funerals. James Garfield (1831-1881) and John Seiberling (1918-2008) both spoke here. The chapelÂ’s interior details also boast an interesting history. A bell cast in 1611 in Souburg, Holland, was installed in 1944. A cross hanging in the chapel comes from the Spanish monastery Santa Maria de La Rabida, the monastery where Christopher Columbus stayed prior to his famed 1492 voyage to America.

The building was part of the original Western Reserve College brick row, a row of brick buildings lined up north to south on College Street facing east. This particular alignment was probably chosen to match similar arrangements at New England colleges like Yale and Amherst. North Hall has always served as a dormitory. Individuals who once inhabited North Hall as students include playwright Arthur M. Hopkins (1878-1950) and well-known author and journalist Lucien Price (1883-1964).
