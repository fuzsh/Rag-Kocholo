        "text": "Newcastle Entertainment Centre is a multi-purpose arena opened in 1992 and located in the Newcastle Showground. A significant upgrade was completed in 1998 to install airconditioning and an additional 798 seats.\n\nThe Centre's original tenant was the Newcastle Falcons NBL team who moved to the new venue in 1992 from their previous home at the Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium. After the Falcons folded at the end of the 1999 season the only remaining tenant was the Hunter Jaegers netball team who played in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy until 2008. From 2003 to 2008 the Centre served as the home court for another NBL team, the Hunter Pirates.\n\nThe Newcastle Showgrounds has been in existence since 1902 hosting the annual Newcastle Show. The Showground hosted the Newcastle Rebels rugby league team in 1909 when it participated in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. The Showground was also the home of Harness Racing in the Newcastle area for 50 years until 1989."
