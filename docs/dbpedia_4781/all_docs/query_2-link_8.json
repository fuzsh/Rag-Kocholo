Yet, up to this time, although partial sketches, historical and biographical, have appeared, no attempt at a regular history of it has been published, and, now such a history can not be written because of the destruction, by fires and otherwise, of a large part of the material requisite for the purpose. There was, perhaps, no part of the country where so many planters’ residences with all their contents were lost by fire as on the Cape Fear and its tributaries, and it is well known among the descendants of those planters, some of whom were also members of the learned professions, that by these fires many manuscripts, family records, and documents of various kinds that would have been invaluable as material for the preparation of a local history, were lost. Besides these fires, the town of Wilmington was at an early period, as well as several times afterwards, nearly destroyed in the same way with the same results.\n\nNone of the ancient official records of the town of Brunswick were preserved, and a considerable part of the County records were destroyed by Northern soldiers when the town of Smithville (now Southport) was captured by them in 1865. Some of the town records of Wilmington of an early period have also disappeared.\n\nThere is enough material, however, for a fairly full history in the publications referred to, in the court records, and especially in the Colonial Records; and the writer of this book has undertaken the task of collating all the facts bearing upon the subject that are known. The volume covers only the period from 1723 to 1800. A second volume extending the work to the beginning of the war of 1861-65 may be published, if considered\n\nadvisable. When this book was first projected William B. McKoy, Esq., of the Wilmington Bar, intended to unite with the author in preparing it as their joint work, but Mr. McKoy found it impossible to devote the necessary time to it, and reluctantly abandoned the enterprise. He, however, generously furnished some valuable material from his unequaled store of notes and memoranda on our local history, for which the author desires to make especial acknowledgment of his thanks. Mr. McKoy promises to publish at some early day a small work entitled “Chronicles of Wilmington.”\n\nThe author is also under obligations to Messrs. Junius Davis, R. D. W. Connor, James Sprunt and J. Alves Walker, for various documents kindly loaned that have been helpful to him.\n\nALFRED MOORE WADDELL.\n\nWilmington, Nov. 5, 1909.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRECINCT IN 1729 (CHANGED TO\n\nCOUNTY IN 1738)—ITS LIMITS—BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN\n\nNORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA—THE TOWN OF BRUNSWICK\n\nAND ITS HISTORY—HISTORY OF ST. PHILIP'S CHURCH—\n\nTHE STAMP ACT TROUBLES—SONS OF LIBERTY.\n\nIn the first subdivision of that part of the province of “Carolina” which has since the year 1729 been known as North Carolina, all the territory south of Albemarle and extending to the Cape Fear River was called Bath County, but its limits were undefined toward the South.* This southern part was, however, by an Act of Assembly, passed in July 1729, “erected into the precinct of New Hanover,” the boundaries of which were prescribed to be “to the Northward by the Haule-over and Little Inlet, and to the Southward by the Southernmost bounds of the Province.”\n\nThere were several places call the “Haulover” along the coast lower down than that named in the act. Little Inlet is marked on Wimble's map (1738), and was north of New River and between it and White Oak river, which identifies it with either Brown's, or Bear Inlet.\n\nIn 1734 an act was passed reciting that “as the precinct of New Hanover is now become very populous, and the extent thereof being found too incommodious to many of the inhabitants thereof, particularly those of New River and the upper part of the North West river,” it was therefore enacted that a precinct be erected at New River by the name of Onslow precinct, and in the same Act “the upper part of the Northwest river” was “erected into a precinct by the name of Bladen precinct,” the boundaries of each being prescribed.†\n\nThe southern boundary of New Hanover, named in the Act\n\n* The territory south and west of the Cape Fear river, of which Yeamans was appointed governor in 1664, was named Clarendon county and extended to Florida. Albemarle and Clarendon were established in 1664, and Bath in 1669.† Martin's Pub. Stat., 38.\n\nof 1729 was “the Southernmost bounds of the province,” as already stated.\n\nWhere was this southernmost boundary line? For some time after the first settlements were made on the lower Cape Fear River that river was supposed to be the boundary line, and many grants for land south and west of the river were made by the Governors of the southern province (South Carolina) which then claimed and still claims the name “Carolina,” but in the year 1729 the nominal division into North and South Carolina was generally recognized, and a start toward running the boundary line was made in 1734,* but it extended only a comparatively short distance, and the line continued to be a subject of doubt and uncertainty for half a century or more.\n\n“This matter of boundary,” says McCrady† in his History of South Carolina, “had not been of so much importance while the two colonies constituted but one province. But now that under his Majesty's government the territory was divided and distinct governments established, it became necessary that the limits of the two provinces, as they now were, should be definitely defined. In fact, however, this matter was not finally settled until 1815, and in the meanwhile was the subject of many disputes.”\n\nThe original controversy over the boundary line arose out of the apparently conflicting instructions on the subject from the home government to Governor Burrington, of North Carolina, and Governor Johnson, of South Carolina, as to whether the line should be run from the mouth of Waccamaw River, or from a point thirty miles from the mouth of Cape Fear River, and continuing thence westwardly. Burrington displayed maps to the authorities in favor of the latter and his contention was sustained.\n\nThe line as finally run looks like a series of steps from the Atlantic toward the northwest for half its length, and an\n\n* The commissioners on the part of North Carolina to run this line were Eleazer Allen, Edward Moseley, Robert Halton, Mathew Rowan, and Roger Moore.† II, 110. In his Prefatory Chapter to the second volume of the Colonial Records, Colonel Saunders gives a very interesting summary of the history of this controversy.\n\nirregular west line for the other half, and, like some other State lines, is a geographical absurdity illustrative of the jealousy and land grabbing propensity of our race.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean was the eastern boundary of New Hanover County, and the western boundary was “the South Seas,” which was a term in common use, but conveyed no more meaning in the then state of geographical knowledge than “the land of sunset” would have done; but it was sufficient to embrace a territory of the width of the county indefinitely westward, which made it literally a boundless empire with a very sparse population confined to the extreme eastern end.*\n\nNew Hanover precinct was alleged to have been unlawfully established by Governor Everard and his council without the concurrence of the Assembly in 1729, but John Swann and John Porter were in that year elected representatives to the Assembly, and Swann was admitted to his seat, although Porter does not seem to have taken his. The act establishing the precinct was part of an act for regulating vestries, which act was repealed as to church matters, but not specifically repealed as to the precinct.\n\nIt was a matter of controversy up to the time of Dobbs's administration, and in 1760 Dobbs wrote to the Board of Trade a full statement as to the legislation, justifying his order for an election of representatives to the Assembly, and that caused a final settlement of the matter.\n\nNew Hanover is now the smallest county in the State, containing, according to a United States survey, only about 122,752 acres, or approximately 192 square miles, in the shape of a narrow triangle pointing southward, and is the southernmost county, except one (Brunswick) in the State.\n\nIn the treatment of his subject the author will confine himself chiefly to the territory generally called the lower Cape Fear region, embracing the present county of New Hanover, and the counties of Bladen, Brunswick, and Pender. He will\n\n* Out of the territory of New Hanover the whole southern tier of counties of the State, including Onslow and Duplin, and thence westward, was carved. The dates of their respective formation may be found in Wheeler's History and other books.\n\nnot go back to the first attempts at colonization by the New England adventurers in 1660, and the Yeamans colony in 1664-65, for they were only temporary settlements and interesting incidents in our earliest history; but he begins with the first settlement at the town of Brunswick and along both branches of the river in the years 1723, 1724, and 1725. Contemporaneously with, and even prior to the settlement of the town, the larger part of the best lands on both branches of the river had been patented by the wealthier settlers.\n\nOLD BRUNSWICK.\n\nThe history of this vanished town, of which the only remains are the four walls of its once imposing church, some tombstones, and the basements of some buildings covered by the mould of the surrounding forest, is both interesting and pathetic. It was laid out in 1725 on part of 320 acres of land given for the purpose by Col. Maurice Moore, second son of Governor James Moore of South Carolina, who had first come to the Albemarle country to aid in the suppression of the Indians in 1713, and, after making his home there for about ten years, removed to the Cape Fear, having induced his two brothers, Roger and Nathaniel, living in South Carolina, and other friends there and in Albemarle, to unite with him in founding the new settlement. A recital of some of the facts connected with the establishment of the town is contained in the preamble of an Act of Assembly passed in 1745, twenty years afterwards, entitled: “An Act to encourage persons to settle in the town of Brunswick on the southwest side of the Cape Fear River,” which act also recites the conditions as to trade and navigation on the Cape Fear, and other facts, as good reasons to justify its passage.\n\nAt March term, 1727, of the General Court, held at Edenton, the following entry was made: “It being represented to this Court that it is highly necessary that a ferry should be settled over Cape Fear River, and that part of the province not being laid out into precincts, therefore it is by this Court ordered\n\nthat the ferry be kept for that river by Cornelius Harnett from the place designed for a town on the west side of the river to a place called the haule-over*, and that he receive the sum of five shillings for a man and horse, and half a crown for each person, and that no person to keep any ferry within ten miles of the said place.”\n\nThe Cornelius Harnett named in the order of the Court was the father of the distinguished man of that name, justly called “the pride of the Cape Fear,” and was afterwards the inn-keeper at Brunswick. He came from Albemarle, where he had married Mary,† daughter of Martin Holt (who succeeded him as inn-keeper and owner of the ferry), and he was afterwards the first sheriff of the county in 1739-41. His son and only child, above mentioned, married Mary, daughter of Joshua Grainger, Jr., and left no issue.‡\n\nWhen established it was confidently believed that the town of Brunswick would grow into an important city, because of its situation near the mouth of the largest navigable river in the province, and because it was the only town in that region. It certainly seemed a reasonable belief, but, owing to various causes, the hope of its founders was never realized. However, during the half century of its existence it was the theater of stirring events, some of which are justly entitled to an honorable place on the page of history. It was the place of residence of three Colonial Governors—Johnston, Dobbs and Tryon—and three acting Governors—Rice, Rowan and Hasell—and the Assembly of the province convened there several times. It never reached larger proportions than those of a small town, having a white population of not more than four hundred, but there was not at that time, if ever since, a town on the continent\n\n* This haulover was nearly opposite Brunswick, and the land there was conveyed by Maurice Moore to Col. Thomas Merrick April 21, 1736.† Will of Mary Holt, mentioning C. Harnett, Jr., as grandson.—N. H. Records, C., p. 328.‡ The name of Cornelius Harnett's wife was unknown, even on the Cape Fear, for nearly a hundred years, and until discovered by the present writer through references in wills and the fitting together of names and facts, which settled the question. Her sister was the mother of Judge Joshua Grainger Wright, and the ancestress of the prominent Wilmington family of that name. The four daughters of Joshua Grainger, Jr., Ann. Elizabeth, Mary, and Catherine, married Thos. Wright, Obadiah Holt, Cornelius Harnett, Jr., and Henry Young. Holt was Harnett's uncle and their wives were sisters.\n\nof the same size that contained so many men who afterwards became equally distinguished in military and civil life, as an enumeration of some of them will show. First among them were Maj. Gen. Robert Howe and Cornelius Harnett, Jr., and Gen. John Ashe, and Gen. James Moore, and Judges Maurice and Alfred Moore, and Attorney-General Archibald MacLaine, and Chief Justices Allen, Hasell, and Smith, and others of whom further mention will be made when giving a list of the estates on the Cape Fear in the early days.\n\nIn laying out the town, lots were provided for a church, a market, and other public structures.*\n\nTHE PARISH AND CHURCH OF ST. PHILIP.\n\nThe history of the parish and church, which was the largest and handsomest one in the province, is as follows: In the year 1729, a year before there was any organized parish on the Cape Fear, the Rev. John LaPier, “a French Hugnenot who had been ordained by the Bishop of London in 1708, and for many years had served a congregation of his own people in South Carolina, called St. Denis Parish,” came into the region of the Cape Fear River upon the invitation of the people. He served for several years and removed to New Bern about 1735. He was succeeded by Rev. Richard Marsden, who had also been a minister in South Carolina from 1705 to 1709, but had removed to New Hanover and become a planter, trader, and ship owner. He died in 1742.† These two ministers served both St. Philip's at Brunswick and St. James's at Wilmington. Then in 1741 Rev. James Moir, also from South Carolina, came to St. James's first and then to St. Philip's, and served until about 1746, when, without notice, he went to Edgecombe on invitation of the\n\n* At December Term, 1739, of the County Court, a poll tax of five shillings was laid to build a court-house and jail at Brunswick, but this tax was afterwards applied to build a court-house and jail at Wilmington, in pursuance of the determination of Governor Johnston and his faction to remove the seat of government to that place, and thus destroy the older town and the dominating influence of the Moores and their connections, who were designated as “The Family,” and who had brought with them about twelve hundred slaves into the settlement.† John Ellis, in an affidavit made at Brunswick September 17, 1747, stated that he sailed in June on the brigantine. “John and William,” Thomas Corbett, Master, and that she was captured by the Spanish privateer “St. Gabriel, the Conqueror,” and sent to Hispaniola, but was retaken and sent to St. Simons, and that the brigantine belonged to Rev. Richard Marsden.RUINS OF ST. PHILIP'S CHURCH, BRUNSWICK—Exterior\n\npeople. He died at Suffolk, Va., in February, 1766, on the eve of returning to England.\n\nIn 1746, Rev. Christopher Bevis, who had been in the Cape Fear settlement since 1729, preached at the court-house in Wilmington, and was then called to the church at Brunswick, where, Governor Johnston in 1748 mentioned, he had been for two years, and that he had lived all these years as a layman in the province, was generally esteemed and respected for innocence of life and blameless conversation, and only within the last few years let it be known that he was in orders. He proved that he was ordained by the Bishop of Peterborough in 1711. The Governor recommended him to the “Society for the propagation of the Gospel” to fill the vacancy caused by Rev. James Moir, who had, without asking leave, left for the northern part of the colony. Mr. Bevis, in a letter, November 1, 1748, mentioned that he was born in Peterborough, Northamptonshire, and educated at the free school till 1703; then went to Edmund College, Cambridge, and abode there six years; took the degree of A.B., entered orders as a Deacon in the same Cathedral Church, afterwards served in the cure of Bannocks, Northamptonshire, for six or seven winters, then in the cure of Paston, then Wilby for five or six years, and in 1728 he gave up on account of hemorrhages, and in 1729 came to Cape Fear. Mr. Bevis was not able to attend long to his duties on account of ill health, and returned to his plantation, where he died in 1750. In his will, dated December 13, 1750, he left his estate to the church wardens of St. Philip's church for the use of the church, and appointed Richard Quince his executor.\n\nIn 1754, Rev. John McDowell became minister at Wilmington, which was then the largest town in the province. He had been put in orders upon the recommendation of Governor Dobbs, and spent the whole of his ministry in the parishes of St. James and St. Philip. April, 1760, he was made a missionary of the Society upon the recommendation of the vestry of St. Philip's church, and the approval of the Governor\n\n(Dobbs). From 1754 to 1757 he was at St. James's church, and in the latter year took charge of both St. James's and St. Philip's. The church at Brunswick was expected soon to be finished. It was the largest and most pretentious in the province.* Richard Quince and John Davis were church wardens, with Robert Snow, Richard Eagles, Benjamin Davis, Thomas Neal, John Davis, Jr., James Murray, John Watters, Joseph Watters, and William Dry, vestrymen.\n\nGovernor Dobbs wrote to the Society, April 15, 1760, upon the petition of the vestry, and mentioned that St. Philip's was the parish where he resided, that the roof of the church was now being put on, and that he purposed when it was finished, to make it his Majesty's chapel in the government; that his Majesty was pleased to give the communion plate, surplice and furniture for the communion table and pulpit, with a Bible and Common Prayer books—“so that the service will be performed with decency,” and that the church “is the largest and most complete in the province, and may be an exemplar for building other churches.”\n\nMr. McDowell says that the walls are finished and the roof partly done, and to be finished in the summer, a parsons house to be actually built and a glebe provided, and that Colonel Dry, the Collector, and Mr. Richard Quince, merchant, deserve special mention for their zealous interest in the work. The Governor is to put up a pew for himself and the Council. He has a very good vestry.\n\nIn May, 1761, he says, the church is not done, the old chapel was repaired, and Mr. Dick, the carpenter, who had been working on the Governor's house, was to undertake the work.\n\nIn 1759 an act called the Lottery Act was passed for the benefit of St. James's and St. Philip's parishes, and in 1760 an act was passed appropriating the funds received from the sale of the effects of the Spanish pirates, whose attack on the town is hereinafter described, to the benefit of these churches.\n\n* It was 76½ feet long by 54.8 in. in width, and the height of its walls, as they stand to-day is 34.4. There are 11 windows which measure 15 by 7 feet each, 3 doors, and the thickness of the walls is 33 inches. It was floored with large square bricks, and fitted, as others of its kind, with large square pews. It is the most interesting ruin in the State.\n\nRUINS OF ST. PHILIP'S CHURCH, BRUNSWICK—Interlor\n\nIn April, 1760, the vestry and wardens of St. James parish—John Swann, John Lyon, . . . . . . . . Bishop, Christopher Dudley, and Jonathan Evans—send Mr. McDowell a certificate expressing their satisfaction with his services while in their parish, and Mrs. Allen, then in London, writes to Charleston in his behalf, mentions his singular temperance, his happy disposition, and strong and healthy constitution.\n\nIn November, 1760, he was bereft of wife and child, leaving with him an infant son twelve months old. With his home broken up and increasing responsibilities, he applied to the vestry for increase of salary, to which the vestry, then consisting of John Paine, James Murray, William Dry, Richard Eagles and Robert Snow, reply in a very sharp letter, reminding him that he ought to be able to support himself now with a diminished family on what he had before.\n\nIn July, 1760, just as the church was nearing its completion, in a severe thunder storm it was struck by lightning, and the roof, which had been just finished, all fell down. The chapel which was used is described as a miserable old building, 24 feet by 16 feet, which was drenched by every shower, and the wind blew through it.\n\nMr. McDowell became disheartened and visited Charleston, in hopes of finding a more desirable place, and was offered a parish by the Governor, but, apprehensive of the displeasure of the Society whose aid he was soliciting, returned to Brunswick. He was now 44 years of age, but the exposed life in this new country had impaired his strong constitution. There were 800 taxables in the parish, which included, (except white females) the white, black, and mixed blood over twelve years of age, and among these there were only fifteen communicants, two of whom were black.\n\nIn 1762, the Society at last made Mr. McDowell a missionary, which increased his salary. He had then been in the province nine years, but his ministry was near its close; the strong, vigorous and healthy man had succumbed, and the following year he died. In his will he directed that his body be\n\nburied at the east end of the church near the grave of his wife, Sarah; tradition says that he was buried within the church beneath the altar. He left his infant son to the care of the Governor and his uncle John Grange, and requested that he be brought up under Mr. Richard Quince and sons as a merchant.\n\nIn a letter to the Society announcing his death it was said he was a good man, faithful in his sacred office, and well deserved to be a missionary.\n\nIn 1764 Governor Dobbs wrote to England for a minister, and Rev. Mr. Barnett was sent out in 1765. In the meantime the Governor was in correspondence with Mr. Ichabod Camp, of Middletown, Conn., a missionary who was inclined to come to Carolina if encouraged, but would lose his mission if he should do so without the consent of the Society.\n\nMr. Barnett came after the death of Governor Dobbs, strongly recommended both in England and America, was appointed a missionary to officiate both in St. Philip's and St. James's, as his Excellency Governor Tryon might think proper to direct, and for the first year he resided in the parish of St. James. In 1766, he was removed to Brunswick, and, like his predecessors, extended his services to remote congregations.\n\nThe work on St. Philip's church was renewed with energy. Having suffered by fire in the attack of the Spanish pirates, and the roof having been torn off by a terrible hurricane in 1760, for the third time it was drawing near its completion. The glass and sash arrived in 1766 for the windows, and in June, 1768, it was advanced enough to hold service in.\n\nOn Whit Tuesday, 1768, Rev. Mr. Barnett, assisted by the Rev. Mr. Wills, of St. James's, dedicated the building. Not having a form of service for the occasion, he drew up one.\n\nMr. Barnett was desirous of being inducted into office by letters from the Governor, to secure some certainty of holding his station permanently, which now depended on an annual election by the vestry, but he discovered that the people were violently opposed to induction by the crown, and he shortly\n\nafter resigned and removed to the interior where there was no opposition, and was inducted in a parish in Duplin County.\n\nIn 1768, a young comedian, Mr. Gifford, arrived in Brunswick, and won the respect of the people for his talents and ability. He was recommended to the Governor as a proper person to take orders, and open a school for the youth of the town.\n\nThe Governor, in his letter to the Bishop of London, expressed the opinion that he did not think that the Bishop would like to take an actor into the church, but if he did so it would be the taking off of the best player on the American stage. What became of him we do not know.\n\nNo history of St. Philip's parish would be complete if the name of William Hill should be omitted, for he was the only Lay Reader there, of whom we have any knowledge, and was, perhaps, the most exemplary member of the parish in the performance of his religious duties as the head of a family, and as an officer of the church. He was, consequently, highly esteemed by pious folk, and respected by all who knew him. He was commonly referred to as “the elegant gentleman from Boston.” Josiah Quincy, when on his tour in 1773, mentions being his guest and hearing him read the service at St. Philip's, and characterizes him as “a most sensible, polite gentlemen, and, though a Crown officer, a man replete with sentiments of general liberty and warmly attached to the cause of American freedom”—a tribute fully justified by Mr. Hill's letter to the Safety Committee the next year in regard to the importation of tea, in which he asserted the doctrine that the safety of the people is the supreme law.*\n\nMr. Hill died August 23, 1783, and is buried in St. Philip's churchyard. He left four sons—John, an officer in the Revolution, Nathaniel, a graduate of Edinburgh, and distinguished physician, William Henry, member of Congress and first U. S. District Attorney for North Carolina, and Thomas, a planter, and cultured gentleman.\n\n* See ch. IV, p. 3.\n\nMany of the residents of Brunswick owned plantations in the surrounding country, on which they lived, but spent much of their time in the town. One of the first settlers was Col. John Porter who got a grant for 640 acres below the town, July 14, 1725, and the next year conveyed it to Governor Burrington. This tract on the oldest charts is called Governor's Point, and Sturgeon Point. Governor Burrington, who has been by most writers of North Carolina history unsparingly and bitterly criticised and denounced as possessing no worthy characteristics, was not quite as bad as he was painted, but he was quite an early bird in securing desirable lands, and was frequently engaged in broils with the planters about titles. He was first appointed Governor in 1724 under the Proprietary Government, but was succeeded by Sir Richard Everard in 1725, and then moved from Albemarle to the Cape Fear to look after his landed interests. He went to England in 1730, and the Crown having bought out seven of the eight Proprietors in 1729, he was appointed the first royal Governor in 1730, and came back to North Carolina in 1731. In 1732 he wrote to the Government as follows: “A multitude of people have come into this country to settle last winter. Some have very great American fortunes. I now think there are men here to make up a creditable Council.”*\n\nHaving had a controversy with Col. Maurice Moore about the title to valuable lands at Rocky Point, which the Colonel was ready to settle with guns with which he had armed his retainers, Burrington in 1731, in a dispatch to the Colonial office, tried to square accounts with him by saying: “About 20 men are settled on the Cape Fear from South Carolina—among them are three brothers of a noted family whose name is Moore. These people were always troublesome where they came from, and will doubtless be so here”.† He was justified from a Government standpoint in saying so, for only twelve\n\n* Col. Rec., Vol. III, 344. He was always quarreling with and denouncing members of the Council, and indeed, did not hesitate to characterize as “villains” all who opposed him.† Col. Rec., III, 338.\n\nORTON HOUSE\n\nyears before that time, in 1719, Col. James Moore, the eldest brother of Col. Maurice Moore, led the revolution in South Carolina against the Proprietary Government and was made Governor, as his father had been in 1701, and he was also the grandson of the leader of the Irish rebellion in 1643—a rebellious tribe indeed. Burrington also recommended the establishment of a new town on the Cape Fear to supersede Moore's town of Brunswick, as Governor Johnston did later by the establishment of Wilmington in 1736.\n\nGabriel Johnston succeeded Burrington as Governor and took the oath of office at Brunswick on the 2d November, 1734. Under his administration the Colony generally, and the Cape Fear country especially, prospered. Many settlers came there from different places, bringing retainers and slaves, acquiring valuable lands and adding to the general culture, material and intellectual. They lived in case, with abundance of rural comforts, and dispensed a generous hospitality.\n\nAs illustrative of this hospitality and the mode of life of these early settlers, a pamphlet published in the second volume of the Georgia Historical Collections, entitled “A New Voyage to Georgia,” dated 1734, and written by a young English gentleman who had visited the Cape Fear settlement, says:\n\n“We left Lockwood's Folly about eight the next morning, and by two reached the town of Brunswick, which is the chief town in Cape Fear, but with no more than two of the same horses which came with us out of South Carolina. We dined there that afternoon. Mr. Roger Moore, hearing we had come, was so kind as to send fresh horses for us to come up to his house,* which we did and were kindly received by him, he being the chief gentleman in all Cape Fear. His house is built of brick and exceedingly pleasantly situated about two miles from the town and about half a mile from the river, though there is a creek that comes up close to the door between two beautiful meadows about three miles in length. He has a prospect of the town of Brunswick, and of another beautiful\n\n* Orton.\n\nbrick house,* a building about half a mile from him, belonging to Eleazer Allen, Esq., late speaker to the Commons House of Assembly in the province of South Carolina.\n\n“There were several vessels lying before the town of Brunswick, but I shall forbear giving a description of that place; yet on the 20th June we left Mr. Roger Moore's, accompanied by his brother, Nathaniel Moore, Esq., to a plantation of his up the Northwest branch of the Cape Fear river. The river is wonderfully pleasant, being, next to Savannah, the finest on all the Continent.\n\n“We reached the forks, as they call it, that same night, where the river divides into two very beautiful branches, called the Northeast and Northwest, passing by several pretty plantations on both sides. We lodged that night at one Mr. John Davis's, and the next morning proceeded up the Northwest branch: when we got about two miles from thence we came to a beautiful plantation, belonging to Captain Gabriel,† who is a great merchant there, where were two ships, two sloops, and a brigantine loading with lumber for the West Indies; it is about twenty-two miles from the bar. When we came about four miles higher up we saw an opening on the northwest side of us which is called Black River, on which there is a great deal of very good meadow land, but there is not any one settled on it. The next night we came to another plantation belonging to Mr. Roger Moore, called the Blue Banks, where he is going to build another very large brick house. This bluff is at least one hundred feet high, and has a beautiful prospect over a fine, large meadow on the opposite side of the river; the houses are all built on the west side of the river, it being for the most part high champaign land; the other side is very much subject to overflow, but I can not learn they have lost but one crop. I am creditably informed they have very commonly four score bushels of corn on an acre of their overflowed land. It very rarely overflows, but in the winter time when their crop is off. I must confess that I saw the finest\n\n* Lilliput.† Gabourel—Joshua Gabourel, who came from the Isle of Jersey.\n\ncorn growing there that ever I saw in my life, as likewise wheat and hemp. We lodged there that night at one Captain Gibbs's adjoining Mr. Moore's plantation, where we met with very good entertainment. The next morning we left his house and proceeded up the said river to a plantation belonging to Mr. John Davis, where we dined.\n\n“The plantations on this river are all very much alike as to the situation, but there are many more improvements on some than others; this house is built after the Dutch fashion, and made to front both ways on the river and on the land. He has a beautiful avenue cut through the woods for above two miles, which is a great addition to the house. We left his house about two in the afternoon, and the same evening reached Mr. Nathaniel Moore's plantation, which is reckoned forty miles from Brunswick. It is likewise a very pleasant plantation on a bluff upwards of sixty feet high.”\n\nThis traveler says he did not see “so much as one foot of bad land” after leaving Brunswick. With some of his hosts he visited Waccamaw Lake, of which he said he had heard much and wished to see, and pronounces it “the pleasantest place that ever I saw in my life.” The quantity of game he saw on the trip—deer, turkeys, geese, and ducks—amazed him. After a visit to Rocky Point, which, he says, “is the finest place in all Cape Fear,” and where he was entertained by the leading planters, he returned to South Carolina.\n\nThe Court of Common Pleas was held at Brunswick, and in 1738, according to the Records, it was presided over by Nathaniel Rice, afterwards acting Governor, Matthew Rowan also later the acting Governor, Eleazer Allen, afterwards Chief Justice, James Innes, a distinguished colonel in the French War, Col. Robert Halton, also a distinguished soldier, and Cornelius Harnett, Sr.\n\nWar having been declared between England and Spain in 1740, Governor Johnston was active in raising troops to invade the Spanish Colonies. On the 5th November, 1740, transports left Brunswick with four companies of troops for Florida, of\n\nwhich James Innes was a captain, and these troops formed a part of the regiment commanded by Colonel Gooch, of Virginia, in which Washington's brother Lawrence was an officer. They constituted a part of the expedition from Jamaica to Carthagena, in Central America, under Admiral Vernon, which failed of its object. All that we know of the record of the Cape Fear men engaged in it is that Innes, Lieutenant Benjamin Heron, and Robert Halton were among the officers, and that Heron returned by way of England.\n\nIn 1743 South Carolina asked help to resist the Spanish invasion from Cuba, and it was granted to the extent of 1,000 men, on condition that a North Carolina officer should command them, and Colonel Maurice Moore was chosen for that purpose.* November 8, 1748, an attack on the town was made by two pirate ships, whose captured property was divided between the parishes of St. Philip's at Brunswick and St. James's in Wilmington. A full account of this attack is given in the State Records† and in Ashe's History of North Carolina,‡ from which it appears that in July some of the Spanish ships lay in the harbor of the lower river, watched by a company of militia who then captured six of the Spaniards; that they returned in heavier force September 4th, and the militia again turned out, three of the companies alone containing over 300 troops, but the Spaniards took possession of Brunswick and for four days, from the 6th to the 10th, hostilities were active—that on the 10th one ship was blown up and the other was driven off; that Colonel Dry was employed all that day burying dead Spaniards, and two days later in bringing the spoils from the wreck, and that in addition to the killed and wounded 29 prisoners were taken. In this year the fort at the present town of Southport near the mouth of the Cape Fear, named after the Governor (Johnston), was completed, having been authorized by an Act of 1745. It was commanded in 1755 by Captain John Dalrymple, who was appointed by General Braddock, the ill-fated commander of the expedition against Fort DuQuesne in that year.\n\n* Col. Rec., IV, 633.† Vol. XXII, 286.‡ Vol. I, 270.\n\nIn 1758 it was commanded by Captain James Moore, and from 1766 to 1774 by Captain Robert Howe.\n\nAt the beginning of Johnston's administration, or perhaps before, the merchants of Brunswick found their business hampered by the refusal of raftsmen to carry their tar, timber, naval stores, and other freight down to Brunswick because of the open and exposed water in front of the town, and these merchants were compelled to go up the river to a place called the Dram Tree, about two miles below the present site of Wilmington, to do their trading for these commodities. This was one of the causes of the struggle between Brunswick and Wilmington, then called Newton, for supremacy, which culminated on the 25th February, 1740, when, at a meeting of the council, the bill passed in 1736, making Newton a township to be called Wilmington, was bitterly assailed by Allen, Rice, Moseley and Roger Moore, on the ground that by the Act of 1729 Brunswick was made a township, and empowered to build a court-house, jail and church, that good houses had been built there before Newton was established, and that the custom house, if moved from Brunswick, would be too far up the river, etc. They were opposed by Halton, Rowan, Murray,* and Wm. Smith, the last of whom, after voting as a member and making a tie, as presiding officer cast another vote to break the tie in favor of Wilmington, which was, perhaps, the first time in American history that such an event occurred. Governor Johnston, who had the Act of 1736 (changing the name of Newton to Wilmington) passed in honor of his patron, the Earl of Wilmington, was greatly pleased, and expressed the hope that all public business would be done there. Governor Johnston died in 1752 and was succeeded, first by Nathaniel Rice, President of the Council, who only lived a short time, and then by Matthew Rowan, President of the Council. In 1754 Arthur Dobbs was sent over to be Governor. He was an old gentleman whose previous history\n\n* Murray was made a member of the Council by Governor Johnston suddenly and to accomplish this purpose, as appears from Murray's own statement in a letter to Henry McCulloh, dated 30th January, 1739-40, and this was perhaps the most discreditable act of Governor Johnston during his long and otherwise creditable administration.\n\nwas honorable, but who was unfitted for the duties of his office by reason of his temper and his extravagant notions of the kingly prerogative, and of the duty of subjects of the Crown to submit loyally to all, royal decrees and Acts of Parliament. He remained in authority about ten years, but was in constant disagreement with the Assembly and the people, although he attempted a good many reforms, and tried to do his duty as he saw it. Of him, as of his predecessors and successors, it is not the purpose of this book to give a personal history, but only to state such facts as bear upon the history of New Hanover County under their several administrations.\n\nBurrington, the first royal Governor, did not afflict his soul with anxiety about the spiritual condition of the colonists, but both Johnston and Dobbs did take a deep interest in the religious welfare of the people, and endeavored to awaken a livelier sense of their obligations in that respect than was prevalent among them. Such counsel and action were certainly needed, for there was a very general indifference to, if not a positive disbelief in the truth of Christianity among them at that time. One of Johnston's first appeals to the Legislature was in regard to the lack of religious worship, and also to the need of educational facilities in the province, and Dobbs was really troubled over it, as appears from his frequent references to the subject, and his anxiety to increase the number of ministers, churches and schools. Dobbs resided in Brunswick, but owned a plantation on Town Creek a few miles distant, where there was a large number of other settlers, among whom were the following names: Watters, Dalrymple, Rice, Lewis, Hill, Assup, Bigford, Jean, Ashe, Grange, Neale, Davis, and others.\n\nThe year 1761 was quite an eventful one in the history of Brunswick, although not to be compared with what happened there a few years later. It was in that year that the fearful hurricane* along the coast occurred, which did great damage,\n\n*London Magazine, December, 1761, and Col. Rec., VI, 605.\n\nthrowing down many houses including the roof of the church, driving every ship in the river except one ashore, and forcing open New Inlet—which remained for a hundred years and until after the War between the States (when it was closed by a great engineering feat of the Government)—a chief entrance for ships going to and from Wilmington. At this entrance stood the celebrated Fort Fisher during that war.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Friday, February 6, 1761, at Brunswick, George III was proclaimed King in the presence of the Governor (Dobbs), the Council, and a number of the principal planters and people, an account of which, and of the repetition of the ceremonies the next day at Wilmington, was given by the Governor in a letter to the Board of Trade, dated February 9th.* Nothing after this especially connected with the history of New Hanover County occurred until 1764, when the county of Brunswick was established out of the territory of New Hanover and Bladen, except that in October of that year, because of the continual complaints against the irritable old Governor, the British Ministry sent over Lt.-Col. Wm. Tryon of the Queen's Guards to be Lieutenant Governor, and he took the oaths of office at Wilmington.\n\nIn the latter part of the following March (1765) Governor Dobbs, as Tryon wrote, “retired from the strife and cares of this world,” and Tryon succeeded him as Governor, and qualified on April 3d. It was, for him, an unfortunate time to take charge of the government, for more serious troubles were brewing in the Province than at any previous period—the first being the Stamp Act upheaval, and the next the Regulators War.\n\nTHE STAMP ACT.\n\nIt is pleasant to know that the part taken by the Cape Fear people in the Stamp Act matter, although for a long period preserved only in tradition, has, since the official records were obtained, become familiar history, and that the hoary custom of doubting or denying every creditable even in North Carolina\n\n* Col. Rec., VI, 520.\n\nhistory can no longer be justified, as to these events at least.\n\nThe facts developed by the indisputable records prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the only people in America who resisted with arms the landing of the stamps on their soil, and the first who defied British power with guns in their hands more than ten years before the Declaration of Independence, were the people of the lower Cape Fear.\n\nIt is not my purpose to give an elaborate account of those proceedings, but rather to briefly epitomize the events in the exact order in which they occurred, as follows:\n\nThe Stamp Act was passed by the British Parliament in March, 1765, Tryon succeeded Dobbs on the 3d of April, and the first Assembly after his succession met the 3d of May. Immediately after its meeting, the news of the passage of the act arrived. This event had been anticipated, and Tryon, knowing the popular sentiment and desiring to find out what would be the probable action of the Assembly, in an interview with the speaker (Col. John Ashe) asked him the question, to which Ashe replied that the act would be resisted with arms—or as tradition has preserved his reply, “to blood and death.” Thereupon Tryon on the 18th May prorogued the Assembly to meet at New Bern, November 30th. Then the pot began to boil, meetings were called and resolutions denouncing the act and expressing a determination to resist it were adopted, and these meetings occurred at intervals during the summer and early fall. Dr. Wm. Houston* was appointed to the position of Stamp Master by the Governor and Council. On the 25th October Tryon again prorogued the Assembly until the following March 12th, and this aggravated the situation because it prevented the election of delegates by the Assembly to the Stamp Act Congress, as it has always been called. On the 16th November the people went to Tryon's house in Wilmington and demanded Dr. Houston, the Stamp Master, and upon\n\n* One of Dr. Houston's descendants, Capt. William Houston, a talented young lawyer was a captain of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry, C. S. A., killed in battle.\n\nTryon's refusal to surrender him, they prepared to burn his house. Tryon then requested Colonel Ashe to come in and talk with Houston, which he did, and Houston, realizing his danger, agreed to accompany Ashe to the street, and, escorted by a large crowd, they went to the court-house and there, in the presence of the mayor (Moses John DeRosset) and the public officers, took and subscribed an oath that he would never apply for, or receive any stamp-paper or exercise the duties of his office. Thereupon the crowd gave three cheers and dispersed.\n\nOn the 18th November, two days after this affair, about fifty of the merchants of New Hanover and Brunswick counties, upon invitation from Governor Tryon, dined with him, and he strenuously urged them to permit the circulation of the stamps, but received very cold comfort.\n\nOn the 20th Tryon opened and proclaimed his commission at Wilmington and consulted the Council if any measures could be proposed to induce the people to receive the stamps. “They were unanimously of the opinion that nothing further could be done than what I have already offered,” he wrote to the Secretary of State in England.* Meantime the arrival of the stamps was daily expected at Brunswick, and preparation for their proper reception was made. Tryon was uneasy and anxious to conciliate the people whose good will he desired to cultivate, whose condition he knew to be depressed, and whose spirit he was obliged to respect. In the dispatch just referred to he informed the government that, although the courts had been regularly opened, no business was done, and all civil government was at a stand—that there was little or no specie in circulation, and that the Attorney-General had assured him that the stamp duties on the instruments used in the five Superior Courts alone would in one year require all the specie in the country, and that to these were to be added the instruments used in the twenty-nine inferior or County Courts, those in the hands of the sheriffs and other civil officers, in the Land\n\n* Tryon to Conway, December 26.\n\nOffice, and many others used in the transaction of public business; and he declared his belief that the operation of the Stamp Act was for these reasons impracticable, and therefore he had made proposals for the ease and convenience of the people and tried to reconcile them to the act. There can be no doubt that Tryon regarded the act as outrageously oppressive on the people of the colonies, and would gladly have escaped any connection with it.\n\nOn the 28th November the sloop of war Diligence arrived at Brunswick with the stamps, and was greeted by an assemblage of citizens with guns in their hands. The stamps were not landed. Tryon afterwards wrote that the reason for not landing them was that after Houston resigned there was no distributor or other officer of the stamps in the country and they remained on board, but the true reason was that the gentlemen carrying the guns had “submitted a few broken remarks” concerning the state of heath of any one who should undertake to fetch that part of the cargo ashore.\n\nThe Diligence, either upon her arrival or not long afterwards, was accompanied by the Viper sloop of war, and both lay at anchor off Brunswick awaiting developments.\n\nNothing occurred, except the continued organization of the people in the surrounding country, until the 14th January, 1766, when two merchant vessels, the Dobbs and the Patience, arrived, when it was discovered that their clearance papers were not stamped, whereupon the captain of the Viper immediately seized both vessels, regardless of the assurance of their captains that it was impossible for them to comply with the law, for the reason that when they left Philadelphia and St. Christophers, from which ports respectively they had come, no stamps could be obtained.*\n\n* Since this was written I have had the pleasure of inspecting the long lost and recently found Entry Book of the Port of Brunswick from 1765 to 1774, a very large and much mutilated and stained volume, now owned by Mr. James Sprunt, which contains the entries of the Dobbs and Patience at the custom house at that time, and several times afterward. They are both entered as “Plantation” built. The Dobbs was built in 1763, 40 tons and 4 men, owned by Richard Quince, Eleazer Callender, Master. The Patience, built in 1762, 20 tons and 4 men, owned by William Hawkins, Will Ward, Master. Both were sloops. The sloop Ruby, afterwards seized and released, was also “Plantation” built in 1762, 55 tons and 5 men, owned by Thos. Homer & Co., Thomas Homer, Master, trading to Philadelphia. We also note the “Plantation” built (1764) sloop Charming Peggy, 50 tons and 5 men, owned by Cornelius Harnett. John Cray, Master, and others owned by Cape Fear men.\n\nAnd now the situation became serious indeed. The news of the seizure spread like wildfire and soon five hundred and eighty men with arms, and one hundred without, assembled and chose Col. Hugh Waddell as their commander. On the 16th of February Col. Wm. Dry, Collector of the port of Brunswick, received a letter from Wilmington dated the 15th, demanding his presence there, which he answered promising to be there the next day, but the weather prevented him from going.\n\n“The next intelligence I received,” says Tryon,* “was in the dusk of the evening of the 19th, soon after 6 o'clock, by letter delivered me by Mr. George Moore, and Mr. Cornelius Harnett, bearing date the 19th, and signed “John Ashe, Thomas Lloyd, Alexander Lillington.”\n\nThis letter stirred Tryon to an interview with the captains of the men of war, because it notified him that the people were going to march to Brunswick “in hopes of obtaining in a peaceful manner a redress of their grievances from the commanding officer of his Majesty's ships,” and at the same time assured the Governor of protection from insult to his person and property, and that if agreeable to him, a guard of gentlemen should be immediately detached for that purpose.\n\nTryon, who was a fearless soldier, told Messrs. Moore and Harnett that he wanted no guard, and that the gentlemen need not come to give protection where it was not necessary or required, and that he would answer them in writing next morning.\n\nAs soon as Moore and Harnett left, the house was surrounded by about one hundred and fifty armed men, who informed Tryon that they were looking for Captain Lobb, of the Viper, and on discovering that he was not there the majority of them went toward the town (Tryon's residence being a short distance from it), leaving a number of men to watch the avenues to it.\n\nArmed men, as Tryon wrote, were continualy coming into\n\n* Tryon to Conway, February 25.\n\nBrunswick from different counties, for the whole Cape Fear region was roused.\n\nOn the 20th Pennington, the Comptroller, went to Tryon and told him there had been a search for him also, and Tryon invited him to remain with him, which he did.\n\nThe next morning, the 21st, Col. James Moore went for Pennington, and, being informed by Tryon that he “could not part with him,” Colonel Moore went away, “and in five minutes afterwards,” says Tryon, “I found the avenue to my house again shut up by different parties of armed men.”\n\nAbout 10 o'clock he observed a body of men in arms, estimated by him to be from 400 to 500, moving toward his house, the main body of which drew up in front about 300 yards distant, and a detachment of men advanced down the avenue headed by Harnett, who sent a message that he wished to speak to Pennington, and upon Tryon's statement that Pennington had sought refuge in his house and he would give him all the protection he could. Harnett told him the people were determined to take him out, although they did not intend to harm him. Thereupon Pennington concluded to go with him, but resigned his office to Tryon first. They and the armed citizens then went back to town where Pennington was required to take an oath similar to the one administered to Houston in Wilmington.\n\nOn the evening of the 19th (when George Moore and Harnett went to deliver the note from Ashe, Lloyd and Lillington) Lieutenant Calder, of the Viper, informed the commander of that ship “that a party of men, consisting of three or four hundred under the command of Colonel Waddell were on their march to Fort Johnston, in order to take possession of it,” and thereupon Calder was sent in a boat with orders to spike the guns of the fort, which he did, having reached it before Waddell's column arrived.\n\nIn the meantime the people of Wilmington seized the boat of the contractor for supplies to the men of war at Brunswick, and put its crew in jail. The men of war had only one day's\n\nsupply of provisions on hand, and the only source of supply being thus cut off, Tryon had to yield, and the vessels, which had been seized for the want of stamps on their clearances, were released.\n\nAnd so ended this gallant episode in the early history of the lower Cape Fear.\n\nWe are not willing, however, to close this episode without reciting a ludicrous incident that has been embalmed in the history of that exciting period and may be found in the Colonial Records.*\n\nThe present age is supposed to be par excellence the era of what is called, in the slang of the day, “gall,” but this was an instance of an almost sublime exhibition of it, and is given in a letter from the Rev. John Barnett, minister of St. Philip's church at Brunswick, to a Mr. Waring in London, dated at “Castle Tryon near Brunswick” (Tryon's residence, Russellboro), February 1, 1766, about the time Tryon was in the midst of the Stamp Act troubles.\n\nMr. Barnett was very much exercised over the performances of an individual whom he characterized as “one Stevens, a Scotch Presbyterian teacher” who, he said, was going in the vessel that carried his letter to apply to the Bishop of London for orders as a clergyman; that he had “illused the Governor, affronted all the King's Council (but one Scotch gentleman), most villainously abused me,” and was going to apply for orders without any recommendation to the Bishop; that he “has several times preached here in a lawyer's old gown, given him at Wilmington,” and “has baptized several children in the character of a clergyman of the Church of England, which, before I came, he had the impudence to assume,” and that he had told him (Barnett) that he would make a genteel present to the Bishop and get an order to supersede him (Barnett) as Missionary, and had told some of the Council that “any one might get orders on making a Bishop a present of the price of a good beaver hat, which he intended doing”;\n\n* VI, 161.\n\nthat he “came to Brunswick a distressed stranger and the Governor had taken pity on him and given him 50 guineas, but had found him out and had forbidden him his presence.”\n\nPoor Tryon was certainly having a rough experience about that time, and brother Barnett was evidently sorely grieved in spirit at such a manifestation of wickedness and irreverence for church dignitaries—irrespective, of course, of any personal anxiety in regard to his own tenure of office.\n\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act and the generous proclamation of Governor Tryon announcing the fact and warning the public officers to refrain from further extortions upon the people, were acceptable to the conservative element who still cherished the hope of a satisfactory adjustment of affairs, but there was a feeling of unrest and distrust prevalent, and the enforcement of the Navigation Act, which forbade the carriage of anything to European ports north of Cape Finisterre, except the one article of rice, they felt was a discrimination against them like that against Ireland, and they naturally resented it. Soon after this the Regulators movement in the middle of the State began, and although the people of the Cape Fear regarded Governor Tryon as disposed to be tyrannical, they regarded the Regulators as the organizers of a mobocracy, and sustained the Governor as the representative of orderly government by contributing troops to aid him in his effort to suppress them. The history of the Regulators war is familiar to all, and therefore we give no further space to it, except to say that New Hanover County contributed a company of artillery under Col. James Moore and John B. Ashe. They had proved their devotion to liberty by their armed resistance to the Stamp Act, but with an intelligent appreciation of the difference between asserting their rights as British subjects, and countenancing lawlessness and anarchy, while reluctant to antagonize with arms their countrymen, they felt that it was their duty to stand for law and order and sustain even a government which was not acceptable to themselves against mob violence, and the domination of ignorant and fanatical demagogues.\n\nThe new town of Wilmington, from its establishment in 1736, had outgrown Brunswick, and at the time of the Stamp Act troubles contained more than twice as many inhabitants, and when the Revolution began had more than three times as many. It accordingly became the chief center of events after that time, while Brunswick continued to decline and soon ceased to exist as a town, although a good many of its former inhabitants continued to use the old church yard of St. Philip's for the burial of their dead. Most of the dead, however, were buried on the plantations, as required by the Act of 1741, which made it the duty of every planter to set apart a burying ground for dead Christians, free and bond.\n\nThus ended the history of the second settlement on the Cape Fear, which began with every promise of becoming both the permanent seat of government and the leading commercial mart of the Province of North Carolina. For nearly a hundred years after its abandonment, it remained a decayed and melancholy relic, hidden among the moss-draped pines and undergrowth that crowned the bluff on which it was built, and by which swept silently the wide, historic river, until the beginning of the War between the States in 1861, when a great earthwork fortification, Fort Anderson, was erected on the site, enclosing with one of its arms the walls of the old church, which, again as of old, was bombarded by a hostile fleet, and again, as if under divine protection, escaped destruction or serious injury, and still stands old and gray in a new-grown forest, and amid crumbling tombs.\n\nSONS OF LIBERTY.\n\nDuring the excitement over the Stamp Act in the fall of 1765 and before the arrival of the Diligence with the stamps, the people of the Cape Fear in common with the people every where throughout the country began to organize themselves under the name “Sons of Liberty,” and that organization continued under that title until after the year 1770, but how long after that date we do not know, although it is probable that\n\nafter the formation of Safety Committees in 1774, the name ceased to be used.\n\nAt a meeting held June 2, 1770, a general committee was appointed, as appears from the following extract from the South Carolina Gazette of July 5th:\n\n“We hear that in consequence of a letter addressed to the Sons of Liberty in North Carolina, under cover to Col. James Moore, a meeting has been appointed, and held on the 2d of last month, where a number of gentlemen from the several southern counties in that Province were chosen as a committee to meet at Wilmington on this day, to consult upon such measures as may appear most eligible, for evincing their Patriotism and Loyalty in the Present critical situation of affairs; which committee are, Col. Thomas Lloyd, Cornelius Harnett, Frederick Gregg, William Campbell, Esq., Messrs. John Robinson and William Wilkinson, for the town of Wilmington—George Moore, Frederick Jones, Esqs., Col. James Moore, Messrs. Samuel Ashe and James Naran [Moran] for New Hanover County—Richard Quince, Sen., and Richard Quince, Jun., Esqrs., and Mr. Wilkinson, for the town of Brunswick—John and William Davis, Esqrs., Messrs. Samuel Watters, Thomas Davis, and Samuel Neal, for Brunswick County—Messrs. John and George Gibbs, and John Grange, Jun., for Bladen County—Col. James Sampson, and Felix Keenan [Kenan], Esq., for Duplin County—William Gray, Henry Roads [Rhodes], and Richard Ward, Esqrs., for Onslow County—and Walter Gibson, Farquhar Campbell, and Robert Rowan, Esqrs., for Cumberland County.”\n\nAnd again, on the 5th of July, according to a publication in the same paper of August 9th, there was a meeting of which the following account is given:\n\n“At a meeting of the General Committee of the Sons of Liberty upon Cape Fear, in Wilmington the 5th of July, Cornelius Harnett, Esq., was chosen Chairman, and the following Resolutions unanimously agreed on, viz:\n\n“I. Resolved, That the following answer to the letter received\n\nfrom the Sons of Liberty in South Carolina, of the 25th of April last, be signed by the Chairman and sent by the first conveyance:\n\nTo the Sons of Liberty in South Carolina.\n\nGENTLEMEN:—Your favor of the 25th of April last was laid before the Sons of Liberty upon Cape Fear, at a general meeting in this town, on the second of last month, and received with the highest satisfaction.\n\nWe have the pleasure to inform you, that many of the principal inhabitants of six large and populous counties attended when it was unanimously agreed, to keep strictly to the non-importation agreement entered into last fall, and to cooperate with our sister colonies, in every legal measure for obtaining ample redress of the grievance so justly complained of.\n\nHappy should we have thought ourselves, if our merchants in general, would have followed the disinterested and patriotic example of their brethren in the other colonies. We hope, however, their own interest will convince them of the necessity of importing such articles, and such only, as the planters will purchase.\n\nWe should have done ourselves the pleasure of answering your letter much sooner, but the gentlemen of the committee living at such a distance from each other prevented it.\n\nWe beg leave to assure you, that the inhabitants of those six counties, and we doubt not of every county in this colony, are convinced of the necessity of adhering strictly to their former resolutions, and you may depend they are as tenacious of their just rights as any of their brethren on the continent and firmly resolved to stand or fall with them in support of the common cause of American liberty.\n\nWorthless men, as you very justly observe, are the production of every country, and we are also unhappy as to have a few among us “who have not virtue enough to resist the alurement of present gain.” Yet we can venture to assert, that the people in general of this colony, will be spirited and steady in support of their rights as English subjects, and will not tamely submit to the yoke of oppression—“But, if by the iron hand of power,” they are at last crushed, it is, however, their fixed resolution, either to fall with the same dignity and spirit you so justly mention, or transmit to their posterity entire, the inestimable blessings of our free Constitution.\n\nThe disinterested and public spirited behavior of the merchants and other inhabitants of your colony, justly merits the applause of every lover of liberty on the continent. The people of any colony who have not virtue enough to follow so glorious examples must be lost to every sense\n\nof freedom and consequently deserve to be slaves. We are, with great truth, gentlemen.\n\nYour affectionate countrymen,\n\nCORNELIUS HARNETT, Chairman.\n\nSigned by order of the General Committee, Wilmington, Cape Fear, July 5th, 1770.\n\n“II. Resolved, That we will strictly and inviolably adhere to the non-importation agreement entered into on the 30th day of September last, until the grievances therein mentioned are redressed.\n\n“III. Resolved, That we will not, on any pretense whatever, have any dealings or connection with the inhabitants of the colony of Rhode Island, who contrary to their solemn and voluntary contract, have violated their faith pledged to the other colonies, and thereby shamefully deserted the common cause of American liberty, and if any of their vessels or merchants shall arrive in Cape Fear River, with intention to trade, we will to the utmost of our power by all legal ways and means prevent any person buying from, or selling to them, any goods or commodities whatever, unless they give full satisfaction to the colonies for their base and unworthy conduct.\n\n“IV. Resolved, That the merchants of Newport, Rhode-Island, and all others on the continent of North America, who will not comply with the non-importation agreement are declared enemies to their country, and ought to be treated in the most contemptuous manner.\n\n“V. Resolved, That we will not purchase any kind of goods or merchandise, whatever, from any merchant or other person who shall import or purchase goods for sale contrary to the spirit and intention of the said agreement, unless such goods be immediately re-shipped to the place they were imported from, or stored under the inspection and direction of the Committee.\n\n“VI. Resolved, That the members of the committee for the several counties in the Wilmington District, and particularly those for the towns of Wilmington and Brunswick, do carefully\n\ninspect all importations of goods, and if any shall be imported contrary to the true intent and meaning of the said non-importation agreement, that they give public notice thereof in the Cape Fear Mercury, with the names of such importers or purchasers.\n\n“VII. Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be immediately transitted to all the trading towns in this colony.”\n\nThe Committee of the Sons of Liberty upon Cape Fear, appointed for the town of Wilmington to inspect into all goods imported, take this opportunity to inform the public, that Mr. Arthur Benning of Duplin County hath imported in the sloop Lancashire Witch from Virginia, a small assortment of goods, several articles of which are not allowed by the non-importation agreement. But it appears at the same time to the Committee, those goods were expected to arrive before the first day of January last, having been ordered by Mr. Benning some time in July last, his correspondent sent them to Virginia, where they have lain a considerable time since.\n\n“We have the pleasure to inform the public, that Richard Quince, Esq., a member of the general committee, and who may with great propriety be deemed a principal merchant, hath joined heartily in the non-importation agreement. It will, no doubt, be looked upon as a very great misfortune to this country, that some merchants and others seem resolved not to follow so disinterested an example, but on the contrary, are daily purchasing wines and many other articles contrary to the said agreement. Should those gentlemen still persist in a practice so destructive in its tendency to the liberties of the people of this colony, they must not be surprised, if hereafter the names of the importers and purchasers should be published in Cape Fear Mercury. This is intended to serve as a friendly admonition. And, it is hoped will be received as such, and have its due effect.”\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE NAMES OF THE EARLIEST PLANTATIONS, THEIR LOCATION\n\nAND THEIR OWNERS, WITH ITEMS OF\n\nBIOGRAPHY AND INCIDENTS.\n\nAs already stated, settlements were made on the Cape Fear River, and in its vicinity as early as 1723. A grant for 48,000 acres was made to Landgrave Thomas Smith* as early as 1713, but no attempt to settle on that grant (which included Bald Head at the mouth of the river and extended above Wilmington) was made for some years. These settlements were chiefly on the west side of the river below Wilmington, and in the locality known then and ever since as Rocky Point on the northeast branch above Wilmington, but some were on the sound and on the upper Northwest river. There were a few grants for land as far south and west of the river as Lockwood's Folly, but these were isolated places to which no historic interest attaches.\n\nWe will begin our account of these oldest plantations and their owners by first taking those farthest down the river and proceeding up it as high as Wilmington, and then take those above on both branches in the same order, and finally those on the sound.\n\nAnd, as preliminary to the subject, it will be “news” to the present generation of Cape Fear people to learn that in the early days fine crops of wheat were raised in the Rocky Point neighborhood on the northeast branch of the river. In those days rice, indigo, corn, and tobacco were the principal crops, but there is contemporary evidence of the culture of wheat also in the region referred to, and probably in many other places. In a letter written by a lady from her residence near Castle Haynes to Mr. John Burgwin in London, in the year 1775 (August 25th), is this language: “We have prodigious crops of wheat this year—better never known in the memory of men. The corn will also be very fine if these deluges of rain do not spoil it.”\n\n* A recital in a deed (N. H. Records, C. 77) says this grant is in the Secretary's office of South Carolina.\n\nPlantations on the Lower Cape Fear 1725 to 1760\n\nIn speaking of the British troops grinding grain at Rutherford's mills, above Rocky Point in 1781, McRee* says: “With the exception of a small experiment by Dr. J. F. McRee on Rocky Point, wheat has not been cultivated in that region since the Revolution.” The reason, or one of the reasons, probably was that after that time it was found to be cheaper to buy flour brought from the back country to Fayetteville, and thence by boat to Wilmington, than to raise the wheat and send it miles away to be ground on toll at the few mills that were equipped with proper stones for grinding that grain. It certainly was not because the land was not capable of producing fine wheat crops.\n\nGOVERNOR'S POINT.\n\nThe southernmost estate on the river was called Governor's Point because Governor Burrington bought it from the first grantee, John Porter. John Porter came from the Albemarle region, where he had been for many years a leader of the people. He moved to the Cape Fear country in 1723 and died at Rocky Point in 1734. Members of his family intermarried with the Moores, Ashes, Lillingtons, and Moseleys.\n\nIn a lecture delivered before the Historical and Scientific Society of Wilmington, on the 26th of November, 1879, entitled “A Study in Colonial History,” the Hon. George Davis overwhelmingly vindicated the memory of Porter from the grossly unjust attacks upon it by Dr. Hawks and other writers of our colonial history. Under his claim, clear and masterful analysis of the facts concerning the Cary rebelion and the characters connected with it—an analysis illuminated by flashes of satire and genial humor—the true character and valuable services of John Porter were portrayed, and his claim to the admiration and respect of posterity was triumphantly established. Like too many others who have lived in troublous times, and have taken an active part in public affairs, Porter was the victim of party rancor and the personal hostility of those in authority who used their power to defame him and destroy his influence and reputation, but it was almost worth\n\n* Life and Correspondence of James Iredell, Vol. I, 526, note.\n\nundergoing the wrong and injustice to have received after many years such a splendid vindication as the lecturer pronounced.\n\nHOWE'S POINT.\n\nJob Howe, father of Gen. Robert Howe of Revolutionary fame, was the son of a prominent man of the same name in South Carolina, and was the grandson of Governor James Moore (the first) of that State. His residence at Howe's Point, the next place above Governor's Point, was in rear of an old colonial fort, built, according to tradition, for defense against pirates who infested the harbor and river, and the ruins of both his residence and the fort were visible until a comparatively recent period.\n\nIn his interesting little book, entitled “Tales and Traditions of the Lower Cape Fear,” Mr. James Sprunt says: “Mr. Reynolds, the present intelligent owner and occupant of the Howe place behind the colonial fort, who took part in building Fort Anderson, says that his father and his grandfather informed him forty years ago that this fort was erected long before the War of the Revolution as a protection against buccaneers and pirates; that his great-grandfather lived with General Howe on this place during the war (Revolution) and took part in a defense of this fort against the British who drove the Americans out of it; that the latter retreated to Libery Pond, about a half mile in the rear, pursued by the British; that a stand was made at this pond, the Americans on the west and the enemy on the east side, and that the blood which flowed stained the margin of the beautiful sheet of water which still bears the name of Liberty Pond, and that the Americans again retreated as far as McKenzie's mill dam behind Kendall, where the British abandoned the pursuit and returned to their ships of war.”\n\nAnd Mr. Sprunt adds: “Since the foregoing was written Mr. Reynolds's statement with reference to General Howe's residence has been fully corroborated by the well-known Cape Fear skipper, Captain Sam Price, now eighty-six years old.\n\nHe remembers distinctly and has often visited the house known as General Howe's residence, which he says was a large three-story frame building, on a stone or brick foundation, on the spot already described just below Old Brunswick, and still known as Howe's Point.” General Howe was one of the really brilliant officers of the Revolution, having been promoted to the rank of Major General in October, 1777, although his advancement had been most ungenerously obstructed by persons in South Carolina and Georgia. He was a man of much more than usual culture and ability, and who, by his intelligent activity in supporting the rights of the people against the unconstitutional aggression of King and Parliament before the Revolution broke out, had become so obnoxious to the Government that when pardon was offered to all who would abandon the American cause during the war, he and Harnett, who was his close friend and coadjutor, were specifically excepted from clemency, and his plantation was plundered by a British expedition. It would require a volume to adequately present his most valuable services to his country from early manhood to the day of his death, which occurred in December, 1786, at the residence of his friend and brother hero, Gen. Thomas Clark, at Point Repose, while on his way to attend the session of the Legislature, of which he was a member, then assembled at Fayetteville. We shall have occasion to refer again to this brave and gifted soldier and patriot, and therefore postpone further comment now.\n\nYORK.\n\nThe place next above Howe's Point, and just below the town of Old Brunswick, belonged to Nathaniel Moore,* a brother of Col. Maurice Moore and “King” Roger Moore, but he owned several other plantations up the river and does not seem to have lived at York. There is, or recently was, a steamboat landing and post-office about forty miles farther up the river that has for more than a hundred years borne the name of “Nat Moore,” but generally spelled Natmore.\n\n* Nathaniel Moore married Sarah Grange April 13, 1720, in South Carolina, as we learn from the Annals and Register of St. Thomas's and St. Denis's Parish, S. C., and after her death married a Miss Webb.\n\nRUSSELLBORO.\n\nImmediately north of the town of Brunswick was the historic place called Russellboro, a residence with 55 acres of land attached, which was bought from Roger Moore's estate by Captain Russell of the British navy,* and afterwards was sold to Governor Dobbs, whose son, Captain Edward Brice Dobbs, sold it to Governor Tryon in 1767.† It was at this residence that the Stamp Act patriots interviewed Tryon to his great indignation and humiliation. As in nearly every other instance of the places, there is nothing left of Russellboro but a few broken bricks.‡ It was a part of the Orton estate.\n\nORTON.\n\nThe first plantation above Brunswick, which from its first settlement to this day has been one of the largest and most beautiful estates on the Cape Fear River, is Orton. It was settled by “King” Roger Moore in 1725, and remained in his family for three generations, and then was bought by Richard Quince, a wealthy merchant, in whose family it remained for about thirty years, when Gen. (afterwards Governor) Benjamin Smith owned it. It was the southernmost rice plantation on the river.\n\nKENDALL.\n\nAdjoining Orton on the north is Kendall, where Governor Smith's brother James lived. He was the father of R. Barnwell Smith, who, with his brother, took the name of Rhett and moved to South Carolina. Kendall was first granted to Col. Maurice Moore in 1725, conveyed by him to his brother Roger Moore in 1726, and sold by the latter's son George to John Davis, Jr., in 1765.§ It was later owned by the McRee\n\n* Captain Russell owned the land on which the town of Campbellton (adjoining Cross Creek, now Fayetteville) was built, which land descended to his sons John and William, who are named as the owners in the Act of 1762 establishing the town, and who were pensioned by the British government, and were Tories in the Revolution. Their father died prior to 1762, and Andrew J. Howell, Esq., of Wilmington, tells me he is one of his descendants. Captain Russell commanded the sloop of war Scorpion.† Book B, 309, N. H.‡ The North Carolina Society of Colonial Dames have erected, with the foundation stones of the building, a memorial structure, and have placed on it a large marble tablet reciting the history of the place.§ Book E, 242.\n\nfamily. The first of this family in North Carolina was Samuel McRee, who settled in Bladen County about the year 1740, having come from Ireland. His son, Griffith John McRee, born in Bladen February 1, 1758, was an enthusiastic patriot at the beginning of the Revolution, and was commissioned on the 16th of April, 1776, captain in the 6th Regiment, Continental Line of North Carolina. He was at the battle of Fort Moultrie, and afterwards at the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. Being transferred in March, 1779, to the 1st Regiment, Continental Line, he marched in the next fall to South Carolina, and was at the long siege of Charleston, where he was made prisoner. After his exchange he joined Greene's army and fought at Guilford Court House, Hobkirk's Hill, and Eutaw Springs. In the last named fight his conduct secured his promotion to the rank of Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel. After the Revolution, in 1785, he married Miss Fergus, of Wilmington, and lived at Lilliput, next adjoining to Kendall. General Washington appointed him Captain of Engineers and Artillery in 1794, and while in command at Fort Johnston he was appointed, in 1798, collector of the port of Wilmington. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati and was distinguished for his exceptional Christian character. Only five of his children reached maturity, but of these, three were men of marked ability, viz: Col. Wm. McRee, who graduated at West Point in 1805 with the first honors, distinguished himself in the War of 1812, was made Chief of Engineers U. S. Army in 1814, Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers in 1818, resigned 1819, and died in 1833. Also Col. Sam McRee, who graduated at West Point, reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Mexican War as General Taylor's Chief Quartermaster, and died in 1849; and Dr. James Fergus McRee, perhaps the most learned, scholarly and accomplished physician and scientist ever reared on the Cape Fear. He was distinguished for his attainments in natural science as well as in the different branches of his profession and in general literature, and was a correspondent of the Royal Society\n\nand a friend of the celebrated Lyell, who with his wife once visited Dr. McRee at his Rocky Point plantation. He was an upright gentleman and devoted Christian, who, after a life of nearly seventy-five years crowned with honors, died in 1869 at his home in Wilmington. He had two sons who sustained the intellectual reputation of the family, viz: Dr. James F. McRee, Jr., a prominent physician and surgeon in the Confederate army, and Griffith J. McRee, author of the “Life and Correspondence of James Iredell,” Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nLILLIPUT.\n\nThe plantation next north of Kendall was Lilliput, which was granted in 1725 to Eleazer Allen, an educated gentleman and native of Massachusetts, who had previously been a member of the Assembly in South Carolina, and a member of the Council there, and who came with the early settlers from there in 1734. He lived at Lilliput until his death in 1749, and, with his wife,* is buried on that place under two of the best preserved tombstones on the Cape Fear. The stone over his remains is inscribed “Chief Justice of North Carolina.” He had also been a member of Council, Receiver-General, Judge of Oyer and Terminer, and Treasurer of New Hanover precinct. Lilliput was afterwards owned by the McRee family, as above stated.\n\nPLEASANT OAKS.\n\nNext above Lilliput was the plantation called Pleasant Oaks, granted to the widow of John Moore, (another brother of Maurice and Roger) in 1728, and from whom it is believed that the “Widow Moore's Creek,” where the first victory of the Revolution (February 27, 1776) was won, took its name.†\n\nOLD TOWN CREEK.\n\nThis list of the plantations brings us up to the mouth of Old Town Creek, on the western bank of the river, about eight\n\n* A lady of culture, who had traveled in Europe, a daughter of Col. William Rhett, of South Carolina.† She was, before marriage, Justina Smith, daughter of Landgrave Thomas Smith the second, and died in Philadelphia after a brief illness while on a visit to relatives in 1742. Her will is recorded in Philadelphia.\n\nmiles below Wilmington, where the colony of Sir John Yeamans settled the first Charlestown in this country, in 1664-65.\n\nRICE'S PLANTATION.\n\nNow, leaving the river and following up Old Town Creek, one of the plantations on the south side, was that of Nathaniel Rice, the remains of the fine residence there having been visible as late as the early youth of the late Hon. Geo. Davis, who said he had seen them.* Nathaniel Rice was the son-in-law of Col. Martin Bladen, one of the Lords of Trade and Plantations, and was a prominent man in the Province, having been first the Secretary of the Province and later a member of the Council and acting Governor for a short period, just before Matthew Rowan, the next senior member of the Council, who succeeded him until the arrival of Governor Dobbs in 1754.\n\nThe order in which the plantations up Old Town Creek came is not known, and we can only give the names of a few of them.\n\nSPRING GARDEN.\n\nIn a deed from Maurice Moore to John Baptista Ashe, dated December 5, 1727, in which Moore is described as “of Bath County,” he conveys 640 acres on the north side of Old Town Creek, “about five miles above ye Old Town, commonly known by the name of Spring Garden,” granted to said Moore, June 20, 1725. The name of this place was afterwards changed by some of Mr. Ashe's successors to Grovely, by which name it has been known for more than a hundred years past. It was given, by the will of Ann R. Quince, to her cousin, A. D. Moore, son of Maj. A. D. Moore, and for sixty years or more last past has belonged to the estate of the late Dr. John D. Bellamy.\n\nBELGRANGE.\n\nAnother plantation, on Old Town Creek, containing 2,500 acres, was owned by Chief Justice Hasell and was conveyed to James Murray, Trustee, in a marriage settlement between\n\n* “An Episode in Cape Fear History,” in South Atlantic Magazine, January, 1879.\n\nHasell's son, James Hasell, Jr., and Sarah Wright, February 20, 1750,* and this place was called Belgrange.\n\nHULLFIELDS.\n\nNext to Belgrange was Hullfields, owned by Schencking Moore, son of Nathaniel Moore, and sold by him to John McKenzie.\n\nDAVIS PLANTATION.\n\nAnother place at the head of Old Town Creek, containing 750 acres, was sold by Eleazer Allen to John Davis, June 9, 1744.\n\nDALYRMPLE PLACE.\n\nAnother place “on the north side of Old Town Creek, adjoining the land of the late John Baptista Ashe at Spring Garden,” containing 550 acres, was sold by the executors of Joseph Watters to “John Dalrymple, Gent.,† September 12, 1744.‡\n\nDOBBS PLACE.\n\nGovernor Dobbs owned a plantation on Old Town Creek, where he is supposed to have been buried, but its name and locality are unknown, and the same may be said of most of the plantations located there, of which there were a dozen or more.\n\nThe best known of these proprietors, except Dobbs, was John Baptista Ashe, who was the father of Col. John Ashe of Stamp Act fame, and of Governor Samuel Ashe. He went from South Carolina to the Albemarle country, where in 1719 he married the daughter of Samuel Swann, and afterwards removed with his relatives, Porter, Moseley, Moore, and Lillington, to the Cape Fear and took up his residence at Spring Garden in 1727, where he died in 1734.\n\n* Book D, 188, N. H.† Afterwards (in 1755) commander of Fort Johnston. His brother (?) Sir Wm. Dalrymple, married Miss Martha Watters, sister of Joseph Watters. Captain Dalrymple had trouble with Governor Dobbs, was removed from command of the fort, and was succeeded (1758) by Captain (afterwards general) James Moore.‡ Book C, 32, N. H.OLD TOWN.\n\nReturning now to the mouth of Old Town Creek and proceeding north on the river, the first place is the site of the Old Town, which still retains its name of the Old Town plantation. In 1761 Judge Maurice Moore, son of Col. Maurice Moore, bought this plantation from his brother Gen. James Moore, and in 1768 sold it to John Ancrum, one of the early settlers and a prominent man, who was a leading merchant, chairman (after Harnett) of the Safety Committee, and one of its most active members from the start.\n\nCLARENDON.\n\nThe place next north of Old Town was called Clarendon, and still retains the name. Who gave it the name we do not know, but it was owned by Mr. Campbell at an early period, and afterwards by Mr. Joseph Watters.\n\nTHE FORKS.\n\nNext above Clarendon was the estate called the Forks, which was owned by Richard Eagles in 1736, and was afterwards bought by John Davis, Esq., and later by Mr. Joseph Eagles. Richard and Joseph Eagles were among the first settlers on the Cape Fear. Their descendants were prominent, but the family is now extinct. They came from Bristol, and it is a remarkable fact that this writer some years ago, being introduced to a Mr. Eagles living about 25 miles from Wilmington, upon inquiry discovered that he had come with the Northern army which captured Fort Fisher in 1865, had never heard of the Old Cape Fear family, was an Englishman, was from Bristol, and was named Richard!\n\nBUCHOI.\n\nThe next place was Buchoi, owned by Judge Alfred Moore. The origin of this name puzzled the present writer because he knew that while there was a number of French names, then fashionable for estates, Judge Moore would not have written the name Buchoi (intending Beauchoix) but his puzzle was\n\nsolved when he discovered several years ago, that one of the old Moore estates on Goose Creek, S. C., bore an Indian name which was spelled in the records there Boo-Chawee, the spelling in both cases being according to the sound, or, in modern phrase, phonetic.\n\nBELVILLE.\n\nAdjoining Buchoi was Belville, owned by Mr. John Waddell,* son of Gen. Hugh Waddell, who also owned three other plantations farther up the river.\n\nBELVIDERE.\n\nThen came Belvidere, owned by Col. Wm. Dry, and later by Governor Ben Smith. This place is nearly opposite the City of Wilmington, but intervening is Eagles’ Island, formed by the cut-off now called Brunswick River, but in the earliest period called the Northwest or main branch, which latter was then called the Thoroughfare.\n\nThis completes the list of places on the west side of the river from below Brunswick to the forks of the river at Wilmington, all of which except those on upper Old Town Creek, were rice plantations with large tracts of timber land adjoining them to the westward.\n\nNEGRO HEAD POINT.\n\nBetween the forks of the river opposite Wilmington was the Negro Head Point plantation which at an early period belonged to Col. Peter Mallett, and from his time to the present has been called Point Peter.\n\nThe name of this place has long been erroneously supposed to have been given to it from the fact that a negro's head was\n\n* Mr. Waddell used to tell of an incident that happened not far from this plantation during Craig's occupation of Wilmington. He was a little boy eleven years old at the time, and was being carried by his guardian, Mr. John Burgwin, to Charleston to be sent to school in England, where his two elder brothers were. A sentinel halted the vehicle and demanded Mr. Burgwin's pass, which he received and solemnly inspected and returned, saying it was all right. After passing, Mr. Burgwin began to laugh heartily, and the little boy asked the reason, to which he replied that the sentinel held the pass upside down while pretending to read it. Mr. Waddell also related that when the ship that carried him to England was entering the Thames a great ship, called the Royal George, hailed, and asked, “what news from America,” to which the answer was shouted: “A great victory for His Majesty's troops at Guilford Court House.” Mr. Waddell married Sarah, daughter of Gen. Francis Nash.\n\nsaid to have been stuck up there at the time of the Nat Turner insurrection in 1831, but this is a mistake, for the point was called Negro Head Point in court records as early as the year 1764. How it originated is not known.\n\nThere is a similar error as to the name of the stream called Jumping Run, just below Wilmington, which has long been attributed to an alleged incident of the American Revolution, but that name also appears in court records more than ten years before the Revolution.\n\nNow, beginning at Wilmington and going up the Northeast River, the first place was Hilton, owned by Cornelius Harnett, “the pride of the Cape Fear.”\n\nHILTON.\n\nThere has been much misinformation about this place. As early as June 3d, 1730, in a deed from John Gardner Squier* to John Maultsby for land on Smith's Creek, he described it as “adjoining Harnett's,” showing that Cornelius Harnett, Senior, owned it at that time, for then the younger Harnett was only seven years old. About that time the elder Harnett had a ferry at Maultsby's Point. The land was called Maynard by Harnett, and the name Hilton was not given to it until the widow of C. Harnett, Jr., conveyed it to John Hill and he sold it to his brother, Wm. H. Hill, who says in his will that he named it Hilton after his family, although in doing so he left out one L, and thus gave color to the tradition that it was named after the first explorer in 1663, Captain Hilton.\n\nHALTON LODGE.\n\nAdjoining the Hilton estate on the east and fronting on Smith's Creek (which was named for Chief Justice Smith, who owned land at the head of it) was Halton Lodge, owned by Col. Robert Halton, one of the founders of Wilmington. This place was between where the county road and the present track\n\n* A. B. 161. Squier got a grant for the Hilton tract November 5, 1728. It was conveyed by Wm. Moore to C. Harnett, Jr., (150 acres) May 3, 1753; so that the elder Harnett must have sold or mortgaged it before his son bought it from Wm. Moore.\n\nof the A. C. L. R. R. cross the creek, and contained 640 acres. It subsequently bore several names.* It was sold under execution by Arthur Benning, Sheriff, on the 14th October, 1765, to satisfy a debt to Caleb Grainger, administrator of Joshua Grainger, and was bought by Cornelius Harnett, Jr., for nine pounds proclamation money. It was stated in the Sheriff's deed that the property was in possession of “John Rutherford, surviving administrator of Robert Halton.”\n\nOf the history of Colonel Halton prior to the year 1730 we have no knowledge. In that year Burrington recommended him for a seat in the council, and he served both under him and under Governor Johnston. He was also Provost Marshal (changed by the Act of 1738, Ch. 3, to Sheriff) of Bath County. Probably on the suggestion of Burrington, who had located patents there, he removed to the Cape Fear about 1734, and was one of the original settlers at Wilmington.† He was an officer of the troops that left the Cape Fear on the expedition to Carthagena in 1740.\n\nSANS SOUCI.\n\nThe plantation next north of Hilton has for a hundred years borne the name Sans Scuci, which was probably given it by one of the Hill family, but the original owner was Caleb Grainger, Sr.\n\nCaleb Grainger, Sr., was the son of Joshua Grainger, one of the founders (1733) of Wilmington, then called Newtown. He early took an active and prominent part in public affairs, being a member of the Assembly in 1746, and Sheriff of the county in 1749. In the numerous deeds recorded in the county from him he signs himself as planter, inn-holder, and esquire.\n\nHe was Lieutenant Colonel of Innes's regiment on the expedition to Virginia in 1754, the other officers being Robt. Rowan, Major, and Thos. Arbuthnot, Edward Vail, Alex.\n\n* D 488. It seems most probable that this was the “Poplar Grove” from which Harnett dated all his published letters. Poplar Grove was certainly not the same as Hilton (called Magnard by Harnett), for Harnett applied for permission for his “negro man Jack to carry a gun on his two plantations, Maynard and Poplar Grove.”† Colonel Halton owned Eagles’ Island, opposite Wilmington, and sold half of it to Roger Moore December 13, 1737.\n\nWoodrow, Hugh Waddell, Thos. McManus, and Moses John DeRosset, Captains. Upon the reorganization of the regiment after Braddock's defeat (1755) he went on the expedition to New York (1756) as a Captain under Major Dobbs, son of the Governor, and for some years afterwards was prominent in civil life.\n\nHe was a large landholder and was described by Governor Dobbs as a “gentleman of good fortune in the province.” He was a prominent Mason, and having bought from George Moore the land on which Masonboro was settled, is believed to have given it that name, as the first deed in which the name is mentioned was made by his widow and executrix. He died in 1769 or 1770.\n\nROCK HILL.\n\nThen came Rock Hill, the residence of John Davis, Esq., who also owned the Mulberry plantation on the Northwest River, or main branch.\n\nROSE HILL.\n\nThen came Rose Hill, the residence of Mr. Quince, a member of one of the oldest families on the Cape Fear.

The “Annals” of this family have been recently published in a beautiful volume:\n\nAbout 1735 there arrived in Wilmington from England a gentleman with his wife and two sons, whose name from that time to the present has been an honored one on the Cape Fear, Dr. Armand DeRosset. He was descended from three noble\n\nfamilies of France and was a distinguished graduate of the University of Basle, Switzerland, from which he received his medical diploma in 1720; but being a Huguenot and son of an exile he neither assumed nor claimed any right to consideration on that account. He practiced his profession with modesty and diligence, and because of his charity and benevolence was beloved by the people among whom he had cast his fortune. He was recognized from the start as a leading and public-spirited man, and was assigned to positions of trust and honor in the community. He was a devoted member of the Church of England, and he and his sons exerted themselves to establish the parish and church of St. James, so much so as to be called the founders thereof.\n\nHis two sons, Louis Henry and Moses John DeRosset, inherited his virtues, and each attained distinction in the Colony. The elder one, Louis Henry, in 1751 represented Wilmington in the Assembly at New Bern, was Justice of the Peace, appointed by the Council, was a member of the Council under Governor Johnston in 1752, and continued in that position until the Revolution; was Commissioner to issue bi"
