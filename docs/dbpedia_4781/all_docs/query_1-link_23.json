        "text": "§ The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for the COLONIES (Colonel SEELY)\n\nI am conscious that I am unworthy of the task which is imposed upon me, but following the precedent of a similar Bill, which was introduced into this House to unify or federate Canada, the task falls to me, and therefore I must claim the indulgence of the House while I explain to them as briefly as I can the provisions of this Bill. I will not go at any length into the growth and history of the feeling in favour of union. It is well set out in a very able Memorandum of Lord Selborne, and I cannot expect to add anything to the very clear and lucid statement of my Noble Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies, both in another place and in his speeches to the country. But this may be said, that this is no new desire on the part of the people of South Africa. All those who have lived in South Africa, whether they have left this country or not, have dreamed of union as the true solution of South African difficulties. As long ago as 1858, Sir George Grey, whose name will always be remembered with honour in South Africa and in England, proposed a scheme of union, and it was endorsed then, as this scheme is endorsed now, by the Orange Free State. Still it came to nothing. Further efforts were made by Lord Carnarvon, but they also did not succeed, and perhaps in both cases the reason was that, as Lord Selborne said, in neither case were the schemes entirely home-made. In this case the impetus comes from South Africa itself. At any rate, they did not succeed, and strife continued, and ultimately came the great South African war; but even then the ideal of union was not forgotten—union as only rendered possible by the union of the peoples who live in South Africa—union not of Governments, but of sentiment and aspiration. As soon as the war was over that ideal found expression. It found expression in South Africa in eloquent words from the lips of the Dutch, and it found expression from one whose absence from this Debate I am confident all of us, in whatever quarter of the House we sit, equally deplore—I mean the right hon. 952 Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham (Mr. J. Chamberlain). I cannot forbear to quote—and I will only quote twice in the remarks I have to make—I cannot forbear to quote at length the striking words he used shortly after the declaration of peace. On 29th July, 1902, speaking in this House, he said:— At least we may say that we start with a favouring gale: at least we may say, that those brave and able men, those gallant soldiers who laid down their arms and loyally accepted King Edward VII. as their Sovereign have been showing by everything that they have said since, how true they intend to he to their pledges and promises: and as they have retained, I am glad to say, their old influence with their followers, we may hope that they also recognise that under their new flag they may find prosperity and a condition of things which will in the end lie satisfactory to them. We have no intention, we have no desire, that these Boers, our former foes, should break with all their old traditions. We desire that they should preserve all the best characteristics of their race. We hope they will shake hands with us. that tiny will bury the animosity that has existed, and that they will co-operate with us in securing the prosperity of South Africa under a flag which, whatever may be said of us, has, at all events, protected differences of race, differences of religion, differences of language, and which will secure for all those who are under it, the peaceful enjoyment of their industry and the blessings of even-handed justice. These were eloquent words spoken by one with whom we often have not agreed, but they are peculiarly apposite to the circumstances under which we find ourselves to-day. The very men to whom the right hon. Gentleman referred have been foremost, as he prophesied they would be, in promoting that union of sentiment, that feeling of common nationality which has enabled this Bill to be introduced. With their distinguished colleagues they are in this country now—the leader of their forces in war, General Botha and others who signed the treaty of peace, and others on the English side, some who fought against them—and they have come bringing this Bill. They say, in fact, \"We are one people under one King, let us have one Parliament,\" and if, as we may hope and believe, this House accepts the Bill, for this is the last stage it must go through, this union will assuredly be completed, and following the gracious precedent set by himself, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has decided to go to South Africa and inaugurate the new régime by opening the Parliament for the first time. Who are the delegates? I must say a word about them. I will not name them all because their names are familiar to all, and they will, of course, be remembered here and in South Africa. But one I must name, Sir Henry de Villiers. It is not too much to say that without his unfailing tact, his wide know- 953 ledge of law and South African affairs and his unselfish devotion to a great cause, the difficult path of union might never have been successfully traversed. We here express our gratitude to him for all that he has done, and we only regret that on this, the final stage, he is not in this country, having been obliged to return to South Africa owing to the illness of Lady de Villiers. We gratefully acknowledge all that he has done for this great cause, and we hope heartily that his anxieties may be removed.\n\nThe Bill proposes then to set up one Parliament for the whole of South Africa. It proposes to amalgamate South Africa in a Union, closer than the Union of Australia, closer even than the Union of Canada, and, no doubt, this is wise from the nature of the case. There are particular reasons in South Africa why the closest form of Union should be the most desirable. The very fact of there being a vast native population, numbering between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 souls, who have to be governed to the greatest extent by the white races there, makes it essential that one single form of Government, with strength and with power and with sympathy, should pursue one common policy with regard to all native races. The Parliament is to be composed of the King, the Senate, and the House of Assembly. The Senate has 40 representatives, of whom eight are nominated by the Governor-General in Council and eight are elected by the members of each of the provincial councils, together with the representatives of the provinces in the Union Assembly. Of the eight senators who are to be nominated, four are to be chosen for their special knowledge of native affairs and the reasonable wishes of the natives, and I think this is a good provision, and one which may very likely be extended as time goes on. At any rate, in the Senate there is special representation in some form for the native races. The Senate, as a Second Chamber, has a right to reject or to amend all Bills except money Bills. Those it may not amend, but may reject, but arrangements are made following the precedent of the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, which, I think, are also derived from a similar precedent in Australia, by which the two Houses sit and vote together. In the case of money Bills they do that at 954 once. In the case of other Bills it is only after a measure has been passed a second time by the House of Assembly. But as the House of Assembly numbers 121 and the Senate only 40, it will appear that the power of the House of Assembly is somewhat greater than in the case of some Assemblies nearer home.\n\nThe members of the House of Assembly are selected, broadly speaking, in accordance with the European male adult population to be found in each province, so that, broadly speaking, there shall be a corresponding number of representatives in the Union Assembly to the number of those European male adults in the different provinces, Cape Colony, the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony and Natal. But in the course of the negotiations during the conventions which took place at Durban, at Capetown and at Bloemfontein, a concession was made to the smaller States, so that the Orange River Colony and Natal have rather more members than they would be entitled to, and Cape Colony and the Transvaal have somewhat fewer. The total members are divided as follows: for the Cape there are 21 representatives, for the Orange River Colony 17, for the Transvaal 36, and for Natal again 17. The qualifications of a member to sit in the Union Assembly have formed the subject of some criticism here. They are that he shall qualify to be a voter in the province in which he resides, that he shall be a British subject, that he shall have five yeans' residence, and that he shall be of European descent. The electoral divisions are to be based on the principle of one vote one value, so that approximately there shall be the same number of voters in each constituency. Here again a compromise has been arrived at by which there may be a margin of 15 per cent, one way or the other, in accordance with the physical features of the particular division, the density or sparsity of population, and so forth. Finally there is an arrangement for the automatic redistribution of seats, which seems to be a most excellent proposal, which we might well follow. I will not recount the functions of the Provincial Councils beyond saying that four are to be set up—four smaller Parliaments, as we might call them—for the Cape, the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, and Natal, but instead of their having fixed powers and the Union having all the rest, all such powers as the Provincial 955 Councils may have are specifically delegated to them, and all the rest belong to the Union Parliament. The importance of that provision cannot be over-estimated, for those of us, and I think nearly all of us are of one mind, who see the great advantage of a centralised form of Government in the peculiar circumstances of South Africa, will realise that this provision makes it certain that all matters of the highest importance affecting all the States, must always come to the central Parliament to decide.\n\nWith regard to the franchise, it is the same for the House of Assembly and for Provincial Councils, but it has not been found possible to have a uniform franchise for South Africa. The compromise arrived at is that the franchise shall be the same as it has been up to now. In all the different Colonies which now form the Union, to put it in a phrase, a man who had not got the vote before will not get one under this Bill, and no man who has a vote now will lose it under this Bill. [An Hon. Member: \"Are there no exceptional \"] My hon. Friend below the Gangway suggests that there may be exceptions. In any country and in any Parliament there may be exceptions. Any body of men can be disfranchised by Parliament, and of course in South Africa at the present time any body of men can be disfranchised by a bare majority. But there is an exception in the case of the coloured vote. In order to disfranchise those voters a majority of two-thirds is required. On this point again I will touch in a moment when I come to deal with the details of the Bill.\n\nWith regard to the powers and duties which are imposed on this Parliament, I would state that they take over the debts of the four Colonies. That in itself is a great advantage. They take over the management, of the whole railway system. One point on which all men have insisted is that it is necessary to the welfare of South Africa—all men from the early pioneers of the railways down to Lord Milner, when he started his Intercolonial Council—to avoid a war of railway rates. They take over the whole of the Civil Service, and I may say here that the existing rights of Civil servants are fully safeguarded under one of the later clauses of the Bill. A judiciary is set up for the whole of South Africa, including a Supreme Court. How great will be the advantage of having one common court of law, and how great will be the advantage of having a Supreme 956 Court to which they can all appeal, I think will be admitted.\n\nThere is one other matter to which I should refer, for it seemed to be the rock on which the Union was likely to split, namely, the question of the English and Dutch language. There were those who said it was impossible of solution, but a solution has been found entirely in accordance with the whole spirit of the Bill by putting the English and Dutch languages on an absolute equality in all respects. In all official documents, the courts of law, and the Houses of Parliament, the Dutch have been given equal rights and equal privileges. I cannot forbear from making my second quotation from a very striking and eloquent speech which Dr. Jameson delivered, and when we reflect who is the speaker and who is the man of whom he speaks, I think we shall realise how far South Africa has advanced on the road to union. Dr. Jameson, speaking on February 15th this year at Grahamstown, said:— And this one word is that everybody in South Africa owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Steyn, the late President of the Orange Free State, for the high-minded and disinterested attitude which he had taken up all through the Convention. It was a speech of his that cleared up to me the real meaning of the language question. We knew of their love for their mother tongue, but we did not realise the enormous meaning of this language question to a proud people like the Dutch, because it was not merely a love of their mother tongue, but that the fact of their language not getting, in their view, proper treatment was a symbol of inferiority between the races. That I understand. That I can share, and I went the whole hog and the whole length in the matter, and now we have absolute quality between the two languages. I believe what we have passed will be acceptable to the whole country, and that this will do away with the language question. It appears likely that Dr. Jameson's prophecy will be found true, and certainly all of us here who have followed the events of the past will endorse every word he said about Mr. Steyn. Mr. Steyn has been a noble and, indeed, a pathetic figure in the history of the Union. He fought his hardest to the end, and when the struggle was over he devoted his whole energies to the task of union. That is an example to us. Only one other word as to the powers and duties in the Bill. As to Clause 147 [administration of native affairs], my hon. friends both wished to extend that part of the Bill to matters specially affecting natives. The care and treatment of natives are given to this great central power. Again, in the Amendment introduced with the full concurrence of the delegates, for it merely carries out their well-known wishes, all matters specially or differentially affecting Asiatics are also given ex- 957 clusivesly to the Union Parliament to control. There is another provision—that special powers heretofore belonging to the Governors or Governors in Council shall now foe exercised by the Union Parliament—that is, by the Governor-General in Council. All matters affecting native reserves, native locations, all matters affecting native trusts, of which there are two instances in Natal, will be in the care of the central authority. This is what we said we hoped would occur when my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Percy Alden) moved his Resolution an this House a year ago. We hoped the central authority would have control over all these matters, and the House unanimously accepted a Resolution that some such solution as this would be for the good of all.\n\nNow I come to the schedule. I may say at once, in order to clear away misapprehension which still seems to exist, the schedule of the Bill is purely permissive. It does not bring transfer one hour nearer. In fact, in so far as it goes, I think it will be conclusively proved that it makes it somewhat more difficult. What it does is to lay down certain conditions. If and when the Central South African Government wishes to take over one or more Protectorates, as we anticipated in the Resolution that they would, and if and when His Majesty's Government agree, then we say that certain broad principles—and when I say we, I mean this Government and the South African delegates—which this House holds especially dear, shall be observed. The sale of liquor to natives shall be prohibited. Their lands shall be guaranteed to them. They shall not be taken away. Finally, a form of government is proposed to be set up which will prevent that sudden break from one form of government to another, which all of us here who try to understand this difficult matter know would be so disastrous to native interests. If the Bill passes, as His Majesty's Government hope and trust it may, and it comes into full operation, in the long distant years it well may be when these Protectorates are transferred, instead of having a sudden transfer from the control from the High Commissioner's office, as we have at the present, with a staff that has a special knowledge of native wants and reasonable native wishes, in fact a transfer to a Government direct from a Parliament without any antecedent machinery, you will have the transition so gradual that I hope and believe that the natives will never know from anything that 958 occurs to them that the transition has been effected. It may be that the very same men will administer exactly the same kind of law in exactly the same kind of way. If that should come about it would be a fortunate solution. It would be carrying out the wishes of this House, expressed in the Resolution which I may be permitted to quote: \"The House trusts that His Majesty's Government will welcome the adoption of the provisions calculated to render possible the ultimate inclusion of the whole of British South Africa.\" [An HON. MEMBER: \"In a Federal Union.\"] It does not make any difference to the Protectorates whether the Union is federal or unified, except that on all hands it is agreed that the unified form is preferable. It will make that transition, when it comes, as little sudden as it possibly can be, and it may well be hardly perceivable to the natives themselves as far as their own status and rights are concerned.\n\nI have concluded the general outline of the Bill. I have only touched on a few of its more salient features. I know that the House is familiar with most of its provisions, as it has been in the hands of Members for eight or ten days. Let us come for a moment to the criticisms which have been levelled against the Bill. Everyone, in whatever part of the House he sits, I am sure will see that this is a great and statesmanlike measure. They admire the sentiments of those who have inspired it. They know that those who want this Bill mean to do right and justice to all men and all races and creeds in South Africa. Naturally it is not perfect, and criticisms have been levelled against certain points. There are about three points on which criticisms have been directed. The first is with regard to the provisions that in order to be a Member of the Senate or of the House of Assembly it is necessary to be a British subject of European descent. With regard to this disability imposed upon election to the Union Parliament, I may at once, speaking for the Government, say that we regret that those words are in the Bill, but we know that they form part of an essential compromise, and for this reason, that when the House granted self-government to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, it granted them a franchise which excluded the natives from the vote and still more from the Parliament. On the other hand, the Cape has for many a long year, for 55 years if I remember aright, had a franchise of a restricted nature, which some, though not a 959 great proportion, of the natives can enjoy. Therefore, you have these two divergent systems, to both of which we in this House had formerly assented. One says: \"We will endeavour to treat the native as an equal in all respects, provided he comes up to a certain, not so much intellectual as monetary standard.\" That is a system which we have endeavoured to follow ourselves. The other system says: \"The native must be treated with every consideration, but you will treat him as you would treat a minor in this country. You will not let him have all the privileges of an adult. Hs will grow up in time. For the present you cannot give him equal rights. You are imposing disabilities upon him now, and you must treat him as a minor with regard to political rights.\" To that also we have assented. There were at that time a few who did not assent. My right hon. Friend the Member for the Forest of Dean (Sir Charles Dilke) pointed out that this was falling away from the principle which we had long adopted; but the House as a whole assented, and assented to it unanimously, or at any rate without dissent. That being the state of affairs, we have established these two systems ourselves in South Africa. How is a compromise to be effected?\n\n4 0 P.M.\n\nThe compromise effected is this, that while every native in Cape Colony retains his right to vote, the chance of being deprived of his vote is specifically made more remote than in the case of other classes of persons. On the other hand, the native is debarred from sitting in the Union Parliament because he was debarred from sitting in two of the Parliaments by our own action here. On that a compromise is arrived at, and I can only assure the House, speaking with all seriousness, that we know that if these words were struck out the Union would be smashed, with results most evil for the natives whom we wish to protect. I am told on all hands by those who have best reason to know that if we here were to break up and smash this great Act of Union for the sake of these words the result on the native races of South Africa in breaking down the rapidly growing sympathy between the two races must be disastrous in the extreme. In reference to the criticisms on this question, may I point out that the Government of this country have assented to similar words in a very recent Act; and that in our own official documents here they have not only words as stringent but words more stringent limiting the highest 960 posts in this country to persons of a particular sect. And I ask the House in all seriousness, can we now break up this great measure of conciliation, causing possibly infinite damage to the people whom we set up to protect, for the sake of a principle to which we ourselves have not been faithful? I believe we can do no such thing. I do not think it would be fair. I turn to the other question, to the Cape franchise, which is not a matter so much of striking out or leaving in words as a matter of degree. There are those who say that a two-thirds majority is not sufficiently large. I pass by, of course, the suggestion that a two-thirds majority being taken to be necessary to disfranchise the coloured vote is an invitation to secure that majority, because, of course, as everyone in South Africa knows that a two-thirds majority obviously must be to some extent a safeguard. It cannot be anything else. The question is, Is it enough? First let us ask if it is likely that the attempt will be made to disfranchise the Cape natives, and next, if it is likely to succeed if made? It would seem to me to be the last body to take that course. The South African Parliament will, as I have shown, have matters of vast importance to deal with; they have a great machinery to set up and set going, and are they likely to take a course which must involve such infinite trouble while they are busy with other things, and, above all, are they likely to do it when the system is working so admirably and so well? It seems to me really unlikely, if we are to judge by history. I have endeavoured to find a single instance where s great body of persons like this, a whole race, has been disfranchised in democratic times. If there is such an instance, I cannot find it. Is it likely then that it will be attempted? To leave the realms of speculation, if it were attempted, would it succeed? That such a thing will happen I cannot believe. In order that it should succeed, at least two-thirds of both Houses sitting together would have to vote for it. The total of the two Houses is 161, and two-thirds of that is 108; therefore, unless my arithmetic is wrong, if 54 persons can be found to vote for the colour franchise, it must remain. In that assembly of the two Houses the Cape will be represented by 59 persons, 51 of their own members and eight of the Senate. Are they likely to risk the storm that would be created by interfering with a system which has worked so well? But to these, again, have to be added the four senators specially 961 elected, or rather, nominated, to look after native interests and their reasonable wants and wishes. Can anyone say that the vote for the natives of Cape Colony is not a reasonable wish?\n\n§ Mr. LYTTELTON\n\nNothing in the statement which we have just heard—a statement clear, eloquent, and persuasive—has in the least deflected the intention which I expressed two or three weeks ago, when I ventured to express upon behalf both of my Friend as well as myself that this Bill should be received by us with welcome and with sympathy. I do not think that anybody can doubt that it is a great achievement for South Africa to have formulated and constructed this measure of Union. A great measure, a measure most remarkable as coming from a country whose population consists, I think, of only a million whites, or less than a fifth of the population of London, this is a measure which has been initiated by the energy and the enthusiasm of young Africa, and which has been matured and constructed by the statesmen of South Africa powerfully impelled by that initial energy. His Majesty's Government have, I think, made not one material change in the Bill, and we therefore have a right to presume that this Bill as it stands now is the will of South Africa. Scarcely one stone has been changed in the fabric designed by her architects and fashioned by her craftsmen. It is useless, however, to disguise that one portion of this Bill has aroused acute controversy, and it would not be respectful for me to ignore for a moment that native aspirations have been in some sense slighted according to their view, and it would not be respectful for me not to notice those aspirations, especially as they have been pleaded here by very able men, very high-minded men, men who have been led in this matter by one of great ability and lofty character—Mr. Schreiner. I think we have to remember the Government assures us the will of South Africa is that this shall be the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill.\n\nLet me, before I examine the three points which have been touched on by the hon. Gentleman (Colonel Seely) with regard to this native controversy, remind the House of three or four considerations of a general character which seem to me to have great weight in this connection. I suppose the extreme expression of both sides with regard to the Government and franchise of natives is to be found in the American Constitution and in the old Transvaal Constitution. In the Grondwet of the 967 Transvaal there was a clause which provides that there should be no equality in Church or in State between the black and the white man. That is the extreme on one side. The American Constitution gives absolute equality of civic rights. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear.\"] I cannot join in that cheer. I think it is best to be perfectly candid and sincere in this matter and to face the facts, and my own firm conviction is that the citizens of the United States, when they gave absolute equality and civic rights to the black races and negroes within their boundaries, that they were misled by rhetoricians, that they were deceived by the false simplicity of words, that they did not look at the real hard rigour of the facts. What has been the result since? The result has not been that the negroes have been treated as equals, far from it. Socially, of course, I am certain that they have been treated on a lower scale by their supposed political equality than if they had been treated in a way that is more fitting their standing in civilisation. And upon the American people themselves, if I may venture to say so with respect, it has been disastrous; the efforts which they have made by duress, and sometimes by even worse efforts, they have made and successfully made to make this franchise so improvidently granted a thing of no real account. The effect upon the American nation as a whole I am perfectly certain, so far as this is concerned, has been that which no other nation can desire. I therefore, though I do not sympathise and do not agree with the old Grondwet of the Transvaal—far from it—I think of the two it is better to face the real facts and to acknowledge that the black races are not the equals of the white than to give them a franchise which probably, in my opinion at any rate, would lead to little if any good to them, and would, I am certain, lead to some demoralisation among the whites. My second general consideration, and I ask the House and those who have advocated the native franchise here to remember this, is that this is not merely a South African Bill, fashioned, as I have said, by South Africans, but it is a Bill which is fashioned by four states to whom responsible government has been granted. There have been differences of opinion as to the exact moment of time in which from time to time responsible government has been granted, but I am perfectly certain that once responsible government is granted 968 that it is far better, and you may hold this view even if you have been reluctant to grant it, as soon as it has been granted, and once it has been granted, it is far better to give full and perfect and unfettered trust to the persons to whom you have given that responsibility. It would take away the grace and seemliness of this grant of responsible government if any other view were taken; nor do I believe that it is possible with any degree of sound policy to act in any other way than that which I have ventured to outline. If you interfere substantially as between the black races and the future Union Government of South Africa, consider the effect upon the situation. At present not merely have those who in that country propose measures which may affect the black races the responsibility, but upon them the consequences of their action will immediately fall. If one false step is taken, not merely upon our fellow subjects in South Africa, but upon all those who are near and dear to them, will fall the full consequences of their blunder—the frightful loss of life, the utter dislocation of industry, and the ruinous destruction of the fabric of civilisation which has so recently and so painfully been rebuilt. I think it best on general principles that we should leave that responsibility, and that we may leave it without much fear if we consider the consequences of the misuse of the powers which are now entrusted to the United Parliament.\n\nI ought to say, lastly, in regard to the controversy which has arisen upon the native question, that His Majesty's Government, who have had access to all the facts, and have had information which it is impossible for the Members of the Opposition or for myself to have had, have expressed themselves confident that the powers they have given are such, and such only, as would be accepted. These general considerations, wholly apart from the cry of the wreck of the Union—a cry which I think has been rather too freely used—make me approach the criticisms which have been made upon the native portion of the Bill with the greatest possible caution, but, I must say, a bias, which I freely avow to the House, towards conceding that which is now unanimously demanded.\n\nLet me examine for a few moments the three questions in detail. It is said that the Cape Colony native may have his vote taken away by a two-thirds majority in the United Parliament. But so far as that 969 is at all practicable—and I think I shall show in a moment that it is not—at ought to be set off against this, which has not been mentioned by the Under-Secretary, namely, that the Cape Colony natives, though they lose something, gain something under the new constitution; for their vote will have a wider and more general influence than it has had under the old. Formerly the natives were voters merely in the Cape Colony. Now their voice will extend further and in a more penetrating way; they will become voters in a Parliament of greater power and importance. It must be remembered that in the Commonwealth or United Parliament, the natives themselves will be represented by men who have been lifelong champions of their cause. I need not mention names; they are so many; but they must be familiar to all who are acquainted with this subject. There will go forth from Cape Colony into the United Parliament men whose life has been devoted to asserting the claims of the Natives, protecting them, and seeing that their rights are maintained in due course. Under these circumstances it seems to me unless the relation of the races one to another becomes utterly changed—and I do not think we need anticipate that—almost unthinkable that the franchise in the Cape will be taken away from the natives unless some substitute of a more advantageous character and more acceptable to them is given in its place. Therefore, so far as concerns the first point, which I know is regarded by Mr. Schreiner as of great importance, I think the decision of the Government is to be defended.\n\nI regret equally with the hon. Gentleman the provision with regard to European descent. I do not wish to be misunderstood upon that. There is great force in the observation of the Under-Secretary, that in this country minors to this day are treated as not qualified for the franchise. It is not 60 years ago that many workmen in this country were without a vote, and it is only a short time since Jews were without qualification for a seat in Parliament in this country. It is a strong proposition for those who assert, I think, perfectly truly that the natives are as children, to say that they are to be placed in a position in which many of them could occupy a seat in Parliament. My own impression is that it is unwise to put in that provision, because as we all know, there are at any rate a fair number of the native population of South Africa who are very highly educated, and I regret that 970 the South African Parliaments have not seen their way to insert a provision which would meet those exceptional cases But here again, I am impressed by what the Government have said, that they are satisfied on this point that an alteration would break up the compromise which has been arrived at. This, however, is a matter of consolation; it is always to be remembered that this step may be retraced. If opinion in South Africa becomes more favourably disposed towards native claims as I believe is becoming the case now—there is nothing to prevent the United Government in the future retracing that step, and saying—as I think they would be more ready to do from the fact that we do not interfere here—that that bar should in future be removed.\n\nIn regard to the Protectorates, I am in very cordial agreement with the Under-Secretary in reference to the Schedule, which I think is a very wise and politic document. I entirely agree with the opinion which Lord Selborne has expressed in public, that what the native looks to is personality and continuity. He dislikes Parliamentary government. He does not understand it. What he looks to are personalities. He looks far more to the King than he does to this Parliament; and if the protectors which are set up in South Africa are allowed to do their work, as I trust they will be, I am perfectly certain that they will be a far greater and more satisfactory protection to the native races—at all events in their eyes—than any Parliament you can imagine. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is a matter of congratulation that the natives are unwilling to sever their connection with the Imperial Government of this country. That is not a criticism of the new Government in South Africa; but it is a just tribute to the Government of the King. I feel particularly strongly that this feeling ought to be respected, because the Basutos and the Swazis both submitted voluntarily not to the arms of South Africa, but to the protection of Her Majesty the Queen. As long as the natives are emphatically of that mind, even if a third party of the most admirable character wished to take the place of the original guardian, I should feel inclined to consult in the first instance the desires and wishes of the wards. It has been justly said, in reference to the Schedule which lays down the conditions—as I think the very wise and just conditions—which are imposed when a transfer is made, that, so far as the 971 actual transfer of the dominion of these Protectorates from His Majesty the King to the South African Parliament is concerned, nothing in this Bill hastens or facilitates it. Therefore, in the event of its being arranged in future, as it well may be, and I anticipate will be, with the consent of the natives, that they should be transferred to the South African Parliament, their rights will be protected and safeguarded in a manner which I am perfectly certain is wise and in conformity with the best traditions of those who understand native customs and native races. These great powers which are being taken over, and the relations which the South African Parliament as a whole will assume towards the native races, will both sober and inspire South African opinion; and we may well leave that part of the subject with the prayer which I think was used in the old Commonwealth Parliament, that those who have zeal may have wisdom, and that those who have wisdom may have zeal.\n\nThere are some other points which I can deal with much more briefly, because they have been most lucidly explained by the Under-Secretary, and because they give me, and I think my friends, almost unmixed satisfaction. The idea of Union, of course, is not new. Sir George Grey, Lord Carnarvon, Mr. Froude, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham (Mr. J. Chamberlain), Lord Milner and Lord Selborne have all been powerful advocates of Union; but, as we know, there have been interruptions to that aspiration. I do not wish to go into the matter, but those who have studied the subject will know that the Unionist policy, the policy of Lord Carnarvon, was annexation; and Sir Bartle Frere with great pertinacity always advocated, as did Lord Carnarvon, that annexation should be followed by the grant of self-government and Union, or Confederation. That was their policy. The unfortunate thing was, as hon. Members who will remember the General Election of 1880 well know, that annexation was denounced by the Liberal Opposition in those days, though when the Liberal party came into power the annexation was not reversed, neither was self-government or confederation granted. And then ensued as the result the war which terminated at Majuba Hill, and 17 years which have been described by a Liberal historian—a late colleague of right hon. Gentlemen opposite, Mr. James Bryce—as having brought great resent- 972 ment among the English races and great contempt amongst the Dutch races. Those mischievous humours have been removed, and if the \"sharp surgery of the war,\" as it has been called, is disliked by some, at any rate all must admit, I think, that no war was ever fought with a more generous spirit on both sides. [Several HON. MEMBERS: \"No, no.\"] The result of it is that as between the two races there has been a generous feeling arrived at very soon after the termination of the war, which I think myself—it is only my opinion —has led more rapidly to the union of the races at the present time than had that war never been fought. [An HON. MEMBER: \"No, no.\"] I feel compelled to say it, and I am sure that almost everybody in South Africa would admit it that the great work of reconstruction which took place under Lord Milner since the war has been another very great cause and agent in the formation of the Union. As the House is aware, the late Government did not feel themselves justified at that time in going so far as to grant responsible government; that is to say, in the year 1905. But what is called the half-way house stage—representative government was granted to them according to the solemn terms of the Peace of Vereeniging, which promised that form of government and led up to self-government. It was intended, if I may use the words that I myself wrote on the subject:— As a school for self-government, as a means of bringing citizens together in political co-operation; a sphere for the natural selection of men most fitted to lead and ultimately to undertake the responsibilities of administration. Lord Milner, almost at the same moment, I think, expressed words to the effect that his desire was:— To effect what could be effected by the granting of representative government—that the representation of the people must be numerous enough not only to voice popular opinion but to determine the character of the laws, and except where vital Imperial interests were concerned practically to direct the policy of the Administration. That was the policy of the late Government. We did not think that in 1905 the moment was ripe for responsible government. Had responsible government not been granted when it was, undoubtedly some bitterness, some evils would have been avoided. But I am perfectly ready, and always have been, to coufess that His Majesty's Government, in granting that responsible government, did obtain the speedier and more spontaneous good will of the Dutch races than anybody, I think, could have anticipated. I think it is only fair and just to say and to make that 973 frank admission. Be that as it may, do not let us at this moment of happy augury exaggerate any differences that exist between us. There is no real, essential difference between the policy of the late Government with regard to that and the policy of the present Government.\n\nBoth were in favour of responsible government. The only difference was—I am not denying a somewhat important, but not an essential difference—the only difference was as to the exact time at which it should be granted. However, both policies depended, and rested upon, one great fact in South Africa—it has been alluded to by the hon. Gentleman—I mean equal rights and automatic redistribution. These are the two great points which we contended for in 1905, and which the Transvaal delegates have firmly and inflexibly adhered to since the beginning of the negotiations for the united government. I confess to a feeling of great admiration for the tenacity with which they held to these two great points. No doubt they were difficult to put through. I also pay my tribute to General Botha for the loyal support he gave to the British representatives in their demand for those equal rights. They have enabled anyone who believes in the race to look with cheerfulness to the future. Our people, at any rate, are placable and exceptionally good-natured; our people are also essentially self-confident. I believe ever since it has been seen that their wish, seconded by our Dutch fellow-subjects in the Transvaal, was that equality of representation, in the true sense of the word, should be granted, that every Briton in South Africa has felt, \"It will be my fault if I do not push my way in the future as in the past.\" I am quite sure that there is now no feeling of resentment against the Dutch, but rather a feeling of generous emulation. Let us most fervently trust that that emulation may continue, and be productive of great fruits in a happy and united South Africa.\n\n§ Sir C. W. DILKE\n\nWe had a good deal of reason for thinking we could get more. At all events, I am convinced that this particular provision of ineligibility, which renders the future of the native races, the coloured people, highly-educated coloured 975 people, a small minority, hopeless, which forces the best of the coloured people into the ranks of the native races instead of raising them up to the level of the white people—I cannot but think that that is unnecessary. The earlier recommendation might have avoided that terrible bar—slur. Mr. Rhodes's civilised coloured man should be let in. It must be remembered—we heard from the Front Bench—that this is the will of amalgamated South Africa. But the four Colonies which promoted the Bill are only one-third of South Africa. Two-thirds are outside. It is a union of the four Colonies. A very large native population is outside. There are two clauses making the four Colonics masters, to a certain extent, of two-thirds of South Africa outside those four Colonies. One is Clause 150, for the possible transference of the Chartered territories, and the other is Clause 151, for the possible transference of the three great Protectorates. We have heard for the first time the pledge of the Government, so far as they can pledge their successors, that this House will be consulted as to those three great Protectorates; but we have not heard a word about the possible transference of the Chartered territories, which are vast in area, and which at the present moment are ruled, as are the Protectorates, Cape Colony, and, theoretically, Natal, by the old British principle as against the Boer principle—the principle of equality of rights. We were told that one of the main objects of the war, and one of the dominating factors in any peace that could be made, would be the assertion of the Cape principle as against the Boer principle. In the two Colonies we gave up the Cape principle for the Boer principle. The Treaty was observed not only in the letter, but in the spirit. We have allowed the Boer principle to extend and predominate throughout South Africa. Here are the four Colonies that came together—representing one third of British South Africa and of those four Colonies one—the Cape—is not a very long participant in the principle which we so deeply regret. Sir Henry de Villiers, the Chairman of the Convention, was quoted against the right of this House to touch such a matter. He was the only great Colonial statesman who supported the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham in making an important change in the Australian Act, which was 976 made against the will and against the fierce opposition of Mr. Deakin and Mr. Barton, the representatives of Australia. Sir Henry de Villiers whose authority was so great, expressed his regret at this colour bar as strongly as it has been expressed to-day by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. The Cape has yielded, and the Cape has, to some extent, been forced into that yielding. There has been in the speeches today a certain confusion of the very different communities that make up South Africa. The then Secretary of State for the Colonies saw reason after the war to apologise, as many of us have had to apologise, to the Boers for having suggested that their treatment of the natives was brutal and unworthy of a civilised nation. We know, as we ought to have known before, that they are personally very kind, if not kinder, than the English, in their treatment of the natives. But they take a different view. They have got a different ideal to the British ideal. Some of us who opposed the war would have been much more inclined in favour of the war if we had believed in the possibility of carrying through our ideal against that of those brave and stubborn Dutch people. We know that great declaration of Lord Milner adopting the Rhodes policy. We know the declaration of the Member for West Birmingham adopting the same policy, and refusing to purchase peace by leaving the coloured people in the position in which they stood before the war. I confess I speak on this matter with the utmost moderation, and with the utmost respect for South African opinion, but I cannot in honour say we are not worsening the position of the natives in the future. The Under-Secretary referred to the previous attempt by this House at making a Federal Union in South Africa. At that time Mr. W. E. Forster forced into the Bill against the Government the 19th section of the British South Africa Act, which provides for representation by election of the natives in any Union Parliament. Those were the terms of the clause forced into that Bill by the House of Commons, and the very reason which led Mr. Forster to take up the matter at that time is likely to occur in South Africa. The Cape ideal has been, by the admission of the Government, carried out. The same ideal, theoretically, exists in Natal. It still, for example, exists as regards ineligibility. The Cape, where the British ideal exists, and is prevented by the Act, has a vastly larger area and a far larger 977 white population than the three other Colonies. It has the same native population. There are 2¼ millions in the Cape and 2¼ millions in the three Colonies, but in the Cape you have what you have less in the other Colonies, you have a most interesting coloured population producing men of the highest possible attainments. The Cape natives have risen steadily under our Cape ideal, whereas the natives in Natal have not risen under the decline from the ideal there. Labour was entirely unrepresented at the Convention. Labour interests were never mentioned. I do not wish to be an alarmist, but I do not think it can be said that we are strengthening the Imperial fabric, in an Empire where there are 360 millions of coloured people under our rule, by this non-Federal Union in South Africa under such conditions. My hon. Friend mentioned in his speech the position occupied by the ideal King in South Africa. In large portions of South Africa we have encouraged the idea that there was a great paramount chief, especially among the tribal natives, who are not promising as electors. I agree that the part of the King in their affairs has great weight, and we must be careful about shaking that view. The Boer statesmen of South Africa have modified their extreme views as regards the great reservations. I agree that, as regards those reservations, that outside the Protectorates, probably, the Bill slightly improves the existing state of things. That, I think, is possible. In Natal the paramount chief, who was the King and afterwards was the governor, ultimately became the temporary Prime Minister of a Parliament not always sympathetic towards native views; and that warns us of what we should avoid as regards the path we should tread. I hope this Bill may do something to secure better conditions in cases of that kind. On the other hand, we must remember that there may be temptations on the part of Parliament at any moment to adopt a different policy. There may be scares leading to an attempt at disarmament, which are most dangerous in and near Basuto-land. I notice that our troops are still to be left in South Africa in large numbers. I may point out that all the grants of full self-government and full responsible institutions have been followed by the withdrawal of the troops and by the placing of reliance upon the people themselves. In South Africa my hon. Friend has defended the retention of the garrison and 978 the Secretary of State for War only a week or two ago used the phrase:— These troops are regarded as of great value by the statesmen of South Africa. They have allowed the disbanding of the special police which were raised in several of the States, and the Cape Mounted Police, a most admirable force, have been economically got rid of on account of the reliance on British troops. We are bound to Bechuanaland, Swaziland, and Basutoland by peculiar ties, and we cannot regard ourselves as being free from responsibility for their future, although it is quite clear that the circumstances are exceptional in a degree which makes it the duty of this House to scrutinise very closely in Committee the provisions of this Bill. Bechuanaland was saved by this House on the ground of the protection of the natives. Swaziland was saved by the British Government of the right hon. Gentleman in 1898, and Bechuanaland, and Basutoland have never been conquered, and the Basutos came under the Crown when the Cape had failed to manage them. We have learned a great deal of wisdom since. With regard to charter land, there was a statement in \"The Times\" on 8th July by Sir Lewis Michell containing the conditions on which charter land alone could be surrendered to the Union Parliament should it be desired to do so as the result of negotiations which were then beginning. There is probably no immediate fear of that arrangement, but the second condition, which is the only one affecting labour, was not of a kind satisfactory to those who have the interests of labour at heart. The condition was for cheap labour, and the Chartered Company require a guarantee for the supply of native labour from the Union Parliament I do not think that is a satisfactory condition to put forward, and we should have some assurance with regard to the Chartered territory in the nature of that which has been given with regard to the Protectorates. But if we feel fairly easy about the Protectorates and the Chartered territory, which includes the two-thirds of British South Africa outside this particular one-third now coming into the Union, we have to look plainly in the Bill to the question of the gratuitous assertion of the colour bar. I am not disposed to argue this question on the second reading any more than the details of the treatment of the Protectorates, which can very well be left to the Committee. Views may have changed upon the question of eligibility, out that does not matter, because the 979 statement which has been made on this point will not bear investigation for one moment. It is the temporary closing of the door, and it is a slap in the face for men who are well educated and quite as competent to be Members of Parliament as we are ourselves. There seems to be a certain avoidance in this Debate of the real meaning of this ineligibility. I will mention the case of Dr. Adburahman, who was a supporter of the war, and who was one of those who supported vehemently Mr. Rhodes's view, and who, like many others who are doubtful about this ineligibility, supports the Cape ideal, although he does not want to go into Parliament himself, and never did. In the Transvaal they have been, I know, rather easygoing in this matter, but by this Bill you are taking a man like Dr. Adburahman, who was three times elected chairman of the most important municipal committee of Cape Town, and saying to him, \"You shall never be a member of Parliament.\" Are you going to pass an Act of Parliament containing these ill-chosen words under which you do not know whether you are going to exclude such men as Dr. Adburahman? The case which decided this point was that of the Queen v. Willet, and that was decided by three judges in the Transvaal Court, I think, in the year 1906. There was an article in \"The Times\" explaining the circumstances, and these words were used:— European descent not likely to be we construed as to bar the son of a mixed marriage. In the Swarts case, quoted by the Under-Secretary, the judges said that the claimants were unable to prove that their ancestors were absolutely of European descent. That is not very encouraging. But although it is not encouraging, I do suggest that we ought to know whether we are really passing a law which will have the effect of disfranchising a man like Colonel Warburton. Are you going to disfranchise men like that? I do not think we ought to pass words so vague. I think it is unnecessary to refer to all those who have expressed the most extreme regret at the insertion of this colour bar. It could not have been expressed more strongly than it was expressed to-day by both Front Benches. It has also been expressed by men like Sir Henry de Villiers, who said:— The colour bar is most objectionable. Sir Henry de Villiers also said:— I admit that their status is lowered. 980 That, I think, is the correct view. I will not trouble the House with anything further from these decided cases. I will only once more suggest that this is an entirely new departure. The speech of the Under-Secretary shows that the Union Parliament is not only a Union Parliament but a new body which we are calling into being. The Bill abolishes the existing Cape Parliament and merely allows the provinces to be recreated, subject to a possible union or division by the Union Parliament. They can alter boundaries and divide provinces. Is there any suggestion on the part of anyone that Lord Crewe did not go somewhat too far when he declared that we must deal with South Africa and regard it now as a permanent white settlement? If this exclusion is to be insisted upon, we shall be setting up a permanent white oligarchy in a permanent minority among a vastly larger number of persons who supply virtually all the labour of the country. General Smuts is the only Boer leader who has used language pointing to any suggestion that South Africa can ever be a white man's country in the ordinary use of that phrase. Three months ago he said:— South Africa is to be a white man's country, whatever ill-informed people in England might say to the contrary. Those of us who hold strong views on this subject have tried to be moderate and to meet the views, hitherto rejected by this country, which have been put before us lately in place of our own ideal; but, while we have done our best to meet the arrangement with regard to the franchise, some of us do resent the gratuitous throwing into this Bill of the principle of ineligibility employed in language so vague. Sir Joseph Ward, Prime Minister of New Zealand, the moment he saw the terms of the Union, telegraphed to South Africa imploring them not gratuitously to make this distinction. He pointed out the admirable results obtained in New Zealand by the insertion in their constitution of representation of the Maories in both Houses of Parliament, but in this Bill we have a mere mockery of representation by four senators who must be compulsorily of white blood. Supposing Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Swaziland, and the Chartered Territories are to be brought in, and this House is to be consulted, as we have been promised, are we again to stretch a point and to convert a temporary engagement into a permanent one? Are we to stretch it over South Africa? It is clear there must be an insistence upon our view as regards 981 the principle, but we may try to come nearer to our Boer friends and make them see our ideal, as lately we have tried to see their admirable projects, and as many of us have recognised them. We have undoubtedly a great trust on behalf of the native population in South Africa, but that trust is much more plainly obvious to all men in regard to the countries outside the four Colonies than it is in regard to the countries within those Colonies which are subject to the ordinary principles of local self-government. No one can deny our absolute trusteeship and complete responsibility in regard to the countries outside the four Colonies, and in order that we may not be drawn into sacrificing immortal principles over the whole of South Africa, I think it is necessary, as quickly as possible, to make some resistance to this ineligibility and this insertion of a colour bar.\n\n§ Mr. KEIR HARDIE\n\nNo one can speak in this Debate without feeling a sense of very great responsibility, because when this Bill has passed through this House, unlike others, it will be beyond recall or possibility of either repeal or amendment, and coming, as it does, with the full authority of the four Parliaments now existing in South Africa, it would be rashness carried to an extreme for the House of Commons, or any Member of the House of Commons, to seek to interfere with the 988 matters affecting those representatives of the four Parliaments in South Africa. I want to preface my remarks by saying that any criticism which we on these benches have to offer to the Bill, or any proposals or suggestions we have to make, as Amendments, do not affect the white population of South Africa, but only those whom we are bound, as has been freely admitted both in another place and here, to regard as our wards, the coloured or native population, for whom we are more or less directly responsible. It was all to the credit of the Under-Secretary for Colonial Affairs (Colonel Seely) that he was laboured in his apology for certain portions of the Bill. It shows, as he frankly admitted, that those particular clauses were not there by his will, or even in accordance with his own feelings. A similar remark applies to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover-sqaure (Mr. Lyttelton). No speech made yet has endeavoured to justify the appearance of certain clauses in this Bill. We have had those clauses apologised for; we have had attempts made to explain the reasons for their being there, but so far as the discussion has gone not one single speaker has sought to justify the presence of certain clauses, which I will deal with in a moment. The whole scheme of the Bill—and this will not, I think, be denied in any quarter—the whole scheme of the Bill is that of a white European South Africa, and that, under the circumstances, seems to some of us to be an impossibility. The method by which, for example, those who are to elect the representatives from the different provinces is to be ascertained is, after all, to consist of adult male Europeans.\n\nFor the purpose of the operation of this Act, there are two classes of people in South Africa who do not exist. First of all, the women of all races. They are ruled out, as are also the natives, who are in a proportion of six to one. The Kaffir man and the white woman of European descent are classed together in The Bill as not being fit to be counted, even in ascertaining what proportion of representation is to go to each of the provinces. May I say that none of us here are pressing that natives should get the franchise; neither are we seeking to enforce native representation or to remove the disqualification concerning natives in the Transvaal and Orange Free State. So far as we are concerned on these benches, what we seek to obtain—and in Committee stage we shall do our best to obtain—is that the status 989 quo shall be continued, both in Cape Colony and Natal. At the present time in Cape Colony, out of 181,000 voters, 22,000 of these are coloured and native. There is no special native franchise in Cape Colony, but the law has been fr6m the beginning that any person, no matter of what race, who is able to show the necessary qualifications shall ipso facto be admitted to the franchise, and the result has been that, out of a total electorate of 181,000, no fewer than 22,000 of those have been coloured or natives, who have raised themselves to the position of the necessary qualification. It may be said, it has been said, that this Bill does not interfere with the franchise in the Cape Colony. It has been said by the Under-Secretary that the framers of the Bill have taken special words to safeguard the continuance of the existing franchise in the Cape Colony. That may be so I confess, in regard to the franchise itself, but what about the disqualification of natives from being elected by the Cape Colony to a seat in the Union Parliament. What is the footing which the native or coloured people are put upon in Cape Colony itself, and what does it foreshadow? The right hon. Gentleman the Member for St. George's, Hanover-square (Mr. Lyttelton) said that in future the status would be enlarged, because they would have to elect a member not of the Provincial Parliament but of the South African Parliament, and therein rests an additional reason for attempting to get rid of this Cape Colony voting, for if the coloured man is so very objectionable that those who are to form this Parliament will not even run the risk of one of them being elected to sit by their side—if so, surely they will be unwilling to have the influence of the coloured men brought to bear upon them through their voting power in Cape Colony.\n\nBesides that, the fact is that the existence of the franchise in the Cape Colony will be regarded as a reflection upon those other portions of the Union where no similar right and privilege has been secured, and for all these reasons there will be a strong inducement on the part of the statesmen and legislators outside the Cape Colony itself to endeavour to have the franchise equalised all over South Africa, not by bringing in the natives or coloured persons in the Transvaal or Orange Free State, but by excluding the native or coloured person where he now possesses the franchise, and this danger is not so very remote as may appear. As a matter of fact, we have several recent de- 990 clarations on the subject from those who, in the future, will exert the determining influence in South Africa, which show that the apprehensions in the main of the natives are not without substantial foundation. On 24th February this year, for example, General Botha, speaking on this very subject, said:— The difficulty which we encountered was the native franchise. There is not a matter on which I have a stronger feeling than this of the native franchise, but do not let as blame our brothers of the Cape Colony. The native franchise was given to them at the time when they received responsible government. We know that it would be impossible for the Imperial Government to take back that which they have once given in the Cape Colony. We had a two-fold difficulty. How can you expect the Cape Parliament to pass this draft Constitution if it were to take away the native franchise? The only possible course for us to follow was followed in the draft Constitution and that was to create machinery which would enable the people of South Africa to settle this question. The interpretation of that is that General Botha generously exonerated the white people of the Cape from all blame for having given the franchise to the natives, since that franchise was forced upon them by the Imperial Parliament at the time the Constitution was given. A phrase of that kind gives a fair indication as to the mind of General Botha on this subject. Speaking on the same day—and this dots the \"i's\" and crosses the \"t's\" of General Botha's statement—General Smuts says:— There was a vast majority of people in South Africa opposed to the native franchise. The Transvaal was very largely opposed to it and so were the Free States and Natal, and for that matter he supposed a large part of the Cape. As Mr. Merriman had said in his speech, the majority of the people of the Cape were opposed to it and on the first occasion that Parliament met it would be swept away. It was found necessary that there should be some check on such arbitrary action but it was not a powerful check. Perhaps it was not a check at all. It had been put in there but he did not think it meant much. At any rate it was a compromise which they had to accept or jeopardise the Union. Speaking a month later, Dr. Kraus, also a member of the Transvaal Parliament, declared frankly that the white people in South Africa would be traitors to their colour if they did not take away the franchise from the coloured people so soon as the new Parliament met. These things constitute an element of fear in the mind of the native and the coloured people in Cape Colony and in Natal, and the Amendments which we shall ask the House to agree to will be that the European descent qualification shall only apply to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, and that in Natal and Cape Colony the rights guaranteed to the coloured people by the Constitution granted to them by the late Queen and the Imperial Parliament shall be preserved and maintained, and their 991 right to elect coloured people continued, as it is at the present -moment. Then, in regard to the franchise, we shall ask the House to say that just as in the case of the liquor traffic and the supply to natives, so, too, in regard to the franchise, whatever Amendments will be made in the future shall not have the effect of worsening the position so far as the native is concerned, but shall reserve to him those, rights he at present enjoys, and thereby give a lead to South Africa to a further development along the line of progress. It is most interesting in this connection to remember that the heads of nearly all the religious organisations in South Africa support this contention, that the native franchise and native eligibility to be elected should not be interfered with or in any way restricted. But, in addition to religious organisations and bodies, practically the whole of the labour organisations take the same view, but the declared intention of a very large section of opinion in South Africa is to prevent the natives coming into serious competition with the white man, either in the learned professions or as property owners, or in any other sphere except that of a low-paid worker in connection with industry. It is a common-place to have it alleged of a large section of opinion in South Africa that the one interest it has in the coloured peoples there is to reduce them to the position of a landless proletariat, where they will be compelled to accept wages at anything that is offered to them in order to maintain body and soul together. Already that policy has advanced a considerable way in more than one of the States. In the Orange River Colony the restrictions are numerous and vexatious. No coloured man may engage in trade without a permit, for which he has to pay 5s. a month. The permit may confine his work to jobs within the location. He is prohibited from making bricks for sale within the town, and in a variety of ways restraints and restrictions are placed upon the educated skilled native artisan. If he desires to become a contractor, as some were during, and since the war, he is prohibited from taking contracts and so on, a clear indication being given that the object of the rulers of the Orange Free State is to prevent the natives rising into the ranks of skilled workers or into those of the educated classes. Children must leave school when they are 16, and parents will be fined £2 for each child over 16 who is not found at work.\n\n992 In Cape Colony matters are considerably better in these respects than they are in the Orange Free State or the Transvaal, and the reason is the different policy they pursued towards the coloured races, but even there there are indications of a change for the worse. The higher grade schools, I am informed, are closed against native children, even in Cape Colony, and now a well-to-do native desiring his child to receive higher grade or University education must perforce send him to this-country or to America before the education can be received. So, too, in regard to the owning of land. The land laws of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State are well known. Their object has been to prevent natives from holding land even for cultivation, and even in Cape Colony—and this shows a tendency which I am advised exists all through South Africa—a law has been passed to prevent natives owning land near to the white townships. At present the law confines them in locations-where the area which the natives may acquire for the building of houses is 40 feet square, and recently some of the more well-to-do and better educated natives-have desired to obtain sites for building outside the locations. There was a ease in which a gentleman had agreed to sell some 500 sites for building purposes to natives, 186 of these sites were sold, and the Government stepped in and prevented the sale of the others on the plea that, being so near to the white townships, sanitation and police management would be difficult. The interesting fact is that the laws and restrictions and limitations are new.\n\nA further indication of the same spirit is to be found in the fact that the Bar Association of Cape Town made an attempt to pass a regulation to prevent people other than those of European descent from qualifying to practice in the law courts. These things indicate a change coming over South African opinion, even in Cape Colony, in regard to native rights and native opportunities. In the old days, when the missionaries were practically the dominant factor, they undoubtedly stood for giving natives the chance of occupying the best positions for which their talent and education fitted them. Nowadays, under the competition that exists, and with the growth of education and of ability, the competition between white and coloured is becoming more keen, and, as a consequence, there is a very natural feeling on the part of the white that he may prevent the native from rising, lest he compete him out of 993 existence, and for that reason, as much as for any other, the provisions of this Bill should be carefuly safeguarded, so as to prevent the coloured people and the natives of South Africa from being subjected to injustice at the hands of this House after the measure has become law. Both in Cape Colony and Natal equal rights were guaranteed under the charters and the Constitution granted to those places by the House, and quite recently the Under-Secretary himself made the proud boast that if anyone is admitted under the British flag he must be a potential citizen and must sooner or later be given equal rights with all men. That is the claim we make from these benches, and seek to enforce.\n\nI will not deal with the question of native reservations, except to say that I am one of those who entirely agree that the Schedule is both wise and desirable. At the same time it will require amendments in several important particulars if it is to prove satisfactory for the natives of the different reservations and territories. We shall ask the franchise rights to be preserved where they exist against the possibility of being tampered with except in this House; that the qualification with respect to European descent shall be removed from the Cape Colony and from Natal; that the native territories and reservations shall not be under the control of the South African Parliament save with the consent of the peoples affected. We have no right, I submit, to compel these peoples who have voluntarily come under our protection to sever themselves from the Crown and put themselves under the protection of a Parliament which has yet to justify its existence and prove to those peoples that they may safely trust themselves to its care and to its guidance.\n\nI regard this Bill as being a vital step in connection with the policy for which this country has hitherto stood. I venture to say that there is no Member of the House of Commons, no matter where he sits or to which party he belongs, who will rise in his place and justify the provisions of this measure. No one has done so yet, and I do not think that anyone will do so, and if it be said that to alter the measure will be to wreck the prospects of union, I do not believe it. I refuse to believe that the Dutch people in South Africa value union so little that they would wreck the whole scheme because the House of Commons insists upon protecting the franchise for the natives in Cape Colony and removing the colour disquali- 994 fication which the Bill contains. To say that the Bill would be wrecked because of these Amendments is almost an insult to the zeal with which these men have worked to bring about Union in that vast territory. But the point is that, for the first time we are asked to write over the portals of the British Empire: \"Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\" So far as colour is concerned, this Bill lays it down that no native or person of other than European descent can ever hope to aspire to membership in the Parliament of South Africa, and if a native or a person of colour cannot hope to aspire to membership in that Parliament, to rob them of the franchise is a very short and very small step. I hope, therefore, that if only for the sake of the traditions of our dealings with natives in the past, this Bill—before it leaves the House of Commons—will be so amended as to make it a real unifying Bill in South Africa. At present it is a Bill to unify the white races, to disfranchise the coloured races, and not to promote union between the races in South Africa, but rather to still further embitter the relationships. If only from that point of view, it ought to be amended before it leaves the House.\n\n§ Mr. ELLIS J. GRIFFITH\n\nIf Members of the House will refer to the preamble of the Bill, they will see that it is to secure \"the welfare and the future progress of South Africa.\" There are 36 million natives and coloured people in South Africa, and I shall address the House from that point of view. It is, I think, a little illuminating to know how this draft Bill was prepared. The South African Convention sat from October last year until February this year. It sat with closed doors. There was no native representative at it; there was no representative of the Imperial Government present, and, although I have no doubt they would know from time to time what was going on, it was not until 9th February this year that the first draft was published, and that the native and coloured population of South Africa knew anything of this draft Constitution I take that as an important aspect of the ease, because directly the draft Constitution was published the native and coloured population met in congress after congress, to which hundreds of delegates were sent from throughout South Africa. At each conference they unanimously passed resolutions directed against the objectionable clauses of this Bill. Therefore, so far as 995 the voice of the native and coloured peoples of South Africa is concerned, we have it practically unanimous against the objectionable proposals in this Bill. The native and coloured population are now united as they have never been united before. They have hitherto been divided into hostile camps, but now, whatever their political differences in the past, they meet together to protest against the Bill, which, in their opinion, inflicts a common insult upon them all. I quite admit that we ought in discussing a matter of this kind to speak with restraint and moderation, and I hope I shall not depart from that canon which ought to guide us. The hon. Member who spoke above the Gangway, after denouncing those clauses in unmeasured terms, lifted up his hands and said, \"We cannot do anything. We must not do anything in any matter that concerns the native relations.\" I trust the House of Commons does not take that view. If it does it is a waste of time for it to discuss the Bill at all. I do not know whether we have become in regard to Colonial affairs merely a registering Committee or whether we are still a Legislative Assembly.\n\nIn this matter, at any rate, it seems to me that we are specially concerned to express our views; first of all because there are millions of people outside of the draft Constitution who have never been consulted, and who have protested against it; secondly, because the Colonies themselves ask that it should be considered; and, thirdly, because of the position of the protected states to which, as the ex-Colonial Secretary (Mr. Lyttelton) said, we are under special and solemn obligations in this matter. At any rate, whatever the position, I think we may be allowed to express our opinion on this matter. Let it be remembered that the native and coloured peoples of South Africa are not asking anything new. They might very well do that, and I think there are few in the House who would deny that if they remember the negotiations which have taken place in the past. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Birmingham (Mr. J. Chamberlain), whose absence I am sure we all regret very deeply, would, I am sure, if he had been here, have championed the native and coloured population in this matter, for a long time before the Peace of Vereeniging he said he could not purchase peace at the price of the native and coloured population if they were to 996 be deprived of their civil rights. The native and coloured population have a Press of their own, and they are following these mings carefully. The right hon. Baronet the Member for the Forest of Dean (Sir Charles W. Dilke) has stated that a great many of them are men of intelligence, learning, and education, and that before the peace of Vereeniging they thought, and rightly thought, that their interests were being safeguarded. They thought that we went to war in order to emancipate them, and that when peace came about they believed that their question was to be decided later on. They thought, and still think, that it would be decided in the sense of the promise which was given before the peace of Vereeniging. The time of the peace came, and they were abandoned to their fate. They were not allowed to have the same voice in the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal as they formerly possessed in Cape Colony. Now under this Bill it seems to me that their last chance has come. My hon. Friend said that this is a permanent settlement, and that it will take a long time to change what the Imperial Parliament has done in this respect. What are we doing? We are making them permanently ineligible for a seat in the Union Parliament as long as this Constitution is in force. Of course, we are not legislating for ever. Even a Colonial Government cannot do that. Nobody can do that, but in so far as in us lies we are putting in the Bill words that have never been put into a Bill before limiting the franchise to persons of European descent in that country. In regard to that I agree with my hon. Friend (Mr. Keir Hardie) that there has not been a speaker in the Upper or Lower House who has endeavoured to justify this exclusion. The Colonial Secretary was clear about this, and Lord Lansdowne and Lord Curzon were equally clear. All said that at was a pitiful thing that this exclusion from Parliament should be made part of the Bill. With regard to the franchise, how does the matter stand? It is quite true that the franchise is not taken away from the native and coloured voters in the Cape. General Botha said it was really too much to expect that. The ex-Colonial Secretary has said that if they lose, they also gain. That is not the point, if I may say so. At present in the Parliament to which they elect members, they elect every representative in that Parliament as long as they have votes, but in the new Parliament they will only be able to elect 997 51 out of 121. With regard to these coloured voters it must also be remembered, in considering the quota which Cape Colony sends to the Union Parliament, that the 22,000 native and coloured voters were not added in the Cape at all. It may be said that is a small matter for Cape Colony, but it is really a stigma on these men. That is to say, they are good enough to be voters in Cape Colony, but not good enough to be citizens of South Africa. That is what it really comes to, and I think that is a matter which might receive the attenion of the Imperial Parliament. It has been said that the franchise cannot be taken away by a bare majority, and that there must be a two-thirds majority. I believe I am voicing native opinion when I say that they would rather do without this protection in the Bill. The reason is obvious. You only require ten defections to get the two-thirds majority. Reference has been made to the Imperial veto in this matter. It is said that the Imperial veto will be exercised. Of course, you cannot give a guarantee for ever. I say that the Imperial veto ought not to be exercised, because in this very Bill we have compelled them to get a two-thirds majority to deprive these men of their vote. How could the Imperial Parliament afterwards impose a veto if that two-thirds majority were obtained? In fact, the insertion of this exception in the Bill is practically a declaration to the Union Parliament of South Africa, \"if you can get the two-thirds' majority we shall not exercise the veto.\" I have an authority, I think, on that point which entirely removes any advantage you may get from the veto. I think it was Mr. Merriman, the Premier of Cape Colony, who received a deputation of the Evangelical Church Council last March, which protested against the exclusion of the native from the franchise under the Draft Constitution. This is a report of the \"Cape Times\" of 8th March last, which is in conversational form:— The Premier t Even in Cape Colony the franchise could be swept away by a majority of one. Rev. A. Robson: What about the Imperial veto? The Premier: You, a Liberal, talk about the Imperial veto; in a free country too. They do not think much of the Imperial veto in South Africa. Rev. Mr. Robson: I do not believe that this Cape Parliament, by a majority of one vote, can rob these people of their rights. The Premier: I am not talking of what you believe, but of what is a fact. Father Bull: But could not a Bill be reserved? The Premier: It might be reserved, but if Great Britain put on a veto you would have a row. 998 If they once decide by a two-thirds majority to do away with this vote, I very much doubt whether the veto would be exercised by the Imperial Parliament. At any rate, whether it would or not, the words of this Bill are so clear as to the two-thirds majority that here and now is our only real opportunity of protecting this franchise. What are the reasonable Amendments that may reasonably be expected in this Bill? The most important, of course, is in reference to the words \"of European descent.\" I do not know, of course, what efforts the Government have made in this direction. Every Member of the Government who has spoken, both in the Upper House and in this House, have all condemned the insertion of these words. I do not know whether they have used their last efforts in endeavouring to eliminate them. There is one Amendment that seems to me reasonable. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Colonel Seely) has said that in this matter of the franchise there is a divergence of views. The Transvaal and the Orange River Colony do not believe in this franchise. They do not believe in its eligibility. Cape Colony does. Why should not this Bill allow a coloured or native member of the Union Parliament if he were elected by Cape Colony alone? Would not that be really an Amendment that may commend itself to the delegates in England? A great deal of the alarm and unrest of which we have heard do not lie in the provisions of this Bill, but in the attitude of the men who have really to put this Bill into operation. We have heard a great deal of the Governor-General in Council. That is simply another name for the Prime Minister. When they say that you can appeal from the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister in Council you merely appeal from the Prime Minister in one name to the Prime Minister in another; when they say that an appeal from him to Parliament can be refused by the Prime Minister, it simply means that the Prime Minister is given extraordinary powers under this Bill. As I understand it there are very few men in this House who would not wish to see these matters eliminated from the Bill if it could be done. We are told it is impossible, that the last words have been spoken, and that the Bill comes before us as an agreed compromise. I do not know whether that may be so, but I do think that a little pressure, especially if it came from both sides of the House, would have a good effect. If the Leader of the 999 Opposition had taken the same view, and the delegates saw that there was practically unanimity in the House of Commons that these questions should be dealt with I should have great hope.\n\nThey have already consented to several Amendments in the Bill, that is to say, after the second draft left the Convention in May of this year, and after it left the Parliament in South Africa for the last time, several Amendments, I will not say of a very substantial character, but from my point of view, in the right direction, and for the protection of the natives, were introduced. Under these circumstances it is felt that if there was a strong expression of opinion in this House in favour of the elimination of these words, we might hope that the delegates from the four Colonies would see their way to agree to it, because really, what does it mean? They say they love union; yet they say they would sacrifice union if these words were left in. What does this come to? It means this: that they would sacrifice the Union on the remote chance of a black or a coloured man being elected by a Cape Colony constituency. The facts of the situation are that there are in all 22,000 native and coloured voters and 190,000 white voters. Out of every 100 natives one is a voter; out of every three white men one is a voter. You have one to three on one side and one to a hundred on the other. In no single constituency in Cape Colony have they got more than one-third of the electorate, and the utmost they can ever hope to do, and the utmost they have ever attempted to do in the past, has been to hold the balance between two contending white candidates. That is the reason why the native coloured voters have taken opposite parts in politics. I do think that it is a mistake to sacrifice the real part of union for a shadowy or possible contingency that is very unlikely to happen, as they know themselves. I do hope, if it were put to them, not as the view of one party but as the views of both parties, that we are most anxious that this colour bar should not be introduced for the first time, that we think it is contrary to all the proceedings and all the traditions of our country, that the hon. Gentlemen who sit on the Front Benches below me, who are the custodians of liberty and justice, will be only too glad to use all their influence in this direction. The security of South Africa, the security of white rule in South Africa, the security of Imperial supremacy in South Africa, depends to a large extent 1000 upon the willing and active loyalty of the subject races, and we must be careful not to strain that loyalty too far. On the other hand, we ought to pursue a bolder and, in my view, a wider policy. We ought to open to them the doors of citizenship; we ought to invite their esteem, and we ought to employ their co-operation, and we ought to give them some reward and some reparation for all the wrongs and sufferings they have met in the past, some voice and some share in shaping the future destiny of South Africa.\n\nMr. BALFOUR\n\nThe House is a thin one and a weary one, yet I think there is not a single Member present, or indeed absent from this Chamber, who does not recognise that this afternoon we are discussing one of the most important events in the history of the Empire, one of the great landmarks of Imperial policy, whose consequences I believe, and, as I believe, whose excellent consequences, on the whole will be felt long after the generation which assents to this Bill has passed away and been forgotten. We have inevitably strayed from the discussion of the broad aspects of this Bill as it affects the Union of the four great Colonies of South Africa to certain aspects of the Bill which deal exclusively with the native question. I am the last person to underrate the importance of the native question. I shall have a word to say upon it directly. But do not let any Member of this House, or any member of the public, forget that the native question is but a fraction of the big question we are deciding to-day, and that what we have got to consider is whether we shall or shall not feel the broad, concrete accomplishment of the dream of successive statesmen belonging to all parties, and belonging to the different white races in South Africa, a dream which has been indulged an for more than a generation, and which now, I hope, is going to receive its final consummation. I wish in a few words to recall to the House the obvious fact that in our natural doubts and misgivings in regard to the native question we must not forget even the broad aspects of it as relating to the future policy of South Africa. Let me say one word about the most difficult and pressing trouble which has formed the main subject of our discussion this afternoon. It is quite true—it is painfully true —that the relations between the races of European descent and the dark races of Africa, whether the members of that race are to be found in their original home or 1001 whether they are to be found in the islands of the West Indies or in the Southern States of America, it is only too painfully true that the problem at present is one of the most extraordinary difficulty and complexity, that it is entirely novel in history, that there is no parallel to it in the memory and experience of mankind, and that, so far.as my knowledge goes, none of those who have studied in any detached spirit the particular shapes which that problem takes in the United States or in South Africa, or, indeed, in Africa generally, have arrived at any solution which we can look at as thoroughly conclusive and satisfactory or as likely to dominate the future development of this problem as time goes on.\n\n7.0 P.M.\n\nOf course, it is perfectly true that white races—races of European descent—have been brought into contact with races of a far lower stage of culture at other times, with the Red Indians of North America, with the natives of Australia, and with the Maoris of New Zealand. The Maoris of New Zealand have now associated themselves most loyally with their European brethren, but they are, after all, numerically, only a very.small number. The Red Indians are gradually dying out. The Australian Aborigines are even more clearly predestined to early extinction. But with the black races of Africa and those same races transported to America, for the first time we have the problem of races as vigorous in constitution, as capable of increasing in number, in contact with white civilisation. For the first time that problem has to be dealt with by peoples determinedly attached to all the constitutional traditions of liberty and freedom. That problem is new. It is coming before our brethren in the United States in a form which they, no doubt, for solid reasons made unnecessarily embarrassing, since the American Constitution started with a very crude a priori statement of the equality of mankind and a brutal application of the most rigid principles of slavery. From that unhappy contradiction it has not so far been possible for the United States to extricate themselves. As soon as they abolished one-half of the contradiction, as soon as they got rid of slavery, they were face to face with the immutable principles of their Constitution, which laid down, in true eighteenth-century language, that all men were equal. I do not believe that any man can approach this question wisely who really thinks that all men are equal in that sense. All men are, 1002 from some points of view, equal; but, to suppose that the races of Africa are in any sense the equals of men of European descent, so far as government, as society, as the higher interests of civilisation are concerned, is really, I think, an absurdity which every man who seriously looks at this most difficult problem must put out of his mind if he is to solve the problem at all.\n\nThe hon. Gentleman who has just sat down (Mr. Ellis Griffith) talked of the wrongs which the natives of South Africa have suffered at our hands. I am the last person to defend the injuries, and, in some cases, I fear, the atrocities, which in many parts of the world the stronger race has inflicted upon the weaker. But do not let us forget that everything which the weaker race has got in the nature of civilisation, it has got from the stronger. The injuries, indeed, have been great; but have the benefits been small? If the hon. Gentleman thinks—and I am sure he does—that the civilisation of the West carries with it great benefits, even to those who are incapable of rising to the full heights that we might desire, do not let him suppose all the benefits are on one side and all the wrongs on the other. That is not so. If the races of Europe have really conquered, by centuries of difficulty and travail, great rights and privileges for themselves, they have given some of those rights and some of those privileges to men quite incapable, by themselves, of fighting for them at all, or obtaining them at all. That is the plain historic truth of the situation, which it is perfect folly for us to attempt to forget. It is that very fact of the inequality of the races which makes the difficulty. If the races were equal the matter would be simple. Give them all the same rights, put them on precise political equality, but if you think, as I am forced to think, that this is an inequality, not necessarily affecting every individual, but really affecting the two races, I will not say for historic reasons—they go far back beyond the dawn of history, into the very arcana of nature, in which these different races were gradually differentiated—if anyone believes that difference is fundamental, you cannot give them equal rights without threatening the whole fabric of your civilisation. If that is true, the problem comes up before us in this extraordinarily embarrassing shape: how is a race, determined to have for itself equal rights and Constitutional freedom, who thinks that it ought to extend to every race justice, equity, 1003 kindness, forbearance, everything that education and equality of opportunity can give, to carry out that idea, if that is their idea, as I hope it is, within the framework of any Constitution? The hon. Gentleman who has just sat down, and others who have spoken to-night, all seemed to take the view that this difficulty has been solved in the Cape Constitution, and that it was a monstrous thing of this Parliament even to contemplate the possibility that the Cape Constitution might require to be remodelled. Can we be so confident that the Cape Constitution is going to be the right way of dealing with in this problem? I have considerable doubt about it. He would be a very bold man who would say that this problem, which has puzzled every thinker and statesman who has tried to solve it, has really been adequately solved by the particular expedient adopted at a particular moment by the Imperial Government, when it gave a self-governing Constitution to one very small, as it then was, fraction of our Colonial Dependencies. You cannot maintain that. The next question is, if you cannot lay down—and I am sure you cannot lay down—that the Cape solution is the solution for all time, how ought you to deal with this question?\n\nMost of the critics of the Constitution, when dealing with the larger aspect of the problem, of which alone I am speaking at this moment, appear to think that the best way in which this problem can be solved is by a rigid control, or at all events a strong control, kept by this Parliament upon the great Union Parliament which we are in the act of creating. I think that is quite an impossibility. Observe the inevitable result of a policy like that. You would "
