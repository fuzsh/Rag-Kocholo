        "text": "With the A to Z of the NRL nearing the end, we thought we’d look at another end: the NSWRFL, NSWRL and Super League clubs who are no longer with us (not including the “technically-still-alive-through-mergers” teams: the St George Dragons, Illawarra Steelers, Western Suburbs Magpies, and the Balmain Tigers).\n\nBefore you send your bomb letters: yes, I know ex-clubs doesn’t start with X, but it’s a hard letter to pick, so let’s run with it.\n\nAdelaide Rams (1997-1998)\n\nSuper League’s global ambition took the game to exotic locations, like Adelaide.\n\nDespite recruiting veteran Bronco Kerrod Walters, the Rams were mediocre: finishing second-last in 1997, and 17th (out of 20) in 1998. While still an AFL stronghold, Adelaide has their yearly NRL game between the Melbourne Storm and the Sydney Roosters, and hosted the opening Origin in 2020 (at Adelaide Oval). Despite a decent crowd, it’s hard to see an NRL side returning to aerial ping pong-obsessed South Australia.\n\nAnnandale Dales (1910-1920)\n\nIf you thought the various Gold Coast teams were bad, Annandale would give them a run for their wooden spoons (University – despite their 10 spoons – don’t count as they were amateurs and it wouldn’t be fair on them). The “Dales” collected three wooden spoons in 11 seasons, and won just two games from 1917 to 1920.\n\nCumberland (1908-1908)\n\nBefore the Parramatta Eels, Cumberland were one of the NSWRFL’s foundation clubs (wearing blue and yellow, just like the Eels do now). They won one game from eight to collect the wooden spoon. Forty years later, the Eels came along.\n\nGlebe Dirty Reds (1908-1929)\n\nWhile Glebe never won a premiership, they had a decent record: winning one minor premiership (1911) and finishing runner up four times (1911, 1912, 1915, 1922): a lot better than their rivals Annandale, Cumberland, and University.\n\nGold Coast-Tweed Giants/Gold Coast Seagulls/Gladiators/Chargers (1988-1998)\n\nRather than focus on the Gold Coast’s decade-long tale of misery (and the Seagulls’ three straight wooden spoons), let’s focus on the Chargers: the only pre-Titans team to make the finals. In their striking jade, purple, black, and gold (and with Captain Charger entertaining the crowd), they finished seventh in the ARL’s generous seven-team finals series in 1997, and beat Illawarra in week one of the finals. While the powerhouse Sydney City (formerly Eastern Suburbs) Roosters ended their run, it was a fine effort.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHunter Mariners (1997-1997)\n\nWith the Newcastle Knights becoming ARL loyalists during the Super League war, Hunter were brought in to provide some un-friendly competition. With the Knights heading towards a fairytale maiden premiership in 1997, poor old Hunter were no chance. Their highlight was making Super League’s World Club Championship final, where they were smashed by the almost invincible Brisbane Broncos. With the Melbourne Storm entering the reunited NRL in 1998, and the Chargers pulling out of a possible merger with the Mariners, Hunter disbanded. Six of the Mariners relocated to the Storm. It was a smart move, with the Storm winning the NRL premiership in 1999.\n\nNewcastle Rebels (1908-1909)\n\nEighty years before the Knights joined the NSWRL, the Rebels played two seasons in the foundation years. Playing in red and white, they finished fifth (out of nine teams) in 1908, and made the finals in 1909, but lost 20-0 to Souths.\n\nNewtown Jets (1908-1983)\n\nOne of the NSWRL’s foundation clubs, the “Bluebags”/”Baggies”/”Jets” won three premierships (1910, 1933, 1943) and were runners up seven times. Led by the late Tommy Raudonikis, they made the 1981 grand final against Parramatta, their last hurrah in the big leagues. When Tommy scored early in the second half, the Jets led 11-7. Then the Eels clicked, with two tries to Brett Kenny giving them a 20-7 win and the first of three straight premierships. The Jets live on (still at Henson Park) in the renamed Knock On Effect NSW Cup, winning the Canterbury Cup/NRL State Championship double in 2019, beating Wentworthville and Queensland’s Burleigh Bears. The Jets were also the subject of The Final Winter in 2007, arguably the best rugby league movie ever.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nNorth Sydney Bears (1908-1999)\n\nYou’ve heard of the Bad News Bears? Well, Norths could easily be the Bad Luck Bears. They won back-to-back premierships in 1921-22, and were runners-up in 1943. That was it, with the Bears not making a grand final for the next 56 years, despite being regular finalists in the nineties, and reaching a few preliminary finals.\n\nAfter the Northern Eagles died in 2002 (see below), Manly returned, and North Sydney were finished, at least in the NRL. The Bears currently play in the Knock On Effect NSW Cup, as a feeder club to the Sydney Roosters. Bears legend Greg Florimo has been pushing for the Central Coast Bears to join the NRL forever, but at the moment Perth and Brisbane are the expansion front-runners.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nNorthern Eagles (2000-2002)\n\nAn unhappy marriage between arch-rivals the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and the Bears, the Northern Eagles were doomed. Sharing their home grounds between Brookvale Oval and Gosford’s Graeme Park, they finished 12th (from 14 teams) in 2000; 10th in 2001 (missing the finals by three points); and ninth in 2002 (missing the finals by one point).\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nSouth Queensland Crushers (1995-1997)\n\nOn paper, South Queensland were meant to give Queenslanders an alternative to a Broncos side at their arrogant peak, and provide regular footy at Lang Park; in reality, the Crushers had no chance. Despite recruiting veterans Trevor Gillmeister and Mario Fenech (“The Falcon” was born while he was at the Crushers), they never got close to the finals, finishing last in 1996 and 1997. A young Clinton Schifcofske played two years for the Crushers, before playing 72 games for Parramatta, 139 for Canberra, two Origins for Queensland, and 23 Super Rugby games for the Queensland Reds, before finishing his career with the Crusaders in the UK Super League. It wasn’t all bad for the Crushers though, winning the 1996 President’s Cup premiership.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nUniversity (1920-1937)\n\nLike the plot of a bad sports movie, the “Students” were a team of amateurs against professionals. Unlike most bad sports movies, there was no horribly-scripted, slow-motion fairytale for University, collecting 10 wooden spoon.\n\nWestern/Perth Reds (1995-1997)\n\nWhile a $10 million debt (from having to pay visiting teams’ airfares) killed the Reds after just three seasons, Perth have been high on the NRL’s relocation plans ever since: last year’s Origin at Optus Stadium was sold out (even outranking their precious AFL), they hosted this year’s NRL Nines, and the West Coast Pirates look ready to go. While the Reds had the likes of Mark Geyer, Brad Mackay, Rodney Howe, Robbie Kearns, and Julian O’Neill, they quickly fell away after a promising debut year (finishing 11th and missing the finals by two points)."
