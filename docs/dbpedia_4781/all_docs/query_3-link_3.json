        "text": "The Parramatta and Newcastle rugby league clubs made their debuts in the NSW rugby league competition respectively in 1947 and 1988. Or did they? In fact clubs from both these districts were among the nine foundation clubs that first played in the Sydney rugby league competition in 1908, right at the get-go of the code in Australia.\n\nThe participation of Newcastle and Cumberland turned out to be of fleeting duration. Newcastle’s entry in 1908 wasn’t smoothly achieved given the opposition to organised rugby league in the district from the entrenched rugby (union) fraternity in Newcastle. In its favour was the fact that the still fledging New South Wales rugby league was keen to expand the comp beyond the Sydney metropolitan boundary. Through the 11th hour efforts of a small group of determined Novocastrians, covertly undertaken, Newcastle was able to put a team together just in time for the inaugural rugby league season.\n\nNewcastle away all season\n\nWith the Newcastle club unable to play any of its games in 1908 at home (no suitable local ground available), the NSW RL agreed to pay for the players’ travel and accomodation in Sydney each weekend. Newcastle, dubbed the Rebels, were competitive from the start, finishing the season in 5th place and just missing the semi finals (biggest win, 37–0 against Cumberland). Captain Stan Carpenter, star forward Pat Walsh and winger Bill Bailey were all rewarded with Australian representation.\n\nThe next season, 1909, was the Novocastrians’ last season in the Sydney comp, though this had nothing to do with the team’s on-field performance. Newcastle went one better than 1908, making the semis and inflicting the solitary defeat on that year’s premiers South Sydney (5–0) at Newcastle Showground. It was the Newcastle club who withdrew itself from the Competition so as to concentrate on developing the local competition in the Newcastle and Hunter district.\n\nWests Rugby breakaway\n\nCumberland (officially called Central Cumberland*, nickname: the Fruitpickers), the precursor to Parramatta in the NSW RL was also a foundation club in 1908 but their participation lasted only the one season. Unlike the Newcastle Rebels Cumberland were spectacularly unsuccessful, winning just one game in 1908, 14–6 against Western Suburbs. The Cumberland club was late in forming itself, missing Round 1 of the season, the impetus for its establishment were disgruntled members of the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club who formed the nucleus of the playing group. Cumberland managed to narrowly avoid the “wooden spoon” in its single season because it was awarded an extra bye for the absent first round. The club’s standout player was fullback Harry Bloomfield (also the captain) who represented NSW against Queensland.\n\nCumberland’s team colours—royal blue and gold—were adopted by the Parramatta Eels Club when it was came into the top flight of Sydney Rugby League in 1947⌖. Cumberland unable to field a team, let alone a competitive one, disbanded after the 1908 season, to be eventually replaced in 1910 by the new Annandale club.\n\nFootnote: Giltinan’s crucial spadework\n\nJJ Giltinan, foundation secretary of the NSW Rugby League, played the instrumental coordinating role in getting Newcastle and Cumberland into the competition (as he did later with Annandale).\n\n————————————————\n\n* “Central Cumberland” was chosen as the team name in keeping with the name of the local club in Sydney grade cricket\n\n⌖ Parramatta’s home ground was called Cumberland Oval (today the site of Parramatta Stadium)\n\n🏉 🏉 🏉\n\nBibliography\n\n‘Re-introducing the rebels of 1908’, Zac Nissan, 13-Oct-2121, www.newcastleknights.com.au\n\n‘Newcastle RLFC (1908-09)’, Sean Fagan, www.rl1908.com\n\nCumberland RLFC (1908-09)’, Sean Fagan, www.rl1908.com"
