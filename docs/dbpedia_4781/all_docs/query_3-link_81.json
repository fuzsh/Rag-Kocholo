        "text": "On 15 August, 1908, a rugby league side representing Australia boarded the RMS Macedonia at Sydney’s Circular Quay and, along with colonial cargo of a different kind –1,915 bales of wool, 420 tons of lead bullion, 2,000 crates of rabbits and 8,000 carcasses of mutton and lamb — set sail for a playing tour of Britain. Ahead of them was an itinerary, inconceivable today, of 45 matches.\n\nNone of the group of 35, led and financed by Sydney entrepreneur James Joseph Giltinan, would surely have foreseen the extent of the hardships that awaited them. Some, however, such as Australia’s star player Dally Messenger, did wonder that for all the boldness, excitement and optimism surrounding the undertaking if they were getting a little ahead of themselves.\n\nIt wasn’t just that having a touring party of 35 and a 45-match itinerary seemed, in both cases, excessive­ – and Messenger later claimed to have expressed doubts along these lines to Giltinan before the tour. There was also the concern that you couldn’t know what sort of weather a north England winter would throw at you (that is, would it be bad or really bad?), or whether the locals would have much appetite for another Antipodean team. Australia’s amateur rugby union team, the Wallabies, would be touring at the same time, and competing for a similar audience, while it was only a year earlier that New Zealand’s professional All Golds (also featuring Messenger) visited the country. How much interest would the Kangaroos generate?\n\nOn top of all that was the not insignificant matter of Australia’s players being only recently acquainted with the code’s distinct rules. The Macedonia left the P&O Wharf before the first season of rugby league in Australia had even finished. In fact, it was only five months earlier that the rulebook put together by the game’s governing body in Britain, the Northern Union, first lobbed on Australian shores. And it was just four months since Easts and Newtown played the opening match of the New South Wales Rugby League competition (which gave the Sydney Sportsman cause to humorously praise its differences from rugby union: “The alteration in the rules do away with a lot of the stuff that used to make spectators go and drown their sorrows at the bar.”)\n\nBut under the direction and ambition of the game’s founding fathers in Australia, Giltinan, beloved cricketer Victor Trumper, and Labor Party figure Harold Hoyle, Australian rugby league’s foundations were sunk quickly into the Sydney sandstone and the game began with almost evangelical zeal. The urge to link up with likeminded souls in the north of England, and to cement and legitimise the working man’s game, must have been strong. So full speed ahead. The Mother Country awaited. What could go wrong?\n\nAfter a six week journey via the Suez Canal – during which time, at least until the ship hit the sweltering tropics, the players added boiler stoking to their on-board exercise routine – the Australians arrived at Tilbury Docks in England at the start of what would prove one of the coldest autumn-winter periods in recent times; an interminable period of snow, black-ice and coat-piercing wind. Not the type of conditions that lead a person to consider it a capital idea to pay a shilling to watch a game of football from an exposed terrace. Especially when a lesser amount – a sixpence – was the usual going rate.\n\nAt the same time the north of England, the heartland of rugby league, was suffering through a strike that had shut down cotton mills in Yorkshire and Lancashire. And with no employment, many of the area’s labourers didn’t have the disposable income to spend on spectator sport. So in hindsight, the Kangaroos were up against it before a ball had been kicked.\n\nFor all that the tour started well and the Yorkshire press was generous in its praise of the team. But even among standout players like try-scoring savant Jimmy Devereux, Pony Halloway, Dan Frawley, Sandy Pearce and captain Dinny Lutge, one player attracted more than his share of attention. “In Messenger,” one scribe wrote, “they have perhaps the most brilliant three-quarter of the present day – a man with the speed of a greyhound who can dodge, tackle, kick in any position, and hoodwink an opponent even in a confined space.”\n\nIn a buoyant mood, the Kangaroos, by now getting the £1-a-week stipend promised to them by Giltinan, travelled to south Wales for the Kangaroos’ opening match against new Northern Union side Mid-Rhondda. In front of more than 7,000 spectators they won 20-6 thanks in part to that man Messenger who besides drop-kicking a penalty goal from his own side of halfway, scored a thrilling solo try from midfield. The local press praised the Australians claiming they were better than the Wallabies. The assessment would have hurt the Wallabies much less than the defection of Messenger from union to league a year earlier as proved by the NSWRU striking the player from its official records in 1907 (and not reinstating him until 2007).\n\nThe Kangaroos, who would play in maroon-and-blue hooped jerseys, went on to win 14 of their next 19 matches (including games against NU champions, Hunslet, and a NU representative team) prior to the first Test. Despite this winning record, signs of the coming gloom were starting to show. Between the worsening weather, the labour strike, the ticket prices insisted upon by Giltinan, and a growing impression in the press that, Messenger aside, the Kangaroos were not that impressive after all, crowds and gate-takings were below expectations. The Northern Union had guaranteed the touring party £3,000 but already Giltinan had begun to wonder if that was going to cover it.\n\nAround this time, as a cost-saving exercise, Giltinan was forced to reduce the players’ weekly allowance from £1-a-week to 10 shillings – meaning, ironically, that the professional Kangaroos were now getting less daily allowance than their Wallaby counterparts. And like modern day backpackers (though better dressed) the team sometimes caught overnight trains simply to avoid the cost of a night’s accommodation. Giltinan even moved the team from more expensive hotels into a vacant mansion at Southport where he helped the housekeeping staff in order to keep costs down. And with a couple of pianos in the mansion, and a few players capable of playing them (now there’s a stark reminder of how times have changed) falling morale was held at bay. But only temporarily.\n\nAs the snow fell, the cold bit, injuries niggled, and crowds stayed away, the spirit within the squad decayed. In his excellent The Rugby Rebellion, The Divide of League and Union, Sean Fagan reports that the Australians began bickering amongst themselves, with some outside the “clique clubs of Easts, Souths and Norths” believing they weren’t getting enough game time – which illustrates, starkly, the folly of Giltinan insisting on a 35-player squad. And amongst it all NU clubs began circling the troubled Australians like carrion despite being warned not to do so until the tour ended. All this before a Test had been played.\n\nThat first England v Australia encounter took place on 12 December at Park Royal, London. The choice of London, along with that of Newcastle and Birmingham for the second and third Tests respectively, was controversial. Showing that, with league, some things never change, the Northern Union was accused of robbing the game’s true fans in the north of the chance to see the Tests by using the games for what today would be called a branding exercise. The NU’s reply, however, pointed out that it was trying to avoid overkill, what with the Kangaroos scheduled to play no fewer than 27 matches in Lancashire and Yorkshire.\n\nIn any case, the first Test was one of the tour’s highlights. The game, which began with the Kangaroos delivering a pre-match war cry – probably more of a theatrical, crowd-engaging touch than heartfelt warning given it was an Indigenous chant used by warriors on Stradbroke Island — ended in a 22-22 draw. Australia had gamely fought back from a 17-5 deficit to push ahead 22-20 before a late England penalty levelled the scores. Featuring a hat-trick of tries to Devereux, the Test was considered one of the best games of rugby league yet played. Unfortunately, partly due to a clash with some major union and football fixtures, there were only 2,200 people in attendance, way down on expectations. So instead of the Kangaroos making a profit from the match their piddling £22 gate takings fell well short of the £40 pounds it cost to bring the team to London from their northern base.\n\nUnfortunately for the Australians, the New Year brought more of the same and gate-takings, by now taking on as much, if not more, significance than the scores, continued to fall short of costs. It was soon apparent that the Australians’ finances were dangerously stretched. Giltinan, who had borrowed £2,000 to help finance the trip – and only bought one-way tickets for the touring party figuring gate receipts would pay their way home – must have started to feel his chest tighten by the day. And to think he'd promised his players a share of the tour's profits.\n\nThe second Test proved to be the eye of the storm, from a financial perspective at least. Held at Newcastle’s St James’ Park, 22,000 spectators turned up to see England prevail 15-5 thanks in part to a fine performance from their captain and gun three-quarter, Salford’s James Lomas, who scored a try and kicked three goals. Messenger at least provided his customary highlight, scoring a mesmeric solo try after weaving through the opposition like the Tyne through Newcastle. As disappointed as the Australians were, the loss was tempered by gate takings of £568. In hindsight however, it was not a sign of the tour’s enduring life but rather its death throes.\n\nFollowing the second Test the Australians played an unofficial Test against England just a week later at Celtic’s Parkhead and in a nice touch the visitors were fitted out in the football club’s green-and-white hooped jerseys. But typical of the bad luck that bedeviled the tour, the day was ruined by high winds and driving rain and there were only 3,000 spectators in attendance to witness the 17-17 draw, a result the Kangaroos salvaged from a 17-2 deficit. That they got so close to snatching it was largely down to the goal-kicking prowess of Messenger whose skill in this department saw him receive lucrative offers from football clubs such as Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, offers he turned down in part because he’d promised his mother he’d return to Australia at the conclusion of the tour.\n\nThe Parkhead comeback was Australia’s last gasp and the team would fail to win any of its remaining 10 matches, including the third Test, which finished 6-5, a game Messenger missed due to a knee injury. So almost seven months since leaving Circular Quay, and with, despite everything, a respectable tour record of 17 wins, six draws and 22 losses behind them, the wide blue skies of Australia beckoned. But how to get home? Giltinan, a shattered man, was broke, all but forcing the Northern Union to secure the Kangaroos’ passage on the RMS India.\n\nIn May 1909, Giltinan and his squad of pioneering Kangaroos docked in Sydney where there was much to digest. In news that brings to mind the phrase ‘out of the frying pan and into the fire’ Giltinan discovered that, in absentia, he had been ousted from his position of secretary with the NSWRL due to concerns about the organisation’s finances. As he absorbed that blow he discovered the inevitable, that the tour’s financial losses had bankrupted him and, as the NSWRL withdrew its support, Giltinan was lost to the game for a few years (although, in just recognition of his services to the game, his name would later be given to the premiership shield).\n\nMeantime, the Kangaroos, minus half a dozen players who had stayed on to take up contracts with UK clubs, were somewhat surprised – and surely not pleasantly – to discover the NSWRL had scheduled two games for them, against a Rest of NSW team, just days after they returned. But many of the tourists, like Messenger, didn’t play due to ongoing injury. In fact, Messenger, and at least half a dozen others, would sit out the entire 1909 season to recuperate, while a few of the 1908-09 tourists, like Dan Crawley, would return to England to play club football.\n\nMinus their star power, and debilitated by a financially disastrous first year, rugby league in Sydney almost floundered at that point. Foundation club Cumberland was absorbed by Western Suburbs, and crowds for season two of the NSWRL could be measured in the hundreds. But just like those intrepid Kangaroo tourists, just like Giltinan, rugby league would find a way to survive. It always does.\n\nThe author acknowledges source material including:\n\nA Centenary of Rugby League, The Definitive Story of the Game in Australia, by Ian Heads and David Middleton\n\nThe Rugby Rebellion, The Divide of League and Union, by Sean Fagan\n\nThe Master, The Life and Times of Dally Messenger, by Sean Fagan and Dally Messenger III"
