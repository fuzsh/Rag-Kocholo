Of course, adults smiled tolerantly at this, not realising that the boy will soon be a man, and that the sentiments imbibed in his formative years are likely to remain with him in after life, to fructify as deeds when opportunity offers.1\n\nThat was how one Irish nationalist activist, Colonel Joseph V. Lawless, remembered the revolutionary boys of Na Fianna Éireann, or the Irish National Boy Scouts. The Fianna’s founders, Countess Constance Markievicz and Bulmer Hobson, had two main aims when they established this youth organisation in Dublin in 1909. They wanted to provide an Irish nationalist alternative to British uniformed youth groups operating in Ireland and to prepare Irish boys for their future role in the Irish struggle for independence from Great Britain. They succeeded in both aims. Irish historians have increasingly referred to a series of events that took place during the period c. 1913–23 as the ‘Irish Revolution’, though this term and the exact time frame involved remain contentious.2 These events include the 1913 Dublin Lockout, the 1916 Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence (or Anglo-Irish War, 1919–21) and the Irish Civil War (1922–23). Serving and former members of the Fianna participated in all of these events. By the end of the Irish Revolution, Ireland had been partitioned into two distinct political entities: the effectively independent twenty-six-county Irish Free State and the devolved government of six-county Northern Ireland, which remained in political union with Britain within the United Kingdom.\n\n2\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nNa Fianna Éireann became the military trailblazers of the Irish nationalist movement in the early twentieth century. In 1914, Patrick Pearse proclaimed that ‘if the Fianna had not been founded in 1909, the [Irish] Volunteers of 1913 would never have arisen’.3 The Fianna were probably the first Irish nationalist group to begin military training in the twentieth century. This training enabled senior Fianna officers to serve as instructors when the Irish Volunteers were formed in November 1913. This adult paramilitary organisation, or citizens’ militia, was established as a nationalist counterblast to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), which had been founded in January 1913 to assert Ulster unionist opposition to home rule for Ireland. Pearse’s proclamation can be taken one step further. Without the foundation of the Fianna and the Irish Volunteers, the 1916 Easter Rising and the subsequent War of Independence would not have occurred, military personnel with the requisite training and militant mindset being essential for the execution of rebellions and guerrilla wars. The Fianna and the Irish Volunteers were designed to prepare Irish boys and men physically and mentally to engage in combat against British government forces in Ireland as part of the struggle for Irish independence. The Irish Volunteers may have been formed as a response to the UVF, but the Fianna began their military training four years prior to the establishment of both adult volunteer forces. Thus, the purpose of this book is to examine how what started as an Irish nationalist scouting organisation served not only as a conduit for the involvement of youth in the Irish Revolution but also as the military vanguard of this period of nationalist insurgency in Ireland.\n\nNA FIANNA ÉIREANN IN IRISH HISTORIOGRAPHY Until recently, Na Fianna Éireann tended to be mentioned only in passing, if at all, in studies of the Irish Revolution. It is only in the past decade or so that the history of the Fianna has been the subject of popular and scholarly studies. The exception is a doctoral thesis submitted in 1981, the year in which ten republican hunger strikers died in prison in Northern Ireland. John R. Watts’s unpublished PhD thesis examined the Fianna as a case study of a political youth organisation, covering the group’s history from its inception in 1909 up to 1981.4 More recent publications began with J. Anthony Gaughan’s 2006 study Scouting in Ireland, which considers the history of three Irish scouting movements: the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts, the Fianna and the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland.5 To mark the 2009 centenary of\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n3\n\nthe Fianna’s foundation, Damien Lawlor published a narrative history entitled Na Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909 to 1923.6 In 2014, Eamon Murphy began to document online the history of the Fianna in the period 1909–23 through illustrated blog entries on topics such as individual Fianna members, various troops and specific historical events.7 I started to publish a series of scholarly articles on aspects of the Fianna’s history in academic journals and edited collections from 2008 onwards, an undertaking that grew out of my doctoral research on Fianna co-founder Bulmer Hobson and has culminated in the present monograph.8 The recent growth in historiography on the Fianna has been fuelled by the greater availability of primary source material, beginning with the opening of the Bureau of Military History (BMH) collection in 2003, as well as public interest generated by the current decade of centenaries commemorating the events of Ireland’s revolutionary era.9 Increasing academic research into the history of Irish children and childhood has also played a role.10 All three of these factors are evident in the Fianna’s heightened profile in relation to the 1916 Rising. For instance, Fearghal McGarry included a chapter on the Fianna in Rebels: Voices from the Easter Rising, a book of edited extracts from BMH witness statements.11 Two young men associated with the Fianna, Con Colbert and Sean Heuston, have been the subjects of biographies as part of the O’Brien Press’s ongoing 16 Lives series to commemorate the lives of the sixteen men who were executed for their roles in relation to the Easter Rising.12 Furthermore, RTÉ broadcaster Joe Duffy excavated the lives and deaths of three Fianna members, Sean Healy, James Fox and James Kelly, in Children of the Rising, a study of the forty children aged sixteen and under who died during the 1916 rebellion. Children of the Rising has emerged as one of the most popular books published so far during the decade of centenaries.13 The present monograph on Na Fianna Éireann aims to provide a scholarly yet accessible account of the nationalist youth organisation’s early history and contribution to the Irish Revolution during the period 1909–23, situating it within the wider international context of uniformed youth groups in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The book not only builds upon the research of the authors noted previously but also revises and extends my own previously published articles on the subject. The remainder of this chapter and the ones that follow take a thematic approach to the Fianna’s history during the revolutionary era by exploring in turn the organisation’s broader international and national contexts, inception, development, membership,\n\n4\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nrange of activities, print propaganda and military contribution to the Irish Revolution. It is my hope that this monograph will encourage other scholars to delve into the history of the Fianna to produce, for example, regional studies of the youth group or research on the organisation post 1923.\n\nTHE ADVENT OF UNIFORMED YOUTH GROUPS Na Fianna Éireann were an Irish nationalist manifestation of the ‘pseudomilitary’ youth groups that arose in Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These organisations were part of the cult of discipline, training and manliness that grew out of the increasing anticipation of the coming war in Europe.14 For instance, during the First World War, about 30,000 Galician men served in the Polish Legions or their Ukrainian counterpart, the United Sich Riflemen, both of which had grown out of scouting, sporting or paramilitary groups that had been formed in the previous decade.15 Uniformed youth groups were also a reaction to a widely perceived fin-de-siècle ‘decadence’.16 In the early years of the twentieth century, many Germans worried that ‘middle-class boys were effeminate’ and ‘the country lacked virile soldiers’.17 Similarly, the British army’s poor performance against a force of South African farmers during the Boer War (1899–1902) had provoked concern that Britain was in a state of decline. Fearing that they were losing their competitive edge in industrial and military affairs and that their populations were deteriorating both physically and morally, Western countries like Germany and Britain began to concern themselves with the health, education and moral welfare of the new generation.18 Uniformed youth groups were one way of addressing this concern. The best known of these youth groups was the international Boy Scout movement founded by Robert Baden-Powell in 1908. A British army officer who specialised in reconnaissance and scouting, BadenPowell started this movement in response to the interest that boys had shown in his 1899 army training manual, Aids to Scouting. He was also inspired by the model of the Boys’ Brigade, which was launched by William Alexander Smith in 1883 in Glasgow.19 Smith was a businessman and an officer in the Volunteers, a British part-time military force that was later replaced by the Territorial Army.20 He used military drill and discipline as a way of providing guidance to the boys who attended his Scottish Free Church Sunday School.21 Smith’s example also inspired the formation of the Church Lads’ Brigade for Anglicans, the Jewish Lads’ Brigade and the Catholic Boys’ Brigade.22 Baden-Powell,\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n5\n\nin contrast, put less overt emphasis on militarism. Instead, he focused on outdoor activities and personal development in order not only to train boys to be better citizens but to counter what he saw as the moral and physical decline of the upcoming generation.23 The impetus for the outdoor element of scouting came from the US-based naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton and his Woodcraft movement, which promoted outdoor life and the lore of Native American tribes. Baden-Powell and Seton met in 1906, sharing their respective ideas on youth groups. Seton co-founded the Boy Scouts of America, subsuming his own Woodcraft movement into the new group; however, he objected to the Scout movement’s emphasis on patriotism and was forced out of the American organisation in 1915.24 Whether Baden-Powell’s main concern prior to 1920 was training citizens or future soldiers has sparked much scholarly debate.25 Tensions within the early Scout movement, as exemplified by Seton and others, suggest that Baden-Powell initially sought to train both. Girls took an early interest in the scouting movement with a large group attending the first big Scout rally at Crystal Palace in London in September 1909. Baden-Powell was opposed to including girls in his scouting organisation because he thought they would inhibit boys from joining. Instead, his sister Agnes formed the Girl Guides in 1910, initially attracting about 8,000 girls.26 When the Girl Guides were first established, the organisation’s primary goal was to create ‘good wives and mothers for the British Empire’, seeking to nurture femininity and domesticity in girls. Such a conservative goal may have contributed to the Girl Guides’ failure in their early years to expand as quickly as the scouting movement for boys.27 In response, Baden-Powell took over as chairman in 1915 and revamped the Girl Guides by developing a more efficient organisational structure and recruiting younger women into the movement, such as his wife Olave.28 Richard A. Voeltz has argued that the context of the First World War also played an important part in increasing the popularity of the Girl Guides in Britain: ‘The new freedom associated with the war experience changed the common ways of thinking about what constituted appropriate behaviour outside the home for young women and girls, allowing the Guides to incorporate all the elements of the original scouting scheme … without fear of bruising their femininity.’29 As a result, Girl Guides could participate in signalling, drill and camping like their brothers, as well as contribute to the war effort through more traditional feminine activities such as fundraising, knitting socks for soldiers and volunteering in hospitals.30\n\n6\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nUNIFORMED YOUTH GROUPS IN IRELAND British uniformed youth groups soon established themselves in Ireland. Although the Boys’ Brigade came to Ireland first, the Boy Scout movement spread more quickly. The first Irish companies of Smith’s Boys’ Brigade were founded in Belfast in 1888 and Dublin in 1891, followed by the establishment of a branch of the Catholic Boys’ Brigade in Dublin in March 1894.31 Boy Scout troops were in existence in Bray, County Wicklow, Dublin city and county, and Belfast from early 1908. Irish girls also joined in the female equivalent of scouting with the formation of Ireland’s first official Girl Guide company in Harold’s Cross in Dublin in 1911. Members of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, such as the 12th Earl of Meath, supported the new youth movement from the beginning, often providing leadership and camping facilities on their estates.32 Not everyone in Ireland greeted this new British cultural import with such open arms, especially at a time when nationalists were actively engaged in combating cultural assimilation through the revival of aspects of traditional Irish culture, such as the Irish language and the sport of hurling. Some Irish nationalists, however, could see the value of Baden-Powell’s vision of training male youth for their future roles as citizens and soldiers, but not in the service of Britain and its Empire. Among the advanced Irish nationalists who viewed British uniformed youth groups as a threat that could be turned into an opportunity was Arthur Griffith (1871–1922), founder of the Sinn Féin (ourselves) movement. In 1903, he condemned the Catholic Boys’ Brigades as a recruiting ground for the British army, but recognised that if ‘properly conducted’, boys’ brigades could be turned into ‘a great national force’, contributing to ‘the intellectual and physical good of the young’.33 Two Protestant Irish nationalist activists, Countess Constance Markievicz (née Gore-Booth; 1868–1927) and John Bulmer Hobson (1883–1969), also shared this view. In August 1909, they founded Na Fianna Éireann in Dublin in order to counteract the growing popularity and influence of the Boy Scout movement and the Boys’ Brigade in Ireland. Na Fianna Éireann offered its mainly male membership a combination of military training, outdoor pursuits and Irish cultural activities. The youth group later proved its value to the Irish Volunteers by providing the adult organisation with trained instructors, leaders and members. The Fianna would become the best known and most significant Irish nationalist manifestation of the uniformed ‘pseudomilitary’ youth group in the early twentieth century.\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n7\n\nMarkievicz and Hobson were not the only Irish nationalists to recognise the value and appeal of uniformed youth groups during this period. In late 1911, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) established its own juvenile organisation, the Hibernian Boys’ Brigade, which was aimed at ‘all Catholic boys of Irish parentage, between the ages of 10 and 17’.34 The AOH was a Catholic benevolent society that supported home rule for Ireland. It may have started the Hibernian Boys’ Brigade as part of its efforts to expand its appeal beyond adult men and to ensure future members. From 1910, the AOH had provided women with the opportunity to join a Ladies’ Auxiliary and, as Senia Pašeta has noted, ‘by 1914 there were apparently several hundred branches of the Ladies’ Auxiliary throughout Ireland’.35 Every division of the AOH was encouraged to start the Boys’ Brigade in its district if the population warranted it, in the hope that Brigade membership would give boys insight into the activities of the AOH and serve as a feeder for future members of the parent organisation. Members engaged in physical and military drill, participated in public processions, developed their Irish language skills, held concerts and played football in the Dublin Schools League, among other activities.36 Michael F. Ryan, who joined the Waterford branch of the Hibernian Boys’ Brigade when he was about nine years of age, recalled attending first aid lectures at the AOH Hall on O’Connell Street and participating in route marches.37 The year 1912 saw the formation of the Irish National Girl Scouts which changed their name to the Clann na Gael Girl Scouts in 1915 when the organisation became an auxiliary to the Hibernian Rifles. May Kelly (1901–64) and her sister Elizabeth initially started this uniformed youth group with the help of fellow Drumcondra resident Seamus McGowan (born 1887).38 McGowan had previously been involved in organising Fianna troops on the north side of Dublin.39 The Clann na Gael Girl Scouts catered for girls between the ages of eight and sixteen years. Like the Fianna, the organisation offered its members military training, camping trips and Irish cultural activities. The latter included Irish language lessons and the playing of camogie, the female equivalent of hurling. This girls’ group mainly functioned in Dublin, but branches were later formed elsewhere, such as Cork, Tullamore, Athlone and Derry.40 Clann na Gael shared a meeting hall at 28 North Frederick Street in Dublin with the Hibernian Rifles. The latter organisation was the military wing of the Irish-American Alliance, the more radical, less sectarian section of the AOH.41 The Hibernian, an AOH publication, ‘declared it was as much the duty of Irish girls, “to learn the art of war, so as to be able to fight for your country as it is for boys”’.42 The Clann\n\n8\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nna Gael Girl Scouts became more militant than the AOH’s organisations for boys and women. In terms of both political motivation and exposure to physical danger, the courier duties performed during the 1916 Easter Rising by Clann na Gael member Mary McLoughlin were a far cry from the voluntary social work and contributions to the Great War effort on the home front undertaken by lady Hibernians.43 When Clann na Gael spread to Cork in 1917, it was viewed as ‘a junior auxiliary’ of the nationalist women’s organisation Cumann na mBan and ‘on a par with the Fianna Boy Scouts’.44 In later years, the Clann na Gael Girl Scouts were clearly aligned with republicanism and supported the anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, a stance shared by Na Fianna Éireann as an organisation.45 Other political persuasions in Ireland, such as the trade union movement, also had their uniformed youth groups. The Irish Citizen Army (ICA), which was established in November 1913 to protect protesting workers during the Dublin Lockout, formed its own Scout Corps in June 1914 as part of a broader initiative to improve the efficiency of the army after the Lockout’s failure. As John R. Watts has suggested, the decision to form a junior section of the ICA was likely influenced by the example of the role played by the Fianna within the advanced nationalist movement; the Scout Corps was viewed as a training ground for future ICA recruits and a way of including boys within the wider trade union family. Markievicz joined Seamus McGowan in taking a leading role in the establishment and subsequent organisation of the ICA Scout Corps, which attracted a core group of twenty boys who were trained in military drill, marksmanship and first aid. In contrast to the Fianna and despite being called ‘scouts’, the corps did not include woodcraft or camping as part of its training programme.46 Like members of the Fianna and Clann na Gael, the ICA scouts accompanied their adult counterparts on marches, manoeuvres and parades.47 Irish youths who supported the continuance of the political union between Ireland and Great Britain tended to join British organisations, so there was less perceived need to establish specifically Irish unionist or loyalist uniformed youth groups. For instance, members of the Boys’ Brigade and the Church Lads’ Brigade demonstrated their commitment to unionism and opposition to the third home rule bill through their participation in public parades in County Armagh in 1912.48 In Belfast, the Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV) were formed on 10 September 1912 to continue among older teens and young men the training and discipline provided by such youth groups. According to the YCV’s inaugural\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n9\n\npresident, Belfast Lord Mayor R. J. McMordie, MP, ‘the young men of our country have been handicapped in the past in not having any general organisation capable of continuing the good work done by the Boys’ Brigade, Church Lads’ Brigade, and the Boys’ Scouts Movement’.49 The 1st Battalion of the YCV was later amalgamated into the UVF in 1914.50 In rural Ulster, there were links between the Baden-Powell Boy Scouts and the UVF.51 British uniformed youth groups provided a template that was imitated and in some cases subverted by similar Irish groups. Despite their differing political loyalties, the Fianna, the Clann na Gael Girl Scouts, the ICA Scout Corps and the YCV all served as conduits into adult paramilitary organisations in Ireland. These Irish uniformed youth groups and their adult counterparts were manifestations of the spirit of popular militarism that took hold in Europe and beyond in the years leading up to the First World War.\n\nTHE PURPOSES OF UNIFORMED YOUTH GROUPS Many of the youth groups formed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were designed to keep young working-class boys off the streets and provide them with a leisure-time activity that promoted middle-class values of order and discipline. The Boys’ Brigade is a good example. Its founder, Smith, ‘reasoned that a new uniformed organisation appealing to a boy’s sense of patriotism and martial spirit would serve as a useful instrument for a primarily religious end’.52 In this case, order and discipline included the practice of one’s religion. One early Brigade member recognised the important function that the organisation served for his age cohort: When we reached thirteen most of us felt we were too big for the Sunday School, and there was a gap of a few years until we were able to join the YMCA [Young Men’s Christian Association] at seventeen. To fill this gap period, many working-class boys ran wild, became hooligans and street-corner loafers. What else was there for them in those days, to do?53\n\nMany teenage boys welcomed the advent of uniformed youth groups because they gave them something enjoyable and constructive to do with their free time. The ‘uniformed’ aspect of such youth groups chimed with the romantic view of the military prevalent in the years prior to the First World War.\n\n10\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nIn the British context, the establishment of uniformed youth groups revealed an underlying adult view of youth, particularly working-class youth, as a problem that required a solution. Influenced by his experience of the Boer War, Baden-Powell’s decision to start the Boy Scouts reflected his fears of the moral and physical ‘degeneration of the young and for the survival of the British Empire which they would have to maintain’.54 One anonymous fan of the new movement argued that ‘in the next generation there should be no overgrown lads standing idly and foolishly at the street corners, gaping after they know not what, smoking cigarettes … there will be a new race of boys in England when the Scouts of today have little Scouts of their own’.55 Thus, uniformed youth groups were seen as an important tool in the renewal of British society. As John Springhall has noted, ‘the development of “character” and “esprit de corps” found in the [British] public schools was to be extended to the “lower ranks” in society through the agencies of the various boys’ brigades and, later, the Boy Scouts’.56 Such youth groups would transmit middle-class values of order and discipline to working-class boys, values that would serve the state well during time of war. Markievicz in particular recognised the value and appeal of the activities offered by the boys’ brigades and the Boy Scouts but wanted to provide Irish boys with an Irish nationalist alternative to what she viewed as British imperialist bodies. In essence, she was less interested in keeping Irish boys off the streets than in keeping them out of the meeting halls of British youth groups operating in Ireland. Where Baden-Powell and other British youth leaders saw boys as a potential resource for the British army and for the maintenance of the British Empire, Markievicz and Hobson saw them as a potential resource for the Irish nationalist movement. The Fianna would provide members with the military training and nationalist nurturing to enable them to play an important role in the struggle for Irish independence. The organisation proffered a combination of political indoctrination and youth empowerment. The Fianna served not only as a focus for the spare time and energy of nationalist youth but also as a recruiting ground for the future soldiers of the Irish Revolution and community leaders of an independent Ireland. The youth group enabled its members to gain skills in organisation and governance in much the same way that older Irish nationalists were acquiring experience through their involvement in local government. While so many of the British youth groups of the period were divided by religious denomination, the Fianna tried to promote unity among\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n11\n\nIrish boys by welcoming members of all creeds. In light of Ireland’s long history of religious division, it is not surprising that the Fianna eschewed the Bible study of the Boys’ Brigade and the non-denominational, nature-loving Christian spirituality of the Baden-Powell movement.57 The Irish youth group emphasised the importance of morality, but rarely made specific reference to religion, though most of its members were Roman Catholic. Not all Irish nationalists could see the value of the Fianna, however. Liam Mellows, who travelled around Ireland in 1913 to organise new Fianna troops, recalled that some of the ‘would-be Nationalists’ that he ‘appealed to for help, spoke of the movement with sarcasm and pointed out how, in their worldly wisdom, it was doomed to failure’. ‘What can a handful of boys do against the great British Empire?’ some shrugged. Others feared that the Fianna would give boys a taste for military life that would inspire them to join the British army. Still others found the youth group’s advanced nationalist principles too extreme.58 Rosamond Jacob, who became honorary president of a short-lived troop of Fianna girls in Waterford, had concerns about the nature of Markievicz’s leadership and its impact on members: ‘Madame is a bloodthirsty woman … and the [Fianna] boys seem the same in theory.’59 As these observations suggest, uniformed youth groups like the Fianna did not just instil order, discipline and specific skills in their members, they could also be training grounds for nationalist fundamentalism. In Germany, the years of the First World War saw the expansion of military youth companies. Andrew Donson has argued that these groups not only ‘reinforced the idea that … aggressiveness and a willingness to sacrifice life for nation were positive traits’ but also helped to mould future Nazis.60 The Fianna proved to be a training ground for Irish republican fundamentalism, with many members participating in the struggle for Irish independence during the period 1913–23. The participation of serving and former members of the Fianna in the events of the Irish Revolution will be discussed in the chapters that follow. Members of other Irish nationalist youth groups also participated in these events. For example, thirteen members of the ICA Scout Corps mobilised during the 1916 Rising, including fifteen-year-old Roddy Connolly. He was the son of James Connolly, one of the rebellion’s leaders.61 Another member of the same age, draper’s assistant Charles Darcy, was killed in action on Easter Monday 1916 when he was shot while serving as a sniper on the roof of the Henry and James clothing\n\n12\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nstore on the corner of Parliament Street across from City Hall and Dublin Castle.62 After the surrender, the surviving ICA scouts were rounded up by the authorities, given a lecture and sent home. This apparently marked the end of the ICA’s junior section. When the ICA reorganised in the summer after the rebellion, about two-thirds of the boys joined the adult organisation. Some, such as Joe Keeley and Robert (also known as Fredrick) Norgrove, went on to play a role in the War of Independence and the Civil War.63 Members of the Clann na Gael Girl Scouts also engaged in nationalist activism before and after the 1916 Rising. At least four members, May Kelly, Cecilia Conroy, Margaret (Maggie) Fagan and Mary McLoughlin, participated in the rebellion. McLoughlin, then aged fifteen, served as a courier, delivering messages and ammunition between garrisons.64 After the Rising, Clann na Gael Girl Scouts are reported to have participated in republican parades and sold lapel flags as part of the anticonscription campaign in 1918. They also carried messages for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), as the Irish Volunteers were later known, during the War of Independence and held vigils at the gates of Mountjoy prison while republican prisoners were on hunger strike in 1920. After the outbreak of the Civil War in 1922, Clann na Gael helped those IRA members who were opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty when their garrison in Dublin’s Four Courts was being shelled by the forces of the pro-Treaty provisional Irish government.65 Clann na Gael members faced arrest and imprisonment as a result of their activities. In the summer of 1916, May Kelly (also known as O’Kelly), Eileen Conroy and Maggie Fagan were arrested for carrying an American flag as part of a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of veteran Fenian Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin Cemetery. They were detained in custody for three to four days before the military authorities ordered their release.66 Research undertaken by Ann Matthews indicates that Clann na Gael members were among the women interned by the Irish Free State government during the Civil War.67 For example, in March 1923, Christina (Chrissie) Behan was arrested for being a member of the Clann na Gael Girl Scouts, which had supported the anti-Treaty side in opposition to the Irish government.68 Behan served 130 days in prison between 16 March and 24 July 1923, during which time she spent eleven days on hunger strike.69 May Kelly was also interned for ninety-five days between 31 March and 4 July 1923.70 As the examples in this chapter show, the Fianna were not the only uniformed youth group in Ireland to instil nationalist fundamentalism\n\nNa Fianna Éireann in context\n\n13\n\nin its members during the revolutionary era. Na Fianna Éireann were, however, the era’s most significant Irish nationalist youth group in terms of size and impact on the Irish struggle for independence. The organisation also generated the largest body of primary sources on which to base a study of its contribution to the Irish Revolution.\n\nNOTES 1 Colonel Joseph V.

Boys interested are invited to attend.2\n\nMichael Lonergan was about fifteen years of age when he attended a meeting ‘held in a dingy hall at the rear of 34 Lower Camden Street’ in Dublin on 16 August 1909.3 It was the first public organisational meeting of a proposed nationalist youth group called Na Fianna Éireann, or the Irish National Boy Scouts. He recalled that ‘there were fifty or sixty boys present, mostly adventurers from the Coombe and the neighbourhood, and I found myself seated beside a lad whom I judged was not from Dublin at all by reason of his accent’. The lad was Con Colbert, who would be executed seven years later as a result of his role in the 1916 Easter Rising. In Lonergan’s retrospective view, this ‘dingy’ theatrical hall should be ‘designated some kind of a national shrine’ because it was there that the events leading to Easter Week began. It was there that military training in preparation for a rebellion started in earnest.4\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF NA FIANNA ÉIREANN Bulmer Hobson founded two nationalist organisations called Na Fianna Éireann. They were named after the Fianna, the band of warriors led by the mythical Irish hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The first was a boys’ hurling and cultural club, which Hobson launched in Belfast in 1902.5 The second, more successful and enduring organisation was established in Dublin in 1909 when Countess Constance Markievicz, a relatively recent convert to Irish nationalism, teamed up with Hobson to establish a nationalist youth group designed to counteract the pro-British Boy Scout movement founded by Robert Baden-Powell in the previous year.\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n21\n\nThe two founders of the Fianna met in Dublin in 1908. Not only were both Markievicz and Hobson the descendants of seventeenthcentury planters on the paternal sides of their families, but they also had English mothers. The daughter of landowner and philanthropist Sir Henry Gore-Booth of Lissadell, County Sligo, and his wife Georgina Mary Hill of Tickhill Castle, Yorkshire, Markievicz was born into a life of Anglo-Irish privilege. Educated at home on her father’s estate, Markievicz gained an appreciation of the arts and enjoyed riding and hunting. Her education was capped by a grand tour of continental Europe and her presentation to Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. As an adult, she supported the cause of women’s suffrage and studied art in London and Paris. While at art school in the latter city, she met her future husband Count Casimir Dunin-Markievicz of a Polish landowning family, whom she married in 1900. A year later they had a daughter, Maeve, who was mainly raised by her Gore-Booth grandparents. The Markieviczes moved to Dublin where they enlivened the cultural scene through their painting and theatrical productions.6 Hobson, in contrast, was the product of a middle-class north Belfast Quaker family. His father, Benjamin Hobson Jr, was a commercial traveller and a Gladstonian home ruler, while his mother Mary Ann Bulmer was a women’s rights activist and amateur archaeologist from Darlington, County Durham. It was through his mother that Hobson met the poets Alice Milligan and Ethna Carbery (the pseudonym of Anna Johnston) who helped to spark his interest in Irish nationalism. Milligan lent the adolescent Standish O’Grady’s retellings of Irish sagas and Carbery encouraged him to join the Gaelic League, an Irishlanguage organisation founded in 1893. While a student at a Quaker boarding school in Lisburn, he subscribed to the Shan Van Vocht, the nationalist paper edited by the two women. After he left the Friends’ School, Hobson became an apprentice printer. In his spare time, he participated in such organisations as the Gaelic League, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). The latter was a secret society dedicated to the foundation of an independent Irish republic through the use of physical force if necessary. An active propagandist from his late teens onwards, Hobson contributed articles and poetry to advanced nationalist newspapers and set up a few new nationalist groups of his own, including the first version of Na Fianna Éireann.7 Hobson founded this boys’ hurling club after the Belfast County Board of the GAA showed no interest in holding competitions for the junior clubs. Hobson had attended the first meeting of the Belfast\n\n22\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nHurling Committee in August 1901, which consisted of two representatives from each of the city’s seven hurling clubs. Representing the hurling club linked to the Gaelic League’s Tír na nÓg (Land of Youth) branch, he became secretary of the new organisation.8 In the following month, the committee decided to affiliate with the GAA as soon as possible and began calling itself the Belfast County Board of the GAA. It later became the first Antrim County Board of the GAA.9 Although there had been hurling clubs in Antrim previously, not enough clubs had existed to form a county committee.10 The committee intended to spare no effort to revive hurling in the North: ‘All that can be done to start hurling clubs in Ulster, will be done, and it will not be long now till the old game will be a potent factor in making Belfast as Irish as in the past it has been English.’11 Hobson, who was eighteen years of age at the time, wanted the board to promote hurling among the youth. Unlike adults who took up hurling, young boys ‘had grace and acquired skill very rapidly’. He thought that if Antrim were ever to have hurling teams that could compete with those in other counties, they ‘should concentrate on training the young boys and making first-class hurlers out of them’.12 Hobson proposed that the county board of the GAA should hold competitions for the junior clubs. The other board members had no interest in this proposal, so Hobson resigned from his position as secretary in September 1901.13 On 22 June 1902, at the beginning of the hurling season, he called a mass meeting in the Catholic Boys’ Hall on the Falls Road, which was attended by nearly 300 boys.14 At this meeting, he proposed the formation of Na Fianna Éireann, suggesting that the organisation would help to revive ‘this old Irish sport’ and teach the boys ‘to speak their own native tongue’, which would enable them to do ‘noble, and exhalted [sic] work for Ireland’.15 In keeping with the organisation’s name, each club was named after one of the warriors in Fionn Mac Cumhaill’s old Fianna, such as Conan Maol or Goll Mac Morna, and the playing field’s name was changed from Klondyke to Cnoc Aluinn, the legendary home of the Fianna.16 By July 1902, twelve hurling clubs belonged to Na Fianna Éireann.17 The tremendous excitement of the Fianna’s inaugural meeting convinced Hobson that the fledgling organisation was something that could be moulded ‘into a strong force to help in the liberation of Ireland’.18 Arthur Griffith’s paper, United Irishman, saw the organisation as an antidote to the Catholic Boys’ Brigades that had turned into recruiting grounds for the British army: ‘Twenty thousand Irish boys\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n23\n\nenrolled in national brigades North and South to-day would mean twenty thousand thinking and disciplined men to-morrow, and twenty thousand thinking, disciplined men, filled with one purpose – what might they not accomplish in a land like ours!’19 The Belfast Fianna developed into a sporting and cultural club. It held inter-club hurling competitions and classes on Irish language and history. Later it expanded to include Gaelic football and theatre. At a meeting of the executive of the Belfast Fianna on 17 October 1902, Hobson announced that ‘he intended to form a dramatic section from the various clubs’ and asked each club representative to provide him with a list of suitable members from each club. A meeting of boys who qualified for the dramatic section was to be held on 4 November 1902.20 A former member of the first Belfast Fianna, Seamus Robinson, recalled an attempt to produce a play by Hobson, but did not know whether this play about United Irishman Theobald Wolfe Tone was ever staged.21 Although this initial version of the Fianna got off to a successful start in Belfast, the organisation later ran into difficulties due to lack of money and Hobson’s increasing commitments to other advanced nationalist activities. Despite the problems of sustainable finance and leadership, Hobson believed ‘it accomplished quite a lot for the national movement in Belfast’.22 The organisation ‘continued to exist for many years with various efforts from time to time to infuse new life into it’.23 On 28 January 1907, two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) apparently deemed the activities of the Fianna suspicious enough to warrant entering its hall at Willowbank through a window in order to interrogate two sixteen-year-old members about the organisation and several Belfast nationalists.24 Remnants of Hobson’s original Fianna were still in existence in 1909 when he joined Markievicz in establishing a new version of the Fianna as a nationalist youth organisation in Dublin.25 Hobson was in his mid-twenties when he served as one of Markievicz’s first mentors in the Sinn Féin movement. The countess, who was in her early forties, had been converted to Irish nationalism after stumbling across a bundle of back issues of the advanced nationalist newspapers The Peasant and Sinn Féin. She initially approached Griffith about getting involved in the movement, but her Anglo-Irish credentials roused his suspicions that she was a British spy. She then met Hobson who was, as she later put it, ‘leader of the opposition’ against Griffith on the Sinn Féin executive. The all-embracing Hobson took her in hand and launched her into the advanced nationalist world.\n\n24\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nHe arranged for her to join the Drumcondra branch of Sinn Féin and introduced her to his friend Helena Molony, who brought her into the fold of the nationalist women’s organisation Inghinidhe na hÉireann (Daughters of Erin). Years later, after their friendship had soured due to political differences, the countess insisted that Hobson only patronised her in order to gain another ally in his power struggle with Griffith.26 After reading an Irish Times account of the Lord Lieutenant Lord Aberdeen’s interest in a number of Boys’ Brigades and Boy Scout troops in the spring of 1909, Markievicz was haunted by the image of these Irish boys, as she put it, ‘saluting the flag that flew in triumph over every defeat their nation has known’.27 This sparked her decision to administer a nationalist antidote.28 Over the next two months, she raised the issue of starting a nationalist boy scout troop at Sinn Féin meetings, but got little response.29 She also approached Griffith directly about gaining support for her plan from Sinn Féin, but was turned down – no doubt due to her vision of a physical force troop and her existing connection with Hobson.30 Ironically, Griffith had been in favour of the formation of a nationalist boys’ brigade organisation when Hobson, who was not yet a threat, had established the first incarnation of the Fianna in 1902.31 Prior to teaming up with Hobson, Markievicz had experienced ongoing difficulties in her own attempts to start a nationalist boy scout troop. Her first step had been to enlist the assistance of a schoolmaster with nationalist sympathies to help her attract boy recruits. A unionist schoolmaster friend recommended William O’Neill who taught at St Andrew’s National School on Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street).32 During a visit to IRB leader Tom Clarke’s shop, the countess mentioned her plan to approach O’Neill about recruiting some boys to start a nationalist boy scout troop. Clarke ‘thought it a good idea but pointed out to her that as she was a non-Catholic O’Neill might look upon her with suspicion. In fact … he might suspect proselytism.’ At Clarke’s suggestion, she asked Sean McGarry, a future president of the IRB Supreme Council, to accompany her. Once they had convinced O’Neill that Markievicz was not ‘an emissary’ from the Lord Lieutenant’s wife Lady Aberdeen,33 he introduced them to eight or nine boys, who helped to form the nucleus of what would later become the new Fianna.34 The countess invited these boys to her home on Frankfort Avenue in the well-heeled south Dublin suburb of Rathgar, and dubbed them ‘The Red Branch Knights’. With the help of Molony, McGarry and another IRB member, Patrick McCartan, she tried – unsuccessfully – to instruct them in signalling, drill and scouting, while they – successfully – raided\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n25\n\nFigure 1 Countess Constance Markievicz.\n\nher husband’s whiskey supply.35 Markievicz later admitted that ‘none of us elders understood boys in the least, and no one knew anything about the subjects we set out to teach’.36 This was certainly the case when Markievicz and Molony blithely took six of the boys on a camping trip to a picturesque ‘little valley away up on the side of Three Rock Mountain’, south of Dublin. After long hours hauling their equipment, provisions and poetry books uphill with the assistance of a pony and cart, they reached their destination where they struggled to pitch their tents in the dark. The next morning the countess awoke to find her towel and soap ‘a brown dripping rag, wrapped round a sticky mess’, the boys having used the\n\n26\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\ncloth to polish their boots. While the boys attended mass, the women settled themselves down to read, but the appearance of a sudden rainstorm sent them scurrying for cover. It had not occurred to them to dig a ditch around their tent, which they had pitched on the side of a hill, so all the blankets and cushions were soon soaked. Thanks to the reappearance of sunshine and the heat of a primus stove, these items were dry by bedtime. The following day saw the end of their outdoor adventure, though the repeated refusal of the pony to be caught and harnessed delayed their departure for home.37 After such a chaotic camping trip, Markievicz decided that the only way for her experiment to work was to organise the boy scout project on a more official footing with the help of Hobson, who, she was told, not only ‘liked and understood boys’ but also had previous experience running a boys’ organisation.38 He pointed out to her that the biggest obstacle to starting a nationalist youth organisation was funding. Money, however, was a mere bagatelle for the countess.39 Thus, in August 1909, she secured Hobson’s assistance and rented a hall at 34 Lower Camden Street in Dublin. At Hobson’s request, the Red Branch Knights became Na Fianna Éireann in homage to his previous Belfast group.40\n\nTHE 1909 INAUGURAL MEETING OF THE FIANNA AND ITS AFTERMATH On Monday, 16 August 1909, Hobson chaired a meeting in the Camden Street hall ‘to form a National Boys’ Organisation to be managed by the boys themselves on national non-party lines’.41 Estimates suggest that between thirty and one hundred boys turned up for this meeting to form what became known as Na Fianna Éireann.42 Markievicz, Molony and a few other adults were also in attendance. In his address, Hobson explained that the organisation would be run on a semi-military basis along the lines of Baden-Powell’s Boy Scout movement. In fact, it was one of the immediate objectives of this new group to counteract the influence in Ireland of that pro-British body.43 Patrick Ward, who attended the meeting with his friend Eamon Martin, reported that Markievicz, Hobson and the young Gaelic Leaguer Pádraic Ó Riain acted as the initial organising committee. He recalled: Madame Markievicz was very intense. She was the first person who captured your notice; then Bulmer Hobson, very quiet and affable and very competent to deal with any question you would like to\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n27\n\nput, was next, apparently, in our mind in importance … There was also Pádraig Ó Riain, a good, efficient secretary.\n\nSoon afterwards, Ward came to reverse his assessment of the relative importance of these three individuals, instead considering Ó Riain ‘as by far the most significant member of that small committee at the time’. Ward regarded Ó Riain’s ‘intellectual and studious development’ as ten years in advance of his age, adding that he possessed ‘a quiet sense of humour and perfect sense of justice’.44 Eamon Martin and Hobson agreed with this assessment of Ó Riain.45 Martin recalled that though Ó Riain appeared to be only sixteen or seventeen (he was actually about eighteen), ‘it was quite obvious that he was well used to meetings and their procedure’ and that he had a ‘capacity for orderly organisation’.46 Hobson also praised Ó Riain, citing him as the ‘dominating personality in the Fianna’ during the period 1909–16. Hard-working and a natural leader, Ó Riain was responsible, in his view, for the success of the Fianna in these critical early years.47 Accounts of this first Fianna meeting provide differing details regarding the election of officers and a provisional committee.48 All accounts agree that Hobson was elected president. Some refer to the election of Markievicz and Ó Riain as joint secretaries, while others suggest that Markievicz became vice-president and Ó Riain secretary. This discrepancy may have arisen because a number of organisational meetings were held at the time.49 Markievicz reported that she served as secretary at the inaugural meeting on 16 August 1909, with Ó Riain replacing her in this role at subsequent meetings.50 The countess’s election – let alone the mere presence of women at the meeting – sparked controversy. Markievicz was taken aback when ‘one of the bigger lads’ – probably fifteen-year-old Robert (Bob) Harding – stood up and called for Molony and herself to be ‘put out’ of the hall.51 Many boys were reluctant to accept a woman in office because they felt there was no place for a female in a physical force association.52 Ironically, she was the best qualified person in the room to teach them how to handle firearms.53 According to Hobson, he often had to point out discreetly that the boys could not take her money and at the same time deny her membership or office. In his view, ‘this feeling against the presence of a woman in the organisation continued in varying degrees of intensity for many years and probably never completely disappeared’.54 An Chéad Sluagh (The First Troop) was born out of this inaugural meeting in August 1909.55 Its members met regularly in the Camden Street\n\n28\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nFigure 2 Bulmer Hobson (seated) and Pádraic Ó Riain.\n\nhall, adopting a dark green jersey and kilt as their uniform.56 With the future expansion of the organisation, other Fianna members chose to wear dark breeches and an olive green tunic with brass buttons.57 A month after its formation, it was reported that officers and a committee had been elected at a general meeting of the sluagh. The officers included B. Hobson (president); Patrick Walsh, C. de Markievicz, J. Robinson and J. Dundon (honorary secretaries); and P. Ó Riain (treasurer of the camping fund), while the committee consisted of S. Mac Caisin, C. Colbert, G. Harvey, R. Harding, G. Sherry, S. McGarry and H. Molony.58\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n29\n\nBy September 1909, a growing number of boys were meeting at the hall every Tuesday and Thursday evening for military drill.59 Con Colbert was the first instructor in elementary drill formations. Eamon Martin reported: ‘[Colbert] was no great expert at this time. By intense swotting, however, he improved as the weeks went on, and, consequently, so did the sluagh.’ Later on, certain members of the sluagh, such as the dapper Michael Lonergan, emerged as natural instructors.60 The troop also received drill instruction from Sean Kavanagh, an ex-member of the British army, to whom Seamus Mac Caisin attributed not only the discipline of the Fianna but also the later Irish Volunteers.61 The activities of the Fianna soon expanded. In October 1909, the newspaper Bean na hÉireann reported that ‘the hall at 34 Lr. Camden St. is open almost every night in the week. On Monday it is drill, on Tuesday games, on Wednesday language and history classes, on the Thursday the leaders of sections drill, and on Friday the room is open for games and drill.’62 Route marches, scouting, camping and a lecture series on inspirational topics such as the ‘boy heroes’ of the 1798 rebellion were also on offer.63 The range of activities available continued to expand so that through their involvement with the Fianna the boys had the opportunity to learn elementary drill, signalling, first aid, route marching and scouting skills such as map reading, path-finding and elementary astronomy. They also studied Irish language and history, particularly that of battles and insurrections. As Eamon Martin explained, ‘in this way the boys were being given a reason for their own military training’.64 The Fianna initially faced ‘opposition, ridicule and indifference’, even from fellow nationalists.65 For instance, a correspondent to Griffith’s Sinn Féin newspaper was keen to dissociate the local branches of Sinn Féin and the Gaelic League from the new boys’ group.66 Alternatively, some Sinn Féin branches, such as the one in Drumcondra with which Markievicz was affiliated, later encouraged the formation of new Fianna sluaighte by allowing the boys to use their meeting rooms.67 Inghinidhe na hÉireann’s paper Bean na hÉireann (Woman of Ireland), which Molony edited, was supportive from the start and provided coverage of early Fianna activities. For example, in September 1909, the paper asserted: ‘Some Nationalists think that the boys don’t count in the nation, but the founders of Na Fianna Éireann rightly consider them of supreme importance. They are the recruits for the future armies of Ireland, and on them the future of Ireland must depend.’68 Inghinidhe na hÉireann had long recognised the value of youth to the\n\n30\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nnationalist movement. Shortly after its inception in 1900, this women’s nationalist organisation established free classes in Irish language, literature, history and music for children over the age of nine, mainly in Dublin and Cork, but ended up abandoning ‘its boys’ classes because they were too hard to manage’.69 The foundation of the Fianna helped to fill this gap. Publications associated with Hobson, such as the IRBbacked newspaper Irish Freedom and the eponymous Irish Volunteer organ, also published regular reports of Fianna activities.70 Around the same time that Markievicz and Hobson started Na Fianna Éireann, the pair also hatched a scheme to establish an agricultural commune. Hobson had come up with the idea of living on a small farm, possibly in an agricultural colony, so that he could spend half his time farming and the other half reading and writing.71 However, he lacked the money to undertake the plan which had been inspired by E. T. Craig’s book A History of Ralahine. This book outlined the fortunes of a short-lived co-operative colony established by County Clare landlord John Scott Vandeleur on his Ralahine estate. Vandeleur had been inspired by a series of lectures given by Robert Owen, the originator of the co-operative movement, in the Rotunda in Dublin in 1823. He invited Owen’s follower Craig to organise the experiment among the tenants on his estate. Hobson saw it as ‘the first … attempt to establish a national social order’ in Ireland.72 The Ralahine project worked for a while but was later scuttled by a combination of Vandeleur’s gambling debts and the fact that there was no legal recognition of the collective ownership of the property.73 Hobson lent Craig’s book to Markievicz. She was not only charmed by the idea of an agricultural commune but also possessed the financial means to put his idea into action. Fired with enthusiasm, Markievicz and Hobson, with their friend Molony in tow, decided to resurrect the commune in what is now the north Dublin suburb of Finglas. Markievicz rented Belcamp Park, ‘a fine, big, roughcastlimestone house about six miles north of Dublin off the Malahide Road’. For a rent of about £100 per year, they got the house, which had about twenty rooms, seven and a half acres of land, stables and a walled garden – all in a state of disrepair.74 They moved into the house at the end of the summer of 1909. The commune mainly consisted of Markievicz, Hobson, Molony and Donnchadh O’Hannigan, a graduate of Glasnevin Agricultural College.75 It was soon inundated by Fianna boys, who came for camping trips and shooting practice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the countess and Molony were stuck cooking and washing up from eight in the morning to eight in the evening\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n31\n\nwhile Hobson commuted to Dublin on a daily basis to deal with his political and journalistic commitments. Only O’Hannigan was free to engage in any market gardening.76 The countess’s biographer Sean O’Faolain offers a vivid account of various reactions to the commune. Apparently, Casimir Markievicz returned to Ireland to discover that his wife was the laughing stock of Dublin.77 Even their friend Sean McGarry had branded the trio of Hobson, Molony and the countess ‘idiots’ for starting the commune.78 Not surprisingly, the project gave rise to a medley of rumours. Some gossips claimed that Count Markievicz was threatening to fight a duel with Hobson while others discussed the alleged fears of Denis McCullough, Hobson’s Belfast partner in nationalism, that this married lady would destroy the young man’s political career in the same way that Charles Stewart Parnell’s relationship with Katharine O’Shea had destroyed his.79 Less whimsical rumours linked Hobson and Molony romantically.80 In a bid to end the commune through harassment, the count gleefully fed the rumour mill by spreading unscrupulous stories about his wife, Hobson and Molony. When this tactic did not work, he turned dinners at Belcamp Park into board meetings at which he bombarded the would-be ‘communists’ with economic figures that deflated their enthusiasm for the scheme. O’Faolain estimated that the experiment, which lasted about two months (probably September and October 1909), accumulated a net loss of £250. The countess and Molony remained at the house until they could get out of the five-year lease.81 Molony recalled the episode in a more positive light than O’Faolain: ‘Financially it was not a success, but the Fianna enjoyed it thoroughly and put a lot of work into developing the grounds. When we decided to wind up the experiment we succeeded in getting a buyer, and the losses which we shared were not very great.’82 Meanwhile, unemployment forced Hobson back home to Belfast in early November 1909, leaving behind rumours that a romance between himself and Molony had failed along with the commune.83 In Hobson’s absence, the countess was elected president of the Fianna, a position that she retained even after Hobson moved back to Dublin in 1911. Upon his return, he resumed his active involvement with the Fianna nationally, serving as vice-president until the Fianna’s reorganisation in mid-1915 and a member of the ard-choisde (central council) until the 1916 Easter Rising.84 Hobson’s opposition to the Rising effectively ended his involvement with the Fianna, but the countess maintained her connection to the organisation until her death in 1927.\n\n32\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nA former Fianna member, Fr Thomas O’Donoghue, once described Hobson as the ‘head’ of the nationalist youth group and Markievicz the ‘heart’.85 To make his dream of creating ‘a strong force to help in the liberation of Ireland’ come true, Hobson needed Markievicz’s energy, enthusiasm, initial injection of money and, due to her gender and social position, ability to inspire the trust and confidence of the parents of the younger boys.86 Without her impetus, he probably would not have attempted to resurrect the Fianna. To make her dream come true, she needed his organisational experience, the template of his previous boys’ group, and though she may not have been aware of it, his connection to the IRB. Although the united front of the countess and the Quaker later disintegrated due to political differences, their brainchild survived.\n\nNOTES 1 An earlier draft of this chapter and the one that follows were published as Marnie Hay, ‘The foundation and development of Na Fianna Éireann, 1909–16’, Irish Historical Studies, 36:141 (May 2008), pp. 53–71. 2 ‘A Boys’ Brigade’, SF, 14 Aug. 1909, p. 4. 3 The building that housed the first Fianna hall was demolished in 2012. 4 Michael Lonergan, witness statement, 1 Aug. 1948 (MA, BMH, WS 140). 5 Marnie Hay, Bulmer Hobson and the Nationalist Movement in TwentiethCentury Ireland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009), pp. 28–9. 6 Senia Pašeta, ‘Markievicz, Constance Georgine’ in James McGuire and James Quinn (eds), Dictionary of Irish Biography (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), available from http://dib.cambridge.org. 7 For more detail on Hobson’s nationalist career, see Hay, Bulmer Hobson and the Nationalist Movement in Twentieth-Century Ireland. 8 UI, 17 Aug. 1901, p. 5; UI, 24 Aug. 1901, p. 5. 9 UI, 14 Sept. 1901, p. 5. 10 Marcus de Búrca, The GAA: A History (Dublin: Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, 1980), p. 58. 11 UI, 28 Sept. 1901, p. 5. 12 Bulmer Hobson, Ireland Yesterday and Tomorrow (Tralee: Anvil Books, 1968), p. 15. 13 Irish News, 18 Sept. 1901, p. 8. 14 Na Fianna Éireann minute book, 1902 (NLI, Bulmer Hobson Papers, MS 12,176). 15 Ibid.\n\nThe countess and the Quaker\n\n33\n\n16 Bulmer Hobson, ‘The IRB and the Fianna’ in F.

There are those who think the organisation of little importance because it is made up of boys, but such people forget that though one may be too young to be the possessor of that powerful weapon called a vote, nobody is too young to serve his country, and, if necessary, fight for his country.1\n\nIn 1913, Liam Mellows, the newly appointed Fianna organiser, took to the open road on his bicycle to accelerate the expansion of the nationalist youth group around the country. In a published report, he described slogging through wet weather and muddy roads in counties Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Tipperary in order to liaise with local contacts and hold meetings to form new sluaighte (troops). Very few people appeared to realise ‘what an asset to Ireland the boys were’. According to Mellows, some of the ‘would-be Nationalists’ that he ‘appealed to for help, spoke of the movement with sarcasm and pointed out how, in their worldly wisdom, it was doomed to failure. “What can a handful of boys do against the great British Empire?”’ they shrugged. Others worried that the military training provided by the Fianna would inspire boys to join the British army. Still others found the youth group too extremist in its commitment to Irish nationalism.2 Despite being faced with such negative attitudes, Na Fianna Éireann soldiered on, preparing boys (and some girls) for their future roles in the struggle for Irish independence. Between its establishment in 1909 and the end of the Irish Civil War in 1923, the youth organisation developed in terms of structure, purpose, policies, membership figures and geographical spread. Changes in the organisation’s development were often linked to political events and trends within the wider nationalist\n\n38\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nmovement. This chapter will take a chronological look at the Fianna’s organisational development up to the 1916 Easter Rising, with the following chapter covering the period 1916–23.\n\nBRANCHING OUT Na Fianna Éireann soon grew beyond An Chéad Sluagh. On 29 September 1909, Hobson presided over a meeting held in the rooms of the Drumcondra Branch of Sinn Féin on St Joseph’s Avenue to form a second branch of the Fianna that would cater to boys on the north side of Dublin.3 A third branch of the Fianna was then established by Micheál O’Neill in Waterford c. October 1909, though it is unclear how long it initially survived.4 In the pages of Bean na hÉireann, the adult nationalist organisations were exhorted to do their duty so that no town within Ireland would be without a branch of the Fianna.5 In the northeast of Ireland, the Fianna first spread to Belfast. Although plans for the formation of a Belfast branch were underway in December 1909, it appears that the sluagh was not officially established until a meeting held in the Dungannon Club on 7 March 1910.6 Joseph Robinson, a member of Hobson’s original Belfast Fianna, and William Woods recruited Belfast boys through the Peter O’Neill Gaelic Football Club and the O’Neill’s Pipe Band. One of those boys was David McGuinness who recalled that seventy boys had joined within three months. The Belfast Fianna initially met in the band’s room above a tobacconist’s shop on Mill Street, but as numbers grew they moved their premises to the huts at Willowbank which had been used by a British cavalry unit.7 Growth of the organisation continued in 1910. Under the auspices of the North Dock branch of Sinn Féin, a new Fianna sluagh was formed at 10 Beresford Place in Dublin early in the year.8 In the summer of 1910, Bean na hÉireann reported the creation of four new sluaighte, three in Dublin and one in Glasgow. The new Dublin sluaighte were based in John Street (May 1910), James’s Street (June 1910) and Sandwith Street (July 1910). Joseph Robinson, who was also involved with the Belfast Fianna, was the president of the Glasgow branch, which was formed in April 1910 and soon attracted about fifty members.9 As a result of the growing number of sluaighte, the Fianna leadership recognised that the youth organisation required clear rules and a formal structure. As early as the autumn of 1909, a joint committee of the section leaders of the Dublin Fianna was formed to meet on\n\nA handful of boys against the British Empire, 1909–16\n\n39\n\na monthly basis to revise the rules in order to make them uniform throughout the city.10 The structure of the organisation was further solidified by the first annual Fianna conference, which was held in the Mansion House in Dublin on 21 August 1910. At this event, a national executive was elected that included: Countess Markievicz (president), Councillor Paul Gregan and Bulmer Hobson (vice-presidents), Pádraic Ó Riain (honorary secretary), Michael Lonergan (honorary assistant secretary) and James Gregan (treasurer).11 In addition to its executive, the Fianna consisted of an ard-fheis (congress), an ard-choisde (central council), district councils and sluaighte. The ard-fheis, which met annually, was the ‘supreme governing and legislative body of the Fianna’. It comprised the ard-choisde and delegates from the various sluaighte and district councils, which were formed in 1911 in Dublin and Belfast, where there were three or more sluaighte. The ard-choisde was responsible for the general direction of Na Fianna Éireann and served as the governing body of the organisation when the ard-fheis was not sitting.12 At the Fianna’s first ard-fheis, Ó Riain reported that seven sluaighte were officially affiliated to the national organisation, five in Dublin, one in Waterford and one in Glasgow, with each sluagh consisting of twenty to sixty members.13 It is unclear whether the Belfast sluagh and one of the Dublin branches previously mentioned had ceased to exist or they were not officially affiliated to the national organisation. In any case, October 1910 saw the inauguration of a sluagh in Belfast with plans for the formation of another one there. Elsewhere in the country, a Fianna branch had been established in Clonmel, County Tipperary, while plans were underway to form a troop in Cork.14 In November 1910, a branch of the Fianna was started at St Enda’s School for boys, which Patrick Pearse had founded in 1908 in order to combine a more progressive, child-centred way of teaching with a curriculum that was truly Irish. He not only fostered bilingualism in Irish and English at the school but also ensured that Gaelic games, musical evenings and the production of Irish plays and pageants were an important part of school life. On 24 November 1910, the day after Con Colbert had given the students their ‘first lesson in military foot drill’, Pearse announced his plan to form ‘a body of the Fianna in the School, with the object of encouraging moral, mental, and physical “fitness”’. The new branch was ‘duly organised’ on 28 November with members being ‘divided into eight buidheanta or companies’, each under the leadership of a Taoiseach or Captain. The companies were then ‘grouped into two catha or battalions’ under\n\n40\n\nNa Fianna Éireann and the Irish Revolution, 1909–23\n\nthe leadership of a Mor-Thaoiseach or Colonel. Pearse served as the branch’s commander-in-chief or Ard-Taoiseach’. The branch’s activities included ‘drill, gymnastics, shooting, fencing, boxing, wrestling, swimming, ambulance work, mountain marches, camping out, and scouting’.15 In January 1911, it was reported that the Fianna were ‘making splendid headway in Belfast’ with close to 150 boys enrolled in the city’s first sluagh, entitled Clann Rudhraighe. Not only was a second Belfast troop called Sluagh Willie Nelson ‘doing well’, but plans were afoot to form a third sluagh in the northern city.16 Within two months Eithne Ní Baoghaoil (Annie O’Boyle) had organised a girls’ troop in Belfast that consisted of ‘25 most enthusiastic young girls all striving to follow in the footsteps of the Irish women of the past’.17 O’Boyle was one of the women associated with the Belfast Dungannon Club, which had been co-founded by Hobson and had a women’s division called Cumann na Cailíní.18 Although Irish Freedom initially reported that the girls’ sluagh was named in honour of the late Belfast poet Ethna Carbery (the pseudonym of Anna Johnston McManus), it actually became known as the Betsy Gray sluagh, honouring a heroine of the 1798 rebellion.19 The girls’ troop had its own version of the Fianna uniform: the girls wore ‘green linen shirts’ while the boys’ shirts were made of ‘hopsack’.20 The establishment of this girls’ troop may have been a nationalist reaction to the formation in Belfast in 1910 of what was one of the few pre-war Girl Guide companies in Ireland.21 Alternatively, O’Boyle may have wanted to extend the Fianna’s activities to nationalist girls."
