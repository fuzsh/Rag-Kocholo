It was created from official papers (OP 1837/133) held by the National Archives of Ireland in Dublin. A memorial was a petition. The memorial captured in this publication was created by those who wanted to change the location of the Quarter Session from Baltinglass to Tinahely. All the names and addresses have been transcribed and they are ordered, first, alphabetically by surname, and second, alphabetically by place name. There are nearly 1,500 names represented. The original document was handwritten, therefore some errors in transcription may have occurred.\n\nThe People of Wicklow 1798: The Rebellion - The publication was researched and compiled by Pat Power. The publication lists members of United Irishmen, Yeomen, and other notable groups of those who took part in the 1798 Rebellion from County Wicklow. It is an excellent source for genealogists and historians. The lists are in alphabetical order by surname and includes a category for each person which is explained in the introduction (images 6-10).
