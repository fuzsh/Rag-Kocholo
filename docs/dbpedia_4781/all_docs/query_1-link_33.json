        "text": "The Complete Photographs of Darwin\n\nAudio version of this introduction - YouTube\n\nby John van Wyhe\n\n(This is an extract from the iconography of Darwin in Darwin: A Companion (2021) with many additions, corrections and 520 illustrations. The rest of the iconography or catalogue of over 1,000 unique Darwin portraits including 210 oil paintings, watercolours, drawings, more than 600 printed portraits as well as caricatures and over 240 three-dimensional works such as statues, busts and medallions and iconographies of HMS Beagle, Down House and Emma Darwin is in the book.) Downloadable PDF file of this page.\n\nThis is by far the most complete and accurate catalogue of photographs of Darwin ever published. It includes a dozen discovered during the many years of research for this study. The list includes more details about each photograph than previously published, such as dates, prices, the photographers and comments by Darwin or others on how the photographs were originally received. And, unprecedentedly, it includes details of all known variants produced to the early 20th centuryâmore than 340. This is how Darwin's appearance became so well known to the public during the 19th century and after.\n\nIt is well known that Darwin declined a request to be photographed with A.R. Wallace to illustrate a German translation of the 1858 Linnean papers (F365). (A.B. Meyer to Darwin 24 Nov. 1869 CCD17:497.) Darwin replied that Meyer was welcome to include a photograph \"But I am not willing to sit on purpose; it is what I hate doing & wastes a whole day owing to my weak health; and to sit with another person would cause still more trouble & delayâ¦PS I am very sorry to be disobliging about the Photographs, but I cannot endure the thought of sitting again, and I have refused 3 or 4 Photographers lately.\" (27 Nov. [1869] CCD17:505) Wallace agreed, as he wrote to Darwin on 4 Dec. \"It is of course out of the question our meeting to be photographed together, as Mr. Meyer coolly proposes.\" (CCD17:514) Francis Darwin recalled: \"He certainly had a great regard for time, & speaks in some of his letters with disgust of losing a day. I think one about being photographed.\" (CUL-DAR140.3.1--159)\n\nDespite Darwin's oft-expressed aversion to sitting for photographs, this catalogue reveals that from 1865 he would be photographed every year or alternate year for the remainder of his life except for perhaps 1875-77. It was common practice at the time to sit for a more up-to-date photograph to send to friends and correspondents. In comparison, Emma Darwin was photographed much less. A list of all known photographs and portraits of her are listed in a separate iconography in Darwin: A Companion, 2021.\n\nMost of the photographs of Darwin were eventually commercially available and also reproduced as engravings or woodcuts. Francis Darwin recalled: \"He did not realise that people would know him from his photograph, and I remember him at the Crystal Palace aquarium saying in uneasy voice that somebody had been looking at him & he supposed he must have been recognised.\" (CUL-DAR140.3.1--159)\n\nDating Victorian photographs is particularly difficult as they were almost never dated at the time. They were often reproduced for many years by the same photographic company (and also pirated by others) but differently cropped and edited. Attention to tiny clues can help narrow the possible date ranges. The many variants in the Darwin photographs represent separate orders by photographers to keep copies in stock for sale. Hundreds of thousands of photographs were produced in the 19th century and even more in the first two decades of the 20th century. One popular card alone of topical interest sold over 250,000 copies.\n\nBy mid-century new technologies made large-scale reproduction of photographs possible for the first time in the form of small cartes de visite, 11.4 x 6.3cm (4 Â½ x 2 Â½ inches), the size of a formal visiting card. Paper manufacturers produced card blanks in mass numbers and these were sold to retailers. Professional photographers or photograph publishers would order blank card stock and, as the century progressed, have these printed with their name or address and increasingly ornate designs and advertisements. One could pay for one's own portrait to be made and photographers also sold portraits of famous persons. Albums began to be produced to store collections of these small portrait cards.\n\nAn album for cartes de visite believed to have been compiled by Emma Darwin. (Reeman Dansie Auctioneers, 2022)\n\nFrom the early 1870s a larger format called a cabinet card (10.8 x 16.5cm; 4Â¼ x 6Â½ inches) replaced the earlier carte de visite.\n\nMany traditionally accepted dates for Darwin photographs derive from much later annotations on some copies. Some of these are clearly very inaccurate. Also, for decades Darwin's dress was invariably very similar with a double-breasted waistcoat (often with a similar spotted design), silk cravat and heavy, loose, dark jacket of plain weave. Of the photographs that reveal this, only Claudet 1842, Wallich 1871 and Rejlander 1871a-b show him wearing a single-breasted waistcoat. The latter two are so similar that they might even be the same suit.\n\nHis personal appearance was also very consistent after the 1860s with a mostly bald head and full, bushy white beard. A 30 May 1935 letter from his son Leonard Darwin in the Robert M. Stecher Collection at Case Western Reserve University accompanying an autographed copy of Rejlander 1871d.1 states: \"I think [the photo] was taken somewhere about 1870; but this is a mere guess. He always looked old for his age. It might be rather later.\" Louisa A'hmuty Nash, a neighbour (1873-9) and friend of the Darwins at Down, recalled: \"Those eyebrows used to trouble his wife when his photograph was taken: she used to say the photographers gave him no eyes at all.\" (A223) Some of the dates adopted here might be further revised in future. And there are probably further exposures from sittings already known.\n\nDetails are given below for each photograph and the various printings or variants that were produced, or rather those that have been seen so far. We have no idea how large the print runs were. Nevertheless, this reveals much about the extent to which Darwin's image was circulated, in what forms, and which photographs were most popular in different periods. Such details will also be of interest to collectors. A careful reading of the list will make it clear that many errors about dates and photographers have gone unnoticed for many years in the literature on Darwin and some may still remain in the present list.\n\nOf all those whose records have been found, Julia Margaret Cameron was the most active in registering photographs of Darwin for copyright. There was a rush by some photographers to register their photographs of Darwin for copyright shortly after his death. The first time (so far as seen) each photograph was engraved is noted to illustrate when a particular likeness became widely reproduced and available in print. Gene Kritsky has for many years been collecting and studying photographs of Darwin. He has discovered many photographs and likely some not recorded here. His findings are to be much anticipated. See also Janet Browne, \"I could have retched all night\": Charles Darwin and his body. In Lawrence & Shapin eds., Science incarnate (1998); Browne, Looking at Darwin: portraits and the making of an icon. Isis (Sept. 2009), and Phillip Prodger, Darwin's camera: Art and photography in the theory of evolution, 2009.\n\nÂ Â Â Â A note on signed Darwin photographs: Darwin and his family distributed hundreds and perhaps thousands of photographs of Darwin during and after his lifetime. Darwin signed very many of these as was common practice at the time. However, as is explained below, commercial Victorian CDVs and cabinet cards were routinely printed with a facsimile (lithographed) signature of a famous sitter. The high quality of these facsimiles have fooled many. One recent writer has opined: \"There are signed cabinet cards in the market, but just about all of them are forgeries. A genuine signed photograph is a rarity. There are many Elliot & Fry cabinet cards in the market with a forgery placed at the bottom of the card. There are also many of these same cards that feature a facsimile signature. â¦ caution is warranted. The sad fact is if you see a Darwin signature in the market it is very likely a forgery.\" (R. Keurajian, Collecting historical autographs, 2016, p. 253.) Very many Victorian photographs have had the name of the sitter written on them by a previous owner. These were not meant to be forgeries, just to identify the sitter.\n\nRN51\n\nClaudet 1842.\n\n1842 Aug. 23 Seated half-length three-quarter right profile daguerreotype with first child William Erasmus on his lap by Antoine-FranÃ§ois-Jean Claudet (1797-1867), 18 King William Street, Strand and Coliseum, called The Royal Adelaide Gallery. Only known daguerreotype of Darwin and the only 'photographic' image of him with another person. See Keynes, Annie's box, 2001, pp. 59ff. A London studio portrait with painted drop background. These were advertised as \"EXCLUSIVELY HIS OWN [Claudet's], representing Landscapes, Interior of apartments, &c. which produces the most PICTURESQUE EFFECT\". Darwin chose a landscape with neoclassical motifs. Modern writers have claimed that the sitting took so long that Darwin appeared in it perhaps only to hold William steady. But Claudet's advertisements boasted that \"the sitting generally occupies less than one second, by which faithful and pleasing likenesses are obtained.\" The Bradford Observer (21 Apr. 1842) noted that this rapidity of the exposure method of Claudet \"obviated in a great degree\" the \"objections made to their [i.e. photograph's] stern and gloomy expression\". Thus some Victorians themselves were displeased with what has become the modern stereotype of Victorian photographic portraits because other technologies required long exposure times. According to Evelleen Richards, Darwin and the making of sexual selection, 2017, \"William is wearing a dress, as was conventional for Victorian boys who were not 'breeched' until around five years of age\". The original, 9.4x8.3cm, is at Down House (EH88202861) mounted in a leatherette velvet lined case. Label on glass inscribed \"Aug 23 1842 Ch and William 3 Â¾\". William (b. 27. Dec. 1839) was actually 2 years and 8 months old, close to 2Â¾. Paper label on rear of box \"WED\", William Erasmus Darwin, who lent it for display at Christ's College in 1909. Claudet made a daguerreotype copy of the 1853 drawing of Darwin by Laurence, 11.5x9.2cm. Annotated on rear of case \"Nov 1853\". Down House EH88202863.\n\nClaudet daguerreotype c.1842 of unknown man seated in the same chair and with the same backdrop as Darwin.\n\nThe daguerreotype of Darwin was first photographed at an unknown date. There is a copy in the Darwin family photograph album on display in the sitting room at Down House. It was published by Karl Pearson in The life, letters, and labours of Francis Galton, vol. 3, in 1930. Several versions were apparently produced by Nora Barlow c.1958. See CUL-DAR225.129, and UCL-GaltonPapers1.1.3.7. Barlow published it in Darwin's unexpurgated Autobiography, facing p. 110.\n\nÂ\n\nMaull & Polyblank 1855.1.\n\nMaull & Polyblank 1855.1. Detail from the copy at Christ's College, Cambridge. See: Introduction to this photograph.\n\n1855 Seated half-length, full face in embroidered waistcoat, by Maull & Polyblank for the Literary and Scientific Portrait Club. The Club was \"instituted for the purpose of attaining a uniform set of portraits of the literary and scientific men of the present age at a moderate cost.\" (Contemporary advert.) The Club was joined by paying a fee of 10s 6d to the secretary, J.S. Bowerbank, and being photographed in the studio of Henry Maull (1829-1914) and George Henry Polyblank (b.1831), 187a Piccadilly, London. By joining the club one would receive one print and could purchase a photograph of any other member for 3s. Copies were available to members only. Francis Darwin first saw the photograph in 1909 and suggested it might date to 1854. Darwin paid Maull & Polyblank Â£3 1s. 6d. on 31 Dec. 1855. Classed account book, Down House. This suggests that Darwin purchased c.14 additional prints, though not necessarily all of himself. The portraits in the series are rather uniform. Some depict other men in the exact same pose as Darwin, almost none of them use props such as a microscope or fossil. The series of portraits was issued without text from 1855-c.1858.\n\nAnother sitter in the series in almost identical pose.\n\nThe Linnean Society has a set of 95, but there were many more. Darwin to Hooker 27 May 1855: \"if I really have as bad an expression, as my photograph gives me, how I can have one single friend is surprising.\" CCD5:339. And to Hooker in 1860: \"It makes me look atrociously wicked.\" CCD8:532. Asa Gray to Darwin 1856 Aug. 20 \"[Francis] Boott lately sent me your photograph, which (tho. not a very perfect one) I am well pleased to have.\" CCD6:195. Boott was also a member of the Club.

Litchfield album, Reeman Dansie Auctioneers 2022.\n\nW.E. Darwin 1864a.2. verso detail.\n\na.2. CDV with more of chest and shoulders visible, not in an oval but faded edges. Produced by S.J. Wiseman, Southampton, where William lived. Wiseman (1831-1914) started photography in 1863. By 1871 his business was at 15 Above Bar Street. William may also have taken the photographs of Henrietta and George Darwin that were produced by Wiseman dated by the editors of the CCD as c.1862. Lithographed by Brooks, Quart. Jrnl. of Sci. (1866), facing p. 151. Frontispiece to CCD12. See CCD24:464.\n\nPrinted on verso: maker's monogram and \"S.J.WISEMAN / 9,Bernard Street / SOUTHAMPTON\". The copy in CUL-DAR225.112 has written on the verso \"Photod by W.E.D.\" and on recto mount \"1866 / 1864?\" The latter date has been added since microfilming in the 1960s. A copy in Robert M.

Darwin 1864b.\n\n(From a copy in a private collection)\n\nb. Seated full-figure, three-quarter right profile, draped in cloak with blanket over knees and legs. From a collodion positive, on a small glass plate (7x5.8cm), with black varnish on the back. The original is in CUL-DAR257.3. There is a small patch of red sealing wax on the verso on lower right corner. First published in Browne, Power of place, 2002, facing p. 441, with the caption \"one of the last portraits of\" Darwin. The CUL catalogue suggests 1870s. However, the collodian process was superseded by tintypes during the 1860s. Darwin's hair and unusually short beard in this photograph appear identical with the preceding and following photographs by W.E. Darwin. By permission of the Syndics of Cambridge University Library. It probably remained unprinted/reproduced because it was of poor quality.\n\nW.E. Darwin 1864c. Detail. (H.E. Litchfield album)\n\nc. Half-length three-quarter left profile.

See CCD13:37. Photographs from this sitting are sometimes incorrectly stated to have been taken by the London Stereoscopic Company, which only produced later prints. An 1867 photograph by Edwards of Alexander Tweedie, in the same studio chair, shows the legs and floor. Just visible behind the chair is the heavy metal base of a stand that held the head of the sitter steady during the long exposure.\n\nNote the heavy base of the stand on the floor behind Tweedie who is sitting in the same studio chair.\n\na.

Three-quarter left profile almost indistinguishable from a cropped version of a. but in this one, part of Darwin's shirt and collar are visible as is his right shoulder. Only copy seen is under a mount so further details may be obscured. NHM.\n\nL. Darwin c.1866.\n\nc.1866 Darwin on his cob Tommy in front of Down House, by Leonard Darwin. Sometimes dated to 1866 (when Tommy was acquired) or 1867 and very often to 1868, based on the annotation on the verso of the copy in CUL. No contemporary evidence has been seen for any of these dates. However Darwin looks much more like his 1866 photographs here. Darwin was still riding Tommy in 1870. Exhibited at Christ's College in 1909, lent by W.E. Darwin. Not published during 19th century.\n\n1. Albumen photograph, on display at Down House (EH88202292) is framed with a note by Darwin in ink: \"Hurrah â no letters to day / C.

Least cropped copy/variant.\n\nAnon c.1866-71.1.\n\nc.1866-71 Half-length left profile by unknown photographer. Unusual light-coloured waistcoat. Apparently unknown and never reproduced in any work on Darwin.\n\n1. CDV no text on recto, verso publisher's emblem \"ALLEN. / No. 6 TEMPLE PLACE, BOSTON.\" (USA) Edward L. Allen (1830-1914) had an establishment at this address only from 1866-71 (The Boston directory (1866) and The Boston almanac and business directory (1867-71)). This does not indicate when the photograph was taken, but does establish an end date. Another CDV by Allen with the identical printed emblem on the verso is annotated in pencil \"October 28th 1869\". It is unknown how Allen acquired a negative or photograph of Darwin not seen elsewhere. It could have been taken by Rejlander who took photographs of Darwin in 1871 and who favoured profiles, however Rejlander's photographs always show the background. No other photographs sold by Allen of foreign notables have been found. He did reproduce drawings by the artist S.W. Rowse such as one of Ralph Waldo Emerson, as well as a CDV of him.\n\nAnon c.1866-71.2. (H.E. Litchfield album)\n\n2. CDV with no printing on recto or verso. A copy in the H.E. Litchfield album sold at Reeman Dansie Auctioneers in 2022, from the estate of George Erasmus Darwin (1927-2017), written on verso: \"No 16\" and in blue crayon like others in the album: \"HE Litchfield / 4 Bryanston / Street W.\" and in pencil \"31 Kensington Sq W\". The Litchfields lived at 2 Bryanston Street from 1872 which was renumbered by February 1878 to 4 Bryanston Street and purchased 31 Kensington Square in mid-1882.\n\nEdwards 1866a. Â Â Â Â Â Edwards 1866b.Â Â Â Â Â Edwards 1866c. Â Â Â Â Â Edwards 1866d.\n\n1866 Apr. 24 Four photographs by Ernest Edwards. Taken in London. Darwin paid Edwards Â£3 8s. 6d. on 5 Sept. 1866. Classed account book, Down House. Janet Browne, Power of place, 2002, p. 363, noted that during 1866 Darwin \"paid out a total of Â£14 in small sums for photographs, nearly doubling his overall costs for 'Science' that year\".\n\nÂ It has been claimed that stereograph photographs of Darwin were produced and that one of these is such a photograph. (Scientific American, vol. 253, no. 2, Aug. 1985, p. 66; Browne, Looking at Darwin: Portraits and the Making of an Icon. Isis, 100, no. 3 (2009), pp. 542-570.) This would mean that two photographs were taken simultaneously from slightly different angles. When such dual photographs are viewed through a stereoscope, they produce a three-dimensional effect. However, no actual stereoscopic photographs of Darwin, which are two images on the same card, have ever been found. Instead, standard CDVs by Edwards were sold by the London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company (1854-1922), as printed on the recto of the CDVs, which have been mistaken for stereoscopic photographs. However, the Company produced and sold standard photographs routinely, only some of their sales being of actual stereoscopic views. Famous persons with their names printed on the card were very common. They produced cartes de visite of Darwin until c.1881.\n\nA stereograph photograph of the Exhibition of 1862 by the London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company.\n\nA CDV of another person by London Stereoscopic with printed text on recto mount \"STEREOSCOPIC COY.

Some prints of 1868a carried the lithographed line in Darwin's handwriting \"I like this photograph much better than any other which has been taken of me. / Ch. Darwin\" on the recto mount. This is often mistaken for a handwritten inscription. LL3:92. Purportedly (Cox, p. 317) a copy in a private collection in the UK is actually inscribed thus by Darwin. Darwin's opinion of this photograph as his favourite is very often quoted. Few writers today are aware of the fact that Darwin also declared photographs by Edwards, Elliott & Fry, Rejlander and L. Darwin 1878a as the best photographs of himself. Darwin very free with his superlatives. Multiple signatures of Darwin were lithographed onto different photographs and variants by Cameron. Prints of 1868a are very variable. Some have a lithographed line by Cameron, in others the text is hand written by her. Glass negatives (Cameron's own?) are at Down House, EH88202894 and EH88202895; as well as two framed prints (not identified in the catalogue): frame size 49x38.5cm EH88204450 and frame size 55x47.5cm EH88204436 (verso, annotation in pencil \"presented by Mr. & Mrs. Nicholls, Downe\".).

Joseph John Elliott (1835-1903) and Clarence Edmund Fry (1840-97) established a studio at 55 Baker Street, London, in 1863 and remained in business long after the death of Darwin. From Feb. 1881 they sometimes added 56 Baker Street to their address in newspaper adverts. Bottom edge of pince-nez just visible under jacket in both a. and b. Darwin recorded payments to Elliott & Fry on 25 Jul. 1869 and 5 Apr. 1870. Account books-banking account, Down House. Darwin to A.B. Meyer 27 Nov. [1869]: \"Messrs Elliot & Fry are the last who have taken me, & they came down here on purpose\". CCD17:506 and CCD19:334. By far the rarest of Elliott & Fry Darwin photographs.\n\na.

Copy in CUL-DAR225.117 has \"HE Litchfield abt 1870 1869\" on verso.\n\nA CDV with the same text after Darwin's name and dates and identical verso of the Duke of Argyll is signed and dated by him \"April 1882\". Which suggests that the other Elliott & Fry cards with their name and address in this format are also around 1882.\n\nÂ Â Â Rejlander 1871a.Â Â Â Â Â Rejlander 1871b.\n\n1871a-b Two photographs by Swedish-born photographer Oscar Gustav Rejlander (1813-75). Since 1869 his studio was at 1 Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London, on the first and second storey. These two photographs have almost never been reproduced. Darwin to Elliott & Fry 23 Apr. [1871] \"I lately was several times with Mr Rejlander, who was assisting me on a scientific subject, &, who took so much trouble for my sake that I gladly complied with his request to take several photos: of me, and these I imagine he intends to sell to any purchasers\". CCD19:334. This suggests that both sittings took place during Darwin's stay in London and visits to Rejlander from 1-5 Apr. 1871. Darwin recorded the following payments to Rejlander in his Classed account books (Down House MS): Â£5 5s on 2 May 1871; Â£7 7s on 30 Oct. 1871 under the heading \"Gifts and annual subscriptions\"; Â£7 7s on 14 Mar. 1872 for \"Photos\"; and Â£1 1s on 22 Aug. 1872. There must have been another payment in c. Aug. 1871 of Â£1 1s, and this was clearly for CDVs of Darwin. See Rejlander to Darwin 11 Nov. 1871 thanking Darwin for \"the cheque\" and \"I have sent a bundle of cards for the Â£1.1 and thank you\". CCD19:680. Some of these payments include photographs provided by Rejlander for Darwin's work on Expression, which included photographs from and even of Rejlander. CUL-DAR53.1 & CUL-DAR225. In 1874 Darwin paid him another Â£2 for photographs. Rejlander also photographed W.E. Darwin and R.B. Litchfield. Darwin Archive CUL.\n\na.

Darwin 1878b.\n\n1878b Full-length left profile, seated in a basket chair on the verandah at Down House by Leonard Darwin. Engraved in Century Mag. in 1883. In LL2 (1887), Francis Darwin dated this as \"1874?\". A copy in CUL-DAR140.1 has written on the verso \"?1874\" and a framed copy at Down House is also dated on a label as 1874. These are not three independent datings, but are all Francis Darwin's estimate. Leonard Darwin's 1909 estimate was \"between 1872 and 1878\". Harmer & Ridewood eds., Memorials of Charles Darwin, 1910, p. 20. (In Darwin Online at A313) Although Leonard presumably must have visited at some point, there are no records in Emma Darwin's diary (text) or the correspondence of Leonard visiting Down House during 1874 and in June he departed for New Zealand for the remainder of the year. Whereas there are seven visits recorded in Emma Darwin's diary in 1878 when he certainly did photograph Darwin. For this and other reasons, 1878 seems more likely than 1874.\n\nThe Down House verandah tiles in 2019. The area where Darwin was photographed (in front of the now moved drainpipe) appears to have cleaned or replacement tiles.\n\nA CDV version of the photograph was later sent by W.E. Darwin to Dr. Charles Heaton dated only 9 March: \"The one by Robinson was taken at home by my brother & we consider it the most natural & life like of any of the photographs of him.\" Robert M. Stecher Collection, Case Western Reserve University. Francis Darwin recalled: \"The verandah which was built onto the drawing room was his idea, and gave him much pleasure as he often sat there in his Japanese wicker chair shown in Leos photograph. It was a pretty verandah with tesselated floor, and wooden posts covered with little Virginian creeper, and with white clematis trained along the rafters, and Atlumia grown from A. Grays seed springing up in a big flower box in the corner & often decorated with big plants such as Vellota in pots.\" CUL-DAR140.3.1--159.
