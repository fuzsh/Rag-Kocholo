        "text": "Highlanders and Lowlanders\n\nShaw is a unique surname in Scotland in that it has at least two quite separate and unrelated origins and two distinct families, or kindred, have proudly borne the name throughout Scotland’s long and colourful story.\n\nThese unrelated families of Shaw have their origins in the lush pasturelands of the Lowlands and the stark beauty of the mist enshrouded mountains of the distant Highlands, and Shaws from both these widely separated geographical areas came to play significant roles in their nation’s often bloody history.\n\nIn the Highlands, the derivation of Shaw is from the Gaelic ‘sithech’, meaning a wolf, although another possible derivation is from the Gaelic ‘Na ‘Si’ach’, meaning ‘Son of the Tempest’, or ‘Son of the Snow.’ The Old Celtic version of the name is ‘scheagh’, or ‘sheagh’.\n\nWhatever the original derivation of the name, it is interesting to note that for many centuries ‘Shaw’ was a forename, and this explains why in the Highlands the Shaws were not known as Clan Shaw, but ‘the Shaw’ or, in Gaelic, ‘Na Siach’ or ‘Mhic Sheaghid’.\n\nToday, however, Clan Shaw is officially recognised as a Highland clan, and has its own proud motto of ‘By fidelity and fortitude’, and crest of a hand grasping a dagger.\n\nThe Lowland ‘Shaw’, or ‘Schawe’, stems from the Old English ‘scaga’, or ‘sceaga’, meaning a small area of woodland, and these Lowland Shaws became particularly prominent in Renfrewshire, Lanarkshire, and the Stirling area, with significant numbers also in Greenock, Ayrshire, and Kirkcudbrightshire and the main line of the Lowland Shaws are the Schaws of Sauchie, near Stirling, whose motto is ‘I mean well’ and whose crest, not particularly in keeping with this sentiment, is a savage wielding a cudgel!\n\nThe genealogy of the Highland Shaws is extremely complex, stretching back to the time of an ancient Celtic institution known as the Seven Earls of Scotland.\n\nOriginally known as mormaers (‘great stewards’) or thanes, these earls ruled the seven original Pictish sub-kingdoms in the northeast of Scotland of Atholl, Angus, Mar, Moray, Caithness, Strathearn, and Fife.\n\nDescended from the seven sons of Cruithne, an early Pictish king, they acted as provincial kings and even after the kingdom we now know as Scotland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin in 843 AD, they wielded great power in the selection of a new king on the death of the old.\n\nThe earls of Fife, for example, from time immemorial, had the right to perform the sacred ceremony of enthronement of a Scottish king, and it was a Shaw MacDuff, a younger son of a Thane of Fife, who was made keeper of the royal castle of Inverness during the reign from 1153-65 of Malcolm IV.\n\nIt is this Shaw MacDuff who is said to be the progenitor, or founder, of what became the distinct clan of Shaw.\n\nShaw MacDuff’s heirs were known as the ‘Mhic an Toiseach’ (‘the sons of the thane’, or ‘the sons of the chief’), and this Mhic an Toiseach became better known as ‘Mackintosh.’\n\nThis is why Clan Shaw today, although a clan in its own right, is recognised as a sept, or branch, of Clan Mackintosh.\n\nThrough Clan Mackintosh, the Shaws in turn also became members of the mighty confederation of clans known as Clan Chattan, which until as late as the eighteenth century was the main power in the Badenoch region of the Spey Valley.\n\nWith its motto of ‘Touch not the cat without a glove’, and crest of a rampant wildcat (the same as Clan Mackintosh), Clan Chattan also included MacPhersons, Farquharsons, MacThomases, McBains, Macleans, McGillivrays and Davidsons in its ranks.\n\nClan Chattan sided with the cause of Scotland’s independence under the great warrior king Robert the Bruce, and their motley but battle-hardened band of clansmen fought with distinction to help to achieve Bruce’s victory over the cream of English chivalry at the battle of Bannockburn, in 1314.\n\nIt was Shaw Macghillechrist Mhic Iain, more commonly known as ‘Sgorfhiaclach’ or ‘Bucktooth’, who was responsible for consolidating the power of what would become the distinct clan of Highland Shaws, through his prowess as a warrior.\n\nAs captain of Clan Chattan, he took part in an infamous raid into the shire of Angus in 1391 that ended in a fierce battle at Glen Brierachan.\n\nSir Walter Ogilvie of Auchterhouse, Sheriff of Angus, had called out a force of local magnates and lairds to defend the shire from the ravages of Duncan Stewart, a son of Alexander, Earl of Buchan, better known as the Wolf of Badenoch.\n\nShaw Bucktooth and his Chattan kinsfolk, ever eager for easy pickings, had joined with Stewart, and took part in the slaughter of Sir Walter and his puny force.\n\nFive years later, in 1396, Shaw Bucktooth led the Clan Chattan contingent in the famous Battle of the Clans that took place on a large, flat meadow on the outskirts of Perth known as the North Inch.\n\nA bitter feud had dragged out for some time between Clan Chattan and Clan Kay, a bloody vendetta that had not only visited mayhem on the clans themselves, but also periodically devastated the lives of their more peaceful neighbours.\n\nIn a desperate bid to resolve the matter, the monarch, Robert III, arranged for a gladiatorial combat between the two warring factions, watched by not only the king himself but a glittering array of courtiers and even the Dauphin of France.\n\nSixty champions were chosen from each side, with Shaw Bucktooth commanding the Chattan clansmen.\n\nArmed with a deadly arsenal of swords, dirks, axes, and allowed to shoot off one volley of crossbow bolts, the 120 warriors battled it out until only eleven Chattans, including Shaw, were left standing on the blood-soaked field of combat.\n\nThe sole Kay survivor took to his heels and swam for safety across the River Tay.\n\nShaw Bucktooth’s kin had lived for centuries in Rothiemurchus, but a grateful Mackintosh chief, the head of Clan Chattan, gifted him with possession of these lands ‘for all the valour he showed that day against his enemies.’\n\nThese lands were sold to the Grants in the sixteenth century, but Adam (or Ay), a grandson of Shaw Bucktooth had acquired lands at Tordarroch, in Strathnairn, in 1468. This family became known as Clan Aedh, or Ay (‘the children of Shaw’), and their lands are still held.\n\nIn 1970, the Lord Lyon King of Arms of Scotland recognised a Shaw of Tordarroch as 21st chief of Clan Shaw, after a vacancy of 200 years. This confirmed Clan Shaw as ‘a line of unbroken continuity from the ancient earls of Fife.’\n\nSepts of Clan Shaw include Ayson, Aison, Easson, MacAy, MacHay, Scaith, Scheach, Schiach, Shaith, Shay, Sheath, and Seith. There are also two Clan Shaw tartans, Shaw of Tordarroch and the green Shaw.\n\nThe green Shaw is derived from the regimental tartan of the famous Black Watch, and commemorates a Fearchar Shaw who, along with two of his fellows, was executed at Tower Hill, London, in 1743 for refusing to serve overseas in Britain’s foreign wars.\n\nThe regiment had mutinied after the government broke its pledge that it would not have to serve overseas, and Fearchar Shaw and his companions were selected as ‘examples’ to crush further mutiny.\n\nFor the Stuart cause\n\nThe Shaws were ardent in their devotion to the Royal House of Stuart throughout all of its tragic misfortunes, and the Shaws of Tordarroch raised a force to join Clan Chattan in its support of the Royalist James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, during his great campaigns from 1644 to 1645 in support of Charles I.\n\nThis period became known as the Year of Miracles because of Montrose’s brilliant military successes, including victory over the Presbyterian forces of the Earl of Argyll at Inverlochy in February of 1645.\n\nWhat made this victory all the more remarkable was that his hardy band of clansmen, including Shaws under the Clan Chattan banner, had arrived at Inverlochy after a tortuous 36-hour march south through deep snow from the area of present day Fort Augustus.\n\nClan Chattan also shared in Montrose’s victory at Kilsyth in August of 1645, but also in his defeat at Philiphaugh, near Selkirk, less than a month later.\n\nThe Shaws also paid dearly for their support of the Stuart cause in the Jacobite Risings of 1715 and 1745. Jacobite unrest had risen following the Hanoverian succession to the throne under George, Elector of Hanover, in 1714, and in September of the following year the Earl of Mar raised the Royal Standard of the Stuarts at Braemar.\n\nIt was at Farr, near Tordarroch, that only a few days later William Mackintosh of Borlum called out Clan Chattan to fight for the cause, and Robert Shaw of Tordarroch and his brother, Angus, led what was described as a highly disciplined and well-equipped contingent of Shaws.\n\nBut, plagued by bad leadership and squabbles over what military strategy to adopt, the Jacobite campaign was doomed almost from the start.\n\nThe cause was effectively lost following the battle of Sheriffmuir in November, when Mar lost the initiative against the Hanoverian forces led by John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, by withdrawing to Perth.\n\nMackintosh of Borlum had meanwhile displayed military genius by managing to cross the Firth of Forth with his hardy band of kinsmen and joining up with Jacobite sympathisers in southwest Scotland and northeast England, but they were captured at Preston.\n\nRobert and Angus Shaw were taken south and imprisoned in the Tower of London.\n\nAngus was among those Jacobites transported to Virginia, where he remained until he was pardoned in 1722. Returning to his Tordarroch estates he learned his brother, Robert, had died soon after his release from captivity in 1718.\n\nSoured by his own experiences and the loss of his brother, Angus Shaw was understandably reluctant to lend his support to Prince Charles Edward Stuart’s Rising of 1745, but numerous other Shaws rallied to the doomed cause.\n\nBy the time of the ’45 Rising the chief of Clan Mackintosh was a captain in the Black Watch and had raised a company to fight on the government, or Hanoverian, side.\n\nBut this did not prevent his wife, the young and beautiful Lady Anne Mackintosh, from raising about 300 Chattan clansmen to fight for her prince.\n\nTwo of her main lieutenants in what became Lady Mackintosh’s Regiment were a James and a John Shaw of Kinrara and, under the command of Colonel Alexander MacGillivray of Dunmaglas, the regiment fought with great distinction at the battle of Culloden on April 16, 1746.\n\nColonel MacGillivray was killed after the regiment, in the centre of the Jacobite front line, made a headlong charge into Barrel’s Regiment.\n\nLady Anne, known as ‘Colonel Anne’, and whom the prince dubbed his ‘belle rebelle’, was imprisoned for a time at Inverness after this battle that dashed Jacobite hopes forever.\n\nOne of the most brutal of the Hanoverian commanders, Lieutenant-General Henry Hawley, known as ‘Hangman Hawley’, was so incensed with the deference with which his officers treated his beautiful and aristocratic captive that he infamously threatened: ‘Damn the woman, I’ll honour her with mahogany gallows and a silken cord!’\n\nFortunately for Lady Anne this proved to be an empty threat, and she was later released.\n\nThe colours of Lady Mackintosh’s Regiment were the only ones not to be later ignominiously burned by the public hangman in Edinburgh. This was thanks to a Donald Mackintosh, who ripped them from the fallen and bloody standard, wrapped them around his body, and escaped from the carnage of the battlefield.\n\nRead more\n\nInvasion and civil war\n\nRanked 59th in some lists of the top 100 surnames found in England today, ‘Shaw’ is of truly ancient roots.\n\nDerived from the Old English ‘sceaga’, indicating a small wood, or copse, it is a locational surname that would originally have been borne by someone who lived in, or near, such a topographical location.\n\nAlthough a name that is prevalent throughout the British Isles today – with the Irish and Scottish-Gaelic forms derived from ‘sideach’, meaning ‘wolf’ – it is first recorded in the present day English county of Berkshire.\n\nThis was in 1191, but bearers of what would become the Shaw name – in now redundant forms such as ‘Schagwe’ – were present from much earlier times.\n\nThis means that flowing through the veins of many English bearers of the name today may well be the blood of those Germanic tribes who invaded and settled in the south and east of the island of Britain from about the early fifth century.\n\nKnown as the Anglo-Saxons, they were composed of the Jutes, from the area of the Jutland Peninsula in modern Denmark, the Saxons from Lower Saxony, in modern Germany and the Angles from the Angeln area of Germany.\n\nIt was the Angles who gave the name ‘Engla land’, or ‘Aengla land’ – better known as ‘England.’\n\nThey held sway in what became England from approximately 550 to 1066, with the main kingdoms those of Sussex, Wessex, Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, East Anglia and Essex.\n\nWhoever controlled the most powerful of these kingdoms was tacitly recognised as overall ‘king’ – one of the most noted being Alfred the Great, King of Wessex from 871 to 899.\n\nIt was during his reign that the famous Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was compiled – an invaluable source of Anglo-Saxon history – while Alfred was designated in early documents as Rex Anglorum Saxonum, King of the English Saxons.\n\nThrough the Anglo-Saxons, the language known as Old English developed, later transforming from the eleventh century into Middle English – sources from which many popular English surnames of today, such as Shaw, derive.\n\nAnglo-Saxon supremacy ended with the Norman Conquest of 1066, a pivotal moment in England’s history.\n\nBy this date, England had become a nation with several powerful competitors to the throne.\n\nIn what were extremely complex family, political and military machinations, the king was Harold II, who had succeeded to the throne following the death of Edward the Confessor.\n\nBut his right to the throne was contested by two powerful competitors – his brother-in-law King Harold Hardrada of Norway, in alliance with Tostig, Harold II’s brother, and Duke William II of Normandy.\n\nIn what has become known as The Year of Three Battles, Hardrada invaded England and gained victory over the English king on September 20 at the battle of Fulford, in Yorkshire.\n\nFive days later, however, Harold II decisively defeated his brother-in-law and brother at the battle of Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut he had little time to celebrate his victory, having to immediately march south from Yorkshire to encounter a mighty invasion force, led by Duke William of Normandy that had landed at Hastings, in East Sussex.\n\nHarold’s battle-hardened but exhausted force of Anglo-Saxon soldiers confronted the Normans on October 14, drawing up a strong defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill, building a shield wall to repel William’s cavalry and infantry.\n\nThe Normans suffered heavy losses but, through a combination of the deadly skill of their archers and the ferocious determination of their cavalry, they eventually won the day.\n\nAnglo-Saxon morale had collapsed on the battlefield as word spread through the ranks that Harold had been killed – the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings.\n\nWilliam was declared King of England on December 25, and the complete subjugation of his Anglo-Saxon subjects followed.\n\nThose Normans who had fought on his behalf were rewarded with the lands of Anglo-Saxons, many of whom sought exile abroad as mercenaries.\n\nWithin an astonishingly short space of time, Norman manners, customs and law were imposed on England – laying the basis for what subsequently became established ‘English’ custom and practice.\n\nBut beneath the surface, old Anglo-Saxon culture was not totally eradicated, with some aspects absorbed into those of the Normans, while faint echoes of the Anglo-Saxon past is still seen today in the form of popular surnames such as Shaw.\n\nThe name figures prominently in the frequently turbulent drama that is England’s history, one key event of which is the seventeenth century English Civil War.\n\nBy the very nature of civil war, many found themselves on opposing sides of the bitter conflict, and embroiled in it was the preacher John Shawe, born in 1608 in Ecclesfield, in what is now the West Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nThe monarch Charles I had incurred the wrath of Parliament by his insistence on the ‘divine right’ of monarchs, and added to this was Parliament’s fear of Catholic ‘subversion’ against the state and the king’s stubborn refusal to grant demands for religious and constitutional concessions.\n\nMatters came to a head with the outbreak of the war in 1642, with Parliamentary forces, known as the New Model Army and commanded by Oliver Cromwell and Sir Thomas Fairfax, arrayed against the Royalist army of the king.\n\nIn what became an increasingly bloody and complex conflict, spreading to Scotland and Ireland and with rapidly shifting loyalties on both sides, the king was eventually captured and executed in January of 1649 on the orders of Parliament.\n\nAn adherent of the strict Puritan religious faith, John Shawe became a preacher after studying at Christ’s College, Cambridge, and was forced to flee the university town in 1629 after a devastating outbreak of plague.\n\nWhen the civil war erupted, he was a preacher in Rotherham and, when the town was attacked by a Royalist force that had marked him out as a vociferous opponent of Charles I, he had to hide for a time in the town steeple.\n\nIn September of 1644 he was present in York, playing a prominent role in the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant – an alliance between the English and Scottish parliaments for the establishment of the Presbyterian religion.\n\nDuring the period in England known as the Protectorate – with Oliver Cromwell as ‘Lord Protector’ – Shawe became a favourite of Cromwell, often preaching before him.\n\nDespite his anti-Royalist and anti-Catholic stance, however, he was able to seek an accommodation with the new government regime following the Restoration of Charles I in 1660 – even obtaining the post of a royal chaplain and attending the monarch’s coronation.\n\nHis Puritan sympathies rose to the fore again, however, and he was accordingly banned for a time from preaching before his death in 1672.\n\nFame and notoriety\n\nFrom the destruction of civil war to rather more peaceful and constructive pursuits, John Shaw was the great late eighteenth century English architect credited with having been the first to devise plans for semi-detached housing in London.\n\nBorn in 1776 in Bexley, Kent, the son of a surgeon, he trained as an architect under his cousin George Gwilt, and went on to become involved in major projects that include the redesign of Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire, Ilam Hall, in Derbyshire and, as architect to Ramsgate Harbour, Kent, the design of its famous dock house and stairway known as Jacob’s Ladder.\n\nA Fellow of the scientific think-tank the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries of London, he died in 1832.\n\nAlthough he had been the first to draw up plans for semi-detached housing in London, it was his son, also John Shaw, who put the plans into effect.\n\nBorn in 1803, he was responsible for the first semi-detached villas in the Chalk Farm area of the city.\n\nHe died in 1870, while his brother Thomas Budd Shaw was a tutor in St Petersburg to the grand dukes of Russia, and his sister Julia was married to the eminent English architect Philip Hardwick.\n\nFrom architecture to the world of political activism, Anna Howard Shaw was a leading light of the suffrage movement in the United States – the struggle for equal voting and other rights for women.\n\nNot only a physician but also one of the first ordained female Methodist ministers in America, she was born in 1847 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, immigrating with her family when she was aged four.\n\nHer father became a campaigner for the Abolition Movement to free slaves, but neglected to care for his own family – leaving Anna and her invalid mother to eke out a difficult living from their small homestead in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\n\nThis involved back-breaking toil digging ditches and felling trees – tasks that gave her a sense of her own capabilities and independence and a fervent desire to better the lot of women.\n\nHer evenings were spent trying to earn money from work as a seamstress while, also studying late into the night for medical college, she was able to graduate from Boston University in 1886.\n\nOrdained a Methodist minister and preaching on themes such as abstention from alcohol, she became chair of the Franchise Department of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and a campaigner for the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). She died in 1919, while in 2000 she was posthumously inducted into America’s National Women’s Hall of Fame.\n\nOf a much different background from Anna Howard Shaw, Robert Gould Shaw II was the wealthy American socialite of what is known as the nation’s ‘Gilded Age.’ This was a period when vast fortunes were enjoyed by a select few, contrasted by the poverty suffered by many others.\n\nTruly born with a silver spoon in his mouth in Boston in 1872, and also known as RGSII, he was a member of one of the city’s most prominent families.\n\nHis cousin, also Robert Gould Shaw, born in 1837, had been a leading Union Army officer during the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 and commanded the famous 54th Regiment of African-American soldiers who fought with great distinction at the battle of Fort Wagner in July of 1863. Shaw was killed in the battle.\n\nRobert Gould Shaw II, however, gained notoriety rather than distinction.\n\nIn 1897 he married Nancy Witcher Langhorne, daughter of the American railroad tycoon Chisney Dasney Langhorne. It was not exactly a marriage made in heaven – with Nancy actually separating from her alcoholic husband on the night of their honeymoon.\n\nThe couple eventually divorced in 1903, and Shaw died in 1930, while in 1903 Nancy married Waldorf Astor, from one of the wealthiest families in England at the time, and settled in the family estate of Cliveden, Buckinghamshire.\n\nBecoming in 1909 the first woman to sit as a Member of Parliament (MP,) and later known as Nancy, Viscountess Astor, she died in 1964.\n\nThrough her first marriage, she was the mother of Robert Gould Shaw III, born in 1898.\n\nIn common with his father, he had an unfortunate relationship with alcohol and, in the bigoted times of his day, was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment in an English jail for what was perceived as the heinous crime of ‘homosexual offences.’ A deeply troubled man, he committed suicide in 1971.\n\nNot only a literary figure but also a soldier, explorer and archaeologist, Major William Boyd Kennedy Shaw was born in 1901 in Teffont Magna, Wiltshire.\n\nCarrying out explorations of the Libyan Desert in the 1920s and 1930s, during the Second World War he became one of the founding members of the elite British military unit the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) – a forerunner of today’s Special Air Service (SAS).\n\nIn addition to a number of articles he penned for the Royal Geographical Society, he was also the author of the 1945 Long Range Desert Group; awarded an OBE, he died in 1979.\n\nIn the murky worlds of assassination and conspiracy theory, Clay LaVerne Shaw was the prominent New Orleans businessman accused of having been involved – along with David Ferrie, Guy Bannister and rogue elements of the CIA – in the assassination in Dallas in November of 1963 of John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States.\n\nBorn in 1913, he had served with distinction during the Second World War, earning decorations that included the United States’ Legion of Merit and France’s Croix de Guerre.\n\nInstrumental in the years after the war in establishing New Orleans’ International Trade Mart and also in preserving buildings in the city’s French Quarter, it was in 1967 that New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison arrested him for alleged involvement in the Kennedy assassination.\n\nUnder the alias of ‘Clay Bertrand’, Garrison claimed, Shaw had been instrumental in the assassination along with other right-wing elements. The case eventually came to court in 1969, but Shaw was acquitted, as detailed in Garrison’s subsequent best-selling book On the Trail of the Assassins.\n\nIn 1979, Richard Helms, a former director of the CIA, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations that Shaw had been on a part-time contract with the agency’s Domestic Contact Service – furnishing it with information he gleaned from his business travels throughout Latin America.\n\nThe committee also determined that Shaw had indeed been in contact with not only David Ferrie but also Lee Harvey Oswald, identified in the Warren Commission Report as having been the gunman who shot and killed the president from the window of a school books’ depository in Dallas.\n\nShaw died in 1974, while he was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in the 1991 film on the assassination and Garrison’s dogged efforts to uncover the truth, JFK.\n\nRead more\n\nKnights of war\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Thomond in the northern reaches of Munster, which, along with Ulster, Leinster and Connacht make up the four provinces of the Emerald Isle, was from earliest times the homeland of bearers of the Sheehan name.\n\nÓ Siodhacháin and Ó Siocháin are the Gaelic-Irish forms of the name, and it is considered by some authorities to derive from ‘siodhach’, denoting ‘peaceful’, or ‘peacemaker.’\n\nThis may explain why the crest on the Sheehan coat of arms features a dove holding an olive branch in its beak.\n\nBut the lives and times of the Sheehans were certainly far from peaceful, frequently embroiled as they were in inter-clan rivalries and battles to repel foreign invaders.\n\nA truly native Irish clan, their pedigree is regal – descended as they are from the island’s earliest royal dynasty.\n\nThis is through Heber who, along with Heremon, Ir and Amergin and four other brothers, was a son of Milesius – a king of what is now modern day Spain, and who had planned to invade Ireland in fulfilment of a mysterious prophecy.\n\nMilesius died before he could embark on the invasion but his sons, including Heber, Ir, Heremon and Amergin, successfully undertook the daunting task in his stead in about 1699 B.C.\n\nLegend holds that their invasion fleet was scattered in a storm and Ir killed when his ship was driven onto the island of Scellig-Mhicheal, off the coast of modern day Co. Kerry.\n\nOnly Heremon, Heber, and Amergin survived, although Ir left issue.\n\nHeremon and Heber became the first of the Milesian monarchs of Ireland, but Heremon later killed Heber in a quarrel said to have been caused by their wives, while Amergin was slain by Heremon in an argument over territory.\n\nIn addition to being of the line of Heber, along with other proud clans that include those of Brady, Brennan, Carroll, O’Brien, O’Connor, O’Hara, O’Neill, O’Sullivan and McNamara, the Sheehans are also recognised as being of the Race of Cas – also known as the DalgCais, or Dalcassians.\n\nThe Dalcassians were named from the legendary Cormac Cas, the early to mid-third century chieftain of Munster who was renowned for his remarkable courage, strength and dexterity.\n\nIt was he who inflicted a celebrated defeat on the men of the province of Leinster in a battle fought near present day Wexford, but was killed in battle in 254 A.D. at Dun-tri-Liag, or the Fort of the Stone Slabs, known today as Duntrileague, in Co. Limerick.\n\nHis deathblow, according to the ancient annals, came from the spear of the Leinster king known as Eochy of the Red Eyebrows.\n\nCormac Cas was also an ancestor of the great warrior king Brian Boru, also known as Brian Bóruma, and who gave his name to the clan of O’Brien.\n\nA son of Cennetig, a Dalcassian king, Boru had by 1002 A.D. achieved the prize of the High Kingship of Ireland – but there were still rival chieftains, and not least the Vikings, to deal with.\n\nMainly of Norwegian origin, it was in the closing years of the eighth century A.D. that their sinister longboats first appeared off Irish shores, and the monastery of St. Patrick’s Island, near Skerries in present day Co. Dublin, was looted and burned to the ground.\n\nRaids continued along the coastline until they made their first forays inland in 836 A.D., while a year later a Viking fleet of 60 vessels sailed into the River Boyne.\n\nAn indication of the terror they brought can be found in one contemporary account of their depredations and desecrations.\n\nIt lamented how ‘the pagans desecrated the sanctuaries of God, and poured out the blood of saints upon the altar, laid waste the house of our hope, trampled on the bodies of saints in the temple of God, like dung in the street.’\n\nBy 841 A.D. the Vikings, or Ostmen as they were also known, had established a number of strongholds on the island, but their raids began to ease off before returning with a terrifying and bloody vengeance in about 914 A.D.\n\nThey met with a determined resistance from the native Irish, most notably in the form of the forces of the powerful confederation of clans known as the southern Uí Neill.\n\nThe Irish suffered a resounding defeat at the battle of Dublin in 919 A.D., and it was not until just over thirty years later that the raids gradually came to an end.\n\nBy this time they had established permanent settlements in Ireland, particularly in Dublin and other coastal areas such as present day Waterford, Wexford, Carlingford and Strangford – indeed the names of the latter four stem from the Old Norse language of the Scandinavians.\n\nResenting Brian Boru’s High Kingship, a number of chieftains found common cause with the Ostmen, and the two sides met in final and bloody confrontation at Clontarf, north of Dublin, on the Good Friday of 1014.\n\nThe High King proved victorious, with Sheehans in the ranks of his famed Dalcassian knights, but the annals speak of great slaughter on the day, with the dead piled high on the field of battle and hundreds of Vikings drowned as they sought the safety of their ships.\n\nAmong the many dead were Brian Boru’s three sons, Murrough, Conaing and Moltha – while he had little time to celebrate his victory, being killed in his tent by a party of fleeing Vikings led by Brodar the Dane.\n\nThe first to enter the tent had his legs cut off with one mighty sweep of Boru’s two-handed sword.\n\nBrodar then struck him a fatal blow on the back of his head with his axe, but he rallied the last of his dying strength to cut off his assailant’s head with another sweep of his sword before killing yet another Viking.\n\nBoru and all who fought for him at the battle of Clontarf, including forebears of the Sheehans of today, passed into legend, and the warrior king was buried in a stone coffin on the north side of the high altar in Armagh church.\n\nThe victory at Clontarf brought peace to the island for a time and the Sheehans flourished in the barony of Lower Connello, in Co. Limerick, where they served as chiefs of the barony.\n\nBut ‘peace’ was very much a relative term, as the clans throughout the island’s four provinces periodically engaged in warfare with one another in disputes over territory or perceived insults to their honour – a Celtic trait they shared with their counterparts in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.\n\nIt was this disunity that had previously worked to the advantage of the Viking invaders, but it was to have even more serious consequences for the Sheehans and other Gaelic-Irish clans in the late 12th century when a power struggle between rivals for the High Kingship boiled over into civil war.\n\nSword of rebellion\n\nBy 1156 the most powerful of the sub-kings vying for the High Kingship of the island was Muirchertach MacLochlainn, king of the O’Neills.\n\nThe equally powerful Rory O’Connor, king of the province of Connacht, opposed him but he increased his power and influence by allying himself with Dermot MacMurrough, king of Leinster.\n\nMacLochlainn and MacMurrough were aware that the main key to the kingdom of Ireland was the thriving trading port of Dublin, and their combined forces seized it.\n\nBut when MacLochlainn died the Dubliners rose up in revolt and overthrew the unpopular MacMurrough.\n\nThere had certainly been no love lost between MacMurrough and the Dubliners – who had not only killed his father but as an added insult buried his corpse beside that of a dead dog.\n\nA triumphant Rory O’Connor entered Dublin and was later inaugurated as Ard Rí, but MacMurrough refused to accept defeat.\n\nHe appealed for help from England’s Henry II in unseating O’Connor, an act that was to radically affect the future course of Ireland’s fortunes.\n\nThe English monarch agreed to help MacMurrough, but distanced himself from direct action by delegating his Norman subjects in Wales with the task.\n\nThese ambitious and battle-hardened barons and knights had first settled in Wales following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and, with an eye on rich booty, plunder and lands, were only too eager to obey their sovereign’s wishes and furnish MacMurrough with military aid.\n\nTheir invasion fleet disembarked on the island in 1169, and so fierce and disciplined was their onslaught on the forces of Rory O’Connor and his allies that by 1171 they had recaptured Dublin, in the name of MacMurrough, and other strategically important territories.\n\nMcMurrough died soon afterwards, by which time the Norman invaders virtually controlled the island in the name of Henry II.\n\nEnglish dominion over Ireland was ratified through the Treaty of Windsor of 1175, under the terms of which O’Connor, for example, was allowed to rule territory unoccupied by the Normans only in the role of a vassal of the king.\n\nAs further waves of Anglo-Norman adventurers descended on the island, conditions became extremely harsh for the Gaelic-Irish clans such as the Sheehans.\n\nAn indication of their suffering can be found in a desperate plea sent to Pope John XII by Roderick O’Carroll of Ely, Donald O’Neill of Ulster, and a number of other Irish chieftains in 1318.\n\nThey stated: ‘As it very constantly happens, whenever an Englishman, by perfidy or craft, kills an Irishman, however noble, or however innocent, be he clergy or layman, there is no penalty or correction enforced against the person who may be guilty of such wicked murder.\n\n‘But rather the more eminent the person killed and the higher rank which he holds among his own people, so much more is the murderer honoured and rewarded by the English, and not merely by the people at large, but also by the religious and bishops of the English race.’\n\nConditions deteriorated further through a policy of ‘plantation’, or settlement of loyal Protestants on land held by native Irish that was started during the reign from 1491 to 1547 of Henry VIII, whose Reformation effectively outlawed the established Roman Catholic faith throughout his dominions.\n\nThis plantation continued throughout the subsequent reigns of Elizabeth I, James I and in the wake of the Cromwellian invasion of 1649.\n\nFor the Sheehans and other native Irish, the only recourse was to take up the sword of rebellion against the powerful forces of the Crown.\n\nThe Sheehan homeland of the province of Munster was particularly devastated by war, plague and famine in the First Desmond Rebellion of 1569 to 1573 and again through the Second Desmond Rebellion of 1579 to 1583.\n\nFurther devastation again hit the island, from 1594 to 1603, in what is known as the Nine Years War.\n\nAll of these rebellions, although meeting with some spectacular victories, proved abortive in the end.\n\nThis led to the imposition of severe reprisals against not only the rebels but also the Gaelic-Irish population in general.\n\nBut this did not prevent another insurrection exploding in 1641,when at least 2,000 Protestant settlers were massacred and thousands more stripped of their belongings and driven from their lands to seek refuge where they could.\n\nEngland had its own distractions with the Civil War that culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649, and from 1641 to 1649 Ireland was ruled by a rebel group known as the Irish Catholic Confederation, or the Confederation of Kilkenny.\n\nBut following the execution of Charles I, England’s ‘Lord Protector’ Oliver Cromwell descended on Ireland at the head of a 20,000-strong army that landed at Ringford, near Dublin, in August of 1649.\n\nHe had three main aims: these were to quash all forms of rebellion, to ‘remove’ all Catholic landowners who had taken part in the rebellion, and to convert the native Irish to the Protestant faith.\n\nA reign of Cromwellian terror followed, with his steel-helmeted troopers given free rein to hunt down and kill priests, while rebel estates such as those of the Sheehans were confiscated and the dispossessed native Irish banished to Connacht and Co. Clare.\n\nAn edict was issued stating that any native Irish found east of the River Shannon after May 1, 1654, faced either summary execution or transportation to the West Indies.\n\nWhat is perceived by many as the final death knell of the ancient Gaelic order of clans such as the Sheehans was sounded in 1688 in what is known as Cogadh an Dá Rí, or The War of the Two Kings.\n\nAlso known as the Williamite War in Ireland, it was sparked off when the Stuart monarch James II (James VII of Scotland), under threat from powerful factions who feared a return to the dominance of Roman Catholicism under his rule, fled into French exile.\n\nThe Protestant William of Orange and his wife Mary were invited to take up the thrones of Scotland, Ireland, and England – but James had significant Catholic support in Ireland.\n\nHis supporters were known as Jacobites, and among them was a Captain William Sheehan.\n\nFollowing the arrival in England of William and Mary from Holland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell and James’s Lord Deputy in Ireland, assembled an army loyal to the Stuart cause, and Captain Sheehan’s name can be found on the muster roll for this army.\n\nThe aim was to garrison and fortify the island in the name of James and quell any resistance.\n\nLondonderry, or Derry, proved loyal to the cause of William of Orange, or William III as he had become, and managed to hold out against a siege that was not lifted until July 28, 1689, the starving citizens having been reduced to eating rats.\n\nJames, with the support of 10,000 troops, supplies and money supplied by Louis XIV of France, had sailed from Brest and landed at Kinsale in March of 1689 and joined forces with his Irish supporters.\n\nMarching to Dublin and gathering more Jacobite support along the way, he set up a Parliament in the city.\n\nWilliam, meanwhile, despatched the veteran Dutch soldier Marshall Schomburg to Ireland with a 10,000-strong force that landed in Belfast Lough and occupied Carrickfergus.\n\nThe next few months continued in a state of stalemate, with William’s forces in the north and the bulk of the Jacobites in the south.\n\nSeeking to break the deadlock, William himself descend-ed on the island in June of 1690 with an additional 35,000 troops and set off for Dublin.\n\nThe Jacobites marched north to meet him and the two forces finally clashed on the morning of July 12, 1690, in the battle of the Boyne – William narrowly escaping death before the battle proper began when a sniper’s bullet grazed his shoulder while he was breakfasting on the north bank of the Boyne river.\n\nThe Jacobites were routed, and among their many dead was Captain William Sheehan.\n\nJames fled again into French exile, never to return, while another significant Jacobite defeat occurred in July of 1691 at the battle of Aughrim – with about half their army killed on the field, wounded or taken prisoner.\n\nThe Williamite forces besieged Limerick and the Jacobites were forced to surrender in September of 1691.\n\nA peace treaty known as the Treaty of Limerick followed, under which those willing to swear an oath of loyalty to William were allowed to remain in their native land.\n\nThose reluctant to do so, including many native Irish such as the Sheehans, chose foreign exile – their ancient homelands lost to them forever.\n\nRead more"
