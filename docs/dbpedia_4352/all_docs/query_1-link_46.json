        "text": "Christopher Eccleston‘s Ninth Doctor in Doctor Who is popular among the show’s fans and is credited for having re-established the sci-fi series following its 1996-2005 hiatus, despite his short tenure. As such, following his departure from the series, fans have often wondered as to why he left and are curious about whether or not he will return. Here is all you need to know.\n\nWhy did Christopher Eccleston leave Doctor Who?\n\nChristopher Eccleston left Doctor Who due to his dissatisfaction and discomfort with the work environment and also because of the breakdown of his relationship with the showrunner, producer, and co-producer.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with Evening Standard, Eccleston revealed that he left the series after just one season due to his dissatisfaction with the work environment and because of his discomfort over how he, his co-stars, and fellow crew members were treated on sets and during production.\n\nIn a later interview with Radio Times, Eccleston expressed that the dissolution of his relationships with his three immediate superiors: the showrunner, producer, and co-producer, which never recovered also contributed to his decision to leave the show.\n\nHe later reiterated his sentiments at an NYCC Panel in 2019 attended by Den of Geek where he also stated that he left the show because of their politics and that he did not want to get involved in those politics.\n\nWill Christopher Eccleston ever return to Doctor Who?\n\nChristopher Eccleston’s return to Doctor Who in any capacity has not been officially confirmed.\n\nHowever, the Ninth Doctor actor has revealed bluntly what it would take for him to return to the franchise. At the For the Love of Sci-Fi fan convention, he bluntly stated that he would only return to the franchise if Russell T. Davies, Jane Tranter, Phill Colinson, and Julie Gardner were removed from the show. He then sarcastically asked whether that could be arranged."
