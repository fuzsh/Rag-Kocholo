        "text": "Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston will be returning to science-fiction with a BBC Radio 4 play.\n\nChristopher has joined the cast of Radio 4's adaptation of the 1963 novel The Man Who Fell to Earth, which has previously been made into a film starring David Bowie and a TV series with Chiwetel Ejiofor.\n\nAccording to The Radio Times, Christopher will be starring in the radio version alongside Harry Treadaway (Star Trek: Picard) — with the latter playing mysterious space traveler Thomas Jerome Newton.\n\nRelated: Here's how to watch Doctor Who's entire Whoniverse in the right order\n\nNewton arrives on Earth with a plot to use the planet's technology to make himself rich and then bring the last remaining people from his world to live on Earth.\n\nAlong the way, Newton begins to question his mission when he is befriended by earthlings Betty-Jo and Nathan Bryce, as the US government is keeping a close eye on them all.\n\nRadio 4's version of The Man Who Fell to Earth has cast Christopher as the widowed scientist Nathan Bryce, while Laura Aikman (Gavin & Stacey) will play Betty-Jo.\n\nThe radio play has been adapted by former EastEnders and Casualty writer Stephen Keyworth and will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, May 12 at 3pm.\n\nAs for whether Christopher will ever play that other famous spaceman again, he recently suggested he would only return to Doctor Who if the current production team were sacked given his trouble with them during the 2005 relaunch.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who’s Billie Piper addresses Christopher Eccleston's \"hard time\" on show\n\nNevertheless, producer Russell T Davies subsequently credited the actor with “singlehandedly” changing the show with his portrayal of the Ninth Doctor.\n\nDoctor Who will return for its 14th series on May 11 at midnight, airing on BBC One in the UK and Disney+ elsewhere. Classic episodes of Doctor Who are available on BBC iPlayer in the UK.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
