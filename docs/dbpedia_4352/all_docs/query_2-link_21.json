        "text": "He has already explained this and its sad he keeps getting asked questions about it, he didn't agree with some of the people at the top, there was issues with the workplace how people were being treated and so forth. He's not going to say more as he's professional and there's no real point, its not going to achieve anything and could come across as sniping. I think Chris was very gracious in what he said here and that its just his side and the other people are not here to give their side so its not fair to talk about it, good on him rise above the crap interviewers who are just dragging this up because they want some cheap dirt to print and its easier to do than to actually spend a few minutes and think up some interesting questions to ask him. Bah Humbug.\n\n0\n\nI wouldn't get too upset P.Skin, Chris obviously didn't mind being asked on this occasion. He would have stipulated 'no Doctor Who questions' if he was bothered or done a 'Bee Gees ' if he didn't like it.\n\nI think if he is specifically promoting a show he is in, he asks not to be asked about Who. He is still rightly proud of his Doctor and does accept it as part of his career. But he likes to control what he says and when he says it. Nowt wrong with that in the circumstances.\n\n0\n\nI heard him on Radio 2 a few years ago making references to how poorly treated some of the Doctor Who team (runners etc) were by senior staff. He said during that interview that he left because he didn't want to be a part of a show where junior staff were treated so badly.\n\nI do have a few observations though:\n\n1/ It's Chris who has a reputation for being prickly/difficult to work with\n\n2/ Russell T Davies, Phil Collinson and Julie Gardner appeared to be quite loved by the team - certainly, Chris is the only person I've heard make such accusations against them\n\n3/ There is a different version of the story which is: Chris went through a prolonged \"I will do season 2/I won't do season 2\" phase and in the end his indecision was putting production at risk so RTD made the decision to replace him.\n\nI have nothing against Christopher Eccleston. I just don't necessarily believe his version of events.\n\n0\n\nI'm 99% certain that it wasn't RTD. It doesn't gell with stories I've heard, and I know Eccleston and RTD were and are still friends after he left.\n\nThe story about Eccleston waffling about whether to do S2 or not and RTD casting Tennant while he was still deciding was invented by this one fan from the Philippines who claims one of the top execs emailed her to spill all the gossip. She loathes David Tennant with a passion and was determined to make everyone believe he's a backstabber who stole Eccleston's job out from under him. The story has been thoroughly debunked as it contradicts what all involved have said. The only way it could be true is if Eccleston, RTD, Tennant, Piper, and several others had invented an extremely detailed completely fictitious account of what happened and had stuck to telling those lies (in Eccleston's telling lies in order to protect the people who stabbed him in the back) for ten years.\n\n0\n\nI heard him on Radio 2 a few years ago making references to how poorly treated some of the Doctor Who team (runners etc) were by senior staff. He said during that interview that he left because he didn't want to be a part of a show where junior staff were treated so badly.\n\nI do have a few observations though:\n\n1/ It's Chris who has a reputation for being prickly/difficult to work with\n\n2/ Russell T Davies, Phil Collinson and Julie Gardner appeared to be quite loved by the team - certainly, Chris is the only person I've heard make such accusations against them\n\n3/ There is a different version of the story which is: Chris went through a prolonged \"I will do season 2/I won't do season 2\" phase and in the end his indecision was putting production at risk so RTD made the decision to replace him.\n\nI have nothing against Christopher Eccleston. I just don't necessarily believe his version of events.\n\nProbably the best write up of this I've seen.\n\nI love Chris' work on Doctor Who and in honesty, most of his acting roles, but he is one who always comes across as the issue, not anyone else. I read he had issues with John Barrowman, a guy loved by pretty much everyone he's ever worked with.\n\nAs for the production team abusing junior staff, it really isn't likely. Again RTD seems beloved by everyone whose worked with him and I struggle to believe that abuse would happen in 2005 and not be reported.\n\nI also put more stock in the will he won't he story. RTD would have been under pressure to announce a series 2 before series 1 ended so would have needed a decision. If Chris was dragging his heels in commiting then he would have had little choice but to replace.\n\n0\n\nI loved him in the role and am sure he's tired of being asked about his decision to leave.\n\nVirtually every interview I've read or heard he is very clear about being proud to have been the Doctor (his interaction with fans show this) but also very consistent in not providing full disclosure which he is perfectly entitled to do.\n\nIt would not be helpful to his career to be known as an actor who 'spills the beans' on behind the scenes issues - which is also refreshing these days.\n\nMy understanding was that there was a big problem with one of the directors of Series 1 (who hasn't returned) and their treatment of staff. I'm sure there were probably other issues but this one seemed the most plausible when I read it. And let's be honest - the scripts from series 2 would probably have made him a two series Doctor at most! :-)\n\n0\n\nI heard him on Radio 2 a few years ago making references to how poorly treated some of the Doctor Who team (runners etc) were by senior staff. He said during that interview that he left because he didn't want to be a part of a show where junior staff were treated so badly.\n\nI do have a few observations though:\n\n1/ It's Chris who has a reputation for being prickly/difficult to work with\n\n2/ Russell T Davies, Phil Collinson and Julie Gardner appeared to be quite loved by the team - certainly, Chris is the only person I've heard make such accusations against them\n\n3/ There is a different version of the story which is: Chris went through a prolonged \"I will do season 2/I won't do season 2\" phase and in the end his indecision was putting production at risk so RTD made the decision to replace him.\n\nI have nothing against Christopher Eccleston. I just don't necessarily believe his version of events.\n\nWell and I can only impart what I know and was told and you can make your own mind up whether to believe it or not.\n\nPersonally I dont disbelieve it.\n\nChris DID apply for the role.\n\nRTD Did originally want Hugh Grant or Bill Nighy. Never though Chris would be interested.\n\nThe best thing to say was that S 1 was a real trial by fire to get made. What was sold to Chris was not what i turned out to be. By necessity.\n\nThe main thing re the main players, was that things went a bit askew after Mal Young departed.\n\nIt wasnt Chris fell out with RTD. he couldnt get hold of him because of RTDs writing pressure to get everything rewritten.\n\nNo issue with Julie either.\n\nBut Julie had to be seen to support Phil. and Phil Collinson was frontline getting it done. He had people to report to. It was amazing S 1 got made at all or that it turned out to be so good and well recieved.\n\nand yes there were issues with two directors. But one gets the blame more than Euros does. and that was a major falling out.\n\nFactor that with some family issues he had at the time and the gruelling schedule.\n\nand yes, it would seem that they hired David without Chris knowing. They made Chris decision for him.\n\nSubsequent to that, FWIW, there was an agreement with RTD and the BBC with Chris. Neither would speak of it for 5 years. and Chis, practically to the day, spoke of it 5 years later. and Chris would agree to limited pre agreed media appearances.\n\nand that he would any atend the Cardiff launch of Rose , providing he had no contact with those he percieved as the issue.\n\nAgain, whats I was reliably told was that Chris was paid 2 million for 2 series and the fact he didnt work for the year after he departed certainly supports it bar limited voiceover work.\n\nMake of it what you wish.\n\n0\n\nI was reliably told that reliable sources used by people on the internet that are never named or alluded to (for protection sake of course) are very reliable indeed, and not at all a Frankenstein monster tale of cherry picked information from various little sound bites hear and there while adding in some bit of imagination with the timing of things said, make of that what you wish.\n\nDavid being hired behind Chris's back is plain (and proven) rubbish, but it makes for a nice juice tale of the behind the scenes of the DW production.\n\nThe agreeing not to speak about it for five years seems like nonsense, someone noticing it was that long until Chris decided to open up about some of the issues so they cease on that and with the idiots mentality that 'everything must have a designed reason and purpose' came up with the daft idea they couldn't talk about if for 5 years, Chris is a no nonsense kind of guy can you really see him agreeing to something so ridiculous and unnecessary as that, him saying what he has said was never going to effect DW in any bad way, if he had said the stuff a couple of months after he left it would of made no difference, its just that he didn't want to... buy hey that's boring so lets make a conspiracy huh.\n\nAlso Chris did work the year after DW so that's cobblers.\n\nThe rest of it seems like its at least in the realm of possibility and could be true, who knows, but it could all also be a load of rubbish like some of the points clearly are, its all stuff that's been thrown around in various forms since 2005.\n\n0\n\nChris himself has debunked the rumour that they cast David behind his back.\n\nUnless you can think of a reason he would spend TEN YEARS telling lies in order to protect the people who betrayed him?\n\nAnd David's told the story about the evening they first asked him to take the role and what happened the next day a million times, in a lot of detail. If the rumour was true it would mean his entire story was made up. And that David knowingly told a load of lies. Lies that dragged in multiple other people who don't even have any connection to DW, and apparently David somehow forced all of them to go along with his lies!\n\nPlease remember the source of this particular rumour and some of the other things she has said.\n\n0"
