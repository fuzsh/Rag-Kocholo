        "text": "I’m less than two months away from participating in the 2024 Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure on October 6! Every year, we unite in support of this cause because breast cancer affects so many of us – one in eight women are diagnosed, including team members, friends, family and clients. There are over 50 run sites across the country, where we all take part with a single goal: to change the future of breast cancer. So sign up and register with me at the link below. When we run for one, we run for all! https://lnkd.in/et_TJjCR #ProudToBeCIBC #RunForTheCure #BreastCancer\n\nIt’s team members like Winnie and Rose who are able to define their paths to success at CIBC —through the work they do, the ways they partner, and how they grow together. From Winnie: When I started at CIBC in 2020, a client wanted to purchase mutual funds. It wasn't my area of expertise, so I reached out to Rose. She followed up and set up the investments. The client was super happy. The two of us have been collaborating ever since. From Rose: I feel completely comfortable working with Winnie and her clients. Over the years, we've developed a strong track record. Clients often invite friends and family to meet with us and support their financial needs. We also work with many newcomers to Canada since we've both been in that position ourselves. Winnie: Having opportunities for regular collaboration also helps me and Rose provide more holistic and integrated services. When we can come together to help clients achieve their ambitions, it's so rewarding. Our strong teams drive us to strive for more, together.

Paying homage to the local community, the branch features a community wall with an image of a family overlooking the North Saskatchewan River Valley, a breathtaking sight located just 30 minutes away from the branch. As CIBC is always operating with clients in mind, the bank strives to innovate and incorporate modern designs to optimize the client experience. That's why this banking centre was designed to ensure a seamless and exceptional experience for our clients at every interaction.

The event featured case study challenges, networking opportunities, and hands-on experiences with generative AI (genAI) and mixed reality technologies, offering insights into leveraging AI in banking to enhance client experiences and product offerings. Ivey students delved in, emphasizing the importance of ethics and responsibility within the #AI space. A highlight was the genAI prompting challenge, where students tested their skills using a CIBC-built tool, showcasing their talents. This event underscored CIBC's dedication to innovation and industry advancements, with leaders demonstrating a commitment to forward-thinking approaches. The collaboration between CIBC and Ivey Business School at Western University exemplifies teamwork across departments and students from the IDIS program. As new trends and technologies continue to emerge, the contributions of these students, our future leaders, provide invaluable insights for the industry's evolution. #ProudToBeCIBC #TechLeadership #Innovation #AIatCIBC\n\nAt CIBC we believe that ambitions go further with someone in our corner, and we’re proud to provide a platform that brings every ambition to life, on and off the pitch. Over the course of the summer, we’ll be spotlighting inspiring stories that celebrate community, empowerment, and impact within women's soccer in partnership with TSN - The Sports Network - Canada. The first story features Team CIBC Athlete Christine Sinclair — although now retired from our national team, the unified culture of togetherness that she fostered is everlasting. She's a shining demonstration of how we can always go “further together”! #ProudToBeCIBC #FurtherTogether #AmbitionsMadeReal\n\nFrom Hannah: \"More than a decade ago, times were very different for members of the LGBTQ2+ community in Canada. It wasn’t something that was talked about, let alone celebrated. In school, I didn’t meet many people who were out. It could feel really isolating. The year I came out, I joined CIBC and immediately started volunteering with the CIBC Pride Network. I became co-lead in 2019. The network is full of passionate volunteers who host employee and community engagement events. We welcome anyone who wants to support the community, including allies and those interested in learning more. Through the network, I’ve gotten to connect with great people across the bank, executive sponsors and community partners like Casey House. Part of what kept me closeted in my younger years was the lack of LGBTQ2+ representation around me. That’s why it's so important now that I'm visible and proud of who I am. Hopefully, this will encourage others to do the same, so we can keep taking strides forward together.\" To learn about what it’s like to work at CIBC, visit: https://lnkd.in/gqfFZqjU #ProudToBeCIBC\n\nThis June 11 to 13 marks CIBC's Client Appreciation Days — which are all about celebrating the impact our clients have made! By choosing to be clients of CIBC, they empower us to make real change across Canada through CIBC Foundation. Together we support the work of thousands of incredible charities in communities across the country. We're so grateful to our clients for supporting our work, and immensely proud of our partnerships with community organizations as we come together with a shared purpose. For more information about the impacts the CIBC Foundation is making visit: https://lnkd.in/g8KcvzJU #ProudToBeCIBC #CIBCFoundation #ClientAppreciationDay\n\nFrom Amber: \"As American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters, we commit to being lifelong learners. It is a constant process of growth. Our job includes building trust. We're there for critical moments in people's lives. It is a great honour and responsibility. After 20 years in private practice, I joined CIBC as the first in-house interpreter. I now lead a team of designated interpreters, as well as a live captionist. I get to work alongside talented and professional Deaf team members who allow me to borrow their language every day. It's such a gift. My love for ASL and passion for accessibility align with CIBC as a purpose-led organization. We believe that equipping our Deaf employees with interpretation resources has a direct, positive impact on workplace dynamics. It helps build relationships and enrich the experience of the entire team. This is a responsibility I don’t take lightly. It was my dream to bring designated interpreting to the financial industry. CIBC is a leader in this space. I'm proud to work for a bank that values communication access and inclusion for Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing Canadians.\" To learn about our team's inclusive culture, visit https://lnkd.in/gH6nA3B2 #ProudToBeCIBC #Accessibility #ASL\n\nWhen Gwyneth joined CIBC, she never imagined that working at a bank would lead her to a role in technology where her creativity could shine.
