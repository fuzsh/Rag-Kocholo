        "text": "The Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) is set to meet his future wife, River Song, played by Alex Kingston, in the next set of Big Finish’s The Ninth Doctor Adventures.\n\nFor Star-Crossed, the final release in the current series of The Ninth Doctor Adventures, the Doctor and River visit a planet in thrall to a dating app, an intergalactic bank with a catastrophic glitch, and a raging maelstrom.\n\nThe three stories are:\n\nSwipe Right by John Dorney\n\nFace of the Apocalypse by Lizzie Hopley\n\nArchipelago by Tim Foley\n\nChristopher Eccleston said:\n\n“Returning to the world of the Doctor has been a great experience precisely because it has allowed me to re-explore my interpretation of the character and how he interacts with the many extraordinary beings he encounters along the way. Alex’s River was one such character and this was an interesting, challenging and enjoyable encounter for the Doctor too.”\n\nAlex Kingston said:\n\n“This is the first time that I’ve had an opportunity to work with Chris’s Doctor. It’s a challenge for River to step into his interpretation and navigate it. He’s got a different energy to any of the other Doctors – she has to work harder to engage him, to get through to him, which is great fun.”\n\nYou can buy The Ninth Doctor Adventures: Star-Crossed, released in May 2024, as part of a complete four-volume series bundle for just £108 (on CD box set + download) or £88 (download only), exclusively from Big Finish. It’s now available to pre-order for £29.99 (CD box set + download) or £22.99 (download only)."
