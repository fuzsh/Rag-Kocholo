        "text": "Welcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we’ll be discussing the longest-lasting Doctor (so far) in the show’s history, as well as one of the most iconic. This is the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWith the end of the Jon Pertwee era, the decision was made to take Doctor Who back to its roots, specifically looking at the era of Patrick Troughton. Tom Baker was not a well-known name, and in many ways, he played the Doctor more or less as himself: there is almost no separation between performer and character here, and that makes the performances almost universally grand. Right from day one, he established himself as drastically different from Jon Pertwee: gone was the authoritarian dandy who loved high-speed chases and karate chops, and in his place was an absolutely unhinged thrillseeker, who wanted to explore the universe just for the sake of it.\n\nBaker ADORED playing the Doctor, and to this date, he is the actor who has played the character the longest: in the show proper, he played the role for seven straight seasons, and ultimately only left because of personal and professional arguments with the head producer of the time, John Nathan Turner. By all accounts, Baker had a bit of an ego: he was once directly quoted as saying words to the effect that he knew more about the show than the writers did. As a writer myself, I think that’s dubious; as an actor, I find such commentary ill-advised. Keep in mind, Doctor Who was his big break: suddenly the man was a star, and he took that stardom seriously…but at the same time, one could easily argue the fame went to his head. By the time he left, regardless, Baker had made QUITE a mark: while the Fourth Doctor never properly appeared again on the show, he remains one of the most iconic to this day. Whenever people think of Doctor Who, Baker is usually one of the first incarnations they think of. For better or worse, the Fourth Doctor is truly immortal.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nThis Doctor was the first to deliberately pay homage (however indirectly) to Patrick Troughton’s. Much like Troughton, this Doctor was a shabby oddball who HATED to be tied down. However, things play out in a somewhat different fashion.\n\nA major character trait of the Fourth Doctor is his sort of Devil-May-Care habits: he almost never goes out to deliberately save people, unlike the Third Doctor. Instead, he’s usually just trying to escape and survive the mess, and as soon as everything’s cleaned up, he’s off and running without a second thought. Even when he IS out on a specific cause, he treats things with a sort of cavalier attitude, and he reserves the right to make his own choices: if he ultimately feels the objective of the mission is wrong, he will abandon the mission with little to no hesitation. In his very first episode, he does everything in his power to try and leave UNIT, and it takes a great deal of coaxing and prying for him to take anything seriously or stick around in that story…and once his job is done, he’s gone in a flash. That would be the typical formula throughout his era; this Doctor was heroic, but not necessarily a hero. In fact, another episode, “Face of Evil,” outright references his often irresponsible nature, as he finds out actions he did sometime in the past have had negative consequences…and yet, once he’s cleaned up the immediate problem, he’s quick to wipe his hands of things again and leave once more. He’s like a plumber who comes in, tightens a few screws, then leaves again only to come back when the pipes leak once more. The Second Doctor, in contrast to all this, was much more responsible: he was kooky, but he was also determined, and would stop at nothing to do whatever he felt was his sworn duty. Baker, very clearly, doesn’t care about duty: just about moving on.\n\nThe other major difference is the KIND of oddball Baker is in comparison to Troughton. Troughton’s Doctor was something of a nutty professor; an absent-minded goofball who was much more clever than he seemed. Tom Baker on the other hand…is completely and utterly BONKERS. This is the first Doctor where his sanity is often truly in question: with Troughton, you always knew he was just crazy like a fox, pretending to be mad and exaggerating his own silliness. With the Fourth Doctor…it’s no exaggeration, he’s just WEIRD. And while he will play dumb or exaggerate his silliness from time to time, he’s not particularly GOOD at it. It’s like he’s mocking his enemies rather than trying to outwit them: outright telling them, “Yes, I am onto you, I have a plan, and you will never know what it is till it’s too late!” He’s temperamental, energetic, and irrepressibly eccentric: his mood swings rapidly, and he has a motormouth you wouldn’t believe. The Doctor has always been a somewhat Sherlock Holmes-esque figure, and I think Baker was the first of the Time Lords to really tap into that: a man you didn’t always trust, but would always do the right thing, and whose brilliance made him irreplaceable in a fix. It’s no wonder Baker would later actually PLAY Holmes…but that’s another story.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nWhile Tom Baker’s costume would go through some color changes throughout his era, the basic look remains the same from start to finish. Again, much like the Second Doctor, his runabout personality is plainly on display, as his costume looks slapped together and barely adheres to the basic laws of sartorial savoir faire. However, unlike the Second Doctor, there is absolutely nothing here, really, to suggest much similarity to his predecessor: this Doctor is a whole new ball game, plain and simple. His garments ride a fine line between sloppy and sophisticated; the huge coat and overblown scarf never seem to slow him down as he leapfrogs from moment to moment, and while he’s not as action-ready as his predecessor, he’s still quite active physically.\n\nFun fact: the giant scarf was sort of an accident. Apparently, it was commissioned privately by one of the show’s creators, but there was a miscommunication: the woman who made it was brought a VERY large amount of wool, and ended up using ALL of it to create that monstrosity. The scarf was kept because it was just so bizarre, and because it actually ended up being quite useful: the garment is often used as a tool by the Doctor in multiple ways. His floppy hat taking its place upon his head off-and-on throughout his run, he strides through scenes with confidence. It’s a costume that speaks perfectly to his character: a bizarre adventurer with a brilliant brain.\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nAs the longest lasting Doctor, Tom Baker had more companions than any other. The first major two were Harry Sullivan (who I personally like, but not many others seem to) and Sarah Jane Smith, both residents of UNIT. Sarah Jane ended up becoming the single most popular companion in Doctor Who history; she even ended up getting not one, but TWO spinoff shows in her honor. It’s hard to describe what’s so great about Sarah Jane; she’s one of my favorites, but she’s one of those characters where what makes her so beloved is difficult to grasp. I think in many ways she was just the perfect traveling companion for the Fourth Doctor, in particular: there was a childishness to her, and a sense of real kinship with the Fourth Doctor. They felt almost like siblings to each other, and the moment where Sarah Jane left the series was arguably the first tearjerker Companion Departure in the entire show. She was often more capable than people gave her credit, and was just as funny as Baker was. After Sarah and Harry left, the Doctor picked up another pair. One was Leela, whom I personally feel is one of the most underrated Companions of the show: a savage warrior from a race of primitive humans encountered in “Face of Evil,” who joined the Doctor out of a desire to learn more about the universe and how it works. Shortly thereafter came K-9: this was a character people still either seem to love or hate. Personally, I love him: a robot dog who became the one and only pet the Doctor truly had. A fellow Time Lord (or, rather, Time Lady), Romana, was next to join in; she was first played by Mary Tamm, but really hit her stride when played by her second performer, Lalla Ward. Every single one of these characters were great, and it was wonderful to see how the Fourth Doctor’s relationship(s) with each one would work and develop, since no two were ever properly alike. The Fourth Doctor did have still more companions…but just like with Sarah Jane in the previous post, I’m saving them for later. Again, this is for the NOTABLE ones; the ones who I feel are most worth pointing out for anyone interested in looking up the show, and who I felt best complimented their respective Doctors. Up until arguably the last season, the Doctor never really had any bad companions in this era, and with seven seasons and, fittingly, seven years to worry about, that’s quite impressive.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nIt was actually REALLY hard to decide on one solid episode for the Fourth Doctor’s era. There are LOTS of great episodes and great showcases for Tom Baker’s take on the character throughout his era, as you would expect, given his longevity and iconic status in pop culture. This is the last time for a few Doctors where my recommended choice will be my favorite episode of the era, and I sort of chose it mostly just by default: since I really couldn’t decide properly, I figured this would just be the most obvious pick. That episode is “Genesis of the Daleks”: a serial widely regarded as one of the best and most influential in the series’ run. In this episode, we learn the origins of the Daleks, as the Doctor is sent by the Time Lords to the evil race’s homeworld, Skaro, in a time shortly before the Daleks were created. The Time Lords have foreseen that the Daleks could become embittered in a war with their race (this would prove prophetic MANY years later), and the Doctor’s job is to prevent this war from happening by making sure the Daleks never come to be. The episode also introduced a new major villain in the series, Davros: the mad cyborg scientist who created the Daleks in the first place. Originally intended as a oneshot character, after this, Davros would appear in ALL subsequent Dalek stories until the end of the Classic Era, and has made a couple of appearances since in the “New Who” era of the modern day. As far as the Doctor goes, it’s a good showcase of the deeper, darker, and softer sides of the Fourth Doctor’s personality, while still having plenty of room for his usual wit and humor.\n\nNext time, we’ll discuss Peter Davison, the Fifth Doctor: The Lord of Salad Dressing.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR! Welcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! For the next thirteen days, starting now, I’ll be talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nAnd today, we begin the event by talking about The One Who Started It All: William Hartnell, as The First Doctor.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nHartnell’s Doctor is a walking paradox, in retrospect: being the first, he is the youngest of the thirteen “canon” incarnations. Ironically, however, he looks and behaves like the oldest. Of course, this is because the character of the Doctor was thought up long before the concept of Regeneration came around: when the show first came on, there wasn’t any plan for Hartnell to be “the first,” he simply was “The Doctor,” period. I think the First Doctor is particularly interesting in hindsight because he is so radically different from other Doctors who came after him: for one thing, Hartnell’s Doctor, for a while, wasn’t even the main character of the series. The real stars of the show were his Companions; the Doctor was initially imagined as a sort of Willy Wonka or Doc Brown type figure. He was fascinating, but he wasn’t the focus. As the series went on, however, it became clear that the Doctor was the most interesting and dynamic character of the whole group, and so while companions came and went, Hartnell’s character stayed a constant, and took on a larger and larger role in stories right up till the end of his run. As the first, he is also arguably the most important Doctor: without him, the rest would likely not exist. It is for this reason that, unlike other Doctors in the series, this one still made appearances even after his primary actor’s death: in “The Five Doctors,” actor Richard Hurndall took over the part, and more recently in “Twice Upon a Time,” he was played by David Bradley, who previously played Hartnell himself in the TV movie about the beginnings of Doctor Who, “An Adventure in Time and Space.” Other actors would get replacement performers for the Audio Plays I mentioned in my previous post, but Hartnell, to my knowledge, is the only one to have replacement actors in the TV series proper.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nHartnell’s Doctor is, to be blunt, a cranky old man. Again, you’d never guess in retrospect that this was the youngest version of the character. He’s crotchety, temperamental, dictatorial, snappy, and while every version of the Doctor has an ego, his is one of the biggest. At times, he can be almost villainous; in the early days of the show, in particular, he’s often the most antagonistic member of the TARDIS team - a far cry from the alien-busting leader we know today. He’s only in charge in the sense that he’s the only one who can fly the ship. As Hartnell’s era went on, the Doctor softened up as a character: while he remained grouchy and haughty, he became much less nasty. He came to care about his Companions more, and became less interested in merely traveling and more interested in tackling the evil he encountered with direct force. In other words, he started to become more like The Doctor we all know and love. Hurndall and Bradley, in their outings, both do a good job at taking on Hartnell’s mannerisms and general concepts, while also making them their own. Hurndall’s Doctor I feel comes across as a bit more sly and sneaky: he’s more in line with the sort of trickster figure the Doctor would later become than Hartnell himself often is. As for Bradley, he actually does do a good job at making one remember that this Doctor is the youngest: as old as the actor is and the character looks, there’s a sort of smugness and naivete to him that reminds you this is effectively the Doctor in his infancy.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nWhile many things about Hartnell’s era are drastically different from the show we know today, one thing that you can definitely say started with Hartnell and did not really change was the Doctor’s frequently unusual sartorial sense. The costumes of the Doctors are just as big a part of the characters as anything else, and the First Doctor sets the standard right away. Keep in mind, when we first meet the Doctor, it’s in then-modern-day England. The Time Lord is a walking anachronism: dressed in period costume of the Edwardian era, Hartnell’s Doctor is a stuffy, stiff-backed gentleman. He stands out in a crowd almost regardless of where the heroes go, and in the 60s era of the show’s beginning, he has a sort of uncanny dress code: he’s strange enough to be peculiar, but not so totally alien that the heroes take note of the clothes much. He’s an odd authoritarian figure; he likes to seem in charge and affluent, putting on the airs of an old academic on vacation.\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nThe First Doctor had numerous companions over the course of his time in the TARDIS, but for my money, the most interesting ones are the ones he had the longest, and who were also the first companions he had aboard his time-and-spacecraft: Ian Chesterton (a schoolteacher), Barbara Wright (his colleague), and the Doctor’s own granddaughter, Susan. As I said before, in the early days of the show, these three were really the main characters: the stories tended to revolve more around them, with Ian as the tough and charismatic hero, Barbara as his most trusted confidante, and Susan as an unusually brainy “damsel in distress,” with the Doctor really taking fourth place as the eccentric “Grumpy Dwarf” type: the voice of eternal cynicism. As the series went on, the three would become less and less important in the grand scheme of things, and ultimately all three would leave the TARDIS while the Doctor remained to continue adventuring, thus taking his role as the true star of the show. It’s the radically different dynamic from future Companions that makes these three so particularly intriguing to watch; Susan, in particular, remains a fascinating character, simply because of her familial ties to the Doctor. It’s telling that years later, when “The Five Doctors” came out, she was the companion chosen for the reunion special from the First Doctor’s era, and it’s equally telling that vague references to her have continually been made throughout the canon of Doctor Who, whereas I tend to find fewer people remember Ian and Barbara.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nBefore I state which serial I felt best to recommend here, I need to make something clear: “Recommended Viewing” is not the same as saying “My Favorite Episode.” That IS the case HERE, I should add, and there will be some other cases where the two are the same…but that won’t be the case with EVERY Doctor, so just keep that in mind. What I’m really looking for is an episode that I feel is important: if you’re only going to watch ONE episode/serial from that Doctor’s era, and no others, these are the episodes I recommend.\n\nWith that said: for the First Doctor, I recommend “The Daleks.” This was the second serial of the entire series, and the one that first introduced one of the major villains of the show, the titular Daleks. Honestly, I think the collective facts there - that it is so early in the program’s history, introduces such major characters, and is my personal favorite First Doctor episode - make for all the reasons I need to recommend it. I would also like to make additional recommendations for “The Five Doctors” and “Twice Upon a Time,” just for the sake of allowing Richard Hurndall and Peter Bradley some credit for their stellar work following in Hartnell’s wide footsteps.\n\nNext time, we focus on Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor: The Cosmic Hobo.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nWe’ve gone past the halfway point! Today, we’ll be discussing that One Hit Wonder, Paul McGann: the Eighth Doctor!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn the mid-90s, an attempt was made to bring Doctor Who - which had been dormant for approximately seven years since 1989 - back to television. The BBC decided to start this bold attempt with a television movie, which would sort of act as a pilot for the series (not an unusual strategy), and then produce the series after…presuming the film did well. Much of the funding for the production came from American backers, and unfortunately, that would mean the success or failure of the movie - and thus the potential for a series revival - would rest almost entirely on how well the film did in the United States.\n\nWell, unfortunately, the TV film did NOT do well in the U.S.A., and while it was better received in the UK, at least in terms of ratings and returns, it never really found a solid audience anywhere. As a result, the revival concept was scrapped; it would be almost ten years before the show ACTUALLY came back to the small screen. As far as the film goes, it was, and still is, somewhat controversial. The general consensus seems to be that the film is “meh.” I don’t know too many people, personally, who revile it…but I also don’t know too many people who love it, either. I won’t go into all the ups and downs of the film itself, though. I’m here to focus specifically on its main character: Paul McGann as the 8th Doctor.\n\nRight alongside Colin Baker, McGann is one of the most underappreciated Doctors, and I think that stems mostly from the fact that he only has two screen appearances to his name: one is the TV movie, which again is “meh,” and the other is a “mini-episode” entitled “Night of the Doctor,” which shows how McGann’s character transformed into the lore-headache-inducing character of “The War Doctor.” (Again, the War Doctor will NOT be covered in this retrospective.) McGann would later have greater life in the Big Finish audio plays, as well as various novels and comics, but in terms of onscreen appearances, these two performances are all we’ve ever gotten.\n\nNow…before I get into McGann himself, and what makes his Doctor what he is…the time has come to properly address the issue of the Big Finish audio plays, in particular. As I’ve said multiple times by now, I am NOT including them in my evaluation of each Doctor and their strengths and weaknesses. This is for two reasons. One, I haven’t heard very many of them, and while I have generally liked what I HAVE heard, it’s hard for me to judge properly with that in mind. Two, the canon of the audio plays is…fluctuating. Several productions very clearly are meant to be canon with the TV series, but they are never properly referenced or have their placement made apparent IN the TV series, making it harder to gather where they fit into the sprawling, deranged timeline of the show…and some, just as clearly, are not likely canon at all. These two basic issues are the same reasons why I’m not including novels, comics, or anything of that nature here, either…but there’s a third reason I need to address, because I feel it’s important.\n\nDoctor Who is a series that, barring a couple of hiatuses, has been going on for nearly sixty years now. NEARLY. SIXTY. YEARS. And it has gone on for approximately NINE HUNDRED separate episodes (less if you count the serials and such all in one go, but that still leads to about…two to three hundred stories, I think). If you discount the hiatuses, that’s still about 40 years on TV. Why do I say this? Because, frankly, I don’t think there’s any EXCUSE for there to be underdevelopment with something that long-running and that gigantic. I shouldn’t HAVE to listen to audio plays or watch spin-off shows or do any of that sort of thing to get what makes the characters work or see what makes them so brilliant. Doctor Who is a TELEVISION staple, first and foremost, and it has been that way for AGES. No matter how many audio plays or such there are, that’s not going to change. If the TV show can’t give me what it needs to, then that is the fault of the production, NOT the Doctor…but that also means that any undervelopment that exists has to be taken bitterly. It’s sort of the same reason the expanded universe for Star Wars or Star Trek is so iffy, but at least with the former, that’s been going on for less time and over a series of movies, which - even when taken together - do not equate to the amount of screentime a giant mega TV series would contain. With something like Doctor Who? It should stand on its own two feet, and so should every Doctor in it. The canon of the TV show, so far, seems to be inarguable, and that is ultimately where what works or doesn’t work should be most keenly focused on. Keeping that in mind…let’s look at the one hit wonder that is Paul McGann’s Doctor.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nAlongside the Fifth Doctor, Paul McGann’s Eighth Doctor is generally considered to be the most “human.” In fact, in the movie, it’s stated that the Doctor actually has human blood in his veins, although I believe that fact was later retconned. (Thank goodness for that, because while it would explain why the Doctor seems to love the human race so much, it doesn’t really do anything for the character, mucks up the lore up to that point, and generally doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.) In a less literal sense, however, McGann’s Doctor is something of an amalgamation of the Third, Fourth, Fifth Doctors: his love of Jelly Babies, motormouth excitability, and love of name-dropping historical figures and rambling about his experiences with them are reminiscent of Tom Baker, while his more action-ready elements are certainly similar to Jon Pertwee’s Bond-esque exploits. However, what stands out the most about McGann’s Doctor are his youthful, dashing good looks, and his sense of intense compassion, which are clear carry-overs from Peter Davison. This Doctor is one who tries to reason with his enemies, who will sacrifice himself before anybody else, and in direct contrast to the plots and schemes of his previous incarnation, seems a bit more naive and tender-hearted. It’s as if he’s trying to right the wrongs of who he used to be: a man who has given up on the dark and enigmatic persona he held before, and simply presents himself as who he is, wearing his heart on his sleeve - a trait that is often a weakness just as much as a strength, as it gets him into trouble just as often as it shows his real power. Indeed, it is his compassion that ironically leads to his downfall and need to become the War Doctor: a recognition that he can’t save everyone, and that he needs to harden himself in order to become the man he needs to be for the trials ahead. In a way, this is a Doctor tormented by his own name: he wants so badly to be the man who fixes everything, who saves everyone, and it’s telling that when he has his great transformation, he doesn’t like to be CALLED “Doctor” anymore. There’s a sort of heartwarming tragedy to the Eighth Doctor: the Time Lord who perhaps cares too much, even through his distracted rambling.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nOnce again, the Eighth Doctor is a walking anachronism. While other Doctors had clothes that leaned towards the Edwardian or Victorian, the Eighth straight up dresses in a costume that resembles Lewis Carroll in his first appearance. (I don’t know if that specific analogy was intended, but if you look at photos of Carroll, and then pictures of the Eighth Doctor, trust me, you’ll see a resemblance: https://www.ersilias.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Lewis-Carroll-y-Charles-Lutwidge-Dodgson-6-1856-60.jpg.) Another, perhaps even more apt comparison to make is Jules Verne’s classic sci-fi novel “The Time Machine,” where its main character is often shown to also wear such types of clothing in illustrated versions. Once again, the anachronistic style serves to give the Doctor his usual eccentric code of dress, but it also serves to give him a sense of sophistication and a bold, dignified demeanor: McGann is a handsome fellow in that smooth green frock coat, and it once again serves to contrast him from the Seventh Doctor’s more “mad professor” demeanor. This is a slick, smooth, gentlemanly Doctor: more mellow than the last, but still strange in nearly any environment. By the time we meet McGann again in “Night of the Doctor,” he still bears hallmarks of that early appearance, but we can clearly tell this is not the same man who beat Eric Roberts - I mean, the Master - all those uncountable years ago. It’s a bit like the contrast between William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton: retaining some of the same elements, but making them look more battered and disheveled. However, instead of being used to contrast two different regenerations, this happens within the SAME regeneration, and instead of being played for laughs, it shows us just how much has changed for the Eighth Doctor: the first is a man entering the world fresh-faced, born again and ready to see the world with a new outlook. The other is a man whose dreams have been blown apart, still desperately clutching to the ideals of his youth; a man who has been through Hell, and is just clinging to the light in the dark for as long as he can.\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nAs I said before, I’m not counting the “expanded material,” so in terms of companions, the Eighth Doctor really only has two…and they don’t even technically count as companions. One is Chang Lee: a young street thug who is actually partially responsible for the Seventh Doctor’s death…and then robs his corpse…and is fooled by the Master into helping him with his evil plan. (pauses) Yeaaaaahhhh…I don’t like Chang Lee much. I mean, good on the kid for eventually seeing the light and becoming a hero in the end (and I should add that his actor, Yee Jee Tso, does a GREAT job), but…nope. That’s like running over my dog and taking him to the hospital…only to then chop off his tail, and then help someone else frame a man for the crime. Sorry, hard for me to come back from that. The other is Grace Holloway: a surgeon who is also partially responsible for the Seventh Doctor’s death (I’m sensing a pattern here, and I don’t like it), and ends up joining the Eighth Doctor on his journey, and even starts to fall in love with him. In fact, the romantic undertones with Grace were something controversial at the time: up to that point, the Doctor was generally seen as an asexual being, and any romantic interest he may or may not have had in his companions was simply implied…but with Grace, the romance is real and direct, with the Doctor sharing his first kiss. Nowadays, no one bats an eye at the moment, since the modern Doctors tend to be more sexually and romantically active, but back then, fans were very split about it, as you can imagine. Anyway, Daphne Ashbrook does a fine job (seriously, all the acting in this TV Movie is great…well…maybe ALMOST all the acting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKuGBYpP3Y), and Grace is a good character - and so is Chang Lee, despite my annoyance with him - but since the movie ends with the three characters going their separate ways, I don’t know how much they actually count as “Companions.” McGann would get ACTUAL Companions in his audio plays, but again, I’m not counting any of those here. On THAT note…\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nAs I said, the TV Movie and “Night of the Doctor” are the only televised appearances McGann has. And while the former is imperfect, and the latter is only a mini-episode (you can find it on YouTube, in fact), they’re both obviously must-sees: they’re the only way you’ll get to know McGann’s Doctor outside of supplementary material. Bearing that in mind…for all my talk about discounting the audio dramas, I’m going to throw them a bone in THIS case, because truly, the BEST McGann stories are those in said audio plays. My recommended LISTENING, therefore, is “Terror Firma”: my favorite McGann Doctor audio play (though, again, I haven’t necessarily heard very many), and one of the absolute best stories of ANYTHING in Doctor Who to feature the villainous Davros. If you skip that though, the TV Movie and Mini-Episode remain must-sees, so check them both out: for all their flaws, they are necessary, in my books.\n\nIt’s time to move into the New Who Era! Next time we’ll be discussing Christopher Eccleston, the Ninth Doctor: My First Doctor.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we talk about that Madman in a Box, Matt Smith, as the Eleventh Doctor!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI’ve used the phrase “Madman in a Box” to describe the Doctor several times. This is an apt description, but the phrase itself is actually pretty recent: it started with this Doctor, the Eleventh. While the Eleventh Doctor doesn’t seem to be AS popular as David Tennant or Tom Baker yet, I would argue he’s probably a close third behind them in terms of fan attention. My guess is that, again, this is because he’s more recent than a lot of the Classic Doctors, so more young people are liable to know him more easily, and by that same token he’s likely the Doctor most people of the current fandom generation have grown up with most fondly. Again, I suspect that, in a few years, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker will start seeing an uptick in popularity, as well. Interestingly, while Tennant seems to be the Doctor most people identify, so to speak, I think Smith’s is the Doctor people tend to QUOTE the most: lots of phrases, speeches, and so on throughout his series run are still considered to be among the most important “symbols” in the fandom, so it’s sort of an odd recognition there.\n\nSmith was the youngest person to take the role of the Doctor since Peter Davison; Davison had been 29 at the time he took on the role, whereas Smith was actually younger than me as I type this: 26. (Proof that I’m never going to make it big in the world…wow, I just made myself depressingly sad, MOVING ON.) His youth, once again, does not even remotely hinder his power in the role; the actor brought a new, fresh kind of intensity to the part, which many would argue is an equal match to Tennant’s portrayal of the Time Lord, while having a wholly original approach to the character. Stepping into the role after such a seemingly instantly iconic Doctor just left had to be a major challenge, but Smith stepped up to the plate with gusto, and thus was lifted from obscurity to travel through time and space.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nIn my humble opinion, the Eleventh Doctor may be the single most ALIEN Doctor of the lot. Something about the way he’s costumed and made up, the way he moves and emphasizes certain words, and even just the oddball elements of his personality all really work to remind the viewers this is NOT a human being we’re dealing with, no matter how similar to a man he may look. Just like Peter Davison, he plays the Doctor as an old man in a younger man’s body. There’s a sort of persnickety element to his character, both scatterbrained and fastidious, that sort of reminds you of a dotty old grandfather, which you wouldn’t expect from a Doctor who looks (and, in reality for the actor, is) so youthful and vivacious.\n\nIn fact, the Eleventh Doctor is alarming in that he can be both so old and so very young at the same time. While others before him acted a wee bit childish, he often outright IS a child, in many ways: excitable, eager to learn, always poking and prodding and fussing about, questioning everything and frequently going into rambling, swift-paced mutterings as he tries to puzzle out the universe around him. But then he can flip on a dime, and suddenly become a powerful, dangerous creature, all that fidgeting and fluttering vanishing as his voice becomes methodical, slow, calculating. His expressions go very hollow, as his whole demeanor becomes still and downright predatory. There’s a reason the phrase “Madman in a Box” came up with this Doctor: other Doctors were a little bit bonkers, but this Doctor had a running theme of his sanity CONSTANTLY being questioned. Everyone seemed to know he wasn’t completely right in the head, including him, but when the chips were down, this absolute maniac was the only person who knew the answers to the problems. As a result of all this, I honestly think the Eleventh Doctor became both the funniest AND the scariest take on the Doctor, at least in my opinion. There was never any doubt he was the hero, but he was a very RUTHLESS hero.\n\nSomething I only noted at the last minute - like, only a short while before posting all this - was that there’s an interesting story arc that occurs with the first three Doctors of the New Who era. The Ninth Doctor starts off his run as a man willing to die alone and unloved if it means he can save the world, and who quickly and readily accepts his end when it happens without much self-reflection, still hurt but starting to heal. The Tenth Doctor is a man who, in seeking purpose in his life, ends up getting too full of himself…but at the same time, he finds that self-esteem he was lacking: in the end, he realizes all the good he could still do, and doesn’t want to fade away. And with the Eleventh Doctor, we have a young man who, in his first adventure, displays remarkable confidence and power, but who tries constantly to push away his faults…and when his time to leave the TARDIS comes, he accepts death with a smile, and promises to never forget a thing, simply happy that he could do everything he did, and sentimental about his time. He has no regrets anymore, at least none that matter in his final moments, whereas the other two were filled with pain of some kind or another. It’s interesting to see the Doctor cope and mature in this way, when you look at the broader spectrum of these three regenerations.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nSmith’s costume changes a few times during his run. The actor credited Patrick Troughton as a major influence on his portrayal and appearance. His first look (and my personal favorite) is one where his inspiration from the Second Doctor is most prominent, and it really shows the kind of person this Doctor will be. His bow tie and red suspenders give him a “geeky” demeanor, but there’s a sleekness and a slickness to his look. He can command authority just as easily as he can dart about jabbing at every space in a place; he can charismatically lead just as much as he can banter and giggle. As the show went on, the Doctor’s look would change: first, he would replace his brown blazer with a green trenchcoat for a brief time, then, more noticeably, in his final season, he would adopt a Victorian garb, with a purple frock coat and trousers. The final costume was an unusual sign of character development: not so much based on the Doctor’s mood, so much as his location. In the final season of Smith’s era, the Doctor had decided to retire, and had taken up residence in Victorian England. The style, of course, reflects this element of the storytelling, while the darker, richer colors definitely point to the Doctor’s dour mood at the start of this point in his run. The bow tie would remain regardless, through every alteration; it became something of an icon from the character, in the same way Tom Baker’s scarf or Davison’s decorative celery are icons for theirs. Indeed, it’s telling that when Smith’s Doctor departs, his final act is to remove his bow tie.\n\nCOMPANIONS\n\nUnlike the previous Doctor, who “adopted” companions from his earlier incarnation, Eleven starts off his run with a whole new set of characters. His chief two companions were a husband and wife duo, Amy and Rory Pond. Amy, in many ways, becomes instrumental in this Doctor’s lifetime: she is the first person he meets, and she helps him get an understanding of the world; as a result, it feels like he’s returning the favor as he takes her off on a mad journey through the cosmos. There’s a great deal of rivalry, meanwhile, between Rory and the Doctor. Some have compared this particular trio to the Fourth Doctor with Sarah Jane and Harry, except perhaps much better done, as Rory is a generally more interesting and developed character than Harry, and there’s additional tension with the Ponds being married. In fact, I think this was the first time we had a married couple aboard the TARDIS. We’d had characters with romantic interest in each other before, but never any who were actively a couple. The ultimately bitter departure of the Ponds throws the Eleventh Doctor into a spiraling state of hopelessness; fed up with his many failures in life, he names them the last straw, and thus tries to retire.\n\nThis leads into the character of Clara Oswald: a woman whom the Doctor meets a couple different iterations of throughout history and space, before finding out the riddle of how he keeps meeting her in so many places and time periods. I’ve always had mixed feelings about Clara, and in regards to the Eleventh Doctor, I think my issue is that, much like Rose with the Tenth, they seemed to try and make her more special than she really was: the “Impossible Child” concept was interesting, but I don’t think it was executed very well. However, some of my favorite episodes of the Eleventh Doctor’s era come in the final season with Clara, so I can’t act like she didn’t have her shining moments. As for Clara with the Twelfth Doctor…we’ll get to that another time.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nWith some of these, such as the previous Doctor, choosing an episode to recommend is extraordinarily difficult. With others, it’s much easier. This one was the single easiest out of all the Doctors. Why? Because the Eleventh Doctor is the MC of MY ALL TIME FAVORITE DOCTOR WHO EPISODE EVER. That episode is entitled “The Doctor’s Wife.” It is a FANTASTIC episode; somewhere between a dark fairy-tale and a high-concept sci-fi horror story, but despite its darker elements, it also has the trademark sense of humor we’ve come to know and love. It has an excellent villain, and also some amazing major character moments - especially from the Eleventh Doctor himself, showing his humor, his vulnerability, and even his elements of menace to a perfect degree. And the topper of all this? It’s written by Neil Gaiman. Yes, fans of Coraline, Sandman, Teknophage, and American Gods: THAT Neil Gaiman, who it turns out is a major Doctor Who fan. This, so far, is one of only two times Gaiman has written for the show; the other was another Eleventh Doctor episode entitled “Nightmare in Silver,” which fans seem…mixed on. I personally think it’s okay, but this one tops it by a grand margin.\n\nOnly two Doctors remain! Tomorrow, we’ll talk about Peter Capaldi, the Twelfth Doctor: the embodiment of Old Meets New.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nThis is our penultimate entry! Today we discuss the Doctor I like to consider as the embodiment of Old Meets New. This is Peter Capaldi, the Twelfth Doctor.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFun Fact: Peter Capaldi is one of two actors to play the Doctor who first appeared in an unrelated role earlier in the show. Colin Baker originally appeared on Doctor Who as a corrupt Time Lord soldier in “Arc of Infinity,” a Fifth Doctor story, before eventually being picked to play Peter Davison’s replacement as the Sixth Doctor. Capaldi, meanwhile, initially appeared in the Tenth Doctor story “Fires of Pompeii” as a citizen of the titular doomed city, before being chosen a few years later to play the Twelfth Doctor. Other future Doctors appeared in past roles related to the series, but so far as I know, they are the only two who appeared in two different roles within the primary show before gaining the mantle of Time’s Champion.\n\nCapaldi’s casting was quite a stir for modern Doctor Who fans. My comment on “Old Meets New” is apt because the idea with the Twelfth Doctor seemed to be an attempt to blend elements of the Classic era with the style and substance of the Modern era. Several things in Capaldi’s interpretation are heavily influenced by the Classic show - perhaps more than any Doctor before him in the New Who series - but there are also a lot of things (and not just aesthetically) that are clearly trademarks of the modern day. At first, I felt this blend was a bit off; it took me a little while to really warm up to Capaldi. I think it wasn’t until the end of his first season that I REALLY started to get into his interpretation of the Doctor. However, from that point on, the character took off and didn’t stop running. I’ve heard that apparently fans had mixed emotions about Capaldi’s time in the show, but one thing I will always defend is that he gave us a truly brilliant portrayal of the character, and never once phoned in a performance.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor is, of course, older than any of the earlier Doctors since Paul McGann; in fact, his intense age is highly ironic, since his predecessor, Matt Smith, was and currently still is the youngest person to take on the role at the time. Having said that, not only is his age quite an opposite direction, but so is the way the character plays with it. The Eleventh Doctor, like the Fifth, was something of an old soul; an aging wizard locked in the body of a nutty child. The Twelfth Doctor takes things in the exact opposite direction: he’s more like a wild child in a older man’s body. In fact, as his seasons would go on, this element would be played with more and more, and was especially emphasized in his final episode, where he actually teamed up with the First Doctor (played by David Bradley). Indeed, a running gag had him being in denial about how old he really seemed to be; always getting petulant over the matter. He was basically the “Hello Fellow Kids” Doctor, in short: wanting to seem more virile and vivacious than he really was.\n\nCapaldi’s Doctor is another paradox in terms: he isn’t as overtly menacing as Tennant or Smith, but instead, he’s far more detached emotionally. He even says of a companion in one episode, “She’s my carer: she cares so I don’t have to.” The Twelfth Doctor was acidic and sarcastic, prone to angry outbursts and easily driven to confrontation. He kept his emotions close to his chest, and did the same with his cards, not always straightforward with his plans or his goals, often to his companions’ frustration. He could, at times, even seem downright mean or callous: he would sacrifice lives and manipulate people to his own ends, without hesitation.\n\nUnderneath all this, however, was something that I think made the Twelfth Doctor much more inherently likable: his ironic kindness. This Doctor could seem cold at times, but you always knew that he was just burying his own pain. This is a Time Lord who has learned that crying won’t solve anything: sometimes, you have to buckle down and just keep moving on and fighting, no matter what happens. He would give his enemies many chances before taking them down, but when he did take them down, he would be ruthless. In direct contrast, he was remarkably forgiving to his friends; even when they did something that ruined everything he had in mind, he wouldn’t stop caring for them or abandon them. In short, this Doctor was probably one of the most compassionate and caring, but he didn’t always SEEM like it; he stood for no nonsense, but he would listen to reason and always try to help. Under the brusque and petulant demeanor, there was a true gentleman, and a secret optimist under the cynical wit.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nIn terms of costume, many people have compared the Twelfth Doctor’s garments to Jon Pertwee. His first costume, in fact, was directly inspired by a Third Doctor outfit, so this is fair; also, much like Pertwee, this Doctor actually didn’t HAVE one set costume. Over the course of his three seasons, Capaldi wears a number of different outfits, and his overall appearance changes in various ways throughout the course of his adventures. There’s something of an evolution to his costumes, too. In the first season, he seems generally more well put-together, his hair neater and his costumes more strict and flashy. In his second season, he tends to wear more modern clothes, and his overall appearance is often a bit less tidy. And then, in his third season, he wears clothes that are once again more “classical” in appearance, but usually not as restrained as his first series outfits; indeed, his final look sums it all up, being similar to his first, but now much looser and more distressed. Much like McGann, the different outfits all tell a running narrative: a man who starts off ready to face the world and put on a show, then decides to try and fade into it and blend in a bit more…before finally giving up on his demeanor entirely, as he becomes more interested in the work he has to do.\n\nCOMPANIONS\n\nThe Twelfth Doctor’s first two seasons featured Clara Oswald, adopted from the Eleventh Doctor. In some ways, I think their relationship was better than when Clara was with the Eleventh, but in other ways, I think it was worse. With the Eleventh Doctor, you had to deal with that annoying “Timeless Child” business; true, that still had to be taken into account here, but it was never really brought up, and it didn’t affect the storytelling much at all. Clara and Twelve also had brilliant chemistry, bouncing off one another beautifully in all sorts of delightful ways. On the other hand, their closeness was far more sporadic: I frankly got annoyed at how often Clara would “leave” the Doctor, or how often he would leave her, only for them to reunite immediately after. Eventually, Clara DID leave for good, and in Capaldi’s last season, he gained two new companions: first came Nardole, a humanoid alien, not unlike the Doctor (the first alien companion since the Classic era, in fact), played by the incomparable Matt Lucas. Second came Bill Potts, the show’s first openly homosexual companion: a young lady who actually reminds me a lot of Ace, being a battle-ready, somewhat tomboyish type.\n\nWhat I find most fascinating about all three of the Twelfth Doctor’s companions, and one of the things that feels most “Classic” about this interpretation, is his relationships with them. Between the 8th and the 11th Doctors, ALL of them had onscreen companions that they ended up in a romantic or pseudo-romantic relationship with. With all three of Twelve’s companions, there is little to no romantic interest. With Clara, the Twelfth Doctor states outright in his first appearance that he’s “not her boyfriend,” and their relationship becomes something more like best friends, with arguable hints at a father/daughter dynamic. Indeed, Clara seems to be learning in her era how to BECOME the Doctor; almost as if he’s teaching her how to take over the reins for him someday. With Nardole, the Doctor acts as something of a commanding officer, with Nardole as his comedic and at times begrudging second-in-command. The two have an almost brotherly relationship, but not one of blood; Nardole is lower in “rank” to the Doctor, but the Doctor never treats him as a pet or a servant. As for Bill…once again, in a manner that reminds me of Ace with Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor flat-out refers to himself as her “teacher,” and that tells you everything right there. Most of the Classic Doctors looked to their companions as friends, colleagues, students, or surrogate children (and, in one case, literally their granddaughter), and Capaldi’s companions seem to fit into those same veins.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nOnce again, this was a tough one to choose, and I had to wrestle for a while with which one I’d pick. There were basically three key episodes - all of which were two-parters - that I had to try and decide between. Ultimately, I went with “The Magician’s Apprentice/The Witch’s Familiar.” It’s not my favorite episode of Capaldi’s run (that goes to the penultimate two-parter of this era, “World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls”), but it is, again, probably the most definitive. It features Davros (in, at least to date, his final appearance so far), Clara sort of “in-training,” and it’s a great showcase for Missy: a female take on the Master who basically became a series regular during Capaldi’s time. It’s also brilliant for showcasing that “Hello Fellow Kids” angle with this Doctor: ever wanted to see the Doctor wear sunglasses and a hoodie while playing electric guitar? Here’s the episode for you!\n\nTomorrow, we’ll be talking about the Final Doctor to Date: Jodie Whittaker, as the Thirteenth Doctor. “The Timeless Child.”\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we’ll be discussing arguably the Most Underappreciated Time Lord of All. This is the Sixth Doctor, Colin Baker!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEarlier on, when I announced this event, I stated that I would ONLY be counting the TV series proper in terms of rating and discussing the different Doctors. The specific reasons why I will get to in a later entry still, but suffice it to say, this is one of two examples where some of the audio plays, in particular, really helped the Doctor along.\n\nColin Baker’s time on the TARDIS was short and…controversial, to say the least. Ol’ C.B., as I like to call him, got the job almost by sheer luck, and was the first (and so far only) Doctor to be FIRED from his job in the role. He was also the first Doctor to truly get the short end of the stick, with only two full seasons to his name: again, most other Doctors got three, and Baker’s two were not the longest seasons, either, when compared to some Doctors both before and since. There were a lot of creative decisions on the show at this time that ended up compromising the program; any issues I and others have with the Doctor and this era are NOT Colin Baker’s fault, and I must stress again that there isn’t a single Doctor I outright dislike. I love them all, I truly do, and C.B. is no exception.\n\nIn many ways, the Sixth Doctor was a risky character to manage: again, there were a lot of creative decisions being made that really changed up the show. The episodes became longer in length, while the serials conversely became shorter in episode number; this made it harder for the writers, who were used to the exact opposite equation, to make the plots work in the typical format. It’s also been suggested that the head of writing at the time, who notoriously did NOT like Colin Baker, deliberately wrote him into bad stories to try and get him booted off the show. I feel that accusation is something of a tin foil hat issue, but what IS well-known is, by the time Davison’s era ended, the BBC heads of staff were starting to think Doctor Who was either in need of a major overhaul, or had to be canceled completely. The Sixth Doctor’s era very nearly led to that cancellation, as the changes it tried just did not work.\n\nI know I’m accentuating on the negative here, but I only do this because I have to say outright…I think Colin Baker may be one of the most underappreciated Doctors of all. I’d be lying if I said I’d rank him very highly, but again, that was NEVER his fault. I love his Doctor, it’s just that the writing and other creative choices did him NO favors in his time. Out of about a dozen stories, there are only two most people agree are really good, two more that I would argue I personally think are worth watching despite their flaws, and after that it’s mostly just crud that maybe has a glimmer of gold in it somewhere…and that glimmer is usually The Doctor. Having gotten all that out of the way…let’s get into the character and era more fully.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nThe Sixth Doctor was, in many ways, the first Doctor since William Hartnell to actually show real development over the course of his time in the show. With only two seasons, the character does noticeably change and in a very interesting way. With the Second, Third, Fourth, AND Fifth Doctors, they are basically the same person immediately before their regeneration as they were when they were first “born.” With the Sixth Doctor, things are different. Much like his predecessor, the Sixth Doctor emerges from his regeneration traumatized…but while the Fifth Doctor recovered quickly, and the side effects were more humorous than horrifying…well…the Sixth Doctor LITERALLY TRIES TO STRANGLE HIS COMPANION within his FIRST 12 MINUTES OF SCREENTIME. Yikes. Needless to say, this was NOT a good start, but while many fans see this as a bad turn, I actually think seeing the Doctor so broken at the start was really interesting; the idea, again, was to go as far from Peter Davison as possible.\n\nAnd far from Davison this Doctor is, indeed; he outright derides his predecessor’s “feckless charm,” and while Davison’s Doctor was compassionate and gentle, Colin Baker’s Doctor is the exact opposite. Bold, melodramatic, and mercurial, he has the single biggest ego of probably ANY of the Doctors. Irrepressibly arrogant, he strides around from scene to scene, always ready to boast or flaunt his superiority; he’s never outright villainous (well…aside from, again, TRYING TO KILL HIS COMPANION, but he recovers from that and regrets it), but he’s definitely not shy, and much less ready to show pity towards his opponents. The development that comes into play, however, is that - much like Hartnell - as C.B.’s stories go on, you do see the supercilious and brash character soften up a bit. He still has that ego, but he takes himself less seriously, and becomes much more friendly and helpful with those who travel with him. It’s truly a shame by the time he leaves, because his Doctor is wonderfully funny and interesting, and could have been so much more with better scripts and more time to play.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nOh, yes…THIS one. For reasons that no one can fathom to this very day, the producer of the show decided that the Sixth Doctor should wear clothing that was, and I quote, “totally tasteless.” Again, one can only assume this was meant to make him stand out from Peter Davison as much as possible: in place of the pale, inviting hues of Davison’s dapper outfit, we have a guy wearing a suit I’m pretty sure even the Mad Hatter wouldn’t be caught dead in. In all fairness, while I find this patchwork abomination to be absolutely INSANE…over time, I’ve come to warm up to it a bit more. I like certain parts of it, I just don’t think it all goes together well. But, once again, in a way, it seems to match this version of the Doctor: this is a character who demands your attention, but doesn’t necessarily care if you LIKE him or not. He just does what he wants to do, and tries his best to make it look good. After hearing from other people and interviews and such, I also think it speaks to the Doctor’s issues in the series, especially in his first couple of stories, where he’s still reeling from his Regeneration and not fully mentally stable. The jigsaw puzzle of eye-burning colors definitely reflects a state of mind that isn’t fully settled. The character would later change his costume in the audio plays…but again, I’m not counting those, and even if I were, they’re AUDIO plays. That’s a little too late when it comes to costume changes. :P\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nUnlike virtually all his predecessors, the Sixth Doctor really only had two noteworthy companions during his run…and I think part of the reason his Doctor couldn’t live up to his fullest potential was because, to be honest, neither of these companions were very good. At least, not on TV; again, the audio plays have helped them a lot, just as they’ve helped C.B. himself, but I’m focusing on the television program here, and there…well, they’re not that great. The first is Peri Brown, who got her start with the Fifth Doctor; in her first appearance in “Planet of Fire,” Peri was a spunky, sparky, smart gal, similar in many ways to Sarah Jane Smith: a damsel in distress who could still somehow hold her own, and even had the guts to sass The Master! Unfortunately, from pretty much her immediate second appearance onward, Peri really, REALLY weakened as a character, becoming little more than a crybaby who always sounded about five seconds away from sobbing uncontrollably. Her relationship with the Sixth Doctor ALMOST worked: it started off VERY rocky, as you can imagine, but as the Doctor mellowed, his relationship with her became closer, and by the time Peri left, she really had become a more interesting character…but it doesn’t excuse all the bad times with her before that point.\n\nHer successor was no better: Mel Bush. Many agree that Mel is one of the worst companions in the show’s history, and I am in that camp. Much like with Colin Baker, I don’t think that’s necessarily HER fault: the writing and directing just didn’t do the actress who played her, Bonnie Langford, any favors. Mel basically comes out of nowhere and proceeds to be a nagging, screaming annoyance from her practically her first minute onward. If the chemistry between C.B. and Peri was strained, there was absolutely nothing there with Mel. Again, both characters are much better in the audio dramas, but I’M. NOT. COUNTING. THEM. Perhaps if the Sixth Doctor had been blessed with better companions and better scripts, his era could have been better and longer…alas, twas not to be. Still, I do appreciate the character a great deal, and I’d be lying if I said both these gals didn’t have a few good moments to their names.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nJust like with Peter Davison, this time I’m recommending my second favorite episode for this era, since I feel my actual favorite episode (“Revelation of the Daleks”) isn’t really the best option to see what makes Baker’s Doctor so particularly great. Instead, I’m going with “Vengeance on Varos” - a very meta story about violence in entertainment, widely regarded alongside “Revelation” as one of arguably only two truly good stories of the Colin Baker era. (I personally also really like “Mark of the Rani,” and I find “The Two Doctors” to be a guilty pleasure, but those are literally another story.) Peri and the Doctor’s relationship here is a bit better than in many other episodes, and it features a great oneshot villain in the form of the vaguely Jabba-the-Hutt esque slug beast, Sil.\n\nNext time, we’ll discuss Sylvester McCoy, the Seventh Doctor: The Chessmaster.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we’ll be discussing the Lord of Salad Dressing himself! This is the Fifth Doctor, Peter Davison!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWhen the Fourth Doctor came onto the scene, he was probably the youngest yet, but he was soon trumped by his own successor: Peter Davison was only 29 when he took on the role of the character, and already had made quite a name for himself on television in other BBC productions. While his tenure of the standard three seasons meant he had much less time to work than Tom Baker’s portrayal, he was, nevertheless, one of the most impactful depictions of the character. This is especially evident in the New Who era, where - out of five Doctors there so far - two are largely inspired by Davison’s portrayal, in particular, and a third has certain little quirks directly tied to him. Three out of five Doctors in the modern times, all paying homage to ONE version in particular? That’s got to count for something.\n\nOnce again, the intention was to go as far from the previous Doctor as possible. Davison’s Fifth Doctor emerges from his regeneration scarred; for almost a full quarter of his debut serial, he is in a state of dissociative identity, switching his personality and mannerisms frequently, adopting phrases and quirks from all four of his earlier incarnations, before - finally - managing to settle in. And once settled in, Davision turns out to be a far cry from Baker’s wild bohemian. He’s still a traveler first and foremost - the Doctor as an outright conqueror of evil, in fact, wouldn’t really become a thing till the next two incarnations - but he treats things with a more casual air. Many people refer to Davison’s turn as the Most Human Doctor: he feels the least alien, the least remote and detached, and with his dashing good looks and commanding, high-flying voice, it’s no wonder so many modern Doctors look to him for inspiration.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nOf all the Classic era Doctors, and arguably all of the Doctors in general, Davison is the most mellow. I wouldn’t call him “serious” in the way Jon Pertwee was, but he’s not as nutty as Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton, or even, to a certain degree, William Hartnell. This is the first Doctor where it’s easy to forget he’s not a human being. He’s a lot less mad, even as a facade; he still has a quirkiness to his personality, but he isn’t a Madman in a Box. He is endlessly compassionate and merciful; more emotionally invested in the people around him than previous Doctors were. He was less childish, as well; in fact, he seemed to go in the complete opposite direction. Davison combats his youthful appearance with a personality that’s a bit more like an eccentric old uncle; despite his almost princely demeanor, you really do feel this is an older gentleman trapped inside a younger man’s body. While he always tries to be nice and is, in his own words, “the most agreeable one,” he still has an ego (all the Doctors do, to some degree or another), and he can be somewhat tetchy at times. Nevertheless, you always know he’ll do the right thing, no matter the cost: even if he doesn’t like you much - in fact, even if he HATES you - he’ll often try to find some way to help you when you need it, or, at the very least, hesitate a great deal when it comes to killing you. In fact, I would argue number five is the single most merciful of all Doctors; at points where other Doctors wouldn’t pause to destroy their foes, he either hesitates or shows intense regret afterwards. This was a Doctor who truly valued ALL life, and seemed to be starting to realize there was more to the universe than simply exploring it. He wanted to UNDERSTAND it, and that sense of understanding was what made him so likeable and fun.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nOnce again, as all the best Doctor outfits do, the costume Davison wears reflects his personality magnificently, and also helps to make him stand out greatly in comparison to whomever came before him. Instead of a loud, slapped-together bohemian adventurer, we have a young man dressed largely in beige and white, with accents of red and orange. The question marks on the collar of his shirt were an idea of the producer’s, first implemented in Tom Baker’s final season; a lot of fans seem to hate them, but I’ve personally never felt any need to complain at all. His panama hat and neat, fluttering coat help him cut a dapper but sporting figure, while the cricketer outfit underneath it - complete with trainer shoes - really does speak of a younger, more physical Doctor: not the sort to pummel his enemies, but the sort who loves a good game. It’s an inviting, mellow figure…but still eccentric in its own way. The most glaring part of the outfit, of course, is the stick of celery in his lapel; that one item - which, ironically, is revealed to have a practical function in Davison’s final serial - says it all: an otherwise normal man who just happens to have a small spark of something weird and seemingly inexplicable in him; that inner alien that can never be fully suppressed.\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nDavison’s TARDIS crew once again started off with a whole gaggle of companions “inherited” from the Fourth Doctor. This proved to be both an interesting addition and a bit of a problem, at the same time. On the one hand, it was hard to make sure every separate character got their due at the start…but on the other hand, the result was that you almost had a sort of family aboard the TARDIS for a time, traveling the stars together. Overall, the Fifth Doctor wound up having almost as many companions as the Fourth, and in less than half the amount of time. The crew started out with Tegan Jovanka; an opinionated airline attendant who sort of got roped into things; Nyssa, the last survivor of the world of Traken, who seemed to look up to the Doctor as something of a big brother figure after he saved her and took her with him on his adventures; and then there was Adric, a boy genius who I can only describe as the Jason Todd of the Doctor Who universe. One by one, these companions would disappear, and other companions - most notably Vislor Turlough, an assassin who joined the Doctor first as a double-agent, then due to a change of heart became a true friend - would come and go as well. Over time, the TARDIS crew would get smaller and smaller, which made the writing easier and easier…but also left out that wonderful family dynamic that the earlier parts of the series seemed to have. It’s sort of a give or take game here.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nThis is the first time where my choice of suggestion is NOT my favorite episode for this respective Doctor. My favorite Peter Davison episode is “The Five Doctors,” but since that one DOES feature…well…FIVE DOCTORS, and Davison, while the main focus, still has to share the screen with so many others, I don’t think it’s the best one to show what made HIM, and his era, so particularly special. Now, I know a lot of fans would probably recommend his final episode, “Caves of Androzani,” but a.) I don’t want to include the final episodes for ANY of the Doctors, if I can, and b.) I know this is heresy, but I’ve always felt “Caves of Androzani” to be somewhat overrated. No, my choice of recommendation is “Earthshock”: this story featured the return of the Cybermen (who had not been seen in about six years, and whose previous story had sucked, anyway), and if you’re wondering why I called Adric the Jason Todd of the Doctor Who universe, this episode will show you what I mean. In my opinion, it’s the very best Cybermen episode, and it’s my second favorite of Peter Davison’s era. It shows all the qualities that made him a great Doctor in spades, and also plays with that family dynamic I mentioned quite delightfully. It’s hard to find a better place to start with him than this.\n\nNext time, we’ll discuss Colin Baker, the Sixth Doctor: the Most Underappreciated Time Lord of All.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we’ll be discussing arguably the most iconic modern Doctor. This is David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAfter Christopher Eccleston left the program, Scottish actor David Tennant - a rising star - was called upon to take his place. While every other Doctor before and since was allowed to keep their natural dialect, Tennant was directed to speak with an Estuary English accent. This, of course, did absolutely nothing to prevent his popularity: to this day, when people think of Doctor Who, Tennant seems to be one of two key faces to automatically come to mind, the other being Tom Baker. Matt Smith, his successor (more on him next time) seems to be catching up, however…but I digress. I think this is because of the reason I said last time: “You never forget your first Doctor.” While Tennant was not the first New Who Doctor, he lasted significantly longer than Christopher Eccleston, with three seasons and more than three times as many stories within them. As a result, more people would simply RECOGNIZE him as the Doctor, and since many of these young budding fans had likely never even seen Tom Baker or any of the other Classic Doctors, it’s not surprising that Tennant would rise rapidly in terms of popularity. I strongly suspect the same goes for Smith, and given a few years, more and more people will say the same about Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker. It helps that a lot of the people who worked on and STILL work on the modern series were and are huge fans of Doctor Who themselves: it’s become a show made for fans BY fans, and Tennant was no exception: he was a HUGE fan of Doctor Who, and this became his dream role.\n\nThat fact is not surprising, because, alongside Tom Baker and perhaps Sylvester McCoy, I would argue that Tennant’s portrayal of the Doctor has the least disconnect between the role and the performer. It’s telling that, ever since seeing him AS the Doctor, nearly every time I hear or see Tennant in anything, the Doctor is all that comes to mind: Kilgrave from the MCU? “Oh, so THAT’S what it would have been like if he played The Master instead!” His version of Hamlet? “Oh, so THIS is what it would have been like if Shakespeare had invited him to perform in one episode!” Scrooge McDuck? (pauses) Okay, actually, as Scrooge he’s pretty invisible, but hey, if DuckTales had ever featured the Daleks? I wouldn’t have been surprised. Tennant brings a natural zaniness and melodramatic intensity to the role, mixing swaggering humor with something much deeper and darker to create a truly fascinating take on the Time Lord.\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nOf all the Doctors I’ve talked about, Tennant’s Tenth is actually the single hardest for me to analyze and describe in terms of personality. That’s actually, I think, what makes him so particularly fascinating: he’s not an easy Doctor to categorize, so to speak. Mixing elements of various early Doctors with his own special seasoning, Tennant creates a particularly changeable Time Lord, whose moods and ethics are not easily explained.\n\nOn the surface, Ten at first seems like a stark contrast to the Ninth Doctor: instead of the moody, slightly standoffish character of Eccleston, Tennant’s is superficially more extroverted and chipper, with a particularly zany sense of humor and a sort of wild-eyed passion in everything he does. He is, at first, a seemingly much happier person, but we soon start to realize the traumas are still there, and just as strong as ever: this is a man haunted by failure, who no longer wants to see things fall apart the way they did.\n\nAs the Tenth Doctor’s era continues, the character develops in a startling and unexpected way: still haunted by his actions in the Great Time War, the Tenth Doctor puts on a veneer of apologetic pacifism, always trying to give his enemies a chance, even when they don’t deserve it. But at the same time, he is absolutely ruthless when he has to be, and does things to his foes that often make him seem more villainous than almost any Doctor (the only other one who might come close is the Seventh), as his vengeance on his foes is particularly nasty at times. There’s something particularly unhinged about his Doctor, like he’s constantly teetering on the boundary between sanity and madness; between being a good samaritan and a punishing devil. He can be hilariously silly, he can be vulnerable and sympathetic, and he can also be a holy terror, sometimes almost all at once. There’s a reason that, in the audio plays, there’s actually a parallel universe where the Tenth Doctor ends up becoming a villain rather than a hero: of all the Doctors out there, he’s one of the most morally and psychologically questionable, but he still manages to be endearing.\n\nThe most notable thing people have noted about the Tenth Doctor’s era is the “Space Jesus” angle: Christ-like allegorical imagery and elements are used with the character constantly throughout his time on the TARDIS. He’s also VERY certain of his powers, perhaps to the point of outright hubris: this was the first Doctor to give what I like to call the “I’m the Doctor, STFU” speeches that modern Who is filled with today. Just by saying who he was, in grand fashion, this Doctor could bring his foes to their knees, and placed himself as a high authority. However, what’s interesting about all this is the way it’s used, and how his story arc tracks through his time in the franchise. At first, in the series, his attitude is actually treated as a good thing, as he takes down wrongful authority figures and saves lives, and while he’s egotistical, he’s also compassionate…but as time goes on, his arrogance starts to spiral out of control. We start to see that he’s not nearly as perfect as he believes, or as anyone would like to think. Without going into too many spoilers, this Doctor’s end is particularly bitter, as he is forced to come to terms with the fact that he’s neither invulnerable nor almighty, and the toughest challenges in his life are ones he ultimately has to face alone.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nAgain, the NewWho series tends to go for costumes that are less about “walking anachronisms” and instead ones that would fit in more with a modern, contemporary society’s norms. However, with the Tenth Doctor, the costumes DO start to become more eccentric. In some ways, this was another very Sherlockian Doctor: not as detached as Sherlock Holmes, but with the same mixture of madcap heroics and flawed danger. In fact, many of his stories played out almost like detective stories, including one episode where he met famed mystery writer, Agatha Christie. As a result, Tennant’s costume is something of a sort of “eccentric detective” getup. He’s often seen wearing a trenchcoat, like someone out of an old film noir, and under the trenchcoat he typically wore a suit of brown or blue, with pinstripes and a tie. All of this is elegant and almost 1940s esque, but then it gets contrasted by the unconventional choice of sandshoes, a spiky sort of hairdo, and the wide-lensed reading glasses he occasionally wears. He’s both classy and yet a total dork, for lack of a better way of putting it. On anyone else, the costume might look a bit bizarre, the different elements not necessarily smoothly tying together, but Tennant is so at home in the costume, that the way he moves, sits, and stands in it always makes it feel like a second skin: it’s all natural to him, and so he can be all the things he needs to be - from dangerous to daffy - no matter what the weather.\n\nNOTABLE COMPANIONS\n\nThe Tenth Doctor started out with Rose Tyler as his companion, carried on from Christopher Eccleston. Fans have mixed feelings about Rose’s time with the Doctor, but personally I didn’t mind it, and the moment when she left the show was really quite sad. My big problem is that Rose seemed to be treated as the “uber-companion” for the reminder of Ten’s time in the series. I suppose it makes sense, since - unless you count Grace Holloway and POSSIBLY Jo Grant - this was the first time the Doctor had actually apparently fallen in love with his companion. However, it became a problem when the next major companion - Martha Jones - showed up. Martha starts off with promise, but in my opinion she became rather bland as the series went on; she really felt like she was just a replacement for Rose, and one wonders why she even HAD to be replaced. Did Billie Piper, Rose’s actress, just not want to do the show anymore? (Seems unlikely, since she returned several times as a recurring character for the rest of Ten and even Eleven’s run.) Then came the third major companion, Donna Noble: in Donna’s first appearance, she’s a bit annoying, in my opinion, but when she became a fully-fledged companion…I’m going to be honest, I think she became my favorite companion of David Tennant’s. Part of this may be because of the relationship between both the actors AND the characters: in contrast to Rose and Martha, the Doctor no longer wanted a romantic interest, he just wanted a friend. And that was cool with Donna, because that was all SHE saw the Doctor as: her absolute best friend. In a way, she was a lot like Sarah Jane Smith (who made a surprise return during this era as a recurring character), but with even more sass and spunk than before. Actress Catherine Tate and David Tennant had amazing chemistry, and it’s telling that they would often work together after this - especially in comedic settings - as their friendship offscreen is and was just as powerful as it was onscreen. One last character worth noting is River Song: not a COMPANION, but a major recurring character who first appeared in this era. River was revealed to be the Doctor’s wife, but who met the Doctor in a future lifetime. Naturally, this led to shenanigans and heartbreak alike; all in a day’s work for this series.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nDEAR GOD, WHAT DO I CHOOSE?! XD The issue with the Tenth Doctor’s era, in stories, is that it’s sort of a giant mixed bag, in my opinion. There really isn’t any one episode of the entire show I would truly call definitive. Some showcase great villains, or have great stories, but aren’t necessarily most emblematic of what this Doctor was all about. Others are terrific showcases for David Tennant’s character, but lack the proper Companions needed or have particularly famous baddies involved. Some episodes are still great, some were well-received back then but have since received some rightful backlash, and some suck but at least have a sort of “so bad it’s good” quality to them. So…jeeze and darn, what do I even PICK here? I siphoned through a LOT of iconic stories before finally deciding on what I felt was the best choice here…not my FAVORITE Tenth Doctor story, I should point out, but the one I think comes the CLOSEST to a “definitive Tenth Doctor episode” I can find. That episode is the two-parter “Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead.” In this one, the Doctor and Donna Noble have their first meeting with River Song, while doing battle with a race of carnivorous shadow monsters known as the Vashta Nerada. The story is dark, high-flying in its intellectual mind-bending, has a great sense of humor underneath it all, features the best Doctor/Companion relationship of the era (in my opinion), showcases River Song, and has one of the Doctor’s most iconic “I’m The Doctor, Now STFU” speeches in the show’s history. There are so many other episodes worth noting, it’s not even funny, but this one, I think, has the MOST of all the things I love about the Tenth Doctor’s era, so it gets my vote: if you’re only going to watch ONE David Tennant episode…don’t, please, watch more than one if you can, but consider starting with this one first.\n\nNext time we’ll be discussing Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor: The Madman in a Box.\n\nWelcome to Two Weeks in the TARDIS! I’m talking about the different versions of the titular protagonist from “Doctor Who.” Each day I’ll be covering a different Doctor, going in order from the First to the Thirteenth.\n\nToday, we’ll be discussing The Chessmaster: the Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn the mid-80s, Doctor Who was in crisis mode. Colin Baker had been (unfairly) fired from the show, and then-current producer, John Nathan Turner, had largely lost interest in the project. The BBC executives, for various reasons, felt that the series really should have been canceled during the Sixth Doctor’s tenure. It was really the fans who kept the show going, as when the series went on a brief hiatus in-between C.B.’s two seasons, public outcry proved far greater than anybody had anticipated. For what would ultimately be the final three seasons of the Classic era, Sylvester McCoy - a performer with a VERY bizarre and multitalented background - was ultimately chosen to play the Doctor. Apparently, McCoy was suggested by his friend and colleague, Ken Campbell, who had been screen-tested for the Doctor, but for one reason or another was not given the role. At Campbell’s suggestion, McCoy was found, auditioned, and given a screen test, before ultimately being cast as the newest lead in the series.\n\nThe first season of McCoy’s era is one of the worst in the show’s history: the show was trying to go for a more comedic tone than ever in that first season, due to backlash it had received due to the violent content in much of the series for many, MANY years. In an effort to keep it going, the season went for a much more lighthearted and sort of pantomime tone…but this endeavor proved to be a cosmic backfire, especially with the budget plummeting to nothing. The latter two seasons of the Classic show retained much of their dignity - I would argue that they were the single two best seasons at least since Tom Baker’s time, if not in the entire series - but by that time, it was just too little, too late. As a result, I often personally feel that Sylvester McCoy never gets enough credit for his work in the role, although I will say that, more and more recently, the fanbase for the Seventh Doctor seems to have grown, and McCoy remains a popular Doctor among personal friends I know who are big fans of the show. He’s among my absolute favorites, too, though I won’t say just where he sits. For those who don’t already know, you’ll have to wait till the final day of this event to learn that. ;)\n\nPERSONALITY\n\nThis Doctor is another who sees development over the course of his three seasons. However, unlike with William Hartnell and Colin Baker, who both started off as darker, more volatile takes on the character, and softened up as the show went on, McCoy goes in the opposite direction: if you watch the Seventh Doctor’s first and final episodes back to back, he almost feels like two different people. Many of the mannerisms and such are the same, but you can plainly see and tell that this is a hardened Time Lord who has become much more dangerous than he started out, by the end of the run.\n\nMcCoy had actually been a fan of the Patrick Troughton era of the show, and wanted to create a Doctor somewhat similar to that, but of course with his own spin. Just like the Second Doctor, the Seventh is a clown on the surface, but a ruthless mastermind underneath it all. The difference, however, is in how McCoy plays it off, and how the character is treated. The Seventh Doctor is arguably the darkest Doctor of the entire series: he’s referred to as “The Chessmaster” by some fans, and for good reasons. With the Second Doctor, he usually just stumbled into problems and then had to use his guile and cunning to solve them. The Seventh Doctor was arguably the first incarnation to tackle evil head-on: nine times out of ten, he already knew something was going down, and already had an idea of how to defeat it. It then just became a matter of nudging the game in the right direction, strategizing and plotting out pathways to whatever victory he wanted to ensure. Even if no one else knew the answers, he did. He was more mysterious, always hiding things and clearly haunted by something in his distant past, and also at times much more manipulative. With Patrick Troughton, you never really felt frightened; you were happy when the Doctor won, and impressed by his craftiness. McCoy, however, is an unassuming menace: he looks like a harmless eccentric, but he is arguably the darkest and most powerful Time Lord of them all, at least up to that point. Not even the other good guys were safe with him, at times, and that was what made him so fascinating.\n\nCOSTUME\n\nI absolutely love the Seventh Doctor’s costume. Once again, it remains mostly the same throughout his tenure; the only major thing that changes is his coat. In the first two seasons, McCoy wears an off-white, soft-looking jacket. In his final season, he changes to a brown coat, darker and a little less soft in apparent texture. His costume was changed a bit more noticeably in his final appearance in the Paul McGann TV movie, but it still retained the same basic silhouette. I know most people, when they think of “Doctor Who,” think of Tom Baker or David Tennant first, in terms of the look, but for me, McCoy is actually who I think of first. When I hear that title, this is the kind of look I think of: a sort of wacky professor on holiday, mystery quite literally written all over him, from his question mark jumper to his awesome umbrella. (The former seems to be polarizing among fans, but I’ve always liked it.) Once again, it works for the character, as well: the darkening coat and color scheme obviously matches the development of the character, while the general absent-minded doctor demeanor works to showcase his duplicity: he’s academic yet clownish at the same time. You can buy him plotting schemes and hatching plans just as you can him performing circus stunts and magic tricks. It suits the sort of vaudevillian sense of style the character displays, and which the actor had long since mastered, while still retaining a sense of dignity and strangeness.\n\nCOMPANIONS\n\nMuch like the previous Doctor, number Seven really only had two companions of note. The first was Mel Bush, inherited from the Sixth Doctor. While I’ve never particularly liked Mel that much, I will concede that I think she worked much better with the Seventh Doctor than the Sixth. She was his companion throughout his first season, and the actress who played her - Bonnie Langford - was actually very good friends with McCoy offscreen. As a result, they had much better chemistry, as the wise but peculiar Doctor and his giddy, peppy companion made for a good pair. It doesn’t excuse the fact Mel couldn’t seem to protect herself when it really mattered, despite knowing Judo, nor does it excuse the fact that her departure comes pretty much out of nowhere, nor does it excuse how badly fit she was with the Sixth Doctor…but I can at least TOLERATE her here. And, to be fair, she proved to merely be a stepping stone for a much better character’s arrival: the indomitable Sophie Aldred as Ace.\n\nAce is my favorite companion in the entire Classic era, and quite probably my favorite Companion in all of Doctor Who history. Just like Jamie and Leela before her, Ace was the brawn to the Doctor’s brain: a tomboyish explosives fanatic with so much hutzpah, she became famous for BEATING UP A DALEK WITH A BASEBALL BAT. Yeah. This gal took on a FREAKING DALEK with a BASEBALL BAT, and WON. Perhaps even more impressive, she took on A WHOLE LEGION OF CYBERMEN, using nothing but a SLINGSHOT, and once again, she WON. Ace. Is. EPIC.\n\nBut her capability is not her only major trait: Ace, in many ways, is the prototype for many of the modern Who companions. Several characters of the modern era, Companion-wise, are almost as much the focus as the Doctor, with special character arcs of their own that run throughout their time in the TARDIS. Ace was the first Companion to really have that same sense of development: many stories focused just as much on her growth as a character as they did on the Doctor’s wily and wild adventures. Facing her fears, finding out she’s part of a grand plan in the universe, coming to grips with her animal instincts, even dealing with romantic emotions…Ace was not only a brilliant double for McCoy’s Doctor, but a fantastically superb and well-developed character in her own right. It really is a shame to me that while folks like Sarah Jane and Jo Grant have come back in the modern era, I don’t think Ace ever has. It would be awesome to see a grown-up Ace sometime in a special episode…it would also be awesome to see more of the Classic Doctors appear in the actual show, older though they may be, but I digress.\n\nRECOMMENDED VIEWING\n\nI had a really hard time with this one, because there are honestly SO many highlights in the Sylvester McCoy era: so many good or just simply important episodes are here, partially because these three seasons are the final ones of the Classic show. However, after much deliberation, I decided to recommend “Remembrance of the Daleks.” Most people seem to name this as one of the top three to five best stories of the McCoy era, myself included. Not only is it the final appearance of both Davros and the Daleks in the Classic era, but it also serves as a FANTASTIC introduction to what makes McCoy’s Doctor so great, and even what makes Ace such a magnificent companion. While this isn’t my absolute favorite episode of the era (it’s a close second, with “Greatest Show in the Galaxy” at number one), I would argue strongly that it’s the most definitive, and I think I’ve actually watched it more times than my actual number one. This was also the first McCoy episode I ever actually saw, so it has a warm place in my heart. Also, there’s a cameo from Jeffrey from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in it! Come on, THAT has to be worth a watch, if nothing else is. XD\n\nWe’re halfway through now! Next time, we’ll discuss Paul McGann, the Eighth Doctor: The One Hit Wonder."
