        "text": "Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston is one of the celebrities to feature on the Christmas special of BBC panel show Would I Lie To You? The 58-year-old actor, who is best known for his portrayal as the TV Time Lord, will be joining host Rob Brydon and team captains Lee Mack and David Mitchell on the show.\n\nAn actor who is very selective of the roles he chooses to play, Eccleston’s casting as the 9th Doctor in the 2005 Doctor Who revival came as a great surprise to many people. According to the actor, the quality of writer Russell T Davies’ scripts were the reason that he decided to take the role. At the time, he also said that he enjoyed having the chance to work on a series aimed at a different demographic than his previous work, noting that \"it's aimed at families, so I'm kind of acting for children and I feel very lucky to be able to do that\".\n\nIt is common knowledge that Eccleston’s time on Doctor Who was short lived and he only appeared in one series before regenerating into David Tennant, who played the 10th (and now 14th) Doctor. But why did he leave the series after only a year? Here’s everything that you need to know.\n\nRead more: Doctor Who 60th Anniversary special: Everything we know about the return of David Tennant and Catherine Tate\n\nWhy did Christopher Eccleston leave Doctor Who after one series?\n\nIn 2005, after giving his life to save companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), the 9th Doctor succumbed to regeneration and with a cheeky smile and one final delivery of his iconic, “Fantastic!” catchphrase, he turned into David Tennant’s iteration of the character.\n\nOn March 30 that year, mere days after Doctor Who’s revival had begun, the BBC released a statement confirming that Eccleston would not be staying in the role because of fears that he’d be “typecast”. A month later, the organisation was forced to apologise after admitting that they hadn’t consulted the actor before the statement was made.\n\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard in 2010, Eccleston stated that he \"didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in\" and that he did not want to do any more based on the experience. He added: \"I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than to be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nFurther discussing his reasons for quitting to the Radio Times in 2018, Eccleston said: “My relationship with my three immediate superiors – the showrunner, the producer and co-producer – broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered. They lost trust in me, and I lost faith and trust and belief in them.\n\n“Billie [Piper], who we know was and is brilliant, was very, very nervous and very, very inexperienced. So, you had that, and then you had me. Very, very experienced, possibly the most experienced, but out of my comfort zone. When I left, I gave my word to Russell T Davies that I wouldn’t do anything to damage the show but they did things to damage me. I didn’t criticise anybody.” Asked if Davies was aware of the issues, Eccleston said: “If you’re the showrunner, you know everything. That’s your job,” before adding that he “never will have” a working relationship with the writer again.\n\nIn 2013, Eccleston was offered the chance to return to Doctor Who for the show’s 50th anniversary special, ‘The Day of the Doctor’. After reading writer Steven Moffat's script, he ultimately decided not to return. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt. While he’s yet to return to the television series, Eccleston has come back to Doctor Who for audio adventures made by Big Finish Productions. He continues to make these to this day. Catch him next on Would I Lie To You? on Friday, December 30 at 8.30pm on BBC One.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
