        "text": "Posted by Sage\n\nYou may have noticed that Kim and I didn’t do our usual red carpet and award show coverage for this year’s Grammys. Why? Because even people who win Grammys know that the Grammys are basically irrelevant.\n\nBut let’s just put a pin in that for now. Today, we’re going to use the Grammys for our own selfish reasons, and those reasons are OTP-related. This week’s playlist highlights are all by 2013 Grammy nominated or Grammy winning artists. And being a featured artist on Head Over Feels is the REAL prize.\n\n“Ghosts That We Knew” – Mumford & Sons\n\n“You saw my pain washed out in the rain\n\nBroken glass, saw the blood run from my veins\n\nBut you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart\n\nAnd you knelt beside my hope torn apart\n\nSo lead me back, turn south from that place\n\nAnd close my eyes to my recent disgrace\n\n‘Cause you know my call\n\nAnd we’ll share my all\n\nAnd our children come and they will hear me roar.”\n\nIf this 50th anniversary business doesn’t give us some kind of update on TenToo/Rose and their adorable babies, I QUIT. Seriously, I am out. You can keep your bow ties and your sonics and your crippling heartbreak. I’ll have escaped and started a fandom for, like, that new Ron Weasley show from the My Name is Earl guy or something.\n\n“Gold” – Original Broadway Cast of Once\n\n“And I love her so\n\nI wouldn’t trade her for gold\n\nI’m walking on moon beams\n\nI was born with a silver spoon\n\nAnd I’m gonna be me\n\nI’m gonna be free\n\nI’m walking on moon beams\n\nAnd staring out to sea.”\n\nWe all have those friends, right? The ones who prefer their relationships to be dramatic and tragic 24/7? I’ve never understood that. If you don’t have fun together, why is it even worth it?\n\nWhen Rose tells Nine that life is “better with two,” she’s right. But it’s gotta be the RIGHT two. If Doctor Who were about two miserable people who bicker all the time and then retreat to their separate rooms to write emo-y LiveJournal posts, I don’t think this fandom would even exist.\n\n“Gold” is about the people in this world who, when you’re with them, make you the very best version of yourself. You can practically see the weight fall off of the Doctor’s shoulders as Series 1 progresses. And he never forgets it. He may not have been able to say those three little words on Bad Wolf Bay, but he comes close. “You made me better,” he says to her. And isn’t that basically the same thing?\n\nContinue Reading\n\nPosted by Sage\n\nMusic business, I am on to you. You’re all secret Doctor Who fans. Just admit it. Let your Whovian freak flag fly.\n\nA few of you are doing a particularly shoddy job of keeping your fandom membership under wraps. Why else would your songs show up six, seven, EIGHT times on our Rose/Doctor playlist?\n\nThis week’s post is about the most well-represented artists on our soundtrack to the universe’s greatest OTP. Whether you know it or not, you’ve been writing music that perfectly scores our Rose and Doctor.\n\nAlso, Coldplay remains awesome. David agrees. Deal with it.\n\n“Building a Mystery” – Sarah McLachlan\n\n“You woke up screaming aloud\n\nA prayer from your secret god\n\nYou feed off our fears\n\nAnd hold back your tears, oh\n\nGive us a tantrum\n\nAnd a know-it-all grin\n\nJust when we need one\n\nWhen the evening’s thin\n\nOh you’re a beautiful\n\nA beautiful fucked up man\n\nYou’re setting up your\n\nRazor wire shrine.”\n\nI’ve had to cross reference this song in my mind, as it has always been, until now, strictly a Fox Mulder anthem.\n\nLook at those lyrics. That’s 100% the FBI’s Most Unwanted. But Fox is going to have to share it with my Doctor. They have a lot in common, after all. Complex and single-minded. Emotions turning on a dime. Obsessed with their own, specific morality. And they both press all my romantic, anti-hero buttons.\n\nOn a personal note: where did weird, folky Sarah McLachlan go and why was she replaced with Adult Contemporary Sad Dog Commercial Sarah McLachlan? Remember that time she spent an entire music video naked in a mud pit? I blame the kids. And the ASPCA.\n\n“Dreaming with a Broken Heart” – John Mayer\n\n“When you’re dreaming with a broken heart\n\nThe giving up is the hardest part\n\nShe takes you in with your crying eyes\n\nThen all at once you have to say goodbye\n\nWondering could you stay my love?\n\nWill you wake up by my side?\n\nNo she can’t, ’cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.”\n\nWhen pressed to choose, I will usually pick the “Impossible Planet”/”Satan Pit” two-parter as my favorite modern era Who episode. But maybe I should change my answer, because I keep coming back to “Human Nature”/”The Family of Blood” in these posts.\n\nWe’re mostly used to the enigmatic and manic Doctor that Sarah was singing about just a few seconds ago. But, ugh, how these episodes get right into the heart of him like no others do. The Doctor-Doctor won’t tell Rose how he feels about her. He won’t tell anyone else either, and hardly admits it to himself. But John Smith doesn’t know that. He just dreams and writes it down.\n\nThis is what’s ACTUALLY written in “The Journal of Impossible Things” and why people who deny that Rose/Ten is a real thing are just plain wrong:\n\n“I find myself wanting to draw a perfect Rose, over and over although I cannot find a Rose anywhere!\n\nRoses\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nThe perfect Rose\n\nIt’s a perfect rose.\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nRose perfect Rose\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nPerfect Rose\n\nIn my dreams I keep asking a girl where to find one, and she is dressed in the most extraordinarily immodest way.\n\nShe will not answer me, and she keeps walking away.\n\nI keep dreaming of a girl.\n\nGirl in my dreams\n\nI remember this girl I have drawn her although I know her well in my dream\n\nI know her well I know.\n\nI know her\n\nShe is my-“\n\nJust plain wrong, I tell ya.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPosted by Kim\n\nEven though I was born in Michigan, I grew up in Nashville, so country music is practically ingrained into my DNA. I LOVE country music, and I get very annoyed when anyone says they hate it. In fact, I am convinced that anyone that says they hate country music has never really given it a chance. Sure there are some TERRIBLE songs (“Red Solo Cup” is the most recent big hit that comes to mind), but that’s true of any genre (“Gangnam Style” anyone?). To me, what sets Country Music apart as a genre is its focus on story telling. Not that a good pop song can’t tell a story (we’ve got hundreds on this playlist that do) but country songs often take it to the next level and can make you feel all sorts of emotions. Naturally, there are many country songs on this playlist that conjure up Doctor Who feelings. So those who claim to HATE country should give these songs a listen and then get back to me.\n\nAnd if you get back to me and say you still hate country music, I can’t help you. And I also question whether or not you have a soul.\n\n“Somebody Like You” – Keith Urban\n\n“There’s a new wind blowing like I’ve never known.\n\nI’m breathing deeper than I’ve ever done.\n\nAnd it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do.\n\nI wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.\n\nAnd I’m letting go of all my lonely yesterdays.\n\nI’ve forgivin’ myself for the mistakes I’ve made.\n\nNow there’s just one thing, the only thing I wanna do.\n\nI wanna love somebody, love somebody like you…”\n\nThis song screams the Ninth Doctor at the end of “End of the World”, which I also covered in my last playlist post. While the Doctor still has many many gruff moments post “End of the World” (which IS only the second episode of the series), I always pinpoint the end of that episode as the moment where The Doctor started to heal and began to open himself up to Rose. He doesn’t completely change all at once, there would be no fun in that. It’s an ongoing process. But in that moment where he and Rose head off to get some chips, The Doctor begins to let go of his past and relax and allows himself to think that there could be something more for him.\n\n“I Run To You” – Lady Antebellum\n\n“We run on fumes\n\nYour life and mine\n\nLike the sands of time\n\nSlippin’ right on through\n\nAnd our love’s the only truth\n\nThat’s why I run to you.\n\nThis world keeps spinning faster\n\nInto a new disaster so I run to you\n\nI run to you baby\n\nAnd when it all starts coming undone\n\nBaby you’re the only one I run to\n\nI run to you.”\n\nThis song is about partnership and finding that one person you can count on above anyone else. If that is not what you think the Doctor and Rose are to each other, then you are watching the show wrong. Fact.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPosted by Sage\n\nYour favorite OTP playlist took a break over the holiday season, but we’re back! Yes, it’s 2013 and we are still writing about these idiots and their stupidly gorgeous faces.\n\nThis week’s playlist post is all about time, that heartless bitch. You might think life with a TARDIS would make time inconsequential, but nope. Nope, nope, nope. As hard as he tries to outrun it or stretch it out, the Doctor’s time with his companions always ends. These five songs are all about the the role that time plays in the relationship between the Doctor and Rose Tyler.\n\n*Disclaimer: When I told Kim which songs I picked for this week, she replied, “KILL ME.” So, you know. Fair warning.\n\n“Time” – Chantal Kreviazuk\n\nTime, where did you go?\n\nWhy did you leave me here alone?\n\nWait, don’t go so fast\n\nI’m missing the moments as they pass\n\nI rewatched the “End of Time” two-parter right before Christmas and was just flattened by a few things I hadn’t noticed about this heartbreaking scene. The Doctor knows that he’s dying, and he’s on a farewell tour to all of his companions. He visits everyone in the “present” of their timelines (Martha and Mickey are engaged, Donna’s getting married), but, of course, he doesn’t have that option with Rose. He can’t go back in his own timeline and see the two of them together, so he looks in on a Rose that doesn’t know him yet.\n\nAnd when a complete (albeit totally beautiful) stranger steps out of the shadows to ask a teen girl what day it is, Rose Tyler acts like she’s just met her best friend. The Doctor’s face is PAINED as he talks to her, especially when she tells him it’s 2005. He knows that she has all of their adventures ahead of her, while he’s already left them behind. And then, (this is what shattered me this time), the camera follows Rose into her building and up the stairs through the window, until she’s completely out of sight. BECAUSE HE DID TOO. CAN YOU STAND IT?\n\nThe first and last face this face saw.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nPosted by Kim and Sage\n\nIt is one of our personal goals to turn all of our friends into Whovians. We just want everyone to understand WHY we are so overwhelmed with feelings all the time. We have a couple of friends on the VERGE of dipping their toes into Doctor Who Universe. Our friend Samantha already KNOWS that the Ultimate OTP of the show (despite our undying devotion to Rose x Ten) is actually The Doctor and the TARDIS. She got there on her OWN, you guys! We were so proud! Recently our friend Anna asked us what episodes we would recommend for someone considering jumping into the lifetime commitment of being a Doctor Who Fan.\n\nShe also said she was asking “for a friend”.\n\nA likely story. We know you are on the verge, Anna. Don’t deny it.\n\nThat got us thinking…where WOULD we start? Personally, when I (Kim) started Doctor Who around this time last year, I started with the first episode of Series One, “Rose”. Then again, I HAVE been accused of being a “Completist” on a well-known pop culture website. I don’t deny it. WHY WOULD YOU START ANYWHERE BUT THE BEGINNING?!\n\nWe put a call out to our Twitter followers and Facebook fans (PS: are YOU following us yet?) about which episodes they would suggest to newbies, which spurred a great debate. Eventually 6 episodes (well, technically 8, as there are two Two Parters on this list) rose to the top of the heap. Let’s take a look at them, shall we?\n\nAlso to Anna and Sam: You WILL become Whovians in 2013. You should accept your fate now.\n\n“Rose” (Series One, Episode One) – Sage\n\n@ottofernandez: “My first episode was “Rose.” I don’t think it best represents the series, but why not start at the beginning?”\n\nAs a famous singing nun once said, the beginning is, in fact, “a very good place to start.” For your completist friends who refuse to watch anything out of order, you have no choice but to begin here. My own first experience with the Doctor was in this pilot episode of the modern series. “Rose” introduces us to Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, his new companion Rose Tyler (my future wife Billie Piper), Rose’s mum Jackie Tyler and boyfriend Mickey Smith, and the TARDIS, the Doctor’s transport across galaxies. Did I mention it also travels in time?\n\nThis episode is a romp. “Rose” only hints at the emotional depth of the series with the “turn of the earth” monologue and Eccleston’s portrayal of Nine’s worldweariness. The effects are charmingly low-budget and silly. But it also brings us up to speed on 40-some years of history in about 45 minutes and establishes a crackling chemistry with the Doctor and Rose. Showrunner Russell T. Davies wrote this one and cleverly peppers in snappy dialogue that also lets us know what to expect in the world of this show. This exchange is one of my favorites.\n\nRose: “If you’re an alien, how come you sound like you’re from the north?”\n\nDoctor: “Lots of planets have a north!”\n\nIn six words, Davies establishes that, despite being able to access any point in space and time, the Doctor will spend a lot of time kicking it in present-day London. And despite knowing every single language there has been or will be, his default is modern English with a Brit accent. If you need a better explanation than that, then this isn’t the show for you. Move along.\n\n“Rose” packs a bigger wallop on rewatch. When I first returned to it after catching up to series 7, it meant so much more to me to see the meeting of two of my all-time favorite characters and the inside of the TARDIS for the first time. Any Whovian who doesn’t get chills when Nine grabs Rose’s hand in that dark basement and whispers, “run,” isn’t a Whovian at all and is probably dead inside.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nPosted by Kim\n\nWhenever I go to the gym, I always hashtag my FourSquare check-in #runningfortheTARDIS. Technically I guess I should say #ellipticallingfortheTARDIS, but that just doesn’t roll off the tongue as well. It is both a way to connect with my fitness buddy Jenn and very often my sole motivating factor that gets me through my cardio. Cause let’s face it. They do a LOT of running on Doctor Who. And when the Doctor comes for me (SHUT UP HE WILL), I want to be ready. I can’t be slowing him down when we are running away from Daleks or Cybermen or Dinosaurs!\n\nThere also happen to be a lot of songs about running on the playlist. Songs about running away together. Songs about running TOWARDS each other. Best of all, songs that capture that incandescent and reckless feeling that comes along with being head over heels in love with someone. Bonus: All but one of these songs are pretty happy, so you won’t want to kill yourself at the end of this post.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\n“Get Out of This Town” – Carrie Underwood\n\n“Let’s get out of this town tonight!\n\nNothing but dust in the shadows,\n\nGone by morning light.\n\nSomewhere we won’t ever get caught, ever be found,\n\nBaby, let’s just get out of this town!\n\nDon’t need directions, don’t need a map\n\nIf we get lost I’ll be good with that.\n\nYeah, we’ll find a way to make the time pass…”\n\nFor as much as we focus on all the ANGST that comes along with Rose and Ten (because we do love all the angst) we tend to forget about the times when they were just blissfully happy together. The giggling and flirting in “Tooth and Claw”. The opening scene of “The Idiot’s Lantern” (“You going my way, doll?”). Their sexy sleuthing in “Fear Her”. And that running gif completely personifies this song. Yeah, they are likely running for their lives at that point. But that moment when they look at each other and just LAUGH and keep running. He’s saying, “Let’s get out of here, baby.” That, my dear readers, is the breathless feeling of being in love personified.\n\nAnd the line “Yeah, we’ll find a way to make the time pass…” = doing it, doing it, TARDIS doing it. You know this to be true.\n\nContinue reading →"
