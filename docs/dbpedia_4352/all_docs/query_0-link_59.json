The former Doctor Who actor cited family circumstances involving his children as the reason he is unable to travel. Edmonton Expo also announced Thursday on Twitter that Joonas Suatomo, the actor playing Chewbacca in the latest Star Wars movies, has cancelled his appearance due to illness. Edmonton Expo said on Twitter that it will be offering refunds on admission tickets until 2 p.m. Friday.

You were wonderful in that, how do you feel about the show?\n\nA: Thatâ€™s a very strange thing to do to your brain.\n\nItâ€™s in my top five favourites as a finished piece of work and as an experience. We had an interesting experience because I think we all felt we hadnâ€™t done our best with the first series, tonally, narratively.\n\nBut two episodes sort of popped: The episode with myself and the episode with Carrie Coon, those kind of landed just purely because of the form, I think, concentrating on one character. In the second series we got extraordinary reviews, the third even better. And then Damon Lindelof, who of course became famous for pissing a lot of people off with his finales (laughs), heâ€™s probably on record as the man with the worst reviews and the best reviews for a finale, which is Lost and then The Leftovers.\n\nI love the show. I adored making it; the cast and crew. And that character is one of the best Iâ€™ve ever been given.\n\nQ: Your episodes in particular are full of hope and disappointment and then hope again. Is your life a little like that? Is everybodyâ€™s?\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: I really loved the novel, but one character in particular appealed to me, a beautiful, dramatic implement, for want of a better word. And he only features on three pages of the novel! (Laughs.) The pilot script came in and I was asked to audition for the lead and I felt that was a long shot because Iâ€™m not your traditional handsome-looking leading man. But I somehow got an e-mail through to Damon saying â€˜I really want to be in this and I really want to play Matt Jamisonâ€™ and the response was, â€˜Matt Jamison isnâ€™t in the series!â€™ So he was over in London publicizing Star Trek and we met and talked about the book, and he claims I said a person not taken in the Rapture would get more religious. Thatâ€™s apparently what I said, it sounds far too intellectual for me. But he went away and made him a preacher obsessed, and over-identifying with the biblical Job. And that was it. I was in. I was in, because of that conversation. I kind of talked my way in.\n\nQ: Iâ€™m still trying to unpack it philosophically, itâ€™s still fresh. One thing I like about it is itâ€™s not necessarily an allegory for anything political, which is a little rare these days. I mean, thereâ€™s 9-11 in there, but itâ€™s a lot wider in scope than that.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: I can tell you what (author) Tom Perrotta said to me. I asked him â€˜what made you write this novelâ€™ and he said, â€˜I didnâ€™t know that until after Iâ€™d written it.â€™ He was playing tennis in New York with his son on a beautiful summerâ€™s day thinking it was just great, and later there was a phone call out of the blue and he was told his parents had been involved in a road accident and his father had died. Three years later he found himself writing a novel about sudden departure. He said, â€˜I think, Chris, that was the triggerâ€™ â€” how we, the leftovers, deal with sudden death.\n\nQ: I once went to Salford chasing the spot where the Smiths took the photo in front of the Salford Lads Club â€” is that a familiar spot to you?\n\nA: Oh yeah, I was born in Salford and the Smiths were my band, the only white guitar band Iâ€™ve ever loved. But of course Morrissey has really shat on that legacy with some of his bigotry.\n\nIâ€™ve always maintained you could listen to the Smiths albums without the lyrics and the voice. If you read the book Songs That Changed Your Life, etc., Johnny Marr was musically and sonically and from a business sense was a bigger part of the Smiths. Itâ€™s like, can we listen to Michael Jackson any more? I certainly canâ€™t. I find it very difficult to listen to Morrissey now, and I adored Morrissey. I think we can celebrate what he did with the Smiths: literate, politically informed, melodic, outsider champion â€” it was very early on he was championing inclusiveness for a beautiful set of albums, very important to me. Getting out of Salford and Manchester, moving to London, thinking that I had something to say. It was hugely important to my generation, working class people who wanted to go into the arts.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: Can you tell me about playing Macbeth at the Royal Shakespeare Company â€” that role was important to you early on, correct?\n\nA: I was in a production of Macbeth when I was 17 playing the bloody Sergeant and Macduff. It was on that night a key drama teacher came up to me and said, â€˜You know, Chris, I never really felt you could do this. But tonight I felt you might have a future.â€™ The combination of criticism and encouragement was very potent and from that night on I pursued it. At 17, my ambition became to play Macbeth at the RFC. And I did it last year.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: This is a weird one, but could you feel yourself reaching back through time?\n\nA: Yes, yes I could! I donâ€™t know if you remember a film called East Is East. The guy who wrote that, Ayub Khan Din, he grew up to write that film, and bizarrely my mother and father used to go into his chip shop when they were courting. Ayub played Macbeth, I got to watch it every night, and I became obsessed with it. I thought my father, who worked in a factory, could be that man. I couldnâ€™t imagine him being Hamlet or Henry V, but I could imagine my father being a very ambitious military man, working class and he could physically look after himself. Someone said, it might have been Harold Bloom, Shakespeare gave Hamlet all of his intellectual genius; he gave Macbeth the whole of his poetic imagination. And itâ€™s Macbethâ€™s imagination that destroys him. Iâ€™ve been told somebody whoâ€™s a soldier could not have a poetic imagination, but I knew that to be a lie. I felt I could play him. And I found out I couldnâ€™t, I was very disappointed in my performance. But Iâ€™m very, very glad I had a go at it.\n\nQ: Whatâ€™s more personally gratifying, being on stage in the moment or having something that people will be watching and talking about in 100 years?\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: Broadly definitely I much prefer theatre acting, because the surge of adrenalin is much higher and the reaction is immediate. Iâ€™ve worked with some great writers, like Jimmy McGovern (Accused), Peter Flannery (Our Friends in the North) and Russell T Davies (Doctor Who).\n\nBut the greatest of them all is William Shakespeare, to be able to internalize and explore that language â€” I did 119 performances of Macbeth.\n\nBut what I enjoy about film and television, and this may sound a bit strange, is when the cameraâ€™s not on you, and youâ€™re working with a very good actor, and theyâ€™re reaching for something, you can support them. You can be supportive and help them get the best out of them. And thereâ€™s something very special that passes between actors, and I really enjoy the communion.\n\nSomeone described television as poetic ideas realized industrially. And thatâ€™s what you have to do, ignore the hardware and reach out to the actor in front of you. I was mad on sport, and I didnâ€™t really enjoy scoring goals, I enjoyed creating the pass.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: You seem drawn to characters with a fair pinch of darkness â€” or is that just whatâ€™s happened to you since Shallow Grave?\n\nA: I think that comes from my father, from my background, which was reasonably tough. My father was a tough man. Iâ€™m publishing a book called I Love the Bones of You, a memoir of my relationship with my father, particularly through his years of dementia. Iâ€™m a dinosaur, born in â€™64, brought up in a very patriarchy, masculine, chauvinistic environment. I felt my father was all of those things. But within him was this great vulnerability and sensitivity he was afraid to show. He seemed a slightly dangerous man, and thatâ€™s informed how I played David Stevens in Shallow Grave.\n\nQ: Youâ€™re heading to a pop culture expo where a lot of the people are coming to see the sort of war-ravaged Doctor. Do you feel a connection to that show â€” I know itâ€™s complicated.\n\nA: (Laughs.) Yeah. Itâ€™s very complicated. Thisâ€™ll be my third convention, I did two in London. I resisted them for many, many years. With respect to everybody, I wanted to do other things. I am pursued by autograph hunters outside the theatre door, and you do meet people who are very obsessive, and theyâ€™ll want your autograph for a hundredth time. And theyâ€™ll be swapped, sold on eBay.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn my head I was expecting that at the conventions, and itâ€™s just not that at all. Itâ€™s people who are huge fans of certain shows, predominantly for me itâ€™s Doctor Who, but 28 Days Later comes into it, Heroes, and in Britain they talk to me about Our Friends in the North or Cracker. I was really surprised. They bring their memorabilia, but theyâ€™re not going to be selling it; itâ€™s a personal thing. They want to shake your hand, meet you, express affection for what youâ€™ve done. A guy I met said, â€˜These conventions have got a smile on their face,â€™ and they really have.\n\nIâ€™m also making money, letâ€™s not pretend otherwise.\n\nQ: What changed your mind?\n\nA: Iâ€™m not going to talk about that, itâ€™s a bit personal. But I will tell you I talked it through with David Warner and he said, â€˜No, youâ€™ve earned it.â€™ He said actors donâ€™t work all the time, and if thereâ€™s a way to make some money you can turn down jobs you donâ€™t want to do. My dad died a few years ago, so thereâ€™s a quasi-paternal thing going on there. He gave me a nudge.\n\nQ: It wasnâ€™t your intention to do only one year of Doctor Who when you signed up, was it?\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: We all went in not knowing. I adored playing the Doctor, Iâ€™m very proud of those 13 episodes, and I put my heart and soul into them. But my relationship with the three key people on the making of that series broke down, and I did not adore the way they were making that show. I left.\n\nQ: What you brought to that role was a sort of vulnerability weâ€™d rarely seen in the Doctor, he was shell-shocked.\n\nA: I think myself and Jodie Whittaker made history a bit. I was the first Doctor with a regional accent. I wasnâ€™t the first from a regional background, but if you listen to them all, they are all Queenâ€™s English, RP (Received Pronunciation) Standard English. There was an equation there between intelligence and the upper classes.\n\nAnd in a very tiny political way I felt that had to change. Alan Turing, who broke the Enigma code, an extraordinary scientist, was from Manchester.\n\nIf youâ€™re a kid form a working class background and heâ€™s talking like that, and heâ€™s authoritarian and (puts on posh accent) â€˜You know, he knows better than you,â€™ it can make you think certain things. And I would never take the credit for the reinvention of the series, but I changed that.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe reinvention sits squarely with Russell T Davies, who I donâ€™t like, who I donâ€™t get along with, but I admire his writing and his vision hugely. He feminized Doctor Who. Weâ€™ve had #metoo and a growth in feminist thinking since then, but he did it in 2004.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: It was wonderful to watch over here. The feeling was, oh theyâ€™re ahead of the game over there. Casual diversity, Capt. Jack with this sort of pansexuality, on mainstream television.\n\nA: Absolutely. And Jodie Whittaker has changed it even more by becoming the first female Doctor. And Iâ€™m a tiny part of that.\n\nQ: Did you have a relationship with the show growing up?\n\nA: No I didnâ€™t. The only time I ever watched it was when one Doctor became the other â€” the regeneration â€” youâ€™d read about it in the paper, and I would watch that. That really fired my imagination. The rest of it, because he sounded posh and reminded me of a headmaster from a private school, I thought, â€˜Naw, Iâ€™m not interested.â€™ My favourite show as a child, my favourite actor, was Patrick McGoohan in Danger Man and The Prisoner.\n\nQ: Oh man, Iâ€™m sure we could talk about The Prisoner forever. But Iâ€™m only going to throw one more at you. Iâ€™ve heard you say youâ€™d return to the Doctor role for the 100th anniversary in, what, 2063?\n\nA: That is correct, yeah. Oh absolutely, that is my aim â€” 2063, I will be 99. Wouldnâ€™t that be an achievement, eh? The Ninth Doctor bringing in the 999th Doctor, Nine at 99?\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: Thank you so much, I love what you said about the writers especially, and I know people canâ€™t always tell the difference between an actor and a character and writing, so Iâ€™m glad you touched on that.\n\nA: And can I say a personal thank you to you for watching The Leftovers, because we didnâ€™t get an enormous audience. But I feel in 10 yearsâ€™ time it will be seen as a little bit of a benchmark. HBO stood by that show, and now of course Damonâ€™s going to do Watchmen on HBO and Iâ€™m looking forward to that. Now and then people will stop and say I really loved The Leftovers and it gives me a lift.\n\nQ: Iâ€™ll continue to shout its praises from the rooftops.\n\nA: Cheers, pal.\n\nfgriwkowsky@postmedia.com\n\n@fisheyefoto\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
