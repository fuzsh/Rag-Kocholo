        "text": "I’m not going to write about Thatcher. Sorry. It just isn’t happening.\n\nAnyway, in this week’s list of Obvious Stories: Kim Jong Un isn’t too happy with South Korea, the Conservative government thinks too many people are on benefits, and Christopher Eccleston isn’t coming back to Doctor Who.\n\n“I never bathe in the same river twice,” is what Eccleston is supposed to have originally said – words that the current Doctor would do well to take seriously. The news that Eccleston had jumped ship was announced only a couple of days after the very first post-revival episode. It rather killed any sense of surprise over the rest of the series, which we now knew would probably end in a regeneration. (It was therefore lovely to watch ‘The Parting of the Ways’ with Thomas the other week, as he had no idea it was coming. Sometimes I think staying out of the media might do us all some good.)\n\nEccleston’s sense of discretion over the reasons for his departure has gradually eroded over the years. At the time, most of us figured it was because he was an established actor who wanted to avoid typecasting. Rumours abounded that the gruelling schedule had surprised him. He’s also been quoted in at least one making-of guide that he found the show’s formulaic writing somewhat tiresome, as the Doctor would solve a problem and then move on to the next one – in new circumstances with a new set of supporting characters – without anything ever really changing. There is an arc and a progression to the growth of the Ninth, for sure, but it’s hardly Aristotle, and I can see what he means.\n\nIt’s only comparatively recently that the (probable) real cause of his split from Davies and the Who clan has started to come to light, with accusations of bullying levelled against the management, specifically someone who is probably Euros Lyn. Doctor Who has never been the calmest of sets – in her biography, Elisabeth Sladen spends a great deal of time talking about the frantic rush to complete filming before the sets were due to shut down for the night, and a recurring theme on any 2 Entertain documentary is the fact that Doctor Who was given the same budget and shooting schedule as any BBC drama, despite the complications. Specifics aside, Eccleston certainly alludes to a less-than-pleasant working environment: there are two sides to every story, but whatever the truth of the matter I sincerely doubt things are ever as cosy backstage as the Confidential editions, magazine articles and sycophantic New Who guides (I’m looking at you, Gary Russell) would suggest.\n\nWhat is known is that Moffat got Eccleston into the studio for talks, and they went nowhere. So if the Ninth does appear in the anniversary special, it’ll be through the use of archived footage, as per normal. It worked for Tom Baker in ‘The Five Doctors’, although the writers of that were lucky enough to have a whole unaired story (all right, half of one) kicking around the vaults. There will almost certainly be a big press release with a couple of months to go announcing the appearance of all eleven Doctors in November, most of which will amount to three or four seconds of surviving footage for each incarnation, sandwiched between a lot of bickering between Rose and Clara. Crank up the Murray Gold, add a bit of emotional pathos (and a beach) and you’ve got yourself a winner.\n\nI was chatting about this with Gareth at the weekend. “Hmm,” he said. “I think I would almost be impressed if the the whole ‘Christopher Eccleston came in to talk to Steven Moffat, and decided not to appear in the anniversary show’ turned out to be ‘we secretly recorded just a short scene or two with him, and are covering it with a story about him coming in for a chat’. Maybe.”\n\nWhich would be sensational, of course. And if it happened, it would probably have gone a bit like this.\n\n—\n\nECCLESTON: I still don’t wanna do it, Steven.\n\nMOFFAT: Chris, I don’t know how many different ways I can say it. We need you. I need you. If you don’t appear, it’ll just be…I almost won’t want to film.\n\nECCLESTON: I don’t get this. I’m declining to appear in one tin-pot television series, and you’re treating it like…I don’t know…it’s the end of the world.\n\n[Moffat appears to tick something off on a clipboard]\n\nMOFFAT: Great.\n\nECCLESTON: Pardon?\n\nMOFFAT: I mean wait! OK, fair enough. It’s not the end of the world. But you can see why I want you, Chris. I’ve admired you for a long time. You’re the best at what you do. I saw your Hamlet. When it comes to Shakespeare, I think you’re the master.\n\nECCLESTON: The master? Really?\n\nMOFFAT [ticks]: Absolutely. But to get back to my first question –\n\nECCLESTON: I’ve lost track. What was the first question?\n\nMOFFAT [ticks]: – I’ll refresh your memory. Can you just say the line?\n\nECCLESTON: What line?\n\nMOFFAT: You know. The line.\n\nECCLESTON: Why do you want me to say the line?\n\nMOFFFAT: Oh, I just want to hear it, once more.\n\nECCLESTON: You really want me to say ‘Fantastic’?\n\nMOFFAT: Oh, say it again.\n\nECCLESTON: Fantastic?\n\nMOFFAT: Oh, lovely. Now once more. And can you look over at the green screen while you’re doing it?\n\nECCLESTON [sighing]: Fantastic.\n\n[Moffat does a little jumping up and down dance]\n\nECCLESTON: By the way, Steven, why are you dressed as a Slitheen?\n\nMOFFAT: Oh, just for old times’ sake.\n\n—\n\nYou’ll recall that yesterday I posted an image of all eleven Doctors in crochet form, along with a suitably knitting-themed Who-related title from a serial that I have yet to see (although I’m now told it features Martin Jarvis as the King of the Bumblebee people, so it’ll have to go on the watch list).\n\nThe source article for this photo contained “speculation” from a bloke calling himself Luke Smith who said that Doctor Who would be ‘rested’ after the fiftieth anniversary. “The BBC are getting tired of it”, he said (I’m paraphrasing and correcting his atrocious spelling and non-existent grammer; the original comments are probably still on there if you’re quick) “and they want to spend their money on other things”.\n\nMr Smith’s source for this nugget of information? A “mate” of his at Big Finish. When confronted with the accusation that BF aren’t in a position to actually know anything like this for certain, he backtracked and admitted that it was “a rumour”, which led to further ridicule. (He also didn’t help himself by asking why his previous remarks had been deleted, when in fact they had just been moved to the “further comments” bit.)\n\nSo he didn’t present his case very well, but it may well turn out to be true. Why shouldn’t it be canned? It’s going to happen sooner or later, and perhaps it should go out on a high, or at least have a break from Moffat’s relentless signposting, false leads and emotional companion-centred angst. Anyway, the funny thing is that if they were to do this it might actually do the show some good. For one thing, as Gareth pointed out, Big Finish would probably get some sort of temporary license to produce Ninth / Tenth / Eleventh Doctor material, which could be fun, particularly as the only way you’re ever going to get Christopher “Never bathe in the same river twice” Eccleston back into that TARDIS is if he can be standing in front of a studio microphone rather than a big flashy column and a doe-eyed Billie Piper. (I will probably be proved spectacularly wrong now, a theme to which we will return at a later date.)\n\nThe problem with having Eccleston on board, of course, is that he only ever travelled with Rose – she was with him until the end, and the only times she’s not at his side are during the temporary separations they experience in ‘Father’s Day’ and ‘Parting of the Ways’, when the Doctor’s preoccupied with other things. Indeed, the whole concept of Rose staying with the Doctor is a vital plot point to the season, as her frequent absences are a cause of friction with her family, and it’s not until Tennant’s put on his brown suit for the first time that this is properly resolved. More to the point, when we first meet the Doctor in ‘Rose’, he takes the earliest opportunity to glance at himself in a mirror, remarking on his physical appearance with “Could have been worse. Look at the ears!”.\n\nBut just a moment. That’s ambiguous. It’s ambiguous in a way that Smith’s comment in ‘The Eleventh Hour’ – when he refers to Prisoner Zero’s emulation of him as “rubbish; who’s that supposed to be?” – is not. The Eleventh Doctor admits that he doesn’t know what he looks like as he’s not yet seen a mirror, but we don’t know for sure that the Ninth Doctor is experiencing anything of the sort. It’s assumed that he’s only just regenerated – and indeed, Davies seems to have inserted this line precisely in order to avoid the flood of fan fiction that would otherwise saturate the internet, in which the Ninth Doctor travels with Victoria / Adric / Mel, but this territory-marking isn’t exactly airtight, the way that J.K. Rowling’s was.\n\n“This could easily be explained,” Gareth said, “by his recently having had a haircut – after all, the Eighth Doctor had longish hair, so maybe the Ninth did for a while. Clearly he finds the new haircut awful, and is thinking how much worse his appearance would be if he didn’t have impressive ears. So he’s thinking, ‘Phew! Thank goodness I have fantastic ears!’ Or maybe he’d just come from an adventure with a race of earless people, and he was just checking.”\n\nWhich makes so much sense I am now convinced it was the truth. And it opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Eccleston visiting the Sioux and acquiring the name ‘Grins Like An Idiot’. Travelling to America, having an adventure with Michael Knight (“Fine, it talks to you, but can it travel in time?”) and getting a leather jacket as a souvenir. Popping in on a family he once knew in Manchester and getting mistaken for the Messiah. (It would certainly explain the Tenth Doctor’s God complex.)\n\nThe only problem, of course, is that a long-haired Ninth Doctor looks like this.\n\n“I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together…”\n\nLast night, Joshua and Thomas and I watched ‘Journey’s End’. I say ‘watched’. The reality is that Thomas got bored and spent half of it doing headstands on the armchair. Joshua was taken aback by the regeneration that wasn’t, and then stomped around in a huff when there was no ‘next time’ trailer, although I think he was probably just upset about poor Donna.\n\nAs for me, I sat there bemoaning the melodrama in the last fifteen minutes: there’s an earlier, very telling encounter between the Doctor and Davros in which the Time Lord’s pacifist sensibilities are challenged, even if it is hampered somewhat by Dalek Caan behaving like Johnny the depressed artist from The Fast Show. And there’s the crowd-pleasing moment when Sarah Jane, cornered by Daleks, is saved by none other than Mickey Smith, holding an enormous gun. And then there’s that stupid, stupid scene on the beach. And lots of hugging. And then Tennant redeems himself by a final, wordless scene in the TARDIS when he looks genuinely upset at the departure of the Most Faithful Companion, and you remember that given the space that New Who rarely provides, he can turn in a fine performance.\n\nIt’s a missed opportunity, but it did get me thinking again about something I’ve been tinkering with for a while – a collection of those moments which have genuinely lived up to their promise, the moments that single out Doctor Who as first-rate television, the ones that make the clip shows and the award ceremonies. The ones that make you cry, or – in the case of the examples I’m about to provide – the ones that make you want to shout with glee. This is not a definitive list (hint: your comments welcome), nor is it exhaustive (there are plenty in Classic Who, and one of these days I’ll get to them). But here, in no particular order, are my top seven Doctor Who moments that make you go “Yes!”.\n\n—\n\n1. The Tenth Doctor saves the day (‘The Idiot’s Lantern’, series 2)\n\n“Goodnight children…everywhere.”\n\n—\n\nOnce upon a time, in the days before space-bound spitfires and silly dolls, Mark Gatiss wrote decent episodes of Doctor Who. This is the second (his first was ’The Unquiet Dead’, which I love), and the cracks are already beginning to show – there’s a lot of self-righteous cockney blustering and some absolutely excruciating dialogue between Rose and the Doctor at the beginning of the story. But in its favour, ‘The Idiot’s Lantern’ has Maureen Lipman, as well as sensitive support from Rory Jennings and Sam Cox, and one of the most exciting finales to any of the New Who stories. As the Wire gets on with sucking off the faces of the entire TV-watching population (the phrase ‘glued to the screen’ seldom seemed so apt), Tennant ascends the side of a transmitter in an attempt to wipe out the signal. There are obvious parallels with the ending of ‘Logopolis’ here, and that may have been the reason why, for the first time since 1987, I genuinely feared for the safety of the Doctor. You know it’ll all end well, and of course it does, but it’s a bumpy ride, and all the more satisfying when he inevitably triumphs – by capturing her on a Betamax cassette.\n\n—-\n\n2. The thing you never put in a trap (‘The Time of Angels’, series 5)\n\n“River, hug Amy. I’m busy.”\n\n—\n\nThe Angels have everyone surrounded. There are tons of them. They’re vicious killers, which is new. They also appear on video. Basically things don’t look good. The creative decision to have them speak was controversial but, unlike the other change Moffat made in these episodes, it worked – it did, if nothing else, help us to understand their malevolence. But they’ve made a mistake by trapping the Doctor, because there’s one thing you never put in a trap, and that’s him. This is the first cliffhanger episode and as such it’s the first time we see Smith’s Doctor well and truly cornered, so it’s nice to see him respond in this way. So good, even a dancing Graham Norton can’t spoil it.\n\n—\n\n3. The Doctor saves Caecillius (‘The Fires of Pompeii’, series 4)\n\n“I can never go back. I can’t. I just can’t.”\n\n—\n\nDoctor Who’s always been a bit awkward about predestination. Hartnell bleated that “You can’t change history – not one line” and it’s long since been the show’s ethos: basically everything the Doctor does is pre-ordained. Hence things happen in history because he’s there to stop them, not because he pops in to change them, and it’s the wisdom of being able to tell the difference between pre-ordained action and meddling that makes him the tedious demi-God that has he thus become in recent years. (It’s a quality that his companions – being human – singularly lack, which is why the Doctor presumably calls them ‘stupid apes’.) But in this instance, Donna is right: Pompeii happened, and it’s clear from this that it was supposed to happen, but there’s nothing in the history books about a mysterious stranger saving a random family because no one would have believed it. This makes the Doctor’s rescue – bathed in white light, beckoning Caecillius and his wife and children into it as if lifting them from the depths of hell – all the more plausible, and the moment when he changes his mind and goes back for them is really very satisfying indeed. Seldom has the sound of the TARDIS’ materialisation been quite so welcome.\n\n—\n\n4. The Doctor defies the Daleks (‘Bad Wolf’, series 1)\n\n“Rose? I’m coming to get you.”\n\n—\n\nThere are cliffhangers and there are cliffhangers. And then there’s this: a companion-in-peril moment that you expect to end in a look of abject horror, with a wide-eyed stare and a cry of “DOCTOR!”. Instead, Eccleston shows how, for all the arm-folding and grinning, he really was quite good at times: a Time Lord outmanned and outgunned and with no possible way he can win, but who is determined to go down fighting. The end result is goosebump-inducing. Accompanied by some of Murray Gold’s best music, the Doctor refuses to allow them the satisfaction of an easy surrender – and when he tells Rose’s captives the he’s going to rescue the girl, save the Earth and then, just for good measure, “wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky”, they believe him. And, crucially, so do we.\n\n—\n\n5. Rory grows a spine (‘A Good Man Goes To War’, series 6)\n\n“What happened to him? His voice finally break?”\n\n—\n\nA lot of people despise this episode. I think it’s a highlight of the sixth series, eclipsed in sheer brilliance only by ‘The God Complex’. The saga of the Doctor’s attempt to rescue Amy is muddled and confusing and refuses to explain why its supporting characters are there (only that they owe a debt to the Doctor, which Moffat’s no doubt going to come back to later), and there are ephemeral references to bow ties and the most ridiculously contrived (and thoroughly anticlimactic) ending you could imagine. But before any of that, there’s this: a stomping opening scene in which a captive Amy reassures her infant daughter that she’ll always be safe (Oh, Amy, if only you knew), because her father’s on his way. And Rory – wearing his gladiator costume for no really good reason, but let’s ignore that – stomps onto the bridge of a Cybermen warship, properly angry for perhaps the first time ever, and asks for the location of his wife. Never mind the ethics of the Doctor blowing up an entire fleet simply because he can – this is mind-numbingly good stuff.\n\n—\n\n6. “Everybody Lives” (‘The Doctor Dances’, series 1)\n\n“My leg’s grown back! When I come to the hospital, I had one leg!”\n\n“Well, there is a war on. Is it possible you miscounted?”\n\n—\n\nThe first Moffat Who story is a curious beast. It’s Jekyll / Hyde in nature, with a frightening, turbulent first half that features a strange, zombie-like child who can manipulate the telephone lines, and one of the most startling transformation scenes in the entire canon. And then, in part two, Moffat goes into zany screwball comedy mode. There’s an amusing denouement to the cliffhanger, when the Doctor frightens off the infected mob by telling them to go to their room, only to quip “I’m really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last words”. Then there are jokes about ears, bananas and the Doctor’s weapon of choice (“Who looks at a screwdriver and says ‘Ooh, this could be a little more sonic’?”). There’s a kind of infectious joy about it, despite all the end-of-the-world palaver, and it all comes to a head in this closing scene, which sees the Doctor save the day by thrashing his arms around in a display of literal handwavium, but the zero body count for the story is rare and refreshing, and even if much of the dialogue is corny, the sentiment is heartfelt and appropriate. “Just this once, Rose,” cries the Doctor triumphantly, “Everybody lives!” – and it’s hard not to cheer along with him.\n\n—\n\n7. The Doctor and Amy go exploring (‘The Eleventh Hour’)\n\n“Amy Pond, the girl who waited. You’ve waited long enough.”\n\n—\n\nYes, yes. I know everyone loves the fish custard scene, and that bit on the rooftop (“Hello. I’m the Doctor. Basically…run”). But my own air-punching moment came right at the end of this episode. It had been a dazzling tour-de-force from Smith, who spent an hour running around being manic and silly, in the days when Moffat’s scripts had him mostly doing that instead of acting sad and world-weary (which Smith also does very well, it’s just it’s less interesting to watch). So scrub to 2:44 and watch from there, because it’s the moment when you realise that even though he lets other things get in the way, Moffat still understands who he’s writing about and what the show represents. And when the Doctor announces, drily but with a wide-eyed gleam that he is, indeed, a madman with a box, I knew that Smith had nailed the part, and that I would love him. And I still do.\n\nOne of the Eleventh Doctor’s most endearing traits is a tendency to be very, very funny. This is not the same as having a sense of humour. More often than not he doesn’t actually make jokes: instead his quirkiness is manifest in strange non-sequiturs, off-the-cuff quips and the kind of aloof (but accessible) looniness that typifies many of the Cambridge graduates with whom I associate, which may explain why I like him so much. He’s on another level, and you can have a conversation with him, but you always get the feeling he’s going to be thinking about something else throughout – but somehow you don’t mind. It’s partly Smith, of course, but largely the writing, for which Moffat is chiefly responsible: most of the Doctor’s best lines seem to come from his penmanship, and I’ve often noted that irrespective of the overall quality of the episodes he didn’t write, I often find that I like the Doctor less. (Plus many of the best lines from the series, such as River’s Stevie Wonder gag, don’t even involve Smith.\n\nI’ll also admit that the catchphrases irritate me intensely. At first it seemed the Eleventh had eschewed them, but the use of “Come along Pond”, “Geronimo” and (most grating of all) “Bow ties / Fezs / Stetsons are cool” are something I’ve learned to tolerate rather than ever enjoy. It does, at least, beat the Tenth Doctor telling us that he’s sorry, so sorry, or the stupid arm-folding grins of Eccleston’s “Fantastic!” incarnation. The other thing the Eleventh does that I don’t mind is to repeat what he’s just said in the form of a question – “I think you noticed that, did you notice that?” – as if to reaffirm what he’s just said or check that everyone else is keeping up. By and large, though, catchphrases suck – lazy, comfortable writing – and while it may be nothing more than a personal preference, it would be lovely if we didn’t have to have them.\n\nAnyway, enough of my whinging: some of the highlights from Matt Smith’s two-year reign are presented below. I plundered Wikiquote and IMDB to bring these together, but eliminated anything I didn’t think was actually funny, irrespective of how good it was. As such, his line about being a mad man with a box – while one of the high points of that first series, as far as dialogue is concerned – is not here. There’s also a lovely moment in ‘The Rebel Flesh’ where the Doctor walks past the TARDIS, stuck at knee-height in the ground, and complains “Oh, what are you doing down there?”. Unfortunately such moments lose something in the telling, and as such are omitted. The rest of it, though, is rather amusing. At least I hope it’s amusing. Do you think it’s amusing?\n\n——\n\nThe Eleventh Hour (5.1)\n\nThe Doctor: I love yoghurt, yoghurt’s my favourite, give me yogurt.\n\n[Amelia runs, gets yogurt and hands it to him..\n\nThe Doctor: [Opens it, gulps it down then spits it out] I hate yogurt! Just…stuff with bits in.\n\nAmelia: You said that it was your favorite!\n\nThe Doctor: New mouth, new rules. It’s like eating after cleaning your teeth. Everything tastes WROOOONG. Ahhh! [body jerks in different directions]\n\nAmelia: What is that? What’s wrong with you?\n\nThe Doctor: Wrong with me? It’s not my fault. Why can’t you give me any decent food? You’re Scottish, fry something.\n\nThe Doctor: What sort of job is a kissogram?\n\nAmy: I go to parties, and I… kiss people. With outfits. It’s a laugh!\n\nThe Doctor: You were a little girl five minutes ago!\n\nAmy: You’re worse than my aunt!\n\nThe Doctor: I’m the Doctor, I’m worse than everybody’s aunt! [Turns to Mrs Angelo] And that is *not* how I’m introducing myself!\n\n——\n\nThe Beast Below (5.2)\n\nThe Doctor: There’s nothing broken, there’s no sign of concussion. And yes, you are covered in sick.\n\n——\n\nThe Time of Angels (5.4)\n\nThe Doctor: The writing… the graffiti: Old High Gallifreyan. [dramatically] The lost language of the Time Lords. There were days, there were many days, where these words could burn stars, raise up empires, and topple gods.\n\nAmy: What does this one say?\n\nThe Doctor: [hesitates, then, exasperatedly] “Hello sweetie”.\n\nRiver Song: OK. I’ve mapped the probability vectors, done a foldback on the temporal isometry, chartered the ship to its destination and… parked us right alongside!\n\nThe Doctor: Parked us? We haven’t landed!\n\nRiver Song: Of course we’ve landed – I just landed her!\n\nThe Doctor: But… it didn’t make the noise.\n\nRiver Song: What noise?\n\nThe Doctor: You know, the…\n\n[imitates Tardis noise]\n\nRiver Song: It’s not supposed to make that noise. You leave the brakes on!\n\nThe Doctor: Yeah, well, it’s a brilliant noise. I love that noise.\n\n——\n\nFlesh and Stone (5.5)\n\nFather Octavian: [asking about the Doctor] Dr. Song, I’ve lost good Clerics today. Do you trust this man?\n\nRiver Song: I absolutely trust him.\n\nFather Octavian: He’s not some kind of madman?\n\nRiver Song: [beat] I absolutely trust him.\n\n——\n\nThe Vampires of Venice (5.6)\n\n[Rory is at his stag party; music is playing; there is a paper cake in the middle of the pub. The men cheer for the “beautiful woman” to come out of the cake, however to their surprise the Doctor pops out instead. Rory shakes his head as he realises who it is.]\n\nThe Doctor: Rory! [feedback whines; music stops] That’s a relief! I thought I had burst out of the wrong cake. Again. That reminds me, there’s a girl standing outside in a bikini. Can someone let her in, give her a jumper? Lucy. Lovely girl. [whispers] Diabetic. [everyone continues staring at him] Now then, Rory, we need to talk about your fiancée. [Rory smiles] She tried to kiss me. [Crowd draws breath; Rory is visibly shocked] Tell you what though, you’re a lucky man; she’s a great kisser! [Glass smashes; Doctor realises what he just said, and looks visibly embarassed/ashamed] …Funny how you can say something in your head and it sounds fine.\n\nThe Doctor: She was frightened, I was frightened… But we survived, and the relief of it and… so, she kissed me.\n\nRory: And you kissed her back?\n\nThe Doctor: No. I kissed her mouth.\n\n——\n\nAmy’s Choice (5.7)\n\nAmy: Shall I run and get the manual?\n\nThe Doctor: I threw it in a supernova.\n\nAmy: You threw the manual in a supernova? Why?\n\nThe Doctor: Because I disagreed with it! Now stop talking to me when I’m cross!\n\n——\n\nThe Lodger (5.11)\n\nThe Doctor: I’m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor; I don’t know why. I call me the Doctor, too. I still don’t know why.\n\nThe Doctor: Have some rent. That’s probably quite a lot, isn’t it? Looks like a lot. Is it a lot? I can never tell. Don’t spend it all on sweets. Unless you like sweets. I like sweets.\n\nCraig: Where did you learn to cook?\n\nThe Doctor: Paris in the 18th century. No, hang on, that’s not recent is it? 17th? No no, 20th. Sorry, I’m not used to doing it in the right order.\n\nCraig: Has anyone ever told you that you’re a bit weird?\n\nThe Doctor: They never really stop.\n\nCraig: Listen, Mike and I had an arrangement where if you ever need me out of your hair, just give me a shout. [winks] Okay?.\n\nThe Doctor: [winks back] Why would I want that?\n\nCraig: Well, in case you want to bring someone round, a girlfriend or a…[looks at the Doctor up and down] boyfriend…\n\nThe Doctor: Oh, I will. I’ll shout… if that happens. Something like…I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS!\n\nSean: You are so on the team! Next week we’ve got the Crown & Anchor. We’re going to annihilate them!\n\nThe Doctor: [suddenly in Sean’s face] Annihilate? No! No violence, do you understand me? Not while I’m around, not today, not ever. I’m the Doctor. The Oncoming Storm. And you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn’t you?\n\nSean: Yeah.\n\nThe Doctor: Lovely. What sort of time?\n\n——\n\nThe Pandorica Opens (5.12)\n\nThe Doctor: There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior… A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.\n\nAmy: How did it end up in there?\n\nThe Doctor: You know fairy tales. A good wizard tricked it.\n\nRiver: [to Amy] I hate good wizards in fairy tales; they always turn out to be him.\n\nThe Doctor: How can you be here?\n\nRory: Ah, I don’t know. It’s kind of fuzzy.\n\nThe Doctor: Fuzzy?\n\nRory: Well, I died, and turned into a Roman. It’s very distracting.\n\n——\n\nThe Big Bang (5.13)\n\nAmy: You absolutely, definitely may kiss the bride–\n\nThe Doctor: Amelia, from now on, I shall be leaving the… kissing duties to the brand new… Mr. Pond!\n\nRory: No! I’m not Mr. Pond. That’s not how it works.\n\nThe Doctor: Yeah it is.\n\nRory: [looks at Amy nervously] …Yeah, it is.\n\n——\n\nA Christmas Carol\n\nThe Doctor: Don’t worry… fat fellow will be doing the rounds later. I’m just scoping out the general chimneyness. Yes. Nice sides, good traction.\n\n[Burns his hand on the mantle]\n\nThe Doctor: Bit tick.\n\nEric: Fat fellow?\n\nThe Doctor: Father Christmas, Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff.\n\nThe Doctor: Ooh, now what’s this, then? I love this! A big flashy lighty thing. That’s what brought me here! Big flashy lighty things have got me written all over them. Well, not actually, but give me time. And a crayon.\n\nYoung Kazran: Are you really a babysitter?\n\nThe Doctor: I think you’ll find that I’m universally recognized as a mature and responsible adult. [shows him the psychic paper]\n\nYoung Kazran: …It’s just a lot of wavy lines.\n\nThe Doctor: [looks at the paper] …Yeah, it shorted out. Finally, a lie too big.\n\n——\n\nThe Impossible Astronaut (6.1)\n\nThe Doctor: I’m your new undercover agent on loan from Scotland Yard. Codename: The Doctor. These are my top operatives, [indicates Amy, Rory, and River in turn] The Legs, The Nose, and Mrs. Robinson.\n\nRiver Song: I hate you.\n\nThe Doctor: No, you don’t.\n\n——\n\nDay of the Moon (6.2)\n\nCanton Delaware: What about Dr. Song? She dove off a rooftop.\n\nThe Doctor: Yeah, she does that.\n\n——\n\nThe Doctor’s Wife (6.4)\n\nAmy: She’s the TARDIS?\n\nThe Doctor: And she’s a woman! She’s a woman and she’s the TARDIS.\n\nAmy: Did you wish really hard?\n\n——\n\nThe Rebel Flesh (6.5)\n\nThe Doctor: I’ve got to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. [pauses] I never thought I’d have to say that again.\n\n——\n\nA Good Man Goes To War (6.7)\n\nCommander Strax: I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can produce magnificent quantities of lactic fluid.\n\nRiver Song: It’s my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the River Thames in 1814. The last of the great frost fairs. He got Stevie Wonder to sing for me under London Bridge.\n\nRory: Stevie Wonder sang in 1814?\n\nRiver Song: Yes, he did! But you must never tell him.\n\nThe Doctor: [to Melody Pond] It’s okay, she’s still all yours. And really you should call her “Mummy”, not “Big Milk Thing”.\n\nAmy Pond: Ok, what are you doing?\n\nThe Doctor: I speak Baby.\n\nAmy Pond: No, you don’t.\n\nThe Doctor: I speak everything. Don’t I, Melody Pond?\n\n[Melody makes gurgling noises]\n\nThe Doctor: [straightens his bow tie, self-assuredly] No it’s not. It’s cool.\n\n——\n\nNight Terrors (6.9)\n\nAlex: He’s scared to death of everything.\n\nThe Doctor: Pantophobia.\n\nAlex: What?\n\nThe Doctor: Pantophobia. Not fear of pants, though, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s the fear of everything. Including pants, I suppose, in that case.\n\n——\n\nThe God Complex (6.11)\n\nRory: Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have this overwhelming urge to notify their next-of-kin. [Rory flinches]\n\nAmy: What?\n\nRory: Sorry. Last time I said something like that, you hit me with your shoe. And you literally had to sit down and unlace it first.\n\nThe Doctor: You haven’t seen the last of me. “Bad Penny” is my middle name.- Seriously, the looks I get when I fill in a form…\n\n——\n\nClosing Time (6.12)\n\nThe Doctor: Oh, you’ve redecorated! I don’t like it.\n\nCraig: It’s a different house. We moved.\n\nThe Doctor: Yes, that’s it.\n\nThe Doctor: [playing with a remote controlled toy helicopter] It goes up, tiddly up! It goes down, tiddly down! For only £49.99, which I think personally is a bit steep. But then again, it’s your parents’ cash, and they’ll only waste it on boring stuff like lamps and vegetables. YAWN!\n\nCraig: [referring to his baby son] He’s called Alfie. And what are you doing here anyway?\n\nThe Doctor: Yes, he likes that … Alfie. Though personally, he likes to be called Stormageddon, Dark Lord of All.\n\nCraig: I’m sorry, what?\n\nThe Doctor: That’s what he calls himself.\n\nCraig: And how’d you know that?\n\nThe Doctor: I speak Baby.\n\nCraig: Of course you do.\n\nThe Doctor: [to Craig’s baby] No! He’s your dad! You can’t just call him “Not Mum”.\n\nCraig: “Not Mum”?\n\nThe Doctor: That’s you! “Also Not Mum”, that’s me! And everybody else is [gets near to hear baby] “Peasants”! That’s a bit unfortunate…\n\nJoshua and I differ in our love of Doctor Who in one respect: cliffhangers. I love them, and he can’t stand them.\n\nAge is part of it. The problem with each successive generation is that they expect things to be done faster. There is a certain amount of raw nostalgia in my recollection of the time – only a decade ago – when it would take me fifteen minutes to burn a CD. I can remember loading software from floppy disks. I can remember tapes. I can remember sitting in front of my Spectrum for ten minutes waiting for Chase HQ to finish loading, and cursing with all the swearwords an eleven-year-old could conjure when it crashed thirty seconds from the final block. I can remember having to rewind VHS videos that I’d left cued at the end credits of Superman IV. I can remember mail order services that took weeks, rather than days.\n\n(A friend of mine recently pointed out the semantic irony in that the universal symbol for saving is – of course – a floppy disk. When was the last time any of you actually used a floppy disk? These symbols arose because they fitted the times in which they were created, and this icon has now become so synonymous with its function that most of us, I expect, could never imagine using anything else. But paradoxically we’re raising a generation of children who need explanations of once self-explanatory visual cues like disk drives and gramophones and eight-tracks, explanations that I suspect we’re failing to provide, and – like the monkeys in the cage – many children have no idea why we use certain symbols, except for the normal explanation of “That’s just the way it’s done round here”.)\n\nThese days, I get grumpy when my download speed drops below 100K a second. I fire up a dual layer dub and look at the estimated time left and despair. I become frustrated when I place an Ebay order at eight in the morning and it doesn’t ship the same day, even though the terms and conditions said it would go within three. I drum impatient fingers when emails I’m telling people I’m sending while I speak to them over the phone fail to materialise instantly. I glance anxiously at the dashboard clock at every red light my Zafira encounters, and stare at my watch at every raised signal. I know that if you’re reading this you will be nodding in recognition at having done at least some of the above. We live in a society that enables us to do more than ever, if we want it, and somehow it’s never fast enough. What hope for us, and what hope for our children?\n\nSo perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised that Joshua wants instant resolution. When you’re a child the world moves slowly. I have an iPod app that counts off the sleeps until Christmas. Joshua starts asking me for the numbers in June, right after his birthday. When December 25th has been and gone, I am asked for the time that has to elapse until his birthday. We are trying to teach him the value of patience by making him wait for certain things. It is not working. And actually that isn’t true. I should say, rather, that it works inconsistently, depending on mood.\n\nI don’t tell him that the cliffhangers are coming, because when I do he spends the entire episode whinging “But Daddy, why does this one have to be a cliffhanger?”. And I’ve run out of patience because I always give him the same answer: “Because it just is. The writers found it necessary. And they thought it would make it more exciting.”\n\n“Oh, but I want to find out what happens next.”\n\n“Well, then, you’ll have to wait.”\n\n“Can you tell me?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Just give me one clue.”\n\n“Certainly not. It’ll spoil it.”\n\n“Come on, just one.”\n\nAnd so on, all the way down to the bathroom and beyond.\n\nHere’s the thing. I grew up with Old Who. That’s important, because it explains my current position, which is not altogether impartial. There are several hallmarks of Old Who that didn’t fully survive the transition: wobbly sets, frantic over-acting and the multi-episode cliffhangers. These days we have CGI, and ‘worthy’ performances that are usually relatively low-key, even if they’re less fun to watch (you may imagine that I found Phil Davis, in ‘The Fires of Pompeii’, an absolute breath of fresh air). As for the cliffhangers, that’s a problem with the episode structure in general: forty-two minutes, now, being the operative time to introduce everyone, tell your story and wrap it up.\n\nMost weeks it works, but there’s something missing. The pace is up, up, up: tight cuts, shouted explanations while Tennant or Smith is running down a corridor, and fairly bog-standard character development. It was notable that for Children of Earth, the third series of Torchwood, Russell T. Davies’ writing improved immeasurably: he elected to tell a single story over the course of five hours, a story that (crucially) could probably have been told in two or three with a bit of trimming. Free of the shackles of the standard runtime there was room for more reflection, more space, and pauses – the scene in which John Frobisher first engages with the 456, through a glass darkly, is the unquestionable series highlight, if only because it’s so – oh, just have a look, you’ll see what I mean:\n\nYou see? It’s jarringly slow (jarringly in the best of ways, because there are no lingering close-ups of Barrowman with tortured eyes and an obvious lump in his throat, under soft piano and strings). I wish I could have shown you the whole sequence, which consists of protracted introductions between Frobisher and the 456, with the sort of pacing that a bog-standard hour-long episode couldn’t accommodate.\n\nWhen it came to Who, though, something had to change come the revival: gone were the cliffhangers and multi-episode storylines, and instead you simply got in and got out. Because, according to the powers that be, audiences were fickle and couldn’t commit to the same thing week after week. (Anyone at the BBC who truly believes that has obviously never watched 24, The Wire, or Murder One.) As a token gesture we are given the series arc: a series of linked references to the finale, where cards are held close to Davies’ manly chest, and lots of rambling about the Bad Wolf or Harold Saxon.\n\nThen Davies jumped ship, and in strides Moffatt, who writes an entire season the way he used to construct episodes: the ontological paradoxes of ‘Blink’ are sustained for an entire season, with mixed results, and you really do have to watch every episode to figure out what the hell’s going on. In a way that’s an improvement, but it’s also needlessly convoluted. Everything is potentially significant, which means that nothing occurs at face value – there are all sorts of hidden meanings and codes and layers, and sometimes I just want to watch something entertaining without constantly rewinding to pick up on the significance of this or that. I’m difficult to please, I appreciate that. It’s more substantial than Davies’ soap opera, and yet unnecessarily so. There has to be a middle ground.\n\nBut there was a middle ground. It was called Old Who, and it worked quite well, thank you very much. In the series as it was once structured you’d have separate stories of between three and six episodes, with an obligatory cliffhanger every twenty-five minutes or so. Said cliffhangers were, to be honest, usually quite silly. Let’s be honest. Either the Doctor or a companion would be forced into some sort of life-or-death situation, cornered perhaps by a grisly monster, or about to fall a great distance (as Sarah Jane memorably did in ‘Genesis of the Daleks’, only for us to discover, the following week, that she’d only dropped about ten feet). The most effective cliffhangers usually involved the Time Lord himself, preferably in the presence of a female companion who could bellow “DOCTOOOOR!” at full blast just before the end credits rolled.\n\nThen they’d have a week’s grace period, and the resolution of said cliffhanger would typically be fairly naff. ‘Remembrance of the Daleks’ is a prime example: the sheer joy / abject horror of seeing a Dalek levitate, as its eye stalk zooms in on a terrified Doctor, trapped at the top of a staircase, makes it all the more tedious when an unconscious Ace manages to wake up and get the door open just in the nick of time. That’s the best they could have done? Really? A few years previously, ‘Mark of the Rani’ saw Colin Baker zooming down the Blists Hill incline towards certain death in a mine cart only to be rescued, rather incredibly, by George Stephenson (whose presence in the story is foreshadowed, but still, yawn).\n\nBut all that’s forgivable, really, because the whole point behind getting the Doctor into a sticky situation would be so that you’d worry about him, and worrying about the Doctor was what keeps the show going. It was something to talk about in the playground or over the water cooler, in the days when people actually did that instead of just discussing everything on Facebook. It’s not so much that you were worrying about whether he would escape, because you knew he would, but rather that you were trying to figure out exactly how he (or, typically, someone else) would manage it. The protagonists of shows like Doctor Who are granted a sort of unofficial immortality (in the case of Doctor Who, said immortality is even given its own name, context and rulebook) and there’s an unwritten law that states that their death must be given its own gravitas and significance, and cannot be shoehorned into a backed-against-the-wall-while-the-monster-approaches situation. Consequently, central characters would seldom die in cliffhangers, and the Doctor himself never really did (regeneration usually occurred at the end of an episode, but typically as the climax of a story, rather than as an ooh-what-will-happen-next type of thing).\n\nPerhaps that’s why I felt so let down by the end of season four, because it really felt like they were going to do something different for once, and actually regenerate the Doctor with no warning. And it’s not just the fact that it’s a crappy resolution, it’s the fact that it’s dealt with so rapidly (and yes, I know that it comes back to haunt us later with the Human Doctor, but THAT’S NOT THE POINT) and the fact that Tennant is so smug in the way that the Tenth Doctor always was when he was at his most irritating (which is right about now). And oh look, as if we needed any more shots of fawning Rose, here’s her looking upset. With teeth you could use to open beer bottles.\n\nIn contrast, New Who has thrown up a couple of spectacular two-parters, with cliffhangers that work by varying degrees of success – but this is my favourite:\n\nI mean, it’s bloody brilliant. Aren’t you getting goose bumps just seeing it again? The story as a whole is second-rate, but having the Doctor stand up to the Daleks (and comment pithily on his own resourcefulness with a single line of dialogue) is an extraordinary moment and almost worth waiting a whole series to see. It was the first time I truly believed in Eccleston as the Doctor, and he bowed out in the next episode, which is a shame.\n\nAnyway, here’s a quick summary. The traditional cliffhangers were usually fairly inconsequential. The resolutions were predictable or silly, in equal measure. All the same, it was a part of the show, as central and integral to its structure as the cliffhanger in a two-part Batman story. Again, those would see the dynamic duo tossed into a ludicrous situation that usually relied on Batman’s possession of an obscure gadget in his utility belt that would do the job quite nicely, thank you, and there was never any real doubt of their escape and subsequent victory at the end of the story, but altering the structure would have felt somehow cheap.\n\nI therefore miss the multi-part Who stories, and could frankly live without Moffat’s season-length meandering, with ‘clues’ that only a mindreader could spot. I’d just like to have him – the Doctor, I mean, not Moffat, although if he throws up another episode like ‘The Wedding of River Song’ I may reconsider – strapped to a table as a mad scientist tries to cut him open, or about to be fed into a compost machine, or dangling precariously from a wire by his umbrella (no, on second thoughts, let’s never go there again). It doesn’t matter how silly it is, because silliness is part of what made Classic Who so much fun. These days it’s far slicker, far more evenly structured, and almost doomed to implode from gorging on its own worthiness, but the change in format has, I think, made it lose a part of itself. Still, Josh is happy, so I suppose that has to count for something."
