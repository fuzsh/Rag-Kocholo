        "text": "Christopher Eccleston has joined the cast of 'Whispers of Freedom', a Cold War drama, from Golden Goat Films.\n\nThe Emmy winner Christopher Eccleston, that audiences might recognise as the ninth rendition of Doctor Who or as Malekith the Accursed from Marvel's Thor The Dark World, has lent his voice to an upcoming short film.\n\nWhispers of Freedom is based on the life of Chris Gueffroy - who was one of the last to attempt to escape from Cold War East Berlin.\n\nGuernsey Director, Brandon Ashplant, says Eccleston's voice will guide audiences.\n\n\"He is voicing the role of Herbert Köfer, he was one of the better known radio personalities in East Germany.\n\nHe is providing a bit of narration throughout, but is very much a character in the film as well.\"\n\nBrandon hopes the Eccleston's notoriety will gain traction for the project - which has mostly been filmed in Guernsey.\n\nHe says maintaining historically accuracy was important to him.\n\n\"Those of us who were born in the 90s or the early two thousands tend to think of the Berlin Wall - when Europe was literally cut down the middle by an iron curtain - as ancient history, but it is not.\n\nI want to shine a light on this part of history.\n\nWe've had support and historical consultancy from the Berlin Wall Memorial, the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship and the DDR Museum, who are sort of the gatekeepers to East German social history.\"\n\nThe project - which is partially funded by Guernsey Arts - has entered post-production editing, with a release expected in February next year."
