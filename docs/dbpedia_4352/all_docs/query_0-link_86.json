        "text": "Christopher Eccleston was the first modern Doctor Who. The timelord was absent from our screens for sixteen years before Russell T Davies revived it with Eccleston. He was better known for slightly harder material, just having come off the movie set of Danny Boyle’s Shallow Grave and Cracker (starring Robbie Coltrane). But paired with the teen singing sensation Billy Piper, the series became an instant hit.\n\nOn the run-up to the 60th anniversary, there was a whole host of cameos by former Doctors. Since Jodie Whittaker’s exit, David Tenant returned for three episodes before the torch was passed to Ncuti Gatwa. However, we’ve also seen David Bradley, Tom Baker, Paul McGann, Sylvester McCoy, and Colin Baker on screen. This has left fans wondering. Will Eccleston make an appearance?\n\nRELATED:\n\nEccleston called for the majority of the top team to be sacked before he would set foot on the set. Billy Piper has already made several appearances in the series since departing in 2006. She looked decidedly awkward sitting next to the former Doctor, as she said that she had no problem reprising Rose again.\n\nAlthough it looks like we can rule out Eccleston, fans could see Billy Piper back in the TARDIS."
