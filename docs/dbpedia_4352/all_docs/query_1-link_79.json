        "text": "Hollywood industry is full of glamour which is much more than what we see on-screen. While actors give their best to showcase their best performance in front of the camera, not everyone ends up with a great experience behind the scenes. Something similar was what Christopher Eccleston ended up facing when he worked with an A-list actress who almost threatened his acclaimed career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: “So can you arrange that?”: Christopher Eccleston Reveals His Brutal Conditions to Return as Doctor Who After His Public Fallout With Franchise\n\nThe 2 times BAFTA award winner has been an active personality in the TV and film industry who is better known for his role in Doctor Who (2005) and The Leftovers series. In a new interview, he felt haunted by his past due to an unpleasant experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher Eccleston Recalls His Uncomfortable Experience With A-List Actress\n\nAlso Read: True Detective Night Country Season 4 Episode 2 Release Date, Time, and Where to Watch\n\nThe Doctor Who star in a recent interview with The Independent UK recalled an uncomfortable experience when he was filming a s-x scene with an A-list actress. While he did not disclose the identity of the A-list star, he clarified it was not Nicole Kidman, with whom he worked in the 2001 movie, The Others.\n\n“I did a s-x scene with an A-list actress – not Nicole Kidman, who was brilliant – and she implied, in front of the crew, that I was copping a feel. Because she didn’t like me.”\n\nThe actress claimed that Christopher Eccleston made her uncomfortable in front of the crew based on animosity towards him. While this claim surely hit him with anger, he felt fortunate as “that happened to me before the Harvey Weinstein stuff came to light, so I wasn’t put in the stocks for it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he claimed,\n\n“But I’ve never felt more betrayed by a fellow actor than I did that day.”\n\nHe further compared putting his hands in a food blender to copping the actress to showcase the haunting experience he felt working with her.\n\n“I have to say to you that I would sooner have put my hands in a food blender than copped a feel of that person.”\n\nWhile this experience surely left an unpleasant memory in his mind, he further mentioned how this scenario could have been a bit different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher Eccleston Shared How Intimacy Coordinator is a Game Changer on Sets\n\nAlso Read: True Detective Night Country Season 4 Episode 1 Recap: Where are the missing researchers?\n\nEccleston further explained how his experience could have been entirely different had an intimacy coordinator been there on set. In the same interview, he continued,\n\n“I don’t think that would have happened with an intimacy coordinator on set.”\n\nHe further mentioned how things could have gone seriously bad for his career with that experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I could have been accused of all manner of things… that’s about what passes between actors, with trust and the abuse of it.”\n\nWhile he expressed his gratitude towards the intimate coordinators he has worked with on sets, he emphasized the importance of an intimacy coordinator on a film or TV set.\n\nAs per the actor, the intimate coordinators “can see where things could go wrong with them on set. It depends on the individual doing the coordinating, doesn’t it.”\n\nThey are the ones who help in managing the smooth operation of the intimate scene being handled professionally. While he acknowledges the skills required for the coordinator role, it all depends on how they approach working in their role."
