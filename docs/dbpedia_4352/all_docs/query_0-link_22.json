        "text": "Godsend\n\nPicking up two weeks after recent events, Nathanâs determination to save a comatose Peter forces him to turn to Simone for help. Isaacâs puzzling \"Hiro vs. T-Rex\" painting inspires Hiro and Ando to search for the pictured samurai sword. Jessica struggles against Nikiâs decision to turn herself in to police. With his associate Eden dead and Matt on his heels, H.R.G. tries to focus on his orders regarding Sylar. After being offered a choice by the Haitian, Claire struggles with changes her decision has wrought. Taking up his fatherâs quest, Suresh attempts to share information about who is \"on the list\" of people with special abilities and the threats to their lives. Meanwhile, a new hero (guest star Christopher Eccleston) makes a shocking debut.\n\nThe Fix\n\nChased by unknown assailants, Hiroâs search for the sword takes a turn when his father appears. A cleaned up Isaac dedicates himself to stopping New Yorkâs destruction -- and Peter. Claude, an invisible man with a mysterious past, might have something to teach a would-be hero. D.L. struggles with new family responsibilities as Matt opens up to his wife Janice. H.R.G. focuses on his murderous captive, Sylar. Meanwhile, after seeking out the Haitian, Claire secretly embarks on a search for her true birth parents. While working to find those on \"the list,\" Suresh receives a surprising visitor.\n\nDistractions\n\nHiro (Golden Globe nominee Masi Oka) struggles to make his father (guest star George Takei), a corporate tycoon, and ambitious sister (guest star Saemi Nakamura) understand his new heroic path in life. Niki (Ali Larter) has a chance to be with D.L (Leonard Roberts) and Micah (Noah Gray-Cabey) again, but will she really be with them? Claude (guest star Christopher Eccleston) attempts to teach Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) to harness his abilities, but the process could shatter Peterâs faith in those closest to him. Determined to find her birth mother (guest star Jessalyn Gilsig), Claire (Hayden Panettiere) makes her way to a trailer park in Texas. Meanwhile, Sylar (guest star Zachary Quinto) makes a shocking move against H.R.G. (Jack Coleman) -- and his family.\n\nUnexpected\n\nPeter (Milo Ventimiglia) painfully learns that someone close may have betrayed him and Claude (guest star Christopher Eccleston). Mattâs (Greg Grunberg) world spirals out of control when radioactive man Ted Sprague (guest star Matthew John Armstrong) and Hana Gitelman (guest star Stana Katic), a fierce young woman with \"wireless\" mental abilities, drop into his life. After blood is spilled, Hiro (Golden Globe nominee Masi Oka) makes a difficult decision about his mission. Claire (Hayden Panettiere) is unable to contain her anger at her father (Jack Coleman)."
