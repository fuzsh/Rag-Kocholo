        "text": "How old was Colin Baker when he played the Doctor?\n\nIt’s a slightly trickier question to answer than it looks at first glance. Do you mean when he was cast? When shooting began? His cameo in Androzani, or his first proper episode? Or maybe when his first episode was actually broadcast?\n\nThere isn’t much difference, admittedly. The answer is 40 (if you’re being sensible and don’t want months or weeks or days), but if you’re making an ordered list of how old the various actors were when they first played the Doctor, it does present a tiny problem. As depending on when you count, he’s older/younger than when Eccleston played the role (also 40, but 41 when his first episode was broadcast).\n\nHappily, the point of this particular list is less about worrying precisely when we should consider a Doctor’s tenure to have begun, and more about how I find it funny that David Tennant is now the third oldest Doctor. Third! Lols! …well, it amuses me anyway. Amuses, and fills me with existential dread about the passage of time. Hurrah!\n\nGiven that I’ve met Doctor Who fans, I want to put a long, long disclaimer at the start of the post: the information presented here is the result of a combo of Internet research (and there is plenty of reliable info on the Internet about Who, shush) and a quick flick though those lovely Howe-Stammers-Walker Handbooks from the nineties. All mistakes are mine and there are almost certainly mistakes. These mistakes may include, but are not limited to, counting the Doctor’s first proper episode rather than an end of episode cameo; and counting the first day of shooting an episode rather than the first day the actor was actually recording.\n\nThe important thing though – the very important thing – is that David Tennant is now the third oldest actor to have played the Doctor*. Remember that for your Doctor Who trivia quizzes. Don’t let anyone steal your point!\n\n*Oh God, by which I mean actor to have played the Doctor as a main role and not a guest or supporting part**. I both love and hate this fandom for this sort of ridiculousness.\n\n**But there are Bonus Doctors at the end anyway.\n\nThe Quick List (age at casting/shooting/broadcast date):\n\nWilliam Hartnell –
