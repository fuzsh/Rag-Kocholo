        "text": "“Five years is a big period, isn’t it? And there’s been a lot of changes in those five years.” Christopher Eccleston is musing on the subject of Maurice Scott, the bluff Cumbrian brewer who he has portrayed in the BBC family drama The A Word since 2015. He could, as he admits, be talking about himself: “Lot of changes in my life in those five years.”\n\nDivorce, a breakdown, suicidal thoughts, hospitalisation on a psychiatric ward and, last year, his extraordinary memoir, I Love the Bones of You, in which he opened up about his battles with anorexia, body dysmorphia and depression, as well as his late father’s dementia. A lot of changes.\n\nEccleston, understandably, feels he has had his say on those subjects. When I call him at home in north London we talk about other things: his love for Paul Scholes, his admiration for Daniel Craig, which parks we take our kids to for a state-sanctioned run about, the NHS, his mum. After the turmoil of the last few months, it is something of a relief to hear the actor back to his ebullient, passionate, thoughtful self, even if his modesty can sometimes run into self-criticism – on more than one occasion he describes his career as “lucky”, as if those performances in Cracker, Shallow Grave and Our Friends in the North happened by accident.\n\nWhen we speak, Britain’s luckiest actor (his words) was supposed to have been in rehearsals for the Channel 4 drama Close to Me. What exactly can a trained actor do in times of social-distancing and lockdown? “I’ve got a home-recording set-up. I’ve done some documentary narration, some audiobooks, I recorded a poem for the NHS. That wasn’t paid work, but it felt creative and like I was making a contribution. Actors can work from home, to a certain extent”\n\nIt is family, rather than work, on Eccleston’s mind, however. He worries for his mum, Elsie, 87 and alone in Salford, and for his children, Albert, aged eight, and Esme, six, who he co-parents with their mother and manages to see for five overnights per fortnight. They are, he says, untouched by the pandemic, “very happy, getting on with their lives.” Like Maurice, who Eccleston says “does the worrying for everybody else”, he does a bit of worrying for me too, enquiring about my sons, a toddler and a baby – who interrupt our chat more than once, which seems to delight him – and asking how they’re coping.\n\n“Two boys,” he says, tickled, “you wait till they're both on their legs, mate. I loved it when they were that age. Mine are six and eight now, so imagine the energy. I’m 56 and they want to wrestle, play hide and seek, fight, play tag. I’ve got to keep myself fit. I’m an older dad and I don’t want to miss out on any of that.” A doorbell rings, the toddler charges in, my wife follows, the baby cries. I apologise. “No, I get it,” chuckles Eccleston, “I get it. Excellent.”\n\nThe actor in isolation has also been learning and reciting John Cooper Clarke poems on Instagram – “to keep the mind ticking over” – but otherwise his lockdown life is much like ours. He makes sure he has his hour’s exercise outdoors, then does an hour of exercise at home, finding that “physical exercise, at a time like this, really helps me, mentally”. He’s been doing DIY, watching a documentary about OJ Simpson, reading a biography of Antonin Artaud, checking the news.\n\n“I check it as soon as I wake up. To see what the death rate is, really. Have the NHS got enough protective clothing? What’s the state of the care homes?” When we speak, Captain Tom Moore is in the news, having raised many millions for the NHS, a remarkable act of fundraising, but one that has raised questions about how the health service should be funded. “What he’s done is wonderful,” says Eccleston, “and it’s been great to see him walking around his garden. But I find myself thinking, why does the NHS need charity? If you’re in the NHS and you’re vocal about its funding, how do you feel when people start celebrating charity? Is the NHS as well-funded as it should be? What the f---’s going on? That’s what I find myself thinking.”\n\nThe A Word, which revolves around Maurice’s grandson, Joe (Max Vento), who has autism, has drawn praise, and occasionally criticism, for how it has dealt with the issues around learning difficulties. As well as Joe, Travis Smith, who plays Mark, is on the autistic spectrum, and Leon Harrop, who plays Maurice’s stepson Ralph, has Down syndrome.\n\nFor Eccleston, however, these aren’t “issues”. “It’s about ordinary lives, isn’t it. The day to day reality of a family, how they communicate or don’t communicate. I’m stopped so much by the public about The A Word. I’ve had two mothers who have stopped me and started talking about the series, in respects of their sons, and they’ve started to cry. There’s hope in the show. Life goes on when you have a child with autism, or a child with Down syndrome. I think they like that we’re not po-faced about it. They seem to feel recognised by the series, which is lovely. It touches people.”\n\nMaurice’s touching, no-nonsense relationship with Ralph is one of the cornerstones of the drama, and Eccleston credits Harrop with changing him as an actor. “Leon creates a different way of working. He doesn’t move towards us, we move towards him. When we’re filming, I sometimes look across and see Rick, the boom swinger, with a huge smile on his face, because he feels privileged to work with Leon. Leon’s free and he frees me up. His sense of playfulness, his being in the moment, his passion for it – it’s changed the way I act. We cynical old professionals are reinvigorated by Leon.”\n\nI ask what might come next in his career and Eccleston lists the writers Tony Marchant, Peter Flannery, Jimmy McGovern and Bowker as people he’d like to work with (again, in most cases). “But I’m aware that I’m a dinosaur. I’m 56, I’ve been in the industry a long time. Stories about men shouldn’t be at the centre of things anymore and hopefully the industry is changing. It gets a bit dull, doesn’t it? Tuning in and it’s a load of blokes again. I’ve had a good run of it, but things are changing. I’ll always be available for toxic male roles.”\n\nTalk of Flannery inevitably leads us to the seminal Our Friends in the North, the nine-part 1996 series which helped to boost the careers of Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong, while making a star out of the man who currently fills James Bond’s tuxedo, Daniel Craig. Would he like to revisit it? “I suspect Peter wants to leave it untouched,” says Eccleston. “I’ve not watched it for years. I remember feeling very lucky making it, partly because it felt like going back to drama school, because I played a character from the age of about 23 to 60. I look back now, at 56, and see how I portrayed a 60-year-old and I was way off-beam! I was portraying Nicky like he was in his 80s.”\n\nMy suggestion that the TV landscape has changed from the 1990s – the working-class McGovern and Eccleston have been replaced by the privately-educated Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Benedict Cumberbatch – gets a polite but firm rebuttal. “I don’t look back on it as a golden age,” he says. “We were in the minority then and we still are now, in TV and in theatre. It seemed to me then that Jimmy had to fight harder, Peter had to fight harder, to get their stuff on, than someone like Steven Poliakoff or the Merchant Ivory lot. What is clear is that it has got harder for actors from my background to get into the industry, which I didn’t think would happen.”\n\nAnd if Esme or Albert fancied a career in acting, what advice would he give? “I’d say to them that 90 per cent of actors are nowhere near as lucky as I have been. It’s a ridiculous career I’ve had. But I’d support them, which is was what happened with my mum and dad. They supported me.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, when I ask what he’ll do when the lockdown is lifted, his thoughts turn to his family. “I’d like to get my mum, Albert and Esme together, and I’d watch the three people I love most in the world interact. Have a picnic somewhere, surrounded by other people doing the same. I’m getting a bit emotional now. Just Albert and Esme. The future’s for them.”\n\nThe A Word will air from Tuesday May 5 on BBC One"
