Pentair PLC is exploring a sale of its slumping valves-and-controls business, a move that would largely unwind a merger deal it struck just four years ago.

Pentair is working with investment bank Citigroup Inc. on a potential sale of the business, which could fetch more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said.

It is unclear how advanced the sales process is and who might be interested. And as always, it is possible there will be no deal.

Pentair, which is based in Manchester, U.K., acquired the valves-and-controls business as part of a $4.5 billion deal with Tyco International Ltd. in 2012. The deal enabled Pentair to move its headquarters abroad, where taxes are lower. While the deal added other businesses, what Pentair is now considering selling represented a large part of it.

But the valve businessâ€™ results are weakening, with its sales down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter and its income falling 54%, in part because of declining energy demand. Executives have predicted an 8% drop in full-year revenue for the unit.

The business, one of four subdivisions of Pentair, makes valves, fittings and controls for machinery used by oil-and-gas, power and pharmaceutical companies. It has been hit by a slowdown in spending by energy-industry customers as a result of the sharp drop in oil prices.
