Pentair is an American company with multinational operations that specializes in water treatment and sustainable solutions. It operates in various sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure markets, offering a broad range of products and services. These include water filtration systems, pool and spa equipment, pumps, valves, and automation solutions to manage water quality and flow. The company is incorporated in Ireland, has its headquarters and tax residency in the UK, and is listed on the NYSE.

In 1966, Pentair was established in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, by a group of five friends who set out to build high-altitude balloons, a venture that didn’t quite get the results the founders had envisioned. However, the company rapidly diversified beyond its original scope in search of something more profitable and eventually found itself in the tool industry and with time, water systems and pool equipment. Over time, Pentair narrowed down its operations, eventually concentrating on water treatment and sustainable solutions, partly through acquisitions and partly by conducting spin-offs of various departments.
