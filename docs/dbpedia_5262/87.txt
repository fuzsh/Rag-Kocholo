The outright leader in swimming pools

PENTAIR is the world’s leading manufacturer of pool and spa equipment and accessories. We built our company so the pool professional and, by extension, the pool owner can secure all the best products from a single source…with the confidence and comfort that comes from single source responsibility and support.

PENTAIR has a genuinely global presence, occupying a leading position in the American market, as well as having businesses all over the world: in Europe, Latin America, China, South-East Asia, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East.

This dominant position as leader has not come about by chance and is the result of a specific strategy of mergers and acquisitions that has enabled PENTAIR to assemble some of the great brands in swimming pools: Pentair Pool Products®, Sta-Rite™, Onga™ and Kreepy Krauly®.
