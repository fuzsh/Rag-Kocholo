        "text": "Pentair Water Filtration will consolidate its Wisconsin office space at Bishop’s Woods office park in Brookfield, moving about 150 employees from Glendale and the company’s manufacturing plant in Brookfield.\n\nPentair has been looking for space for more than two years and has signed a lease for approximately 55,000 square feet, at 13845 Bishops Dr.\n\nThe space is currently occupied by Bader Rutter and Associates, which will be vacating in May to anchor an office building being developed by Wangard Partners at the former Laacke & Joys site in downtown Milwaukee.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“Our leadership and human resources team worked hard to find a location that was ideal for our employees and that had enough space,” said Kathleen Fugler, communications manager.\n\nIn addition to moving the staff, Pentair will be moving a state-of-the art laboratory that will take up about 7,800 square feet of space, Fugler said.\n\nThe company is hoping to occupy the new space by fall.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCurrently, Pentair office employees are located at 5730 North Glen Park Road in Glendale and 20580 Enterprise Ave. in Brookfield. The Brookfield location also includes the majority of the company’s Milwaukee-based manufacturing work, which has been expanded over the last year in anticipation of the move out of Glendale, Fugler said."
