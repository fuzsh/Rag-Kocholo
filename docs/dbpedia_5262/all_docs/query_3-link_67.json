        "text": "By of the\n\nPentair Residential Filtration LLC, a Milwaukee-based water technology company, on Friday announced an expansion into Latin America with the acquisition of a Brazilian manufacturer of filtration systems.\n\nPentair Residential, formed two years ago through the merger of the residential water-treatment subsidiaries of Pentair Inc. and General Electric Co., said it acquired Hidro Filtros do Brasil, which specializes in filters for both industrial and residential applications. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close early in 2011.\n\nHidro Filtros will be managed out of the Milwaukee headquarters of Pentair Residential Filtration, according to Alok Maskara, Pentair president.\n\n\"The acquisition of Hidro Filtros strengthens our position in the water filtration market in Latin America, a key growth region for Pentair,\" Maskara said.\n\nPentair said that Latin America ranks among the growing global markets for systems that treat, clean, conserve or recycle water. \"Pentair will be better positioned to support market trends and serve customers in Latin America through expanded channels, a stronger sales organization and local manufacturing capabilities,\" Maskara said.\n\nHidro Filtros' headquarters and manufacturing facility are in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The company employs 140 people and had sales of more than $12 million during the last 12 months.\n\nThe deal is significant in metro Milwaukee, where business leaders are working to position the region as a hub of water technology.\n\nEconomists believe water technology is a sector that's growing amid a global search for energy-efficient ways to clean, conserve, treat and recycle water.\n\nThe Milwaukee Water Council trade group was formed three years ago to prod growth among the region's roster of 120 water-technology companies. Data from Goldman Sachs shows that five of the world's 11 biggest water-technology companies, which include both Pentair and GE Water, already have operations in Milwaukee."
