The project, completed in May 2018, boasts offices, an employee lounge, machine shop and laboratory testing center. The unique lab allows for a variety of testing scenarios, in-floor sanitary drainage for testing stations, a reverse osmosis system, recycling and reuse of water, and multiple tanks that hold more than 15,000 gallons of water. Our crew dug more than 200 feet to accommodate a well with a minimum required pressure of 40 PSI to support a dozen high and low velocity pumps used for testing."
