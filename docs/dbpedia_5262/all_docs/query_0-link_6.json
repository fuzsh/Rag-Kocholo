        "text": "Region of England\n\nThis article is about the government office region. For the former European constituency, see North West England (European Parliament constituency).\n\nRegion in England\n\nNorth West England is one of nine official regions of England and consists of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,417,397 in 2021.[4] It is the third-most-populated region in the United Kingdom, after the South East and Greater London. The largest settlements are Manchester and Liverpool.\n\nSubdivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official region consists of the following subdivisions:\n\nLocal authorities County Combined authority or not Cumberland† and Westmorland & Furness† Cumbria N/a Cheshire East†, Cheshire West & Chester† and Warrington† Cheshire N/a Halton† Liverpool City Region Knowsley, City of Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral Merseyside* Bolton, Bury, City of Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, City of Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan Greater Manchester* Blackpool†, Blackburn with Darwen†, Burnley, West Lancashire, Chorley, South Ribble, Fylde, City of Preston, Wyre, City of Lancaster, Ribble Valley, Pendle, Rossendale and Hyndburn Lancashire N/a\n\nAfter abolition of the Greater Manchester and Merseyside County Councils in 1986, power was transferred to the metropolitan boroughs, making them equivalent to unitary authorities. In April 2011, Greater Manchester gained a top-tier administrative body in the form of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which means the 10 Greater Manchester boroughs are once again second-tier authorities.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth West England is bounded to the east by the Pennines and to the west by the Irish Sea. The region extends from the Scottish Borders in the north to the West Midlands region in the south. To its southwest is North Wales. Amongst the better known of the North West's physiographical features are the Lake District and the Cheshire Plain. The highest point in North West England (and the highest peak in England) is Scafell Pike, Cumbria, at a height of 3,209 ft (978 m).\n\nWindermere is the largest natural lake in England, while Broad Crag Tarn on Broad Crag is England's highest lake. Wast Water is England's deepest lake, being 74 metres deep.\n\nA mix of rural and urban landscape, two large conurbations, centred on Liverpool and Manchester, occupy much of the south of the region. The north of the region, comprising Cumbria and northern Lancashire, is largely rural, as is the far south which encompasses parts of the Cheshire Plain and Peak District.\n\nThe region includes parts of three National parks (all of the Lake District, and small parts of the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales) and three areas of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (all of Arnside and Silverdale and the Solway Coast, and almost all of the Forest of Bowland).\n\nWeather\n\n[edit]\n\nWeather in this part of England is typically classified as maritime, moist and temperate, with a moderate annual temperature range. Average annual precipitation in the UK typically ranges from approximately 800 mm to 1,400 mm. Temperatures are generally close to the national average.[5] Cumbria usually experiences the most severe weather, with high precipitation in the mountainous regions of the Lake District and Pennines. In winter, the most severe weather occurs in the more exposed and elevated areas of the North West, once again mainly the Lake District and Pennine areas.[citation needed]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation, density, and settlements\n\n[edit]\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics Mid Year Population Estimates in 2008[6]\n\nRegion/County Population Population Density Largest town/city Largest urban area Greater Manchester 2,629,400 2,016/km2 Manchester (510,700) (2012 est.)

During the Industrial Revolution hundreds of thousands of Welsh people migrated to the North West of England to work in the coal mines. Parts with notably high populations with Welsh ancestry as a result of this include Liverpool, Chester, Skelmersdale, Widnes, Halewood, Wallasey, Ashton-in-Makerfield and Birkenhead.[9][10]\n\nThe Mixed Race population makes up 1.3% (93,800) of the region's population. There are 323,800 South Asians, making up 4.7% of the population, and 1.1% Black (80,600). 0.6% of the population (39,900) are Chinese and 0.5% (36,500) of people belong to another ethnic group.\n\nNorth West England is a very diverse region, with Manchester and Liverpool amongst the most diverse cities in Europe. 19.4% of Blackburn with Darwen's population are Muslim, the third-highest among all local authorities in the United Kingdom and the highest outside London. Areas such as Moss Side in Greater Manchester are home to a 30%+ Black British population. In contrast, the town of St. Helens in Merseyside, unusually for a city area, has a very low percentage of ethnic minorities with 98% identifying as White British.[11] The City of Liverpool, over 800 years old, is one of the few places in Britain where ethnic minority populations can be traced back over dozens of generations: being the closest major city in England to Ireland, it is home to a significant ethnic Irish population, with the city being home to one of the first ever Afro-Caribbean communities in the UK, as well as the oldest Chinatown in Europe.[citation needed]\n\nEthnic group Year 1971 estimations[12] 1981 estimations[13] 1991[14] 2001[15] 2011[16] 2021[17] Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % Number % White: Total – 98.7% 6,580,840 97.5% 6,480,131 96.3% 6,355,495 94.43% 6,361,716 90.2% 6,347,394 85.6% White: British – – – – – – 6,203,043 92.17% 6,141,069 87% 6,019,385 81.2% White: Irish – – – – – – 77,499 64,930 61,422 0.8% White: Irish Traveller/Gypsy – – – – – – – – 4,147 – 5,741 0.1% White: Roma – – – – – – – – – – 7,359 0.1% White: Other – – – – – – 74,953 151,570 253,487 3.4% Asian or Asian British: Total – – – – 174,878 2.6% 256,762 3.81% 437,485 6.2% 622,685 8.4% Asian or Asian British: Indian – – – – 55,823 72,219 107,353 140,413 1.9% Asian or Asian British: Pakistani – – – – 77,150 116,968 189,436 303,611 4.1% Asian or Asian British: Bangladeshi – – – – 15,016 26,003 45,897 60,859 0.8% Asian or Asian British: Chinese – – – – 17,803 26,887 48,049 54,051 0.7% Asian or Asian British: Asian Other – – – – 9,086 14,685 46,750 63,751 0.9% Black or Black British: Total – – – – 47,478 0.7% 41,637 0.61% 97,869 1.38% 173,918 2.3% Black or Black British: African – – – – 9,417 15,912 59,278 126,608 1.7% Black or Black British: Caribbean – – – – 21,763 20,422 23,131 25,919 0.3% Black or Black British: Other – – – – 16,298 5,303 15,460 21,391 0.3% Mixed: Total – – – – – – 62,539 0.92% 110,891 1.57% 163,245 2.1% Mixed: White and Caribbean – – – – – – 22,119 39,204 46,962 0.6% Mixed: White and African – – – – – – 9,853 18,392 30,011 0.4% Mixed: White and Asian – – – – – – 17,223 30,529 47,829 0.6% Mixed: Other Mixed – – – – – – 13,344 22,766 38,443 0.5% Other: Total – – – – 24,373 0.4% 13,331 0.19% 44,216 0.62% 110,156 1.5% Other: Arab – – – – – – – – 24,528 43,865 0.6% Other: Any other ethnic group – – – – 24,373 0.4% 13,331 0.19% 19,688 66,291 0.9% Non-White: Total – 1.3% 168,695 2.5% 246,729 3.7% 374,269 5.6% 690,461 9.8% 1,070,004 14.4% Total – 100% 6,749,535 100% 6,726,860 100% 6,729,764 100% 7,052,177 100% 7,417,398 100%\n\nPlace of birth\n\n[edit]\n\nThe table below is not how many people belong to each ethnic group (e.g. a BBC News article in 2008 claimed there are over 25,000 ethnic Italians in Manchester alone whilst only 6,000 Italian-born people live in the North West).[18] The proportion of people residing in North West England born outside the UK was 11.7% in 2021, compared with 8.2% in 2011 and 5.1% in 2001.

Despite this the region has above average multiple deprivation with wealth heavily concentrated on very affluent areas like rural Cheshire, rural Lancashire, and south Cumbria. As measured by the Indices of deprivation 2007, the region has many more Lower Layer Super Output Areas in the 20% most deprived districts than the 20% least deprived council districts.[28] Only North East England shows more indicators of deprivation than the North West, but the number of affluent areas in the North West is very similar to Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\nThe most deprived local authority areas in the region (based on specific wards within those borough areas) are, in descending order—Liverpool, Manchester, Knowsley, Blackpool, Salford, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Rochdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Halton, Hyndburn, Oldham, Pendle, St Helens, Preston, Bolton, Tameside, Wirral, Wigan, Copeland, Sefton, and Rossendale.\n\nIn 2007 when Cheshire still had district councils, the least deprived council districts in the region by council district, in descending order, were—Congleton, Ribble Valley, Macclesfield, and South Lakeland.[29] These areas have Conservative MPs, except South Lakeland has a Lib Dem and Labour MPs. At county level, before it was split into two, Cheshire was the least deprived, followed by Trafford, and by Warrington and Stockport.\n\nIn March 2011, the overall unemployment claimant count was 4.2% for the region. Inside the region the highest was Liverpool with 6.8%, followed by Knowsley on 6.3%, Halton with 5.5% and Rochdale with 5.1%. The lowest claimant count is in Eden (Cumbria) and Ribble Valley (Lancashire) each with 1.3%, followed by South Lakeland with 1.4%.[30]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2019 general election, the Conservatives gained ten seats, from the Labour Party, with no other seats changing hands. Labour held 42 of their 52 seats, albeit many with slimmed down majorities. They remain the dominant party in the region by seat count, with the Conservatives total now standing at 27. The Conservatives made two gains in Cheshire, three gains in Lancashire, five gains in Greater Manchester, notably including Andy Burnham's former seat of Leigh.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, the area was dominated by the Labour Party. Fifty-five per cent of the region's electorate voted Labour, 36.3% Conservative, 5.4% Liberal Democrat, 1.9% UKIP and 1.1% Greens; however, by number of parliamentary seats, Labour have 54, the Conservatives have 20, and the Liberal Democrats have 1. The Lib Dems' North West seat is in south Cumbria; Labour dominates Greater Manchester, and the Conservatives' vote is concentrated in affluent suburban areas such as Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Altrincham and Sale West. Labour seats also predominate in Merseyside. In Cheshire the 2015 result was reversed, with Labour winning seven seats and the Conservatives four, whilst Lancashire is competitive between Labour and Conservative (8 seats each); the Labour seats in Lancashire are concentrated in the south of the county along the M65. For the region, the Labour gained 3 seats; there was a 5.2% swing from Conservative to Labour.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Liverpool Walton was the safest seat in the UK, with a 72% majority, and in 2017 this was repeated with a 77% majority for Dan Carden (Labour), when an astonishing 85.7% of the electorate voted for him (the Conservatives came second with 8.6%). In the by-election of 2012, Manchester Central has the record for the lowest turnout in the UK—18%. Gwyneth Dunwoody, for Crewe and Nantwich, was the longest serving female MP until her death in 2008.\n\nIn the final European Elections in the UK in 2019, 31.23% voted for the Brexit Party, with Labour polling 21.91%, the Liberal Democrats 17.15% and the Green Party 12.48%. The Conservatives came fifth in the region with 7.55% of votes cast.[31]\n\nLanguage and dialect\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest known language spoken in the North West was a dialect of the Brythonic language spoken across much of Britain from at least the Iron Age up to the arrival of English in the first millennium AD. Fragments of this early language are seen in the inscriptions and place names of the Roman era. In some parts of the region, the Brythonic dialect developed into the medieval language known today as Cumbric, which continued to be spoken perhaps as late as the 12th century in the north of Cumbria. This early Celtic heritage remains today in place names such as Carlisle, Penrith and Eccles, and many river names such as Cocker, Kent and Eden.\n\nEnglish may have been spoken in the North West from around the 7th century AD, when the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria first appears to have made inroads west of the Pennines. The language at this time would have been the Northumbrian dialect of Old English. The high percentage of English place names in the region as a whole suggests English became almost ubiquitous over the coming centuries, particularly in the area south of the Lake District. Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Blackburn and Preston are among the region's many English place names. In the 9th to the 11th centuries, Danes from the east and Norsemen from Ireland and Scotland began settling in the area. The North West is really the only area of England where Norse settlement was significant and their influence remains in the place names and dialect of the region. Elements like fell, thwaite and tarn, which are particularly common in Cumbria, are all Norse. The numerous Kirkbys and place names with \"holm\" and \"dale\" show the Scandinavian influence throughout the North West.\n\nThrough the Middle Ages the dialects of the North West would have been considerably different from those spoken in the Midlands and south. It was only with the spread of literacy (particularly with the publication of the King James Bible) that Standard English spread to the region. Even so, local dialects continued to be used and were relatively widespread until the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn modern times, English is the most spoken language in the North West, with a large percentage of the population fluent in it, and close to 100% conversational in it. To the north-east of the region, within the historic boundaries of Cumberland, the Cumbrian dialect is dominant. The historical county of Lancashire covered a vast amount of land, and the Lancashire dialect and accent is still predominant throughout the county, and stretches as far north as Furness in South Cumbria to parts of north Greater Manchester and Merseyside in the south of the region. The region boasts some of the most distinctive accents in the form of the Scouse accent, which originates from Liverpool and its surrounding areas, and the Manc accent, deriving from the central Manchester district. Both of these descend from the Lancashire dialect but have some distinctions from it, especially Scouse. The region's accents are among those referred to as 'Northern English'.\n\nLarge immigrant populations in the North West result in the presence of significant immigrant languages. South Asian languages such as Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi are widespread, with the largest number of speakers residing in Preston, Blackburn and Manchester. The Chinese once made up the largest minority in the region (as Liverpool has one of the oldest Chinese settlements in Europe), and still do to the far north where Chinese is spoken by small but significant communities. Since the enlargement of the EU, over one million Poles have immigrated to the UK, a large number of them settling in the North West. Places such as Crewe as well as larger cities make Polish written information available for the public, to much controversy. Other immigrant languages with a presence in the North West are Spanish, mainly amongst the Latin American communities in Liverpool and Manchester,[citation needed] as well as various other Eastern European and Asian languages.\n\nThe most taught languages in schools across the North West are English, French and Spanish. German and Italian are available at more senior levels and, in cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, even Urdu and Mandarin are being taught to help maintain links between the local minority populations.[citation needed]\n\nEurostat NUTS\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), North West is a level-1 NUTS region, coded \"UKD\", which (since 2015) is subdivided as follows:[32][33]\n\nNUTS 1 Code NUTS 2 Code NUTS 3 Code North West UKD Cumbria UKD1 West Cumbria (Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Copeland) UKD11 East Cumbria (Carlisle, Eden, South Lakeland) UKD12 Cheshire UKD6 Warrington UKD61 Cheshire East UKD62 Cheshire West and Chester UKD63 Greater Manchester UKD3 Manchester UKD33 Greater Manchester South West (Salford and Trafford) UKD34 Greater Manchester South East (Stockport and Tameside) UKD35 Greater Manchester North West (Bolton and Wigan) UKD36 Greater Manchester North East (Bury, Oldham and Rochdale) UKD37 Lancashire UKD4 Blackburn with Darwen UKD41 Blackpool UKD42 Lancaster and Wyre UKD44 Mid Lancashire (Fylde, Preston, Ribble Valley and South Ribble) UKD45 East Lancashire (Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale) UKD46 Chorley and West Lancashire UKD47 Merseyside UKD7 East Merseyside (Knowsley, St. Helens and Halton) UKD71 Liverpool UKD72 Sefton UKD73 Wirral UKD74\n\nCities and towns\n\n[edit]\n\nGM=Greater Manchester\n\nME=Merseyside\n\nCU=Cumbria\n\nLA=Lancashire\n\nCH=Cheshire\n\nPopulation > 400,000\n\nManchester, GM\n\nLiverpool, ME\n\nPopulation > 100,000\n\nWarrington, CH\n\nBlackpool, LA\n\nChester, CH\n\nStockport, GM\n\nSale, GM\n\nBolton, GM\n\nPreston, LA\n\nRochdale, GM\n\nBlackburn, LA\n\nWigan, GM\n\nSt. Helens, ME\n\nWythenshawe, GM\n\nSalford, GM\n\nPopulation > 70,000\n\nOldham, GM\n\nSouthport, ME\n\nBirkenhead, ME\n\nBury, GM\n\nBootle, ME\n\nCarlisle, CU\n\nNorthwich, CH\n\nBurnley, LA\n\nBarrow-in-Furness, CU\n\nCrewe, CH\n\nPopulation > 50,000\n\nRuncorn, CH\n\nWidnes, CH\n\nWallasey, ME\n\nEllesmere Port, CH\n\nAltrincham, GM\n\nMacclesfield, CH\n\nCrosby, ME\n\nLeigh, GM\n\nPopulation > 30,000\n\nAccrington, LA\n\nLancaster, LA\n\nAshton-under-Lyne, GM\n\nMiddleton, GM\n\nLytham St Annes, LA\n\nUrmston, GM\n\nKirkby, ME\n\nSkelmersdale, LA\n\nEccles, GM\n\nStretford, GM\n\nDenton, GM\n\nLeyland, LA\n\nChadderton, GM\n\nMorecambe, LA\n\nChorley, LA\n\nHyde, GM\n\nHuyton, ME\n\nThornton-Cleveleys, LA\n\nPrestwich, GM\n\nSaddleworth, GM\n\nWinsford, CH\n\nFarnworth, GM\n\nPopulation > 20,000\n\nRadcliffe, GM\n\nNelson, LA\n\nAshton-in-Makerfield, GM\n\nKendal, CU\n\nHeywood, GM\n\nReddish, GM\n\nDarwen, LA\n\nHindley, GM\n\nCheadle Hulme, GM\n\nFleetwood, LA\n\nCongleton, CH\n\nSwinton, GM\n\nWorkington, CU\n\nSouth Turton, GM\n\nWesthoughton, GM\n\nWilmslow, CH\n\nOrmskirk, LA\n\nGolborne, GM\n\nWhitehaven, CU\n\nStalybridge, GM\n\nMarple, GM\n\nWhitefield, GM\n\nDroylsden, GM\n\nPenwortham, LA\n\nFormby, ME\n\nLitherland, ME\n\nNewton-le-Willows, ME\n\nAtherton, GM\n\nRawtenstall, LA\n\nRoyton, GM\n\nWalkden, GM\n\nShaw and Crompton, GM\n\nFailsworth, GM\n\nMaghull, ME\n\nHalewood, ME\n\nHorwich, GM\n\nPopulation > 10,000\n\nAlsager, CH\n\nBramhall, GM\n\nClitheroe, LA\n\nColne, LA\n\nDukinfield, GM\n\nHaslingden, LA\n\nHazel Grove, GM\n\nHeysham, LA\n\nIrlam, GM\n\nLowton, GM\n\nMaryport, CU\n\nMoreton, ME\n\nNantwich, CH\n\nNeston, CH\n\nPendlebury, GM\n\nPenrith, CU\n\nPoulton-le-Fylde, LA\n\nRamsbottom, GM\n\nRomiley, GM\n\nSandbach, CH\n\nTyldesley, GM\n\nUlverston, CU\n\nUpton, ME\n\nWoodley, GM\n\nPopulation > 5,000\n\nBurscough, LA\n\nCarnforth, LA\n\nCleator Moor, CU\n\nCockermouth, CU\n\nDalton-in-Furness, CU\n\nFrodsham, CH\n\nGatley, GM\n\nMillom, CU\n\nTarleton, LA\n\nWindermere, CU\n\nMetropolitan areas\n\n[edit]\n\nThe five largest metropolitan areas in the North West are as follows:\n\nGreater Manchester metropolitan area – 2,556,000[34]\n\nLiverpool/Birkenhead metropolitan area – 2,241,000[34]\n\nBlackburn/Burnley – 391,000[34]\n\nPreston – 354,000[34]\n\nBlackpool −304,000[34]\n\nLiverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered parts of a single large polynuclear metropolitan area,[35][36][37] or megalopolis but are usually treated as separate metropolitan areas.[34] In some studies, part of Wigan in Greater Manchester is considered part of the Liverpool metropolitan area.[34]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe North West of England has historically been held by the Labour Party.\n\nNational politics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party won a plurality of seats in the North West.\n\nElected regional assembly\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is one of the two regions (along with Yorkshire and the Humber) that were expected to hold a referendum on the establishment of an elected regional assembly. However, when the North East region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, further referendums were cancelled and the proposals for elected regional assemblies in England put on hold. The regional leaders' forum, 4NW is based on Waterside Drive in Wigan.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\nThe former North West England European Parliament constituency had the same boundaries as the Region.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTen English regions were established by the government in 1994. At that time, Merseyside, which already had its own Government Office, formerly the Merseyside Task Force, was regarded as a separate region. In 1998, Merseyside was merged into the North West region. This action was controversial in some quarters.[38] Regional Government Offices were abolished in April 2011 by the Coalition Government.\n\nScientific heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nSir Ernest Marsden (of Blackburn) and Hans Geiger conducted the Geiger–Marsden experiment at the University of Manchester in 1909, where the Geiger counter was invented, which demonstrated the existence of the atomic nucleus. Sir J. J. Thomson of Cheetham Hill discovered the electron (given its name in 1891 by George Johnstone Stoney) in April 1897 and received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906; his son George Paget Thomson would win the Nobel Prize for Physics 1937 for discovering electron diffraction (at the University of Aberdeen). John Dalton, from Cumbria and moved to Manchester, developed atomic theory. William Sturgeon of Lancashire invented the electromagnet in 1825.\n\nSydney Chapman, a mathematician from Eccles, in 1930 explained the ozone–oxygen cycle in the stratosphere, being the first to propose that atmospheric oxygen or ozone molecules absorb (harmful UVB and UVC) ultraviolet wavelengths of light in photolysis, to produce reactive single atoms which accumulate to form the ozone layer.\n\nGraphene was discovered at the University of Manchester in 2004 under Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov.\n\nAt the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson discovered polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and also known as Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene, the fabric that is now referred to as polyester. ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Michael Perrin.\n\nHalothane, the world's first synthetic inhalation general anaesthetic gas, was discovered in 1951 at ICI's Widnes Laboratory by Wallasey's Charles Suckling, and first tested on a patient in Manchester in 1956; it works by binding to the GABA receptor. John Charnley of Bury invented the hip replacement in 1962 at Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, north-west of Wigan. Clatterbridge Hospital in Bebington has a cyclotron (linear accelerator), and is the only hospital in the UK to offer proton therapy.\n\nAlderley Park opened in October 1957, and ICI Pharmaceuticals was formed in the same year. In 1962 Dora Richardson of ICI discovered tamoxifen. ICI Alderley Park later discovered Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, Goserelin and Bicalutamide, later made by Zeneca. James Black discovered beta blockers—propranolol (Inderal) at Alderley Park in 1962. The Wellcome Foundation, a provider of much of Britain's medical research, was based from 1966 to 1997 at Crewe Hall in Crewe Green.\n\nClifford Cocks and James H. Ellis from Cheshire, with Malcolm J. Williamson, invented the RSA (algorithm) in 1973 at GCHQ, used for public-key cryptography. Richard Owen from Lancaster coined the word dinosaur in 1842, and he founded the Natural History Museum, London, opening in 1881.\n\nIndustrial heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Liverpool & Manchester Railway was the world's first passenger inter-city railway in 1830. Manchester Liverpool Road railway station is the world's oldest surviving railway station, having opened on 15 September 1830; the Stockton & Darlington Railway had opened in 1825. Chat Moss was a problem to constructing the railway, with Edge Hill Tunnel and Sankey Viaduct; the line was bitterly opposed by William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. The Bridgewater Canal was the first recognised canal of the modern era. Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater had visited France and noted their canals. John Gilbert had the innovative idea to use water pumped out of his coal mines to fill a canal from the Duke's Worsley mines to Manchester. It was designed by James Brindley and built in 1761.\n\nThe Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft (Salford), can claim to be the world's first factory with an assembly line type arrangement in 1836. Joseph Huddart of Cumbria was the first to mechanise the production of rope in 1793. The spinning jenny was invented in 1764 in Lancashire by James Hargreaves, a mechanical advance on the spinning wheel.\n\nSee also: History of computing hardware\n\nThe University of Manchester built the world's first programmable computer, the Manchester Baby, on 21 June 1948; the Williams–Kilburn tube on the machine was the world's first computer memory, and the beginning of random-access memory (RAM); the baby computer was made from 550 Mullard valves. The first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, was made in Manchester and sold in February 1951 to the University of Manchester. The world's first transistor computer was the Manchester Transistor Computer in November 1953. Atlas was another important computer developed at the University of Manchester, largely developed by Tom Kilburn; at the time in 1962 it was most powerful computer in the world. The government had dropped its financial support of this computer, and was only funded by Ferranti—the total development cost was around £1m. Britain was leading the world at this time in computing, with the only main competitor being IBM; after the mid-1950s America took over the industry. The spreadsheet was invented in 1974, known as the Works Record System, and used an Adabas database on an IBM 3270 at ICI in Northwich; it was developed by Robert Mais and it was around four years before (the more well-known) VisiCalc in 1978. The University of Manchester has collected 25 Nobel prizes, though recent years have been less notable.\n\nParsonage Colliery at Leigh had the UK's deepest mine—1,260 metres in 1949. Macclesfield was the base of UK's silk weaving industry. John Benjamin Dancer of Manchester invented microphotography in 1839, which would lead to microform in the 1920s. Frank Hornby from Liverpool invented Meccano in 1901, where Meccano Ltd would be based for over 60 years. Bryant & May's site in Garston was the last wooden match factory in the UK, closing in 1994 to become The Matchworks business centre off the A561 west of the former Speke airport. Cottonopolis was the industrial name for Manchester and the local area. Manchester at one time was the world's richest city. The CIS Tower, built by John Laing in 1962, was Europe's tallest building, and Britain's tallest building until 1963, and Manchester's tallest building until 2006.\n\nKirkby was planned in the 1950s as the largest trading estate in Britain—1,800 acres. Trafford Park is the world's first planned industrial estate. Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers opened their first co-operative outlet on 21 December 1844.\n\nAlastair Pilkington invented the float glass method of manufacture in 1957 at St Helens, announcing it in January 1959. It was manufactured from 1961, and 80% of the world's glass is made with the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world's first registered brand, and world's oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the arc lamp. Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought to make the best quality rail track in the world.\n\nSee also: War of the currents and Mains electricity\n\nSebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an electrical engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station in the world in 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain's defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti's design of increasing AC voltage to high tension at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all electricity networks take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of electricity transmission cables.\n\nThe Chain Home radar transmitters were built by Metrovick at its Trafford Park Works, which became part of AEI in 1929, GEC in 1968, and as Alstom it was closed in June 2000. 2ZY, the first broadcasts in the north of England, were made from the Metrovick factory in November 1922, which became part of the BBC National Programme in 1927. GEC opened its first factory in Manchester in 1888, moving to Salford in 1895 at the Peel Works, and had built the Osram electric light company in 1893. The Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 of Trafford Park Works, Manchester was the first axial-flow jet engine, with a nine-stage compressor, first running in 1941. It would end up as the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire and the American-built Wright J65. The F.2 gas turbine would power MGB.2009 the first gas-turbine-powered vessel in 1947. No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF—the main parachute training site for the war—was at RAF Ringway (the Central Landing Establishment and Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment) now Manchester Airport; many aircraft were built there too, and the Ford Trafford Park Factory built 34,000 aircraft engines—mostly Merlin engines; the nearby Metropolitan-Vickers factory built many Lancasters.\n\nCalder Hall was the world's first nuclear power station in 1956. There are approximately 430 nuclear power stations around the world, and the UK is the third most experienced operator of nuclear reactors after the US and France, and is the world's ninth largest producer of nuclear-generated electricity, with nine stations operating in the UK producing around 10GW. New-build nuclear power stations will either be the AP1000 (Toshiba Westinghouse NuGeneration) or EPR design (developed by Areva). BNFL bought Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Company in 1999; it was sold in October 2006 for £5.4 billion to Toshiba. British Energy was sold in 2009 for £12.5 billion to EDF; Centrica (British Gas) had also wanted to buy it; 26 Magnox reactors were built in the UK, followed by 14 AGR reactors.\n\nOperation Hurricane on 3 October 1952, Britain's first nuclear bomb, detonated on HMS Plym on the Montebello Islands in the state of Western Australia, was made of plutonium-239 mostly made at Windscale (which began production in 1950), with some possibly from Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada (where the Tube Alloys project was later moved).\n\nW. T. Glover & Co. of Salford were important electricity cable manufacturers throughout the early 20th century. BAE Systems Wind Tunnel Department at Warton—one of its four wind tunnels—the High Speed Wind Tunnel—can test speeds intermittently up to Mach 3.8 (trisonic)—the second fastest in the UK, to the University of Manchester's Aero-Physics Laboratory which has a hypersonic wind tunnel up to Mach 6. Osborne Reynolds of Owens College (which became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904), known worldwide for his Reynolds number (introduced elsewhere by the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes), showed in the early 1880s that wind tunnels (invented by Francis Herbert Wenham in 1871) could model large-scale objects accurately. BAE Systems Regional Aircraft assembled Britain's last airliner, the British Aerospace 146 (Avro RJX), at Woodford in November 2001. The Merlin-powered Avro Tudor G-AGPF, which took off from what is now Manchester Airport on 14 June 1945, was Britain's first pressurised civilian aircraft; only 38 were built and it was designed for the North Atlantic route. On 13 May 1949, VN799 the English Electric Canberra first flew from Warton: Warton at the time was a former USAAF wartime maintenance base; the German Arado Ar 234 was technically the world's first jet bomber; the Canberra would be the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop crossing of the Atlantic on 21 February 1951.\n\nRobert Whitehead of Bolton invented the modern-day torpedo in 1866. Sir William Pickles Hartley of Lancashire founded Hartley's Jam in 1871, building a purpose-built village at Aintree. Sir Henry Tate also came from Lancashire, joining Abram Lyle in 1921, of whose Golden syrup tins are claimed to be Britain's oldest brand; he established the Tate Gallery in 1897. Robert Hope-Jones of the Wirral invented the Wurlitzer organ. The Christys' & Co factory in Stockport was the largest hat-making factory in the world in the nineteenth century; it became part of Associated British Hat Manufacturers and is now in Oxfordshire. The company owner's son founded Christy in 1850 in Droylsden (now in Tameside), which invented the industrially produced towel.\n\nBritain's most popular car, the Ford Escort, was made throughout its life (until 21 July 2000) at Halewood by Ford; 5 million were made there from 1967. In 1998, production of its replacement the Focus was transferred to Saarlouis and Valencia, which signalled the end of the site's ownership by Ford. The Jaguar X-Type was first made there in May 2001, until late 2009. In the UK, the Mondeo has sold 1.4m since 1993, and is made in Valencia in Spain.\n\nStarchaser Industries of Hyde is hoping to send a British citizen into space, on a British rocket; BAC at Preston had proposed its MUSTARD re-usable spacecraft in 1964, which although not built had given NASA a concept.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Suffragette movement came from Manchester—the Women's Social and Political Union. Arthur Wynne, born in Liverpool, invented the crossword in December 1913. On 13 August 1964, Britain carried out its last two executions at Strangeways and Walton Prison. Under the Museums Act 1845, the UK's second and third public municipal libraries were at Warrington in 1848 and at Salford Museum and Art Gallery in 1850; Canterbury had been first in 1847. The first Trades Union Congress was held in 1868 at the Mechanics' Institute, Manchester. The World Pie Eating Championship is held in Wigan each year.\n\nAnn Lee from Manchester started the USA Shakers movement, founded out of the Quakers, which itself has strong links to Pendle Hill in Lancashire. Joseph Livesey of Preston was the founder of Britain's temperance movement, and the word teetotal was first coined in Preston in 1833. The crumbly Cheshire cheese is thought to be the oldest in Britain. Heaton Park in north Manchester is the largest municipal park in Europe. Jelly Babies were invented in Lancaster in 1864, at Fryers of Lancashire. The first KFC outlet in the UK was on Fishergate in Preston in May 1965, opened by the entrepreneur Ray Allen. Oldham claims to be the site of the first fried potatoes in the UK in 1860. The UK's biggest dance music festival takes place on the August Bank Holiday at Creamfields on Daresbury Estate. Ingvar Kamprad's IKEA opened its first UK store in Warrington on 1 October 1987; the UK was the 20th country at the time that IKEA had been established. The International Cheese Awards are held at the end of July in Nantwich.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester, the two largest cities in the North West by population, are known for being the birthplace of beat music (also called \"Merseybeat\") during the 1960s to 1970s, and the development of the Madchester music scene from the 1980s, and 1990s respectively.\n\nA Taste of Honey was an influential 1960s film set in Salford, depicting working class poverty in ways not previously seen at the cinema, known as kitchen sink realism; Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole, a 1930s book also set in Salford, was thought by the BBFC to be too sordid a depiction of poverty to be made into a film; Mike Leigh, from Salford, has produced films on a similar subject.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nTransport policy\n\n[edit]\n\nAs part of the national transport planning system, the North West Regional Assembly was, before its abolition in 2008, required to produce a Regional Transport Strategy (RTS) to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involved region wide transport schemes, such as those carried out by the Highways Agency and Network Rail.[39] Within the region, the local transport authorities plan for the future by producing Local Transport Plans (LTPs) which outline their strategies, policies and implementation programmes.[40] The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the North West region, the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: Blackburn with Darwen U.A,[41] Blackpool U.A.,[42] Cheshire,[43] Cumbria,[44] Greater Manchester,[45] Halton U.A.,[46] Lancashire,[47] Merseyside[48] and Warrington U.A.[49] Since 1 April 2009, when the county of Cheshire was split into two unitary councils[50] the Cheshire transport authority ceased to exist, however it is the most recent LTP for the area.\n\nRoad\n\n[edit]\n\nRegionwide\n\n[edit]\n\nRegionwide, the principal road link is the M6, which enters the region, from Scotland, near Carlisle in the north and leaves it, for the English Midlands, near Crewe in the south. It connects such towns and cities as Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Warrington, Liverpool and Manchester. The M6 intersects many of the North West's motorways and A-roads, carrying almost 120,000 vehicles per day (41,975,000 per year).[51]\n\nBritain's most severe steep road is Hardknott Pass in Cumbria and the highest road in the UK is the former A6293 at 2,780 ft at Milburn, Cumbria; the highest classified road in England was the A689 east of Nenthead in Cumbria on the Durham boundary.\n\nGreater Manchester and Merseyside\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Transport in Liverpool and Transport in Manchester\n\nThe Greater Manchester and Merseyside areas are home to almost 4 million people; over half of the region's population. The road networks intertwining these metropolitan areas are extremely important to the economy and are largely motorway, including the M62 which crosses the entire country (east to west, Hull to Liverpool); this motorway directly connects the cities of Manchester and Liverpool, carrying 78,000 vehicles in the North West per day.[52]\n\nThe Merseyside-Manchester region has many other motorways that serve many millions on a daily basis: the M61 connects Manchester to Preston; the M56 runs south of Manchester to Cheshire and Wales; the M57 and M58 motorways run north of Liverpool and connect towns such as St. Helens and Wigan; the M60 is Manchester's ring road; and the M67 and M66 motorways run east and north respectively, both of these roads are under 10 mi (16 km) and link Manchester to smaller outlying settlements. On top of this there are countless numbers of A-roads, B-roads and minor roads which circle, entwine and serve these two major metropolises.\n\nCumbria\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Cumbria the M6 runs all the way down the east of the county connecting the very north of England to the Lancashire border. The A590 links Barrow-in-Furness to Kendal with around 14,000 vehicles per day.[53] The A595 runs all the way along the West Cumbrian coast beginning near Barrow and ending in Carlisle, linking towns such as Whitehaven and Workington. The A591 road runs from Kendal to the centre of the county connecting Lake District settlements like Windermere, Ambleside and Keswick. Other important A-roads include the A5092, A66, A596 and formerly the A74, until this was upgraded to motorway standard as an extension of the M6 between 2006 and 2008 to meet the A74(M) at the Scottish border.\n\nLancashire\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6, which also runs from north to south (Lancaster to Chorley). Other motorways in the region include the M55, which connects the city of Preston and the town of Blackpool at 11.5 mi (18.5 km) in length. The M65 motorway runs from east to west, starting in the town of Colne, running past Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn and terminating in Preston. The Lancaster-Morecambe area is served by the A683, A6, A588 and A589 roads. The Blackpool-Fylde-Fleetwood area is home to the A583, A584, A585, A586, A587 and A588 roads. The city of Preston and its surroundings are served by the A6, A59, A582, A583, A584 and, to the very south-east, the M61 motorway. To the east of the county are the A59, A6119, A677, A679, A666, A680, A56, A646 and A682. The M66 begins 500 m (0.3 mi) inside the county border near Edenfield, providing an important link between east Lancashire and Manchester.\n\nCheshire\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Cheshire, there are four motorways: the M6, the M56 (linking Chester to the east), the M53 (linking Chester to Birkenhead) and the M62, which runs just along the county's northern border with Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The Cheshire road system is made up of 3,417 mi (5,499 km) of highway and the principal road (M6) carries 140,000[54] vehicles in the county daily, linking the North West to the West Midlands.\n\nThe county town of Chester is served by the A55, A483 and A494 roads, amongst others. To the west of the M6, Crewe, Northwich and Sandbach are served by the A54, A51, A49, A533, A556 and A530 roads; these all eventually link up connecting the towns to the larger cities, including Stoke-on-Trent to the south.
