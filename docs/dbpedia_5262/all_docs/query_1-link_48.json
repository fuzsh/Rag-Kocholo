        "text": "Jung brings to Pentair its strong application engineering expertise, and a complementary product offering, including a new line of water re-use products, submersible wastewater and drainage pumps, wastewater disposal units and tanks. Jung also brings to Pentair its well-known European presence, a state-of-the-art training facility in Germany, and sales offices in Austria, France, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.\n\n\"Pentair Water expands its reach into the European wastewater market with the addition of Jung,\" said Richard Cathcart, Pentair vice chairman. \"We view the wastewater market as an attractive growth opportunity - especially in Eastern Europe, where environmental considerations, new regulations and improving infrastructure are accelerating the connection rates of homes to municipal infrastructure.\"\n\nCathcart said that with Jung's strong distribution, sales and service network, Pentair will be positioned to more effectively serve the European market with both the Jung line and the Company's HydromaticÂ® offering. Hydromatic is an industry-leading, diversified line of submersible sump, sewage, effluent, and grinder pumps, large non-clog pumps and self primers.\n\nThe transaction is subject to receipt of approval from the German Federal Cartel Office and is expected to be completed in early 2007."
