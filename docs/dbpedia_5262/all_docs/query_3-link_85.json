        "text": "I have been doing a lot of research on UV sterilizers for my upcoming 350 gallon build. With all the misinformation and lack of information in some cases, I decided to call Pentair UV and get some questions answered. Interestingly, he himself is a long tome reefer and actually has a coral propagation business in Panama and sells all his coral and fish to a wholesaler.\n\nI will Summarize my conversation below:\n\n1- Pentair has spent millions of dollars on independent studies to determine the correct flow and exposure rates on their units. They are a huge company providing all kinds of equipment to treat all kinds of water conditions in many types of water treatment plants. They have have federal approval and licenses that provide scientific proof their units work as advertised.\n\n2- Most UV manufacturers ( according to him) don’t have adequate exposure and flow rates for their UV’s. An example is comparing the Pentair 50 watt unit to the Aqua Ultraviolet 57 watt. The Aqua unit states a minimum flow for Protozoa and bacteria at 1066 GPH and a maximum flow of 3200 GPH for a 355 gallon aquarium. The Pentair 50 watt unit recommends Protozoa and bacteria to have a flow between 260 to 330 GHP for a 330 gallon aquarium. That’s a big difference, with Pentair recommending a flow rate of about 3 times less.\n\n3- The pentair technical advisor indicated that turning over the water in the tank 1 time per hour is a minimum. Many Protozoa and bacteria may not get denatured or killed with only 1 pass through the UV and will most likely need another pass. Therefore, having a UV sterilizer large enough to move the water in your tank 2-3 times is ideal.\n\n4- He also recommended keeping your tank temperature lower than most people keep their reefs. According to him, Corals live in much colder water than 78 degrees and Protozoa multiply much slower at lower temperatures such as 72-74 degrees.\n\nSo for a reef with a volume of water of 300 gallons, he recommended using the 120 watt UV and passing the water through the UV at 600 GPH and turning the water over a minimum of 2 times per hour. If you go with the 150 watt you will get a little over 3 times water tank turnover. Yes, these units are big and are not suitable for many due to space restraints but for those who have the room, it’s something to think about.\n\nThe above information is not stated as fact but for information purposes only. I am sure there are some on this forum who are very informed on UV sterilization and welcome your opinion.\n\nI have been doing a lot of research on UV sterilizers for my upcoming 350 gallon build.

I didn’t even think about lowering my temps and slowing down my UV when I had an ich breakout.\n\nNo wonder I failed at ich management!\n\nThank you for sharing this! While I do agree that cooler temps slow algae, parasites, and bacteria, I will probably need a chiller for that.\n\nA very interesting read. The only thing I can personally add (Pentair 40W on each of my 150-gallon tanks) is that they like to ‘pop’ various types of circuit breakers, somewhat at random. I read the best strategy is to isolate them so only one UV unit is plugged into a single outlet without any other device. Even with that, I might get 1 hour, 1/2 a day, maybe a day and a half, and when I swing by to take at look the circuit breaker I’m using it has been tripped. It happens with both units, where I will reset them both and one might be off five hours later and the other is still doing fine. Go figure. (?) (And yes, both my units passed the required ‘paper towel’ test.)\n\nA very interesting read.

(And yes, both my units passed the required ‘paper towel’ test.)\n\nI would reach out to them, I have a 40w that would trip the breaker and they sent me a new power supply/ballast whatever it is called I can't remember. They had redesigned it so the new one they sent is totally different.\n\nBut that fixed my issue and it hasn't happened again since.\n\nThey were very helpful.\n\nGot any studies to back that claim?\n\nEvery study of the subject across competing manufactures that I'm aware of, disagrees with you.\n\nFlow rate is paramount to efficacy.\n\nFirst of all, manufacturers haven't conducted any real studies. They have guidelines they came up with. The only actual study on UV dose and Cryptocaryon was published in late 2021:\n\nUltraviolet light and ozone controls Cryptocaryon irritans infection in factory aquaculture | Semantic Scholar\n\nSemantic Scholar extracted view of \"Ultraviolet light and ozone controls Cryptocaryon irritans infection in factory aquaculture\" by Geling Lu et al.\n\nNext, the idea that UV dosage is cumulative has already been discussed (it is):\n\nAre the effects of UV sterilizer cumulative?\n\nContact time being the primary factor in whether or not a cell dies/is damaged I was wondering. Since our tanks are closed systems does each pass into the UV accumulate ontop of the last? If something takes x amount of a dose to die but each pass hits it with 1/10th of x and it passes the...\n\nThe hobby has this strange idea that anything that isn't completely killed in a single pass repairs itself instantly and without any energy input or consumption of cellular resources (which is strange since the theronts aren't a feeding stage and have a finite supply of energy). This notion was dispelled in the aforementioned study:\n\nAll the single pass studies from drinking water (which don't even actually involve Cryptocaryon) are largely irrelevant. What are more relevant are the studies where the media is recirculating through a UV reactor (\"sterilizer\") at different flow rates. The slow flow rates always perform the worst while the faster ones are better and perform similarly to one another.\n\nA very interesting read.

Even with that, I might get 1 hour, 1/2 a day, maybe a day and a half, and when I swing by to take at look the circuit breaker I’m using it has been tripped. It happens with both units, where I will reset them both and one might be off five hours later and the other is still doing fine. Go figure. (?) (And yes, both my units passed the required ‘paper towel’ test.)\n\nPaper towel test? That is so strange what else is on that I assume 15 Amp circuit? Are they GFI ?"
