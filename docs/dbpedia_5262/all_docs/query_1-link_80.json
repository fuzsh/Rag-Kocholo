        "text": "Discover our wide range of products for single-point (tap) applications, appliances and budgets. Aquatiere™ has water filter options for almost every problem. With the correct water filter, you can solve many issues. From the riddance of terribly bad-tasting water to targeted contaminant removal, using an Aquatiere™ to purify your water will ensure the water is safe and healthy for the whole family.\n\nOur range of outdoor water filters use both Ceramet granular ceramics and Ecosorb to produce water that is good for the environment. Our garden hose filters produce chlorine free, pH balanced water that is great for watering the garden, and if used to top up fish ponds, is beneficial to the fish.\n\nAccustomed to using a garden hose water filter for washing your car? Why not try our car cleaning filters instead, which use Ecosorb, a resin that reduces spotting in the washing and rinsing process.\n\nAt Aquatiere, we offer the modern day equivalent to a traditional water softener. While many households and businesses suffer from scale build up they also have to deal with often substandard water quality. Traditional salt-based water softeners only treat the hardness minerals in your water supply, they do not filter out contaminants. In fact the resin in a traditional water softener is adversely effected by chlorine which is in our water supply. Our Pureau systems offer the best of both worlds – great filtered water throughout the home of business with guaranteed 99% protection of scale build up in pipework and equipment. Pureau systems can be used in food and beverage production as they do not add sodium to the water. No sodium not only allows the units to protect against scale but also opens up new potential solutions in domestic and commercial premises. We offer specification and remote on-site advice by video calling. Simply book an appointment by email or phone.\n\nWater Filter Spares, Tools & Accessories – our selection of tools, spares and accessories for commercial or whole-house water filtration systems. Whether your planning to install or service your water filter, we have a good range of products to suit your needs.\n\nIf you are unsure as to which item you need, please feel free to contact us.\n\nDiscover our wide range of products for single-point (tap) applications, appliances and budgets.
