        "text": "Water treatment company Pentair has teamed up with US-based Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) on a plastic-reduction initiative.\n\nThe partners will provide drinking water while reducing the need for single-use plastic water bottles for travellers in the MSP international hub.\n\nPentair will also become the Official Water Sponsor of MSP Airport, making it the first partner in MSP’s new strategic partnership programme.\n\nThe collaboration will see the installation of ten HOPE Hydration HydroStations, which are claimed to be the first of their kind at any airport globally.\n\nThese advanced water refill stations will provide millions of travellers with free, chilled, and filtered water, encouraging the use of reusable water bottles.\n\nThe HydroStations are equipped with Everpure filtration technology from Pentair Water Solutions, providing a sustainable alternative to single-use plastics for both MSP employees and travellers.\n\nPentair Water Solutions EVP and president Adrian Chiu said: “Pentair aims to create a better world for people and the planet through smart, sustainable water solutions.\n\n“Our Everpure filtration technology is a leader in the foodservice industry, and we are excited to bring our filtration expertise to MSP in support of their efforts to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable practices by providing travellers with free, filtered water at the HydroStations.”\n\nThe HydroStations also serve an educational purpose, informing travellers about water-related issues and the environmental benefits of using reusable bottles.\n\nIt is estimated that the existing network of 80 water bottle refill stations at MSP already plays a significant role in reducing plastic waste, with an estimated 600lbs of single-use plastic bottles saved daily.\n\nIncorporating integrated Internet-of-Things technology, the HydroStations will monitor and display real-time impact data, including plastic and carbon emissions savings.\n\nMetropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) CEO Brian Ryks said: “Our goal is to make it easy for passengers and our airport community to choose reusable options over single-use options.\n\n“We’re excited about this strategic partnership because it shines a brighter spotlight on ways to reduce waste and support sustainable practices that go well beyond the airport.”\n\nMSP, operated by the MAC, ranks as the 19th busiest airport in North America in terms of passenger traffic."
