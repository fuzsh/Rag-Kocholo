        "text": "Ann saw me wasting my time, er, excuse me, reading this book and she asked, “Are those books actually any good?!” And I had a revelation – yes, usually, they are really entertaining. But this one, Book Two in the Five (and continuing) Vanguard series actually kinda isn’t.\n\nI loved, loved, loved the worldbuilding in David Mack’s first Vanguard novel Harbinger, but the follow-up, authored by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dillmore, is desultory and dull. It lacks a singular narrative drive, a throughline, and has a never ending cast of expanding characters just drifting all over the place. It is, in short, a mess.\n\nStill, it is a fun place to be, this space station in the nefarious Taurus Reach, and I’m not about to throw in the towel (especially as Mack is back for Book 3 – which I just ordered from Amazon.)\n\nWhat it comes down to is this: I’ve been lucky with the Trek fiction I’ve read. I’ve read decent authors dealing with aspects of the expanded universe that I have an unquenchable interest in. But I recognize there’s a lot of dreck out there . . .and I’m hoping I don’t run into more."
