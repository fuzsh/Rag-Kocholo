        "text": "Good Morning, Everyone!\n\nI hope everyone survived Thanksgiving and Black Friday. I had a turkey dinner with my parents and an uncle on Thanksgiving - and that was it. I did go to Walmart on Black Friday but didn't buy anything.\n\nI know this is a broken record with me, but I'm going to try to get caught up on reviews this week. I have a pile of books and movies that I need to be review. If only I could stay off of Netflix and Hulu, maybe I could get some writing done.\n\nA Missing Book\n\nBefore Thanksgiving, I rearranged two bookcases because I wanted to put my John Saul books in chronological order by publication date. That's when I noticed one book was missing- Black Creek Crossing. I know I had read the book at least once. (Most likely, I had checked it out at the library.) I \"googled\" the Black Creek Crossing and didn't recognize the cover at all. I went straight to eBay and purchased the paperback from a used bookseller, who had a buy two get one free sale.\n\nWhile I was known as the weird kid who liked Star Trek during my childhood, the Trek novels never appealed to me. If my memory serves me correctly, I only read six or seven Trek titles during my childhood. One of these books was Deep Domain by Howard Weinstein. I bought it at a garage sale when I was nine or ten years old. At the time, I thought it was a sequel to the film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home because of the giant fins in the center of the cover. However, the two aren't connected at all. Instead, Deep Domain takes place in the water world of Akkalla. Anyway, I liked the novel quite a bit, and somewhere down the line, the book went missing. I have no clue what happened to it. As you probably already saw in the above photo, Deep Domain is one of the three books. To be more precise, it is the \"free\" book.\n\nThe other Star Trek novel is titled Probe. I have heard lots of things about the book, but have never read it. Probe a direct sequel to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, where the USS Enterprise and her crew are investigating the origins of the whale probe. Now there's quite a bit of history about this book. Author Margaret Wander Bonanno pitched the idea for the sequel. Depending on who you talk to, some say the pitch was for the fifth Star Trek film. If that's true, we all know that didn't pan out well. Bonanno's idea became the novel Music of the Spheres, later retitled Probe. Unfortunately, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's office disliked her first draft. Then Pocket Books hired Gene DeWeese to do a rewrite. DeWeese never got credited for writing Probe because Pocket Books had already designed the cover with Bonanno as the author. Instead, the publishers mentioned DeWeese as a contributor. Bonanno disowned the Probe and made her version, Music of the Spheres, available to download on her website for free. Sadly, Bonanno passed away earlier this year, and her website is no more. Note - If you \"google\" for Music of the Spheres, you can easily find a pdf download.\n\nWhat Am I Reading?\n\nI'll finish reading The Debutante's Code by Erica Vetsch sometime in the early morning hours. Then I'll start writing my review, which needs to be posted today for a book blog tour. Next, I will read The Christmas Promise by Richard Paul Evans.\n\nUpdate - I should write things down on a calendar. My review tour date is for The Debutante's Code is December 7th, not the 5th.\n\nRecent Reviews\n\nWhat's in the Mail?\n\nDune: The Duke of Caladan by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson arrived in the mailbox last week from Hamilton Books. I was ordering a Christmas gift for a family member, and I went ahead and bought the Dune book for $7.95. It's the first book in The Caladan Trilogy.\n\nLast Saturday, I received The Debutante's Code by Erica Vetsch, which I already mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nWhat's New On the Bookshelf?\n\nI picked up the two newest James Patterson books - Fear No Evil and City of the Dead. Fear No Evil is the newest Alex Cross story. City of the Dead is the eleventh Maximum Ride installment.\n\nOne of these days, I want to read the entire Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. I started reading the first novel shortly after the first half of the 1st season of the Starz series aired. I read nearly half of it before getting sidetracked by ARCs. My bookmark is still inside the paperback, marking where I left off. I bought the ninth book, Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone, as soon as it came out last month.\n\nThere are lots of new tiles on my Kindle, starting with the month 99 cent Star Trek titles - I, Q by Peter David and John de Lancie, Star Trek: Vanguard: Summon the Thunder by Dayton Ward & Kevin Dilmore, Vanguard: Reap the Whirlwind by David Mack, Vanguard: Open Secrets by Dayton Ward, Vanguard: Precipice by David Mack, Vanguard: Declassified by Marco Palmieri, Dayton Ward, David Mack, and Kevin Dilmore, Vanguard: What Judgments Come by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore, Vanguard: Storming Heaven by David Mack, and Vanguard: In Tempest's Wake by Dayton Ward. On Black Friday, I grabbed Forever You: A Memoir by Hayle Mills for $4.99. Also, I got Blood Sugar by Daniel Kraus for $1.99, a Hard Case Crime novel I've had my eyes on for quite some time."
