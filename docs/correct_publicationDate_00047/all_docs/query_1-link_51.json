Tagged: Author.\n\n(1967- ) US soldier, software developer and author whose career in the latter capacity succeed his eleven years active service in the Marine Corps, most of his stories and books located in various regions of the Star Trek universe, beginning with his first story, \"Reflections\" in Strange New Worlds (anth 1998) edited by Paula M Block, John J Ordover and Dean Wesley Smith. Almost all of his subsequent career has been spent supplying Ties to various Star Trek series, beginning with In the Name of Honor (2002); his background may explain an emphasis on the Military SF side of the enterprise. Of interest beyond this work is the Last World War sequence beginning with The Last World War (2003), in which Earth suffers Invasion via Stargates in an interstellar War involving two Alien civilizations.
