        "text": "Introduction\n\nPerhaps a good way to capture Roberto Rossellini’s (b. 1906–d. 1977) protean creativity and deep and ongoing influence is to describe him as one of the truly great makers and unmakers of modern cinema. His career can be divided into four stages, and in all but the first his impact was considerable in helping establish markedly new models of filmmaking, not only in terms of what films should look like and focus on but how they could be made and what purposes they should serve. The first stage was his work as a writer, production assistant, and then director during the last years of the Fascist period in Italy, making films like The Man of the Cross (1943) that were conventional in many respects and had elements of nationalism and propaganda but were also seedbeds for the much different kind of films that he turned to when the Fascists fell from power and the war came to an end. Rome Open City (1945) and Paisan (1946) are highlights of his second stage and landmarks in the rebirth of Italian and subsequently worldwide cinema under the banner of “neorealism,” intended as an antidote to Hollywood production methods and style and a commercial cinema of distraction by making film a vehicle for serious social analysis and progressive political action. But for all that Rossellini is associated with neorealism, an approach to filmmaking in fact with often-unrecognized diversity and even contradictory elements, he very quickly moved to films in the third stage of his career that to some were a betrayal and to others yet another marvelous reinvention of cinema. The films he made featuring Ingrid Bergman in the late 1940s and early 1950s, especially Stromboli (1949) and Voyage in Italy (1953), focused on crises of faith, problems of intimacy and personal relationships, and the devastating effects on individuals of the institutions and conventions surrounding us that entrap rather than protect and nurture. But though these works were enormously influential on the following generations of filmmakers—especially the French New Wave auteurs, but also directors in Italy forging a post-neorealist cinema engaging with problems beyond poverty and war—they were commercially unsuccessful, and in the last stage of his career Rossellini had to find new institutional support for his projects. He found this in television, and during the remaining years of his life he created an impressive and extensive body of films on pivotal figures (e.g., The Rise to Power of Louis XIV [1966]) and eras (e.g., The Age of the Medici [1972]) that developed new ways to express his abiding interest in the representation and critical examination of human history. These films properly capped a life’s work characterized by artistic ingenuity, resourcefulness, and innovation, and devoted to turning modern visual media into instruments of much-needed historical and moral interrogation and education, spiritual renewal, and humanistic progress."
