        "text": "Sicily is a fascinating land, at the center of the Mediterranean Sea, which is why it’s very variegated, both for its nature and its culture. Cinema couldn’t resist that appeal and portrayed the island in different ways and different periods of history.\n\nIn this article, you will learn about the most beautiful movies set in Sicily, very famous ones, who influenced the mass culture and put the beauty of this island under the spotlight.\n\nCinema Paradiso\n\nCinema Paradiso is a 1988 film by Giuseppe Tornatore, who won an Academy Award for this. At the center of the film, we find the character of Salvatore, a successful director who lives in Rome and hadn’t been to his hometown in Sicily for a long time. But he later finds out about the death of Alfredo, the old projectionist of Cinema Paradiso, the little cinema of his hometown.\n\nAlfredo was very important to Salvatore, as he made him discover the art of cinema. So, he decides to go back to his town in Sicily, but everything has changed: Cinema Paradiso doesn’t exist anymore, and his old love is now married with children. Salvatore goes back to Rome with many regrets and a film that was left to him by Alfredo: that film includes all the censored scenes that Salvatore wanted to watch when he was a child. To him, that film becomes a symbol of the immortality of cinema and a memory of his old friend.\n\nPaisà\n\nPaisan is a masterpiece of Italian Neorealism, it is a 1946 collective movie directed by Roberto Rossellini.

Carmela, a girl, offers to accompany them over the minefield and they arrive at a castle. While the other soldiers check the area, Carmela and Joe, a soldier, are found by Germans, who kill the man. So, Carmela tries to shoot them, but she is killed and her body is thrown from the balcony. When the American soldiers come back, they only find Joe’s body and they think the girl killed him.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nThe Godfather is a big international success, a 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the homonymous novel by Mario Puzo.
