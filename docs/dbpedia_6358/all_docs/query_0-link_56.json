        "text": "I was excited to watch Cinema Paradiso after watching the Intro to Cinema Paradiso in the Panopto recordings. Sergio briefly touched on this film’s history and why it became so known and favored by non-Italians. Personally, I enjoy watching films about nostalgia. When Sergio mentioned how Cinema Paradiso was a film about nostalgia and told from the perspective of an old film maker in Rome I was more intrigued. Patrick Ramble explained why Americans love this film so much; that being, this film taps into the feeling of community which is something that Americans are often taught to suppress.\n\nAfter watching Cinema Paradiso, I completely understood Rambles’ perspective. Of the few films we have watched in this class so far, Cinema Paradiso is my favorite. Not only is the film about nostalgia, it is about an entire film watching experience through a sense of community. Cinema Paradiso is about friendships, relationships, family, community, socialization, and life as an Italian. This film touched on almost all emotions and I was able to feel some of those emotions. Towards the end of the movie when Toto went back for the funeral I felt the emotion as he visited the cinema site. After watching the first 90% of the film I was able to empathize with Toto as he traveled back to the old cinema site and reminisced; more so, as Toto began spotting familiar faces I was able to feel all the old memories that he felt.\n\nThe film incorporated many different lightening (mise-en-scene) techniques and creatively used different types of shots. In the beginning of the film, it was a dark stormy night when Toto received news that Alfredo had passed. The lighting was dark and casted a few shadows, the background noise was a storm/rain, and Totos expression was sad. Fast forward during the film, when Toto was first acquainted with Alfredo the shots were often shot/reverse shots. The camera would shoot Toto and then reverse to Alfredo as these two were conversing. The director also did a good job at incorporating different frame angles. For example, as Toto and Alfredo were conversing during the initial acquainting period, the camera used a low-angle shot when shooting Alfredo from Totos perspective. Vice versa, the camera used a high-angle shot when shooting Toto from Alfredo’s perspective.\n\nTransitioning to how the Catholic church contributed to cinema, I found it entertaining seeing how the Priest showed disgust for romantic scenes. The Catholic church was a huge reason for cinema back in the 1940s-1970s in Italy, the church facilitated film watching and was also able to use it for moral control.\n\nWagstaff Italian Cinema is about the evolution of films and all components that contributed to it such as technology, institutions, and the artistic/aesthetics of creating films. The 1930s was when sound was introduced to Italian films and by the 1960s the Italian film market was booming. This reading illustrated the impact that the fascist government had on Italian films and examined how the Catholic church contributed to the success of Italian films.\n\nBefore cinema became popular, films were merely judged based on the title and director. Eventually, it was decided that people did not purchase movie tickets because of the title of director, people purchased tickets to engage in a psychological experience. As Wagstaff says, “What the audience purchases with its ticket-money is not usually an artistic experience, but a psychological service; it is paying to be made to laugh, to be moved to tears, to feel the tension and release of suspense, to indulge in romantic and erotic fantasies, to witness the playing out of unresolvable conflicts in social life, to experience for two hours the plush luxury of the movie palace, to be momentarily freed from the trials of daily life, and many other things.” I feel as if this is one hundred percent relatable and holds true today. When people decide on a movie it is usually based on how they want the movie to make them feel. For example, Netflix categorizes movies by genre not by director.\n\nBetween the 1930s-1970s film had evolved immensely, sound was introduced, many new shots and techniques started to be used which helped in conveying a sense of realism in the films. Cinema Paradiso is a prime example of this which I mentioned earlier in this blog. After WWII ended films had to be made inexpensively due to the financial impact the war had on Italy. The result was the use of non professional actors and outside location shooting. These types of films were the introduction to “neorealist” films. I enjoyed reading this archive during the first week of school because it gave way into what I am now learning, neorealism.\n\nRome Open City was another great film I watched during week 3. Other than Cinema Paradiso, Rome Open City was a close first for my overall favorite films I have watched so far. Rome Open City did a great job at illustrating the beginning of WWII; more so, I felt like even though it was a war focused film, I was still able to relate to the characters. In the beginning of the film I found it difficult to stay focused but as soon as Pina was killed I felt like it symbolized a sort of defiance against injustice; furthermore, there was nothing in the film that prepared me for that moment so it was even more memorable and significant. I felt as if that scene layed down the foundation for the rest of the film. I found it interesting that Pina portrayed Teresa Gullace back in WWII. The film did a great job at incorporating actual events and real people such as Pina. The film conveyed how supportive and loyal the partisans were towards each other. Manfredi and Don Pietro demonstrated the extent to which they were willing to sacrifice their lives if it meant not giving Gestapo what he wanted. The ending of the movie struck a chord with me because it illustrated how brutal the times were back then and that executing someone was not a big deal to the Fascists. I found it interesting that the camera showed the expressions of the children after Don Pietro’s killing, it signified a moment of the children realizing that something was wrong with what had been done to Don Pietro. A camera movement that was incorporated in Rome Open City was panning which was used in the opening and closing of the film to establish location. Lastly, I’d like to mention how I found it odd that even though Rome Open City was made to make known the lives of Italians during WWII and the underground resistance, the film was advertised to Americans in a provocative way. I felt as if this fact led into the later accounts I will touch on such as Schoonover.\n\nShiel did a good job giving readers an understanding as to how Rome Open City was the beginning of neorealism. Shiel believed that we had to first understand the Italian city, urbanization, and its representation in order to understand neorealism. Throughout all the neorealist films I have watched so far I find Shiels account accurate. The visual style we see in Rome Open City is the use of non professional actors, location shooting rather than studio shooting, and a preference for natural light (mise-en-scene). I felt that Rome Open City did a great job given the extreme financial situation they were in at the time and the fact that in 1944-1945 most of the filming equipment was removed by Germans and the Italian Fascists. Neorealism was the driving force in making known the lives of ordinary Italians at the end of WWII, Rome Open City captured the ambition of the underground resistance against Fascists and Nazis according to Shiel. I thoroughly enjoyed Shiels reading because after watching Rome Open City I was able to make real connections through Shiels voice and the film. I would not have guessed that the actors were non-professional and that the production was on a strict budget; however, after reading Shiels account I was more appreciative of the film and all the work put into it.\n\nBazin introduced us to viewing Paisan as one of the Italian films that fit into the realist spectrum. The style of the film Paisan is a dynamic principle in the narrative by helping the audience understand and feel what they are watching. Paisan is the first film I have watched in this course that is a series of six short stories all interrelated by their shared history to the Italian Liberation. In this film I noticed that the use of natural light and location shooting resembles neorealist films to a tee. In the fifth episode where the monks find out that two out of the three men are not Catholic, I felt like it demonstrated how strong the Catholic religion is and how seriously they adhere to it. It was neat seeing that everyone was still able to get along despite their differences in beliefs. In the fifth episode, the Americans hand out chocolate bars to the monks more than one time. I wonder if there was significance in the chocolate bars meaning that it was common for soldiers to keep chocolate bars on them during the war.\n\nEven though I felt that Schoonovers reading was difficult I was able to pull out his main theme being that neorealism lies between sensational rawness and world understanding. Schoonover examines several different accounts of neorealism; however, he continued to argue promotional advertisements that make neorealist films into something more or less sexual/intimate hinders the spectator from seeing the specific post-war mode aspect. I enjoyed Schoonovers main argument, especially towards the end where he says conveys to his readers that neorealist films can be a foundation for training and moving American spectators from affectionate involvement to concerned detachment."
