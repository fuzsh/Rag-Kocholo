        "text": "This article analyses the connection between Italian and Colombian cinema through the novels and films of Colombian author and filmmaker Fernando Vallejo (1942–present). It examines Vallejo’s autofictional novel, Los caminos a Roma (The Roads to Rome) (1988) where he recounts his experience as a student at Rome’s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in 1966, criticizes Italian neorealism and auteurism, and articulates his embryonic idea to create a film set during Colombia’s civil war. In his critique of Italian cinema, I argue that Vallejo embodies a certain hostility towards European film, its institutions and especially Italian neorealism that was percolating in the Latin America of the 1960s and 1970s. Exploring the historiography of Italy’s relationship with Latin American cinema, I remark on an emergent (and problematic) privileging of Italian neorealism as a prototype for New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) and consider how Vallejo’s filmmaking was shaped in opposition to Italian archetypes.\n\nThis interview showcases the experience that Colombian film director and editor Felipe Guerrero had at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia (CSC) in Rome, where he specialized in film editing from 1996 to 1999. Guerrero is widely known for his several film and television productions from all over the world, as well as for his five credits as a film director who has been fundamental to the revitalization of contemporary Colombian and Latin American cinema (from 1999 to the present; he is currently writing his second feature-length fiction film, entitled 1948). In this interview, Felipe Guerrero speaks about the meaningful experience he had at CSC for his career as a filmmaker and underlines how honoured he was to be among the few filmmakers accepted at the CSC during the 1990s. In sum, this interview is a rare and unique insight into the memories from one of the most important contemporary Latin American filmmakers had at CSC.\n\nThis issue of the ‘Archival Notes’ column describes two richly intertwined archival collections, one personal and one institutional. Both are held at the Museo Nazionale del Cinema in Turin (MNC, Italy) and house documents pertaining to the activities of MNC’s founder and film historian Maria Adriana Prolo (1908–91). The column provides a brief personal profile, details her personal and professional challenges – which led her to compare notes with Henri Langlois of the Cinémathèque française – and sheds light on the plans, accomplishments and never-realized projects of Italy’s first (and for decades only) woman film museum director."
