        "text": "Roberta Rossellini, the young Italian who first swam into our ken as the director of that fine Italian picture, \"La Citta Aperta\" (\"Open City\"), has now come forth with a film which, in many aspects, marks a milestone in the expressiveness of the screen. \"Paisan\" is the title and it opened at the World yesterday.It is useless to attempt an explanation, in familiar and concrete terms, of its basic theme and nature, for it is not an ordinary film—neither in form nor dramatic construction nor in the things it has to say. In some ways, it is the antithesis of the classic \"story film,\" and certainly it throws off glints of meaning which are strangely unfamiliar on the screen. Possibly for some persons who are accustomed to the routine sort of film, it will be completely bewildering and leave a sad sense of emptiness. But at least it cannot fail to rattle the windowpanes of your eyes. And for many it will crash into the consciousness and leave the emotions limp.For, in a series of six dramatic incidents which supposedly occurred during the Allied war campaign in Italy—random incidents, with no connection, except by war—Mr. Rossellini constructs a terrifying picture of the disillusion, the irony, the horribleness of strife. More than that, he bluntly shows the tragic chasms which open between good people under circumstances of war and, without saying so, he makes evident the gant, sad thing that life is in a world of hate and killing.The first incident involves an American patrol in Sicily. One soldier is shot; an Italian girl is blamed and killed—yet, a few minutes before, she has been listening, sensing and sympathizing without comprehending, while the soldier talked to her of his family back home. That is all.The second incident is equally cryptic. An American Negro MP in Naples gets drunk, sings his sadness to a little street urchin, has his shoes stolen by the boy and tries to get them back next day, only to discover the horrible squalor in which the little fellow lives.And so on through the picture. There is an episode involving a Roman street-walker and a heart-sick \"Joe\"; one referring to the Partisans in Florence and an American nurse who hopes to meet an old lover there. Then there is a curious little incident in a Franciscan monastery in the Apennines and a final, cynical decimation of Italian partisans and American O.S.S. men in the marshy, bleak delta of the River Po.As we say, there is no dramatic pattern in which all of these incidents are tied, yet the cumulative impact of them achieves an oddly disturbing effect. And the remarkable thing is that each incident is played for understatement straight through, with classic climaxes avoided and the anti-climax almost obviously applied. The consequence is a curious climate which accumulates as the film goes on—a climate such as that in the eye of a hurricane, windless and airless, in which all tragedy suddenly seems futile and flat This is the ultimate expression which Mr. Rossellini has accomplished in his film.The manner of its accomplishment is in his memorable \"documentary\" style, with this curious truncation of episodes. Through actuality photography, with an almost completely \"pick-up\" cast, including many Americans, he has developed a tremendous naturalness. And a musical theme of great pathos, running through the episodes, clinches the effect.In Italian, \"paisan\" has the meaning of the common term \"bud\" in our tongue. Even the title is ironic. This is a film to be seen—and seen again.\n\nPAISAN; scenario by Sergio Amidei, Klaus Mann, Alfred Hayes, Marcello Pagliero, Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini; directed and produced by Roberto Rossellini, and released here by Mayer-Burstyn, Inc.
