        "text": "Paisan and Rome Open City\n\nThroughout weeks three and four we dove deep into the style and historical context behind the Italian film industry, exploring in particular the neorealistic film style which can probably be best described as an authentic approach at capturing the everyday lives and realities the Italian people faced during and after the second world war. it important to make mention to the fact that the neorealistic film style was unique fro its time and had never really been done before. before the war began, the Italian film industry was a powerhouse- making some of the most revolutionary and exciting films at the time. they experimented with many new cinematography techniques such as low and high key lighting, mounting filming equipment on sleds to create an active shot. However, Post world war 2 all infrastructure was devastated by mass bombings so in an attempt to create a sense of nationalism the neorealism film style was created. At the foundation of this film style is a rather “do it yourself” approach, meaning non professional actors were used and the topics that were filmed about were about everyday life and typically about the post war depression.\n\nIn the beginning there was great push back from the Italian community, but when the films started to gather popularity and generate jobs and wealth it was soon adapted with open arms. The phrase “Cinecittà” was adapted which means film city, which symbolically restored Italy back to the film capital of the world. Which raises the question…by creating films that focused on the devastation and hardships the Italian nation faced, does it allow this terrible time in history to be remembered? and what effect does this possibly have on future generations knowing this part of their history?\n\nthroughout week three we watched “Rome, Open City” which dove deeper into the neorealistic film style which cover themes that typically revolved around the war time period. The film was based upon Rome when it was occupied by the Nazi regieme and the underground society that was working towards over ruling the German army and taking back the city. the film had moments of great suspense and ominous loom of danger but couldn’t help but create a sense f optimism and hope for the Italian people. again at the heart of this film is creating a sense of reality and reenacting the struggles and hardships the Italian people faced during this difficult time. The director was able to achieve this by using an variety of different cinematography techniques that placed the viewer in that situation so that they could better empathise with what was happening during the time. techniques such as deep focus enable the viewer to see the actor and what was happening in the foreground, but also able to capture in focus the devastating effects the war had on the city which was portrayed by mountains of rubble and debree. Dark and ominous lighting was used to set an undertone of disparity and gloom when the nazi scene’s were shown, and the use of drab and tattered clothing captured the difficultly and exhaustion people were facing during this time. And a variety of new found filming techniques such as Trucking, Dollying and Pedestaling were used with great success to capture the landscape and the tone of the scene, such as troops marching into town with lethal intent or a military truck being ambushed by the towns people to create a sense of hope.\n\nIn weeks four we explored the film Paisan which was directed by Roberto Rossellini- who was also the director of Rome, which explains why the two were film in the same neorealism film style. However the film Paisan was a collection of mini clips that related to the second world war, in particular the newly liberated Italian people and the American occupiers. even though both films were fairly different in many ways, they both used the norealistic film style which used the same cinematography techniques as listed above- which enable the viewer to empathise more deeply with what people were feeling and experiencing during that time.\n\nItalian Cinema and post WWII repercussions\n\nThroughout weeks one and two we explored a number of readings and videos that touched on the newaunces behind the development and downfall the second world war had on Italian cinema and the impact the Italian film industry had on creating a sense of patriotism and unity in a country that was devastated from the tirrany it faced from Nazi Germany. The film, ‘Cinema Paradiso’ was the first we watch which explored the Italian culture and the way of life many Italians lived whilst still under a Nazi regime and post war. Other themes included a great sense of family, friendship, romance, religion and above all community- but at the crux of it all was the Italian film industry and how it influenced the lives and experience of all the towns people.\n\nA great variety of cinematography techniques were used throughout the film and elaborated on during the reading, “Wagstaff Italian cinema”, which enable the neorealism film style to be so impactful. and influential on its viewers. for example, because the films were covering extreamly emotional and at times devastating topics of war and post war life, a complex variety cinematography techniques were used. Mid range panning camera shots were used to portray the devastation from bombings, deep focus shots were used to provide depth to the scenes and show how the chaos people getting bread and the rubble that surrenoude their town. there was an overtone of darkness and gloom what was achieved by low key lighting and dark fixtures and drab clothing. But the opposite was also used in scenes to present hope and joy which could be seen by montages of mid and close up angle shots of people laughing and enjoying films at the local cinema. In sum, a wide variety of cinematography techniques were used to enable to viewer to empathise with what the director was trying to portray. And in doing so enable the themes of romance, family, a sense of community, religion and more to be easily understood and empathised with, creating greater depth and authenticity to the film.\n\nTo give you some historical context when the film was first released, it was filmed in the neorealism style which meant a very authentic raw style which was fairly new at the time. At the time the film was very unpopular as it wasn’t an escape from the hardship the Italian people had just gone through. However, it was very popular internationally as it gave other people an insight into the other side of the war and the hardships people faced, which the neorealist film style encapsulated well. However, as time went by and these neorealist Italian films started to gather popularity the Italian community had a total change of heart and opened its doors to this new found way of Italian film style as it brought in a great deal of tourism, job opportunities and wealth for a country that was devastated from he second world war.\n\nbut as I write this post and reflect on both the film and the reading during weeks one and two I can’t but help ask myself…by re-enacting the terrible circumstance the Italian community faced during the second world war and the hardships and difficulties people faced, does it pay homage enough to those that had to live through it? or is it best to forget the past and move forward?\n\nhope you found this post interesting and engaging!!"
