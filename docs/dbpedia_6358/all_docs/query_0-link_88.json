        "text": "Yes… more neorealism.\n\nBut unlike Brief Encounter, Rossellini’s Paisan seems to benefit from his adoption of the neorealist aesthetic, to the point where I was about to write that, while the British film was fiction, Paisan is actually a documentary. It’s not, of course. It’s just as fictional as other films in the genre, it somehow feels real.\n\nPerhaps this is just a reflection of the great Italian’s filmmaking genius, or maybe the subject matter–Italy during WWII–lends itself to neorealism unlike any other time and place in history.\n\nThat second argument certainly made itself very present in Rossellini’s earlier neorealist movie on the same subject, Rome, Open City. But unlike Open City, Paisan does away with both politics and melodrama. It is a film composed of a series of vignettes that are extremely sad, but never falls into the typical trap of trying to drive the point of the character’s suffering into the audience with a sledgehammer. The situations are simply presented as they are, and the sadness often comes from the audience knowing more about the situation than the characters do.\n\nThe sparse approach to the material works perfectly, and though it doesn’t escape from the bane of realist art (namely, the sense that it just presents situations and answers no questions and offers no fulfillment), at least it isn’t maudlin realism, where you are invited to dwell upon the futility of existence and the fact that only suffering can break the monotony.\n\nSo, while this isn’t a film you’d watch to get your spirits up after a breakup, it’s still the apogee of neorealism and probably the only one you need to see to get a sense for the aesthetics and sensibilities of that particular postwar phenomenon. It will not uplift you, but it will edify.\n\nThe nicely weird thing we can report is that Rossellini’s three realist films were the ones that inspired Ingrid Bergman to write to him offering he services. While initially wanting to act for him, they eventually became the cover of the scandal sheets… in the fifties, two people who had a high-profile affair while married to others caused a lot of comment.\n\nOf course, eventually, Rossellini left Ingrid for another married woman, and caused an even bigger scandal (and got himself thrown out of India)… but that’s a story for another day.\n\nNever miss a post! Hit like on our Facebook page today!\n\nEven in Italy, a country that was, to a degree ravaged by both sides in WWII, the conflict eventually came to an end, and things went back to normal, even to the point where politically charged films could be made.\n\nOf course, the open wound that directors could stick their cameras into was the memory of the war itself and the deep divisions in Italian society. So for our next film from the 1001 films to see before you die, we give you Roma, Città Aperta (Rome, Open City), the first of Roberto Rossellini‘s Neorrealist films, and probably the most raw.\n\nIt’s a film about fear and loyalty–both extreme loyalty and the confused, divided kind–as well as about betrayal, and the cost of not being true.\n\nIt’s also a film about strange bedfellows in which we see a Catholic Priest share the fate of a Communist revolutionary, and women dying alongside their men.\n\nAll of these effects are heightened by how it looks. The lack of availability of adequate processing facilities as well as the difficulty in obtaining film stock means that the imagery isn’t of the quality one expected from the era; at times, it looks more like a war documentary filmed at the front than the output of a studio.\n\nThe one criticism that has been leveled against it is valid: this is more of a melodramatic piece than an unflinching slice of realism. But even that works in the film’s favor, making it more powerful than a pure expression of realist ideas could have achieved.\n\nBut powerful as what? This isn’t so much an anti-war film as one that decries the hypocrisy of humanity. I feel that, melodrama aside, it shrugs its shoulders at the way we are… and therein lies its ultimate success, and its capacity to be classified as neorrealist.\n\nIt’s impossible to analyze it further without spoilers, but this truly is a film that everyone should see. People haven’t changed since it was made, after all."
