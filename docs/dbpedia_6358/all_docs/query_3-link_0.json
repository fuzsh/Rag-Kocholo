        "text": "THE ADVENTURES OF ROBERTO ROSSELLINI\n\nBy Tag Gallagher.\n\nIllustrated. 802 pp. New York:\n\nDa Capo Press. Paper, $24.50.\n\nIn the preface to his biography of the Italian film director Roberto Rossellini, Tag Gallagher describes how, as a penniless young film buff, he slept outdoors in the rain and on any available floor over the course of three nights so that he could see Rossellini's three-part television movie, ''The Age of the Medici.'' Gallagher's extreme, even obsessive dedication to his subject informs much of ''The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini.'' He appears to have tracked down almost anyone connected to Rossellini -- every friend, relative, former girlfriend and professional collaborator. The result is an 802-page biography that is both exhaustive and exhausting.\n\nOn the positive side, we do generally learn a good deal about the circumstances under which Rossellini made his films. This is particularly useful in the long chapters Gallagher devotes to ''Rome, Open City'' and ''Paisan,'' which changed film history and virtually founded the genre of Italian Neorealism. These chapters are examples of how biography can contribute something important to one's understanding of major works of art.\n\nAt the same time, Gallagher's passionate attachment to his research occasionally makes the book prolix and indiscriminate. He appears to have fallen in love with his own research to a point where he is unwilling to part with even the smallest detail. We learn, for example, what the Rossellini family valet did during World War I, as well as what Rossellini ate when filming in India.\n\nAlthough Gallagher, the author of ''John Ford: The Man and His Films,'' is a worshipful partisan of Rossellini the filmmaker, he is fairly candid and detached about Rossellini's faults as a man. The portrait that emerges from these pages is of a charming and talented rogue who seduced producers and actresses, borrowed money shamelessly without the least intention of repaying it, left his servants unpaid on the theory that they should have felt lucky to work for such a great man. Although he talked endlessly about his position as a ''moral'' filmmaker, in his own life he behaved with colossal selfishness toward the women he kept seducing and the children he kept producing.\n\nRossellini's early life gave few signs of artistic promise. Born in 1906, the son of a wealthy Roman building contractor, he was an indifferent student who grew into a spoiled playboy. Rossellini liked fast cars, fast women and cocaine and spent his way through a substantial inheritance. When he ran out of money in the mid-1930's, he wandered almost accidentally into the Italian film industry on the strength of friendships and his appealing personality. Rossellini, like many in Italian film under Fascism, worked under the patronage of Vittorio Mussolini, Il Duce's oldest son, who had a passion for movies and the company of intellectuals. Although Rossellini made a few movies that could be described as Fascist propaganda, Vittorio Mussolini created an atmosphere of comparative tolerance and openness, light-years from the ideological ferocity that led to Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will.''\n\nNone of his early work, however, provides any genuine anticipation of the extraordinary breakthrough Rossellini achieved in 1945, with the making of ''Open City.'' The experience of the war, and especially the 10 long months in which the Germans occupied Rome, appeared to have been the turning point in his life and career. The German occupation -- during which Rome became a theater of mass arrests and narrow escapes, of desperate anti-Fascist resistance and bloody Nazi reprisals -- brought out previously unsuspected depths in Rossellini. He and some of his filmmaker friends, in particular the scriptwriter Sergio Amidei, conceived the idea of making a film about the German occupation as they waited for the Allies to arrive in Rome.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
