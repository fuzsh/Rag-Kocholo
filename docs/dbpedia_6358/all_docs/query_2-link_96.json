        "text": "The neorealism is an artistic and cultural movement that emerged in Italy in the early post-war years, especially in the field of cinema, but also in literature, painting and music.\n\nNeorealism developed in response to Italy’s post-war political and economic situation, characterized by the destruction of war, widespread poverty, unemployment, and disillusionment with politics and society.\n\nNeorealism tried to represent social and human reality in a raw and truthful way, staging stories of ordinary people and telling their lives and their daily difficulties. The movement was based on the use of non-professional actors, real settings and the elimination of special effects and editing tricks, in order to make the stories as close to reality as possible.\n\nItalian neorealistic cinema was influenced by Soviet cinema of the 20-30s and from the theories of the French director Jean Renoir. Between major directors of Italian neorealism we can mention Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini.\n\nNeorealism had a great impact on film history worldwide and influenced many subsequent directors, including the directors of the French New Wave in the 1960s. The movement also had a cultural and social impact in Italy, helping to bring forth a new social and political consciousness in the country.\n\nCHOOSE MOVIES TO WATCH\n\nWhen Was Neorealism Born?\n\nNeorealism in Italy was born in the period immediately following the end of the Second World War, i.e. at the end of the 1940s. The first film considered “neorealist” is “Ossessione” by Luchino Visconti, released in 1943, even if the real impetus to the movement came with “Rome, open city” by Roberto Rossellini, from 1945, which represented a turning point for Italian cinema and world. Neorealism developed mainly in the 1950s, until it declined at the end of the decade.\n\nWhy is it Called Neorealism?\n\nThe term “neorealism” derives from the fact that the directors and artists who were part of this movement tried to represent reality in the most faithful and authentic way possible, avoiding the artifices and styles typical of the previous cinema, which often fiction and aestheticization.\n\nThe prefix “neo” was added to indicate a break with the past and to highlight the innovative aspect of the movement, which represented a radical departure from the conventions and techniques of earlier cinema.\n\nIn summary, the name “neorealism” wants to underline the desire to represent reality in a new, different and authentic way, with respect to the conventions and rules of the past.\n\nWho Are the Main Exponents of Neorealism?\n\nItalian neorealism saw the participation of many directors, screenwriters, actors and artists of various disciplines, but some of the major exponents of the movement are as follows:\n\nRoberto Rossellini – director of “Roma, open city” (1945), “Paisà” (1946) and “Germania anno zero” (1948), considered among the masterpieces of Italian neorealism;\n\nVittorio De Sica – director of “Bicycle Thieves” (1948) and “Umberto D.” (1952), two films that represent the pinnacle of Italian neorealism;\n\nLuchino Visconti – director of “Ossessione” (1943) considered the first neorealist film, “La terra trema” (1948) and “Bellissima” (1951);\n\nFederico Fellini – director of “La strada” (1954) and “The nights of Cabiria” (1957), films which, although not strictly neorealist, take up their style and themes;\n\nCesare Zavattini – screenwriter and critic, collaborator of many neorealist directors, including De Sica and Rossellini, and author of important theoretical writings on movement.\n\nThese artists, together with other exponents of neorealism, have contributed to creating a new way of making cinema and of representing the post-war Italian reality, leaving an indelible mark on the history of world cinema.\n\nCHOOSE MOVIES TO WATCH\n\nNeorealism in Literature\n\nNeorealism in literature was a cultural and artistic movement that originated in Italy in the late 1940s, simultaneously with cinematic neorealism. It represents the continuation of 19th century Italian realism, but with a new focus on post-war events and social problems.\n\nNeorealist writers tried to represent social reality in a direct and truthful way, without idealizations or idealisms, using simple and everyday language. Among the major exponents of neorealism in literature we can mention Vasco Pratolini, Italo Calvino, Alberto Moravia, Cesare Pavese, Elio Vittorini and Ignazio Silone.\n\nThe thematic of neorealism in literature centered on the difficulties and sufferings of the daily life of ordinary people, with particular attention to the economic, social and political problems of post-war Italy. Neorealist novels and plays often portrayed the lives of poor people, workers, peasants, the unemployed, refugees and war veterans.\n\nThe neorealist novels, such as those of Pavese and Moravia, were characterized by a strong psychological introspection of the characters, while those of Pratolini and Vittorini concentrated on the description of the environment and the characters of the popular world. Overall, literary neorealism had an important cultural and social impact in Italy and contributed to the formation of national consciousness and the fight against social injustices.\n\nWhat Are the Characteristics of Neorealism?\n\nThe main characteristics of neorealism are as follows:\n\nRealism: neorealism is characterized by the representation of reality in a raw and truthful way, without idealizations or aestheticizations, and with particular attention to the difficulties and sufferings of ordinary people.\n\nSetting: Neorealism takes place mainly in real and everyday environments, such as city streets, the countryside, public housing and factories.\n\nNon-professional actors: Neo-realist films often use non-professional actors, chosen from ordinary people, to give greater authenticity and realism to the performances.\n\nDocumentary Style: Neorealism uses a documentary style, with location shooting, natural lighting, and minimal editing, to create a feeling of reality.\n\nSocial issues: Neorealism deals with social issues such as poverty, unemployment, war, hunger and social inequalities.\n\nSocial criticism: neorealism expresses a strong social criticism, denouncing injustice and inequality, and calling for solidarity and social emancipation.\n\nHumanity of the characters: neorealist characters are often ordinary people, human and vulnerable, who have to struggle with the difficulties of life.\n\nWhy Did Neorealism End?\n\nNeorealism had a short but intense season, which extended from about 1943 to 1952, and which was characterized by a strong civil, social and political commitment. However, at the end of the 1950s, neorealism lost its driving force and a new model of cinema and culture gradually took hold.\n\nThere are various reasons that brought about the end of neorealism, including:\n\nPolitical change: the end of the 40s and the beginning of the 50s were characterized by a political change in Italy, with the advent of Christian democracy and the birth of the economic miracle. These changes have led to a decrease in the political and social commitment of filmmakers and writers, and to an increase in interest in modernization and technological innovation.\n\nAesthetic turning point: the end of the 1950s saw the emergence of a new model of cinema and culture, characterized by greater attention to forms and technique, and by greater interest in the international public. This new model has led to a gradual marginalization of neorealism, considered too realistic and too tied to the Italian reality.\n\nEvolution of taste: the Italian and international public began to look for a more accessible and entertaining cinema and literature, which responded to the needs of escapism and entertainment. This tendency has led to a gradual disinterest in neorealism, considered too demanding and too tied to reality.\n\nIn summary, the end of neorealism was determined by a combination of political, aesthetic and cultural factors, which led to a progressive change in the tastes and needs of the public.\n\nCHOOSE MOVIES TO WATCH\n\nNeorealist Films to Watch\n\nHere is a list of Neorealism films, masterpieces to watch absolutely:\n\nObsession (1943)\n\nObsession is a 1943 film directed by Luchino Visconti, considered one of the masterpieces of Italian cinema and one of the forerunners of Neorealism.\n\nThe film is based on the novel “The Postman Always Rings Twice” by James M.

The film was well received by critics and is considered one of Visconti’s best works.\n\nThe plot of the film follows Maddalena (played by Magnani), a mother determined to make her daughter Maria a great film actress. Maddalena is a simple woman of humble origins, but she aspires to make her daughter successful and does not hesitate to make sacrifices to do so. She presents herself to an audition for her daughter, who is rejected due to her too young age, but Maddalena continues to look for ways to make her a star.\n\nThe film explores themes such as vanity, the aspiration for immortality through art and the world of cinema, which is shown as a cynical and ruthless environment. The character of Maddalena represents the figure of the stereotypical Italian mother, obsessed with her children’s success and willing to do anything to make her dreams come true.\n\nAnna Magnani’s performance was highly praised and she won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952. The film was also nominated for the Palme d’Or at Cannes that year.\n\nCHOOSE MOVIES TO WATCH\n\nUmberto D.
