        "text": "Paisan (1946, Italy)\n\nKnown instead as Paisá in Italy, Paisan is the second film in Roberto Rossellini's informal Italian neorealist trilogy. Of the three films in this trilogy, Paisan is often regarded as the weakest of the three. Not helping it is the fact that the film is divided into six distinct episodes chronicling the Allied invasion of the Italian mainland. As this is my first Rossellini film, I must admit I won't be as incisive as I should - all my knowledge of Italian neorealism stems from De Sica and early Fellini.\n\nPaisan was Rossellini's twelfth film but only beginning last year was he approaching the height of his talents. No longer artistically shackled by the regime of Benito Mussolini, Rossellini became the father of Italian neorealism with Rome, Open City (the first in this unofficial trilogy) the previous year. That film as well as Paisan established the elements that people associate with the movement - non-professional actors and on-location shooting due to a lack of sound stages.\n\nThe six episodes go in the following order: a brief encounter between an American soldier and a local during the invasion of Sicily (see picture), a drunk military policeman's (MP) relationship with an orphaned boy after the Allies capture Napoli, a story of lost love following the liberation of Rome, a nurse's journey to find her lover in a Fiorentina still partly occupied by Nazi troops, three American chaplains staying a night at a Roman Catholic monastery (all of the Italian monks - who had never before acted in a film - would be recast in Rossellini's 1950 film The Flowers of St. Francis), and a small band of Allied troops working with Italian Partisans (the resistance movement).\n\nMy personal favorite was the fourth episode with the American nurse trying to find her lover in Fiorentina. I also believe a young Giulietta Masina has a small role in that episode (she had already married co-writer and future auteur Federico Fellini by this time).\n\nSaid Rossellini of his film:\n\nIn Paisá, there were two worlds which came into contact, each with a different psychology and mental structure. From this contact was born a great confusion; so much so that in the end there were neither victors nor vanquished, there remained only the everyday heroism of the man who clings to life. And who lives, despite everything, whether he is one of the victors or one of the vanquished.\n\nIt is almost as if Rossellini is telling stories of wartime Italy for the sake of telling those stories. For the second, third, and fifth episodes in particular, there is almost no drama and these episodes seem to exist for their own sake. Such perhaps was the disillusionment and alienation war brought on not just the Italian civilians, but the Allied troops. For this first-time Rossellini viewer, this experience in itself is incredibly alienating. I have yet to see or review the rest of his filmography, so I wonder whether this style of refusing to heighten the drama to peer into some of the more mundane or private of moments will be a staple of Rossellini's.\n\nRossellini sacrifices drama - which could be seen as maudlin given the filmic movement and film subject matter - for authenticity. I believe Paisan to be the most authentic Neorealist film I've yet to see. I can not recall many other films devoid of emotional manipulation and imbued with a steadfast refusal to create drama for the purpose of being dramatic.\n\nAnother aspect which might link the six vignettes together is that the relationships established in each one never culminate to a satisfying end - some of these episodes in particular end quite abruptly. The fractured nature of these relationships is an extension of the fractured narrative structure of this film. And though some of these stories were quite personal, it is for these narrative and filmic fractures I was never able to immerse myself personally or filmically into the piece.\n\nThe film suffered production hell as post-war Italy was difficult - finding locations and managing in between frequent power outages proved to be overwhelming at times. But this production hell proved to be healthy for the film. As they found more and more locations during filming, Rossellini and his writers had the latter five episodes heavily improvised. These improvisations include the cave inhabited by homeless families in the Napoli sequence, the entire monastery episode, and the entirety of the sequence in Fiorentina. Again, this all adds to the film's authenticity - which will jar many.\n\nCo-written by an international team of authors and screenwriters, Sergio Amidei, Klaus Mann, Federico Fellini, Marcello Pagliero, Alfred Hayes, and Vasco Pratolini are the film's six co-screenwriters. With Rossellini at the director's helm, one could only imagine the artistic deliberations this team made during the latter five episodes.\n\nComposer Renzo Rossellini (Roberto's brother) is said to have rushed his film score and it shows. I don't say this often, but there is an annoying lack of restraint as the score - at many crucial moments - is far too loud and finds itself interfering with the film's narrative.\n\nMet with a hostile reception in Italy (the Italians were sick to death of realistic war stories as they were rebuilding their lives), the film achieved box-office and critical redemption in Western Europe and became an early art house favorite in the United States. Now seen as one of Rossellini's best films, it was a sensation (as far as foreign language films can be sensational in America) among awards ceremonies. It would win Best Director and Best Film from the National Board of Review and the writing team would be nominated for Oscars.\n\nA personal favorite of Martin Scorsese's, Paisan did not quite resonate as much to me. I feel my lack of experience with Rossellini and lack of life experience was a detriment to my viewing of Paisan and thus I am giving the film a conservative rating. Without a doubt, I look forward to the rest of Rossellini's filmography.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\n^ Based on my personal imdb rating."
