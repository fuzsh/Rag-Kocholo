        "text": "Paisan (Paisà, meaning “[Fellow] Countryman”) is the second of Roberto Rossellini’s trilogy of 1946 Italian neorealist war drama films. There are six episodes in all. They take place during the Italian campaign of World Fight II, when Nazi Germany was losing the war to the Allies. Communication issues caused by linguistic difficulties are a key subject. Both the Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from Any Source were nominated for the film. It was the most successful Italian film of 1945-46, ending ahead of Mario Mattoli’s dramatic Life Begins Anew."
