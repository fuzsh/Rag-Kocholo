First I must acknowledge the ﬁne work and the patience of the contributors, colleagues and friends whose essays appear in this volume. They spent time and energy in corresponding with me during a span of ﬁve years, and they never complained. Secondly, I want to thank the internal and external readers whose thorough reports stand as proof to the intensive work that members of our profession perform anonymously and all too often without the proper recognition and remuneration. I am especially indebted to Dr. Millicent Marcus and to Dr. Mark Pietralunga for taking the time to write nice reviews of the present work. A special thanks goes to Dr. Erec Koch, Chair of the Department of Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures, who has always been very supportive and encouraging of my endeavors and to the University of Tennessee for granting a sabbatical leave that allowed me to ﬁnish this project in a timely manner and for helping in the copy editing of the manuscript. I also am indebted to the many colleagues (Dr. Sal DiMaria, Dr. David Fairservice, Dr. Susanna Delﬁno etc.) who read the chapters during various phases of the writing process and whose comments I treasured. My special gratitude also goes to Edgar Miller, my copy editor, whose long experience in the ﬁeld of editing made the navigation through the maze of publishing regulations a more pleasant sailing.\n\nxii\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Dr. Paolo Ciarlo of the Letimbro Computers, because without his technological support and expertise, during my staying in Italy, the completion of this project would have been very diﬃcult if not impossible.\n\nINTRODUCTION Flavia Brizio-Skov\n\nThe idea of this volume stems from the desire of four scholars to collaborate on their similar research interests. We felt the need to read and interpret Italian popular culture and cinema against the grain, and the urge to dispel the lingering misconception that has considered any form of popular culture as edible entertainment for the masses. We believe that culture is the expression of a particular way of life, and the cultural analysis of the texts produced at the time is a way to reconstitute, reconstruct and recapture that particular way of life.1 Popular texts such as songs, ﬁlms, rituals succeed only when they meet the emotional requirements of the popular audience. Obviously the lived culture of a particular time and place is accessible only to those living in that time and place, but the recorded culture, from art to everyday facts, is the culture of a period. There is only one factor connecting lived culture and period culture, the culture of the selective tradition: the forming of the canon. However, a great deal is lost between the lived culture and its reconstitution via cultural analysis because the selection is based on contemporary interests, and therefore the relevance of past works is always, to a certain extent, unforeseeable. The canon often excludes large portions of the texts. Sometimes, they get included much later. But even when that happens, the damage is often diﬃcult to repair, not because of the everlasting eﬀect of the disparaging opinions of the critics, but because, as has happened with the Italian genre cinema, the critics for years\n\n2\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nforgot these products, they glossed over them, they ignored them, they lumped them together into the infamous category of popular entertainment, and the stigma seems to be permanent. Serious studies of the western Italian style, for example, did not appear till the mid 1980s, almost two decades after these ﬁlms ceased to be produced, and for that reason, even to this day, such texts have not yet been granted a complete rehabilitation. The present work, therefore, wants to re-evaluate the past, showing how popular cinema was not one of evasion and of escapism, but, rather, a cinema in tune with the political and social changes that occurred in Italy at the time: a cinema that kept alive and thriving the old, conservative values of the prewar monarchic-fascist Italietta, and also a cinema that registered ahead of time the turmoil and the rebellion that was going to aﬄict Italy in the 1960s and 1970s. The chapters of this volume underscore the discrepancy between the popular genre cinema that met the emotional requirement of the audience and was greatly appreciated by the public, and the critics who misjudged it for ideological and political reasons. Most of these studies not only deal with the subject matter in depth, but also span across a vast cultural horizon so that they can really be considered exhaustive on the subject in question. We are conﬁdent that this volume will contribute greatly to the ﬁeld of both Italian cultural studies and cinema studies for the novelty of the critical approaches and the variety of the subjects. The groundbreaking nature of this work is testiﬁed by its ability to show how important the study of genres is for Italian cinema, how essential it is to show that, on the one hand, the texts in question attempt to win the reader to a particular world view and, on the other, how the same texts, rituals and customs, bind together the social order, in a sort of Althusserian way, oﬀering pleasure and relief from its demands. We also point out how many of these texts and rituals manage to somehow achieve a plurality of messages that range from the more conservative and pro-establishment to the more rebellious and pro-revolutionary, therefore constituting a family of hybrid texts. Starting from these premises, John Storey claims that all texts are ultimately political, because they oﬀer competing ideological signiﬁcations of the way the world is.2 Every text, therefore attempts to\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nentice the reader to see the world in a particular way; it tries to push the reader/spectator in a particular direction. Basically all texts are ideological or, put another way, culture and ideology often cover the same ground. Therefore, this study of popular culture and cinema aims at reconstructing all the inescapable relations of power and politics that mark the culture/ideology of a speciﬁc time, both nationally and internationally. The so-called “formula cinema,” or genre cinema, is used as a tool to penetrate successfully into a large portion of our culture. According to Gramsci’s hegemony theory, popular culture is the site of the struggle between the forces of resistance of subordinate groups and the forces of incorporation associated with dominant groups in society.3 Texts and practices of popular culture as a result move between two poles, resistance and incorporation, and also between the discourse of the text and the discourse of the reader, who brings his own cultural formation and his historical moment to the reading. This is because, as Benjamin suggests, the meaning of a cultural text is produced at consumption not at production. Of course, there is always a discrepancy between the use of a text or practice by the public and the use intended by the producers. Cinema is a highly proﬁtable commercial enterprise, and as a consequence we need to keep in mind that a ﬁlmic text tends to mirror attitudes and sentiments that are already there consciously and/or unconsciously, but, on the other hand, we cannot forget that it also tends to create new areas in which these attitudes can be projected. The popular ﬁlmic texts analyzed in this volume tell us not so much, for example, about ancient mythology (peplum ﬁlms) or the Far West (spaghetti western): They tell us about the people who created them and the society that enjoyed them. Moreover, the present book ﬁts into a smaller and less populated area of cultural studies that comprises those works that study Italian culture, but are written in English. The number of publications in the English-speaking world on cultural studies is enormous, especially because cultural studies was born in Birmingham, England, and then migrated successfully throughout the Anglo-Saxon world and to the United States and Australia. However, cultural studies did not spread with the same speed to the rest of Europe. In Italy, the persistent Crocean heritage of the division between “low” and “high”\n\n4\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nculture delayed the development of this kind of work. Nowadays, nevertheless, cultural studies thrive in Italy. Besides the pioneering work by Umberto Eco (Apocalittici e integrati, 1964) and now Dal Lago’s body of work (Descrizione di una battaglia. Rituali del calcio, 1990), to cite the most well-known examples, there are many contributions to this ﬁeld (in Italian usually occurring under the umbrella of Scienze della Comunicazione).4 However, because the production of Italian cultural studies written in English is not a vast one, we would like to map it, following chronologically the appearance of the most signiﬁcant books from 1990 on, hoping to create a niche that would make manifest the contribution of the present study to the ﬁeld. In 1990 Baranski and Lumley edited a volume entitled Culture and Conﬂict in Postwar Italy that is a touchstone for Italian cultural studies written in English.5 The book analyzes the cultural transformations that happened in Italy starting from the Second World War, concentrating on key words such as “mass,” “popular” and “culture.” “Culture” is interpreted in an anthropological sense as a “way of life” and not as a separate sphere of human activity. The book is divided into ﬁve parts that deal respectively with history (history, culture, language), catholic and communist subcultures (religion, politics, social movements), role of the intellectuals (mass culture and intellectuals), commercial cinema (cinema and design in postwar Italy) and television. The two editors make an interesting distinction between “mass culture” and “popular culture,” comparing the English deﬁnitions with the Italian ones: cultura di massa and cultura popolare. Usually cultura di massa means everything that is produced in society for hegemonic goals in a Marxist sense, or, better, everything that is “fed to the masses,” while cultura popolare has a positive Gramscian connotation and should be read as “culture of the people, born from the people for the people.” Therefore, cultura popolare would be the culture that opposes the elitist culture of the dominant classes, and, at least in the ﬁrst decade of the postwar period the leftist intellectuals tried to promote a culture that could prevent the eﬀects of homogenization caused by the mass culture imported from the United States. Lumley and Baranski, on the other hand, also aﬃrm that Italian culture becomes “mass culture” in the years that follow the economic boom of 1958–63. We could not agree more with this\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nstatement. In this study, in fact, we have based our analysis of the ﬁlmic texts keeping in mind Spinazzola’s distinction between cinema popolare and cinema di massa. Spinazzola says that “the works targeting the consumption of the lower classes belong to popular cinema; mass cinema instead is aimed at the uniﬁcation of the audience, both upper and lower classes, and it is in a certain way classless.”6 We can for that reason conclude that after the economic boom (1958–63) the distinction between popular and mass culture is no longer possible in Italy. See, for example, the pepla ﬁlms of the 1950s that still fall into Spinazzola’s category of cultura popolare (i.e. ﬁlms fed to the lower classes) while the spaghetti western of the 1960s are already “mass culture,” a product appealing to men and women of any class, bourgeoisie and proletariat. Before entering more deeply into the mapping of this cultural ﬁeld, we need to make a brief diversion and talk about the pioneering works of Umberto Eco. It is impossible to talk about Italian cultural studies without coming to terms with Umberto Eco’s legacy. Apocalittici e integrati published in 1964 is an international point of reference in the study of mass culture. Eco’s book was a revolutionary text. It managed to defeat the widespread hostility on the part of Italian intellectuals (from left and as well as right) toward the socalled homogenization of the American-led invasion of mass culture, or against the invasion of low culture at the expense of real culture, where real should be read as high culture, i.e., the expression of the highest form of the human spirit as in the works of the great masters (the “canon”). Eco tried to look anthropologically at cultural production. Shultz’s cartoons, the comic strip of Superman, television programs etc., are seen as products of a certain culture that can reveal a lot about itself. Eco also never forgets that behind production there is also distribution and consumption. From the 1960s on, Eco extensively dealt with “mass culture” from a theoretical point of view, studying those texts which portray the Manichean opposition between Good and Evil; concentrating his attention on comic or ﬁlmic characters that, being divided into neat, simple and opposed categories, give life to a cultural production that, according to the critic, negates the complexity of reality. See the happy ending of many ﬁlmic texts which convey a falsely ordered\n\n6\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nview of the world, negating its complexity, as well as the continuous becoming of history. Eco deconstructs the “signs” to reveal the ideological eﬀects of mass communication, in opposition to which there are the “open works,” i.e., those texts that break the norm and open themselves to multiple interpretations and, in so doing, question the real, uncovering its hidden meanings.7 In 1994, David Forgacs published Italian Culture in the Industrial Era.8 In this important work, the author examined the long-term development of the culture industries, and their relations with the state. His study is a brief but interesting history of the cultural modernization of Italy in the century after 1880. Forgacs focuses mostly on the development of the industries engaged in the production and distribution of cultural products, such as books, newspapers, magazines, ﬁlms, radio and television. He contends that, even if it is common belief that mass culture arrived in Italy with the economic boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, there are scholars who believe that the phenomenon started in 1880 with the ﬁrst wave of industrialization and that another followed in the 1930s with the advent of radio. Forgacs reinserts the study of products and producers within the circuit production-distribution-consumption, with an emphasis on the linkages between cultural industries and political power from the turn of the nineteenth century to the 1970s. He bases his study on three notions: that social consent is actively organized by cultural means in civil society and not just by legitimation by the state (political society); that social cohesion works through a cementing together of blocks or alliances of diﬀerent social groups rather than being the work of a single dominant class; and that these blocks need to be actively constructed. Because they are impermanent, they can be destabilized and re-stabilized by changing the relations of force within and outside society. According to Forgacs, the study of culture has been heavily conditioned by politics in Italy because from the very beginning the dominant parties managed to control public broadcasting, making it evident that the ones who own and control the cultural industries remain in power. This, as a consequence, has also impeded the development of a cultural studies approach. Italian Cultural Studies—An Introduction (1996), edited by Forgacs and Lumley, opened up the ﬁeld of cultural research, giving\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nthe scholar of cultural studies a wider horizon.9 The book is divided in parts that cover subjects as seemingly diverse as anthropological ﬁeldworks (geographies, political identities, gender relations), media (press, cinema, television), fashion and music (culture and society). The contributors carefully avoided any rankings between high and low culture, and looked at a variety of cultural materials, always keeping in mind that culture is a set of signifying practices and symbolic social forms, looking at it from the standpoint of the dominated classes and not from the side of the dominant classes. Between 1996 and today many collaborative studies on Italian cultural have been published. I will mention only some of these works, not because the remaining ones are not interesting—quite the contrary—but because these collections often cover the same topics, from cinema to fashion, from problems of national identities to cuisine, from literature to religion, from language to sport. Therefore, for obvious reasons, it would be impossible to analyze in detail this varied production. From all these volumes I want to single out The Cambridge Companion to Modern Italian Culture (2001), edited by Baranski and West, which oﬀers a good perspective on the multifaceted complexity of modern Italian culture.10 If, on one hand, its thematic richness can run the risk of fragmenting the general discourse, on the other hand, this richness prevents the compartmentalization of the topics. As Baranski and West say in the Introduction: “In a book which attempts to provide an introduction to ‘modern Italian culture,’ both Rossellini the ﬁlm maker and Berlusconi the media entrepreneur have to be found a niche.”11 That is to say that the selection tries to keep a balanced mixture of high and low culture. The same would be true for Italian Cultural Studies (2001), another collaborative book edited by Parati and Lawton. Here the material is divided into two sections, a more theoretical one and more practical one; the key word of the volume is “interdisciplinary” in order to, as the editors point out, “explore new methodologies in deﬁning a culture as a set of intertwining strategies and of inter-relations.”12 There is a group of volumes dealing with Italian cultural studies that oﬀer collections of essays written both in Italian and in English. In 1998 Annali d’Italianistica dedicated its entire Volume 16 to Italian cultural studies. Quoting Lawrence Grossberg et al. in his\n\n8\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nthoughtful Forward, Dombroski states that the main problem aﬀecting the area of cultural studies has been the lack of a discourse that shares “a commitment to examining cultural practices from the point of view of their intricacies with, and, within relations of power,”13 including the relations of power that the critic himself has within those relations. He points out the necessity of establishing some markers to a ﬁeld that runs the risk of becoming “anything anyone wants.”14 We could not agree more with Dombroski’s warning. In writing the present essays, in fact, we have kept in mind that culture and ideology coincide. In 2003 Antonio Vitti and Roberta Morosini edited In Search of Italia — Saggi sulla cultura dell’Italia contemporanea.15 Three out of the 12 essays are in English, the rest are in Italian. These studies are written by scholars who, facing the many ideological and political changes that have occurred in Italy since the advent of the Second Republic (1992), try to understand a nation that, for some of them who emigrated abroad, remains a puzzle. The authors are, therefore, motivated by scholarly interests and by a desire to make sense of the intense cultural, political, and social modiﬁcations that Italy has been undergoing in the recent past. The topics are varied and concentrate on contemporary culture: from Francesco Guccini’s novels to the national Bicycle Tour (Giro d’Italia), from contemporary cinema to the status of the spoken language of today etc. In the same year, Vitti also edited another volume, Incontri con il cinema italiano. In the Preface, Vitti indicates that he wants to re-direct the attention of the reader away from the traditional cinematic canon, i.e., away from the production of the great masters such as Antonioni, Visconti, De Sica, Fellini, Pasolini, Bertolucci, toward a blending of cinema and cultural studies, in order to examine the “historical landscape” of Italy through the lens of cinema from its origins to the present. Many of the essays (both in English and in Italian) deal with ﬁlms of contemporary directors who focus on immigration and political corruption, as well as the many economic problems from which the national cinematic industry suﬀers today. In 2005, Anthony Tamburri edited Italian Cultural Studies 2002.16 Tamburri, quoting Stuart Hall in his introduction, makes clear that cultural studies is a mode of analysis which takes at its focal point\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\n“the changing way of life of societies and groups and the networks of meanings that individuals and groups use to make sense of and to communicate with each other.”17 He stresses the intertwining and inter-relations of everything that pertains to culture, specifying that cultural studies is not a “mere description of the cultural emergent that aim to give voice to the ‘experience’ of those who have been denied a space to talk,”18 but an explanation that will foster change in the conditions that have blocked those voices from talking. The political stance of cultural studies could not be stated more clearly, together with the premise that cultural studies breaks the traditional boundaries among the disciplines, because it is interdisciplinary in nature, and as a consequence it presupposes a study of a broad context or of the “cultural cluster” into which the particular text is studied. According to Tamburri, globalization, multiculturalism, interdisciplinarity are the key terms of cultural studies, now that all the planet’s societies are linked in a world system and enmeshed in a global movement of diﬀerence and power. In 2006 Norma Bouchard edited Negotiating Italian Identities as a special issue of the journal Annali d’Italianistica entirely devoted to exploring the dynamics of Italian identities from the postwar period to the present.19 The volume is a selection of articles written in English and in Italian. As the title suggests, and as Bouchard states in her opening essay, “Negotiating Italian Identities,” cultural studies has “placed the issue of identity at the core of its enquiry, conceptualizing it as a continuous set of ever-evolving subject positions negotiated and articulated within the wider contexts and sites of acculturation that are available to us at any given stage of our personal and public histories.”20 The dramatic economic, social and political transformations that have aﬀected Italy since its formation in 1860 and up to the Second Republic (1992) presented a panorama in which particularistic identity formations appeared, last but not least the new subnational identities such as the emergence of the Lega Nord and Lega Lombarda. Local, national and supranational identities are explored in relation to high- and low-print culture, media culture, patterns of consumption of everyday life, ritualized forms of behavior and lifestyles, sites of memory and forgetfulness. Some of these studies investigate processes of identities in relation to large socio-political\n\n10\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\ndevelopments, others in relation to diasporic, regional, gendered, class and generational changes using diverse methodologies. If some of the scholars address issues connected with formalizations of identities propelled by modern industrialization, the cultural revolution of 1968, the rise of the Leghe and of supra-national communities, and the immigration to Italy from abroad, others discuss symbolic practices from fashion to popular music, from documentaries to journalism. We hope that the overview of the above volumes will help the reader to situate the present study within the ﬁeld of Italian cultural studies and, at the same time, we trust that this overview will make evident the many points of contact and of departure from the above mentioned works and will highlight our contribution to the ﬁeld, having covered some new ground. In writing the essays we tried to appeal to a wide audience, ranging from students to specialists of Italian cultural studies. The reader will notice that in our essays we are more interested in the reception rather than in the production of mass popular culture; therefore, we concentrated on the reception of popular genre cinema and on speciﬁc cultural phenomena following a chronological approach. For this reason we started in the 1950s with the sword-and-sandal epics, and we progressed from there, tracing the development of popular genre cinema through the decades: the horror, the spaghetti western and the birth of the comedy Italian style. We also felt the need to study a popular ritual, tarantismo, from its origins to the present, as an example, in a Gramscian sense, of cultura popolare nata dal popolo per il popolo (popular culture born from the people for the people). The last section deals with violence and comprises two types of violence: violence in the western genre and violence against women. We felt the urge to deal with violence because on the one hand it is the intrinsic and inescapable ﬁber that holds together the history of the western genre, and because on the other, in spite of the sexual revolution, the onset of feminism, and the advent of the so-called “emancipation of women,” the problem persists in Italian society. We decided to look at what kind of “image of woman” these ﬁlms created at the symbolic level. Popular Genre Cinema In “The Italian Sword-and-Sandal Cinema from Fabiola (1949) to\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nHercules and the Captive Women (1961): Texts and Contexts,” Frank Burke addresses a genre (the sword-and-sandal ﬁlm) and a ﬁlone (strand) or sub-genre (the pseudo-mythical Italian peplum of the late 1950s and early 1960s) in such a way as to reveal how the issues and meanings generated within a seemingly repeatable formula change according to the historical and cultural moments in which examples of that formula arise. He discusses how, for instance, a 1949 ﬁlm, Fabiola, diﬀers markedly in tone, characterization, and subject matter from two 1962 pepla, The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women, because of the historical and cultural landscape from which they emerge. In so doing, he links what seems to be a relatively insigniﬁcant popular culture phenomenon to major shifts in Italy and in the conﬂuence of Italian and American cultural politics following the Second World War. His approach is interdisciplinary, embodying issues of history, culture, politics, ideology, gender, genre, sexual orientation, production, and reception, in the context of ﬁlm textual analysis. The essay insists that meaning arises only within a cultural ﬁeld, and focuses on the relationship of cultural production to power (the politics of the sword-and-sandal ﬁlm, as it were). Finally, the essay as a whole strongly focuses on popular culture and, in particular, on a cluster of ﬁlms (the pepla) that undermine the classics by treating Greek mythology and history with the utmost irreverence, thus unsettling the boundaries between high and low culture. In “Horror Cinema: the Emancipation of Women and Urban Anxiety,” Andrea Bini analyzes the birth, evolution, and decline of the horror genre in Italian cinema in the postwar years and the way in which this cinema incorporated the changes of Italian society. The ﬁrst decade (1956–66) is characterized by Gothic ﬁlms, in which, instead of traditional male monsters and villains, sexually active women (vampire-witches) become the forces menacing the patriarchal system. The female monster is the outcome of a crisis experienced by a rural society uprooted by the economic boom and the frantic modernization of the 1950s and the early 1960s. The Italian horror ﬁlm undergoes a rebirth in the 1970s with the Italian giallo, and its contemporary settings and explicit gore (1969–77). Bini shows how this unexpected commercial achievement cannot be explained by looking only at male anxiety due to the spreading of sexual liberation and\n\n12\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nfeminist movements; instead, it should be examined with an eye on the growing urban anxiety caused by the transformation of the Italian cities into anonymous megalopolis between 1969 and 1979. Flavia Brizio-Skov, in “Dollars, Bullets, and Success: The Spaghetti Western Phenomenon,” puts in motion a rehabilitation of the western Italian style, trying to ﬁnd the reasons behind the enormous success of the spaghetti western, a phenomenon that clearly goes beyond the narrow label of edible mass consumption product. There are many studies on the spaghetti westerns, ﬁrst of all the seminal volume written by Sir Christopher Frayling titled Spaghetti Westerns.21 However, an in-depth analysis of the phenomenal success of this genre has not yet appeared. What is required is a close look at the socio-political ﬁber of Italy as well as making hypotheses on the ideological tendencies of the audience of the time. The goal of this chapter is to provide convincing explanations of how these ﬁlms satisﬁed the sense of rebellion and the rite of passage from nineteenth century conservativemonarchic-fascist values to the modern capitalistic values created by the sudden industrialization of the country in the 1960s, and how these apparently contradictory elements met the expectations of a large spectrum of spectators. In “The Birth of the Comedy Italian Style,” Andrea Bini focuses, in the context of postwar Italian cinema, on the beginning of the most successful Italian genre (or sub-genre) of the 1960s: the commedia all’italiana (comedy Italian style). Going against mainstream critical opinion that situates this cinematic production in the wake of Neorealismo Rosa (Rosy Neorealism), a series of light, happy-ending comedies of the 1950s commonly considered its direct forerunners, Bini demonstrates how this critical view does not account for the biting satire of the commedia all’italiana. The predecessors of this genre must be found in other, much bleaker comedies of the 1940s and early 1950s directed by Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini and Mario Monicelli. This cinematic production—as well as other ﬁlms starring the young actor Alberto Sordi—created on screen the image of a country whose social bonds had collapsed after the war, a country in which the intense process of industrialization and urbanization due to the “economic miracle” had created high levels of social distress, favoring the formation of a new breed of self-indulgent and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nopportunistic Italian males. Unsurprisingly, the ﬁrst comedies Italian style became box-oﬃce successes and established themselves as a special genre only in the 1960s. In these years, in fact, they found a large audience in the new urban middle-class that was willing to laugh at itself insofar as it saw itself as the leading protagonist of the new prosperity. Ritual and Cinema Flavia Laviosa, in “Tarantula Myths and Music: Popular Culture and Ancient Rituals in Italian Cinema,” examines Southern Italian tarantism, a fascinating ritual with mythical-symbolic and magic-religious aspects that has generated interest for centuries. The historical, anthropological and ethno-musicological overview of the present-day rituals connected with this ancient phenomenon illustrates the topic from a composite cultural studies perspective. This chapter oﬀers an in-depth analysis of the stylistic and thematic choices of feature and documentary ﬁlms portraying tarantism. More speciﬁcally, the author examines the ﬁlms Flavia, the Heretic (Flavia, la monaca musulmana, 1974) by Gianfranco Mingozzi; La sposa di San Paolo (1990; no English title available) by Gabriella Rosaleva; Pizzicata (1996) and Life Blood (Sangue vivo, 2000) by Edoardo Winspeare. Although tarantism is extinct today, the myth of the spider is re-interpreted through music festivals and theater performances in the Salento region. Laviosa explores how and why the music and dance pizzica have exploded in the past 20 years, thus generating the artistic expressions of new-tarantism. Finally, the author focuses on whether this current popularity of tarantism is only the result of commercial exploitation, or if it is the product of the reappropriation of Southern Italian popular culture by the people. Violence and Cinema Brizio-Skov continues her analysis of the spaghetti western in “Popular Cinema and Violence: The Western Genre.” Starting from the point of view that a complete rehabilitation of the spaghetti western is not possible without its insertion into the genesis of the western genre, the author demonstrates that the western Italian style is not really a sub-genre, but an indispensable moment in the development of\n\n14\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nthe whole genre. With its innovations the spaghetti western changes the classic western formula, allowing the birth of the post-western. The subversive qualities of the spaghetti western, with its altering of the classic western justiﬁcation of violence, has not been studied suﬃciently. This essay seeks to help ﬁll that void by demonstrating how the American post-westerns of today would not exist without Sergio Leone’s ﬁlms and the ﬁlms of his best followers. The spaghetti western’s transformation of the concept of violence, a fundamental ingredient of any western ﬁlm, has facilitated the genre re-reading of the history of America. This transformation has opened profound gaps in the monolithic faith of the American concept of justice, triggering a shift in ideological perspective that is evident in the postwesterns, a shift that begins with Sam Peckinpah’s seminal ﬁlm, The Wild Bunch (1969), and continues to the present. In “Women’s Drama, Men’s Business: Sexual Violence Against Women in Italian Cinema and Media,” Flavia Laviosa brings together several aspects—legal, political, cultural, sociological and psychological—of sexual violence against women in Italy, thus examining the phenomenon across disciplines and through a cultural studies approach that aims at re-creating the psychology of the victims of sexual violence within the framework of trauma theory. The novelty of this chapter consists in addressing this aberrant behavior from multiple perspectives and manifestations. First, the author gives a historical overview of the international and Italian feminist debate on the definitions and forms of sexual violence; second, she analyzes how gang-rape has been represented in Italian cinema, performed in theater, and covered by the media; and third, she discusses how Italian institutions, the legal system, and women’s organizations have dealt with such behavior, while exposing the widespread cultural acceptance and the legal tolerance towards this crime. The texts examined are four feature films: two versions of Two Women (La ciociara, Vittorio De Sica, 1960 and Dino Risi, 1989), The Most Beautiful Wife (La sposa più bella Damiano Damiani, 1970), The Pack (Il Branco, Marco Risi, 1994) and The Wedding Dress (Il vestito da sposa, Fiorella Infascelli, 2003); a theater play The Rape (Lo stupro, Franca Rame, 1975); media coverage of The Circeo Massacre (1975) and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\na documentary of an actual rape trial, Trial for Rape (Processo per stupro, Loredana Dordi, 1979).\n\n1\n\nNOTES\n\nOn cultural studies theory for Gramsci Culture see Ideology and Social Process, Tony Bennett, Colin Mercer and Janet Woolacott, eds.

It was ushered in by Hercules (Le fatiche di Ercole, Pietro Francisci, 1957) and consisted largely of tales based loosely on Greco-Roman mythology with heroes played by body-builders (usually American) such as Steve Reeves. The subgenre also encompasses ﬁlms that were loosely based on history, e.g., The Giant of Marathon (La battaglia di Maratona, Jacques Tourneur and Mario Bava, 1959), and on biblical subjects, e.g., Samson (Sansone, Gianfranco Parolini, 1962). The peplum spawned at least 200 movies over a seven-year period and derived its name from French critics, in reference to the type of tunic often worn by its characters, at least in the pseudo-mythological and pseudo-historical ﬁlms. The ﬁlone has not attracted much critical attention. This is largely because of its absurdity (or what I would rather term “absurdism”). Featuring cartoon-like characters and situations in live-action cinema, ridiculous monsters and sci-ﬁ eﬀects, and musclemen wielding boulders of\n\n18\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\npapier mâché, the peplum appears at ﬁrst glance to be nothing more than a box-oﬃce ploy in spectacular bad taste. Moreover, it seems a sadly escapist moment in Italian ﬁlm, particularly after the renowned seriousness of neorealism and when compared with the Italian “art” cinema of Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, and others. However, as with even the most frivolously intentioned of popular culture phenomena, the peplum does meaningful cultural work, reﬂecting and embodying signiﬁcant economic, social, and ideological realities as an integral part of precisely that which it seems to be ﬂeeing. I would like here to address that work. In particular, by expanding my chronological parameters to include three pre-pepla sword-and-sandal ﬁlms—Fabiola (Fabiola, Alessandro Blasetti, 1949), Sins of Rome (Spartaco, Riccardo Freda, 1952), and Ulysses (Ulysses, Mario Camerini, 1954)—as well addressing three bona ﬁde pepla—Hercules, The Colossus of Rhodes (Il Colosso di Rodi, Sergio Leone, 1961), and Hercules and the Captive Women (Erocle alla conquista d’Atlantide, Vittorio Cottafavi, 1961)—I would like to chart a trajectory of signiﬁcant changes within the Italian situation, reading the ﬁlms in relation to history and vice versa. As the ﬁlms move from stories of compromised or failed revolution (Fabiola, Sins of Rome) to tales of (monarchical) restoration (Ulysses, Hercules), they reﬂect the increasing conservatism of the postwar period: the disappearance of Resistance aspirations and values and the onset of 1950s conformism. The common people, central to Fabiola and Sins of Rome, disappear as the succeeding two ﬁlms escape into a classical world that, particularly in the case of the peplum, seems far distant not only from the realist settings of neorealism but also from the ﬁctionalized-history-with-contemporary-relevance that characterizes the ﬁrst two. On the other hand, and consistent with the normal evolution of genres, the peplum acquires a certain degree of selfreﬂexivity, becoming in certain instances strikingly anti-reactionary. The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women are not just silly, they are seriously silly, parodying their own escapism and allowing for compelling critiques of the extreme limitations posed by the Americanization of politics at the end of and following the Second World War. In so doing, they point to the strong politicization of Italian ﬁlm and society that characterizes the later 1960s. At the same time, the six ﬁlms chart a movement beyond an isolated Italian\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n19\n\ncontext as Italian cinema increasingly negotiates American cultural inﬂuence and a host of American-driven values associated with late capitalism, consumerism, and nascent postmodernity. By Ulysses, the eﬀects of Americanization materialize; by The Colossus of Rhodes so does Italian resistance to those eﬀects. The ﬁlm with the most overt links (albeit allegorical) to a social and political reality is Alessandro Blasetti’s Fabiola. The biggest box oﬃce success in Italy following its release, Fabiola was very loosely based on a nineteenth-century novel, Fabiola o La Chiesa delle catacombe by English Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, and details Christian revolution on historical, political, religious, and personal levels, all four of which dovetail by the ﬁlm’s end. The story situates itself historically at the moment when Constantine, experiencing a vision before his triumph over Massenzio at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, brings religious tolerance to Rome and the Roman Empire, marking in eﬀect the legal and political legitimization of Christianity in Western society. The social backdrop of the ﬁlm is a Christian “revolution,” with converts multiplying daily and forever changing the fabric of the Roman Empire. The spiritual odyssey of the protagonists, Rhual and Fabiola, draws them ever closer to the revolution, as they evolve in selﬂessness and transcendent love to the point of their own conversion in the arena. Fabiola’s conversion then has a culminative, centrifugal eﬀect. The moment she closes her eyes and makes the sign of the cross, accepting Christianity, the social transformation In Fabiola (1949), the title character (Michèle Morgan) closes her eyes and makes the sign of the cross at the moment of her conversion.\n\n20\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nthat has been occurring around her completes itself. First, gladiators who were about to kill Rhual throw down their swords. Then the throngs in the arena unite in clamorous conﬁrmation of her (and their) newfound Christianity. Moreover, when Fabiola conﬁrms her faith in a Christian hereafter by willing her own death (she tells a soldier under orders of the anti-Christian Roman prefect to kill her and Rhual), the legions of Constantine suddenly appear. Fabiola’s death is averted, and the ﬁlm concludes with the image of Constantine’s insignia which recalls his vision and his motto in hoc signo vinces (“in this sign you will conquer”). The progression of events at the end lead to the implication that Constantine represents God’s arrival on the scene or, more theologically, the fulﬁllment of His presence in the world, actuated by the virtuous actions of the ﬁlm’s hero and heroine and of their ever-growing ranks of Christian compatriots. The ﬁlm is clearly couched in Catholic terms and notions, consistent with the fact that it was produced by the Catholic production company Universalia with funding by the Vatican. However, its revolutionary thrust and representation of a mass social movement do not accord with any contemporary (1940s) religious movement, but with a signiﬁcant discourse of revolution and radical change associated with communism and emerging out of the partisan movement. This discourse was particularly prominent in the ambit of Italian cinema and, in particular, in discussions around neorealism on the part of left-wing ﬁlm critics. There was talk of a new society about to be born from the newly strengthened left as a result of its heroic role in the resistance, and the immediate postwar period was invoked as the “springtime” of a new Italy (Overbey, passim). Consistent with this, and based in part on Blasetti’s own comments about the ﬁlm, both Gian Piero Brunetta and Maria Wyke see the ﬁlm as an allegory less of Christian values than of communist sympathy. Brunetta states that “the ideological preoccupation” is to “make the situation of early Christians emotionally equatable to that of presentday communism” (454, trans. mine), and Wyke asserts that “through the narration of ancient religious persecution, (Fabiola) addresses not only the wartime violence inﬂicted on victims of and rebels against Nazism, but also the post-war intolerance exhibited toward Italian communism” (55). In fact, the scenes of Christian persecution\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n21\n\ntrigger associations with Fascist squadristi attacks against Socialists and Nazi massacres of partisans (as well of course as Nazi persecution of the Jews) and, in this respect, are intended to be multiply evocative and applicable to a persecuted left as well as to fourth-century Christian martyrs. (The ﬁlm’s self-dedication—“to the wronged, the persecuted, and the victims of injustice”—conveys this sense of multiple applicability.) The scenes of secret meeting places and growing solidarity in the face of oppression also recall the clandestine evolution of the Resistance. In this respect, the ﬁlm represents a plea for tolerance in response to the powerful backlash experienced by the left after its initial moment of strength in the postwar. The backlash was fuelled in part by the conservative interests of the Italian employer classes, aided (paradoxically given the ﬁlm’s origins) by the Catholic Church, and supported by the political and economic interference of a hysterically anti-communist American government. It led to the expulsion of the left from the Italian government in 1947 and its disastrous defeat at the hands of the Vatican- and U.S.-supported Christian Democrats in the elections of 1948. The backlash reﬂected strong polarization which, along with massive social unrest, created, at the time of the making of Fabiola, one of the many moments in Italian history in which the country seemed headed toward civil war (Ginsborg: 110). So in certain ways, Fabiola was intended as a progressive ﬁlm, whose message seemed to be that there was nothing to fear in dramatic social change; that in fact communist and Christian social aims were largely equatable; and that acceptance, tolerance, and mutual cohabitation were inﬁnitely preferable to hostility, disunity, and violence. This message reﬂected the moments of social uniﬁcation (ﬂeeting though they proved) that marked the Italian experience toward the end of the war, when the Resistance (largely through the Committees of National Liberation) brought together people from across the political spectrum to aid in the ﬁght for freedom. It also reﬂected broad-spectrum participation in the politics of the immediate postwar, perhaps best reﬂected in the drafting and approval of Italy’s constitution. The extent to which the ﬁlm sought to resonate beyond a purely Christian or Catholic context was consistent with the fact that Universalia, while funded by the Vatican and largely\n\n22\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nviewed as a Catholic production company, was small “c” catholic in the ﬁlms it produced and in its support for ﬁlmmakers of varying political aﬃliations—so much so that ﬁlm and cultural studies scholar Enrica Capussotti actually describes Universalia as “tied to the left.”1 However, as my summary of the ﬁlm’s plot should have made clear, “revolution” or massive social change is ideologically managed in such a way as to ultimately deny communist-style revolution or even radical reform. Any change that occurs is top down. Not only is Constantine the deus-ex-machina who secures the “revolution” at the end (reconﬁrming monarchy despite the referendum of 1946 that had secured republicanism for Italy), but Fabiola herself is a noblewoman who is heavily dependent throughout the ﬁlm on the memory and inﬂuence of her wealthy and inﬂuential father who was killed at the hands of conniving anti-Christian and anti-Constantine politicians. And of course, the ultimate top down change agent is God Himself, working through the divine providence that, by ﬁlm’s end, seems to have been behind every seemingly chance meeting and unrelated event that preceded and coalesced into such a glorious conclusion. This is conﬁrmed by much of the iconography of the ﬁlm, in particular the evocation of in hoc signo vinces, which ultimately eﬀaces any contemporary communist-centered allegory in favor of a traditional Christian reading of pilgrims in progress and God’s grace acting upon them. Concomitantly, the social hierarchy remains largely as it was at the end. The ruling classes are still in charge. The under classes are no longer persecuted, and we are led to believe that slavery will end. However, there is no signiﬁcant equalization or redistribution of wealth or power. Given its equation of Christian and socialist/communist experience, we might conclude that, just as the ﬁlm seeks to render social transformation unthreatening to conservative social forces, it seeks to make social continuity, and in particular stratiﬁcation, unthreatening to the left. Monarchy can be revolutionary and the ruling classes can undergo a transformation of consciousness. However, read in the light of subsequent history, the ﬁlm fails in its attempts at depicting a version of the “umbrella” harmony to which the Resistance had brieﬂy given rise. At worst, it seems, in\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n23\n\nretrospect, a celebration of Italian Christian Democrat values: the restoration of pre-war privilege dressed up as democratic freedom and as the never-to-be-fulﬁlled promise of social reform. Nonetheless Fabiola stands apart from all the other ﬁlms I will be addressing in this essay in articulating, even in the most compromised of ways, the possibility of a mass social movement. The second ﬁlm under consideration is Riccardo Freda’s Sins of Rome, released in 1952. Whereas Fabiola was born out of the experience of the Resistance and immediate postwar period, Sins of Rome emerges from a period in which the left has long been excluded from power and the Christian Democrats have begun to establish a hegemony that will last nearly 50 years. Neorealism has lost its impetus, partly through strategies of ﬁscal and ideological suppression on the part of the government. Italy has entered into a period of conformism so hauntingly portrayed in Frederico Fellini’s I Vitelloni (1953) and is moving rapidly toward the Economic Miracle or “Boom” (1958–63) that will signify the triumph of American capitalism over anything even remotely radical, as the principal means of social integration. Despite this, the story of Sins of Rome is rooted in an actual revolutionary moment in Roman history (which serves as a source for American adaptations that culminate in Stanley Kubrick’s Spartacus, 1960) and was signiﬁcantly resurrected from an 1874 Italian novel by Raﬀaello Giovagnoli. Centering on a slave rebellion, it seemed to oﬀer, at the outset of the 1950s, the possibility of envisioning a return to the heady notions of postwar social change. This seemed even more the case when the prison notebooks of the extraordinary Communist thinker Antonio Gramsci were published between 1948 and 1951 and took the novel as an example of the potential for a national popular literature. In fact, inﬂuenced by Gramsci’s response to the novel, the Italian Communist Party magazine Vie Nuove serialized it during the ﬁrst half of 1952. (See Wyke: 34 ﬀ.) At ﬁrst glance, the ﬁlm seems to support communist investment in the novel and its hero. Rome and the Romans are presented as Fascistic. The growing community of Spartaco’s rebels, gathering in the countryside, clearly evoke the Italian resistance ﬁghters who helped liberate Italy at the end of the Second World War. And Spartaco himself, as Wyke puts it, “is reconfigured … in the mold of an\n\n24\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nItalian partisan ﬁghting in the resistance movement …” (53). However, unlike the partisan movement, Spartaco’s rebellion ends not only in failure but devastation. Moreover, the ﬁlm dramatically deheroizes the protagonist, focusing on his “temptations … self-doubt, and … failing” (Wyke: 55). In fact, Spartaco, having founded the revolutionary movement, ends up betraying it. He leaves his followers, and his love Amitys, to go on a reconnaissance mission that ends up with him in the arms of the noblewoman Sabina, daughter of his Roman enemy Crassus,2 which allows Spartaco’s subordinate Octavio to foment dissatisfaction among the slaves. Shortly after returning to the rebels, Spartaco is again lured to the world of Sabina and Crassus by the Sabina’s claim that the Crassus wants to make a deal. While Spartaco wastes time haggling with Crassus (who makes clear that Sabina made up the deal-making ploy and that he himself is not really interested), Octavio and Amitys incite the slaves into a suicidal mission against the Romans, and by the time Spartaco makes ready to return, a massacre is in progress that decimates his troops and ends the rebellion. As he tells Amitys, who ﬁnds him dying on the ﬁeld of battle: “It’s too late. I betrayed you all … I made promises I didn’t keep. I led you to disaster not to victory. This is the end of our road. All is lost.” There is more than a bit of irony in Spartaco’s egoism: he did not lead his people to anything; he was just not around. The consequences of his actions are underscored in a long and haunting aerial shot and pan, including two dissolves to heighten the sense of time and space, as Amitys walks through a seemingly endless battleﬁeld of dead bodies in search of Spartaco. Although there are obviously Roman dead as well, the overwhelming sensation is of the annihilation of the rebel movement. Freda’s representation of the revolutionaries is damning. Not only is their leader easily seduced by the pleasures associated with established power, but the leadership of the slaves is riven by conﬂict (Octavio vs. Spartaco) virtually the moment the rebellion is born.3 The rest of the slaves are sheep, easily led in one or direction or another, depending on who dictates orders. Analogies with both Soviet and Italian communism are, of course, not diﬃcult to ﬁnd (For the latter, see Wyke: 56). The ﬁlm oﬀers an ironically happy ending. Amitys claims: “Even\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n25\n\nif this battle is lost, the ﬁght will go on until victory is ours. Be at peace, your example will be followed. The ﬂame you’ve lit is still burning. It will burn until the world is free.” However, it is obvious that Spartaco’s example has been appalling and that there are no followers in sight to continue the ﬁght. The concluding “optimism” seems to be Freda miming and in fact parodying the end of Fabiola. Amitys becomes a (purely simulated) transformative heroine. And the ﬁnal shot echoes Fabiola’s concluding image of Constantine’s ﬂag and insignia, by turning Amitys into an icon, holding aloft Spartaco’s sword in the promise of some future liberation. (In hoc signo vinces.) This silly ending belies all the more interesting events and implications that have preceded it, and its absurdity may well have been Freda’s revenge for all the interference he experienced in making the ﬁlm, particularly as he sought to create an even darker vision than that which ultimately reached the screen (Faldini e Foﬁ: 358). Nonetheless, the underlying darkness does survive, and the impossibility of meaningful social change in the ﬁlm seems to reﬂect not only problems within the Italian left and communism in general, but the larger stasis that had already begun to characterize Italian politics and society by 1952. Having moved from successful revolution—albeit Christianized, monarchized, dematerialized, and deprived of genuine social transformation—in Fabiola to a failed and quite hopeless revolution in Sins of Rome, we move to an even more conservative political model—restoration—in Mario Camerini’s Ulysses. Both as a story of restoration and as the only Italian sword-and-sandal ﬁlm of note between Sins of Rome and Hercules, Ulysses serves as a major harbinger of the peplum. It also seems to presage the ﬁlone as a turn to the classics or high art and away from anything remotely linked to a national popular, though the peplum’s use of the classics will have a distinctively popular culture orientation. Ulysses does, though, presage the peplum’s escape into a kind of past that is unusable as potential allegory for a revolutionary present or future (in contrast to the historical precedents reworked by Fabiola and Sins of Rome). The story is, of course, grounded in Homer’s Odyssey. Its status as a classic sets it largely apart from the other ﬁlms under consideration, and for that reason, I deal with it more brieﬂy than with the others.\n\n26\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nDespite its remoteness in time and space, the story resonates quite nicely with numerous aspects of Italy’s wartime experience, depicting an island (read peninsular) society occupied by strangers (the suitors),4 in a virtual state of civil war, suﬀering from a lack of leadership and a consequent void in political authority, and, of course, in desperate need of liberation. Moreover, both The Odyssey and Ulysses foreground the problem of postwar readjustment, of a soldier and his family having to address the former’s return to a domestic peacetime environment.5 This latter aspect makes Ulysses seem less a political than a more broadly human or personal document: more the return of an individual to his rightful place than the restoration of a king to his rightful throne. Ulysses’ ability to serve as a kind of “everyman” is reﬂected in his playing the beggar upon his return, and remaining undetected as long as he wishes. Nonetheless, it is made clear that the “democratizing” of Ithaca in terms of meritocratic competition among the suitors for the hand of Penelope is an evil that must be remedied through a return to the old monarchy and Ulysses, the once and future king. Moreover, in strong contrast with both Fabiola and Sins of Rome, there is virtually no representation of the common people. The fact that Ulysses impersonates one only to achieve his royal aims underscores their eﬀacement. Put another way, Ulysses’ commonness, present not just in his disguise but in his representation throughout the ﬁlm as a kind of “all-American Joe”—aﬀable, adventurous, one-of-the-guys, heroicbut-greatly-ﬂawed—constitutes a kind of strategic ideological contradiction, recalling the kind of impossible conﬂation of communism and Catholicism at work in Fabiola, rearticulating monarchy in the language of commonality rather than imperious royalty to satisfy the democratic tastes of newly republican Italy while still retaining the bases of conservative political authority. Whereas Ulysses’ focus on monarchy and restoration might be explained away as the result of the story’s ancient origins, Hercules establishes the theme of restoration as fundamental to the Italian sword-and-sandal ﬁlm of the later 1950s and beyond. This ﬁrst true peplum, Hercules (Le fatiche di Ercole, 1958), along with its successor Hercules Unchained (Ercole e la regina di Lidia, Pietro Francisci,\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n27\n\n1959) furnishes the template for future pepla, especially those with Hercules as protagonist, and the almost inevitable plot is the enlistment of Hercules to restore a rightful ruler or his or her rightful heirs to a throne. When the peplum moves from Hercules to other musclemen heroes and even when the template begins to dissolve as the ﬁlone veers into weirdly distorted variants, the vast majority of stories have to do with the restoration of (the old) order following some crisis (normally political or manmade, but occasionally the result of marauding monsters). The ideological work of the peplum then can be summarized as rendering the perpetuation of traditional power relations through some correction to a parenthetical (to use Croce’s noted term for Fascism) interruption to a normal political situation. With Hercules, the common people, central to Fabiola and Sins of Rome, and at least metonymically important through Ulysses-as-beggar in Ulysses, are absent as a narrative force. Worse still in Hercules, the one notable common man in the ﬁlm is pure evil: i.e., the assassin hired by the usurper of the throne and present throughout as a dark and menacing force. How far removed we are not only from the ﬁrst two pepla I have discussed, but also from man-in-the street neorealism. The gravitation of the 1950s Italian sword-and-sandal ﬁlm toward stories of restoration and privilege seems much less than incidental in the context of a nation whose sociopolitical motto has been “Things must change so they can remain the same,” a slight paraphrase of Prince Don Fabrizio Salina’s endlessly cited comment in both Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel (which appeared a year after Hercules) and Luchini Visconti’s ﬁlm adaptation The Leopard (Il gattopardo, 1963). Italy has been marked by the stubborn reproduction of existing power relations even when change has seemed necessary or even inevitable. The dominant political strategy since the Risorgimento (more precisely since 1882 and Agostino Depretis, the head of government at the time) has been trasformismo: the reformulation of the status quo and the avoidance of any threat to the existing government via deal-making with the opposition: bringing them into the government, “bribing” them through support on certain issues, and so on. The results of trasformismo are seen in the eternal return of individuals and parties to power. DePretis presided over eight\n\n28\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\ngovernments during a span of 11 years. Giovanni Giolitti was prime minister ﬁve times over 29 years (1892–1921). In the postwar and despite the transformation from monarchy to republic and the seeming opportunity for political alternation oﬀered by full-scale democracy, things got arguably worse. Alcide De Gasperi not only served as last head of government under the monarchy and ﬁrst of the new republic, he headed up eight governments before leaving power in 1953, while his party, the Christian Democrats, remained dominant from the mid-1940s until 1992. To a large extent, the Christian Democrats represented the re-enfranchisement of pre-war Italian interests and hierarchies particularly in terms of big money and the Church. Pre-war Italy also survived through the socalled “continuity of the state”: the legitimization of the king and the existing government in the south of Italy, following the fall of Fascism, which led to “the conservation of state institutions and central bureaucracy which was to prove so fundamental a stumbling-block to any serious reform in postwar Italy” (Ginsborg: 48). Even Fascism was, in a sense, “restored” following the end of the Second World War and despite the partisan movement. Notwithstanding a brief initiative of epurazione or purging, both the structures and functionaries of Fascism remained largely in place during the period of Reconstruction, and as early as June 1946, epurazione was eﬀectively ended, signifying not only a continuation of Fascist presence but, in eﬀect, its subtle reestablishment as an acceptable underlying reality of Italian life.6 (Neo)Fascism even re-emerges as a permanent political force as early as 1953 (Ginsborg: 143). By the time the peplum emerged, Italy was well settled into political inertia. The Christian Democrats had already been in power for nearly ten years. Amintore Fanfani would return to power ﬁve times and head eight governments, embracing 23 years. Giulio Andreotti would be prime minister three times, comprising seven governments and 20 years. This not only belies the notion of Italy as a profoundly unstable democracy, it points to the fact that Italy’s unique combination of change (repeatedly reformulated governments) and stasis (always the same ruling party) meant that virtually every new election was, in fact, a “restoration.” One of the principal forces that enabled the Christian Democrats\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n29\n\nto embark on their long career of self-perpetuation was the United States, rabid in its anti-communism and fear of political and social transformation. Following upon its role in the liberation of Italy, the United States became an ever more powerful economic and cultural force on the peninsula via its Marshall Plan; its meddling in Italian postwar politics; its model of social integration via consumer capitalism; and its transformation of 1950s Rome, as the headquarters of Italian cinema, into “Hollywood on the Tiber” (the apt phrase of the U.S. entertainment press of the time). The Italian sword-and-sandal ﬁlms strongly reﬂect this powerful American presence. Ulysses was produced not only by Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis but by William W. Schorr. Three prominent American screen writers, Hugh Gray, Ben Hecht, and Irwin Shaw, were involved in the script. And most visibly, the man who brings Ulysses back not only to Ithaca but to 1950s Italian audiences is Kirk Douglas. The peplum proper is even more alla Americana, becoming largely synonymous with the physique of Steve Reeves and owing its success largely and perhaps principally to export to the United States. After Hercules enjoyed a signiﬁcant return on its modest production costs in Italy, the American distributor Joseph E. Levine picked up the rights for next to nothing, mass advertised the ﬁlm on television, and turned it into a top ten box oﬃce success in the United States. He did much the same with Hercules Unchained, which also became the largest grossing ﬁlm in England in 1960. This created the market that made it possible and proﬁtable for the Italian ﬁlm industry to turn out a seemingly endless supply of spin-oﬀs. Because it stars not just an American but a bodybuilder (Mr. America, Mr. World, and Mr. Universe), Hercules introduces into the sword-and-sandal ﬁlm the built vs. the natural body: i.e., the “escalation” of the body through a kind of military discipline into a virtual weapon.7 The clear message “size does matter” also implies that might is right. Hercules also introduces the hero as perennial outsider,8 suggesting that political problems cannot be resolved through mechanisms internal to a society, but only through the importation of power from without. If we correlate the escalating American body as imported muscle with the role of the U.S. in Europe during the two world wars, and\n\n30\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nparticularly with its role during the postwar and the Cold War in Italy and in NATO, the peplum, despite its seemingly resounding escapism, becomes uncannily allegorical of the very reality that it seems bent on denying. In most cases, the allegory is unintentional: the result of ﬁctional narrative paralleling history because it is part of that history. However, in what I will term the “subversive” pepla, The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women, the linkage of peplum hero and American intervention allows for a highly productive reading of the ﬁlone and of the politics of the time. The focus on the male body as spectacle in Hercules and the peplum has, obviously, a far more local referent than American interventionist power. As Richard Dyer has demonstrated convincingly (169-76), the peplum recuperates much of the imagery of Fascism (another example of “restoration”). And its fundamentally authoritarian vision, evident both in political structure and Fascist iconography, is expanded to include a religious realm that is arbitrary and intractable. At times the gods exert near total control over the characters in a manner that deﬁes comprehension or resistance. Read as a model of religious authoritarianism, Hercules (and the pepla in general) accords with a still deeply Catholic Italy, but also with an America whose 1950s conservatism included a high degree of religious conformity, reﬂected in the Hollywood Biblical sword and sandals such as The Ten Commandments (Cecil B. DeMille, 1956) and Ben-Hur (William Wyler, 1959). Yet Hercules is perhaps most signiﬁcant as a sign of its time in its embodiment of the early signs of postmodernism, or, as Fredric Jameson’s terms it, “the cultural logic of late capitalism.” In seeming contradistinction to its emphasis on restrictive social structure, Hercules promotes individualism and self-gratiﬁcation in its celebration of the body, sexuality, desire, and spectacle.9 Though gratiﬁcation is to some extent disciplined here and in the peplum in general by its association with deviance (the Amazon women here, any number of other similar—and often female—social threats in other pepla), market appeal easily trumps discipline, as the ﬁlms’ principal attraction is their sexiness (comic absurdity running not too far behind). This contests the values of traditional Catholic Italian culture as well as Puritan/Presbyterian Anglo-American culture.10 In terms of Hercules’ Italian context, the juxtaposition of authoritarian\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n31\n\nsocial forms and heightened individualism captures the paradox of the 1950s Christian Democrats in their balancing act between the Church and American materialism: claiming to be the political voice both of Catholicism and modernization. The emphasis on instant gratiﬁcation over coherent and evolving experience begins to evoke the postmodern when accompanied by hyper seriality and substitutability (all the many Hercules, Ursus’s, Macistes, with all the many actor/body builders who played them and all the many love relationships and at times marriages they enjoy) that unsettle stable identity. That unsettling is abetted by an annihilation of origins through the appropriation, disordering, and random reconstruction of the basis of Western culture: the classics. High culture is transmuted into low culture or, perhaps more accurately, all boundaries between the two are dissolved. Through seriality, repetition, and random juxtaposition, conventional Western notions of progress and teleology are thwarted. Parody, kitsch, and camp, abound, and the homoerotics of the scantily clad, aesthetically and physically dominant, male body question traditional modernist Hollywood strategies of gendering of spectatorship and identity.11 The largely American cultural logic of late capitalism is, of course, a double-edged sword (and slippery sandal). The assault on normativity and authoritarian social structures can be seen as liberating, subversive, progressive. However, the destabilizing of social and political identiﬁes can also be seen as radically atomizing and disempowering, turning (American) democracy into a plurality of unhinged hedonists or, worse still, sociopaths—which is what our last two pepla, The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women, in opening the largely conservative peplum out to parody and satire, seem to imply. The comic book seriality and spec(tac)ularity of the peplum are linked to its perceived audience and marketing. Within Italy, the peplum was directed to a poor and often illiterate audience, often with rural viewing experiences of the “strongman” à la Zampanò in Federico Fellini’s La Strada. In the United States the peplum was marketed to a growing mass audience that thrived on schlock double-bills, the drive-in, and, ultimately, television. The ﬁlone’s utter irreverence toward high culture and toward an education system that\n\n32\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nSteve Reeves’ built male body challenges norms around sexual representation and orientation in the 1950s in the title role of Hercules (1959).\n\nstill promoted high culture, as well as its ability to be read as selfparody, made it ideal fodder for the adolescent mentality of an emergent youth culture. (It was certainly entertaining fodder for me as a 15-year-old growing up in New York City and heading oﬀ to cheapo double features every weekend.) As much of the above would suggest, Hercules, in all its widescreen packaging (it is the ﬁrst widescreen ﬁlm in my “trajectory”), its action-adventure (non)narrative, its commitment to the body and senses over the mind, and its resounding renunciation of “seriousness,” is pure product. It speaks, as its reception in the Anglo-American world made clear, to American consumerism, which is in high gear by the later 1950s. It also helps mark the arrival of the Italian Economic Miracle—the meteoric rise in living standards, Americanstyle capitalism, and individualism—that transpired in Italy through the late 1950s and into the early 1960s. To the extent that the Economic Miracle is equivalent to Americanization, Hercules becomes much less a story of restoration than of profound subversion, signaling the overthrow of traditional Italian values in the face of the “American Italian revolution” long prepared for by American interventionism during and after the Second World War. There is also something subversive in Hercules’ participation in the birth of a youth consumer culture that brings with it powerful deconstructive tendencies. In fact, the insistent mockery with which it treats everything it represents, from classic literature to heroism to happy heterosexual endings, makes it diﬃcult to take its conservative politics very seriously. In fact, it seems to herald the “irreverent\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n33\n\nanti-authoritarianism” that Ginsborg saw as characteristic of the Italian student movement of the later 1960s (304), but that also serves as an apt description of much oppositional 1960s Western culture. Having witnessed the disappearance of potential political transformation or revolution—and with it any meaningful representation of “the people”—as we move from the early Italian postwar sword-andsandal ﬁlm to the peplum and from postwar ferment to the conservatism of the 1950s, we now move to the 1960s and the emergence of self-reﬂexivity in the peplum. The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women, seem to avail themselves of the subversive energy potential within the absurdities and contradictions of Hercules and turn it into sustained parody or “irreverent anti-authoritarianism” on the level both of genre and of politics. While part of this involves a dismantling of alternative social formations à la Sins of Rome, these ﬁlms are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from their predecessor. Sins of Rome’s vision of the impossibility of revolution and the fallibility of revolutionaries was quite circumscribed in mirroring the exhaustion of Italian postwar aspirations for social, and more precisely socialist, transformation. The Colossus of Rhodes and Hercules and the Captive Women, inscribe themselves on a much larger canvas, reﬂecting the internationalism of their historical moment and of the issues they implicitly invoke. The former, directed by Sergio Leone,12 was conceived as parody even before the lead actor Rory Calhoun arrived on the set, mistakenly embraced a number of men thinking they were Leone, and fell into a swimming pool before the astonished eyes of the director (Frayling: 102). As one might deduce from Calhoun’s social and physical ineptness, much of the ﬁlm’s parody targets the notion of the hero. For one thing, Calhoun/Dario has a supercilious smirk on his face most of the time. For another, Leone dresses him in costumes that seem at times a mix of classic tunic and women’s summer outﬁts of the early 1960s. (Though we may initially fail to realize the absurdity of the costumes, accepting them as historical, a close look reveals them to be, instead, laugh-out-loud ridiculous.) On the level of character, Dario, virtually duplicates the moral weakness of Spartaco, bringing about a massacre of rebels and the arrest of their leaders by leaving their camp to visit a woman of the\n\n34\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nRory Calhoun, as Dario, is dressed in a girlish-looking tunic in The Co-\n\nlossus of Rhodes (1961).\n\nruling class, Diala. Worse even than Spartaco, he tells Diala where the rebels are hiding, oblivious to the fact that she is intimately involved in all the evildoings on Rhodes. He thinks he is acting in the best interests of Rhodes and of the rebels in visiting Diala, but he is utterly clued out. Dario is also the virtual antithesis of the do-all peplum hero à la Hercules. Unlike the latter, who can move or hurl any object, no matter its size or weight, Dario cannot even budge a piece of the Colossus’ mechanism that falls on Diala at the ﬁlm’s end. In fact, he barely even tries. Certainly not a strongman, he is a failed hero in many other respects. At the very beginning, he gets trapped in a labyrinth by Diala, who clearly has more smarts than he. He gets knocked out after about two seconds of ﬁghting with the rebel leader, Peliocles. He has to be freed by the rebels after he has been arrested by the leaders of Rhodes for trying to escape in one of their boats. (At least here he participates with vigor in the ﬁghting, but the scene occurs less than midway through the ﬁlm, and he does nothing to match it for the remainder.) When the rebel leaders have been tossed into the arena, thanks to Dario’s indiscretions with Diala, they free themselves, while Dario looks on from the sidelines. (His only signiﬁcant activity is to disable one charioteer and make a speech to the crowd about the dangers facing Rhodes.) It is thus quite ironic when, after the arena battle, Peliocles says to Dario: “You’ve done more than\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n35\n\nyour share, Dario. Now you’d better think of safety.” The parody gets even stronger when Dario spends the entire rebellion locked up in the Colossus and then has to be spared and untied by Diala. Immediately thereafter, as the earthquake begins, he runs to the back of the room, covering himself rather than helping Diala—failing her on grounds of both chivalry and (since she has just decided to save his life) gratitude. He does not confront or kill Thar, the evil leader of Rhodes, Peliocles’ brother Creonte does. Described in this manner, Dario’s failings as a hero seem patent. However, Leone’s portrayal (like the costuming) is subtle and not particularly noticeable upon a ﬁrst viewing of the ﬁlm,13 and it is here that much of the brilliance of the ﬁlm’s parody lies. Leone puts his “hero” in heroic situations, gives him heroic poses, and has him treated as a hero (“You’ve done more than your share Dario”) so that we assume he is the hero unless we scrutinize the nature of his (in)activity. (The arena sequence and its aftermath, where Dario’s “heroism” consists almost entirely of his words and those of Peliocles, is an excellent example.) In so doing, Leone not only parodies the typical action hero, he critiques audience expectations based on genre, on notions of the “great individual,” and on classic Hollywood ﬁlm. In fact, Leone admitted to using Alfred Hitchcock’s North By Northwest (1959) as his inspiration for much of The Colossus of Rhodes. He reproduces surface similarities, making Dario’s character resemble that of Hitchcock’s Roger Thornhill: “a spoiled child, a little tired of it all, who ﬁnds himself involved in a series of events he doesn’t understand, and has to spend all his time looking for ways to escape from everyone” (Leone quoted in Frayling: 99). More important, he captures the self-reﬂexive spirit of Hitchcock’s movie. North By Northwest portrays the creation of a Cold War hero by the CIA, which effectively casts the weak-kneed mama’s boy Thornhill in the role of a non-existent “George Kaplan,” who by ﬁlm’s end is performing feats that Thornhill never could have. Hitchcock’s ﬁlm is not only about the construction of American heroes (and thus the lack of American identity), in relation to external crises (manufactured or otherwise), it is also, like The Colossus of Rhodes, about the movie hero and levels of audience gullibility in relation to it. Hitchcock pushes his protagonist’s heroics well beyond anything we could imagine either\n\n36\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nThornhill or Kaplan (or for that matter any Cary Grant protagonist) doing: for example, saving himself and the heroine by holding on to her with one hand while dangling by the other from a cliﬀ on Mount Rushmore, while the latter is being crushed by the foot of a trained killer. Yet the audience is forced by the interpellating power of the Hollywood formula ﬁlm (much as Thornhill is forced by the CIA and the interpellating power of American ideology) to surrender its autonomy and be carried unquestioning to the end. It is precisely this kind of critique that Leone reproduces in his ﬁlm. The Colossus of Rhodes appropriates not just the critique of the hero in North By Northwest but the ﬁlm’s use of cultural iconography, mimicking the Mount Rushmore scenes with those of tiny human ﬁgures scrambling around the surface of the Colossus. The Colossus was meant to suggest not only Mount Rushmore, but an even more fundamental icon of America, the Statue of Liberty. Given the fact that the Colossus is built in Fascist monumental style, the Colossus links Fascism and the United States, and the Statue of Liberty becomes, as Frayling has noted (98) “a symbol of tyranny.” Rather than “welcoming the huddled masses,” the Colossus pours boiling oil upon them twice. It serves not only as a weapon of mass destruction, but also as a prison and a barracks. Perhaps most tellingly in terms of American military technology, nuclear escalation, and postwar interventionism, the Colossus is a site of technological experimentation gone horribly wrong. It has been used, against the wishes of the inventor and scientiﬁc wizard Carete, for world domination. As should be clear from all I have just said, Leone’s ﬁlm is a critique not just of the hero but of the speciﬁcally American hero. Consistent with Hercules before him, Dario comes from outside. Not only is he, yet again, played by an American, but he comes from Athens, a classic symbol of democracy often appropriated by the United States in its endless self-championing as the epitome of democracy: in the wake of Nazism and Fascism, in the rhetoric of the Cold War, and now following 9/11.14 Dario does not want to get involved at the start, reﬂecting a longstanding tradition of American isolationism. He is shallow and naïve, extroverted, friendly, and swashbuckling—a compendium of clichés identiﬁable as “American,” particularly from a European perspective.\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n37\n\nLeone’s Colossus (1961) parodies Hitchcock’s Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, with little creatures battling on the right bicep and shoulder while others crawl out of the right ear.\n\nLeone’s critique of the hero and the need for an outsider to (presumably) clean things up serves as part of a more global critique of political order(s). At ﬁrst The Colossus of Rhodes seems to hearken back to the earlier sword-and-sandal ﬁlms of revolution, in that there is a rebel group seeking to take power and constantly invoking “the people” in their declarations of political and military opposition. However, while those in power are either thoroughly ignorant or thoroughly corrupt, the rebels have their own signiﬁcant limitations. First of all, they are convinced their salvation lies in enlisting the aid of Dario, whose ineptness we have detailed at length. They too, in short, are dependent on authority, which recalls the analysis of the rebels in Sins of Rome. And though they enjoy some minor victories (enough to demonstrate both their marked superiority to Dario and the absurdity of their reliance on him), they make no real headway against their Rhodian oppressors until the earthquake, which is pure deus ex machina, pure Hollywood/peplum cheap trick. It is the earthquake that destroys the Phoenician ﬂeet, central to the evil plans of the Rhodian leaders. It is the earthquake that sends Thar running out of the Colossus to his death. And it is the earthquake, not any political revolution, that brings about the death of the old order. Leone also gives us more pointed clues as to the rebels’ limits as\n\n38\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nleaders of a popular revolt, though much of this is missing from the choppy conclusion to the recent U.S. DVD release of the ﬁlm. With the earthquake devastating Rhodes, the rebels are happy to ﬁght their enemies but unwilling to stay on and risk their lives to help those caught in the collapsing buildings. There is one exception, Creonte, and only when Dario is summoned by Creonte does he do anything to help. When Creonte is killed by a falling building, the minimal relief work done by the rebels is eﬀectively ended, and Dario and Peliocles seek an escape route from the city. They pause brieﬂy when another collapsing building traps a Rhodian, but they leave him struggling or dead amidst the rubble as soon as another of their group calls out to them. They steal the key to one of the gates of the city from a dead soldier and high-tail it out of Rhodes. The image of Peliocles prying the key loose with a kind of obsessed fury is given prominence and resonates with a number of other images of people plundering or hoarding goods amidst the earthquake. Tellingly, the ﬁlm cuts back to people still in the city as the rebels leave: a distraught man carrying his dead child, an older child helping a younger child when both get felled by falling beams. Both are images of human solidarity in sharp contrast to the rebels leaving the site of devastation. The earthquake escape sequence conﬁrms what has been suggested throughout the movie: the rebels are an insular group whose sense of solidarity does not extend beyond them or beyond those who, like Dario, are willing to join them. They are deﬁned far more by bellicose homosociality than by any social mission or conscience. The one signiﬁcant female member of the band, Mirte, who is also Dario’s love interest by ﬁlm’s end, is a ﬁgure of continual empathy and grieving, but always and only for her own. Having eﬀectively turned their back on their city, this alternative political bunch will hardly be the architects of a glorious new social reconstruction. It goes pretty much without saying, but the cynicism, apocalypticism, and jaundiced Americanism of The Colossus of Rhodes anticipate in various ways Leone’s spaghetti westerns. The ﬁnal ﬁlm under consideration in this essay, Hercules and the Captive Women, can be read as a companion piece to The Colossus of Rhodes, though it is arguably even more ironic and parodic. Perhaps most notable in the context of this essay’s trajectory, it dismantles the\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n39\n\nkind of restoration drama central to Ulysses and Hercules and places democracy at the center of its political discourse—an interesting challenge given the nature of government in the societies normally represented by the peplum.15 Its director Vittorio Cottafavi, though never to attain the world-class status of Leone, was a highly accomplished director of postwar melodramas who then came to specialize in pepla during their brief moment of dominance. At times he seemed inclined to renounce its trash tendencies by turning it into art. His ﬁnal sword-and-sandal ﬁlm, Son of El Cid (1964; I cento cavalieri), is highly self-reﬂexive not just on the level of genre, but on the level of story-telling itself, featuring a self-ironizing narrator who seems to presage Pier Paolo Pasolini’s examination of art and the artist in his “Trilogy of Life”—The Decameron (Il Decameron, 1971), The Canterbury Tales (I racconti di Canterbury, 1972), and The Arabian Nights (Il ﬁore delle mille e una notte 1973). Son of El Cid obtained signiﬁcant critical success, but was such a failure at the box oﬃce that Cottafavi decided to renounce ﬁlm directing in favor of becoming a television director, a role he carried out with enormous distinction at a time when Italian state television produced many high quality teleﬁlms and mini-series. Among his television productions were celebrated adaptations of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus. Though largely unrecognized in the English-speaking world (where I cento cavalieri was released as Son of El Cid with 40 minutes and all of its complexity edited out), Cottafavi has been the subject of continuing interest in France and in Italy.16 It is therefore not surprising to discover that Hercules and the Captive Women, the ﬁlm that immediately precedes I cento cavalieri in Cottafavi’s ﬂlmography, is readable in ways seldom encouraged by other pepla. The point of departure for Hercules and the Captive Women, like that of The Colossus of Rhodes, is a parody of the hero. The ﬁrst time we see Hercules, he is stuﬃng his face with food and wine and refusing, despite entreaties from his son Hylas and his best friend Androcles, to get involved in a barroom brawl that has broken out around him. Shortly thereafter, aware of a grave threat to the Greek states, Hercules refuses to help Androcles who, as King of Thebes, wishes to discover and destroy the source of the threat. Androcles and Hylas have to drug and kidnap Hercules to get him to come along. Then,\n\n40\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nReg Park’s Hercules is a consumer society layabout instead of an action hero for much of Hercules and the Captive Women (1961).\n\nwhen he awakens at sea, he refuses to do any work, choosing instead to loll, pose, and sunbathe on the ship and on the beach. The hyperactive Hercules of earlier pepla, responsive to even the slightest provocation to adventure, has (with The Colossus of Rhodes as a segue) been transformed into an anti-hero of the Economic Miracle: indolent, vain, ironically detached and apolitical, and intent only on self-gratiﬁcation. He is also the re-domesticated male of the 1950s,17 refusing Androcles’ call to arms because he wants to spend more time with his wife and son. The only time he becomes active is when a situation arises that calls for an immediate heroic response. For example, when Androcles’ crew mutiny and try to steal Androcle’s ship, Hercules single-handedly pulls the entire crew and ship back to shore with a chain. When he comes upon a woman melded to the rocks of the island Atlantis, he frees her by conquering the source of the problem, Proteus. In other words, rather than exercising his powers in support of signiﬁcant moral principles or long-term projects and goals, Hercules acts principally in the moment. And the only reason he gets involved on Atlantis is for purely personal reasons: his best friend Androcles has disappeared. Even when he takes more comprehensive action in response to the evil shenanigans on Atlantis, we can see it more as heroic roleplaying than any more social-minded commitment. In fact, by going oﬀ to destroy the evil stone that transmutes the islanders into clones and slaves, he eﬀectively sacriﬁces the members of the Resistance whom he has just freed from a concentration camp, for left without leadership and organization, they rush to the city and are\n\nTHE ITALIAN SWORD-AND-SANDAL FILM\n\n41\n\nimmediately massacred. In the end, Hercules is a consummate embodiment of la bella ﬁgura and sprezzatura: the desire to look cool and to appear to be making absolutely no eﬀort to accomplish his ends. Not only longstanding traits of Italian masculinity, la bella ﬁgura and sprezzatura are also perfect reﬂections of the new image-conscious male of 1950s capitalism and Italy’s Boom.18 As we look beyond Cottafavi’s critique of the hero to the ﬁlm’s portrayal of politics and society, the latter initially seems rather banal: Queen Antinea, in a quest for world domination, has learned to tamper with nature and clone humans in order to produce a race of identical and seemingly indestructible Aryan warriors. The scene in which these ﬁgures, previously covered from head to toe, take their helmets oﬀ in unison and reveal themselves to be blond-headed, blond-bearded Nazi ideals is visually impressive (as is the attempted killing of Hercules and Hylas in a gas chamber). However, how many post atom-bomb movies had we had by 1961, preaching against playing god with nature and making the bad guys neo-Nazis (read totalitarians or, in many Cold War ﬁlms, communists)? When we consider the fact that the material she has used to perform her “violation of nature” was the stone formed from the blood of Uranus—i.e., uranium—things become a bit more interesting, though not truly compelling. In fact, it seems historically inaccurate to align nuclear destruction with Nazi science. The more closely we look at the ﬁlm, however, the more complex its sociopolitical critique becomes, and much of that critique is directed toward democracy. Although the ﬁlm (like all the pepla) is set in times of monarchy, the ﬁlm labors to introduce democratic mechanisms, such as council meetings, and references to democracy19 to create a seeming contrast between democracy and totalitarianism that dissolves in such a way as to raise the question: does the former really guarantee better results, in humanistic terms, than the latter? The opening sequence seems to present us with a socially ideal, interclassist, situation that quickly and emphatically (though quite comically) disintegrates. We begin in a tavern in which rich and poor, kings and common folk, drink together. (This setting is unique in my experience of pepla.) A woman server moves through\n\n42\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CINEMA\n\nthe two-level space, ﬁlling wine vessels in a joyful dance in which she turns work into pleasure and art.
