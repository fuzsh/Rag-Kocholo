        "text": "EXPLORE NEW CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN CINEMA AND\n\nCLASSIC GEMS AT THE 2021 ST. ALi ITALIAN FILM FESTIVAL\n\nScreening from 20 October, Palace and ST. ALi coffee just announced the full line up for the 2021 ST. ALi Italian Film Festival, celebrating Italian culture, stories and language they are hitting screens around the country just in time to provide a much-needed escape and the chance to become immersed in another world.\n\nThe ST. ALi Italian Film Festival will open with the Australian premiere of Daniele Luchetti’s THE TIES (Lacci) which opened last year’s Venice Film Festival and is a sumptuous marriage in crisis drama spanning several decades.\n\nClosing the 2021 Festival will be the Roberto Rosselini classic ROME, OPEN CITY in a stunning 4K restoration. The film, which was conceived and directed amid the ruin of World War II in Rome, will be part of the Rossellini Retrospective presented by the Italian Cultural Institute Sydney alongside screen gems AMORE, JOURNEY TO ITALY, PAISAN and STROMBOLI. In addition to this retrospective the programme will also feature a celebration of classic Italian screen goddesses Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida and Claudia Cardinale with some of their most loved performances in MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE, BUONA SERA, MRS. CAMPBELL and THE LEOPARD.\n\nThe Centrepiece selection is recent winner of the Director’s Fortnight in Cannes, TO CHIARA (A Chiara). Jonas Carpignano’s searing drama tells the gripping story of a 15-year-old girl from Calabria, whose family life starts to unravel when she discovers her beloved father may have criminal ties.\n\nThis year’s Special Festival Presentation is acclaimed director Nanni Moretti’s (Mia Madre, The Son’s Room) latest film THREE FLOORS (Tre piani). Featuring a tremendous ensemble cast, the film traces the disparate lives of three families who reside in the same apartment block in Rome’s stylish Prati neighbourhood.\n\nFamily films also feature in the programme with GLASS BOY, a heartwarming tale of courage and adventure for all ages about a young boy usually confined to his bedroom setting out to prove he can live like a normal kid, plus WHEN MUM IS AWAY…WITH THE FAMILY (10 giorni con Babbo Natale). A Christmas-themed sequel to the 2019 Festival hit 10 Days Without Mamma, the misadventures of the Rovelli family are back in this entertaining road movie, starring Fabio De Luigi and Valentina Lodovini.\n\nFor kids fifteen years and older is CAM’S WAR a tale of survival and the challenge between Good and Evil which follows a young boy and his sister on a dangerous journey through an apocalyptic world.\n\nCAM’S WAR is also part of The Female Lens sidebar, presented by the Istituto Italiano di Cultura Melbourne, which features contemporary films from female directors. The other is SIRLEY (Maledetta primavera ) from upcoming director Elisa Amoruso and is a highly personal story, based upon her adolescence and a special friendship she forms when she moves to the outskirts of Rome.\n\nOther highlights for the 2021 ST. ALi Italian Film Festival include:\n\nEVERYTHING’S GONNA BE ALRIGHT (Cosa sarà)\n\nA sudden revelation about his state of health leads a man to reevaluate his relationships with his family in this personal story from director Francesco Bruni, starring Kim Rossi Stuart.\n\nHIDDEN AWAY (Volevo nascondermi)\n\nBerlin International Film Festival Silver Bear winner Elio Germano delivers a powerhouse performance in this multi award-winning biopic about the troubled life of celebrated artist Antonio Ligabue.\n\nIF YOU CARE FOR ME (Se mi Vuoi Bene)\n\nA man with a knack for accidentally setting off catastrophes decides to help out the people around him but proceeds to cause them even more trouble in this entertaining comedy about friendship starring Claudio Bisio.\n\nLIKE A CAT ON A HIGHWAY 2 (Come un gatto in tangenziale – Ritorno a Coccia di Morto)\n\nThe sequel to the comedy smash hit Like a Cat on a Highway, Paola Cortellesi and Antonio Albanese return as Monica and Giovanni, whose lives become intertwined again three years later.\n\nPADRENOSTRO (Presented by MIFF)\n\nA 10-year-old boy witnesses an assassination attempt on his father (Pierfrancesco Favino in a Venice Best Actor-winning role) in Claudio Noce’s personal drama, inspired by his own family trauma.\n\nPAOLO CONTE, VIA CON ME\n\nAn enthralling documentary following the life and work of Italian singer and composer Paolo Conte, interwoven with concert footage, interviews, and reflections of the singer by other friends and colleagues such as Roberto Benigni and Isabella Rossellini.\n\nTHE PREDATORS (I predatori)\n\nWinner of Best New Director at the 2021 David di Donatello Awards, Pietro Castellitto’s black comedy takes aim at class antagonism in contemporary Italy when two Italian families on opposite ends of the social ladder collide.\n\nTIGERS (Tigrar)\n\nTigers is the enthralling true story of former Inter Milan player Martin Bengtsson’s rollercoaster ride through the cutthroat world of professional soccer.\n\nTHREE PERFECT DAUGHTERS (È per il tuo bene)\n\nMarco Giallini (Perfect Strangers, God Willing) is back – alongside Vincenzo Salemme and Giuseppe Battiston – with a comedy hit that sees three friends try to hinder the love affairs of their daughters.\n\nYOU CAME BACK (Lasciami andare)\n\nThe Closing Night film of the 2020 Venice International Film Festival, this dramatic thriller set against a backdrop of Venice’s mysterious lagoons stars Stefano Accorsi as a man who finds himself torn between the past and the future.\n\nAnd at selected theatres, FELLINI FORWARD: FROM THE CREATIVE GENIUS OF FEDERICO FELLINI presented by Campari.
