        "text": "Place: New Haven.\n\nScene I: Afternoon.\n\nRoberto Rossellini, the renowned Italian film director who pioneered neo‐realism in the mid‐forties, is teaching a film course at Yale this semester. And so, on a recent Tuesday, there is an air of expectation in the bunkerlike, concrete screening room of the university's art and architecture building. Now that Rossellini's class has viewed his realistic television film “The Rise of Louis XIV,” they are about to come faceto‐face with the filmmaker himself for the first time.\n\nBarely out of their teens, most of the 30‐odd students know Rossellini only by reputation. They are unfamiliar with the body of his film work except for his compassionate, neo‐realistic postWorld War II movies, “Open City” and “Poison,” with their authentic depiction of resistance to Fascism by performers who seemed to be—and sometimes were—taken right off of the streets of Rome. And Yale students are only dimly aware of the public furor that all but wrecked Rossellini's and Ingrid Bergman's careers 24 years ago when, shortly after filming “Stromboli” together, they had a son out of wedlock; or of the subsequent fuss seven years later when, after the filming of “India,” Rossellini and screenwriter Sono Senroy das Gupta had a daughter.\n\n*\n\nIt is just as well that his students haven't stereotyped him, for today, the 67‐year‐old Rossellini is portly and professorial. And, as he patiently explains himself to his class (“I am a worker—not an artist”), he comes across not, of course, as a lover but as a romantic philosopher.\n\nRossellini tells the students that he has become passion. ately interested in developing new cinematic methods for exploring the world around him and for offering some tentative suggestions as to how it got that way. And so he hasn't done a theatrical film since “Anima Nera” and “Illibatezza” in 1962 when he turned to TV as the appropriate medium for the kinds of didactic films he wants to make. At the same time, he claims he has no messages—he's just after the “unvarnished facts.” “The mails are here to carry messages,” he advises the young scholars. “I am not a mailman. To think is job—and yours.”\n\nNot Interested in cinema technique as an end in itself, he does not encourage the students to query his own, explaining merely that his films, like “The Rise of Louis XIV,” are shot with a fixed camera that can pan and zoom and that he has developed a remote device that allows him—not the cameraman—to control the camera zooms during shooting. He says he seldom uses scripts because he considers them uncinematic (“I don't want to illustrate thoughts”) and, to cut costs and raise credibility, he uses unknown actors.\n\nPerhaps because, on this occasion, Rossellini waxes more philosophical than cinematic, and offers himself neither as a charismatic figure nor as a paragon but simply as himself, he doesn't get much feedback from the Yale students—“not even as much,” he observes later, somewhat defensively, “as I got from some high school students in Oakland, California.”\n\n*\n\nPlace: Midtown Manhattan.\n\nScene 2: The following afternoon.\n\nThe contents of Sylvia d'Amico's Louis Vuitton luggage are strewn around Roberto Rossellini's suite at the Algonquin.\n\n“Don't jump to conclusions” cautions the modish, 33‐year‐old Miss d'Amico, who, before she came to work for Rossellini, was Anna Magnani's producer. “I've overflowed my room, which is very small. Would you believe that my role is to put some order in Rossellini's life?”\n\nWith that, she borrows some folding money from the boss, kisses him lightly, checks her tank watch and exits, promising to return in two hours.\n\nRossellini and I clear a place on the couch and begin to discourse. He chain smokes, gesticulates in a rather graceful manner, keeps his usual reserve.\n\nL.K. (skating on the thin edge of good taste): Was the public furor over your affair with Ingrid Bergman harmful to your career? Are you bitter?\n\nR.R.: (forebearingly): I'm not bitter. It was disturbing, of course, but it was also instructive, perhaps—in the long run—even helpful. It forced me to become more rigorous in my work. When you're up against public opinion like that, you either cave in or you do what you have to do and hope that people will come around.\n\nL.K.: Well, people have come around. They're more permissive. As Ingrid Bergman said, “Today, who would care?”\n\nR.R. (primly): Well, I think permissiveness is, wrong. Excess is always wrong.\n\nL.K.: I didn't expect that from you. Perhaps I shouldn't have used the term “permissiveness.” But today the young don't take marriage as seriously as their parents did, while they do seem very serious about the integrity of their relationships.\n\nR.R. (resolutely): Yes, it's very refreshing. I'm not against permissiveness in that respect, but I'm against permissiveness in the sense that I'm against the erotic movies that are being shown on 42d Street—although I must confess that I've never seen one. And I'm against pornography. It's excessive and it's for voyeurs—I'm not a voyeur.\n\nL.K.: Twenty‐fours years ago, New York officials thought that “The Miracle,” your film with Anna Mag. nani, was “sacrilegious” and they banned it for two years —until the Supreme Court overruled them. Now, in its recent pornography decisions, the Court has moved in the opposite direction—extending the right of local communities to ban movies that don't conform to their standards. Do you see a danger in this?\n\nR.R.: Of course, I'm opposed to harassment and censorship. The only way you can fight pornography is with education, by which I mean that if you supply people with enough facts, they themselves will make wise choices. I believe in the essential. goodness of human nature.\n\n*\n\nL.K.:Why have you stopped making theatrical films?\n\nR.R.: I no longer regard entertainment or art as important—which is not to say that I'm against entertainers or artists. I simply want to do . . . for lack of a better term . . . educational films. Why the fuss? It's not such a departure for me. In a sense, even “Open. City” and “Paisan” were educational. They explored the various aspects of World War II, including Fascism and the Resistance, with a view to understanding them.\n\nL.K.: Some critics say that the films you made with Ingrid Bergman in the late forties and early fifties, especially “Stromboli,” “Europa 51” and “Voyage in Italy,” were unpopular when they were released because they were 20 years ahead of their time. Do you agree?\n\nR.R.: (keeping away from a painful subject): I don't want to talk about my theatrical films—I haven't the slightest interest in my past work.\n\nL.K.: Do you have an attitude toward the current work of other filmmakers, say, Bertolucci or Antonioni or Godard?\n\nR.R.: I never go to the movies. If a friend is just starting his career, then I feel obliged to go and see what he's doing, to support him, but once he's launched, what's the point?\n\nL.K.: Is the esthetic for TV different from the esthetic for movies?\n\nR.R.: r think they're the same.\n\nL.K.: Then what attracts you to TV?\n\nR.R.: I'm not attracted to commercial TV which, we all know, exists merely to sell advertising time. At least, public TV professes to serve the public interest. It's more open than the movies to experimentation. And once you've gotten your, financing, part of which Comes from pre‐selling the film to the public network, you're free to do your own thing. You can explore a subject in depth. “Science,” a film I'm working on now, has 12 one‐hour episodes—so far. Can you imagine a 12‐hour movie?\n\nC.K.: Are you still friendly with Ingrid Bergman?\n\nR.R.: Yes, tremendously friendly. After all, we have three children in common—Roberto, 24, and the twins Isabella and Isotta, 21. Bergman's a marvelous person and a very great actress—more controlled than Magnani, but very great all the same. In retrospect, I suppose that our marriage failed because I didn't offer her enough security. I'm a very secure person—but that's a different sort, of security.\n\nL.K.: Were you at Magnani's bedside?\n\nR.R. (his reserve breaking): When I heard that she was ill, I phoned her and offered my help. Suso Cecchi d'Amico—Sylvia's mother—and Sylvia and I were with her until . . . she died.\n\nL.K.: What's your relationship to your five children?\n\nR.R.: Very tight. I'm like the proverbial Jewish mother. Worse: When it comes to my children, I'm like a cow. Renzo, my eldest, is 32. He works with me as a producer. The others—including Raffaella, 16, my youngest—are still in school in Rome.\n\nL.K.: Your films on history and science suggest that you have an encyclopedic knowledge. Did you have a good formal education?\n\nR.R.: I don't have a degree —I'm self‐educated. I sympathize with the students who say that the schools are not meeting their needs. And I tell my children that school doesn't prepare you for life, only for duty—if that. But they're more conservative in this respect than I am. They complain about school, but they haven't the courage to quit."
