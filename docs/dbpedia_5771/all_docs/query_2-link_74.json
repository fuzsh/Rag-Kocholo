        "text": "Atul Prasad Sen is a well-known name in Bengali language literature and music. He was a poet, lyricist and singer. Atul Prasad Sen is mainly known to Bengali speakers as a musician and composer. His songs are mainly Swadeshi Sangeet, devotional songs and love songs; This is divided into three categories. But the pain of his personal life has more or less influenced all kinds of songs. That's why most of his songs have become karuna-rasa main.\n\nBirth and residence\n\nHe was born on October 20, 1871 in his mother's house in Dhaka. Their original residence is Magar village of Naria upazila of Shariatpur. Atulprasad lost his father at a very young age. Fatherless as a child, Atul Prasad was brought up by his paternal grandfather Kalarayana Gupta, a devout devotee, Sukantha singer and composer of devotional songs. Later, these qualities of maternal grandmother also took place in her. His maternal grandfather taught him music and devotional songs. Ramprasad, Nazrul Islam, Rabindranath in the world of Bengali music. And Dwijendralal Roy along with Atul Prasad's name is still remembered with respect.\n\nEducation begins\n\nAfter passing the entrance exam in 1890, Atul Prasad joined the Presidency College (now Presidency University) in Calcutta and studied for a while. Later, at the age of 20, Atul moved to England to study barrister. On the way to England the gondola-drivers were singing a song near Venice, how sweet! Atul Prasad first wrote a famous song - 'Uth Go Bharatalakshmi' while sitting on the ship, enthralled by the melody of this foreign song. He had the privilege of visiting the British Museum while studying for the barrister at Middle Temple, London. He met Chittaranjan Das, Sarojini Naidu, Arvind Ghosh, Dwijendralal Roy and others as friends in London.\n\nAfter the death of his father Ramprasad, Atulprasad's mother Hemantshashi Devi, 43, married for the second time to Chittaranjan Das' Jyathamshai, a Brahmin leader, Durgamohan Das, 49, a father of six. Tarun Atul Prasad is the eldest son of the house, three younger sisters at home. In Calcutta, Grandmother Krishnagobinda lived in Gupta's house, and did not approach her mother out of pride. The biggest pain in his life came from his mother. Stubbornness comes from pride, studied at Presidency College, later went abroad to become a barrister. Alone in his room crying for his mother, uncle's daughter Hemkusum came and sat nearby. Comforts, inspires. Must be big in life, very big.\n\nlove and marriage\n\nAfter successfully passing the law examination, he returned to Bengal in 1894 and began practice as a 'junior' to Satyendraprasanna Singh in Calcutta and Rangpur. In London, Atul Prasad falls in love with his cousin Hemkusum, the daughter of great-grandmother Krishnagobinda Gupta. The love is so deep that one day Atul Prasad suddenly announced that he will marry Hemkusum, parents and relatives were shocked. On all four sides, Shih Shih Rob got up, Mamato-Pistuto siblings, the marriage is British or Hindu, this marriage is not valid under any law. Meanwhile, Hemkusum and Nachhorbanda will marry. For so long, the love flow of two hearts has flowed, seeking recognition in shame, but who will give this recognition, which is prohibited by society and law. Lawyer barrister Atulprasad advised his guru Satyendraprasanna Singh, if you want to get married, do it abroad. Hemkusum-Atulprasad married in 1900, in a church in the village of Greatnagreen in Scotland, where marriage is possible. The early years of the 20th century were just beginning.\n\nMarried, but back home? He tried for a few days, if he could stay in the bill. Earnings are big. Two sons Dilipkumar-Nilipkumar are born, have to run the family. Nilipkumar also died of fever after seven months. Unable to work, Hemkusum is forced to sell jewelry. In 1902, he returned to Calcutta with his surviving son Dilipkumar, but not a face to practice. At that time, none of the relatives came forward to help them. Barrister friend Mumtaz Hossain gave advice, let's go to Lucknow. Many Bengalis live in Lucknow in Nababi Nagar, Thumri-Tappa-Shayeri in Uttar Pradesh; Gomti's arrows are shining in education-literature-art. Lucknow, Atul Prasad came to Lucknow in appreciation of Guni, some friends also came forward to help. Became a member of Lucknow Bar Association, started practice in Lucknow Court.\n\nMusic was his soul\n\nMusic was his soul. He did not keep time for himself in his working life, he kept it for music. Dilipkumar Roy writes, \"In the age before us, four poets were blooming like flowers in devotional songs: Dwijendralal, Rabindranath, Rajinikanth and Atul Prasad.\" Kazi Nazrul Islam came after another three decades, Atul Prasad is the youngest and celebrated poet among them... Listening to his songs, it seems as if a simple cheerful poet-heart is talking about his heart through the daily tears of his joy, pain, hope and despair. .''\n\nAtulprasad wrote the song on many occasions! The songs of nationalism are retreating in the busyness of the 21st century, now they are stuck on the walls of 15th August, 23rd or 26th January, but after 'Janganaman Skipper' or 'Amar Sonar Bangla', the songs that are still heard speak of the shining eyes and firm fists of the people in a subjugated country. Remember, the author of many of them is Atulprasad Sen. 'Get up Bharatalakshmi', 'My pride is my hope, A mori Bengali language', 'Be gentle in religion, be brave in action', 'Say, say, say, Shata-veena-venu-rabe'—\n\nRabindranath' And Atul\n\nRabindranath loved him very much. In 1896, Rabindranath formed the 'Khamkheyali Sabha', the members of which were Dwijendralal, Maharaja Jagadindranarayan Roy, Abanindranath Tagore, Lokendranath Palit... and many others. Atul Prasad is the youngest civilization. Music, literature - everything was done in a funny way. Atul Prasad himself gave an account of the gathering: 'Khamkheyali Majlis was hosted by the supremely humorous Dwijendralal Roy... We all joined in his chorus of laughter, Rabindranath being the leader of the chorus. Dwijendralal would sing - 'Hote Pattem I am a great big hero' and Rabindranath would shake his head and sing the chorus - 'It would have been, it would have been'...\n\nAtulprasad is also a witness to Rabindranath's song-composition. Rabindranath went out early before sunrise, Atulprasad followed in hiding. He saw that the poet went and sat on a rock, in front of the morning sky, the eternal Himalayas. Rabindranath is humming and composing the song, 'Ae Lovinu Sanga Tab Sundar Hey Sundar'. Atul Prasad, the secret witness of the birth of this song, heard from behind and ran away to the house. Two or three days later when the poet was singing 'Ae Lovinu' in public, Atul Prasad said, I have heard this song before. The poet is surprised! When Atul Prasad broke the secret, Rabindranath's pleasant comment, 'You are a big bad boy, do you understand how to listen to this every day?' Rabindranath came to Lucknow, Atul Prasad himself wrote a song at his birthday celebration, and sang the song to the young hillbilly Sanyal, 'Come, come, come, Bharatbhushan..' .'' Rabindranath dedicated his book 'Parishod' to Atul Prasad.\n\nIn that era, Atul Prasad built a big house in Keshar Bagh, Lucknow for 33 thousand rupees. The group of singers used to sit there. Bada loved Thumri, brought the movement of Thumri in his songs with effortless skill. Dilipkumar Roy, Pahari Sanyal, Sahana Devi taught those songs and gave them away. Kolkata, Rampur, Gbalior, Mathura, Indore, Kashi, Hyderabad, all the tabard artist's address was Lucknow Sensaheb's home. Vishnunarayan Bhatkhandeji himself and his illustrious disciple Srikrishna Ratanjankar came. Hearing 'Bhavani Dayani Mahabakbani' in Shrikrishna Ratanjankar's voice, Atulprasad Bhairavi sang 'Ke dake amare/ Bina se sakhare rahite mon nare!' This music-monk used to run to wherever he found good music, sukantha. Sahana Devi wrote, 'I have rarely seen such a person become so happy after listening to music. He could not think of what to do.' Amal Hom called him 'Aklantakantha'.\n\nBengalis think that people who live with music become soft and not workers. Atul Prasad was the epitome of exception to this concept. A practitioner by profession, he became president of the Oudh Bar Association. He is the first Indian to hold the post. In those days, there was conflict between the judges and the lawyers, and the Lucknow court was getting bad name because of it. Taking it into his own hands, barrister Atul Prasad Sen restored the dignity of the court. The Pravasi Banga Sahitya Sammelan (now named Nikhil Bharat Banga Sahitya Sammelan) was started in Lucknow to keep Bengali language and literature alive among the diaspora Bengalis. Meetings of expatriate Bengalis were held in Lucknow, Allahabad, Kashi, various cities. Many Saraswats including Rabindranath came from Bengal. Atul Prasad was the rite of this Sahitya Yajna. Gunijan organized the reception and presided over the meeting. He arranged the publication of the literature conference magazine 'Uttara' with his own money. He was one of the founder-members of Lucknow University, from the Vice-Chancellor to the professors, everyone was impressed by his qualities. The association with Ramakrishna Sevashram in Lucknow was deep. He built 'Ram Prasad Hall', 'Hemantshashi Shushrushalay' named after his parents in Sevashram at his own expense, and sang kirtan himself on the day of inauguration. Acharya Prafullachandra Roy brought medicines worth several hundred rupees from Bengal Chemical for the patients.\n\nDurgamohan, the second husband of Atulprasad's mother Hemantshashi, died while living in Lucknow. After Durga Mohan's death, Hemantshashi moved to Lucknow to As's son's family. At this time, mother-in-law's disrespect started. As a result, husband and wife divorce. Attempts to reconcile and stay together did not succeed. The conflict between Hemantshashi and Hemkusum was never resolved. After Hemantshashi's death, her photo was hung in the room. Hemkusum demanded to remove it. But Atul Prasad is unwilling to disrespect his mother's image in this way. Now Hemkusum left her husband's house forever, never to return.\n\nHis married life was full of pain. Wife Hemkusum used to rent a separate house in Lucknow for a long time. Atul Prasad wants to bring his mother Hemantshashi to himself, and keeps it, which angers Hemkusum. Atul Prasad is so close to everyone, not close to him, so proud. But both of them are full of love. Even so, Rabindranath's reception, Hemkusum came and did all the arrangements with a smile by himself, at the end of the ceremony he went back to Abhimani's rented house, not Atul Prasad's house. Atulaprasad's song used to sing in the throat of well-educated Hemkusum during parting. Atulprasad also spent many lonely nights in tears, writing and singing songs. Quoting Goethe, Dilipkumar Roy writes, 'Deep sorrow is worth it if even a song emerges from that sorrow. Pain and intense sorrow are the main source of Atul Prasad's literary and musical creations. The endless turmoil of family life led him to the path of creativity. In fact, he chose music as a way to escape from pain. It is through music that he overcomes the conflict of expectations and achievements and has reached a new experience of life. Despite the severe injuries, he believed in a great power and sought comfort and care in his poetry, his songs. We find such an experienced man in the poems and songs of Rabindranath. In fact, music was Atul Prasad's soul.\n\nFrom the end of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, Atul Prasad was one of those who were able to express their specialty in writing Bengali poetry despite wandering in the sphere of influence of Rabindra Pratibha. Although his musical repertoire is limited compared to contemporary lyricists, many of Atul Prasad's songs show musical originality; And that's why he has got a unique place in the world of Bengali music. His songs are specially established as Atul Prasad songs.\n\nThungri was Atul Prasad's favorite form. Rabindranath's main inspiration was Dhrupad, and Dwijendralal Roy's Khayal and Toppa. But it was from Thungri that Atul Prasad got his main inspiration. Atulprasad's favorite ragas were Khambaj and Bhairavi. He has used A-Ragadva to varying degrees. Atul Prasad also played a significant role in composing ghazals in Bengali. In this regard, he is also the predecessor of Kazi Nazrul Islam.\n\nAtul Prasad is the originator of thungri genre in Bengali music. He was the first to compose ghazals in Bengali. The number of Bengali ghazals composed by him is 6-7. All his songs were compiled in Gitipunj (1931). The last edition of this book (1957) contained many unpublished songs. Atulprasad's number of songs is 208. Some of the famous songs of Atul Prasad Sen are Michhe Tui Bhabis Mann, Sarre Bas Re Balo, Bandhua, Nind Nahi Ankhipate, etc. Among the patriotic songs he composed are famous Ur Go Bharat-Lakshmi, Bollo Bollo Bollo Sabe, Ho Dharmete Dhir. His pride, my hope, a dead Bengali language! The song provided special inspiration in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Atul Prasad's songs are divided into five categories namely Deva, Prakriti, Swadesh, Manava and Miscellanea. Rabindranath Tagore was a special connoisseur of this song. Krishna Chattopadhyay is a prominent musician of this genre known as Atulprasadi song.\n\nThungri was Atul Prasad's favorite form. Rabindranath's main inspiration was Dhrupad, and Dwijendralal Roy's Khayal and Toppa. But it was from Thungri that Atul Prasad got his main inspiration. Atulprasad's favorite ragas were Khambaj and Bhairavi. He has used A-Ragadva to varying degrees. Atul Prasad also played a significant role in composing ghazals in Bengali. In this regard, he is also the predecessor of Kazi Nazrul Islam.\n\nHis total number of songs is only 208 and out of them only 50-60 songs are popular as songs. Edited by Atul Prasad's cousin Sahana Devi, 71 songs with notation were published in two volumes titled Kakali (1930). His other songs were also published in two separate books called Gitipunja and Akaya Gan. Around 1922-23 , the first recordings of Atul Prasad's songs came out of Calcutta in the voices of Sahana Devi and Haren Chattopadhyay.\n\ntime of death\n\nHe died on 26 August 1934 while living in Lucknow, British India. He was cremated there. His cremated remains are buried in the cemetery next to the Kaoraid (Kaoradi) Brahma temple under Sreepur upazila of Gazipur district. There is a memorial plaque here. It was written \"Moder Garab, Moder Asha, A Mori Bangla Bhasha! / In your lap, in your mouth, how much peace is love!'' Later it was renewed. The new plaque reads:"
