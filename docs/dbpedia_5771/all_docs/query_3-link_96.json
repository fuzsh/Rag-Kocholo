        "text": "Category: poetry\n\nApar Sansar by Ramprasad Sen\n\nThe great sage and mystic poet Ramprasad Sen composed many gems in the eighteenth century that are popular to this day in Bengal. In fact there is a special category called “Ramprasadi”, attributed to him, which falls under the broader Bhakti or devotional genre of music.\n\nThe song Apar Sansar¶, , or fathomless Sansar, the cosmos of creation, is a prayer to Ma Kali, the divine mother representational of universal female energy widely worshiped in India. In Bengal, there have been several great devotees of Kali, including the towering saint Sri Ramakrishna. Yogananda, inspired by Ramprasad, translated the song “Emon din ki hobe Ma Tara”, in the now well-known verse in his Cosmic Chants book titled “Will that day O come to me Ma”.\n\nIn Apar Sansar, Ramprasad invokes Kali to help him navigate the treacherous sea of Sansar.\n\nApar Sanar – Ramprasad Sen by Mystic Wanderer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\nThis boundless cosmos, there’s no way across\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nAt your feet my faith, and all of my wealth,\n\nprotector from woes, be my savior\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nBeholding the waves, and the waters’ rise,\n\nthe body shivers fearing its demise.\n\nA boat in your feet, I’m blessed to receive,\n\nyour humble servant, hold me together\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nThe storms carry on, in ceaseless abandon\n\nmy body quivers, shaking in wanton.\n\nGrant my hearts’ delight, Tara’s name is light.\n\nYour name O Tara, essence of cosmos.\n\nEons slip away, Kali unattained,\n\nPrasad laments that this life is in vain.\n\nSever worldly banes that refuse to wane.\n\nMotherless, Tarini*, who to surrender?\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\n¶ Sansar (संसार) – the world of change in Dharmic cosmology\n\n*Tarini – Divine mother as savior\n\nHot chocolate\n\nHot chocolate by Mystic Wanderer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\nHot chocolate\n\nruns down my gut.\n\nMy mind at ease,\n\nshapes the thoughts\n\nas they emerge,\n\nflowing freely,\n\nas words from pen\n\nonto paper.\n\nTinkling spoons,\n\nthe sibilant\n\ncoffee machine,\n\nbarista calls –\n\n“Tall mocha”! or\n\n“Grande caramel latte”!\n\nAnother gulp.\n\nA few more lines.\n\nThen mind wriggles.\n\nVociferous.\n\nWants me to leave.\n\n“You can’t write here,\n\nwhat cacophony!\n\nThat kid is loud.\n\nThat woman in front\n\non her cell phone…”\n\nMy cup empty,\n\nnow it’s just me,\n\nand the people,\n\nthe sounds and lights,\n\nthe radio,\n\nringing cell phones,\n\nbarista’s calls –\n\nnothing between.\n\nUnless I get\n\nanother cup.\n\nAmalkanti wanted to be sunshine by Nirendranath Chakraborty\n\nNirendranath Chakraborty was a noted Bengali poet from India, recipient of Sahitya Akademi award, India’s National Academy of letters.\n\nThis is a translation of his Bengali poem, অমলকান্তি রোদ্দুর হতে চেয়েছিল, which literally means –\n\nAmalkanti wanted to be sunshine\n\nTranslated by Mystic Wanderer\n\nAmalkanti wanted to be sunshine by Mystic Wanderer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License\n\nAmalkanti is my friend,\n\nwe went to school together.\n\nHe would always be late to class, couldn’t answer questions.\n\nWhen asked a Śabdarūpa*\n\nhe would cast such a forlorn gaze at the window\n\nthat it would make us feel sorry for him.\n\nSome of us wanted to be teachers, some doctors, some lawyers.\n\nAmalkanti didn’t want to be any of these.\n\nHe wanted to be sunshine.\n\nThe coy sunshine that lingers on to jamun¶ leaves like a little smile\n\nafter a brief spell of afternoon rain.\n\nSome of us became teachers, some doctors, some lawyers.\n\nAmalkanti could not become sunshine.\n\nHe now works in a dimly lit printing press.\n\nSometimes he comes to see me,\n\nhas tea, chitchats and then bids adieu.\n\nI see him out to the door.\n\nThose of us who became teachers\n\ncould have easily become doctors,\n\nthose that wanted to be doctors would have lost little if they became lawyers.\n\nYet everyone’s wishes came true, save Amalkanti.\n\nAmalkanti could not become sunshine.\n\nThe same Amalkanti who, dreaming of sunshine,\n\nwanted to become that sunshine one day.\n\n* I haven’t found a good equivalent of this in English. Google translate, in the absence of a Bengali dictionary or sage advice, notes it thus:\n\nthe variation of the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, by which its grammatical case, number, and gender are identified.\n\n¶An evergreen fruiting tree common in India\n\nবল মা কি আচারে, রামপ্রসাদ সেন\n\nFollowing my previous post on the translation, here is the original Bengali poem by Sri Ramprasad Sen.\n\nবল মা কি আচারে\n\nরামপ্রসাদ সেন\n\nবল মা কি আচারে\n\nকি মন্ত্র বিচারে\n\nকোন উপচারে পূজিব মা\n\nকি নামে ডাকিব\n\nকি মন্ত্র পাঠিব\n\nকি দিয়ে গঠিব\n\nতোমার প্রতিমা\n\nশুনেছি পুরানে বেদাগামতন্ত্রে\n\nজীত্শক্তি মা তুমি জীব দেহযন্ত্রে\n\nমা তুমি জাগিবে কোন উদ্বোধন মন্ত্রে\n\nকে দেবে সে মন্ত্র বল হরবামা\n\nআবাহন মন্ত্র ডাকিব কোন ঘটে\n\nযে ঘটে যা ঘটাও সে ঘটে তাই ঘটে\n\nজগতমাঝে তব পটিয়সী মায়া\n\nঘটে পটে রটাও তোমার মহিমা\n\nফল পূজা করে লভিব কি ফল\n\nকি ফলে পূজিলে পাব ইষ্টফল\n\nচরণেতে যার চতুর্বর্গফল *\n\nমোক্ষফলের বৃক্ষ হর মনোরমা\n\n* ধর্ম, অর্থ, কাম, মোক্ষ\n\nHow to call you, Mother? A translation of a song by Ramprasad Sen\n\nBengal, despite its current state of dilapidation, has produced some towering saints in its rich history. Ramprasad Sen can surely be counted among them. A great eighteenth century mystic and Kali devotee, he was also a gifted poet and singer. His songs are popular to this day. Paramahansa Yogananda was a great admirer of Sri Ramprasad, his song Will that day O’ come to me Ma an English rendition of a Ramprasad song.\n\nSometime back, I came across this gem (from the Bengali film “Sadhak Ramprasad”) by contemporary thumri maestro Ramkumar Chatterjee, and was compelled to its translation. Audio track is available here (for native Bengali speakers and people who know the language), and here is my attempt to convey it’s essence in English:\n\nHow to call you, Mother?\n\nTell me Mother –\n\nWith what rite expression\n\nby what incantation,\n\nwith which concoction to worship you Ma?\n\nWhat chants should I narrate,\n\nwith what mantras supplicate,\n\nwhat should I equate your form with O Ma?\n\nVedas and Puranas, I have heard in their hymns\n\nthat you are the force of victory in beings.\n\nArise you will Mother on which mantra’s wings?\n\nWho will dispense that mantra to me Ma?\n\nA mantra of ascension should I use on which urn?\n\nIt is by your will that events take their turn.\n\nYour seductive maya pervades humanity,\n\nas you manifest your grace in reality.\n\nBy the worship of fruits, O what should I gain?\n\nWith which fruit of prayer should you I obtain?\n\nFruits of the world at your feet you contain –\n\nThe tree of ultimate expression you are Ma.\n\n© Mystic Wanderer, 2012\n\nRead more about Sri Ramprasad\n\nHow to call you, Mother by Mystic Wanderer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.\n\nAuld Lang Syne\n\nWishing all who enter this blog, by design or accident, a year of great cheer and reading!\n\nThree six five and more\n\nof fleeting days of yore\n\nhave lapsed, o’ believe\n\nsince first keystrokes of me.\n\nDormant mask I wore\n\nthrough most this year; remorse\n\nI now feel slightly.\n\nFuture be more sprightly ."
