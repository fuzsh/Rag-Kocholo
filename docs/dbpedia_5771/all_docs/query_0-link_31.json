        "text": "The great sage and mystic poet Ramprasad Sen composed many gems in the eighteenth century that are popular to this day in Bengal. In fact there is a special category called “Ramprasadi”, attributed to him, which falls under the broader Bhakti or devotional genre of music.\n\nThe song Apar Sansar¶, , or fathomless Sansar, the cosmos of creation, is a prayer to Ma Kali, the divine mother representational of universal female energy widely worshiped in India. In Bengal, there have been several great devotees of Kali, including the towering saint Sri Ramakrishna. Yogananda, inspired by Ramprasad, translated the song “Emon din ki hobe Ma Tara”, in the now well-known verse in his Cosmic Chants book titled “Will that day O come to me Ma”.\n\nIn Apar Sansar, Ramprasad invokes Kali to help him navigate the treacherous sea of Sansar.\n\nApar Sanar – Ramprasad Sen by Mystic Wanderer is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\n\nThis boundless cosmos, there’s no way across\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nAt your feet my faith, and all of my wealth,\n\nprotector from woes, be my savior\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nBeholding the waves, and the waters’ rise,\n\nthe body shivers fearing its demise.\n\nA boat in your feet, I’m blessed to receive,\n\nyour humble servant, hold me together\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\nThe storms carry on, in ceaseless abandon\n\nmy body quivers, shaking in wanton.\n\nGrant my hearts’ delight, Tara’s name is light.\n\nYour name O Tara, essence of cosmos.\n\nEons slip away, Kali unattained,\n\nPrasad laments that this life is in vain.\n\nSever worldly banes that refuse to wane.\n\nMotherless, Tarini*, who to surrender?\n\nmy dear Mother.\n\n¶ Sansar (संसार) – the world of change in Dharmic cosmology\n\n*Tarini – Divine mother as savior"
