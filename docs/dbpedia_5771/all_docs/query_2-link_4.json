        "text": "Kavi Ramprasad Sen ( 1720 - 1795) is believed to be born at Kumarhatta\n\nvillage near Halisahar. He was a great worshipper of Goddess Kali and\n\nwas Enlightened. He composed number of poems in praise of his Goddess.\n\nTwo of his most famous compilations are Vidyasunder and Kalikirtan. His\n\nworks have been translated in many foreign languages including english,\n\nfrench and german. He has become a legend in Bengal.\n\nThe place in Halisahar where he was Enlightened is now called as Ramprasad's Vite. But this is far from truth. This land was certainly owned by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family.\n\nRamakrishna Roy Choudhury of the family had inherited spritual influence from his ancestors like Kamdev Brahmachari and he too worshipped Goddess Kali. He created the Panchabati and engaged himself in meditation. He became one of the renowned spritual figures of his time and was honoured much by the people of Bengal. The place where he worshipped came to be known as Ramakrishna Dham.\n\nAfter his death, his daughter-in-law (eldest son's wife) Subhadra Devi requested Ramprasad to stay at Ramakrishna Dham and carry on the worship of the Goddess. She also wished to donate the land in favour of Ramprasad. Ramprasad also deeply influenced by Ramakrishna's devotion wished to meditate at the holy place and was highly pleased to accept the proposal. He thanked Suvadra Devi for giving him such an honour.\n\nRamprasad started worshipping his Goddess and here was Enlightened. Slowly the temple place became more popular and started to be termed as Ramprasad's Vite."
