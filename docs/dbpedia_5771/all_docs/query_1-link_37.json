        "text": "Image of Ramprasad Sen from \"Brihad Banga\" Dinendra Chadra Sen,\n\nCalcutta Univercity, Calcutta, 1935\n\nSadhak Rāmprasād Sen (Bengali: রামপ্রসাদ সেন; c. 1718 or c. 1723 – c. 1775) was a Hindu Shakta poet and saint of eighteenth century Bengal. His bhakti poems, known as Ramprasadi, are still popular in Bengal—they are usually addressed to the Hindu goddess Kali and written in Bengali. Stories of Ramprasad's life typically include legends and myths mixed with biographical details.\n\nIt is said that, Ramprasad was born into a Tantric family, and showed an inclination towards poetry from an early age. He became a disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric scholar and yogi. Ramprasad became well known for his devotional songs, eventually becoming the court poet of Raja Krishnachandra of Nadia. His life has been the subject of many stories depicting his devotion to, and relationship with, Kali. Ramprasad's literary works include Vidyasundar, Kali-kirtana, Krishna-kirtana and Shaktigiti.\n\nRamprasad is credited with creating a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk. His songs are sung today, with a popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit (\"Songs of Ramprasad\")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal\n\nBiographies of Ramprasad are a mixture of biography, metaphor, and legend.\n\nRamprasad was born in Garalgachha, in Hooghly District (at his maternal house), into a Tantric Baidya-Brahmin family. Due to the absence of birth records, his actual birth date is not known, but it is believed to be around 1718 or 1723. His father, Ramram Sen, was an Ayurvedic doctor and Sanskrit scholar. Ramprasad's mother Siddheswari was Ramram's second wife. Ramprasad was sent to a Sanskrit tol (school) where he learned Sanskrit grammar, literature, Persian, and Hindi. As a youth, he had a talent for poetry and learning new languages.\n\nRamram hoped his son would follow in his profession, but Ramprasad showed no interest in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused a great deal of anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali and the author of the Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) and worship of Kali.\n\nInstead of following his parents wishes and looking for a job, it is said that Ramprasad devoted most of his time to sadhana. Ramram died before he could make provisions to support the family. Forced finally by poverty, Ramprasad moved to Kolkata and worked as an accountant in the household of Durga Charan Mitra for a monthly salary of thirty rupees. According to traditional accounts, during his employment Ramprasad would write devotional songs to Kali. His fellow employees were appalled to see Ramprasad write poems in his account book, and reported him to their employer. Durga Charan Mitra, upon reading Ramprasad's work, was moved by his piety and literary skill. Instead of dismissing Ramprasad from work, he asked him to return to his village and compose songs to Kali, while continuing to pay his salary\n\nSadhana and poetry\n\nAfter returning to his village, Ramprasad spent most of his time in sadhana, meditation, and prayer. Traditional accounts tell of several esoteric sadhanas that he performed, including standing neck-deep in the river Ganges, singing songs to Kali. Ramprasad would regularly practice his sadhana in a panchavati: a grove with five trees—banyan, bael, amalaki, ashoka, and peepul—all regarded as holy in Tantric tradition. He would reportedly spend hours meditating on a panchamundi asana (an altar inside which are interred five skulls–that of a snake, frog, rabbit, fox, and man). According to popular stories he had a vision of Kali in her form of Adyashakti Mahamaya.\n\nRaja Krishnachandra of Nadia, a landlord under Nawab Sirajuddaula of Bengal, heard Ramprasad's hymns. Being an ardent devotee of Kali, he appointed Ramprasad as his court poet. Ramprasad rarely attended the Maharaja's court and would spend his time in sadhana and worship of Kali instead. Krishna Chandra became Ramprasad's benefactor, giving him 100 acres (0.40 km2; 0.16 sq mi) of tax free land. Ramprasad, in return, dedicated his book Vidyasundar (\"Beautiful Knowledge\") to the Maharaja. Krishna Chandra also gave Ramprasad the title Kaviranjana (\"Entertainer of poets\"). During the Maharaja's last years, Ramprasad stayed beside him, singing hymns to Kali. Ramprasad's mysticism was recognized by sufis and Nawab Sirajuddaula. Ramprasad is said to have visited the court of the Nawab at the Nawab's fervent request\n\nDeath\n\nDuring Ramprasad's old age, he was looked after by his son Ramdulal and daughter-in-law Bhagavati. A folk story is told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja on the night of Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he performed the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.\n\nHowever, recent documentary evidence, a Kabulatipatra dated April 1794 bearing the sign of Ramprasad Sen as a witness, clearly proves the fact that Ramprasad Sen was alive in 1794. The said Kabulatipatra has been preserved and displayed at Sabarna Sangrahashala in Barisha\n\nStories and legends\n\nIn Bengal, popular stories and legends are told of Ramprasad. One of the most well known stories is about a \"radiant girl\" who helped him one day. Ramprasad was repairing a fence with the assistance of his daughter, who left shortly thereafter. Soon a \"radiant girl\", whom he didn't recognize, came to help him. After finishing the task, she vanished. According to the story, Ramprasad then realized that she was a manifestation of Kali.\n\nAnother popular story is told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad was on his way to the river for his daily ritual bath when a beautiful young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the \"play of Divine Mother.\" Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, \"I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed.\" Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, \"Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe.\n\nRamprasad Sen is regarded as one of the notable figures of the bhakti movement in Bengal during the eighteenth century. He is credited with popularizing the bhakti Shakta tradition and Shyama Sangeet—devotional songs to the goddess Kali. Ramprasad was the first Shakta poet to address Kali with such intimate devotion, and to sing of her as a tender loving mother or even as a little girl. After him, a school of Shakta poets continued the Kali-bhakti tradition.\n\nRamprasad created a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. This new form took root in Bengali culture for the next hundred and fifty years, with hundreds of poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, and bringing together styles of music that included classical, semi-classical, and folk. His poetic style has been described as \"sweet, familiar and unsophisticated\", though his lyrics were sung in classical style rather than a folk style. Two of his notable successors as composers in the same style were Kamalakanta Bhattacarya and Mahendranath Bhattacarya.\n\nRamprasad's songs are known as Ramprasadi. The devotion to Kali often included as a background the events in Bengal during his time, such as the Bengal famine of 1770, economic hardships, and the deterioration of rural culture. His poems were very popular during his lifetime.\n\nRamprasad's literary works include Vidyasundar (or Kalikaman-gala) (ca. sixth or seventh decade of the 18th century), Kali-kirtana, the fragmentary Krishna-kirtana, and Shaktigiti. Kali-kirtana is a collection of lyric and narrative poetry describing the early life of Uma. Krishna-kirtana is an incomplete book of poems and songs to Krishna—the complete collection is yet to be discovered. Vidyasundara Kavya is written in a narrative style that was already popular in Bengali literature, telling the traditional love story of Vidya and Sundara—children of kings who are aided by Kali in meeting, falling in love, and marrying. Shaktigiti is Ramprasad's well known and respected work, in which he expresses his deepest feelings and love for Kali. In Shaktigiti, he shares the most intimate relationship with Kali—a child who can both love and quarrel with his mother over the inequities of human birth.\n\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa, a mystic of nineteenth century Bengal, often sang his songs and regarded Ramprasad as his beloved poet. Many of these songs are recorded in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, which at one point mentions, \"…he (Ramakrishna) would spend hours singing the devotional songs of great devotees of the Mother, such as Kamalakanta and Ramprasad. Those rhapsodic songs describing direct vision of God…\"Paramhansa Yogananda also was an admirer of Ramprasad and his devotional songs, frequently singing them. Sister Nivedita compared Ramprasad with the English poet William Blake.\n\nRamprasad's songs are still popular in Bengal and recited regularly in the worship of Kali. Scholar Shuma Chakrovarty notes that his songs are \"broadcast over the radio and sung on the streets and in the homes and temples of Calcutta by a cross-section of people—children, the elderly, housewives, businessmen, scholars, the illiterate, monks, householders, and the youth of all classes\". Many of his songs were sung by popular Shyama Sangeet singers like Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Pannalal Bhattacharya, and Anup Ghosal. Still his master literature combination of simple words in the songs melts one's hearts and floods the eye with tears. An [anekanta]vadin reading of Ramprasad's texts is also found.\n\nMIND DON'T SLEEP\n\nSo I say : Mind, don’t you sleep\n\nOr Time is going to get in and steal from you.\n\nYou hold on to the sword of Kali’s name.\n\nThe shield of Tara’s name.\n\nCan Death overwhelm you?\n\nSound Kali’s name on a horn and sound it loud.\n\nChant ‘Durga, Durga,’\n\nUntil you bring the dawn around.\n\nIf She won’t save you in this Dark Age-\n\nBut how many great sinners have been saved!\n\nIs Ramprasad then\n\nSo unsalvageable a rogue?\n\nWHY IS MOTHER KALI SO RADIANTLY BLACK ?\n\nWhy is Mother Kali so radiantly black?\n\nBecause she is so powerful,\n\nthat even mentioning her name destroys delusion.\n\nBecause she is so beautiful,\n\nLord Shiva, Conquerer of death,\n\nlies blissfully vanquished,\n\nbeneath the red soled feet.\n\nThere are subtle hues of blackness,\n\nBut her bright complexion\n\nis the mystery that is utterly black,\n\noverwhelmingly black, wonderfully black.\n\nWhen she awakens in the lotus shrine\n\nwithin the heart’s secret cave,\n\nher blackness becomes the mystic illumination\n\nthat causes the twelve petal blossom there\n\nto glow more intensely than golden embers.\n\nHer lovely form is the incomparable\n\nKali- black blacker than the King of Death.\n\nWhoever gazes upon this radiant blackness falls eternally in love\n\nand feels no attraction to any other,\n\ndiscovering everywhere only her.\n\nThis poet sighs deeply,\n\n“Where is this brilliant lady, this black light beyond luminosity?\n\nThough I have never seen her, simply hearing her name,\n\nthe mind becomes absorbed completely in her astonishing reality.\n\nOm Kali! Om Kali! Om Kali!\n\nWHO IN THIS WORLD\n\nWho in this world\n\ncan understand what\n\nMother Kali really is?\n\nThe six systems of philosophy\n\nremain powerless to describe Her.\n\nShe is the inmost awareness\n\nof the sage who realizes\n\nthat Consciousness alone exists.\n\nShe is the life blossoming within\n\nthe creatures of the universe.\n\nBoth macrocosm and microcosm\n\nare lost within Mother’s Womb.\n\nNow can you sense\n\nhow indescribable She is?\n\nThe yogi meditates upon Her\n\nin the six subtle nerve centres\n\nas She sports with delight\n\nthrough the lotus wilderness\n\nof the pristine human body,\n\nplaying with Her Consort,\n\nShiva, the Great Swan.\n\nWhen anyone attempts to know Her,\n\nthe singer of this song laughs.\n\nCan you swim across\n\na shore less ocean?\n\nYet the child in me still\n\nreaches out to touch the moon.\n\nSHE'S PLAYING IN MY HEART\n\nShe’s playing in my heart.\n\nWhatever I think, I think Her name.\n\nI close my eyes and She’s in there\n\nGarlanded with human heads.\n\nCommon sense, know-how-gone,\n\nSo they say I’m crazy. Let them.\n\nAll I ask, my crazy Mother,\n\nIs that You stay put.\n\nRamprasad cries out: Mother, don’t\n\nReject this lotus heart You live in\n\nDon’t despise this human offering\n\nAt Your feet.\n\nDOES SUFFERING SCARE ME ?\n\nDoes suffering scare me? O Mother,\n\nLet me suffer in this world. Do I require more?\n\nSuffering runs ahead of me and runs after me.\n\nI carry it on my head and set up a stand\n\nIn the bazaar to peddle it.\n\nI’m a poison worm, I thrive on poison.\n\nI carry it wherever I go.\n\nPrasad says: Mother, lift off my load.\n\nI need a little rest. It’s amazing!\n\nOthers brag about their happiness,\n\nI brag about my suffering.\n\nO LONGING MIND\n\nO longing mind,\n\nconsecrate your being to pure love.\n\nTurn every thought to Goddess Tara.\n\nShe will bear you tenderly across the raging sea\n\nof separation and individuality.\n\nBe utterly dedicated to her reality.\n\nCry aloud Ma Kali, Ma Kali.\n\nKnow that she can clarify\n\nthe inconceivable maze of relativity.\n\nTo hope for assistance and guidance through this world\n\nfrom wealth, relatives, and religious rites\n\nprovides no profound solution.\n\nHave you forgotten that everyone is lost?\n\nWhere are you now? Why are you traveling?\n\nThis cosmos is the strange theater where souls act,\n\nwearing various costumes and disguises.\n\nThis intricate play of transparent energy\n\nis initiated, sustained, and dissolved by Kali,\n\nwho is the dream power of Absolute Reality.\n\nAt this very moment, you are resting\n\non the vast lap of Mother’s cosmic dream\n\nthat you misperceive\n\nas the narrow prison of suffering.\n\nWhy abandon the kingdom of awareness\n\nto obsession with self and disdain for others,\n\nto hollow passion and abject clinging?\n\nYou are creating a disease without a remedy.\n\nThe brief day of your earthly life is almost over.\n\nMeditate now on beautiful Black Tara.\n\nShe is seated upon the jewel island of essence\n\nin the transparent sea of ultimacy.\n\nThis poet sings drunkenly:\n\n“Tara! Tara! Tara!\n\nYour name is ambrosia.\n\nMay all beings enter the secret sanctuary\n\nthrough this name,\n\ntasting your unique sweetness,\n\nself-luminous awareness.”"
