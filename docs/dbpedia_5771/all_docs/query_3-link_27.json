        "text": "Origin\n\nPrasad : Indian (northern and southern states): from a personal name based on Sanskrit prasāda ‘favor grace offering gift’. In the northern states it probably evolved into a surname from use as the final element in compound personal namesIf such as Deviprasad meaning ‘gift of a goddess’ or Jagannathprasad ‘gift of the lord of the world (i.e. Shiva)’.\n\nPrasek : Czech (Prášek): nickname for a miller's apprentice from Czech prášek a diminutive of prach ‘dust’.\n\nPrashad : Indian: variant of Prasad. This surname is also established in Guyana.\n\nPrashar : Hindu and Sikh probably from Sanskrit Parāśara the name of a sage.\n\nPrasher : perhaps a variant of Preacher.\n\nPraska : Czech (mainly Praská): unexplained. This surname is very rare in Czechia.\n\nPrasla : Indian (Gujarat): Muslim habitational name from Prinsla village in Gujarat.\n\nPrasse : German: nickname for a gourmet from Middle High German bras Middle Low German bras pras ‘noise; feasting’.\n\nPrast : 1: North German: occupational name from Middle Low German pravest ‘provost’. See also Provost.2: German: nickname for an ostentatious person from Middle High German brast ‘pageantry show display’.3: Austrian German: dialect form of Propst.\n\nBrassel : German: nickname for a glutton from Middle High German brasseln prasseln ‘to indulge or feast’.\n\nBrasser : 1: Dutch: occupational name for a brewer or a nickname for a heavy drinker derived from brassen ‘to brew’ also ‘to soak to hit something up’.2: German: nickname for a person fond of eating and drinking from brassen prassen ‘to indulge’.\n\nDuprat : French (mainly southwestern): topographic name meaning ‘from the meadow’ a variant of Dupré (see Dupre and Prat); or a habitational name with fused preposition and definite article du ‘from the’ for someone from Le Prat the name of several places in various parts of France. Compare Dupart Dupras and Pratte.\n\nPenpraze : from Penpraze in Sithney or Penpraze in Illogan (both Cornwall).

This surname is found mainly in Guyana and also in Suriname and in the West Indies; it is not used in India.\n\nPraed : unexplained. Apparently from Middle Cornish *prad ‘meadow’ (Modern Cornish pras) but there are insuperable difficulties in attributing it to one of the places now called Praze (Sithney Grade and Saint Erth parishes) because the Cornish change of [d] to [z] took place before the main era of surname development. That is a surname from one of these places should be Prase or Praze but there is no trace of such names.\n\nRampersad : Indian: altered form of Ramprasad.
