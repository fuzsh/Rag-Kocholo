For this to work, you need a Unicode-capable browser plus devanagari and bengali fonts. Otherwise, you may see question marks or odd little squares.\n\nThe songs composed in the eighteenth century by RÄmprasÄd Sen are undoubtedly a milestone in the history of KÄlÄ« worship. The question is, how far is this milestone from the beginning of the road?\n\n*****\n\nThe last half century has seen a shift in academic interest away from ancient and medieval literature in Sanskrit, the classical language of India, and towards more recent literature in languages of everyday modern speech, such as Bengali.\n\nThe direction Iâve travelled in my reading has been the reverse. My attention has shifted from RÄmprasÄd, who praised KÄlÄ« in Bengali, to his Sanskrit antecedents.\n\nHow RÄmprasÄd portrays KÄlÄ«\n\nSome of the things that impressed me when I first picked up Sinhaâs English edition of RÄmprasÄdâs poetry 1, around 1985...\n\n1. The richness of imagery. I was not surprised to find KÄlÄ« described as a dark naked figure with a sword and a garland of heads, as Iâd seen plenty of pictures where she looks like this. But I wasnât necessarily expecting to find her depicted as a tree with four fruits 2 , or as a boat 3\n\nà¦à§ à¦®à¦¨, à¦¬à§à§à¦¾à¦¤à§ à¦¯à¦¾à¦¬à¦¿ à¥¤\n\nà¦à¦¾à¦²à§-à¦à¦²à§à¦ªà¦¤à¦°à§-à¦¤à¦²à§ à¦à¦¿à§à¦¾ à¦à¦¾à¦°à¦¿ à¦«à¦² à¦à§à§à¦¾à§à§ à¦à¦¾à¦¬à¦¿ à¥¤à¥¤\n\nÄy man, beá¹Äte jÄbi,\n\nkÄlÄ«-kalpataru-tale giyÄ cÄri phal kuá¹Äye khÄbi.\n\nâÂ RÄmprasÄd\n\nCome, oh my mind, letâs go for a walk\n\nto the foot of the tree of fulfilment that is KÄlÄ«\n\nwhere you will gather and eat the four fruits.\n\n2. Various sacred feminine names, such as KÄlÄ«, DurgÄ and TÄrÄ, are treated as belonging to the same Mother.\n\n3. KÄlÄ« is described as Åivaâs partner, whose glances charm him. 4 That is, she has qualities ascribed to the pleasing aspect of the Goddess (known as UmÄ, SatÄ«, PÄrvatÄ«) although RÄmprasÄd does imply that KÄlÄ« is more than the wife of Åiva.5\n\n4. KÄlÄ« and Ká¹á¹£á¹a are identified. The lady with the garland of heads becomes the young man with the garland of flowers.6\n\n5. Emphasis on personal devotion as the way to find KÄlÄ«.\n\n6. KÄlÄ« is said to present in every household, specifically in the encounter of man and woman, bhairava and bhairavÄ«.7\n\nIâve described RÄmprasÄd as my guru in a previous Ferment. 8 When I visited India in 1995, I made a point of visiting his home town, Halisahar, 34 miles north of central Calcutta.There is a small KÄlÄ« temple there, whose outer hall is decorated with scenes from the poetâs life.\n\nViews about RÄmprasÄdâs importance\n\nRÄmprasÄdâs importance has been emphasized by many of the twentieth century authors who have introduced the English speaking world to the vision of KÄlÄ«. In her book Kali the Mother, Sister Nivedita presents RÄmprasÄd as a teacher who expressed âa new religious intuitionâ, arising from âthe great heart of the vulgar... the imagination and conscience of the myriadsâ.9 In The Sword and the Flute, David Kinsley writes: âIt is difficult to exaggerate the importance of RÄmprasÄd in the history of KÄlÄ«âs worship in Bengal.â 10\n\nRachel Fell McDermott begins her book Mother of My Heart, Daughter of My Dreams with a quote from Aruá¹kumÄr Basu, a speaker at the BÄá¹ glÄ Akademi RÄmprasÄd-fest of 1997, who declares that RÄmprasÄd ârescued KÄlÄ« from the dacoits for the bhaktasâ. 11 (The word âdacoitsâ means bandits.)\n\nIn Devoted to the Goddess, Malcolm McLean argues that RÄmprasÄd developed a âpicture of the Goddessâ 12 which is actually a âsynthesisâ of several disparate traditions.\n\nThere is an element in all this I have never been very happy with: the assumption that RÄmprasÄd put together an essentially new picture of KÄlÄ«. Even if a woman as courageous and compassionate as Nivedita could write of âa new religious intuitionâ, I always doubted that alleged newness. So Iâve made a serious effort, over the years, to identify and study Sanskrit texts (for instance PurÄá¹as and Tantras) which can tell us more about how KÄlÄ« was understood before RÄmprasÄd.\n\nSanskrit portrayals of KÄlÄ«\n\nSome things Iâve found:\n\n1. The Niruttara Tantra says that KÄlÄ« âis the great desire-gratifying tree of those who long for the fourfold fruit of dharma, artha, kÄma, moká¹£aâ. 13 In the DevÄ« MÄhÄtmya, the boat is an image of DurgÄ, who is also called BhadrÄkÄlÄ«. 14\n\n2. In the KÄlikÄ PurÄá¹a, KÄlÄ« is the primary Goddess (also called MahÄmÄyÄ, YoganidrÄ etc) who incarnates as SatÄ« and PÄrvatÄ«, and charms Lord Åiva into involvement with this world. 15\n\n3. In the MahÄbhÄgavata PurÄá¹a, Ká¹á¹£á¹a is described as an incarnation of KÄlÄ«.16\n\n4. In the final section of the KÄlikÄ PurÄá¹a, there is the statement that the four goals of life are available to anyone who makes a personal declaration of devotion to KÄlÄ«.17\n\nà¤à¤¾à¤²à¤¿à¤à¤¾à¤¯à¥ à¤¨à¤®à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥à¤­à¥à¤¯à¤®à¤¿à¤¤à¤¿ à¤¯à¥ à¤­à¤¾à¤·à¤¤à¥ à¤¸à¥à¤µà¤¯à¤®à¥ à¥¤\n\nà¤¤à¤¸à¥à¤¯ à¤¹à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥ à¤¸à¥à¤¥à¤¿à¤¤à¤¾ à¤®à¥à¤à¥à¤¤à¤¿à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥à¤°à¤¿à¤µà¤°à¥à¤à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥ à¤µà¤¶à¤¾à¤¨à¥à¤à¤ à¥¥\n\nkÄlikÄyai namas tubhyam iti yo bhÄá¹£ate svayam,\n\ntasya haste sthitÄ muktis trivargas tu vaÅÄnugaá¸¥.\n\nâÂ KÄlikÄ PurÄá¹a chapter 90 v 28\n\nOne who personally declares âKÄlikÄ, reverence to you.â\n\nhas liberation in his hand, and the other three goals of life at his command.\n\n5. The TÄrÄ Rahasya (a sixteenth century tantric work) makes the statement that all women are forms of KÄlÄ«, and all men are forms of Åiva.18\n\nHow similar, or how different, are the texts I've cited? Certainly it is possible to draw a distinction between a largely narrative work like the DevÄ« MÄhÄtmya, and Tantras which concentrate on meditative and ritual practice. On the other hand, all of the Sanskrit texts just mentioned are from the ÅÄkta tradition (i.e. the Goddess tradition), and all are from texts in which the name KÄlÄ« is applied to the MahÄdevÄ« (Great Goddess) herself. 19\n\nThus, it seems to me that the images and perceptions which so impressed me, when I began to read translations of RÄmprasÄd, did not originate with RÄmprasÄd himself, nor did he have to seek for them outside the KÄlÄ« current in the Goddess tradition. My sense of personal indebtedness to RÄmprasÄd continues, as he was, in any case, the one who introduced me to all this.\n\nIn what sense did RÄmprasÄd rescue KÄlÄ«?\n\nWhat, then, was RÄmprasÄdâs historical importance? Why is it said that he rescued KÄlÄ« from the dacoits and gave her to the bhaktas?\n\nIn sixteenth century Bengal â two centuries before RÄmprasÄd â there was a thriving culture of kÄlÄ«-kula tantra. In that period, KÄlÄ« did not belong only to dacoits: her worship was commended by scholar mystics who wrote in the Sanskrit language about images and rituals. Among these scholars were Ká¹á¹£á¹Änanda ÄgamavÄgÄ«Åa, author of the Tantra-sÄra; BrahmÄnanda Giri, author of the TÄrÄ Rahasya; PÅ«rá¹Änanda, author of the ÅyÄmÄ Rahasya. Their works are classics of the KÄlÄ« tradition, published and read in Bengal to this day. 20\n\nIt is possible, however, that there was a period immediately prior to RÄmprasÄd when the religion of KÄlÄ« was eclipsed by other visions of the divine. There was pressure (as Malcolm McLean notes 21) from Caitanyaâs school of devotion to Ká¹á¹£á¹a. Christianity was another factor. European traders (Portuguese, Danes, Dutch, Greeks, Prussians and Armenians, as well as English) had been a growing presence in Bengal through the seventeenth century.\n\nProbably the most acute challenge to the KÄlÄ« tradition in the pre-RÄmprasÄd period was from the form of Islam represented by Aurangzeb,the last major Mughal emperor. The historian Narendra N. Bhattacharyya notes that Aurangzebâs campaign against Hinduism provoked a movement of âHindu revivalismâ throughout India after the emperorâs death. 22\n\nBhattacharyya mentions as an instance of this Hindu revivalism the royal approval given to KÄlÄ« worship by MahÄrÄja Ká¹á¹£á¹acandra. 23Ká¹á¹£á¹acandra was the ruler of Nadia, a kingdom within the disintegrating Mughal empire. He supported RÄmprasÄdâs work with a grant of tax-free land.24\n\nBhakti, tantrism, or both?\n\nWhat sort of religious culture do RÄmprasÄd and Ká¹á¹£á¹acandra represent? Was it devotionalism (bhakti), as most commentators think, or was it really a form of tantrism, as Malcolm McLean argues? Perhaps it was both at once.\n\nAccording to McLean, it was around the time of RÄmprasÄd that the sixteenth century Tantra-sÄrÄ was translated from Sanskrit into Bengali. The translation appears to have been commissioned by MahÄrÄja Ká¹á¹£á¹acandra. This, as McLean notes, is evidence of the continuing tantric character of KÄlÄ« worship in the eighteenth century.25\n\nYet, the translation of the Tantra-sÄrÄ may also point to parallels between eighteenth century Bengali KÄlÄ« worship and other great Indian bhakti movements.\n\nIt is a characteristic of such a movement that it not only produces new poetic works in the everyday language of its region, but also âtranslations of inaccessible Sanskrit textsâ. I am quoting from A.K. Ramanujanâs discussion of bhakti movements, a discussion which refers specifically to South Indian poetry about devotion to Åiva. Ramanujan compares the bhakti movements to Protestant Christianity, with its vernacular translations of the Bible.26\n\nNarendra Bhattacharyyaâs term ârevivalismâ, which also has Protestant overtones, does seem a better description of RÄmprasÄdâs work than McLeanâs âsynthesisâ. RÄmprasÄd deserves our respect and attention, not because he put together a new picture of the Goddess, but because he gave voice to a major revival of KÄlÄ«-centred religious culture, part of the broader Hindu revival of the eighteenth century.\n\nA question about KÄlÄ«\n\nThe historical issue of RÄmprasÄd â whether his songs represent a synthesis or a revival â is related to a basic issue about the one RÄmprasÄd calls MÄ...\n\nAre we to think of the vision of KÄlÄ« as a relatively modern experience, belonging essentially to the vernacular culture of one region of India; or is it something older, more classical â a treasure for all of India and all the world?\n\nC.R.\n\n(The translations of verses presented in parallel Sanskrit/English and parallel Bengali/English are original to Ferment.)\n\n1 Sinha, J.
