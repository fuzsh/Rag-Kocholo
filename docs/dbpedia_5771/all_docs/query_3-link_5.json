        "text": "Ramprasad Sen\n\nIndian poet-saint\n\nRamprasad Sen (flourished 18th century) was a Shakta poet-saint of Bengal. Not much is known with certainty about his life. Legends abound, however, all of which are meant to highlight Ramprasad’s all-encompassing love for and devotion to the goddess Shakti.\n\nOne such tale concerns the poet’s early career as a clerk for an accountant in a wealthy household in Kolkata. Ramprasad’s obsession with the goddess precluded paying much attention to his work; every day he would sit at his desk and fill his account book with the name of the deity or with a song like this one:\n\nMake me your accounts clerk, O Mother,\n\nI will never betray your trust.\n\n…Let me die at those feet of yours which dispel all misfortunes,\n\nIn that position I will be safe from all dangers.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nAccording to the story, when the master of the household saw this poem, he released Ramprasad from his duties and supplied him with a stipend so that the poet could devote himself fully to service to the goddess. Ramprasad is said to have been later associated with the court of Raja Krishnachandra of Krishnagore and to have composed a work called Bidyasundar, containing both erotic and Tantric elements, under the raja’s patronage.\n\nRamprasad is reputed to have composed some 100,000 songs, some of which became extremely popular among his followers, who regard them as sacred mantras. The goddess Ramprasad portrays is sometimes beautiful, nurturing, and even erotic and at other times grotesque, dangerous, and fickle. Ramprasad contributed to a revival of Shaktism and Tantrism in Bengal and also, in the wake of increased Western presence in India, identified the goddess with Moses and Jesus as well as with the Hindu deities.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
