        "text": "PRESIDENTIAL & VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES:\n\nPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\n\nAURORA RUGERIO\n\nMajors: Environmental Science and Resource Management |Class: Sophomore\n\nHello Dolphins, My name is Aurora Rugerio (she/her), I am a 2nd-year Environmental Science and Resource management student, and I am thrilled to announce that I am running for Student Government President. As an immigrant from México and a first-generation college student, I not only see part of my identity in our student body, but I recognize the importance of continuous efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. In my two years at CI, I’ve been in ASI Student Government as an intern, Lobby Corps member, and director of operations. In these roles, I had the opportunity to advocate for fix financial aid to California state legislators, spread awareness about breaking the stigma behind mental health, empowering STEM female students on campus, encouraging students to use their voice and vote, and most importantly raising awareness about the national hate crimes that have affected our BIPOC (Black Indigenous and People of Color) communities. As your Student Government President, I will continue to empower and advocate for our underrepresented student population. In addition to continuing to work to hold staff, faculty, and students accountable for hateful speech and acts.\n\nVICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE\n\nVAISHNAVI RAMPRASAD\n\nMajor: Health Science | Class: Sophomore\n\nI am absolutely thrilled to run for Student Government Vice President. Currently, I am a second year student majoring in Health Science. From 2015-2019, I worked as a Medical Intern at Westminster Free Clinic, a nonprofit free medical clinic that serves over 8000 patients in the Ventura County area. It was through here that I recognized the significance in serving low-income, uninsured, undocumented, and immigrant families. I chose my major because I have always wanted to serve people, plan to work in healthcare, public policy, and for nonprofits aligned with holistic and preventative care. During my years in CSUCI, I noticed the vitality for social justice, equity, and inclusion. I recognized that many students often go underrepresented and unheard. I further learned about this notion in my current positions as Senator of Social Justice for Student Government and Lobby Corps member for CSSA. I have used my positions as Peer Mentor for the Women of Color Peer Mentoring program and Historian for Empowered Women of Color to help foster my education in diversity, inclusion, activism, and mentorship. As Vice President, I hope to use my abilities and knowledge to further cultivate a more harmonious and inclusive space for all students.\n\nPRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT CANDIDATE PLATFORM:\n\nAdvocate for Student Resources\n\nWe hope to collaborate with the Disability Accommodation and Support Services department on campus to promote accommodation services for students who are in need of them.

In addition, we hope to empower students with disabilities and encourage them to share how important it is to break the stigma behind support services.\n\nWe want to show our support to students who identify as LGBTQ+ by promoting the importance of pronouns.

It is with joy that I announce I am running to be a Senator in ASI Student Government for the upcoming academic year. I am currently a Freshman and First Generation student on the Pre-Nursing Track. I chose Pre-Nursing based on my experience as both a Certified Nursing Assistant and Medical Assistant. I don’t believe there is such a thing as being “too ambitious” because if you love what you do then it will never feel like work. During my First Year at Channel Islands I had the opportunity to establish an organization on campus, which focuses on advancing the resources and opportunities for our Latinx population; I am currently serving on the Student Advisory Board for the Vice President of Student Affairs, where I have advocated to reduce the 15-Unit Requirement for CI Scholarships; I also served as a member of CI’s Lobby Corps, where I advocated for the full funding of the CSUs and to improve college mental health services. If elected to serve as a Senator it will be my priority to focus on student engagement to ensure students receive the most out of their experience at CI by participating in events and initiatives that align with their values and needs.\n\nCANDIDATE PLATFORM:\n\nAdvocacy\n\nReduce the 15-Unit Requirement for CI Scholarships permanently\n\nListen and voice emergent and critical student concerns to the Vice President for Student Affairs Student Advisory Board\n\nPromote and advocate for more resources, scholarships, and career opportunities for Underrepresented Student Initiatives\n\nStudent Engagement\n\nVoice campus Club and Organization concerns to the Vice President for Student Affairs Student Advisory Board\n\nIncrease student engagement amongst incoming students by providing informational guides to help students navigate engagement opportunities\n\nProvide opportunities for Clubs and Organizations to collaborate, attend, and promote each other’s events\n\nEncourage students to get involved on campus in a more direct approach by applying for ASI positions and Student Government positions\n\nPrograms & Academic Support\n\nEncourage incoming students to join and participate in programs that offer mentoring\n\nAdvocate for more scholarship workshops for incoming students and current students\n\nPromote mentoring opportunities for students to apply either as a mentor or mentee\n\nPromote job opportunities in the LRC, STEM Center, and WMC services and academic support\n\nPromote services available for students such as tutoring, workshops, and career development\n\nSTUDENT GOVERNMENT SENATOR AND ASI BOARD DIRECTOR CANDIDATES:\n\nLARRY GARCIA\n\nMajor: Business | Class: Junior\n\nGreetings CI Students!

Throughout my time at CI, I have taken advantage of leadership opportunities in ASI by serving as the treasure and being a member of the ASI Boards subcommittee, the Budget Allocation and Spending Committee. As a candidate I feel that I have matured and improved my skills from my first year in the ASI Board. Covid-19 has impacted our campus drastically and has deteriorated the involvement of students in various clubs and organizations that provide resources and support.

I have been a student at CI for four years where I am majoring in Political Science with a minor in Performing Arts. Like many of my fellow students, I am the first in my family to attend college.

I chose to study Political Science because I intend on enrolling into law school and defend those who cannot fend for themselves in the court of law. If elected, I will advocate for programs that will improve student’s outcomes in the classroom as well as expand basic needs. No one should go hungry in America, especially college students, so it's important to sustain programs that can serve any student’s unmet needs.
