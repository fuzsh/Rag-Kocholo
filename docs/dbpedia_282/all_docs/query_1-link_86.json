        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1945, the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan emerged as a local political party in Azerbaijan. This party called for a kind of local autonomy and had the support of the Soviet Union. The reason for the support of the Soviet Union was to make a pressure to earn the Northern Oil Concession. However, the main purpose of the Russians from obtaining the Northern Oil Concession was to penetrate in the Northern parts of Iran and the Iranian Azerbaijan to prevent the development of the Iranian soil to an imperialist base against the Soviet Union since the leadership of Iran constituted reactionary, rightist, imperialist, anti- Soviet and anti-Communist elites. From Soviet leaders' perspective, although Reza Shah was ousted and exiled (September, 1941), the class composition of the Iranian politicians still constituted the conservative landowner aristocracy and nobility as well as the prime ministers and ministers. In addition, since the early 40s, the pro-USA elite came to power in Iran especially that the Iranian government hired American advisors to rebuild the army, the gendarmerie and the police and to improve its economic and ï¬nancial situation. Thereafter, the inï¬uence of the USA in Iran extremely increased. In addition, the representatives of the Iranian and British oil companies came to Iran and engaged in secret negotiations with the Iranian government to obtain the oil concession of the Southern, Southeastern and Eastern areas of Iran. When it was revealed, the public views and some of the liberal and pro-Soviet parliament representatives protested against it. In response to these negotiations, the Soviet Union sent its representative Sergey Kavtaradze to obtain the Northern Oil Concession, but the Iranian government was not willing to talk about it and Iran's parliament approved a plan to ban the assignment of any oil concessions to foreign companies and governments. This action of the Iranian Parliament with respect to the previous government negotiations with the Western companies was considered to be unfriendly by the Soviet leaders and cause them to be concerned about the security of their shared borders with Iran. This issue as well as the internal factors such as the Azerbaijanis' familiarity with the socialist ideas due to the shared border with the Soviet Union, the national oppression during Reza Shah's monarchy, poverty, the Tudeh party and trade union freedom due to the presence of the Soviet Red Army in the country and ï¬nally, the peasants' ï¬ght against the landowners and feudalists, provided the ground work for the rise of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan.\n\nIn this regard, valuable works have been written by Iranian, Azerbaijani, Russian and American writers. Professor Mikhail Sergovich Ivanov (1966) investigated this issue from the perspective of Sovietism. Ervand Abrahamian, a leading American Iranist dealt with the issue of the role of the internal and external forces in the crisis in his book Iran between Two Revolutions. Jamil Hasanli (2004) examined the documents in the archives of the Soviet Union in this regard. Anvar Khamee and Babak Amir Khosravi (1996), the former members of the Tudeh Party of Iran along with Nosratollah Jahanshahlu, one of the Democratic Party leaders in their memoirs, consider the Azerbaijani Democratic Party as a puppet of the Soviet foreign policy. Touraj Atabaki, the professor of Leiden University in Netherlands, after examining the documents and archives of the Ministry of Foreign Aï¬airs and Ministry of defense of the USA, wrote in his book Azerbaijan in Contemporary Iran that Truman's claim based on sending an ultimatum to Stalin which threat him to use atomic bomb against the Soviet Union is a myth. In this study, the author attempts to comprehensively address the internal and external as well as the objective and subjective causes of the appearance of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. The author tries study the nature of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. He has also tried to investigate the collapse of the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan from a new and modern perspective.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate and analyze the causes of the emergence of the party and its suppression from a new perspective and to provide a comprehensive review using several authentic books and documents. To root the events of Azerbaijan in the 40s that led to the Cold War between the two superpowers, the United States of America (USA) and the Soviet Union, the political and economic situation of the region in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century must be studied.\n\nAzerbaijan resistance\n\nAfter the coup of ftohammad Ali Shah against the Constitution, the people of Azerbaijan led by liberals and intellectuals such as Sattar Khan, Baqer Khan, Haydar Amu Oghli, Karbala'i Ali monsieur, Shaikh Salim and seqat-al-Islam revolted against the Shah. Despite the ten-month siege of the city of Tabriz (the capital of Iranian Azerbaijan) that led to famine, the people did not stop ï¬ghting until the Russian troops under the pretext of delivering food and aid to the Russian, British and European citizens entered Azerbaijan and occupied Tabriz. However, the Gilani revolutionaries and the Iranian Central states tribes could conquer Tehran, remove ftohammad Ali Shah and re-establish the constitutional system.\n\nAtabak park accident and disarmament of the revolutionary armed azerbaijan\n\nWith the success of the Constitutional Revolution, the Russians and the British brought great pressure on the Iranian government to disarm Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan. For this reason, the Central Government decided to invite Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan and Azerbaijani armed forces on the pretext of celebrating the resistance of the people of Azerbaijan to Tehran. These people gathered in Atabak Park of Tehran, but the Central Government gave an ultimatum to them to surrender their weapons within a few days to the Central Government. When Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan refused it, the government forces surrounded them and the Azerbaijani forces were disarmed after the war.\n\nRussia ultimatum and azerbaijan occupation\n\nAfter the revolutionaries' victory over ftohammad Ali Shah, the constitutionalists tried to hire European experts and advisors to organize the economic, ï¬nancial and judicial conditions in Iran. This act jeopardized the interests of the Great Britain and Russia. Especially when ftorgan William Schuster, an American adviser in economic aï¬airs, tried to put an end to the inï¬uence of Russia on Iran's economic and ï¬nancial system by conï¬scating the property of the former King's brother who owed to the Russian bank. This prompted the Russian government to give an ultimatum to expel Schuster. Despite the acceptance of the ultimatum by the government and the dissolution of the parliament, the Russian troops entered Azerbaijan and after defeating the Armed Forces, executed liberalist people like Sheikh Selim, Seqat-al Islam and Karbalayi Ali ftonsieur and six other ones. Moreover, they started looting through their feudal aï¬liates and caused insecurity in Azerbaijan. This indicates that the Atabak Park incident and disarmament of the people of Azerbaijan deprived the Revolution from its natural ally and the revolutionary army and opened the way for the Russian invasion. The Russians remained until the Great October Revolution in Iran when Lenin ordered the return of Russian troops from the northern regions and the Iranian Azerbaijan with the onset of the revolution.\n\nAzerbaijan after the reign of reza shah\n\nOn August 25, 1941 and after Reza Shah's repeated ignorance of the requests from the Great Britain emphasizing the deportation of the German advisors and experts who were considered Nazi Germany and Gestapo spies, Iran was occupied by two neighboring governments and Reza Shah was forced to resign and leave the country.\n\nAt this time, a part of Azerbaijani intellectuals founded the Azerbaijan Association led by ftirza Ali Shabestari. This Association held Turkish theaters and concerts. The organ of this Association was the Newspaper of Azerbaijan that was published both in Turkish and Persian. The Red Army forces also distributed a Turkish-language newspaper called Vatan- Yulanda (in the way of home country) among the people in Tabriz (it was published for the Turkish-speaking soldiers of the Soviet Army).\n\nDemocratic party of azerbaijan\n\nQavam's Coalition Cabinet\n\nIn order to buy time and deceive the democratic forces, Qavam announced that he is ready to invite the progressive parties of the country to form a government. Thus, he invited three members of the Tudeh Party and one member of the Iran Party to his cabinet. However, this cabinet lasted only 75 days. This cabinet collapsed due to the anti-communist revolt of the Southern tribes and the resignation of the Cabinet Ministers who were the members of the Tudeh Party.\n\nResults and findings\n\nWith the defeat of the movement of Azerbaijan, not only was the issue of national oppression in Iran not resolved, but also it got far more complex. On the other hand, a diï¬erent kind of hostility and cynicism was created between Iran and the Soviet Union which continued for nearly 15 years.\n\nAccording to the role of the USA in support of the government of Iran in the Security Council as well as its resistance against the wishes of the Soviet Union, Mohammad Reza Shah was heavily inï¬uenced by the USA and dependent on it. This was the beginning of the process of the full dependence of Iran on the government of the USA. On the other hand, the failure of the movement can be considered as a turning point in the onset of the dictatorship of Mohammad Reza Shah since with the withdrawal of the Red Army from the Iranian territory, the inï¬uence of the USA and the Great Britain on Iran increased and only two years after December 12, 1946, the Tudeh party was illegalized as the pro-Soviet Communist Party. Four years later, following the coup designed by CIA and the overthrow of the government of the national bourgeoisie (1953), Mohammad Reza Shah established his dictatorship in Iran deï¬nitely. But the most important result of this movement was the start of the Cold War and the rivalry between the two superpowers of East and West."
