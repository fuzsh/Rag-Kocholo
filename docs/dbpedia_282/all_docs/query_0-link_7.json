        "text": "The first level of country subdivisions of Iran are the (Persian: استان‌ها; ostānhā) provinces.\n\nEach province is further subdivided into counties called shahrestan (Persian: شهرستان, romanized: shahrestān), and each shahrestan is subdivided into districts called bakhsh (Persian: بخش, romanized: bakhsh). There are usually a few cities (Persian: شهر, romanized: shahr) and rural districts called dehestan (Persian: دهستان, romanized: dehestān) in each county. Rural districts are a collection of a number of villages. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county.\n\nAccording to the government of Iran, as of March 2016 (Iranian calendar 1394), the figures are as follows:\n\nEnglish Persian sing. Persian pl. number Provinces استان ostān استان‌ها ostānhā 31 Counties شهرستان shahrestān 429 Districts بخش bakhsh 1057 cities شهر shahr 1245 rural districts دهستان dehestān 2589\n\nMap of Iran's Provinces\n\nAccording to the Statistical Center of Iran, the figures are as follows, as of March 2016 (end of Iranian calendar 1394):\n\nEnglish Persian sing. Persian pl. number Provinces استان ostān استان‌ها ostānhā 30 Counties شهرستان shahrestān شهرستانها shahrestānhā 429 Districts بخش bakhsh بخشها bakhshhā 1057 cities شهر shahr شهرها shahr hā 1245 rural districts دهستان dehestān دهستانها dehestānhā 2589\n\nTo better understand such subdivisions, the following table may be helpful. Assume that province P is divided into two counties: A and B. County A has 3 districts: Central, X, and Y. The Central district is the district that contains City M, the capital of the county. Each district might contain one or more cities or one or more RDs (rural districts). In our example, the Central district contains City M, City N, and RD T composed of the villages V1, V2, V3, and V4, in turn; district X contains City O and RD U; and district Y has no cities and one RD V. The minimal county consists of only one city as the only district, named Central, which is most common. The county B in the following table is of such type, containing only one city Q.\n\nProvince County District City / RD!Villages P A Central City M (c) City N RD T V1, V2, V3, V4 X City O RD U V5, V6 Y RD V V7, V8, V9 B Central City Q\n\nRelated pages\n\nOstan (Geography)\n\n-stan\n\n-abad\n\nSee also"
