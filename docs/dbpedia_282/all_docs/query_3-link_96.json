        "text": "Roudkhan Castle\n\nRoudkhan Castle is located in Fouman, Gilan Province, and is the largest historical military structure in the region. This castle, with an area of about seven hectares, consists of two sections, Seljuk and Safavid. The foundation of this structure is made of stone materials, while the upper part is made of brick with sarooj mortar. In the past, this fortress housed royal dynasties. In the travelogue of Aleksander Chodźko, mention is made of a stone inscription at the entrance of this building describing the restoration and reconstruction of the castle. This historical building is now one of the tourist attractions in Gilan Province.\n\nLisar Castle\n\nLisar Castle is one of the most historical and beautiful castles in the Gilan Province. Situated in the town of Lisar, it is located 15 kilometers away from the road between Talesh and Astara. The castle covers an area of about 5000 square meters and is constructed using materials such as stone and brick. Lisar Castle is visible from a distance, and one of its notable features, due to being abandoned after a war, is the castle’s dominance over the surrounding environment.\n\nPerched on a hill with an approximate height of 90 meters, this Seljuk-era castle is considered a valuable historical site and is registered on the national heritage list. It is regarded as a local and provincial tourist attraction.\n\nHistorical bridges\n\nGilan, being the rainiest province in Iran, features numerous small and large rivers flowing through its landscape. As the most densely populated area in Iran, there is a substantial demand for constructing multiple bridges to facilitate the movement of people and goods across these rivers. All the bridges in Gilan Province are constructed using mineral materials like brick and sarooj.\n\nGiven the watery environments in which these structures were built, resistance to moisture from the flowing water was a critical factor in ensuring the longevity of these bridges. Additionally, the application of engineering principles in bridge design was crucial. For example, the incorporation of breakwaters in the foundations of historical bridges, providing the highest resistance to fast-flowing waters, has played a key role in preserving the resilience and durability of many of these bridges over time.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to modern bridges made with contemporary materials, which often succumb to floods, highlighting the meticulous craftsmanship and robustness of traditional Iranian architecture evident in the historical bridges of Gilan Province.\n\nIn terms of historical periods, most of these structures are attributed to the Qajar era, with some remnants dating back to the Safavid period, such as the Loshan Bridge positioned at the southern entrance of the province over the Shahroud River.\n\nGilan Province boasts a collection of at least 400 historical bridges, although some have unfortunately succumbed to destruction. Despite the aging beauty of these bridges, Gilan Province stands out as the hub of historical bridges in Iran. Examples include Lahijan’s Brick Bridge, Astaneh Ashrafiyeh Bridge, Chaboksar Bridge, and the composite bridges of Anzali. Over the past forty years, following the victory of the Islamic revolution, one of the tallest bridges in Iran—a 700-meter marvel—was gracefully erected over the Sefidroud river."
