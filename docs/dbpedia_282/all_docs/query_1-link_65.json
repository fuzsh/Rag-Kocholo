        "text": "In spite of Iran's amazing nature and historical sites, you may have no time for museums in Iran. But there are some museums which you can't easily close your eye on them! Tehran has so many to offer, and in other cities, there are incredible museums either. Here are short introductions of the top museums of Iran.\n\n1) Golestan Palace, Tehran\n\nThis UNESCO heritage site is located in the heart of the Grand Bazaar of Tehran and is a must to do in Tehran!

It's too hard to stop staring at their details while you're passing through the graceful garden of this palace. This palace carries different ages, from Safavid to Pahlavi, and initially were enclosed to the walls of Tehran's Arg. But the most important era of this masterpiece is Qajar's which successfully shows the first Western influences on Persian art and architecture.\n\nNote that entrance to Golestan Palace's different halls needs separate tickets, and you'll choose which ones you decide to visit at the entrance to buy its ticket.

Notably, none of the museum's objects has been bought in the museum.\n\nThe collection of this museum includes tools from the stone Age, a copy of the Babylonian code of Hammurabi, a Salt man, and his tools which were buried along with him in a salt mine more than 16 centuries ago.

This treasury is one of the top 10 jewellery museums in the world.

Some of these precious items are brought from India, France, Ottoman, and Italy to Iran by kings or as a nation present. Some have gained in wars as trophies.\n\nThis museum is located downtown, Ferdowsi St., therefore you can plan to see other museums there on the same day.\n\nThe National Jewelry Treasury is a high-security museum, and you can't bring any objects inside.

Water is the first concern for life in dessert. The hidden world of aqueducts lets life spread in the desert. Yazd is well-known for its aqueducts which are even older than Roman ones and still functioning.\n\nThese aqueducts which we call Qanat in Persian have been used for the past 2000 years in Iran to connect the underground water to the city and agricultural fields. The exciting part of this museum is that its location is situated upon a large Qanat.\n\nIn this museum, you can find two qanats which are connected through a stairway called Payab. Qanats had been through many old mansions in Yazd, collecting in pools in basements known as Sardab.\n\nBesides visiting Qanat, you can find old water ownership documents that show how farmers and householders divided water between each other. The most exciting documents and evidence show the way they pinned locations for drinking and fielding water. The museum is also a great collection of various water objects and tools.

The museum founders have been collecting these instruments for 20 years and were two famous Iranian musicians.\n\nThis museum has well-organized halls, and you have the chance to listen to Persian live impromptu music by using Persian instruments. Besides, you learn so much about instruments that you might have never heard of them before.

And actually, carpets are somehow a manifestation of Iranian art. This brilliant record is a result of hardworking hands that have been knotting carpets for more than 7000 years. The Carpet Museum of Iran is the best place to show you the history of carpets and their relations with Iran's culture.\n\nYou will lose hours in a load of different types of Persian carpets, their beautiful patterns, and variation in colours and forms. This impressive collection which is a combination of arts and culture had been woven in different provinces of Iran such as Tabriz, Kashan, Isfahan, and Kerman. The museum was founded in 1977, and in opening time it was intended to be a research centre for carpets.\n\nOn the ground floor of the museum, you will see that carpets are arranged chronologically, beginning with the oldest knotted carpet. But on the first floor, you can find temporary knotted carpets.

At the bottom, there is a small mud gate, which is the entrance to the main museum site.\n\nA strange fear is coming to you, a dark spiritual place underground, full of skeletons with different ancient precious objects. They are buried in different styles along with their ornamentals. The graves are the earliest artefacts to be found in this area, which are 38 graves dating back to 1800 BC.\n\nMost of the corpses found at this site had been dead at an early age. Children had been buried with their toys, women with jewels, and men with their war instruments. The burial manner of putting the corps in the potteries with an amount of food beside them confirms their belief in the second life and resurrection.\n\nIn other words, due to the Mithraism beliefs, the bodies buried before noon posed to the east and the bodies buried in the afternoon posed to the west. But no matter the direction of burial, the corpse's face is always facing north. The other exciting thing about the museum is that the platform hasn't changed. And what you visit is the primary design from thousands of years ago.\n\nYou will experience a different kind of adventure by visiting this ancient museum site in Tabriz, and it is recommended to place it in your itinerary.\n\nAddress: East Azerbaijan Province, Tabriz, Bazar, Emam St, Tabriz Iron Age Museum.
