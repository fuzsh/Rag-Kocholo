        "text": "Iran’s major trading ports—Bushehr and Bandar Abbas—are littoral to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean town of Chahbahar. Chahbahar is becoming more important both as a trans-shipment port for Afghanistan and perhaps as the latest string-of-pearls port for China. Some Iranian trade also travels across the Caspian Sea via the port of Bandar Anzali in the Gilan province.\n\nIn the excerpted article from Etemad, a reformist newspaper published in Tehran, Farhad Dalaghpoosh, the head of the Gilan province’s trade organization, reports an increase in both the volume and value of goods going through the port. Gilan is mountainous, relatively wet, and agricultural, and most of the trade involves agricultural goods and some industrial products like plastics. While the destinations for the trade are logical: Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan all border the Caspian Sea, Dalaghpoosh failed to mention Armenia. Traditionally, and despite their religious differences, Iran and Armenia were close allies because of both cultural links and trade. In the 45-day Nagorno-Karabakh War, which ended 10 November 2020, however, Iran surprised Armenia by closing its border to trade of fuel and other goods, which Armenia hoped to use in its war effort.\n\nIn this context, Dalaghpoosh’s omission of Armenia, but mention of Azerbaijan, might suggest that shifting regional trade in Iran may have foreshadowed geopolitical realignment in the Caucasus and that, Azerbaijan, despite its pro-Western, secular reputation, may actually be growing closer to Iran, its former rival."
