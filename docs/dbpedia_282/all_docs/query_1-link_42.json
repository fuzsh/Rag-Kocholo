        "text": "SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThe Entity List (Supplement No. 4 to Part 744) provides notice to the public that certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to entities identified on the Entity List require a license from BIS and that the availability of license exceptions in such transactions is limited. Entities are placed on the Entity List on the basis of certain sections of part 744 (Control Policy: End-User and End-Use Based) of the EAR.\n\nThe ERC, composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, when appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the Entity List. The ERC makes all decisions to add an entry to the Entity List by majority vote and all decisions to remove or modify an entry by unanimous vote.\n\nERC Entity List decisions\n\nAdditions to the Entity List\n\nThis rule implements the decision of the ERC to add six persons under eight entries to the Entity List on the basis of Section 744.11 (license requirements that apply to entities acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States) of the EAR. The eight entries, two of which are alternate addresses of two of the persons being added to the Entity List, consist of two entries in Iran and six entries in the U.A.E.\n\nThe ERC reviewed Section 744.11(b) (Criteria for revising the Entity List) in making the determination to add these persons to the Entity List. Under that paragraph, persons for which there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the persons have been involved, are involved, or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and those acting on behalf of such persons may be added to the Entity List pursuant to Section 744.11. Paragraphs (b)(1)-(b)(5) of Section 744.11 include an illustrative list of activities that could be contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.\n\nThe six persons being added to the Entity List under this rule have been determined by the ERC to be involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Two of the persons being added to the Entity List under this rule, Seyed Mahdi Mousavi (“Mousavi”) and his company, Seyed Mousavi Trading, are located in the U.A.E. and in Iran. BIS's investigation of Mousavi and his company, Seyed Mousavi Trading, indicates that he, individually, and by and through his company, knowingly acquired U.S.-origin items for transshipment to Iran through the U.A.E. and Hong Kong. Further, the investigation indicates that the shipments to Iran included shipments to a person on the Denied Persons List (see section 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR). Therefore, pursuant to Section 744.11(b)(5) of the EAR, the ERC determined that Mousavi and Seyed Mousavi Trading are knowingly and willfully engaging in the transshipment of U.S.-origin equipment subject to the EAR, without the required Department of Commerce or Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licenses, for use in Iran in violation of the embargo against Iran as specified in the Iranian Transactions Regulations (31 CFR Part 560). Iran has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (b) of Supplement No. 1 to Part 764 of the EAR, no person may, directly or indirectly, export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to or on behalf of a denied person.\n\nThe other four persons being added to the Entity List under this rule, Fajr Almadeena Electronics (FAE) and its owners, Alex Nouri Zadeh, Mohammad Nayeb, and Jamal Hasan are all located in the U.A.E. BIS's investigation indicates that FAE was listed as a recipient of hundreds of U.S.-origin items. Although FAE claims that the items it receives remain in the U.A.E. and that it is the end-user of record, FAE principals have not been able to provide information on the items' current location or end-use. Moreover, BIS's investigation indicates that FAE's office space is inappropriate for end-use in situ of the items shipped. Therefore, pursuant to Section 744.11(b)(4) and (b)(5) of the EAR, the ERC determined that FAE, Alex Nouri Zadeh, Mohammad Nayeb, and Jamal Hasan are unreliable recipients of U.S.-origin items and may be diverting such items through the U.A.E. to Iran, without the required Department of Commerce or OFAC export licenses, for use in Iran in violation of the embargo against Iran as specified in the Iranian Transactions Regulations (31 CFR Part 560). As noted above, Iran has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\n\nFor all eight entries for the six persons being added to the Entity List, the ERC specified a license requirement for all items subject to the EAR and established a license application review policy of a presumption of denial. The license requirement applies to any transaction in which items are to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to such persons or in which such persons act as purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, or end-user. In addition, no license exceptions are available for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to those persons being added to the Entity List.\n\nThis final rule adds the following six persons under eight entries to the Entity List:\n\nIran\n\n(1) Seyed Mahdi Mousavi, BLK 6, No. 12 Beside Gilan Street, Rodstar Street, Under Hafez Bridge, Tehran, Iran; and No. 10-6th Floor Iranian Trade Center, Valiasr Square, Tehran, Iran (See alternate addresses under U.A.E.); and\n\n(2) Seyed Mousavi Trading, a.k.a., the following two aliases:\n\n—Hitech Computer Peripherals; and\n\n—Hitech Corporation.\n\nBLK 6, No. 12 Beside Gilan Street, Rodstar Street, Under Hafez Bridge, Tehran, Iran; and No. 10-6th Floor Iranian Trade Center, Valiasr Square, Tehran, Iran (See alternate addresses under U.A.E.).\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n(1) Alex Nouri Zadeh, a.k.a. the following three aliases:\n\n—Alex Banai;\n\n—Alex Norry; and\n\n—Nouri Zadeh,\n\nNo. 102 and 106, 1st Floor, K5 Entrance, Alshami Rest. Bldg., Al Muraqqabat Rd., Deira, Dubai, 184609 U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 184607, Dubai, U.A.E.;\n\n(2) Fajr Almadeena Electronics, No. 102 and 106, 1st Floor, K5 Entrance, Alshami Rest. Bldg., Al Muraqqabat Rd., Deira, Dubai, 184609 U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 184607, Dubai, U.A.E.\n\n(3) Jamal Hasan, a.k.a. the following alias:\n\n—Jamal Haji,\n\nNo. 102 and 106, 1st Floor, K5 Entrance, Alshami Rest. Bldg., Al Muraqqabat Rd., Deira, Dubai, 184609 U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 184607, Dubai, U.A.E.\n\n(4) Mohammad Nayeb, No. 102 and 106, 1st Floor, K5 Entrance, Alshami Rest. Bldg., Al Muraqqabat Rd., Deira, Dubai, 184609 U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 184607, Dubai, U.A.E.\n\n(5) Seyed Mahdi Mousavi, P.O. Box 49465, Dubai, U.A.E.; and, P.O. Box 7941, Dubai, U.A.E. (See alternate addresses under Iran); and\n\n(6) Seyed Mousavi Trading, a.k.a., the following two aliases:\n\n—Hitech Computer Peripherals; and\n\n—Hitech Corporation.\n\nP.O. Box 49465, Dubai, U.A.E.; and P.O. Box 7941, Dubai, U.A.E (See alternate addresses under Iran).\n\nRemoval From the Entity List\n\nThis rule implements a decision of the ERC to remove one person, Raaziq International (Pvt.) Ltd., located in Pakistan, from the Entity List as a result of the person's request for removal from the Entity List. Based upon the review of the information provided in the removal request in accordance with section 744.16 (Procedure for requesting removal or modification of an Entity List entity), and after review by the ERC's member agencies, the ERC determined that this person should be removed from the Entity List.\n\nThe ERC decision to remove this person took into account this person's cooperation with the U.S. Government, as well as this person's assurances of future compliance with the EAR. In accordance with section 744.16(c), the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration has sent written notification to this person, informing this entity of the ERC's decision to remove it from the Entity List. This final rule implements the decision to remove the following person located in Pakistan from the Entity List:\n\nPakistan\n\n(1) Raaziq International (Pvt.) Ltd., House Number 32, F-2, Khusal Khan Khattak Road, University Town, Peshawar, Pakistan.\n\nAnnual Review of the Entity List\n\nThis rule also amends the Entity List on the basis of the annual review of the Entity List conducted by the ERC, in accordance with the procedures outlined in Supplement No. 5 to part 744 (Procedures for End-User Review Committee Entity List Decisions). The changes from the annual review of the Entity List that are approved by the ERC are implemented in stages as the ERC completes its review of entities listed under different destinations on the Entity List. This rule implements the results of the annual review for entities located in Belarus, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore and South Africa. The entities located in Canada, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Lebanon, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom were also reviewed by the ERC, but no additional changes are being made to those entries as a result of the annual review of the Entity List.\n\n1. Removals From the Entity List on the Basis of Annual Reviews\n\nThis rule removes fourteen entries from the Entity List on the basis of the annual review of the Entity List. The persons removed were determined to no longer meet the criteria for inclusion on the Entity List. Specifically, this rule implements the decision of the ERC to remove one person located in China, three persons located in Egypt, eight persons located in Hong Kong, and two persons located in Kuwait, as follows:\n\nChina\n\n(1) Tracy Little, Room 1104, North Tower Yueziu City Plaza, No. 445 Dong Feng Zhong Rd., Guangzhou, China.\n\nEgypt\n\n(1) H Logic, Behind 14 Mahmoud Sedky St., El Ekbal, Alexandria, Egypt; and 11 Abd El-Hamid Shoman St., Nasser City, Cairo;\n\n(2) Hesham Yehia, Behind 14 Mahmoud Sedky St., El Ekbal, Alexandria, Egypt; and\n\n(3) Najeeb Al Awadhi, 14 Mahmoud Sedky St., El Ekbal, Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nHong Kong\n\n(1) Amy So, Room 1701, New Commerce Centre, 19 On Sum St., Siu Lek Yuen, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong;\n\n(2) Frank Lam, 1206-7, 12/F New Victory House, Hong Kong;\n\n(3) Gary Chan, 4/F, Chinabest International Centre, 8 Kwai On Rd., Kwai Chung, N.T., Hong Kong;\n\n(4) Green Channel Electronics Company, Unit 902, Ricky Center, 36 Chong Yip St., Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong;\n\n(5) Techlink Electronics, Unit 5, 18/F, Laurels Industrial Centre, 32 Tai Yau St., San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong;\n\n(6) TLG Electronics, Room 1701, New Commerce Centre, 19 On Sum St., Siu Lek Yuen, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong;\n\n(7) Unite Chance Technology Company, Workshop A14, 5/F, Block A Sheung Shui Plaza, 3 Ka Fu Close Sheung Shui, N.T., Hong Kong; and\n\n(8) Wing Shing Computer Components Company (H.K.) Ltd., Unit E, 9/F, Lladro Centre, 72 Hoi Yuen Rd., Kwon Tong, Kin, Hong Kong.\n\nKuwait\n\n(1) Advanced Technology General Trading Company, Hawalli, Bin Khaldoun St., Fadhalah Complex, Mizzanin, Office #4, P.O. Box 22682, Safat, 13087, Kuwait. (See alternate address under U.A.E.); and\n\n(2) Abubakr Abuelazm, Hawalli, Bin Khaldoun St., Fadhalah Complex, Mizzanin, Office #4, P.O. Box 22682, Safat, 13087, Kuwait (See alternate address under U.A.E.).\n\nThe two entities removed from Kuwait are also listed in the U.A.E.; BIS is not removing the two U.A.E. listings from the Entity List at this time. The ERC will evaluate those entries as part of the annual review of the entities located in the U.A.E. The removal of the above-referenced fourteen entities on the basis of annual review of the Entity List, and the removal of the one entity referenced above on the basis of a Section 744.16 removal request that was approved by the ERC, eliminates the existing license requirements in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 for exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) to these fifteen entities. However, the removal of these fifteen entities from the Entity List does not relieve persons of other obligations under part 744 of the EAR or under other parts of the EAR. Neither the removal of an entity from the Entity List nor the removal of Entity List-based license requirements relieves persons of their obligations under General Prohibition 5 in section 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR which provides that, “you may not, without a license, knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user or end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.” Additionally these removals do not relieve persons of their obligation to apply for export, reexport or in-country transfer licenses required by other provisions of the EAR. BIS strongly urges the use of Supplement No. 3 to part 732 of the EAR, “BIS's `Know Your Customer' Guidance and Red Flags,” when persons are involved in transactions that are subject to the EAR.\n\n2. Modifications to the Entity List on the Basis of the Annual Review\n\nOn the basis of decisions made by the ERC during the annual review, in addition to the removals described above, this rule amends thirty-six entries currently on the Entity List. The amended entries consist of three entries under Belarus, twelve entries under China, three entries under Malaysia, twelve entries under Pakistan, one entry under Singapore, and five entries under South Africa. The amendments clarify the relationship between listed persons and/or provide alternate addresses, alternate spellings and acronyms and/or aliases for the names of the listed persons, as follows:\n\nBelarus\n\n(1) Belmicrosystems Research and Design Center, Office 313, 12 Korzhenevsky Street, 20108 Minsk, Republic of Belarus; and Korjenevsky Str., 12, Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus; and 12, Korzhenevskogo Str., Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus;\n\n(2) SOE Semiconductor Devices Factory, Office 313, 12 Korzhenevsky Street, 20108 Minsk, Republic of Belarus; and Korjenevsky Str., 12, Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus; and 12, Korzhenevskogo Str., Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus; and\n\n(3) Vasili Kuntsevich, Office 313, 12 Korzhenevsky Street, 20108 Minsk, Republic of Belarus; and Korjenevsky Str., 12, Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus; and 12, Korzhenevskogo Str., Minsk, 220108, Republic of Belarus.\n\nChina\n\n(1) 33 Institute, a.k.a., the following three aliases:\n\n—Beijing Automation Control Equipment Institute (BACEI);\n\n—Beijing Institute of Automatic Control Equipment, China Haiying Electromechanical Technology Academy; and\n\n—No. 33 Research Institute of the Third Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASIC).\n\nYungang, Fengtai District, Beijing;\n\n(2) 35 Institute, a.k.a., the following four aliases:\n\n—Beijing Hangxing Machine Building Corporation;\n\n—Beijing Huahang Radio Measurements Research Institute, China Haiying Electronic Mechanical Technical Research Academy;\n\n—Huahang Institute of Radio Measurement; and\n\n—No. 35 Research Institute of the Third Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASIC);\n\n(3) 54th Research Institute of China, a.k.a., the following three aliases:\n\n—China Electronics Technology Group Corp.

Additions to the Entity List\n\nOn the basis of decisions made by the ERC during the annual review of the Entity List, in addition to the removals and modifications described above, this rule adds two separate entries under China for two entities formerly listed on the Entity List under China as aliases of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics: Sichuan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Also on the basis of decisions made by the ERC during the annual review of the Entity List, this rule adds one entry under Uganda, UCB Arcade, as an alternate address for Allied Trading Co., an entity listed on the Entity List under Pakistan, therefore creating a new country listing on the Entity List. The ERC determined that the licensing requirements and licensing review policies for all three of these entries should mirror those in entries in which they were previously located. Therefore, for the entries for Sichuan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, the specified license requirement is all items subject to the EAR and the established license review policy is case-by-case basis. For UCB Arcade, the specified license requirement is all items subject to the EAR and the established license review policy is presumption of denial. The three additions to the Entity List as a result of the annual review are as follows:\n\nChina\n\n(1) Sichuan University, No. 24 South Section 1, Yihuan Road, Chengdu, China, 610065; and No. 29 Jiuyanqiao Wangjiang Road, Chengdu, China, 610064; and People's South Road, Chengdu, China, 610041; and Shuangliu County, Chuanda Road, Chengdu, China, 610207; and\n\n(2) University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No. 4, 2nd Section, North Jianshe Road, Chengdu, 610054.\n\nUganda\n\n(1) UCB Arcade, a.k.a., the following alias:\n\n—Allied Trading Co., P.O. Box 5999, Kampala, Uganda (See alternate address under Allied Trading Co. in Pakistan).\n\nSavings Clause\n\nShipments of items removed from eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR) as a result of this regulatory action that were en route aboard a carrier to a port of export or reexport, on [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION], pursuant to actual orders for export or reexport to a foreign destination, may proceed to that destination under the previous eligibility for a License Exception or export or reexport without a license (NLR).\n\nAlthough the Export Administration Act expired on August 20, 2001, the President, through Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783 (2002), as extended by the Notice of August 15, 2012, 77 FR 49699 (August 16, 2012), has continued the Export Administration Regulations in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. BIS continues to carry out the provisions of the Export Administration Act, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, pursuant to Executive Order 13222.\n\nRulemaking Requirements\n\n1. Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to nor be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This regulation involves collections previously approved by the OMB under control numbers 0694-0088, “Multi-Purpose Application,” which carries a burden hour estimate of 43.8 minutes for a manual or electronic submission. Total burden hours associated with the PRA and OMB control number 0694-0088 are not expected to increase as a result of this rule. You may send comments regarding the collection of information associated with this rule, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Jasmeet K. Seehra, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by email to Jasmeet_K._Seehra@omb.eop.gov, or by fax to (202) 395-7285.\n\n3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined in Executive Order 13132.\n\n4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment and a delay in effective date are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. (See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1)). BIS implements this rule to protect U.S. national security or foreign policy interests by preventing items from being exported, reexported, or transferred (in country) to the persons being added to the Entity List. If this rule were delayed to allow for notice and comment and a delay in effective date, then entities being added to the Entity List by this action would continue to be able to receive items without a license and to conduct activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. In addition, because these parties may receive notice of the U.S. Government's intention to place these entities on the Entity List once a final rule was published it would create an incentive for these persons to either accelerate receiving items subject to the EAR to conduct activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and/or to take steps to set up additional aliases, change addresses, and take other steps to try to limit the impact of the listing on the Entity List once a final rule was published. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or by any other law, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., are not applicable.\n\nAccordingly, part 744 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730-774) is amended as follows:\n\n1. The authority citation for 15 CFR part 744 is amended to read as follows:\n\nAuthority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.;50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.;22 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.;42 U.S.C. 2139a; 22 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.;22 U.S.C. 7210; E.O. 12058, 43 FR 20947, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 179; E.O. 12851, 58 FR 33181, 3 CFR, 1993 Comp., p. 608; E.O. 12938, 59 FR 59099, 3 CFR, 1994 Comp., p. 950; E.O. 12947, 60 FR 5079, 3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 356; E.O. 13026, 61 FR 58767, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 228; E.O. 13099, 63 FR 45167, 3 CFR, 1998 Comp., p. 208; E.O. 13222, 66 FR 44025, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 783; E.O. 13224, 66 FR 49079, 3 CFR, 2001 Comp., p. 786; Notice of September 21, 2011, 76 FR 59001 (September, 22, 2011); Notice of November 9, 2011, 76 FR 70319 (November 10, 2011); Notice of January 19, 2012, 77 FR 3067 (January 20, 2012); Notice of August 15, 2012, 77 FR 49699 (August 16, 2012).\n\n2.
