It hath, toward the south and south-west side, the mountain of Demawend ; and on the north-east side, towards the province of Masanderan [=Mazandaran], the mountain of Jeilak-Perjan. The author of the French book, entitled Les Estats & Empires, puts it in the province of Chuaressen [=Khurasan]: but he is mistaken, for Khurasan is a province of the Usbeques, Tartars, at 43. degrees latitude, and lies at a great distance from that of Iraq.\n\nIf you take in all its suburbs it will be found that it is above eight German leagues in compass, in so much that it is as much as a man can do to go about it in one day. The city hath twelve gates, whereof there are but nine open; above eighteen thousand houses, and about five-hundred thousand inhabitants. The walls of it are earth, low and weak, being below two fathoms, and above but a foot thick, and its bastions are of brick but so poorly flanked that they do not anyway fortify the city, no more than does the ditch which is so ruined that both summer and winter a man may pass over it dry-foot. F. Bizarro, and some others affirm that the walls are of chalk; but I could find no such thing, unless it were that in the castle, which hath its walls distinct from those of the city, there are some places which look as if they were whitened or done over with chalk or lime.\n\nThe Allahverdi-khan Bridge\n\nSource: Sanson\n\nThe river Sendurat [=Zayanda-rud] which rises out of the adjacent mountain Demawend runs by its walls on the south and south-west side, on which side is the suburbs of Tzulfa [=Julfa]. Before it comes into the city it is divided into two branches, one whereof falls in the park called Hasartzebib [=Hazarjarib], where the king keeps all sorts of deer, and from the other there is drawn a current of water which passes by channels under ground into the garden of Tzarabagh [=Charar Bagh]. This river supplies the whole city with water, there being hardly a house into which it comes not by pipes, or so near, as that it is no great trouble to them to fill their cisterns of it, which they call haws and burke; though besides this convenience of the river they have wells, the water whereof is as good as that of the river. Allawerdi-Chan , sometime governor of Shiras [=Shiraz], built at his own charge the fair stone bridge which is between the garden of Charar Bagh and the city upon this river, which is as broad in that place as the Thames is at London.\n\nShah Abbas [r. 1588-1629] had a design to bring into the river of Zayanda-rud that of Abkures [=Kuhrang] which rises on the other side of the same mountain of Demawend; and whereas to bring these two rivers into the same channel there was a necessity of cutting the mountain, he employed, for the space of fourteen years together, above a thousand pioneers at that work. And though they met with extraordinary difficulties, not only in that they had to do with pure rock which in some places was above two hundred foot deep, but also in regard the mountain being covered with snow for near nine months of the year; they had but three to work in, yet had he the work constantly carried on with such earnestness, that all the khans and great lords sending their work-men thereto, upon their own charges, there was in a manner no doubt made of the success of that great enterprise, since there remained to do but the space of two hundred paces when Shah Abbas died, leaving the consummation of the imperfect work to his successor, who hath as yet done nothing therein.\n\nIf Ali, the patron and great saint of the Persians, had lived in that time he might have done Shah Abbas a very great kindness by opening that rock at one blow with his sword and so made way for the river, as he sometime did, according to the relations of the Persians, in the Province of Karabach [=Qarabagh], where he made a passage for the river Aras through the mountain which he opened with his sword and which upon that occasion is to this day called Ali eressi, that is, the Straights of Ali.\n\nThe city of Isfahan was twice destroyed by Tamerlane; once, when he took it from the king of Persia; and the other when the said city would have revolted from him, and become subject to its lawful Prince. Jos. Barbaro, who traveled into Persia in the year 1471 says that about twenty years before, Chotza, who he calls Giausa, King of Persia, desirous to punish this city for its rebellion, commanded his soldiers not to come thence, unless they brought with them the heads of some of the inhabitants of Isfahan; and that the soldiers, who met not every day with men, cut off womens heads, shaved them, and so brought them to Chotza, and that by this means the city was so depopulated that there were not people enough left to fill the sixth part of it. It began to recover itself under Shah Ismael II [r. 1576-77] but indeed it was Shah Abbas by translating the seat of his empire from Caswin [=Kazvin] to this city, brought it to the height it is now in, not only by adorning it with many fair, both public and private structures, but also by peopling it with a great number of families which he brought along with him out of several other provinces of the kingdom.\n\nBut what contributes most to the greatness of this city is the metschids, or mosques, the market places, the bazaars, the public baths and the palaces of great lords that have some relation to the court; but especially the fair gardens, whereof there is so great a number that there are many houses have two of three and hardly an but hath at least one.\n\nThe expenses the Persians are at in their gardens is that wherein they make greatest ostentation of their wealth. Not that they much mind the furnishing of them with delightful flowers as we do in Europe; but these they slight as an excessive liberality of nature, by whom their common fields are strewed with an infinite number of tulips and other flowers; but they are rather desirous to have their gardens full of all sorts of fruit trees and especially to dispose them into pleasant walks, of a kind of place or poplar, a tree not known in Europe, which the Persians call tzinnar. These trees grow up to the height of the pine and have very broad leaves, not much unlike those of the vine. Their fruit hath some resemblance to the chestnut while the outer coat is about it; but there is no kernel within it so that it is not to be eaten. The wood thereof is very brown and full of veins, and the Persians use it in doors and shutters for windows, which being rubbed with oil look incomparably better that anything made of wall-nut tree, nay indeed than the root of it which is now so much esteemed.\n\nAll things in their gardens are very delightful but above all their fountains. The basins, or receptacles, of them are very large and most of marble or free-stone. There are belonging to them many channels of the same stone which convey the water from one basin to the another and serve to water the garden. Persons of quality, nay indeed many rich merchants, build in their gardens summer houses or a kind of gallery or hall which is enclosed with a row of pillars whereto they add at the four corners of the main structure so many withdrawing rooms, or pavilions where they take the air, according to the wind then reigning. And this they take so much delight in, that many time these summer houses are handsomer built and better furnished than those wherein they ordinarily live. Tis true, their great-mens houses and palaces are very magnificent within; but there is not anything so ugly without in regard most of their houses are built only of earth or brick baked in the sun.\n\nTheir houses are in a manner square and most have four stories, accounting the ground-room for one. They call the cellar, and such places belonging to a house as are under ground, sirsemin; the ground-rooms of the house, chane; the first story, kuschk; the second, tzauffe; and the third, kesser; and they call the open halls, eiwan. Their windows are commonly as big as their doors, and in regard their buildings are not very high; the frames ordinarily reach up to the roof. They have not yet the use of glass, but in winter they cover the frames of their windows, which are made like lattices, with oiled paper.\n\nThere is also little wood in Persia, I mean in most of its provinces that not being able to keep any great fire they make use of stoves, but they are otherwise made than those of Germany. In the midst of their low-rooms they make a hole in the ground of about the compass of an ordinary kettle which they fill with burning coals or charcoal, and put over it a plank or little low table covered with a large carpet. Sitting according to their custom, upon the ground, they thrust their feet under the table and draw the carpet over their body up to the breast so as that the heat is thereby kept in. Some may pass away the night also thus accommodated and so they procure a very natural heat with little fire, and they imagine it to be the more wholesome in that it troubles not the head, which in the mean time hath the benefit of a fresh and healthy air. They call [these] kind of stoves, tenuer, and that the brain might not be offended by vapors, which charcoal commonly sends up into the head, they have certain passages and conduits under ground through which the air draws them away. Persons of mean quality, and such as are saving, dress their meat with these tenuers and make use of them instead of an oven, and bake bread and cakes over them. There is not a house in Isfahan but hath its court which a man must cross ere he comes into the house.\n\nThey say that heretofore, the streets of Isfahan were so broad that twenty horse might have rid a-breast in any of them. But now, especially since the city began to be repeopled in the time of Shah Abbas, they husbanded their ground better, especially in the heart of the city near the Maidan [=Maydan] and the bazaar, insomuch that the streets are become so narrow that if a man meets a mule-driver, whom they call charbende, that is, a servant to look to the asses, who many times drives twenty or more before him, he must step into some shop and stay there till they be all passed by. All the streets abutting upon the Maydan are very narrow, but the Maydan, or marketplace, though it hath shops all about it, is so large that I cannot imagine there is any in Europe comes near it.\n\nThis marketplace is seven hundred foot long, and two-hundred and fifty broad . All the houses about the Maydan are of equal height and all built of brick having their shops vaulted: where you have on the side towards the kings palace: goldsmiths, lapidaries, and druggists; and opposite to them, those merchants who see all sorts of stuffs of silk, wool, and cotton, and the taverns where they tipple and sell all sorts of provisions. All these houses are two stories high and have all their eiwans, or open halls. The market-place is planted all about with a kind of trees, called scimscad, which is somewhat like box, but they are much higher and the branches being perpetually green they are so cut that the shops are to be seen between the trees and make a very delightful prospect. But it is not one of the least ornaments of their Maydan that [of] the rivulet, which runs at the foot of these trees in a channel of free stone, raised two foot from the ground all about the market-place.\n\nTradesmen do not work at all themselves, but have their slaves and apprentices who do all the main work at their houses, while the masters business is only to sell his commodities in shops appointed for that purpose at the Maydan in a great vaulted gallery built with arches, or in the streets abutting upon it where every trade hath its particular quarter assigned it, or haply in a street appointed for that particular commodity and where they permit not the selling of any other. The observance of which order, in regard the Persians are very neat in all they do, makes so delightful a show that I have not seen anything like it. At the end of this gallery there are two balconies covered over head opposite one to the other where their music, which consists in timbrels, hawboys [?], and other kind of instruments which they call kerenei, is to be heard every night at sunset, as also when the king, either going out of the city or coming into it, passes through the Maydan. They have this kind of music in all the cities of Persia which are governed by a khan and they say Tamerlane first introduced that custom which hath been observed ever since.\n\nThe kings palace is upon the Maydan. The Persians call it Dowlet-Chane or Der Chane Schach and there lie before the gate several great pieces [i.e., canons] of all sizes, but most such as require 36 or 48 pound bullet, very rough cast, without carriages and lying upon beams so as that no use can be made of them. Nicholas Hem, a Hollander who traveled into Persia in the years 1623 and 1624, says that these pieces were brought thither from Ormus, and that they secure the avenues of the place; but as I said before it is impossible they should be discharged. Nay, the palace itself hath no fortifications and is compassed only by a high wall. In the day time there are but three or four upon the guard and in the night there are fifteen at the gate, and about thirty within the kings apartment. These last are all persons of quality and sons of khans of whom some stand sentry, and the rest walk the round, and they all lie upon the ground in the open air. This guard hath its kischiktzi, or particular captain, who every night delivers the king a list of their names who are upon the guard, that he may know whom he may confide in and by what persons he is served.\n\nOver the first gate there is a great square structure which hath large windows on all sides, and we were told that within it was carved all over and gilt. The other principal apartments of this great palace are the tab chane, which is a spacious hall where the king treats all the great lords of his court and entertains them at dinner upon the day of their Naurus, which is the first day of their year; the divan chane which is the ordinary place where all appeals are tried and where the king commonly gives audience to the ambassadors of foreign princes, as we said elsewhere, which is done, partly upon this accompt, that this edifice having a great court adjoining to it, into which it looks, the king may have the convenience of showing the ambassadors some of his best horses and his other pieces of magnificence as he did at our first audience. The haram chane which is a hall wherein the cassaha [=khassa], that is the kings concubines, who are always shut up in several apartments, have their meetings to dance before him and to divert him with their musicians who are all eunuchs; the deka, or the place of the kings ordinary residence where he lodges and eats with his lawful wives. All these halls have belonging to them several chambers, closets, galleries, and other necessary apartments for the lodging and divertissement of so powerful a prince and so great a number of ladies who are all with him within the same palace, wherein there is not any considerable apartment but hath its particular garden.\n\nThe Palace Gate\n\nSource: Sanson\n\nAt the entrance of the Kings palace, and about forty paces from the outer gate, on the right hand side there is another gate which gives a privilege to the whole place and makes the sanctuary we spoke of before, called by the Persians Alla-Capi [=Ali Qapu, or Sublime Porte], that is, Gods gate. All those who stand in fear of imprisonment, whether upon a civil or criminal accompt, find here an assured sanctuary and refuge, even against the kings displeasure, and may live there till they are reconciled to their adversaries, if they have to do with private men, or obtained their pardon of the king, provided they have wherewithal to submit. Murderers and assassins participate of the same privilege; but the Persians have so great an aversion for theft, as accounting it a base and infamous crime, as it really is, that they permit not thieves, if they do come in, to stay there many days. At the time of our travels, we found in this sanctuary a sultan who having either through misfortune or his own ill conduct lost the kings favor, and being in fear of losing his life, was got in thither with all his family and lived in tents which he had set up in the garden.\n\nBehind the kings palace lies the castle, which they call Taberik Kale. It serves for a citadel, which is the signification of the word kale, and it is fortified with a rampier and several bastions of earth, which being very sharp above, Nicholas Hem (whom I have found in all things else the most exact of any that have written of the city of Isfahan) took them for towers. The king does not live in it, but there is a governor who hath the command of it, and a strong garrison within it which is kept there for the security of the treasure, the arms, and ammunition of war, that are within it, though all the artillery consists only in some field-pieces.\n\nOn the other side of the Maydan, in a by-street, there is another sanctuary which is called Tschehil Sutun [=Chihil Sutun], upon occasion of the forty beams which prop the roof of the structure, and which all rest upon one pillar, which stands in the middle of the metschid, or mosque. Into this sanctuary there got a great number of the inhabitants of Isfahan when Tamerlane punished the rebellion of this city. For though he had no great sentiments of piety, yet did he discover a certain respect for the places he accounted sacred; and accordingly he spared all those who took refuge in the mosque, but ordered all the rest to be cut up in pieces and commanded the walls of the court belonging to it to be pulled down. But Shah Ishmael had them built up again, and made the place a sanctuary.\n\nTowards the south part of the Maydan stands that rich and magnificent mosque which Shah Abbas began and was almost finished when he died: but Shah Safi had the work carried on at the time of our being there, causing the walls to be done over with marble. It is dedicated to Mededi, who is the twelfth Imam, or saint, of the posterity of Ali, for whom Shah Abbas had so particular a devotion that he was pleased to build several other mosques after the same model (though much less) at Tauris and other places, in honor of the same saint, wherein he made use of the marble which he had brought from Eruan, which is as white as chalk, and smoother than any looking glass. But the marble which was spent in the building of the great meschid at Isfahan, is brought from the mountain of Elwend. The Persians would have it believed that Mehedi is not dead but lies hid in a grot, near Kufa, and that he shall come out thence, some time before the day of judgement, and ride Duldul, Alis horse, upon whom he is to go all over the world to convert people to the religion of Muhammad. Whence this mosque is called Metzid Mehedi Sahebeseman.\n\nTo go from the Maydan to this mosque, a man must pass through a great court paved with free-stone at the end where there is, under a tree, a fair cistern wherein those who go to do their devotions in the mosque wash and purify themselves. Behind this tree there is a pair of stairs by which you go up to the square place, which is much less than the fore-said court, and thence there is it is but a little further to the mosque. John de Laet , taking it from Nicholas Hem, affirms that there is a pair of stairs of thirteen steps to get up to the mosque and that those stairs are cut out of one pierce of marble; but there is no such thing. The portal is of white marble, and at least as high as that of the Meschaick Chodabende in Sulthania. The door is covered all over with plates of silver which are gilt in several places.\n\nAs you pass through the door you enter into a great court round about which there is a vaulted gallery and in the middle of it a great cistern of free-store built eight square and full of water. Above this gallery there is another, not so high as this, which upper gallery hath, towards the hejat, or court, a row of marble pillars, which in some places are gilt. A man must cross this court to go into the mosque wherein are the mederab and the cathib, that is, the altar and the pulpit, according to their way. As you come in you pass under a vault of extraordinary height, done over with glittering stones some blue, some gilt. It is a vast structure having many niches and chapels which are all upheld by marble pillars. But the most remarkable thing in all this emerat, is that all the walls, as well those of the gallery, which is in the court, as of the mosque itself, are of marble, (which is most of in white and extremely well polished) but is five or six foot in length and breadth, and they are so neatly put one into the other, that, the junctures being in a manner imperceptible, a man cannot but admire the art of the workman and acknowledge that the workmanship is not to be imitated. The meherab, or the alter, is all of one piece of marble having on each side a pillar of the same stone, which is also all of one piece. Besides this mosque, which is the chiefest in all the city and the most sumptuous of any in the whole kingdom, there are in Isfahan many others, but they are much less and there is a too great a number of them for us to undertake to give here a more particular description thereof.\n\nIn the midst of the Maydan there stands a high pole, much after the manner of those that are set up in several cities of Europe, to shoot at the parrot, but, instead of a bird, they set on top of it a little melon, an arpus, or an apple, or haply a trencher with money upon it; and they always shoot at it on horseback and that riding in full speed.\n\nThe king himself is sometimes pleased to make one, among the inhabitants, when they are at that sport, or sends some of his chiefest lords to do it; and commonly there are very considerable sums laid. The money which falls down with the trencher belongs to the kings foot-men and he who carries away the prize is obliged to make a feast for all the company; nay for the king himself if so be he hath shot among them. They play there also at a certain game, which the Persians call Kuitskaukan, which is a kind of mall or cricket; but they play at this also on horse-back and strike the bowl to the end riding in full speed. They also often exercise themselves at the tzirid, or javelin; there we have described elsewhere. And in regard the Persians hath the best horses in the world, and that the Persians are very curious about them, they many times lay wagers on their swiftness, and ride them between the two pillars which are at both ends of the Maydan. When the king is only a spectator of the sport, he sits in a little wooden lodge, called scanescin, which is at one of the Maydan, set on four wheels, for the more convenient removal of it from one place to the other.\n\nOn the other side of the Maydan, over against the great mosque, are the wine taverns and other drinking-houses whereof we spoke before. There are several kinds of them. In the scire chanes, they sell wine; but those who have the least tenderness for their reputation will not come into those places which are infamous and the common receptacles of a sort of people who divert themselves there with music and the dancing of some of their common drabs, who having, by their obscene gestures, excited the brutalities of the spectators, get them into some corner of the house or draw them along into some public places, where they permit the commission of these abominations as freely as they do that of ordinary sins.\n\nIn the Tsia Chattai Chane, they drink thè, or tea, which the Persians call tzai, though the tzai, or the cha are probably but a kind of thè, and the chattai, in as much as it is brought them from chattai: we shall have occasion to speak more of it hereafter. They are only persons of good repute who drink of this, and frequent these houses, where in the intervals of their drinking they spend the time at a certain game somewhat like our Tick-Tack, but they commonly play at chess, at which they are excellent and go beyond the Muscovites, whom I dare affirm to be the best gamesters at chess of any in Europe. The Persians call this game Sedrentz, that is, Hundred-cares, in regard those who play at it are to apply all their thoughts thereto; and they are great lovers of it, inasmuch as from the word Shah, whence it hath its name, they would have it believed it is of their invention. Some years since, there was published in Germany, a great volume, upon the game of chess, wherein the author, too easily crediting Olaus Magnus , would have it believed that the ancient Goths and Swedes put those to play at chess who were suitors to their daughters, that by their management of that game, which hath no dependence on fortune, they might discover the judgement and disposition of their pretend sons in law. But these are only fables as is also what is related of one Elamaradab, King of Babylon. The governor of this prince was so tyrannical, as the story at least would have it, that no body thinking it false, to represent to him the dangers whereto his cruelties exposed the state and his own person, one of the lords of his council, named Philomester, invented the game of chess, which instead of openly opposing the sentiments of the tyrant, discovered to him the duty of a prince towards his family and subjects, by showing him the removals of the several pieces, by the representation of two kings, encamped one against the other, with their queens, their officers and soldiers; and that this wrought a greater impression on the king than all the other remonstrance that could have been made to him.\n\nThe Cahwa Chane are those places where they take tobacco, and drink of a certain black water, which they call cahwa [=coffee]: but we shall treat of both hereafter in this very book when we shall have occasion to speak of the Persians manner of life. Their poets and historians are great frequenters of these places and contribute much to the divertisement of the company. These are seated in a high chair in the midst of the hall, whence they entertain their auditors with speeches and tell them satirical stories, playing in the mean time with a little stick with the same gestures and after the same manner as those on who show tricks of legerdemain among us.\n\nNear these taverns of drinking-houses are the shops of surgeons and barbers, between which trades there is a great difference in Persia, as there is within these few years in France. The former, whom they call tzerrach, only dress wounds and hurts; and the others, named dellak, only trim unless they sometimes are employed about circumcision. These barbers are much taken up, for there is not a man but is shaved, as soon as any hair begins to appear; but there is not, on the other side, any who carries not this razor about him, for fear of getting the pox, which they are extremely afraid of, because it is very common among them and very contagious.\n\nAs you go to the Maydan, on the same side and turning on the right hand, you come to the bazaar, or true market-place, and in the midst of the market-place [there is] the kaiserie, or kind of open cloister where are sold all the richest stuffs and commodities that the kingdom affords. Over the gate of the structure, there is a striking clock made by an Englishman named Fesly, in the time of Shah Abbas: and in regard, that then there were few lords that had watches the Persians looked on the motions of that work as a thing miraculous and supernatural. This English clock-maker had met with the same fate as Rodolf Stadler, and had been cut into pieces by the friends of a Persian, whom he had killed and the clock had been out of order ever since his death.\n\nThe Bazaar\n\nSource: Chardin\n\nThis market-place consists of several streets, covered over head, and is so full of shops, and those shops so full of all sorts of merchandises, that there is nothing, though ever so rare in the world, which is not to be had here and at a very reasonable rate. For indeed there is nothing dear at Isfahan but wood and provisions inasmuch as there is no forest near it nor meadows for the feeding of cattle.\n\nOf all the shops I saw at Isfahan, I was not pleased so much with any as that of a druggist who lived in the Maydan on the left hand as you go to the Metzid, by reason of the abundance of the rarest herbs, seeds, roots and minerals it was furnished with. The root tzinae (not chinæ) which the Persians call bich tzini, and rhubarb, which they call rawentzini, and is brought thither from Chinæ, and great Tartary, were not worth here above three Abbass, or a crown the pound.\n\nThere is not any nation in all Asia, not indeed almost of Europe, who sends not its merchants of Isfahan, whereof some sell by wholesale and other by retail by the pound and the ell . There are ordinarily about twelve thousand Indians in the city, who have (most of them) their shops near those of the Persians in the Maydan, and their merchandises in the caravansaries, where they have their habitations and their store-houses. Their stuffs are incomparably fairer and their commodities of greater value than those of Persia; inasmuch as, besides the musk and amber grease, they bring thither great quantities of pearls and diamonds. I observed that most of these Indosthans [=Indians], had, upon the nose, a mark of saffron, about the breadth of a mans finger; but I could never learn what that mystery signified. They are all Mahumetans [=Muslims] of pagans: they burn the bodies of their deceased friends and kindred, and in that ceremony the use only the wood of the Mesch-Mesch, or apricot-tree. But of these, a particular account will be given in the travels of Mandelslo into the Indies. Besides these Indians, there is at Isfahan a great number of Tartars from the provinces of Khurasan, Chattai, and Bukhar; Turks, Jews, Armenians, Georgians, English, Dutch, French, Italians and Spaniards.\n\nThe city is supplied with provisions out of the other provinces of the kingdom. Out of that of Kirman, there are brought, in the winter time, fat sheep, and, in summer, lambs, which are sold, at Isfahan, at nine or ten Abbass a piece: for the very skin is worth five or six, upon the account of the fur, which is very precious there. The province of Kilan [=Gilan] furnished it with rice; and those of Kendeman, Tasum, Ebarku, and Jeschi, though they lie at a great distance, with wheat and barley. Wood and charcoal are sold here by the pound, the wood near half a penny, and the charcoal a penny a pound, in regard they are forced to bring it from Mazandaran and Jeilak-Perjan.\n\n[I have transposed a section on money to further down.]\n\nThe great trade of the city of Isfahan hath obliged the king to build there a great number of caravansaries. These are spacious store-houses, built four-square and enclosed of all sides with a high wall for the security of foreign merchants who have their lodgings in them, as also for that of the commodities they bring thither. They are two or three stories high and have within, many conveniences, courts, chambers, halls, and galleries.\n\nAmong other public structures, we may well take notice of the two monasteries of Italian and Spanish monks which are in the most northernly quarters of the city and about a thousand paces distant one from the other. One is the convent of the Augustine monks whereof we have spoken before; but the other is inhabited by certain Carmelites, who are Italians, and though they were but ten in all, yet one may boldly affirm that those of this order have not another convent in any part of Europe. Their priors name was F. Tinas, and he was, at our being there, very ancient, a good man, and of free disposition, as were also the other monks, who live among the infidels much more orderly than they do elsewhere. We are obliged to acknowledge their civilities, especially those among us who having the advantage of the Latin tongue could converse with them. We never visited them but they treated us with a collation and dismissed us extremely obliged to them for their kindness, as in other things, so particularly, in the instructions they gave us how we ought to behave ourselves during our abode in Persia. They presented M. Hierome Imhof (a senator of Nuremberg, and one of the chief gentlemen belonging to the embassy, who is now in Germany, in a court much different from that of Shah Safi) with a very fair Italian and Persian lexicon which he promises to publish with the Latin, since by him added to the other two languages. They did me, in particular, the favor, to afford me refuge in their convent, to protect me against the persecutions of the Ambassador Brugman, and to get my letters conveyed into Germany, with much safety and speed.\n\nAt the time of our being there they were also beginning to build a convent for certain French Caupcins, who had bought a place for that end within a quarter of a league of the monastery of the Augustines. They were but three in all, who seemed to be very good people and had attained some learning. They had finished the chapel and were then upon the dormitory, which had adjoining to it a kitchen-garden and a vineyard, with much likelihood they would not give over building with that.\n\nThe Skull Tower\n\nSource: Sanson\n\nBetween this last monastery and that of the Carmelites, are the kings stables, near which there is a pretty high tower, which is all built of earth and the horns of stags and ahus. They say that Shah Tamasp I [r. 1524-1576], having killed two thousand of those beasts at one hunting, employed their horns in that building in memory of so remarkable a defeat, and that he therewith made that tower which they call keleminar.\n\nThe parts adjacent to the city, are not unsuitable to the sumptuousness of its structures, and the greatest of so famous a metropolis. The kings gardens, which they call Charar Bagh, is no doubt one of the noblest in all the world. It is above half a league in a perfect square and the river Zayanda-rud, which hath spacious walks on both sides of it, divides it into a cross, so as that it seems to make four gardens of it. At one of its extremities towards the south there is a little mountain divided into several alleys which have on both sides steep precipices, in regard that the river, which they have brought up to the top of the mountain, does thence continually fall down by channels into basins which are cut within the rock. The channels were about three foot broad and were cut upon every side so as that the water falling directly down, and with a great noise into the basin, extremely delighted both the ear and the eyes. No basin but the water fell into it and upon every alley there was a basin of white marble which forced the water into diverse figures. All the water about the garden fell at last into a pond which in the midst of it cast up water forty foot high. This pond had at the four corners of it so many larger pavilions whereof the apartments were gilt within and done with foliage, there being a passage from one to another by walks, planted with tzinnar trees, whereof there being millions, they made the place the most pleasant and delightful of any in the world.\n\nThe fruit trees are not to be numbered, and there are of all sorts which Shah Abbas, who began this garden, had sent for not only out of all the provinces of the kingdom, but also out of Turkey and the Indies. Here you have all sorts of apples, pears, almonds, apricots, peaches, pomegranates, citrons, oranges, chestnuts, walnuts, filberts, gooseberries, etc., besides a great many not known in Europe. We saw there a kind of grape which they call hallague, of the bigness of a mans thumb, which had no stone [=seed], but the skin and meat firm and of admirable taste. This garden is kept by ten master-gardeners who have each of them ten men to work under them; and there is this further convenience in it, that when the fruits are fit to eat, they permit any that have a mind to go into it and to eat what they please of the fruits, paying four kasbeki, or two pence a piece; but they are forbidden to carry any away.\n\nThe city hath, on all sides, very large suburbs, which they call abath, whereof the fairest and most considerable is that which is called Julfa, wherein there are twelve churches and above three-thousand houses, equal in point of building to the best in the city. The inhabitants of this quarter are Armenians, Christians, and most of them merchants and rich men, whom Shah Abbas brought out of great Armenia, and planted in this place. They pay the king but two hundred tumans, by way of tribute, which amount to about thousand livers, which sum their daroga, who in our time, was called Chosrou Sulthan, and the Calanter, Seferas-beg, are obliged to bring into the kings coffers.\n\nOn the other side of the river Zayanda-rud, lies the suburbs of Tabrisabath, where live those who were translated thither out of the province of Tauristhan by Shah Abbas; upon which accompt, it is sometimes called Abbasabath.\n\nThe suburbs of Hasenabath is the ordinary habitation of the Tzurtzi, that is to say the Georgians, who are also Christians, and most of them merchants and wealthy men, as the Armenians, as well by reason of the trade they drive within the kingdom, as in all other places abroad. They delight much in making voyages, especially to the Indies and into Europe, insomuch that most of the merchants who come to Venice, Holland, and other places, and who are there called Armenians, are of this nation. Not that the Christians, whether Armenians, Georgians, or others, are not permitted to live within the city; but their living in there remote quarters proceeds from the desire they have to settle themselves in a place where they might live quietly and enjoy the freedom of their conscience. For the Persians do not only suffer them to inhabit any where, since they have a particular quarter assigned them within the city of Isfahan behind the Metzit Mehedi, in a place which they call Nessera; but they have also an affection for them, as well upon accompt of the advantage they make by trading with them and consequently the cultivation of vineyards. But the Persians, who are so given to wine, that it were impossible they should forbear it, imagine they commit no great sin in the drinking of wine, though it be done even to excess, provided their vineyards are dressed by Christian. The Armenians are expert enough at all things requisite to the ordering of the vines, but they understand nothing of the making or preserving of wine. They are no lovers of white wine, insomuch that when it hath not stood long enough in the vat, or is not high colored enough to their fancy, they pour into it a little brazil-wood or saffron to heighten its color. They do not keep it in buts or tuns, but either in great earthen pots or fill therewith the whole cellar without using any vessel at all.\n\nAn Old Inhabitant of Persia\n\nSource: Herbert\n\nThere is yet a noble part of the suburbs towards the west-side of the city, named Kebrabath, deriving its name from a certain people called Kebber, that is to say, infidels, from the Turkish work kiaphir, which signifies a renegat [renegade?]. I know not whether I may affirm they are originally Persians since they have nothing common with them but the language. They are distinguished from the other Persians by their beards which they wear very big as also by their habit which is absolutely different from that of the others. They wear over their waste-coats a cassock, or coat, which falls down to half the leg and is open at the neck and shoulders, where they tie it together with ribbons. Their women cover not their faces, as those of the other Persians do, and they are seen in the streets and elsewhere, contrary to the custom of those who pretend to live civilly; yet have they a great reputation of being very chaste.\n\nI made it my business to inquire what religion these Kebbers are of, but all the accompt I could have of them was that they are a sort of pagan who have neither circumcision, nor baptism, nor priests, nor churches, nor any books of devotion or morality among them. Some authors affirm that they have a certain veneration for the fire, as the ancient Persians had; but there is no such thing. They believe indeed the immorality of the soul, and somewhat consonant to what the ancient Pagans writ of Hell and the Elysian fields. For when any one of them dies they let a cock out of the house of the party deceased and follow him into the fields without the city, and if a fox take him by the way, they make no doubt but that his soul is saved; but if this experiment take not, they use another which in their opinion is more certain and infallible, which is this. They put about the deceased person his best clothes, hang several gold chains and jewels about his neck, and rings, and whatsoever else he had of most value of that kind upon his fingers and in his hands, and so dressed he is brought to the churchyard, where they set him standing against the wall and keep him up in that posture by putting a fork under his chin. If it happens that the crows or any other ravenous birds pick-out his right eye, he is looked upon as a saint, theres no doubt of his salvation, the corps is buried with ceremonies and is very gently and orderly let down into the grave. But if the said birds unfortunately make at the left eye, tis an infallible argument of his damnation, they conceive a horror at him as a reprobate, and they cast him headlong into the grave.\n\nThere are near and about Isfahan fourteen-hundred and sixty villages, the inhabitants where are all in a manner employed in the making of stuffs and tapestry, of wool, cotton, silk, and brocado.\n\nThe fields about the city lie very low, and it seems nature was willing in that to show an effect of her providence, inasmuch as were it not for that convenience the country would not be habitable by reason of the excessive heats which reign there. For the convenience they derive from this situation is this, that they can make the river Zayanda-rud overflow, when the summer heats have melted the snow on the neighboring mountains and draw it all over the fields. Johannes de Persia says indeed that the river, falling again into its channel, leaves a slime behind which corrupts the air; but he is mistaken. For it is certain that some provinces only excepted, which lie upon the Caspian sea, there is not any place in all Persia where the air is more healthy that at Isfahan.\n\nPERSIAN MONEY [transposed from pp. 299-300]\n\nPersian Coins\n\nSource: Tavernier\n\nThe ordinary money of Persia is of silver and brass, very little of gold. The Abbas, the garem-Abbas, or half-Abbas (which they commonly call Chodabende), the scahi, and bistri, are of silver. The former were so called from Shah Abbas, by whose command they were first made, being in value about the third part of a rixdollar; so that they are about 18d. sterling [d. denoted British pence] though they do not amount by weight to above 15d. Shah Chodabende gave his name to the half-Abbas. The scahi are worth about the fourth part of an Abbas, and two bistri and a half make a scahi. Shah Ismail had coined in his time a kind of money which was called Lari, and it was made after the manner of a thick Latin wire, flatted in the middle, to receive the impression of the characters, which showed the value of the piece. The Persians call all sorts of copper or brass money, pul, but there is one particular kind thereof, which they call kasbeki, where of forty make an Abbas. When they are to name great sums, they accompt by tumains [=tumans], each thereof is worth fifty Abbas. Not that there is any piece of money amounting to that sum, but the term is only used for the convenience of accounting, as in Muscovy they account by rubles and in Flanders by thousands of livers. They will receive from foreigners no other money than rixdollars, or Spanish ryals, which they immediately convert to Abbas, and gain a fourth part by the money. The king of Persia farms out the mint to private persons, who gain most by it, and share stakes with the money-changers, whom the call xeraffi, who have their shops, or offices, in the Maydan, and are obliged to bring all foreign money to the public mint, which they call Serab-Chane.\n\nThere is this remarkable as to the brass money, that every city hath its particular money and mark, which is changed every year, and that such money goes only in the place where it was made. So that upon their first day of the year, which begins on the vernal equinox, all the brass money is cryd down and the mark of it is changed. The ordinary mark of it is a stag, a deer, a goat, a satyr, a fish, a serpent, or some such thing. At the time of our travels, the kasbeki were marked at Isfahan with a lion, at Scamachie with a devil, at Kaschan with a cock, and in Gilan with a fish. The king of Persia, on the one side, makes a great advantage by this brass money, inasmuch as he pays for a pound of this metal, but an Abbas, which amounts to about eighteen pence, and he hath made of it sixty four kasbeki; and on the other he, by this means, keeps the kingdom from being too full of uncurrent and cryd down money.\n\nCLIMATE [pp. 303-304]\n\nTrue indeed it is, that the heats there are very great, especially in June and July, but the inhabitants are not much incommodated hereby. For as in winter they have their tenuers [=stoves] against the cold, so in summer they have their vaulted apartments and their halls and galleries, with windows of all sides, that the wind and air may find their passage in to moderate their great heats. And though it freezes there so little, that in a nights time it does not make an ice as thick as a mans finger, which thaws as soon as the sun appears over the horizon, yet have they a way to make the ice above two foot thick and to keep it to be used to cool their drinks in summer. To do this, they make choice of a commodious place, that is cool, and towards the north, paved with free-stone or marble, but between, and with little descent, upon which they pour the water and as soon as that is congealed, they pour on more, and by this means in one night they make an ice a foot thick, which in the daytime they cover, that the sun may not shine upon it: and so continuing the exercise for two or three nights together, they provide ice enough to serve them all summer. Having made as much as they desire, they break it in pieces and put it up into snow-houses, whereof there are so many at Isfahan that for two of three kasbekis, a man may have as much as will suffice him all summer.\n\nPersia, [which extends] from the 25 degree of the equator to the 37 northward from the equinoctial line, [ ] is seated in the temperate zone. Mount Taurus divides it in the middle, almost as the Apennine does Italy, thrusting forth its branches here and there into several provinces, where they are called by other particular names. The provinces, which have this mountain between them and the north, are very hot; but the others, which have it between them and the south, have a milder and more temperate air. The kings of Persia heretofore took this convenience, to change the places of the habitations according to the seasons, passing away the summer at Ecbatane, which is not called Tabriz, having the mountain between it and the south-west, and by that means not so much exposed to the great heats; and the winter at Sufe, in the province which from that name is now called Sufistan, where the mountain not only keeps off the north wind from annoying the inhabitants, it also sends them heat by the reflection of the sun beams at noon and makes the place so delightful that is hath thence the name Sufe, that is, lily. In spring and autumn they lived at Persepolis, or at Babylon. The modern kings do still use the same convenience. Shah Abbas lived in the winter at Ferabath in the province of Mazandaran, and Shah Safi sometimes at Tabriz, and sometimes at Ardebil, or Kazvin, The city of Isfahan is the most commodious of any, as well for winter as summer, inasmuch as being seated in a great plain, at, in a manner, an equal distance of three leagues from the mountain, there is always some little wind stirring which cools the air and comes into all rooms.\n\nWe had but too much experience of this change and the inconveniences ensuing thereupon, and found that the heats of the day and the cold of the nights of which Jacob made his complaints to Laban his father-in-law, are there equally insupportable. For being forced to travel in the night and that during the hottest season of the year, we felt there a cold which deprived us of the use of our limbs and made us many times unable to get off our horses, especially when there was an east or north wind: whereas, on the contrary, the south wind sent us sometimes such hot blasts as were ready to choke us.\n\nFrom what we have now said, it may be deduced that all the provinces of Persia are not equally healthy, and that there are some where diseases are much more common than in others. Those of Schirwan [=Shirvan] and Gilan are very much subject to fevers; but the air of the city of Tuaris is so good that a man hears no talk of that disease there. Nay, on the contrary they say that those who are troubled therewith may find their remedy in that place, even without taking any physic. Epidemical diseases, such as the bloody-flux [=dysentery] and the plague, are not so ordinary here as in Europe. The pox, which is called Sehemet Kaschi, that is, the Disease of Kaschan, in regard it is more common there than elsewhere, or that there notice was first taken of it, (as it is called in France, the Neapolitan Disease, and in England and other places, the French, inasmuch as instead of going to Naples for it, where the French were infected in the time of Charles VIII [r.1483-1498], they may now have it as conveniently at Paris) is very common at that place. Tis true Kaschan is a place excellently well seated, but the air must be somewhat unwholesome, when they want fresh water thereabouts, and that it is here the tarantulas and the most dangerous scorpions of all Persia are most rife. The dropsy is not very rare in the province of Gilan; but there are very few troubled with the stone in any part of the kingdom; and for the gout, it is a disease not yet known among them. The inhabitants are long lived, it being an ordinary thing to see persons of a hundred years of age. I knew a judge in the province of Serab, between Mokan and Ardebil, who was a hundred and thirty years of age; and the father of Hacwerdy, who went along with us into Holstein, was above six score. Their temperance and sobriety contributes much to the good condition of the body, the continuance of their health, and length of their lives.\n\nSOIL & FARMING [pp.304-305]\n\nAs to the soil of Persia, the province of Gilan excepted, which is very fertile, it is sandy and barren in the plains, every where in a manner of checkered with little red stones and not bringing forth ought but thistles and reeds, which they use for firing in their kitchen instead of wood, where there is not any. The province of Gilan only hath nothing of this drought. But in the uneven parts of the country, where the mountains make several valleys, the ground is very good. Accordingly in these places it is that most of their villages are seated, inasmuch as they are very ingenious in conveying the water, which rises out of the mountains, by channels of about four foot in breadth which they use in their gardens and many times in tilled lands, to those places where it seldom rains. To give the earth that moisture which Heaven hath denied it, they raise up the ends of their lands, which are about fifteen or twenty fathom square, a foot higher than any other part, into which they let in the water out of their channels over night and the next morning let it out again: so that the earth, which hath been thus moistened, receiving the sun beams almost perpendicularly, brings forth all sorts of fruits in great abundance.\n\nIn the cultivation of their ground, they make use of ploughs, which are so big in those places, where the soil is strong and fat, as it is in Iruan and Armenia, that many times twenty or four and twenty buffaloes, or wild oxen, are hardly able to draw them and they require six men to drive them. The furrows are a foot deep and two foot broad. They ordinarily sow only rice, wheat, and barley. They care not for rye, and when there chances to be any grains of it among the wheats, as this often degenerates into the other, they weed it out and cast it away. Oats is a kind of grain not known among them. They sow also millet, lentils, peas and beans. [They] call the quiches, nagud, and the common peas, kulul.\n\nThey sow also whole fields of ricinus [=castor-oil plant?], or palma christi, which they call kuntzut. They beat the grain thereof. To get an oil out of it, which they call schirbach, and it is sweet and pleasant, and very good to eat. The peasants also eat the grain; and mixing it with quiche and currens, they make their deserts of it.\n\nThere is in a manner no province of Persia but brings forth cotton, which they call pambeb, and there are whole fields covered therewith, especially in Armenia, Iruan, Nachtzuan, Kerabath, near Arasbar, in Adirbeitzan, and in Khurasan. It grows upon a bush, two or three foot high, having leaves like those of the vine, but much less, and shoots forth at the extremity of its branches a bud of about the bigness of a nut, which, when fully ripe, opens in several places and thrusts out the cotton through the clefts that are in the shell. Though there be abundance of it spent in all sorts of stuffs made in the country; yet do they drive a vast trade with that which is unwrought. The province of Gilan brings forth also a kind of flax, the thread whereof is very good and fit for cloth.\n\nDOMESTIC ANIMALS [pp. 305-307]\n\nThe domestic creatures, as well such as are used in carriage, as others, are sheep, goats, buffaloes, oxen and cows, camels, horses, mules, and asses. The ordinary forage for horses is barley mixed with chaff, or rice mixed with shredded straw. The Persians water not their horses till an hour and a half after they have eaten, contrary to the ordinary custom of the Turks, who water theirs immediately after they have given them their allowance. There is in Persia a certain kind of herb, which they call Genscheht, which is sown much after the same manner as we sow Saint-John, once in seven years. It grows up three foot high and brings forth blue flowers. It is cut twice a year, and they are only persons of quality who give it to their horses. There is very little common hay, unless it be in the province of Iruan, and Armenia. In some provinces they do not make any at all, because there is grass enough all year long.\n\nOf all cattle, they have most sheep. Of these they have very great flocks and it is their most ordinary food, though it be not of so pleasant a taste to those who are not accustomed thereto. They are much of the same bulk with those of Europe, and sometimes a little bigger, but short and flat-nosed with the ears hanging down, as our spaniels. They are but lean, in regard the tails, which weight ten, twenty, nay sometimes thirty pounds, draw all the fat out of them. The tails have the bones and joints, as our sheep have, but the fat hangs to them in great gobbets like locks of wool, which much hinders them from running or leaping. In Kurdesthan, near Diarbeker, and in Sirie, they have the invention of putting the tails of these creatures upon a kind of little cart with two wheels, which is fastened by a little stick to the necks of them. The sheep we saw among the Tartars, upon the Caspian sea, are in all things like those of Paris; but those of the Tartars of Usbeque and Bukhar have a grayish long wool, curling at the end into little white and close knots like pearls, which makes a pretty show, whence it comes that their fleece is more esteemed than their flesh, inasmuch as this kind of fur is the most precious of any used in Persia, next to sables. They are very tenderly kept, and for the most part in the shade, and when they are obliged to bring them abroad, they cover them as they do horses. These sheep have as little tails as our.\n\nThe Persians have also great flocks of goats, and they eat the flesh of them. Of the suet they make candles; and it is of their skins that they make the leather which we call marroquin or Spanish leather, and is brought through Muscovy and Poland into the other provinces of Europe.\n\nThey have an abundance of buffaloes, especially towards the Caspian Sea, in Forab, near Ardebil, in Eruan, and Surul where some peasants have five or six hundred of them. They are kept in moist places, and they say their milk is very cooling, as is also the butter made thereof. They have also oxen like those in Europe; but, in the province of Gilan, they have a bunch of fat upon the neck, as those of the Indies have. I have been told, that the cows will not suffer themselves to be milked, if their calves be not brought before them so that is a calf chance to die, (for they never kill any to eat) they fill the skin with straw, cast a little salt upon it, and they let the cow lick it, by which means she stands quiet to be milked.\n\nThe Persians have an aversion for swine; whence it comes that the Armenians themselves who live among them seldom breed any, unless it be in those places where they live apart, as in the suburbs of Julfa, where they have some few. They conceive they have a very good reason to have an aversion for this creature, following the example of the Jews\n\n[I have omitted a short tale concerning the aversion.]\n\nCAMELS, HORSES, MULES, ASSES [pp. 307-309]\n\nThey have several sorts of camels. Those which have two bunches they call bughur and those which have but one, schuttur. Of these last there are four kinds, that is, those which by way of excellence they call ner, that is to say, the male, which is engendered of a dromedary, or camel, with two bunches and a female that hath but one, which is called maje, and these are not to be covered by any of another kind. These are the best and most esteemed of all the camels, insomuch that some of them are sold at a hundred crowns apiece. They carry nine-hundred or a thousand weight [=pounds?] and are in manner indefatigable. When they are hot they eat little, foam at the mouth, are angry and bite, so that to prevent their doing any injury to those who govern them they have a kind of muzzle put over their mouths which the Persians call agrab. The camels, which come of these, degenerate very much and are heavy and slow, whence the Turks call them jurda kaidem, and they are not worth above thirty or forty crowns.\n\nThe third kind is that which they call lohk, but these are not so good as the bughurs, nor do they foam at the mouth as the ners when they are hot: but when they go to rut they put out under the throat a red bladder which they draw in with their breath, lift up their heads and snort often. These are worth about sixty crowns apiece. They are not near so strong as the others, whence it is that when Persians would speak of a stout and daring man, they say he is a ner and when they would express a poor-spirited and cowardly person they call him a lohk.\n\nThe fourth kind is, by the Persians, called schutturi baad, and by the Turks, jeldovesi, that is, wind-camels. They are much less in bulk but more active and sprightly than the others: for whereas the ordinary camels go but a foot-pace, these trot and gallop as well as horses.\n\nThe king and the khans have many teams of them, and every team consists in seven camels couples together. They use them at magnificent ceremonies, either to meet ambassadors, covered with covering clothes of red velvet or pack-saddles made of the same stuff, embroidered with gold and silver, with silver bells about their necks, or to ride post, nay sometimes in the wars, in which they are thus much the more serviceable that, in a defeat, they contribute much to the saving of the baggage. They trot so hard that the boy who guides them (and to that ends gets up first) is glad to be tied to the panel of saddle by the waist. When they run, they put out their heads and open their nostrils and run with such violence that it is impossible to stay them. At our entrance into Scamachie and Ardebil, we saw a great number of them galloping, sometimes before, sometimes behind us.\n\nThis is one of the greatest conveniences that travelers meet with in Persia, as well for the carrying of their own persons, as the conveyance of their baggage and commodities which they may, by this means, transport from one place to another at a very easy rate and with little trouble. One man guides a team, or as many as are fastened together, and if a man thinks it not safe to travel alone, he may join with the caravans, which go perpetually up and down the country, and with these is the safest way of travelling.\n\nThe travelling of the camels is at a certain rate, and therefor their stages being set, they find it no great trouble to make them reach their ordinary lodgings  which are either in villages upon the highway or at caravanseras, expressly built for the entertainment of the caravans. Some of these caravanseras have persons in them, who are as it were hosts and sell provender, but in others you have only the bare walls. It is not great charge to keep the camels. Their sustenance is thistles and nettles, and sometimes they thrust down their throats a hard paste made of the chaff of barley, about three pound in weight, much after the fashion of the loaves which the French soldiers who serve in the low-countries corruptly call brindestocq. Sometimes they put into this paste cotton seed, which is very sweet, and as big as a great pease. They can endure thirst for two or three days together; wherein nature seems to have made some provision against the extremity men are put to, for want of water, when they travel over the deserts and heaths of those hot and dry countries. They only touch the knees of their fore-legs to make them bow to receive their burdens, and being so laid with their bellies on the ground, they suffer a man to order them as he pleases. The harmonious sound of a mans voice or an instrument enlivens them; whence it comes that the Persians tie little bells about their knees and a pretty big one about their necks, not only by reason of the long trains of them that go together (it being necessary they should be heard at a great distance to give those notice who might unadvisedly come between them,) but also to divert these creatures in their travel through the deserts of their country, inasmuch as whipping or beating does not make them advance; but music, especially a mans voice, animates and inspires them with a certain courage. What most troubles the camel is a king of snail, called mohere, which sometimes lies within the thistles; if these sting them in the nostrils it proves mortal.\n\nThe camels are very revengeful and remember a long time any injury they have received: insomuch that in Persia a camels anger is come into a proverb, when they would speak of an irreconcilable enmity. As to this particular there is a very memorable example of a camel which being hot and having not the muzzle on, bit a servant who went along by him in the arm. The servant gave him a many blows about the neck with a cudgel, which part is the tenderest about these creatures. But the camel had a cruel revenge of him, ere they came to their journeys end. For some time after, being got loose in the night, he went among the servants who by reason of the cold lay near the camels that they might thrust their feet under their bellies, and having pitched upon the person that had beaten him, he trod on him so as that all his bones were crushed and broken. The servants father demanded satisfaction and had the camel adjudged him to be disposed of as he pleased. If anger proceed from choler as its principle, a man may justly wonder whence it comes that Pliny says that camels, horses, and asses have no gall. Nor could I ever find any reason why the same Pliny should affirm, after Xenophone , that camels have an aversion for horses. When I told the Persians of it, they laughed at me and said it that it was not without reason camels have an aversion for horses; when many times horses may get into the stables and have a house over their heads, whereas the camels, which cannot get in by reason of the lowness of the doors, are forced to lie abroad and to suffer the horses to take up their quarters. And indeed there hardly goes any caravan but a man may see camels, horses, and asses put up together in the same stable, yet express not any aversion or animosity one against another.\n\nTrue indeed it is that the females go twelve months, but those are extremely misinformed who believe that the male, when he covers her, turns his hinder part to her. This mistake took its rise hence, that the camels, when they make water [i.e, urinate], put their yards backwards between their hinder legs, but in the work of generation they use them otherwise. The female lies down upon her belly and the male covers her after same manner as horses do. And though this creature be of a great bulk, yet is not its generative member, which is as at least three foot in length and thicker than a mans little finger. This animal is seldom eaten, as being more serviceable in point of work; but when they fall under their burdens, or in case they be stung by one of the moheres, they kill them with two thrusts into the throat: one at the place where it joins to the head, the other towards the breast, and then they them.\n\nThere are [an] abundance of horses in Persia, most of them well made. They are very handsome about the head, neck, ears, crupper, and legs. Media bred heretofore such excellent horses that they were all kept for the king. The horses of those parts are at this time very good ones, and there are of an excellent breed in the province of Erscheck, near Ardebil; but it is with-all certain that the Arabian horses are incomparably better, and accordingly more esteemed by the king, who makes them the chiefest ornament of his stables. Next [to] those, they most value those of Turkey, though the king hath good breeding places in several provinces of his kingdom, especially in Erscheck, Shirvan, Karabug, and Mokan, where is the best meadow-grounds in Persia. They make use of them for the most part for mens riding, very seldom for the carriage of commodities, and never almost in the cart, which, all over Persia, hath but two wheels. And whereas the main forces of the kingdom consist in their cavalry, it thence comes that they are great lovers of horses and very tender in the keeping of them. Yet with all this care, do they not make use of straw for litter, but of horse-dung, which they dry in the sun and make beds of it a foot deep for the horses, which could not lie more at their ease upon quilts. This litter serves them a long time, and when it is moistened with stale they put it into the sun, dry it again, and so continue to make use of it. With their soft beds they also cover them with a hair-cloth, lines with a king of soft coarse cloth. They also fasten them by the hinder feet, to a stake, that, in case they should break of slip their halters, they may not get away, or hurt the other horses. All the manage they bestow on them consists only in accustoming them to start away, as lightning, at the beginning of a race, and they call those horses which exceed in swiftness, bad-pay, that is, windy-heeled. If their horses be white or gray, they color the main and the tail, and sometimes also the legs, with red or orange; wherein the Polanders and Tartars are wont to imitate them. They do not in any thing make so great ostentation of their expense, as in what is employed about the harness of their horses, which they sometimes cover with plates of gold or silver and adorn the reigns, saddles and covering clothes with goldsmiths work and embroidery. Yet is not this custom of so late a beginning, but that there may somewhat of this kind be observed out of the most ancient authors of the Greek history.\n\nThey have also a great number of mules, which for the most part are used only for riding. The king himself and the khans ordinarily ride upon these, and they stood us in good steed when all other kind of riding had been very troublesome to us in our sickness. They yield as good rate as horses, so that a mule (though none of the best nor very handsome) is sold at least for a hundred crowns. I was told there were some white ones, but they are very rare and highly valued; and I must confess, I never saw any.\n\nAsses are very common all over the East, but in Persia more than anywhere, and especially at Isfahan, where there is an infinite number of them, in regard they allow not carting within the city. Those who drive them have at the end of their whip a great bodkin fastened with a chain, wherewith they make a noise and are perpetually pricking of this creature, which seems to be more cold and heavy in this country than anywhere else.\n\nFRUIT [pp. 309-313]\n\nThe heats are so great in Persia, and the weather so constantly fair, and clear in the summer, that it is not to be much wondered they should have such good and excellent fruits. As for those which are spent in the kitchen, they are there in great abundance, but incomparably better and more savory than in Europe. Among others, the onions are so big in the province of Tarum, near Chalcal, that one of them will weigh three pound. The cabbages are there curled, very tender, and of an excellent taste.\n\nTheir most precious fruits are the melons, and as their care in the ordering of them is extraordinary, so they have every year great quantities of them. They should sow them all only in good mold, yet are there not any but what are very excellent. There are two sorts of them, to wit, those which they call kermek, from the word kerm, which signifies hot, in regard they are eaten in the summer, and they come betimes, and are fully ripe in June. These are yellow as gold and the sweetest of any. The other sort they call charbusei pasi, and they come not to perfect maturity till Autumn. These are very big and weigh thirty, forty or fifty pound weight. They are kept not only all the winter but even till there are new ones to be had, and this is done with such industry that to distinguish them from the new ones a man must put his finger to them and see whether the rind gives way; and by this means they are never without melons. They have a way also to keep grapes by wrapping them up in green reeds and hanging them up to the roof of their chambers. There is yet a third sort of water-melons, which they call hinduane, in regard the first of them were brought out of the Indies, as we said elsewhere in the description of the city of Astrakhan, where we had some occasion to speak of this kind of fruit. It is very big and yet the stalks of it are so small that the Persian poets use them in their inventions to make a comparison between them and the wall-nut tree, which being a great and lofty tree yet brings forth but a small fruit, to show that many times a person of mean birth may do very noble actions and that on the contrary a great prince may do things that are poor and unfruitable to his extraction.\n\nThey have also several sorts of citrulls, or citrul-cucumbers, and among the rest one which they call kabach, and may be found among the herbalists under the name of cucurbita lagenaria. They are about the bigness of a mans head and sometimes bigger, and have a long neck. They are eaten green and before they are come to their full maturity: for when they are ripe the rind dries and grows as hard as the bark of a tree or boiled leather, and the meat within is so consumed that there being nothing left but the seed, the Persians use them instead of flagons and make drinking cups of them.\n\nThey have yet another kind of fruit not know in Europe which they call padintzan. They are like little melons, or rather, cucumbers. The fruit is green, save that at the end towards the stalk it is sometimes of a violet color. The seed is round and long and of a pretty bigness. This is not eaten raw because it is a little bitter; but being boiled or fried in butter it is a delicate dish.\n\nThe climate of Persia is excellently good for the vine. There is no province in the whole kingdom which doth not bring forth excellent grapes, but in regard the Mahumetan law forbids them the use of wine, they accordingly neglect the cultivation of the vine.\n\n[I have omitted a short fable concerning the reason why the Persians allegedly drink no wine.]\n\nThe Persians in obedience to Muhammads command make no wine, but in regard they are great lovers of it, they do not only permit the Christians to make thereof, but indeed the chief reason why they permit the Armenians to live among them is that they may buy thereof of them. They do not make it so well as it is done in Europe, and have not the ingenuity to put it into buys, but keep it in great earthen pitchers, each of which contains near half a barrel, as we said elsewhere. The sedr, that is, the chief of the religion of the Persians, to express his zeal did sometimes order the pitchers of the Armenians to be broken. The Persians are permitted to make a syrup of sweet wine which they boil till it be reduced to a sixth part and be grown as thick as oil. They call this drug duschab, and when they would take of it they dissolve it with water and add thereto a little vinegar, all which together make a very pleasant drink. The minatzim (or astrologer) of Schamachie gave me of it at a treatment he made for me at his own house. In the more northerly provinces of Persia, where the wine is not very good, the in habitants disolve the duschab in the country wine whereto they by that means give both the color and taste of sack [?].\n\nSometimes they boil the duschab so long that they reduce it into a paste for the convenience of travelers who cut it with a knife and disolve it in water. At Tabriz they make a certain conserve of it which they call helwa, mixing therewith beaten almonds, flower, and peeled filberts or small nuts. They put this mixture into a long and narrow bag, and having set it under the press, they make of it a paste which grows so hard that a man must have a hatchet to cut it. They make also a king of conserve of it, much like a pudding, which they call zutzuch, thrusting through the middle of it a small cotton thread to keep the paste together.\n\nThere are some chemists who maintain that by the same reason, to prevent the charges arising upon the transportation of wine, it were possible to reduce five tons to one by causing sweet wine to be boiled away to the fifth part. For as they say there is no likelihood the wine should lose out of its spirits before its hath wrought and is disposed into vessels, and that afterwards adding thereto as much fair water, out of which the superfluous humor hath evaporated, it might be restored to the same quantity and reduced to the same degree of goodness it had been of before. But I am of opinion that if this were feasible the experiment had been long since tried, especially in France, instead of turning wine into aquavitae.\n\nThere are two sorts of grapes in Persia, but the best and sweetest are at Shiraz and Tabriz; whence they bestow on the most delicate if them the name of taberschi. This grape is long and hath no stone, and it may be kept all winter. Those which they call keseki are yellowish and sweet, and grow in Tarum, at Tabriz, and at Ordebath: but of these a man must eat sparingly, for fear of a bloody-flux.\n\nThe small grapes which we call currents are there yellowish and bigger than those with grow in the Isle of Zanthe. They call them kischmisch, and the best of them grow at Bawanat near Herat. Besides these, there are yet several other sorts of grapes not known in Europe, among the rest, those which they call hallague. The grape itself is above an inch and a half thick, but the meat of it is hard, juice-less, and without stones, and they are kept all the year long: as also the enkuri alideresi, the bunch whereof is above a foot long and the grapes are about the bigness of a damson, of a dark red color, full of juice and very sweet; but they will not keep. There does not grow any of these save one place, in the province of Iran, between Ordabath and Choddaserin. They derive their name from the prophet Ali, who being one day in winter at that place, desired a vine-dresser whom he met to give him some grapes; whereto the other making answer that it were impossible to satisfy his desire in that season, Ali bid him go into the next vineyard and he should find some. He went and according as he had said, found the fairest grapes he had ever seen; upon which occasion they are called enkuri Ali deresi, that is, the grapes of the little valley of Ali.\n\nThere is not fruit-tree in Europe but is to be found in Persia; but besides those they have many not known to us; as a sort of pears which they call melletze, which grow near the city of Ordebath, about the bigness and much color of citrons. The scent of them is very sweet and pleasant and they are very juicy, but not delightful to the taste.\n\nPomegranate-trees, almond-trees, and fig-trees gown there without any ordering or cultivation, especially in the province of Gilan, where you have whole forests of them. The wild Pomegranates, which you find almost everywhere, especially at Karabag, are sharp or sour. They take out of them the seed, which the call nardan, wherewith they drive a great trade, and the Persians make use of it in their sauces whereto it gives a color and a piquant taste, having been steeped in water and strained through a cloth. Sometimes they boil the juice of these pomegranates and keep it to give a color to the rice, which they serve up at their entertainments, and it gives it withal a taste which is not unpleasant. The Persians use sharp sauces with most of their meat and thence it comes that among them you very seldom find any person troubled with the scurvy, which is a disease too well known and mortal in several provinces of Europe.\n\nI shall say nothing of those other fruits which we have also in Europe as of their narintz, or oranges; limec, citrons; meschemeschi, apricots; scafrals, peaches; etc., only thus muchthat they are not equally good everywhere. The best pomegranates grow in Jescht and at Kazvin, but the biggest in Karabag. Isfahan is famous for its good melons; Kazvin for its peaches; Tabriz for its apricots; and the provinces of Gilan and Lahetzan for silks.\n\nThe trees out of which they get this rich commodity may no doubt be very well numbered among the fruit-trees, not only in regard that it is true they bear fruit, but also upon this score: that the Persians everywhere fill their gardens with these plants. They are white and black mulberry-trees which they plant so close one by another that a man can hardly pass between the trees, but they order them as bushes and suffer them not to grow about five foot and a half high, that they may easily reach to all the branches.\n\n[I have transposed a section on silk production to further down.]\n\nWe may put into the number of the fruits of this country, the neste, which is gotten out of several sources near Baku; as also the salt, which is drawn out of the salt-pits of Nachtsuan; but this is fairer and as clear as crystal in Kulb, Vrum, Kemre, Hemedan, Bisethun, Suldus, and Kilissim. There are no other pits or mines where they work. There are indeed certain forges at Masula, and Kientze, but the best iron comes from Masula, where it is so soft and tractable that it is malleable and yields to the hammer without hating. There are gold and silver mines between Serab and Miane, but they cannot be wrought for want of wood, which is so scarce thereabouts that the advantage might be made of them would not defray the charges. Between Pirmaras and Schamachie we saw a mountain of lapis specularis, which when the sun shone upon it looked like a heap of diamonds.\n\nSILK PRODUCTION [transposed from pp.312-313]\n\nIn the spring, as soon as these trees begin to shoot forth their leaves, the Persians begin to hatch their silk-worms. To do this they carry the see in a little bag under the arm pit where the heat of seven or eight days hatches them. Then they put them into a wooden dish upon the mulberry- leaves, which they change at least once a day, having a great care that they be not wet. At the end of five days they sleep three, and then they dispose them into rooms, or barns, kept very clean and prepared for that purpose, and in the province of Gilan they have particular buildings for that end. Along the beams of these buildings they nail laths, or cleft pieces, such as hoops are made of, upon which they lay the mulberry branches with the leaves on, and put the worms upon them, every day changing these branches, and at least when they are grown pretty big, twice or thrice a day; and they so shut all overtures of the barns, which are covered with nets, that the very birds cannot get in to eat them. In the mean time (and before they begin to spin) they sleep eight days more; but there must be a great care taken that women troubled with their monthly infirmity come not near them, inasmuch as it would kill them and as it were smother them in their own moisture. After seven weeks life they begin to spin, which is known as well by their satiety, in regard they then give over eating as by the silk which comes out at their mouths. They suffer them to work twelve days at their cod, and in the mean time they very carefully watch the place where they spin. That time expired, they find as many cods as there had been worms, and they make choice of the biggest for the seed. All the rest is cast into a kettle of boiling water, into which they ever and anon put a besom made for that purpose, whereto the silk sticks and they immediately wind it up, and what remains they cast away. [It is] that which is kept in a temperate place till the year following. In this commodity of silk consists the greatest trade of all Persia, nay in a manner of all the East, as it is in effect the most richest and most noble of any that is driven in Europe.\n\nTHE PERSIANS' APPEARANCE [pp. 313-319]\n\nThe Persians are of mean stature, Xenophone says, that they were most of them bulky and fat; and Marcellinus, on the contrary, affirms that in his time they were spare bodied and dry. They are so now, but strong and have great limbs, their faces inclining to an olive color, black haired, and hawk-nosed. The men are shaved once in eight days, contrary to the custom of the ancient Persians who suffered their hair to grow as do at present the Seid [=Sayyid], that is, the kindred of Muhammad, who, as they say, went so. They also shave their beards, leaving only mustaches. They are only a sort of Religious men, called Pyhr, who suffer their beards to grow upon their chins and about their cheeks. These people are in great veneration among them, upon the accompt of their apparent sanctity, which principally consists in abstinence. There are also those who never cut their mustaches, which by that means cover their mouths, and this they do in remembrance of their prophet Ali who wore them in that manner. These last are called Sufi, and they say Ali wore his mustache so, for the following reason: that when Muhammad took that voyage to paradise, which the Quran speaks of (Azoara 27,) Ali followed him. At first they made some difficulty at the gate to let him in, till such time as he told the porter that he was Schir Chodda, that is, Gods Lion. Being got in he saw that the angels made Muhammad drink of a certain excellent wine, whereof he was so happy as to have one goblet presented to him, which he took off; but some drops of the divine draught sticking on his mustaches, he would never afterwards suffer them to be cut.\n\nThe Persians have a great fancy to black hair and they bear with the flaxen-haired but not without some trouble; but before red-haired people they have a strong aversion. They have so great an esteem for black hair that when it is not fully black they color it so. To do that they make use of the herb and seed of wesme, which is brought from Baghdad and is somewhat like that which the herbarists call securidaca, which they beat very small with the rinds of pomegranates and mix therewith soap and arsenic. They boil this composition in spring-water and rub their hair therewith, which they afterwards wash with a strong lye made with unflaked lime. They make use of the water which issues out of the vines in the spring-time: the men rub their mustaches therewith, and maids their hair, which fall down over their shoulders tied up in several tressesout of an opinion they all are of, that this makes them grow.\n\nThey have also a custom of painting their hands and above all their nails with a red color, inclining to a yellowish or orange, much near the color that our tanners nails are of. There are those who also paint their feet. This is so necessary to ornament in their married women, that this kind of paint is brought up and distributed among those that are invited to their wedding dinners. They therewith paint also the bodies of such as dye maids, that when they appear before the angels examinants, they may be found more neat and handsome. This color is made of the herb which they call chinne, or sometimes only fair water; and therewith they color their hands. And if they would have them to be of a darker color they rub them afterwards with wall-nut leaves. This color will not be got off in fifteen days, though they wash their hands several times a day.\n\nTheir cloths have no proportion to their limbs. Their coats and upper garments are large and hang loose, not unlike the garments of women. They express a certain effeminacy in their gate. They go as it were jetting and waddling and with very little gravity. I am of opinion that this scurvy habit is derived from their manner of sitting, which is, as our tailors do, whereto being accustomed from their infancy, they are not so strong in the hams as they would otherwise be. Diodorus Siculus ascribes the invention of this kind of garments to Semiramis, and tells the occasion of it as do also most of the other ancient authors. The coiffure of the men, which they call mendils, and the Turks tulbans [turbans], is made of cotton cloth or some silk stuff that is very fine and of several colors, and being about eight or nine ells in length comes many times about their heads, having the folds slightly sowed or drawn with a gold thread. Those of their priests and particularly of the Hafis is white as are also all their garments. There are some [who] put to their mendils a tassel of silk, which hangs down their backs or over their shoulders, a quarter of an ell or better in length. The Seid, that is, those who pretend to be of the posterity of Muhammad and assume the title of his successors, have their mendils of green silk. Some Persians, even of the greatest of the kingdom, wear furred caps, the inside and outside being of Bukhar sheep skin, so as that the wool hands down from the edges the length of a mans finger and is as soft as silk. These caps are esteemed in Persia as the castors are in Europe, and are sold at ten or twelve crowns a piece. They wear these about their heads in summer as well as winter, though a man might think that by reason of the extreme sultriness of the weather they should be very troublesome and incommodious.\n\nThis custom of keeping their heads always very hot brings them to that tenderness that they dare not expose them to the cold, [nor] in calm weather. To this purpose I conceive I may allege what Herodotus says, to wit, that after a fight between the Persians and the Egyptians where there fell a great number of men on both sides, care was taken that the bodies of both parties were disposed into several places, and it was found sometime after that the skulls of the Persians were so thin and delicate that a man might thrusts his finger into them, and that on the contrary those of the Egyptians were so hard that they could not be broken with stones. The reason he gives for it, is that he says the Egyptians who were accustomed from their infancy to go bare headed in the sun were by that means grown hard whereas the Persians having their heads always wrapped about were very tender in their skulls. And indeed they never uncovered them, neither at their devotions nor when they salute other men, no not when they speak to their king: but when they salute any, they do it by a low inclination of the head and putting of their hand to their breast.\n\nMany of the Persians where red caps, whence the Turks take occasion to call them by way of derision Kisilbaschs [=Qizilbash], that is to say, red-heads. Most authors who treat of the affairs of Persia write this word Cuselbas, Queselbach, or Querselbach; but the right name is Kisilbasch, as being compounded of the word kisil, which hath two different significations, to wit, that of red, and of gold, and basch, which signifies a head. Pualus Jovius in the thirteenth book of his Histories, and after him F. Bizarro in the tenth book of his History of Persia, affirm that Tesellis, disciple of Harduellis (otherwise named Eider) who as they say lived about the beginning of the sixteenth age, was the first who brought the Persians to wear red caps, to distinguish them from the Turks, at their separation from them in the business of religion. But they are both mistaken: for the truth is that the Persians, when they broke communion with the Turks and made a particular sect of the Muhammad religion, by the advice of Schich-Safi, the author of their new opinions, immediately held that the first successors of MuhammadOmar, Osman, and Abubekrhad usurped the succession to the prejudice of Alis right, and would have this last be accounted the prophet, and that his twelve successors (whom we shall name hereafter when we come to speak of the religion of the Persians) were canonized and put into the number of their Imams, or saints; that they were looked upon as having that quality, and that their ecclesiastics or religious men wore red caps made with twelve folds, in form much like the bottles used in Lanquedoc and Provence, which have great and flat bellies and very long and narrow necks.\n\nThis difference in matter of religion occasioned a great war between the two nations wherein the Turks making advantage of their arms were very cruel towards the Persians, but especially the ecclesiastics by reason of the aversion which they had for that new religion. And in regard their coiffure, or what they wore about their heads, distinguished them from the others, they left off their caps in several places of the kingdom and obliged the rest to follow their example.\n\nthis persecution lasted till Shah Ismael I, finding himself forced by the Turks to retreat into the province of Gilan and having some reason to fear that within a short time he might see the whole kingdom in the hands of the professed enemies of his religion, resolved to meet them and to put all to the hazard of a battle. To this end he sent persons to represent to the provinces and the chief cities of the kingdom, the danger whereto the state, their liberties, and religion were exposed if they resolved not to make what opposition the could in that extremity against the Turk, sending them word that he would grant those who should serve him in person, in that conjuncture of affairs, a general and perpetual exemption, for them and their posterity. By this means he got together an army of three-hundred thousand fighting men, wherewith he marched directly to Ardebil, as desirous to begin his exploits by a pious enterprise, in recovering the sepulchre of Schich-Safi out of the hands of the Turks, who were forced out of that city. He was no sooner become master of it, but he confirmed all he had promised touching the exemption, and to the end those might be known who were to enjoy the benefit of it, he ordered the making of these red caps, which were done with twelve folds in remembrance of their twelve Imams. But in regard the city was not able to find scarlet enough for so great a number of caps, a shoe-maker of Ardebil would needs make twelve of them of maroquin, or goats leather, of the same color, which Shah Ismael presented to the chief commanders of his army. He ordered them to be red, to make a certain representation of the crown of Ali, whom the Persians give the quality of king, as well as of prophet, as they do these caps the name of tatsch, that is to say, a crown. Whence it comes that the Persians are so far from taking it ill that they are called Kisilbaschs, that they think it an honor done them, though in effect only those of the posterity of Ali and these exempted persons wear red caps: the former having them covered with linen cloth, or some other king of stuff, and the other without anything at all about them. The posterity of these exempted persons do still enjoy the privileges, and out of them is chosen the guard for the kings person, as being looked upon as the Swizzers [=Swiss mercenaries?] are in the courts of diverse princes of Europe.\n\nTheir ordinary habit are a kind of sleeveless coats of cotton or silk of several colors, which come down to the calves of their legs. Those of cotton have flowers printed upon the cloth and are quilted as mattresses. They draw the sides of them together under the left arm and gird themselves with a scarf about two ells in length called tzarkefi, which comes several times about the body. The richer sort have upon this another rich scarf which they call schal, made of a very fine stuff brought by the Indians into Persia: for their silk being much fairer and their colors more lively and finer than those of Persia, their stuffs are accordingly more highly esteemed.\n\nWhen the mollas, or priests, come before the medere, they take off that rich scarf to express their humility. The other Persians wear in it a poniard, their knives, their handkerchiefs, and their money; and those whose profession it is to write for others carry in them their ink-horns, a pen- knife, and a little whetstone, letters, and all that the Muscovites are wont to thrust into their boots or buskins which serve them instead of pockets. Persons of quality and the king himself wear over this coat a kind of rochet without sleeves, which reaches but to the waste, bordered with sables. When they go abroad (whether afoot or on horse-back) they cast over these a silk garment of diverse colors, or wrought with gold flowers, which they call jakub cahni, from a king of that name who was the first that ever wore them in Persia. Their breeches are of cotton, made after the fashion of drawers; accordingly they wear them under their shirts and they reach down to their feet. Their shirts are of cotton cloth, and for the most part streaked with red. Their stockings are of woolen cloth, unhandsomely cut out, without any shape or any proportion to the leg. They wear them very wide and commonly they are made of green cloth; a color which is abhorred by the Turks. This is indeed one of the chiefest differences of their religion, upon this accompt: that Muhammad having worn a green cap, the Persiansthe more to dishonor that colorput their feet into that which their great Prophet wore about his head. Their shoes, which they call kefs, are very picked at the toe and very low quartered, so as that they put them off and on with as much ease as we do our slippers. Which convenience they the more stand in need of, in regard they put them off in the antechamber, at their own houses as well as when they visit their friends, either upon business or otherwise. To this purpose I remember that one day going to the khan of Scamachie, about the time he gives audience for the administration of justice, we found in the antechamber more shoes than the richest shoe-maker thereabouts had in his shop, and standing by them, one I may call the shoe-keeper, who with a forked stick gave those their shoes who went out.\n\nThe women wear much finer stuffs than the men do and have not anything to tie about the waist but their drawers and shirts of men. Their stockings are ordinarily of red or green velvet and they have little or no ornament about their head but suffer their hair to hang down negligently in several tresses, down the back and about the shoulders. All the ornament they have about their heads consists in two or three rows of pearls which they do not wear about their necks (as women do elsewhere) but about the head, being set over the fore-head and falling down along the cheeks to be fastened under the chin so as that their faces seemed to be set in pearls. Which may give a little light to that expression in the Canticles, Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels. Young maids sometimes wear rings with precious stones in them, in their right nostril as the Tartarian women do.
