        "text": "This article examines the social makeup of the early Qajar administration or chancery (dīvān). Using a wide range of Persian sources, the article focuses on those individuals who held offices in the dīvān and traces their family, social, and geographic backgrounds, highlights their marital ties, and reveals their sources of economic and social prestige. In doing so, the article draws attention to patterns of continuity and change between Safavid, Afsharid, Zand, and Qajar rule, and to the familial and informal nature of political power during the early Qajar period (1785–1834). Ultimately the article suggests that an analysis of the social makeup of the dīvān, and of what political office-holders actually do, offers a more fruitful pathway for understanding the formation of Qajar Iran than a focus on institutions and political structures.\n\nAuthor's note: For their constructive critiques of earlier versions of this article, I thank Abbas Amanat, Dominic Parviz Brookshaw, Arash Khazeni, Tanya Lawrence, and the anonymous IJMES reviewers. I also wish to thank Akram Khater and Jeffrey Culang for their help in shepherding the article through the review process and preparing it for publication. Finally, this article benefited from the questions and discussion during the Middle East Studies Association's 2017 Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\n1 “Administration” is an admittedly inadequate translation of dīvān, which can be alternatively translated as “administrative office,” “chancery,” or even “government.” None of these terms, however, captures the full meaning of dīvān. The essential idea behind the word—which some scholars argue is derived from the Old Persian word meaning “inscription” or “document,” while others say is derived from the Arabic verb meaning “to collect” or “to register”—is that the dīvān is where government ministers, secretaries, and scribes conduct their record-keeping and administrative business. During the early Qajar period, the dīvān was also called the daftar-khānih (Chamber of Records). See Shirazi, Mirza Fazlullah Khavari, Tarikh-i Zu al-Qarnayn, ed. Afsharfar, Nasir (Tehran: Kitabkhanih, Muzih, va Markaz-i Asnad-i Majlis-i Shura-yi Islami, 2001), 1:243Google Scholar; and Malcolm, John, The History of Persia from the Most Early Period to the Present Time (London: John Murray, 1815), 2:437Google Scholar. For more on the history and usage of the word dīvān, see François de Blois and C. Edmund Bosworth, “Dīvān,” Encyclopaedia Iranica, VII/4, 432–38, accessed 10 January 2018, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/divan; and A. A. Duri et al., “Dīwān,” in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, eds. P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs, accessed 10 January 2018, http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0170.\n\n2 There is a large body of writing on the “political men” of the Qajar period (rijāl-i dawrih-yi Qājār), which provides biographical information on—as the words suggest—the political men of the 19th century and their families. Most of this scholarship has focused on simply tracing the family backgrounds and networks of the men who held ministerial and secretarial posts. In that sense, the works are akin to the Dictionary of National Biography in the British context. For some examples, see Bamdad, Mahdi, Sharh-i Hal-i Rijal-i Iran dar Qarn-i 12, 13, 14 Hijri, 6 vols. (Tehran: Zuvvar, 2008)Google Scholar; al-Mamalik, Dust ʿAli Khan Muʿayyir, Rijal-i ʿ Asr-i Nasiri, 3rd ed. (Tehran: Tarikh-i Iran, 2010)Google Scholar; Nuri, Husayn Saʿadat, Rijal-i Dawrih-yi Qajar (Tehran: Intisharat-i Vahid, 1985)Google Scholar; and Sasani, Khan Malik, Siyasatgaran-i Dawrih-i Qajar, 2 vols. (Tehran: Intisharat-i Hidayat, 1974)Google Scholar. Even those scholarly works with a more analytic approach tend to be schematic and focus on the macro level. See, for instance, Shaʿbani, ʿAli, Hizar Famil (Tehran: Bu ʿAli, 1987)Google Scholar, whose book divides Iranian history from the 18th to the 20th centuries into five distinct periods: the tribal era (dawrih-yi khānkhānī), the epoch of princes (ʿ aṣr-i shāhzādigān), the emergence of ministers (ẓuhūr-i dīvānsālārān), the presence of statesmen (ḥużūr-i dawlatmardān), and parliamentary government (ḥukūmat-i pārlamānī).\n\n8 For studies on Qajar efforts to create a centralized bureaucracy, see Bakhash, Shaul, Iran: Monarchy, Bureaucracy, and Reform Under the Qajars: 1858–1896 (London: Ithaca Press, 1978)Google Scholar; Bakhash, Shaul, “The Evolution of Qajar Bureaucracy: 1779–1879,” Middle Eastern Studies 7 (1971): 139–68CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Sheikholeslami, A.

There are exceptions, of course. For an example of a study that places early Qajar kingship in the context of historical Persian, Turco-Mongolian, and Islamic institutions, see Amanat, Abbas, Pivot of the Universe: Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar and the Iranian Monarchy, 1831–1896, 2nd ed. (London: I.B.Tauris, 2008), 7–13Google Scholar.\n\n9 The relationship between the ʿulamaʾ and the Qajar state has generated vigorous scholarly debate.

For an example of how local urban elites were not necessarily intermediaries between the state and local society, and sometimes acted as a self-determining political force of their own, see Thompson, Elizabeth, “Ottoman Political Reform in the Provinces: The Damascus Advisory Council in 1844–45,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 25 (1993): 457–75CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n18 This is less true in the Ottoman context, where scholars have tied the growth of provincial households to the expansion of the empire. For example, see Khoury, Dina Rizk, State and Provincial Society in the Ottoman Empire: Mosul, 1540–1834 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997)Google Scholar.

The other main dīvān positions of the early Qajar period included the revenue secretary to the army (lashkarnivīs), head of the dīvān (ṣāḥib-i dīvān), court chronicler (vaqāyi ʿ -nigār), mint master (mu ʿ ayyir al-mamālik), reader of the khutba at ceremonial occasions (khātib al-mamālik), and chief astrologer (munajjim-bāshī). See Lambton, “Persian Society under the Qajars,” in Qājār Persia: Eleven Studies, 99.\n\n40 “Statement of the Fixed Revenue of Persia, 1811,” 8 August 1811. IOR/L/PS/9/67 f. 6, The British Library. There is no mention of an author on the document, but the date suggests it may have been Gore Ouseley, the British envoy in Iran in 1811. It is unclear how the Qajar government's financial information came into the hands of the British. Thus the figures in the statement should be read with caution. Nevertheless, the statement does illustrate that revenue was collected from at least Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Khurasan, Arak, Fars, and tribes like the Bakhtiyari and Khudabandihlu.\n\n44 For an early Qajar taẕkirih of women poets, see Qajar, Mahmud Mirza, Tazkirih-yi Nuql-i Majlis, ed.
