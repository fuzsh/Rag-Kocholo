The center of Shaft was formerly called Goorab. Shaft was situated near the 'Nasir Mahaleh' Village where vestiges can still be noted.\n\nRural economic activities include rice cultivation, fish farming, and animal husbandry. On Mondays, Doshanbeh Bazaar, a local trade market is held there. That is why many know the place as Doshanbeh (Monday). Its local dishes are pala kebab, baghlaghatogh, and jaghoorbaghoor."
