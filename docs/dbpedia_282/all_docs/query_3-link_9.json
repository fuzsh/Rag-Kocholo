        "text": "Rasht\n\nIran\n\nRasht, city, capital of Gīlān province, north-central Iran. It lies about 15 miles (24 km) south of the Caspian Sea on a branch of the Sefīd River, where the higher ground merges into the marshlands fringing the Mordāb, or Anzalī (formerly Pahlavī), lagoon. Rasht’s importance as the main city of the Gīlān region dates from Russia’s southward expansion in the 17th century. The city suffered severely during World Wars I and II from Russian occupation and afterward from economic decline.\n\nThe city is surrounded by rice fields and areas of half-cleared jungle. The mostly two-storied houses have much woodwork, such as broad verandas and overhanging eaves; roofs are red-tiled, and the houses often are raised from the ground. Modernization is confined to the main streets.\n\nBesides being a cultural centre, Rasht is a market and processing centre for rice, tea, peanuts (groundnuts), and silk; soap, glass, razor blades, and jute bags are manufactured. In 1962 a large dam on the Sefīd River was completed. Rasht is connected by road with the Caspian port of Bandar-e Anzalī (formerly Bandar-e Pahlavī), Tehrān, and Tabrīz; it also has an airport. Pop. (2011) 639,951; (2016) 679,995.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Zeidan."
