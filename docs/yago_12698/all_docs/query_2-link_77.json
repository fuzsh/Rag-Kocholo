        "text": "Antonio Seguí is one of the most famous Argentinian artists. After extensive travels he settled in Paris in 1963 where he still lives today. His early work still dealt with the abstract, at the beginning of the 1960s he moved towards figurative painting and developed a distinctive style, to which he has remained true to this day. Motivated by the hectic and anonymous modern city life, he constructed picture-filling, confusing scenes reminiscent of a toy world. Busy, bustling protagonists are reduced to men of simplified body shapes. Seemingly all equiped with the same characteristic physiognomy, their individuality is only noticed on close inspection. With its stylised houses and trees, they are placed in a neutral, undefined environment, which is abruptly bound by the picture frame. Trapped in their isolated picture world, their hustle and bustle seems even more futile."
