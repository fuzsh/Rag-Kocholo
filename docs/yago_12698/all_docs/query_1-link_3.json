        "text": "Uruguayan Literature\n\nIt is impossible to include in this short essay the immensity of Uruguayan authors that were writing and publishing novels between the mid 1960s and early 70s, coinciding with the production of drawings from El Dibujazo. Mario Levrero and Cristina Peri Rossi, born in 1940 and 1941 respectively, exhibit distinct narrative styles: oneiric Kafkaesque in the case of Levrero versus Peri Rossi’s baroque satire. Despite these differences, the pair has been named the “irrealistas” (irrealists) due to their shared ambivalent relationship with reality.\n\nMy points of entry into Uruguayan literature of the 1960s and 70s are Levrero’s first novel, La ciudad (The City) , and Peri Rossi’s short story “Los extraños objetos voladores” (The Strange Flying Objects) from her second book, Los museos abandonados. Reading these stories in tandem with Dibujazo drawings, it is evident that they share a despise of a hegemogenic reality. Certain subjects are present in both texts and images. Coincidentally, both texts were illustrated by Dibujazo draftsmen. This confluence, which initially seemed serendipitous, reflected the deep and close working relationship between Dibujazo artists and writers.\n\nPeri Rossi’s Uruguayan edition of Los museos abandonados features cover art by Carlos Pieri (fig. 1). The artist had been commissioned by Arca Editorial, a publishing house funded in 1960 by prominent literary critic Ángel Rama, to design the series cover art for its paperback imprint Bolsilibros. His drawing shows a man in profile standing under a streetlamp wearing a hat, and in his coat pocket, a miniature man reading a book. The cover of Levrero’s La ciudad was designed by Domingo Ferreira and displays a black line-drawing of a man, in a shirt and tie, looking pensive against a white background (fig. 2). The folds of his shirt are so voluminous that it is impossible to distinguish arms from body, front from back—a reference to the spatial and temporal distortions that take place in the story.\n\nBoth La ciudad and “Los extraños objetos voladores” create immersive atmospheres filled with strangeness and absurdity. In Peri Rossi’s short story, we meet an elderly couple, Lautaro and María, who live in a remote countryside area. In the opening scene, their lives are disrupted when they discover a brown object flying above them, seemingly observing them. María thinks of the object as company, and is concerned about its lack of rest, being out there all alone in the sky. Lautaro, in turn, soonafter develops an optical deficiency that causes elements to vanish from his field of vision. First, his face and body begin to disappear, then his bed, his tools, and the trees outside his house. During dinner one evening, he refuses to put his fork down on the table, fearing that once out of his hands, it too will vanish. As Lautaro begins to spiral into paranoia, no longer able to differentiate between reality and illusion, he makes a visit to a doctor in the neighbouring town. Without much hesitation, the doctor gives him a pill, and suggests that he look at himself in the mirror. Miraculously, the viejo has recovered his missing side. He heads back home content and relieved only to discover, once he arrives, that everything has vanished: his home, his wife, and the trees have disappeared, leaving only dry soil behind.\n\nLevrero begins his novel with a quote from Kafka that describes a city on the horizon that does not materialize beyond its blurry outlines, an epigraph that foretells what will unravel in the story. We are introduced to an unnamed first-person narrator for whom we are provided no spatial reference other than that he is inside an old, damp, half-empty house. We do not learn why he is there, how long he intends to stay, or how he arrived at the house. As with the rest of the story, scenes unfold in a dreamlike fashion. After leaving the house in search of food, the main character not only fails to find a shop but descends into a nightmareish adventure where space and time collapse. He walks for hours down roads leading nowhere, eventually encountering a woman, Ana, who despises him yet seduces him. She later disappears with another man once they reach the town. When the narrator asks the people in “the city” for directions to her house, they are unable to provide them, despite knowing its location. The narrator eventually makes a friend, Giménez, who offers him a place to stay, but, continuing in the vein of the mysterious and nonsensical, he provides labyrinthical directions to his room, and lies about knowing the woman he’s trying to find. The events surrounding this character are difficult to comprehend yet easy to accept, reminiscent of the Kafkaesque sense of the inexplicable yet familiar.\n\nWhereas Peri Rossi breaks the narrative pact of realism with the reader from the outset by introducing an intentional flying machine/creature, Levrero takes a more gradual approach, progressively dissolving the boundaries of reality as we follow the character through seemingly neverending adventures.\n\nA Distorted, Surveilled Atmosphere on the Brink\n\nWhat kind of intensities do we encounter in these stories and how are they conveyed in the drawings that accompany them? In what ways do these texts facilitate our appreciation of and attunement to the artworks? This essay considers how these narratives activate and affect our perception of the accompanying Dibujazo artworks. In navigating this atmospheric shift, images selected from ISLAA’s archive—by Alberto Schunk, Beatriz Battione, Eugenio Darnet, and Eva Aldama—are presented not merely as illustrative or representative but as comprising independent works that echo the thematic concerns and sentiments expressed in the stories of Levrero and Peri Rossi.\n\nDistortion\n\nIn these images and the mentioned stories, time and space are distorted. In Schunk’s drawing (fig. 3), walls, floors, and ceilings wrap, contour and dissolve, blending into one another—a literal unfolding of space. Similarly, in Levrero’s story, as the narrator walks endlessly, he notices that “the blocks were not even, but took on strange shapes, even circular and elliptical.”\n\nIn Beatriz Battione’s drawing, it is the scale that appears deeply warped (fig. 4). Her image transforms the domesticity of a checkerboard flooring into an infinite field interrupted by two hidden precipices. The sky, full of lines, appears shattered or on the verge of collapse, evoking the fragility of the moment. While there is no fog, some thin, intersecting lines are visible on the horizon. Central to the drawing is a gigantic creature—an animal made up of many others standing large and tall next to miniature trees, not far from an immense fork.\n\nSurveillance\n\nThe unnamed narrator in Levrero’s novel does not experience surveillance per se but does, at times, expresses perplexity at how the generous Giménez seemingly anticipates his needs. With no solicitation from the narrator, Giménez prepares a table with food and washes and folds his clothes. In the drawings by El Dibujazo artists, surveillance is often symbolized by the presence of an eye. In his untitled drawing from 1972, Eugenio Darnet captures one of the most striking and terrifying gazes present in this collection (fig. 5), where an eye appears to merge with what resembles a foot with a single toe or a tongue. Battione saturates her image with eyes as well, depicting an ant-spider-fly creature with a disproportionately large black eye that occupies most of its face. Drowsy eyes also appear inside the watch that hangs from the collapsing sky. Aldama conceals large, half-open eyes in the amorphic ground of her drawings (fig. 6). In Peri Rossi’s story, the bird-animal-machine looms in the air over Lautaro and María’s home in the dry countryside, unabashedly watching over them:\n\n“The brown object drifted unhurriedly through the air, between one cloud and another. It moved slowly, as if looking at them.”"
