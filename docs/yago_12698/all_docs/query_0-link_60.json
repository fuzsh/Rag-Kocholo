        "text": "Initially, the Audiovisual Studies Research Group focused its research work on the systematic analysis of the trans-regional integration Galicia-North of Portugal, having as main activity the preparation and publication of biennial reports on the state of the Galician audiovisual. With the passage of time, it extended its scope of work and today it deals with the study of a wide range of issues related to communication and culture in the Atlantic periphery, the Portuguese-speaking area and the European sphere.\n\nBased on different approaches -political, social, economic…- and with special attention to the construction of identity(s) and the preservation of cultural diversity, it articulates interdisciplinary research proposals whose results are directed to the scientific community, those responsible of public policies, the professionals of the sectors involved and the citizenship in general."
