        "text": "I have a mix of emotions while writing this blog post from the Atlanta airport and a few thousand miles away from Buenos Aires. I’m so incredibly grateful to have been able to participate in the Plus3 program this year and travel to such a beautiful city, but I am also very sad that we…\n\nToday, we left our second home, Argentina. In the morning, I went to Templo Libertad and after, I got a bagel with lox and cream cheese with a coffee, obviously. After, we had a final bbq with IES and ate Choripan and queso bites. My travels were as follows: bus to airport, plane to Atlanta,…\n\nI cannot believe today is our final day in Argentina. For our last day in Argentina, we all had a farewell lunch planned by the IES coordinators. We had a BBQ lunch which reminded me of when we first arrived unaware of what experiences laid ahead of us. Yesterday it was Julie’s birthday and the…\n\nToday was really nice because the day didn’t start until the afternoon, so I was able to go out and get some breakfast at a local cafe. The agenda for the day consisted of two museum visits, which started at a museum dedicated to the history of Argentine immigrants. The museum was a converted hostile-like…\n\nToday was our last day in Argentina and it was a bittersweet time. These past two weeks have been so much fun and its been a trip I will never forget. From the 12 hour delay in the airport two weeks ago to returning home today, our group has become great friends and experienced so…\n\nI learned so much on this trip. Not only about the healthcare systems, but how to be abroad. It was my first time out of the country without parents and I am so glad I took the leap to go. I learned how to work better with my peers through the group project and loved…\n\nI can’t believe our trip has already come to an end. I can’t even begin to express how happy and grateful I am to have been able to experience this with all these amazing people. I have learned so much about the Argentine healthcare system and Argentine culture overall over the past 12 days, and…\n\nI really enjoyed my time here in Argentina. I met some really cool people that I formed real friendships with, and I learned some really interesting things not just about the healthcare system, but also about the culture and way of life here in Argentina. I learned that the people here drive like maniacs. I…\n\nToday, we took a bus to visit one of the Obras Sociales, Medife! They were located in a very nice building, and even had tea for us which helped with the sickness that the chilliness of Buenos Aires gave me. Dr. Florencia Ledesma led the discussion, and provided us with all the information about Ase…\n\nToday was filled with museum visits. We started the day around 1:30 and enjoyed Bagels & Bagels for breakfast. Our first visit was to Museo de Inmigrantes. Argentina’s culture developed through the variety and blending of different cultures through immigration. Immigration was prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries and became a melting pot from…\n\nThis post was one of the saddest I have had to write, as it is my last one. Although Argentina was not necessarily my first choice for the Plus3 Program, I would never trade this experience for the world. The bonds I have formed with people outside my business bubble are ones I will truly…\n\nWe’re approaching the end of our time in Buenos Aires. Tomorrow we have our final presentations and last full day in the city. We’ve completed all our lectures, which meant today was much more relaxing. In the morning, we had a lot of free time and spent it going to the Japanese Gardens and shopping…\n\nToday is the last and final day of the trip. Yesterday since we didn’t blog, I’ll just do a quick fill in. So, we started the day later and but were still productive as we had our final presentations at the University of Austral. With so much information being given during lectures from very powerful…\n\nToday, we went to La Boca again because there was so much left to explore. I also needed to buy gifts for my friends and family. After, we went to the Museum of Immigrants. The museum was built from an old hotel for immigrants. In Argentina, there was a large wave of immigration, especially southern…\n\nToday, we had a pretty late start to the day, so I started my morning off by sleeping in! (which was a first for this action-packed trip) After I finally work up, we managed to find a bagel place around two blocks from the hotel, so I used that as my fuel for the day…\n\nToday, we had a late start so fortunately we were all able to sleep in. It was a much more relaxed day with only two museum visits. In the morning, a group of us decided to visit La Boca again and look around the shops. There were so many stands with various souvenirs and the…\n\nToday, we took a break from lectures and hospital visits and headed to two museums in the city. Before that though, some friends and I headed to La Boca, one of the neighborhoods that we visited earlier in the trip. We spent the morning walking around and shopping at the variety of vendors that lined…\n\nToday we had a late start and I started off with going to lunch at Mr. Ho. I love Korean food and believe this was one of the best I ever had. Of course, I had to go to Cafe Mago for my daily coffee. The late start was a huge refresher and I had…\n\nToday was a more relaxed day and different than the rest. To start it off we got to sleep in and did not have a scheduled event until 1:30. It was so nice to have a break and get to relax in the morning. But we did have to do something productive so at 1:30…\n\nToday was one of my favorite days in Argentina. We went to visit the hospital and it was on the poorer side. It looked out dated compared to the private hospitals I have visited so far. I learned it was a tertiary hospital and it has around 303 beds. One of the biggest departments was…"
