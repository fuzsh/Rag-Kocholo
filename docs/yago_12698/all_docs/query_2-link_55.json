        "text": "Vista Energy, the second-largest unconventional oil operator in Argentina, increased production 14% quarter over quarter.\n\nIn fourth-quarter 2023, the company had average daily production of 56,353 boe, driven by the start of production from 11 new wells in Vaca Muertaâ€™s Bajada del Palo Oeste block.\n\nOil production was 48,469 b/d, a 17% quarter-on-quarter increase.\n\nIn its earnings release, the operator said it has solidified its position in Vaca Muerta as a low-cost operator and is entirely focused on the development of unconventional oil. By 2026, Vista aims to produce 100,000 boe/d, and by 2030, it expects to reach 150,000 boe/d.\n\n\"Throughout 2023, we achieved significant progress in the development of our areas in Vaca Muerta. The results obtained in our Bajada del Palo Este block allowed us to derisk a significant extension of our acreage, which had a substantial impact on the additions to proven reserves,\" said Miguel Galuccio, president and chief executive officer.\n\nProven reserve additions totaled 85.5 MMboe, representing a reserve replacement ratio of 458%.\n\nVista's proven oil and gas reserves in the Bajada del Palo Oeste block were estimated at 221.8 MMboe.\n\nProven and estimated (P1) oil and gas reserves as of Dec. 31, 2023, experienced a year-on-year increase of 27%, totaling 318.5 MMboe."
