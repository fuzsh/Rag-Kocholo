        "text": "𝐈𝐓 𝐍𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐑 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑𝐓𝐄𝐃 𝐎𝐍 𝐎𝐂𝐓 𝟕 The narrative that the conflict began on October 7 is a gross oversimplification and distortion of the truth. This conflict has deep historical roots that cannot be ignored or erased. The oppression, occupation, and systemic injustice against Palestinians have been ongoing for decades. The suffering and resistance didn't begin on October 7, it's a continuation of a long-standing fight for rights, freedom, and dignity. 𝐀 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐟 𝐇𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲: ☑ 𝐍𝐚𝐤𝐛𝐚 (𝟏𝟗𝟒𝟖): The catastrophe that saw the displacement of over 700,000 Palestinians from their homes, marking the beginning of a long journey of statelessness, exile, and ongoing struggle for the Palestinian people. ☑ 𝐎𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐚𝐳𝐚 (𝟏𝟗𝟔𝟕): Following the Six-Day War, Israel occupied these territories, leading to decades of military control, settlement expansion, and severe restrictions on the daily lives of Palestinians. ☑ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐬 (𝟏𝟗𝟖𝟕-𝟏𝟗𝟗𝟑, 𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟎-𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟓): The Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation highlighted the desperate need for freedom and self-determination. These periods were marked by significant violence and loss. ☑ 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐬: Checkpoints, home demolitions, restrictions on movement, and systemic discrimination have become part of the daily reality for Palestinians living under occupation. These measures have perpetuated a cycle of poverty, frustration, and resistance. The history of this conflict is rooted in a persistent quest for justice and self-determination. We must challenge the misleading narratives and educate ourselves and others about the real, unbroken chain of events leading to the present. It’s crucial to acknowledge and address the historical injustices to pave the way for a just and lasting peace. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐈𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: Understanding the full context of the Palestinian struggle is essential for anyone who advocates for human rights and justice. Simplifying the conflict to recent events ignores the deep-seated issues that need to be addressed. The path to peace requires a comprehensive understanding of these historical injustices and a commitment to rectifying them. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐖𝐞 𝐃𝐨: ☑ 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞: Learn about the history and share this knowledge with others to combat misinformation. ☑ 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞: Support policies and movements that promote justice and equality for Palestinians. ☑ 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲: Join global movements and initiatives that aim to end the occupation and support Palestinian self-determination. #Palestine #HistoricalContext #JusticeForPalestine #EndTheOccupation #HumanRights #FreePalestine #NeverForget #GlobalSolidarity #Nakba #Intifada #PeaceAndJustice\n\n1\n\nDispute Settlement Body (#DSB) of the #WTO was one of the most prominent achievements of the Uruguay negotiation round in which previous dispute settlement mechanism of #GATT was updated. However, it's been about 6 years since United States halted the primary function of the DSB by not allowing the member states to select the adjudicators of the Appellate Body. Regarding this matter & by using the data collected by Global Trade Alert, Professor Krzysztof Pelc of McGill University has published an interesting article on the MPIA; the alternative solution of some member states for the mentioned issue. You can find my #Persian translation of his article via the link below:\n\n26\n\n4 Comments\n\nMartyr Ismail Haniyeh's daughter addressing the Arab leaders: You have no right to talk about Iran, which is more honorable than you. Latifah Haniyeh: Who says Iran is the cause of terror? You Arabs do not welcome him in your countries, are you closer to us than Iran?! But Iran supported us better than you, and therefore you have no right to talk about Iran , which is more honorable than you, in the sense that it is the capital of Islam . 📍P.N.: An Arab girl, a Sunni Muslim and a resident of the Mediterranean coast, considers neither Egypt, nor Turkey, nor Saudi Arabia, but Iran as the capital of Islam, and in this matter, it can be a deep understanding for those who are familiar with the minimum of civilized culture.\n\nFollowing video confirms2 aspects here: 1-Helplessness of American systems: economy, media and politics, whether the ruling class or the opposition sides together with the most important component; the establishments, both civil & military.

You can’t study the history of Zionism and not be horrified. It’s as simple as that. They don’t want you to understand the reality of the situation, which is that you have one of the most powerful states in the world, and one of the most powerless peoples in the world. The people with the power want you to think it’s complicated — that there are two equal sides here. There’s a long history of Palestinian nonviolent resistance. In almost every single case, the Israeli military resorts to disproportionate and indiscriminate violence in response.\" To understand the Israel-Palestine conflict, start with these two simple questions. Historian Zach Foster uncomplicates the long, tangled histories of Palestine, Israel and Zionism — and breaks down the biggest myths clouding the conversation. https://lnkd.in/g4QZpvzH\n\n35\n\n7 Comments\n\nThe conflict is not with the Palestinians The Israeli Arab conflict is about the existence of Jewish people in the land of Israel and in addition it's the Arab adoption of the Nazi Ideology to destroy the memory of the Jews from the world. This new approach started even before the Nazi ideology, but when the local Arabs massacred happened in 1926-1929 it was about pure greed. it happened even before in the history and it was all about envy and greed and robbery. This was nothing typical to Muslims, everywhere in the 11-18 centuries all small European, Arab or others were robbing each other, raping, kidnapping and taking property by force. so nothing is new. The hammas-iran-hezbolla etc. are all in the same as were the Nordic tribes, the Berbers, Ginges Khan, Romans, ancient Persian etc. Nowadays the Arabs, not all of them, become such savages. they even attack Russia (Chechnya) and tried China(ougur) and try to build a khlifate of Daesh, It's just another phase in history. who knows to what extent it'll develop.\n\nThis is the Zionist Crown Prince Pahlavi Reza - of Iran He’s living in exile in America - after his father’s reign of terror perpetrated on Iranians, which is what ushered in the then popular Islamic uprising in 1978. He is the de-facto leader of Iranian expat liberal extremists in the West. He made a speech yesterday at the far-right think-tank, National Conservatism - who are climate-change deniers amongst other fruity things. “Iran will once again be a close ally of… Israel & the Arab states & see the Abraham Accords grow to the Cyrus Accords”. He is saying this admidst a genocide perpetrated by Israel. A genocide in which the Lancet has reported the real number of Palestinians murdered will be north of 189,000. The far-right and liberal-extremists converge on their hate for the Palestinians, and their rejection of a Palestinian state. Neither believe Palestinian lives matter. PS: ironically, National Conservatism is a project of the Edmund Burke Foundation, which purports to be founded on the principles of Edmund Burke. Burke was a British politician in the 18th century who in fact was a moderate and interestingly, one of the principles he believed in was: “the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state”. A quick glance through and research of people on the board of the Edmund Burke Foundation proves they’re all Zionists, and we know how deceitful many Zionists can be - the movement of Zionism itself was founded to deceive people, mainly the Palestinians. The Edmund Burke Foundation is evidently no different; created under the facade of moderation, when in actual fact it’s a far-right extremist group, with views that are dangerous for the global community. - Silence is complicity #SpeakUp4Palestine - Views are my own, they do not represent the views of any of my past or present employers or clients, and a “like” is not necessarily an endorsement.\n\n41\n\n34 Comments\n\n🔻 THE HYPOCRISY of U.S. AID MONEY🤑 🔻 ⁉ 26.4 Billion USD being gifted to Zionist regime ⁉ #funding #genocide American Taxpayer Money to restock interceptors, buy advanced weapons. And start another war, as if one wasn't enough! It still needs to pass the Senate, however. Aid Money should be contributed to world #peace, #prosperity and #stability. In the name of aid, U.S. has acted recklessly, committed numerous misdeeds and committed numerous crimes. Throughout the past 70 years, the primary goal of U.S. foreign aid has always been to serve its own interests and safeguard its own security. 💠 #SELFISHNESS Goals such as promoting global poverty alleviation and development have always given way to U.S. strategic goals, which disguise the real intention of U.S. aid. “foreign aid is no different from diplomatic or military policy or #propaganda\". 💠 #ARROGANCE The United States often attaches harsh conditions that undermine the sovereignty and dignity of the recipient countries, and wantonly points fingers at the recipient countries’ internal affairs. #GENOCIDE #PALESTINE #IRAQ #VIETNAM\n\n4"
