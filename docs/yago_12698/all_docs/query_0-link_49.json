The compact 5x5 unit is similar to a small closet, perfectly fitting a few medium-sized moving boxes, a dresser, and a small bookshelf. On the larger end, the 5x15 unit offers a walk-in closet space, ideal for storing a sofa, mattresses, and several large moving boxes from a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nMedium Self Storage Units\n\nMedium Self Storage Units range from 10x10 to 10x15 and offer versatile storage solutions. The 10x10 unit is ideal for fitting two bedrooms' worth of furnishings — such as nightstands, bedframes, mattresses, and dressers — and is roughly half the size of a one-car garage. For those needing more space, the 10x15 unit, which is about the size of a small one-car garage, can comfortably accommodate the contents of three bedrooms or a medium-sized apartment.\n\nLarge Self Storage Units\n\nLarge Self Storage Units in sizes 10x20, 10x25, and 10x30 are designed for more extensive storage needs. The 10x20 unit, as spacious as a standard one-car garage, can store belongings from a small house or multi-bedroom apartment, including entire sets for living rooms, kitchens, and two bedrooms. Moving to a 10x25, you'll find it comparable to a large one-car garage, perfect for a car or all the furniture from a medium-sized home, such as bedroom sets, appliances, and complete living and dining areas. The largest option, the 10x30 unit, is about the size of a one-and-a-half car garage and provides ample room for everything from a 5-bedroom home, including large appliances, TVs, various sofas, dining sets, bedroom furniture, and several large boxes.\n\niStorage Self Storage FAQ\n\nDo I need Insurance?\n\nYes, insurance is a requirement for any storage unit. If you have homeowners or renter's insurance, it may also extend to your storage unit. Please check your coverage with your agent to see whether storage coverage is included or can be added to your policy. If you do not have your insurance, we require SBOA Tenant Insurance for your items. It is recommended that customers utilize our plan even if they are using their homeowners or renter's policy, as it prevents your insurance premiums from going up in the event of a claim and pays out prior to insurance claims.\n\nIs Month to Month Leasing Offered?\n\nAll leases we offer are month-to-month. Whether you only need storage for a month or longer, there is no need to sign an additional lease to accommodate a greater need. Stay for as long as you will need storage without fear of lengthy commitments. While you are welcome to utilize your storage unit for less than a month, prepayment of one month is required and will not be prorated if your use is less than one month.\n\nWhat documents do I need to reserve a storage unit?\n\nA valid driver's license or Government-issued photo ID is required to rent a unit.\n\nIs There Anything I Can't Store?\n\nCertain items cannot be stored in your storage unit at ANY time. Here is the following list of things:\n\nPerishables\n\nFood Items, including canned/sealed goods – even water bottles\n\nAnimals\n\nStolen Property\n\nHazardous or Flammable Materials\n\nDrugs\n\nExplosives/Firearms/Ammunition\n\nUnregistered Vehicles\n\nPeople/Yourself, i.e., seeking shelter from a storage unit\n\nAnything Illegal\n\nHow can I pay my rent each month for my storage unit?\n\nWe offer many convenient ways to pay at our locations: automatic payments can be set up, credit card, and cash; online, in-person, and phone payments.\n\nWhat is the difference between access hours and office hours?\n\nAccess hours are when our customers can access their units and either load or unload them. Office hours are the hours our office is open for business. Things that you may need during office hours include rent payment – should you opt to pay in person – purchase of additional moving supplies, and transferring or vacating a unit."
