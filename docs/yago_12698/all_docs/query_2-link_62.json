        "text": "I came for work but wished I stayed for leisure, this hotel has a lot to offer! Every staff member spoke perfect English, which helped as I speak only a little Spanish. There are US outlets in the rooms and the hotel provides adapters/converters if needed. I really enjoyed the artist decor, the lounge and pool area are beautiful. I stayed on a Sunday to Tuesday and found it to be very quiet, noting I was on the sixth floor (out of 7). We enjoyed food and drinks on the terrace with a large group and the staff was excellent. I also enjoyed room service as I didn’t have time to come down for breakfast.\n\nMy favorite part of this hotel is the shower - very spacious with the rain style shower head. The water gets very hot and great water pressure. After 15 hours of travel from Boston, a hot shower was amazing.\n\nI hope to come back and try the pool and spa services!\n\nRead more\n\nWe stayed at the Faena very recently and had a very nice experience. The hotel is located in a great part of Buenos Aires and in a very walkable and safe location – plenty of restaurant choices close-by and for tourists like us, an easy walk to the main part of Buenos Aires. Rooms were great and the check-in was efficient with a sit down with a person – more akin to something you would see in a resort type of a location and not one in the middle of a metropolis.\n\nZero issues with room cleaning services. The food at Italfast was beyond expectations with excellent quality and taste – we are both vegetarian and their attention to our specific requests was very commendable. I must say that the breakfast at the Mercado was just okay – more “plain” but certainly efficient.\n\nThe hotel reached out to us well prior to our stay to enquire about Airport pick-ups and they stayed on top of it as our flights were cancelled three times (ridiculous, I know!).\n\nRead more\n\nThe Faena hotel is a stunning building with stunning decor. That’s really all there is to say positively.\n\nWe stayed there for 3 nights and everyday we were made to feel like we didn’t belong there by the staff despite staying in a suite.\n\nWhilst La Roja show is seen as one of the best in BA, it’s definitely not worth 260USD per person. When we booked we were not advised of the price only to find out upon checkout (we assumed 260USD was the total price) and had I known it’s cost, doubt we would have gone. It’s really not worth that.\n\nWe were running late one evening and asked the concierge to call ahead and advise the restaurant we would be late. His tone was off with us. In the end he didn’t and we lost our table having to wait for another.\n\nThe prices at Faena are incredible and if you don’t mind paying 8USD for a can of Diet Coke, then this place is for you.\n\nDefinitely pretentious, definitely beautiful but definitely not worth it.\n\nVery disappointing indeed\n\nRead more\n\nThe hotel is located in an upscale and pleasant neighborhood. Its staff are generally very courteous and obliging.\n\nTaste is very subjective. Whilst the Hotel and its rooms are very opulently furnished I find the thick red velvet curtains and dark corridors everywhere oppressive. There isn't even a writing desk in the room. Switches are not quite within reach from the bed because there is a fairly wide gap between the beds and wall switches.... You need long arms to reach them. There isn't even a kettle in the room for me to make tea. Housekeeping was obliging to bring me one when I requested for it.\n\nIt is so impractical to have the WC and bidet as separate units.\n\nMy room (level 4) was unfortunately below or near to the Hotel bar. Of the 3 nights that I stayed there was a life band was performing (presumably at the bar) for 2 nights, It usually ends before midnight. So, I couldn't get to bed till past midnight. An unpleasant experience.\n\nRead more\n\nWe were meant to have visited pre pandemic and were really excited to finally make it here. However, despite the opulent foyer area, the rest of the hotel is tired and the bar staff and restaurant staff were lack lustre, bordering on complete disinterest.\n\nWe were “upgraded” but apart from there being extra space, we were in fact given a disused apartment. The shower had masking tape holding it to the wall, shower curtain hanging off it’s rail, curtains hanging off, no USB ports and extremely poor wifi connectivity. We did alert the reception staff and the door handle and shower holder was repaired.\n\nThe service in the room was inconsistent with towels not being replaced, turn down service not being done each evening and shower gel/shampoo not being replenished.\n\nGetting into the Library bar should have been easy as hotel guests, however our room numbers were requested numerous times.\n\nAll things considered, the experience was tiring as it is tedious having to request things that should be provided automatically.\n\nIf you’re considering a trip to Buenos Aires, do yourselves a favour and look elsewhere.\n\nRead more\n\nWe had read reviews on the Tango Show at the Faena and decided to book in and stay. Our time in Argentina was coming to an end and we wanted to finish it on a high note.\n\nThe Tango show was fantastic and the 4 course dinner exceeded our expectations. Wine and soft drinks are included which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe hotel as a Miami vibe, it looks very opulent on entering and the door guys are very keen and want to make sure you are staying on arrival.\n\nOur room was not ready and so we went for a lunch in the El Mercado ( hotel restaurant). Initially the service was good , we ordered starters but didn’t want to rush and asked the waiter to come back after we had had our starters before ordering our main. We ordered fish which was very disappointing and then basically we didn’t see our waiter again. We had to ask another member of staff for the bill and then another to pay. All the young staff were busy talking and no one said anything as we left. Not what we expected from the Faena!\n\nOnce past the entrance you soon realize that the Faena is in need of a revamp. The hallways are dingy and unwelcoming.\n\nOur corner suite was spacious, old, in need of fresh paint and it had a peculiar banging noise?\n\nThe bedding was fresh and felt nice.\n\n2 complimentary coffee pods, a kettle( no tea),no milk, no bottled water meant we had to ask for more with milk.\n\nThe fridge was full of offerings that you could purchase including water!\n\nWe had a few incidents that were dealt with quickly and professionally ( tub wouldn’t fill and wifi was poor).\n\nAfter the show we popped in the hotel bar for a drink ( apparently we needed to book?) but strongly told the waitress that we were staying at the hotel and she politely found us a spot.\n\nThe biggest delight was the singer Angela Navarro, Wow she made our night. Absolutely amazing!\n\nIt’s a long review but to sum it up.\n\nThe rooms are not five star for the price you pay but the Tango Show ( which was $250 each extra) and the Club bar made it a five star experience.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Feina hotel and staff is a 10 in almost every category. We love the corner room and have stayed many times and will return. Our waitress, Maru, in the exquisit bar was delightful as was Danielle in the Bistro restaurant. The Consierge team goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.\n\nThe Tango Rojo show is excellent and very authentic. Although at $260 PP, it is double what other tango shows sell for.\n\nHowever, I reduced my rating because of the horrible music in their fine dining Bistro restaurant. The food, service and ambiance was fantastic. But the loud God awful music made us want to run out of the restaurant with our hair on fire. We were the only guests in the restaurant and we were told it could be turned down, but not off. We were told many guests have complained before about the noise, I mean music.\n\nIf loud screaming music is your thing , you might enjoy it. Obviously management has been told many times, so the General Manager must not care.\n\nWhoever is in charge of the music should be fired.\n\nRead more"
