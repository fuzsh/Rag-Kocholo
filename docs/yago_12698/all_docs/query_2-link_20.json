Come morning, the double height ceilings and fine arched windows ensure a long-lasting embrace from the sun, while the New York-style bathroom tiling is equally welcoming. * Please be aware, that my Loft can accommodate up to 4 guests, but 2 would be using floor mattresses. As a welcome gift, I am including a few coffee pods, sugar / sweetener and a bottled water. With its double height windows, our loft is bathed in morning sunlight and very lumunious throughout the day. Based on our love for cooking, despite the kitchen's size which is compact, we made sure it is very complete with a gas oven, microwave, fridge, plates and cutlery for you to enjoy a glass of a good Malbec and a homemade meal after a day discovering this fabulous city. (you are 2 squares away from \"Mercado de San Telmo\" with plenty of fresh produce) The mezzanine bedroom, reached by a spiral staircase, has 2 twin size beds that can be converted easily into a king size bed , and 2 extra mattresses for 2 more guests. The bathroom has been fully remodeled with New York style tiles, shower/tub, and an separate wash basin. You will have access to the whole Loft Though we live about 1 hour out of town, we are always available and very happy to advise and help you in any way for a really enjoyable stay. San Telmo is the oldest and most traditional quarter of Buenos Aires, retaining its architectural heritage and cobbled streets. Nowadays, the area is also well known for its bars, restaurants, weekend street fair, and many antiques galleries. We highly recommend walking around the neighborhood, so as to enjoy the 19th century constructions and their very precious details. For larger distances, you can choose from buses, subway and taxis. As additional info, you are also in walking distance to Puerto Madero with all its restaurants and nightlife and to Colonia Express for day cruises to Colonia del Uruguay, which by the way, we highly reccomend.\n\nRental unit in Palermo\n\n4.98 out of 5 average rating, 237 reviews4.98 (237)\n\nBeautiful Recoleta Apartment with French Balcony\n\nPerfect place for those who love green areas, museums, elegant residences, sophisticated decoration. The neighborhood is plenty of embassies, iconic monuments, and museums, and it is close to the heart of Recoleta. Public transportation (trains and buses) are available at walking distance. Ezeiza airport (international) is one hour in average from the apartment by taxi, and J. Newbery airport (national) is 20 minutes by taxi. It's important to mention that the building do not have elevators, so you will have to step two floors by staircase. The housekeeper will be in charge of the check-in and check-out and she will be available for helping the guests in whatever they need. Additionally, she will be able to make extra cleaning services (full cleaning to the apartment, washing dishes, refresh of sheets and towels, etc.) subject to previous guests request to the host (Guillermo) by AirBnb app. The extra cost is US$40 per day. This area of Recoleta is on the edge of an upmarket area called \"La Isla\". The apartment is half a block from the National Library and in front of the Book and Language Museum. There are also some great neighbourhood restaurants not far away. Av Las Heras is an artery with a great variety of buses that can take you to any part of the city safely and at low cost (on the desk of the bedroom you will find SUBE cards, which you can charge money in a kiosk located in Tagle between Pagano and Libertador - Please leave them in the same place when retiring) Also the apartment is located to three blocks from the underground Las Heras station (Line H) that connects with all the network of \"subtes\" of Buenos Aires. For taxi use, I recommend using the Uber or Cabify applications. Mr. Arnaldo Duarte is the doorman of the building, he counts with my all trust and he will be able to collaborate with the guests needs as well. The apartment is equipped with a safe-box in the closet of the bedroom, instructions to use it will be provided by the host (Guillermo) directly by email, wapp, or txts (reserved information) after the guest request."
