        "text": "The chapter addresses a review of the episode of the naval expedition commanded by Julius Caesar in 61 B.C. on the Atlantic coasts of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, which ended with the conquest of Brigantium, in the Bay of A Coruña. It is an episode that culminates the military activities of his mandate as governor of Hispania Ulterior, and in which both economic and symbolic components have been identified. This contribution delves into the symbolic aspects of Caesar’s initiative, within the framework of his relationship with the Balbii, with the city of Gades and with its patron god, Heracles-Melqart, whose sanctuary he visited in 68 B.C., during his quaestorship in Hispania Ulterior. Gades’ contribution to the expedition would not be restricted to the fleet transporting Caesar to Brigantium, but would extend to the Phoenician conceptions of the western boundaries of the world, and the role of Brigantium as an extreme and singular place in the Phoenician geography. Furthermore, we propose a valuation of Phoenician components as key inspiration for the Caesarean feat, linked to the mythology of the Herakles-Melqart of Gades as a god who defeats the forces of chaos in the confines of the world.\n\nWhat follows will begin by introducing the two writers who are our subjects (Peter Martyr d'Anghleria and Francisco Cervantes de Salazar) before we consider their varied approaches to the indigenous settlements of the Caribbean and Mesoamerica. Their accounts of these villages and cities will then be contrasted with their depictions of Spanish urban foundations. This examination reveals how the Roman colonial city could be used to understand the cities of the New World and to model Spanish imperialism in these lands. This in turn demonstrates the usefulness of the ancient city as a tool for thinking about colonial cities in later centuries\n\nClaims for the existence of lost cities represent a problematic form of pseudoarchaeology. If an archaeologist insists the city does not exist, then they are closed minded. Or instead, if the archaeologist goes looking for a city and fails to find it, they have not looked hard enough. Once such legends exist, they develop a pernicious hold on popular perceptions of the ancient world. This article examines British explorer Percy Fawcett's claim that a lost city exists in the heart of the Amazon jungle, and argues that the best way to overcome pseudoarchaeological claims for lost cities is not to dismiss them but to openly discuss how the legends originated and developed. Resumen: Las afirmaciones defendiendo la existencia de ciudades perdidas son una forma problemática de pseudoarqueología. Si un arqueólogo insiste que la ciudad no existe, es acusado de tener una mente cerrada. Si, en su lugar, el arqueólogo va en busca de la ciudad y no logra hallarla, es acusado de no buscar lo suficiente. Una vez dichas leyendas existen, logran arraigarse en las percepciones populares del mundo antiguo. Este artículo examina las afirmaciones del explorador británico Percy Fawcett acerca de la existencia de una ciudad perdida en el corazón de la Amazonia. Se defenderá que la mejor forma de superar afirmaciones acerca de ciudades perdidas desde la pseudoarqueología es no desecharlas, sino discutir abiertamente cómo dichas leyendas se originaron y desarrollaron."
