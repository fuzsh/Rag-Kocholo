        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€” The Hornets have announced centre Al Jefferson has exercised the third-year option on his contract and will remain with the team next season.\n\nThe 11-year NBA veteran will make $13.5 million in the final year of his deal.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 289-pound Jefferson said after the regular season he planned to remain with the Hornets because there was \"unfinished business\" to attend to after the Charlotte failed to make the playoffs.\n\nJefferson struggled with injuries last season and appeared in 65 games, averaging 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.3 blocks in 30.6 minutes.\n\nThat came on the heels of his best NBA season ever in 2013-14 when he was named third team All-NBA after averaging 21.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in his first year in Charlotte."
