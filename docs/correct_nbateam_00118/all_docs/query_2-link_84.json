        "text": "NBA free agency is less than 24 hours old, and the Indiana Pacers have made their first move.\n\nThe Pacers have agreed to a three-year, $30 million deal with free agent center Al Jefferson, the IndyStar has confirmed. The news was first reported by The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski. The move means the end of Ian Mahinmi's tenure in Indianapolis, according to IndyStar Pacers Insider Nate Taylor.\n\nJefferson starred at Prentiss High from 2000-04, averaging 42.6 points per game as a senior.\n\nJefferson, 31, played just 47 games last season (18 starts) for Charlotte and lost his starting spot to former IU standout Cody Zeller. Jefferson's minutes played and points scored were his lowest since 2006. He averaged 12.0 points and 6.4 rebounds for the Hornets this past season and was suspended in December for five games for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program.\n\nAfter the Hornets lost in Game 7 of the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs,Jefferson said he wanted to return to Charlotte to finish his career.\n\n\"There is nowhere I would rather be,\" Jefferson said on May 2. \"The things that we have done with this franchise the last three years have been amazing and I want to continue to see it through. But there is a business side to it, but I would like to end my career here.\"\n\nThe move continues a reshaping of the Pacers roster, which will include newcomers Jeff Teague and Thaddeus Young, both acquired via trade prior to last week's NBA draft. Jefferson will likely serve as the team's backup center behind last year's first-round pick Myles Turner.\n\nJefferson, who entered the NBA straight out of high school, has played 12 pro seasons, spending time with Boston, Minnesota, Utah and Charlotte. For his career, he's averaged 16.7 points and 8.9 rebounds a game."
