        "text": "Feel free to take points if you disagree, but at least contribute to the discussion.\n\nEveryone knows that Al Jefferson is on the trading block. And according to at least one user on this site, the Warriors are interested in him. Now I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why…\n\nJefferson is a good player in the right system; that system is clearly not the Warriors. Take the problems Jefferson had with the Wolves and double them when you add him on the Warriors; he’s slow, cannot play transition D well, and is only an average defender. The Wolves had the 3rd fastest pace in the NBA last season; their defense was the second worst in the league, and Jefferson was a big part of that. The Warriors have the fastest pace in the NBA, and Don Nelson is likely to return; they will probably still have the fastest pace next year as well. Would Jefferson fit well with them if he didn’t fit well in Minnesota?\n\nJefferson needs to go on a half-court oriented team, not a fast break, run and gun team. If GS trades for him, it’d be a big mistake; he has a bad contract, and if you put Maggette and Jefferson on the floor together, you might as well have two black holes who don’t pass and take bad shots. What do the rest of you think?\n\nBy the way, if anyone can find a link of GS’s apparent interest in Jefferson, it would be great.\n\nI brought up points to show that I’m obviously not the only person who disagrees with you. Apparently 2507 times other people have disagreed with something you have said to the point where they took a point from you. I don’t know how else to put it. I mean your reasoning for the warriors acquiring Jefferson was ‘they need a big plain and simple.” I’m guessing it doesn’t matter who? Like burningflood says, he stops offensive flow and had good scoring (and only scoring numbers) on a bad team. If you knew as much as you claim you’d realize that don nelson has coached this up an down tempo without a true big or a guy such as Jefferson ALL HIS CAREER. what maes you believe that he’ll all of a sudden change? The warriors have stuck with Nelson because for nearly 2 decades they had no history of winning. Then Nelson cones sling and they make it to the pkayoffs and even win a series against a 67 win Dallas team no less. So the warriors organization thought it would be a good idea to stick with that gameplan hoping they could win and sell tickets. The winning stopped after that season and hasn’t been happening fir them since that season. If they were going to change their style they wouldve either fired Nelson or told him to step down but they haven’t. It makes ABSOLUTELY no sense for them to get him or even attempt getting him. As for the ‘talent’ they have. I feel like both curry and Ellis are going through prolonged tryouts in golden state to win a spot on a team that will pay them more money. Unless they were to be off the bench and used fir instant scoring they won’t be effective. Kevin Martin is able to be instant offense as a starter because f his build. He’s long and tall so he starts because at least on defense he’s not giving up a whole lot. Curry and Ellis are both short and curry isn’t athletic at all. I’d love either one off my bench fir scoring but wouldn’t want either starting if I was trying to win a championship. Jefferson makes no sense here.\n\n1-The Wolves sucked when Jefferson scored.\n\nI’d check to see if he scored at an efficient pace in those games where he scored large numbers of points, or if he just had high usage, chucked up a bunch of shots, and happened to make some of them, while taking away better looks from his teammates.\n\n2-“I saud ‘takent’ because theyvdibt have any.” – i honestly have no idea what you mean here.\n\nI think he meant, “I said ‘talent’ because they didn’t have any,” referring to the idea that Golden State has a roster devoid of talent, that Ellis and Curry are not talented, and that Jefferson wouldn’t fit because he isn’t considered a talent in a system like Golden State’s, and that Jefferson just isn’t that great of a player.\n\n3-Integrating a big man into the offense\n\nJefferson’s the kind of guy that you integrate by running plays for–plays where he promptly tries to take on the double team and scores at a lower rate while the other players stand around, getting ready to run back on defense. That’s the kind of player that he is…he believes that he’s a first option, and so does not pass out of the double team. Besides, offense is only half the game. If you were to integrate Jefferson on offense to offset his excessive defensive woes in the run and gun game, you’d have to replace almost every player on the GS roster with players that play well in half court sets. And you’d have to figure out how to deal with faster teams, teams against which Jefferson becomes a big liability.\n\nI actually disagree with both of you.\n\nSacphil, I think that Curry is a talent; sure, he might not be particularly athletic, but neither is Nash, and Curry has the shot and the IQ of a Nash. Maybe the bar is set rather high, but I think that Curry has the right character, the right mentality, and the right work ethic to pull it off. Ellis, on the other hand, is a talent in the right situation; in GS, however, he does not have the right situation. If Ellis could be shipped off to Philly, for example, I think that the Holiday-Ellis backcourt doesn’t have too much of a defensive problem. Ellis matches up with opposing PGs, and Holiday guards the SGs. Holiday is a good defender, and Ellis can guard well if he isn’t outmatched in terms of size.\n\nLlperez, I’d love it if the Warriors even made the playoffs, let alone won anything there. That’s a problem that we haven’t encountered often…the Warriors have made the playoffs just once in the last 16 years, and so even sniffing the playoffs in the ultracompetitive Western Conference would make me somewhat happy. And about the 20+ wins…last year was just a really, really bad year for the Warriors in terms of injury. We had multiple games where we dressed the league minimum of players, 3 of whom were D-Leaguers who stuck on the roster (Hunter, Tolliver, Williams)…our big men were injured early and often (Randolph, Wright, Biedrins, Turiaf) to the point where scrubs like Devean George had to play big minutes…I think that we were a 35-38 win team at least last year, and it all went downhill precisely because of injuries…we’re not quite as bad as our record indicated. Jefferson can’t carry the team, as shown in Minnesota; in fact, I think he’d make us even worse, because he would either be playing limited minutes or he would be slowing down the pace and making the other players ineffective. At the very worst, he could make the team question its identity–like the 76ers or the T-Wolves this year. The two different playing styles don’t mesh together at all.\n\nOh, and a guy who can get to the free throw line and get easy buckets? Mr.Corey Maggette is such a player…and he’s a black hole on offence and a liability on defense. Hm…is Jefferson any better, just because he is ‘an elite low post scorer’ if he has the same problems? Maybe, but how many more wins would he generate?\n\nburningflood, thank you for bringing actual bball talk to the table instead of just trashing me and saying my opinion doesnt count because im a laker fan lacking points.\n\nas for your talk, i will say this. the warriors have some very serious things going for them. That left handed dude who joined them late in the season is a serious threat. He is much more than just the product of the warriors system or late season flexibility for rookies. That guy can play. The warriors have plenty of offense and need defense. There are a number of ways to approach that. Personlly, depending on what they would have to give up, jefferson would be a solid addition. Even though he requires the team to slow down, doesnt mean the team always has to slow down. Bedrins could still run and they could still be primarily a transition team. Jefferson could be the the other option when the game slows down and they dont have to make everything fit him.\n\nWarriors have a great backcourt and i cant see how any good coach couldnt figure out a way to incorparate a quality big man like jefferson. Again, a lot of this depends on what we are talking about them giving up since this is a hypothetical trade.\n\nsaying al jefferson is a bad defender and is going to get worse if he goes to golden state because they play faster isn’t a very good point……you can say the same about 95% of the players in the nba…. the faster you play on offense the worst you will be on defense, thats common sense because you can’t get back and get set.fact is a team is going to be bottom feeders if you play such an uptempo game. the players are too skilled not to pick you apart. the only team it works for is pheonix. thats because they arguably the point guard with the best court vision in the nba in steve nash and he can find open players to knock down the open shots.and they have amare who is a terror down low every 2nd game or so. and they have great shooters. as long as you have don nelson as the coach.the team isn;t goin far, and regarldess of who you add they’re goin to be exposed on defense because of the system thats played. yes its fun and entertaining to watch but its never going to translate to a significant playoff run."
