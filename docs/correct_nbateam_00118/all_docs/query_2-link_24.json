        "text": "CLEVELAND – Amid the chaos that envelopes a locker room after a Game 7 loss, Al Jefferson evades the microphones and cameras, grabs himself a plate to take on the Pacers’ trip home and dips out.\n\nAlmost no one notices the 6-10 center. Not even teammates who are smarting for a first-round elimination to LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday, 105-101.\n\nJefferson didn’t break a sweat in the seven-game series to end Indiana’s run. That’s because he didn’t make an appearance. Still, he was in the trenches with them.\n\nOn Game 7 and the future:\n\nDoyel: LeBron and Cavs get this one but moment coming for Pacers, Victor Oladipo\n\nInsider: With Victor Oladipo at the helm, Pacers pivot to bright future after Game 7 loss to Cavs\n\n“I thought that we played a great series. Lack of experience played a part in some of the games but that’s stuff we’re going to get better at and grow,” said Jefferson, who lost his spot to Domantas Sabonis after being Myles Turner’s backup center in 2016-17. “Overall it was great. Them young boys fought from the beginning to the end.”\n\nIn playing a career-low 36 games, Jefferson averaged 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds. When teammates spoke in glowing terms about how they had the best professional experience of their careers, Jefferson had much to do with it.\n\nThe good vibes were contagious as he never complained about taking a back seat to a second-year player. The first person president Kevin Pritchard mentions when talking about his team's magical run heading into the postseason?\n\nAl Jefferson.\n\nWhen the Pacers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by Cleveland one year ago, Jefferson didn’t make an appearance either. Coach Nate McMillan kept him on the bench despite him playing in 66 regular-season games.\n\nThen came the trade for Victor Oladipo and Sabonis, sending Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“Al Jefferson has been unbelievable,” said McMillan of his 14-year veteran. “Al Jefferson came here to play. When we made the trade for Domantas and Victor, Al is all of a sudden bumped out of the rotation. He’s been, I would say, the most important player on the team because of his approach. His sacrifice to allow these young guys to play and develop and in working with them.”\n\nThe final year of Jefferson’s three-year deal isn’t fully guaranteed for 2018-19. No matter what happens, he intends to keep playing in a league that has been moving away from traditional, mid-range shooting bigs like him. He’ll have value because Jefferson can play and has a good reputation.\n\n“I’m going to try to do a couple more seasons before I think about that,” the 33-year-old said of retirement.\n\nFree agency, which has been a trouble spot for this franchise in terms of landing game-changing talent, opens in July.\n\nFree agents typically seek to maximize their earnings and join not just a team with a winning record but one that has a legitimate chance to advance deep into the postseason.\n\nThe 48-win regular season and pushing LeBron James to Game 7 in the first round could do the trick for the Pacers, who also should have wiggle room under the cap. If James were to leave the division or the conference in free agency himself that would only enhance the outlook.\n\n“I think so. Guys want to win,” Jefferson said of the franchise's free agency prospects. “You’ll be surprised how much other players scout other teams and see the things that they do and the culture they got. I think that does play a big part. That’s one of the reasons I decided to come here. They way they do things, how they do it, how they fight and play hard.”\n\nIf that is the case, July will be more interesting than ever."
