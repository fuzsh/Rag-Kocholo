        "text": "Russ Isabella-US PRESSWIRE\n\nThe Utah Jazz have a cloud looming over their season that is larger than simply incorporating the newly acquired Williamses (Mo and Maurice), Randy Foye and Kevin Murphy into Tyrone Corbin's system. The front office is going to need to choose between their two veteran big men, Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap, this season, and they need to do so soon.\n\nThough predicting the paths NBA teams will have is always cloudy at best, the chance of the 2013-2014 Utah Jazz roster mirroring its current version is around one in 1,000.\n\nAt the end of this season both Al Jefferson's ($15 million) and Paul Millsap's ($8.6 million) contracts are set to expire, and with young studs Derrick Favors and Enes Kanter waiting in the shadows, there is little time to waste.\n\nGiven Al Jefferson's ability to score at a high frequency anywhere within 12 feet of the paint, and with Paul Millsap's blue-collar work ethic and ever-increasing repertoire of shots, they are going to be some of the gems available to other teams at the end of the season. If the Jazz simply wait and hope they can re-sign these two players (which would be a questionable decision anyway given Favors and Kanter's potential), they are going to lose out on valuable trade assets.\n\nUtah's roster is certainly more balanced after adding some proven three-point shooters to their lineup, particular Foye, who is knocking down nearly half of his long-range shots (46.4 percent), but adding additional depth to the backcourt may be what the Jazz management decide to do with the trading chips they have on the table.\n\nThis certainly is not something they need to move on this week, but if they intend on making a run into the playoffs (fingers crossed), it is best to make these changes early and let the team gel throughout the season."
