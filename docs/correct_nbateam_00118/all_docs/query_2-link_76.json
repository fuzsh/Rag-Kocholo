        "text": "Regardless of how this series turns out for the Bobcats, what’s the upside for this team considering the salary cap room, the number of draft picks and securing a head coach in Steve Clifford? A: I would say the future is bright and I think it started with the Al Jefferson deal, a deal a lot of people questioned. He’s given them an anchor on their front line offensively, especially on a team that doesn’t shoot it well. I like Kemba Walker. I think he’s definitely a guy that he will be a guy you can rely on to be the starting point guard for many years to come.\n\nThat would be the Charlotte Bobcats, led by 6’10”, 289-pound Al Jefferson, who was recently named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for March after averaging 24.7 points, 10.6 rebounds and shooting 55.5 percent from the field. So far this month, he’s even better at 26.6 points and 13.7 rebounds for the 42-39 Bobcats, who are back in the playoffs for the first time in four years. “My main goal right now is to turn the Bobcats into one of the elite teams in the East,” Jefferson said. “I think that from the beginning, the respect that we now have is great, but I think it’s just the beginning of something special.”\n\nJefferson, who also finishes strong with a 5.2 fourth-quarter points average, said he has to be craftier now that he’s older. He said he even “shocks” himself with some of the moves he pulls off. “This is the best I’ve felt in my career just because of the experience I’ve got now,” said Jefferson, who has a league-high 832 post-up plays (nearly one point per play, according to Synergy Sports). “The game is a lot slower to me than it was when I was younger. I understand and see things a lot clearer now than I did before—and guys are learning how to play with me, and I’m learning how to play with him. We’ve just got to continue to get stops. We’re a good running team when we get stops.”"
