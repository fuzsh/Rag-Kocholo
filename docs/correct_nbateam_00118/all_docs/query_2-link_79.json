        "text": "\"When I go home, it feels good to hear people let me know how proud of me they are of me,\" Jefferson said, \"because they all talked about me when I went to Charlotte. They thought I was just crazy.\"\n\nOne year later, Jefferson's decision has been validated on several fronts. Jefferson, who led the Charlotte to its first playoffs appearance since 2008, was named All-NBA Third Team on Wednesday, the first time he received the honor in his 10-year career.\n\nJefferson was not named an All-Star this year, but earned the All-NBA spot because his performance trended upward throughout the year.\n\nJefferson started the season with an ankle injury and showed lingering effects early in the season. Still, he managed averages of 20.1 points and 10.5 rebounds in the first half of the year. His post All-Star numbers cemented Wednesday's recognition, however, as he put up 24.5 points and 11.4 rebounds in the midst of Charlotte's playoff push.\n\n\"I can sit and say it doesn't, but it does,\" Jefferson said of being named All-NBA. \"To get this type of recognition right now, at this point of my career, it means a lot. I'm going to use it as motivation and just continue to keep building and keep going.\"\n\nSome of that will depend on Jefferson's health and his ability to lure other players to Charlotte. Jefferson was recruited by point guard Kemba Walker, and he could take on a similar role as the face of the franchise.\n\nJefferson's plantar fasciia, which he tore during the NBA playoffs, is first priority, however. Jefferson played through pain with the help of shots in the injured left foot, but he took three weeks off once the Miami Heat defeated his team in four games.\n\nWhile he has yet to return to basketball activity, Jefferson does intend to get on the treadmill tomorrow. He no longer feels pain in the foot and has not worn a boot on it foot since the season ended.\n\n\"They said what I did in the game is what a doctor would do if I had surgery,\" Jefferson said, describing the clean tear of his plantar fasciia. \"I just needed to rest right after that. As we know, I couldn't.\n\n\"That's why we did what we had to do to get it well enough for me to play. But as soon as the season was over with, I didn't do nothing for three weeks and every day you could tell the increase I had.\"\n\nAs he has worked through the process of rehabbing, Jefferson also fielded calls from other players. The progress made last season created interest, and Jefferson said folks started to reach out to him with two months left in the season â€” and they haven't stopped.\n\n\"I had guys last year who came to me and said they could see themselves coming here,\" Jefferson said. \"I had guys call me and ask, 'How is the coach?' They wanted me to confirm what they've been hearing about how great Coach (Steve Clifford) is.\"\n\nCharlotte has reached the point where players want to come here, but it was not long ago that the franchise was at the pit of the NBA.\n\nBefore Jefferson decided to join the Bobcats franchise, which has now transitioned to the Hornets name, the roster was filled with inexperienced lottery picks who had recently played through a season in which they posted the worst win percentage in NBA history.\n\nBut he took a leap of faith, and a decision that once appeared questionable doesn't seem so bad now.\n\n\"When I signed here, I had a feeling,\" Jefferson said. \"I had a feeling we would buy into coach's system and myself coming in and being dedicated to improving on the defensive end. We had a chance to do something special, and we did.\n\n\"And to look back it, we have come a long way. But I think most important thing for me is not to be happy about what we have done or what I have done.\""
