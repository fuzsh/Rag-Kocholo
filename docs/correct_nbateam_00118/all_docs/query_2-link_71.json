        "text": "On May 15, 2003, Stephen Jackson experienced one of the highlights of his long NBA career. He was in his third year in the league and a starting forward for the San Antonio Spurs when they faced the three-time reigning champion Los Angeles Lakers in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals at Staples Center, the Lakers’ home floor. The Spurs were the top seed, but the Lakers had the sport’s best duo in Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant and had never lost a playoff series in the building.\n\nStill, that night, the Spurs ended the Lakers’ dynasty, cruising to a 110-82 victory and knocking them out of the playoffs. The next month, the Spurs won the NBA championship, giving Jackson his first (and only) title.\n\nOn Sunday, Jackson will be competing again at Staples Center. But instead of playing in the NBA postseason, the 41-year-old will be vying for the championship in the BIG3, a summer three-on-three league that was founded in 2017 by rapper/actor/entrepreneur Ice Cube and longtime music and entertainment executive Jeff Kwatinetz. The games are played in a half-court setting in major arenas throughout the country, with the first team to score 50 points declared the winner, as long as they win by two points.\n\nJackson, a 14-year NBA veteran, is captain of the Killer 3’s and its leading scorer, averaging 13.9 points per game. His teammates include former NBA players Josh Powell, C.J. Watson and Eddy Curry. Charles Oakley, the former New York Knicks great who played in the NBA for 19 seasons before retiring in 2004, is their coach.\n\nThe Killer 3’s finished last in the BIG3’s inaugural season two years ago and placed fifth in the eight-team league last year, missing the playoffs. This season, they finished tied for second in the regular season with a 5-3 record. Last weekend, they defeated reigning champion Power, 50-42, in the postseason opener behind Jackson and former Syracuse player Donte Greene, who each had 13 points, and Watson, who added 12.\n\nThat victory clinched the Killer 3’s berth in Sunday’s championship game, where they will face the Triplets, one of the league’s four expansion teams this season. The Triplets went 7-1 in the regular season and knocked off the 3-Headed Monsters, 50-39, in the playoffs last weekend.\n\nJoe Johnson, a seven-time NBA All-Star, has emerged as the Triplets’ (and the league’s) top player. He was named the BIG3’s Most Valuable Player after leading the league with 21.9 points and 3.9 assists per game in the regular season and finishing third with 7.5 rebounds per game. He was unstoppable again last weekend, scoring 26 points with five rebounds and three assists against the 3-Headed Monsters.\n\nJohnson is the Triplets’ captain, while 14-year NBA veteran center Al Jefferson is its co-captain. Teammates Jannero Pargo, Jamario Moon and Alan Anderson each played at least five NBA seasons, too. Lisa Leslie, a three-time WNBA MVP and Naismith Hall of Famer, is the Triplets’ coach. She was named the BIG3 coach of the year.\n\nThe Killer 3’s and Triplets have not played each other this season, but their players are well aware of each other considering their shared NBA experiences. The players may be past their prime, but Johnson and Jackson, in particular, are adept at the half-court game. It’s not exactly the NBA playoffs. Still, Sunday’s game will provide fans with some nostalgia and a chance to watch recognizable names compete for a championship."
