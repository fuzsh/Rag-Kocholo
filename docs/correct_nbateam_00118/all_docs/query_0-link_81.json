        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY â€” Former Utah Jazz center Al Jefferson will sign a 3-year contract with the Charlotte Bobcats worth an estimated $41 million, according to ESPN's Marc Stein. The contract includes a player opt-out clause after the second season. The deal cannot become official until July 10.\n\nJefferson played three seasons with the Jazz, arriving from Minnesota in July 2010 in exchange for the rights to Kosta Koufos and two draft picks. Despite putting up elite offensive numbers with the Jazz, Jefferson was often criticized by fans for his defensive deficiencies. In Charlotte, Jefferson is poised to be the star of the perennially cellar-dwelling team owned by Michael Jordan.\n\nThe 28-year-old center was the focus of the Jazz offense during his tenure, especially after the abrupt departure of Jerry Sloan and Deron Williams in February of 2011. Though well-liked by teammates and coaches, the plodding Jefferson-centric offense was never embraced by a majority of fans.\n\nThe Jefferson signing surprised many who expected him to wait and see where fellow free agent Dwight Howard would sign. Jefferson was poised to be a prime second option for teams that missed out on Howard."
