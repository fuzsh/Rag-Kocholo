        "text": "NBA players are big guys, both in terms of height, weight, and general presence. In practice, that means that very basic products in their life need to be special-ordered. Most department stores don't make suits for giants, for instance, and if a 7-footer wants to ride a bike he better find a special manufacturer (that might not keep people from stealing it, of course). That goes for beds, too — a king size won't necessarily fit a member of the Sacramento Kings. So, in order to be comfortable, an NBA athlete might need to get a custom-made bed.\n\nOn Tuesday, we learned just how large that bed needs to be. New Utah Jazz guard Mo Williams tweeted this photo of teammate Al Jefferson's bed (via TBJ), a huge piece of furniture that would seem to fit a normal-sized family of five, plus several pets. Spencer Ryan Hall of Jazz blog Salt City Hoops found out that the bed is 10-by-12 feet, or large enough to fit two normal-sized grizzly bears and a Mini Cooper. Jefferson is listed at 6-10 and 289 pounds, but a quick look at him suggests he's a bit shorter. He needs a big bed, obviously, but this particular choice seems a little extreme.\n\n[Related: Kobe Bryant drops hints on retirement date]\n\nHowever, the size arguably isn't the most shocking thing about the bed. After the jump, check out another photo from Hall to see the exorbitant price tag for this item:\n\nYes, that's more than $23,000 for a single item of furniture. By comparison, a top-of-the-line Tempur-Pedic king-size bed runs over $9,000 retail, or roughly $14,000 less than Jefferson's bed. Don't worry, he can afford it — Jefferson is set to make $15 million in salary this season and should get another sizable deal as a free agent next summer.\n\nKeep in mind, of course that Jefferson's travel schedule means he won't be able to sleep in this bed for weeks on end during the NBA season. Unless, that is, he hires a caravan of elephants to carry the bed from city to city. Don't laugh at the suggestion, as ridiculous as it seems. They say you can't put a price on comfort, and Jefferson has clearly taken that lesson to heart.\n\nMore NBA news from Yahoo! Sports:"
