        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats agreed on Thursday to a three-year, $40.5 million contract with free agent center Al Jefferson from the Utah Jazz, said people familiar with the situation.\n\nJefferson will make $13.5 million in each year of the deal, with the third season being a player option.\n\nJefferson, 28, gives the Bobcats a much-needed scoring threat in the low post, where they struggled last season. He should also help on the boards, where the Bobcats were repeatedly outrebounded the last two seasons.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 289-pound Jefferson has averaged 18.8 points and 10 rebounds per game over the past seven seasons. Last season, his third with the Jazz, he averaged 17.8 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists.\n\nTHREE-WAY DEAL: The New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings and Portland Trail Blazers have agreed to terms on a three-team deal that will cementTyreke Evans' move to the Pelicans, according to ESPN.com.\n\nThe trade - which can't be officially completed until July 10 - will send Evans to the Pelicans via sign-and-trade, with Sacramento receiving guard Greivis Vasquez from the Pelicans and Portland acquiring New Orleans center Robin Lopez.\n\nPortland, to complete the trade, will send two future second-round picks to Sacramento and also will acquire guard Terrel Harris from New Orleans along with Lopez. The Blazers also will be required to pay the $1,568,999 trade kicker triggered in Lopez's contract because he's being dealt.\n\nKNICKS: J.R. Smith and Pablo Prigioni are staying in New York to help the Knicks build on their successful 2012-13 season.\n\nThe Sixth Man of the Year and the point guard from Argentina both agreed to multiyear deals Thursday, their agents confirmed.\n\nSmith helped shoot the Knicks into and then out of the playoffs, having the best season of his career but then struggling through the postseason. The product of nearby New Jersey wanted to stay and the Knicks needed to keep him. They worked out a deal that will pay him about $25 million over four years.\n\nSmith averaged 18.1 points during the regular season, second on the team behind Carmelo Anthony. But he momentarily lost his head and then his shot during the postseason, getting suspended a game for elbowing Jason Terry late in Game 3 of a first-round series against Boston and making only 29 percent of his shots in the final eight playoff games.\n\nCAVALIERS: Agreed to terms on a two-year contract with forward Earl Clark, who played alongside Dwight Howard last season in Los Angeles.\n\nClark, who spent two days visiting with the Cavs earlier this week, is getting a deal worth $9 million.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Clark set career-highs in scoring (7.3), rebounds (5.5) and minutes (23.1) in 36 starts last season."
