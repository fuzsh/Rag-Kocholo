        "text": "Threes were a charm for the Utah Jazz on Monday.\n\nNorth of the border, the Jazz took on the Raptors for what was billed as 48 minutes of basketball. The teams went over that allotment by 15 minutes, though, as they took part in not one, not two, but three overtimes at the Air Canada Center.\n\nThe game featured clutch 3-pointers by Paul Millsap and former Celtic Al Jefferson — yes, the 6-foot-10 center — to extend the game into the wee hours. The extra time resulted in a crazy boxscore, starting with the 140-133 final score. Jefferson ended up with 24 points and 17 rebounds while Raptors swingman DeMar DeRozan scored 37 points and Jose Calderon dished out 17 assists.\n\nCheck out highlights of the game in the video below."
