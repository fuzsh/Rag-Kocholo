        "text": "Al Jefferson could be headed to the Spurs. (Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)\n\nThe Feb. 21 trade deadline is officially two weeks away and one player being floated around in NBA circles as being possibly on the move is Al Jefferson of the Utah Jazz.\n\nA number of teams could use the power forward to make a push in the playoffs, but the San Antonio Spurs are reportedly the leading candidate to land Jefferson should a trade happen before the deadline, according to former ESPN columnist and longtime NBA blogger Chris Sheridan of SheridanHoops.com.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are the front-runners to land Al Jefferson in a trade with the Utah Jazz – and they are frontrunners like Secretariat was in the 1973 Belmont Stakes.\n\n“Those teams are practically incestuous, they are on such good terms internally,” one NBA source told me Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the report, the Spurs' Tiago Splitter and Patty Mills are two players that could be sent to the Jazz in exchange for Jefferson, who is in the final year of his contract with Utah."
