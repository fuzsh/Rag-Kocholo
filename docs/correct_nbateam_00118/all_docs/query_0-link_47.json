        "text": "Miles said the team was put off by Al Jefferson’s pre-Game 4 comments about no one beating the Spurs in the playoffs and San Antonio being better than Utah. Miles loves the Jazz, the team’s fans and thinks Corbin will evolve. But he never knew what was expected of him this year. Miles said communication was much better with former coach Jerry Sloan, and Corbin has struggled relaying his message to team.\n\nIt wasn’t tough talk from Harris, who had complimented Parker in the same breath. Jazz center Al Jefferson said the goal was ”not to hurt him or nothing like that,” but rather to dissuade Parker from barreling into the paint and punishing Utah with either an acrobatic layup or kicking out to a 3-point shooter. ”The playoffs is physical. We just can’t let him feel like he can come down in that paint any time he ready,” Jefferson said. Parker brushed off the warning Tuesday. He’s heard worse. ”It’s not the first time someone has said that,” Parker said. ”My answer is always going to be the same: I’m going to keep coming.”"
