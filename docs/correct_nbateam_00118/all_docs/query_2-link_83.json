        "text": "Myles Turner is impressing veteran center Al Jefferson as the Indiana Pacers head towards the start of the season.\n\nIt’s been a hands-on learning experience for Al Jefferson as the backup center for the Indiana Pacers got to know Myles Turner this summer.\n\nDealing with defending Turner on a regular basis has taught Jefferson at least one thing about the second-year player.\n\nJefferson said it “sucks” to guard Turner in scrimmages on the Grady and Big Joe Show last month.\n\nHe also told the show he was impressed with how Turner stretched the court.\n\n“Myles Turner is something special. Things that he can do as far as playing the five and he can play the four because he can shoot the three, can dribble the ball. He’s like a 7-foot guard, in my opinion,” Jefferson said.\n\nAs Jefferson got a better idea about the type of player Turner is, it motivated him to teach Turner a thing or two as well. Jefferson told Basketball Insiders’ Joe Brigham that he plans on being a mentor to Turner and will teach him how to be more effective in the post.\n\nTurner was anything but a post-up player last season, taking only 21.9% of his possessions there compared to Jefferson’s 51.8%. Whereas Turner was more likely to turn the ball over in that situation, Jefferson drew fouls and scored 45.4% of the time when he was in the post.\n\nMore from 8 Points, 9 Seconds\n\nJefferson also says he wants to help with the less tangential things, like managing expectations.\n\nBut it isn’t just Jefferson who is impressed with Turner. Jeff Teague sees some of his former teammate Al Horford in Turner. Jefferson might be teaching Turner to be more like him, but Teague wouldn’t mind if Turner developed more into the other Al.\n\nNo matter which Al, or any other player, Turner develops into, it is a good sign that the team’s veterans already respect what the young man can do.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
