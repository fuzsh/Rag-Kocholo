When it does happen, the last thing I want to do is have parents worrying about how they are going to get their son or daughter to that camp. I just felt like it was the right and only thing to do,\" said Jefferson.\n\nThis is the fourth camp Jefferson has operated in Prentiss.\n\nHe is set to team up with Jackson native Mo Williams this season for the Utah Jazz."
