Old friend Al Jefferson is going to be a free agent next summer. As luck would have it, so is Paul Millsap, which puts the team in a bit of a pickle.

An Open Question: Resign Al Jefferson or Not? - SLC Dunk

I’ve made no secret that I believe the Jazz would be best served by trading Paul Millsap. But there has always been a niggling in my gut when I’ve argued for it, thanks to an almost certain consequence of such a trade: the Jazz would try their best to resign Al Jefferson. And I’m not sure I’ve wanted that. In fact, I’m sure I haven’t wanted that. But after some thought, I’m no longer certain. I know Al isn’t popular in this neighborhood, and, truthfully, I think Paul is a more complete player. The idea of Paul Millsap as a Jazz sixth man for the next five years has me salivating. But the more I consider the question of which player the team should resign, assuming it will be one or the other (a safe assumption, I think most would agree), the more reasons I see for choosing Jefferson. This has me feeling a little icky inside, especially when I think back to any of the times last season when I watched the Jazz get pick and rolled into oblivion. But the reasons aren’t going away.

As a former Al Jefferson apologist, it is hard for me to understand why they don't love Big Al out West, but I suppose it might have something to do with his lack of defense and propensity to get injured. Still, at the right price he would seem to be an asset for any team. Ah yes, price always plays into it too.
