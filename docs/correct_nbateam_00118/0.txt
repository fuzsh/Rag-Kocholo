PRENTISS, MS (Mississippi News Now) - Former Prentiss High School basketball star Al Jefferson returned to his hometown this week for a three day youth basketball camp.

The Utah Jazz star says aside from basketball, giving back is what he likes best.

More than 120 kids showed up for day one of the free camp.

"Stuff like this doesn't happen all the time here. When it does happen, the last thing I want to do is have parents worrying about how they are going to get their son or daughter to that camp. I just felt like it was the right and only thing to do," said Jefferson.

This is the fourth camp Jefferson has operated in Prentiss.

He is set to team up with Jackson native Mo Williams this season for the Utah Jazz.
