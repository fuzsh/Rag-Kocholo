Here, we present a ~96,000-year Hg record from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. A coupled response is observed between Hg flux and shifts in sediment composition reflective of changes in lake level, and suggesting that hydroclimate may be a key driver of tropical Hg cycling over millennial-timescales.\n\nPolar amplification of orbital-scale climate variability in the early Eocene greenhouse world\n\nChris D. Fokkema, Tobias Agterhuis, Danielle Gerritsma, Myrthe de Goeij, Xiaoqing Liu, Pauline de Regt, Addison Rice, Laurens Vennema, Claudia Agnini, Peter K. Bijl, Joost Frieling, Matthew Huber, Francien Peterse, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim.

The factors that dominantly control PA are difficult to separate. Here we provide an estimate for the non-ice-related PA by reconstructing tropical ocean temperature variability from the ice-free early Eocene, which we compare to deep-ocean-derived high-latitude temperature variability across short-lived warming periods. We find a PA factor of 1.7–2.3 on 20 kyr timescales, which is somewhat larger than model estimates.\n\nMercury records covering the past 90 000Â years from lakes Prespa and Ohrid, SEÂ Europe\n\nAlice R. Paine, Isabel M. Fendley, Joost Frieling, Tamsin A. Mather, Jack H. Lacey, Bernd Wagner, Stuart A. Robinson, David M. Pyle, Alexander Francke, Theodore R.

Here, we explore the timing, magnitude, and expression of Hg signals retained in sediments of lakes Prespa and Ohrid over the past ∼90 000 years. Divergent signals suggest that local differences in sediment composition, lake structure, and water balance influence the local Hg cycle and determine the extent to which sedimentary Hg signals reflect local- or global-scale environmental changes.\n\nPaleoceneâEocene age glendonites from the Mid-Norwegian Margin â indicators of cold snaps in the hothouse?\n\nMadeleine L. Vickers, Morgan T. Jones, Jack Longman, David Evans, Clemens V. Ullmann, Ella Wulfsberg Stokke, Martin Vickers, Joost Frieling, Dustin T. Harper, Vincent J. Clementi, and IODP Expedition 396 Scientists\n\nClim.

This study examines their occurrence, association with volcanic sediments, and speculates on the timing and extent of cooling, fitting this with current understanding of global climate during this period. We propose that volcanic activity was key to both physical and chemical conditions that enabled the formation of glendonites in these sediments.\n\nSingle-species dinoflagellate cyst carbon isotope fractionation in core-top sediments: environmental controls, CO2 dependency and proxy potential\n\nJoost Frieling, Linda van Roij, Iris Kleij, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Appy Sluijs\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4651–4668, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4651-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4651-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a first species-specific evaluation of marine core-top dinoflagellate cyst carbon isotope fractionation (εp) to assess natural pCO2 dependency on εp and explore its geological deep-time paleo-pCO2 proxy potential. We find that εp differs between genera and species and that in Operculodinium centrocarpum, εp is controlled by pCO2 and nutrients. Our results highlight the added value of δ13C analyses of individual micrometer-scale sedimentary organic carbon particles.\n\nInitial results of coring at Prees, Cheshire Basin, UK (ICDP JET project): towards an integrated stratigraphy, timescale, and Earth system understanding for the Early Jurassic\n\nStephen P.

Further work will determine periodic changes in depositional environments caused by solar system dynamics and used to reconstruct orbital history.\n\nTracing North Atlantic volcanism and seaway connectivity across the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)\n\nMorgan T.

The gases released from volcanic eruptions and from sediments heated by the magma are believed to have caused severe climate changes in the geological past. We use a variety of volcanic and climatic tracers to assess how the North Atlantic Igneous Province (56–54 Ma) affected the oceans and atmosphere during a period of extreme global warming.\n\nMaastrichtianâRupelian paleoclimates in the southwest Pacific â a critical re-evaluation of biomarker paleothermometry and dinoflagellate cyst paleoecology at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1172\n\nPeter K.

Past, 17, 2393–2425, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we use the latest insights for GDGT and dinocyst-based paleotemperature and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in late Cretaceous–early Oligocene sediments from ODP Site 1172 (East Tasman Plateau, Australia). We reconstruct strong river runoff during the Paleocene–early Eocene, a progressive decline thereafter with increased wet/dry seasonality in the northward-drifting hinterland. Our critical review leaves the anomalous warmth of the Eocene SW Pacific Ocean unexplained.\n\nLate Paleoceneâearly Eocene Arctic Ocean sea surface temperatures: reassessing biomarker paleothermometry at Lomonosov Ridge\n\nAppy Sluijs, Joost Frieling, Gordon N. Inglis, Klaas G. J. Nierop, Francien Peterse, Francesca Sangiorgi, and Stefan Schouten\n\nClim. Past, 16, 2381–2400, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2381-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2381-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe revisit 15-year-old reconstructions of sea surface temperatures in the Arctic Ocean for the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs (∼ 57–53 million years ago) based on the distribution of fossil membrane lipids of archaea preserved in Arctic Ocean sediments. We find that improvements in the methods over the past 15 years do not lead to different results. However, data quality is now higher and potential biases better characterized. Results confirm remarkable Arctic warmth during this time.\n\nChanges in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere through the EoceneâOligocene transition: a modelâdata comparison\n\nAlan T. Kennedy-Asser, Daniel J. Lunt, Paul J. Valdes, Jean-Baptiste Ladant, Joost Frieling, and Vittoria Lauretano\n\nClim. Past, 16, 555–573, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-555-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-555-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal cooling and a major expansion of ice over Antarctica occurred ~ 34 million years ago at the Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT). A large secondary proxy dataset for high-latitude Southern Hemisphere temperature before, after and across the EOT is compiled and compared to simulations from two coupled climate models. Although there are inconsistencies between the models and data, the comparison shows amongst other things that changes in the Drake Passage were unlikely the cause of the EOT.\n\nNortheast Atlantic breakup volcanism and consequences for Paleogene climate change â MagellanPlus Workshop report\n\nChristian Berndt, Sverre Planke, Damon Teagle, Ritske Huismans, Trond Torsvik, Joost Frieling, Morgan T. Jones, Dougal A. Jerram, Christian Tegner, Jan Inge Faleide, Helen Coxall, and Wei-Li Hong\n\nSci.

Twenty-five years after the last ODP leg on these volcanic margins, the reasons for excess melting are still disputed with at least three competing hypotheses being discussed. We are proposing a new drilling campaign that will constrain the timing, rates of volcanism, and vertical movements of rifted margins.\n\nThe DeepMIP contribution to PMIP4: methodologies for selection, compilation and analysis of latest Paleocene and early Eocene climate proxy data, incorporating version 0.1 of the DeepMIP database\n\nChristopher J.

Previously, we outlined the experimental design for climate model simulations. Here, we outline the methods used for compilation and analysis of climate proxy data. The resulting climate atlas will provide insights into the mechanisms that control past warm climate states.\n\nMercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum\n\nMorgan T. Jones, Lawrence M. E. Percival, Ella W. Stokke, Joost Frieling, Tamsin A. Mather, Lars Riber, Brian A. Schubert, Bo Schultz, Christian Tegner, Sverre Planke, and Henrik H. Svensen\n\nClim.

We focus on five sites that cover the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, an extreme global warming event that occurred 55.8 million years ago. We find that sites close to the eruptions from the North Atlantic Igneous Province display significant mercury anomalies across this time interval, suggesting that magmatism played a role in the global warming event.\n\nIdentification of the PaleoceneâEocene boundary in coastal strata in the Otway Basin, Victoria, Australia\n\nJoost Frieling, Emiel P. Huurdeman, Charlotte C. M. Rem, Timme H. Donders, JÃ¶rg Pross, Steven M. Bohaty, Guy R. Holdgate, Stephen J. Gallagher, Brian McGowran, and Peter K. Bijl\n\nJ. Micropalaeontol., 37, 317–339, https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-37-317-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-37-317-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe hothouse climate of the early Paleogene and the associated violent carbon cycle perturbations are of particular interest to understanding current and future global climate change. Using dinoflagellate cysts and stable carbon isotope analyses, we identify several significant events, e.g., the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum in sedimentary deposits from the Otway Basin, SE Australia. We anticipate that this study will facilitate detailed climate reconstructions west of the Tasmanian Gateway.\n\nTransient micropaleontological turnover across a late Eocene (Priabonian) carbon and oxygen isotope shift on Blake Nose (NW Atlantic)\n\nJulia de Entrambasaguas, Thomas Westerhold, Heather L. Jones, and Laia Alegret\n\nJ. Micropalaeontol., 43, 303–322, https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-43-303-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-43-303-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Gulf Stream plays a crucial role in the ocean stability and climate regulation of the Northern Hemisphere. By analysing the fossil microorganisms that lived in the water column and the ocean floor, as well as reconstructing the ancient ocean's biogeochemistry, we were able to trace longitudinal shifts in the Gulf Stream during the late Eocene (36 Ma). Our results provide insight into the Gulf Stream's behaviour and the NW Atlantic's palaeoceanography during the Late Eocene (ca. 36 Ma).\n\nClimate variability, heat distribution, and polar amplification in the warm unipolar âicehouseâ of the Oligocene\n\nDominique K.

We extend an existing marine climate proxy data compilation and present a new compilation and analysis of terrestrial plant assemblages to assess long-term climate trends and variability. Our data–climate model comparison reinforces the notion that models underestimate polar amplification of Oligocene climates, and we identify potential future research directions.\n\nNew evidence for millennial-scale interactions between Hg cycling and hydroclimate from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana\n\nAlice Paine, Joost Frieling, Timothy Shanahan, Tamsin Mather, Nicholas McKay, Stuart Robinson, David Pyle, Isabel Fendley, Ruth Kiely, and William Gosling\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2123,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2123, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Climate of the Past (CP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFew tropical Hg records extend beyond ~12 ka, meaning our current understanding of Hg behaviour may not fully account for the impact of long-term hydroclimate changes on the Hg cycle in these environments. Here, we present a ~96,000-year Hg record from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. A coupled response is observed between Hg flux and shifts in sediment composition reflective of changes in lake level, and suggesting that hydroclimate may be a key driver of tropical Hg cycling over millennial-timescales.\n\nGlacial-interglacial contrasts in the marine inorganic carbon chemistry of the Benguela Upwelling System\n\nSzabina Karancz, Lennart J. de Nooijer, Bas van der Wagt, Marcel T. J. van der Meer, Sambuddha Misra, Rick Hennekam, Zeynep Erdem, Julie Lattaud, Negar Haghipour, Stefan Schouten, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1915,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1915, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Climate of the Past (CP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in upwelling intensity of the Benguela upwelling region during the last glacial motivated us to investigate the local CO2-history during the last glacial to interglacial transition. Using various geochemical tracers on archives from both intermediate and surface waters reveal enhanced storage of carbon at depth during the last glacial maximum. An efficient biological pump likely prevented outgassing of CO2 from intermediate depth to the atmosphere.\n\nControls on the composition of hydroxylated isoGDGTs in cultivated ammonia oxidizing Thaumarchaeota\n\nDevika Varma, Laura Villanueva, Nicole Bale, Pierre Offre, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Stefan Schouten\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1773,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1773, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArchaeal hydroxylated tetraether lipids are increasingly used as temperature indicators in marine settings, but the factors influencing their distribution are still unclear. Analyzing membrane lipids of two Thaumarchaeotal strains showed that the growth phase of the cultures does not affect the lipid distribution, but growth temperature profoundly affects the degree of cyclization of these lipids. Also, the abundance of these lipids is species-specific and is not influenced by temperature.\n\nPolar amplification of orbital-scale climate variability in the early Eocene greenhouse world\n\nChris D. Fokkema, Tobias Agterhuis, Danielle Gerritsma, Myrthe de Goeij, Xiaoqing Liu, Pauline de Regt, Addison Rice, Laurens Vennema, Claudia Agnini, Peter K. Bijl, Joost Frieling, Matthew Huber, Francien Peterse, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim. Past, 20, 1303–1325, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1303-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1303-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPolar amplification (PA) is a key uncertainty in climate projections. The factors that dominantly control PA are difficult to separate. Here we provide an estimate for the non-ice-related PA by reconstructing tropical ocean temperature variability from the ice-free early Eocene, which we compare to deep-ocean-derived high-latitude temperature variability across short-lived warming periods. We find a PA factor of 1.7–2.3 on 20 kyr timescales, which is somewhat larger than model estimates.\n\nTemperature-enhanced effects of iron on Southern Ocean phytoplankton\n\nCharlotte Eich, Mathijs van Manen, J. Scott P. McCain, Loay J. Jabre, Willem H. van de Poll, Jinyoung Jung, Sven B. E. H. Pont, Hung-An Tian, Indah Ardiningsih, Gert-Jan Reichart, Erin M. Bertrand, Corina P. D. Brussaard, and Rob Middag\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1508,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1508, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhytoplankton growth in the Southern Ocean (SO) is often limited by low iron (Fe) concentrations. Sea surface warming impacts Fe availability and can affect phytoplankton growth. We used Fe clean shipboard incubations to test how changes in Fe and temperature affect SO phytoplankton. Their abundances usually increased with Fe addition and temperature increase, with Fe being the major factor. These findings imply potential shifts in ecosystem structure, impacting food webs and elemental cycling.\n\nPaleogene Earth perturbations in the US Atlantic Coastal Plain (PEP-US): coring transects of hyperthermals to understand past carbon injections and ecosystem responses\n\nMarci M.

McLaughlin, Paul N. Pearson, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Morgan F. Schaller, Jean M. Self-Trail, Appy Sluijs, Thomas Westerhold, James D. Wright, and James C. Zachos\n\nSci. Dril., 33, 47–65, https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-33-47-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-33-47-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is the closest geological analog to modern anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but its causes and the responses remain enigmatic. Coastal plain sediments can resolve this uncertainty, but their discontinuous nature requires numerous sites to constrain events. Workshop participants identified 10 drill sites that target the PETM and other interesting intervals. Our post-drilling research will provide valuable insights into Earth system responses.\n\nMercury records covering the past 90 000Â years from lakes Prespa and Ohrid, SEÂ Europe\n\nAlice R. Paine, Isabel M. Fendley, Joost Frieling, Tamsin A. Mather, Jack H. Lacey, Bernd Wagner, Stuart A. Robinson, David M. Pyle, Alexander Francke, Theodore R. Them II, and Konstantinos Panagiotopoulos\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 531–556, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-531-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-531-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany important processes within the global mercury (Hg) cycle operate over thousands of years. Here, we explore the timing, magnitude, and expression of Hg signals retained in sediments of lakes Prespa and Ohrid over the past ∼90 000 years. Divergent signals suggest that local differences in sediment composition, lake structure, and water balance influence the local Hg cycle and determine the extent to which sedimentary Hg signals reflect local- or global-scale environmental changes.\n\nResilient Antarctic monsoonal climate prevented ice growth during the Eocene\n\nMichiel Baatsen, Peter Bijl, Anna von der Heydt, Appy Sluijs, and Henk Dijkstra\n\nClim. Past, 20, 77–90, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-77-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-77-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work introduces the possibility and consequences of monsoons on Antarctica in the warm Eocene climate. We suggest that such a monsoonal climate can be important to understand conditions in Antarctica prior to large-scale glaciation. We can explain seemingly contradictory indications of ice and vegetation on the continent through regional variability. In addition, we provide a new mechanism through which most of Antarctica remained ice-free through a wide range of global climatic changes.\n\nPaleoceneâEocene age glendonites from the Mid-Norwegian Margin â indicators of cold snaps in the hothouse?\n\nMadeleine L. Vickers, Morgan T. Jones, Jack Longman, David Evans, Clemens V. Ullmann, Ella Wulfsberg Stokke, Martin Vickers, Joost Frieling, Dustin T. Harper, Vincent J. Clementi, and IODP Expedition 396 Scientists\n\nClim.

This study examines their occurrence, association with volcanic sediments, and speculates on the timing and extent of cooling, fitting this with current understanding of global climate during this period. We propose that volcanic activity was key to both physical and chemical conditions that enabled the formation of glendonites in these sediments.\n\nSingle-species dinoflagellate cyst carbon isotope fractionation in core-top sediments: environmental controls, CO2 dependency and proxy potential\n\nJoost Frieling, Linda van Roij, Iris Kleij, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Appy Sluijs\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4651–4668, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4651-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4651-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a first species-specific evaluation of marine core-top dinoflagellate cyst carbon isotope fractionation (εp) to assess natural pCO2 dependency on εp and explore its geological deep-time paleo-pCO2 proxy potential. We find that εp differs between genera and species and that in Operculodinium centrocarpum, εp is controlled by pCO2 and nutrients. Our results highlight the added value of δ13C analyses of individual micrometer-scale sedimentary organic carbon particles.\n\nInitial results of coring at Prees, Cheshire Basin, UK (ICDP JET project): towards an integrated stratigraphy, timescale, and Earth system understanding for the Early Jurassic\n\nStephen P.

Dril., 32, 1–25, https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-32-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-32-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present initial results from a 650 m long core of Late Triasssic to Early Jurassic (190–202 Myr) sedimentary strata from the Cheshire Basin, UK, which is shown to be an exceptional record of Earth evolution for the time of break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea. Further work will determine periodic changes in depositional environments caused by solar system dynamics and used to reconstruct orbital history.\n\nElement â Ca ratios in Nodosariida (Foraminifera) and their potential application for paleoenvironmental reconstructions\n\nLaura Pacho, Lennart de Nooijer, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4043–4056, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4043-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4043-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed Mg / Ca and other El / Ca (Na / Ca, B / Ca, Sr / Ca and Ba / Ca) in Nodosariata. Their calcite chemistry is markedly different to that of the other calcifying orders of foraminifera. We show a relation between the species average Mg / Ca and its sensitivity to changes in temperature. Differences were reflected in both the Mg incorporation and the sensitivities of Mg / Ca to temperature.\n\nAssessing environmental change associated with early Eocene hyperthermals in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, USA\n\nWilliam Rush, Jean Self-Trail, Yang Zhang, Appy Sluijs, Henk Brinkhuis, James Zachos, James G. Ogg, and Marci Robinson\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1677–1698, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1677-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1677-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Eocene contains several brief warming periods referred to as hyperthermals. Studying these events and how they varied between locations can help provide insight into our future warmer world. This study provides a characterization of two of these events in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA. The records of climate that we measured demonstrate significant changes during this time period, but the type and timing of these changes highlight the complexity of climatic changes.\n\nTracing North Atlantic volcanism and seaway connectivity across the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)\n\nMorgan T. Jones, Ella W. Stokke, Alan D. Rooney, Joost Frieling, Philip A. E. Pogge von Strandmann, David J. Wilson, Henrik H. Svensen, Sverre Planke, Thierry Adatte, Nicolas Thibault, Madeleine L. Vickers, Tamsin A. Mather, Christian Tegner, Valentin Zuchuat, and Bo P. Schultz\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1623–1652, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1623-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1623-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are periods in Earthâs history when huge volumes of magma are erupted at the Earthâs surface. The gases released from volcanic eruptions and from sediments heated by the magma are believed to have caused severe climate changes in the geological past. We use a variety of volcanic and climatic tracers to assess how the North Atlantic Igneous Province (56–54 Ma) affected the oceans and atmosphere during a period of extreme global warming.\n\nUltradian rhythms in shell composition of photosymbiotic and non-photosymbiotic mollusks\n\nNiels J. de Winter, Daniel Killam, Lukas FrÃ¶hlich, Lennart de Nooijer, Wim Boer, Bernd R. SchÃ¶ne, Julien ThÃ©bault, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3027–3052, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3027-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3027-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMollusk shells are valuable recorders of climate and environmental changes of the past down to a daily resolution. To explore this potential, we measured changes in the composition of shells of two types of bivalves recorded at the hourly scale: the king scallop Pecten maximus and giant clams (Tridacna) that engaged in photosymbiosis. We find that photosymbiosis produces more day–night fluctuation in shell chemistry but that most of the variation is not periodic, perhaps recording weather.\n\nThe dispersal of fluvially discharged and marine, shelf-produced particulate organic matter in the northern Gulf of Mexico\n\nYord W. Yedema, Francesca Sangiorgi, Appy Sluijs, Jaap S. Sinninghe DamstÃ©, and Francien Peterse\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 663–686, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-663-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-663-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTerrestrial organic matter (TerrOM) is transported to the ocean by rivers, where its burial can potentially form a long-term carbon sink. This burial is dependent on the type and characteristics of the TerrOM. We used bulk sediment properties, biomarkers, and palynology to identify the dispersal patterns of plant-derived, soil–microbial, and marine OM in the northern Gulf of Mexico and show that plant-derived OM is transported further into the coastal zone than soil and marine-produced TerrOM.\n\nNature and origin of variations in pelagic carbonate production in the tropical ocean since the mid-Miocene (ODP Site 927)\n\nPauline Cornuault, Thomas Westerhold, Heiko PÃ¤like, Torsten Bickert, Karl-Heinz Baumann, and Michal Kucera\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 597–618, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe generated high-resolution records of carbonate accumulation rate from the Miocene to the Quaternary in the tropical Atlantic Ocean to characterize the variability in pelagic carbonate production during warm climates. It follows orbital cycles, responding to local changes in tropical conditions, as well as to long-term shifts in climate and ocean chemistry. These changes were sufficiently large to play a role in the carbon cycle and global climate evolution.\n\nPrecessional pacing of tropical ocean carbon export during the Late Cretaceous\n\nJi-Eun Kim, Thomas Westerhold, Laia Alegret, Anna Joy Drury, Ursula RÃ¶hl, and Elizabeth M. Griffith\n\nClim.

Our records from marine sediments show the Pacific tropical marine biological carbon pump was driven by variations in seasonal insolation in the tropics during the Late Cretaceous and may play a key role in modulating climate and the carbon cycle globally in the future.\n\nAccurately calibrated X-ray fluorescence core scanning (XRF-CS) record of Ti â Al reveals Early Pleistocene aridity and humidity variability over North Africa and its close relationship to low-latitude insolation\n\nRick Hennekam, Katharine M.

We demonstrate here how to obtain reliable Ti/Al data using an efficient scanning method that allows rapid acquisition of long climate records at low expense. Using this method, we reconstruct a 3-million-year North African climate record. African environmental variability was paced predominantly by low-latitude insolation from 3–1.2 million years ago.\n\nA 15-million-year surface- and subsurface-integrated TEX86 temperature record from the eastern equatorial Atlantic\n\nCarolien M. H. van der Weijst, Koen J. van der Laan, Francien Peterse, Gert-Jan Reichart, Francesca Sangiorgi, Stefan Schouten, Tjerk J. T. Veenstra, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim. Past, 18, 1947–1962, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1947-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1947-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe TEX86 proxy is often used by paleoceanographers to reconstruct past sea-surface temperatures. However, the origin of the TEX86 signal in marine sediments has been debated since the proxy was first proposed. In our paper, we show that TEX86 carries a mixed sea-surface and subsurface temperature signal and should be calibrated accordingly. Using our 15-million-year record, we subsequently show how a TEX86 subsurface temperature record can be used to inform us on past sea-surface temperatures.\n\nPhysiological control on carbon isotope fractionation in marine phytoplankton\n\nKaren M. Brandenburg, BjÃ¶rn Rost, Dedmer B. Van de Waal, Mirja Hoins, and Appy Sluijs\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 3305–3315, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3305-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3305-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReconstructions of past CO2 concentrations rely on proxy estimates, with one line of proxies relying on the CO2-dependence of stable carbon isotope fractionation in marine phytoplankton. Culturing experiments provide insights into which processes may impact this. We found, however, that the methods with which these culturing experiments are performed also influence 13C fractionation. Caution should therefore be taken when extrapolating results from these experiments to proxy applications.\n\nPliocene evolution of the tropical Atlantic thermocline depth\n\nCarolien M. H. van der Weijst, Josse Winkelhorst, Wesley de Nooijer, Anna von der Heydt, Gert-Jan Reichart, Francesca Sangiorgi, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim. Past, 18, 961–973, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-961-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-961-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA hypothesized link between Pliocene (5.3–2.5 million years ago) global climate and tropical thermocline depth is currently only backed up by data from the Pacific Ocean. In our paper, we present temperature, salinity, and thermocline records from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Surprisingly, the Pliocene thermocline evolution was remarkably different in the Atlantic and Pacific. We need to reevaluate the mechanisms that drive thermocline depth, and how these are tied to global climate change.\n\nRADIv1: a non-steady-state early diagenetic model for ocean sediments in Julia and MATLAB/GNU Octave\n\nOlivier Sulpis, Matthew P. Humphreys, Monica M. Wilhelmus, Dustin Carroll, William M. Berelson, Dimitris Menemenlis, Jack J. Middelburg, and Jess F. Adkins\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2105–2131, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2105-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2105-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA quarter of the surface of the Earth is covered by marine sediments rich in calcium carbonates, and their dissolution acts as a giant antacid tablet protecting the ocean against human-made acidification caused by massive CO2 emissions. Here, we present a new model of sediment chemistry that incorporates the latest experimental findings on calcium carbonate dissolution kinetics. This model can be used to predict how marine sediments evolve through time in response to environmental perturbations.\n\nQuantifying functional consequences of habitat degradation on a Caribbean coral reef\n\nAlice E. Webb, Didier M. de Bakker, Karline Soetaert, Tamara da Costa, Steven M. A. C. van Heuven, Fleur C. van Duyl, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Lennart J. de Nooijer\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 6501–6516, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6501-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6501-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe biogeochemical behaviour of shallow reef communities is quantified to better understand the impact of habitat degradation and species composition shifts on reef functioning. The reef communities investigated barely support reef functions that are usually ascribed to conventional coral reefs, and the overall biogeochemical behaviour is found to be similar regardless of substrate type. This suggests a decrease in functional diversity which may therefore limit services provided by this reef.\n\nMaastrichtianâRupelian paleoclimates in the southwest Pacific â a critical re-evaluation of biomarker paleothermometry and dinoflagellate cyst paleoecology at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1172\n\nPeter K.

We reconstruct strong river runoff during the Paleocene–early Eocene, a progressive decline thereafter with increased wet/dry seasonality in the northward-drifting hinterland. Our critical review leaves the anomalous warmth of the Eocene SW Pacific Ocean unexplained.\n\nClimate, cryosphere and carbon cycle controls on Southeast Atlantic orbital-scale carbonate deposition since the Oligocene (30â0 Ma)\n\nAnna Joy Drury, Diederik Liebrand, Thomas Westerhold, Helen M.

During ~ 30–13 Ma, eccentricity (orbital circularity) paced carbonate deposition. After the mid-Miocene Climate Transition (~ 14 Ma), precession (Earth's tilt direction) increasingly drove carbonate variability. In the latest Miocene (~ 8 Ma), obliquity (Earth's tilt) pacing appeared, signalling increasing high-latitude influence.\n\nNorth Atlantic marine biogenic silica accumulation through the early to middle Paleogene: implications for ocean circulation and silicate weathering feedback\n\nJakub Witkowski, Karolina BryÅka, Steven M.

Biogenic opal accumulation was controlled by deepwater temperatures, atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, and continental weathering intensity. Overturning circulation in the Atlantic was established at the end of the extreme early Eocene greenhouse warmth period. We also show that the strength of the link between climate and continental weathering varies through time.\n\nFe-binding organic ligands in coastal and frontal regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula\n\nIndah Ardiningsih, Kyyas Seyitmuhammedov, Sylvia G. Sander, Claudine H. Stirling, Gert-Jan Reichart, Kevin R. Arrigo, Loes J. A. Gerringa, and Rob Middag\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4587–4601, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4587-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4587-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic Fe speciation is investigated along a natural gradient of the western Antarctic Peninsula from an ice-covered shelf to the open ocean. The two major fronts in the region affect the distribution of ligands. The excess ligands not bound to dissolved Fe (DFe) comprised up to 80 % of the total ligand concentrations, implying the potential to solubilize additional Fe input. The ligands on the shelf can increase the DFe residence time and fuel local primary production upon ice melt.\n\nIntroducing GloRiSe â a global database on river sediment composition\n\nGerrit MÃ¼ller, Jack J. Middelburg, and Appy Sluijs\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

As the composition of river waters and particles results from processes in their catchment, such as erosion, weathering, environmental pollution, nutrient and carbon cycling, Earth-spanning databases of river composition are needed for studies of these processes on a global scale. While extensive resources on water and nutrient composition exist, we provide a database of river particle composition.\n\nPorewater Î´13CDOC indicates variable extent of degradation in different talik layers of coastal Alaskan thermokarst lakes\n\nOve H.

Vonk, Lukas Wacker, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Han Dolman\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2241–2258, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2241-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2241-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic permafrost lakes form thaw bulbs of unfrozen soil (taliks) beneath them where carbon degradation and greenhouse gas production are increased. We analyzed the stable carbon isotopes of Alaskan talik sediments and their porewater dissolved organic carbon and found that the top layers of these taliks are likely more actively degraded than the deeper layers. This in turn implies that these top layers are likely also more potent greenhouse gas producers than the underlying deeper layers.\n\nMgâCa, SrâCa and stable isotopes from the planktonic foraminifera T. sacculifer: testing a multi-proxy approach for inferring paleotemperature and paleosalinity\n\nDelphine Dissard, Gert Jan Reichart, Christophe Menkes, Morgan Mangeas, Stephan Frickenhaus, and Jelle Bijma\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 423–439, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-423-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-423-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nResults from a data set acquired from living foraminifera T. sacculifer collected from surface waters are presented, allowing us to establish a new Mg/CaâSr/Caâtemperature equation improving temperature reconstructions. When combining equations, δ18Ow can be reconstructed with a precision of ± 0.5 ‰, while successive reconstructions involving Mg/Ca and δ18Oc preclude salinity reconstruction with a precision better than ± 1.69. A new direct linear fit to reconstruct salinity could be established.\n\nCarbonic anhydrase is involved in calcification by the benthic foraminifer Amphistegina lessonii\n\nSiham de Goeyse, Alice E. Webb, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Lennart J. de Nooijer\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 393–401, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForaminifera are calcifying organisms that play a role in the marine inorganic-carbon cycle and are widely used to reconstruct paleoclimates. However, the fundamental process by which they calcify remains essentially unknown. Here we use inhibitors to show that an enzyme is speeding up the conversion between bicarbonate and CO2. This helps the foraminifera acquire sufficient carbon for calcification and might aid their tolerance to elevated CO2 level.\n\nExploring a link between the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum and Neotethys continental arc flare-up\n\nAnnique van der Boon, Klaudia F. Kuiper, Robin van der Ploeg, Marlow J. Cramwinckel, Maryam Honarmand, Appy Sluijs, and Wout Krijgsman\n\nClim. Past, 17, 229–239, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-229-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-229-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\n40.5 million years ago, Earth's climate warmed, but it is unknown why. Enhanced volcanism has been suggested, but this has not yet been tied to a specific region. We explore an increase in volcanism in Iran. We dated igneous rocks and compiled ages from the literature. We estimated the volume of igneous rocks in Iran in order to calculate the amount of CO2 that could have been released due to enhanced volcanism. We conclude that an increase in volcanism in Iran is a plausible cause of warming.\n\nDrivers of nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in a groundwater-fed urban catchment revealed by high-frequency monitoring\n\nLiang Yu, Joachim C. Rozemeijer, Hans Peter Broers, Boris M. van Breukelen, Jack J. Middelburg, Maarten Ouboter, and Ype van der Velde\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 69–87, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-69-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-69-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe assessment of the collected water quality information is for the managers to find a way to improve the water environment to satisfy human uses and environmental needs. We found groundwater containing high concentrations of nutrient mixes with rain water in the ditches. The stable solutes are diluted during rain. The change in nutrients over time is determined by and uptaken by organisms and chemical processes. The water is more enriched with nutrients and looked dirtier during winter.\n\nThe middle to late Eocene greenhouse climate modelled using the CESM 1.0.5\n\nMichiel Baatsen, Anna S. von der Heydt, Matthew Huber, Michael A. Kliphuis, Peter K. Bijl, Appy Sluijs, and Henk A. Dijkstra\n\nClim. Past, 16, 2573–2597, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2573-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2573-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarm climates of the deep past have proven to be challenging to reconstruct with the same numerical models used for future predictions. We present results of CESM simulations for the middle to late Eocene (∼ 38 Ma), in which we managed to match the available indications of temperature well. With these results we can now look into regional features and the response to external changes to ultimately better understand the climate when it is in such a warm state.\n\nEvaluation of oxygen isotopes and trace elements in planktonic foraminifera from the Mediterranean Sea as recorders of seawater oxygen isotopes and salinity\n\nLinda K. DÃ¤mmer, Lennart de Nooijer, Erik van Sebille, Jan G. Haak, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nClim. Past, 16, 2401–2414, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2401-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-2401-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe compositions of foraminifera shells often vary with environmental parameters such as temperature or salinity; thus, they can be used as proxies for these environmental variables. Often a single proxy is influenced by more than one parameter. Here, we show that while salinity impacts shell Na / Ca, temperature has no effect. We also show that the combination of different proxies (Mg / Ca and δ18O) to reconstruct salinity does not seem to work as previously thought.\n\nLate Paleoceneâearly Eocene Arctic Ocean sea surface temperatures: reassessing biomarker paleothermometry at Lomonosov Ridge\n\nAppy Sluijs, Joost Frieling, Gordon N. Inglis, Klaas G. J. Nierop, Francien Peterse, Francesca Sangiorgi, and Stefan Schouten\n\nClim.

We find that improvements in the methods over the past 15 years do not lead to different results. However, data quality is now higher and potential biases better characterized. Results confirm remarkable Arctic warmth during this time.\n\nDistribution of chlorine and fluorine in benthic foraminifera\n\nAnne Roepert, Lubos Polerecky, Esmee Geerken, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Jack J. Middelburg\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 4727–4743, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4727-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4727-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated, for the first time, the spatial distribution of chlorine and fluorine in the shell walls of four benthic foraminifera species: Ammonia tepida, Amphistegina lessonii, Archaias angulatus, and Sorites marginalis. Cross sections of specimens were imaged using nanoSIMS. The distribution of Cl and F was co-located with organics in the rotaliids and rather homogeneously distributed in miliolids. We suggest that the incorporation is governed by the biomineralization pathway.\n\nSurface-circulation change in the southwest Pacific Ocean across the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum: inferences from dinoflagellate cysts and biomarker paleothermometry\n\nMarlow J. Cramwinckel, Lineke Woelders, Emiel P. Huurdeman, Francien Peterse, Stephen J. Gallagher, JÃ¶rg Pross, Catherine E. Burgess, Gert-Jan Reichart, Appy Sluijs, and Peter K. Bijl\n\nClim.

Using fossil plankton and organic molecules, here we reconstruct surface ocean temperature and circulation in and around the Tasman Gateway during a warming phase 40 million years ago termed the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. We find that plankton assemblages track ocean circulation patterns, with superimposed variability being related to temperature.\n\nEarly Pliocene deepening of the tropical Atlantic thermocline\n\nCarolien Maria Hendrina van der Weijst, Josse Winkelhorst, Anna von der Heydt, Gert-Jan Reichart, Francesca Sangiorgi, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim.

Edgar, Steven M. Bohaty, Helen K. Coxall, Paul R. Bown, Sietske J. Batenburg, Caroline H. Lear, and Paul N. Pearson\n\nJ. Micropalaeontol., 39, 117–138, https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-39-117-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/jm-39-117-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe identify the first continuous carbonate-bearing sediment record from the tropical ocean that spans the entirety of the global warming event, the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, ca. 40 Ma. We determine significant mismatches between middle Eocene calcareous microfossil datums from the tropical Pacific Ocean and established low-latitude zonation schemes. We highlight the potential of ODP Site 865 for future investigations into environmental and biotic changes throughout the early Paleogene.\n\nAssessing branched tetraether lipids as tracers of soil organic carbon transport through the Carminowe Creek catchment (southwest England)\n\nJingjing Guo, Miriam Glendell, Jeroen Meersmans, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Kirkels, Jack J. Middelburg, and Francien Peterse\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3183–3201, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3183-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3183-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe fluxes of soil organic carbon (OC) transport from land to sea are poorly constrained, mostly due to the lack of a specific tracer for soil OC. Here we evaluate the use of specific molecules derived from soil bacteria as a tracer for soil OC in a small river catchment. We find that the initial soil signal is lost upon entering the aquatic environment. However, the local environmental history of the catchment is reflected by these molecules in the lake sediments that act as their sink.\n\nPatterns of (trace) metals and microorganisms in the Rainbow hydrothermal vent plume at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n\nSabine Haalboom, David M. Price, Furu Mienis, Judith D. L. van Bleijswijk, Henko C. de Stigter, Harry J. Witte, Gert-Jan Reichart, and Gerard C. A. Duineveld\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2499–2519, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2499-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2499-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral mining in deep-sea hydrothermal settings will lead to the formation of plumes of fine-grained, chemically reactive, suspended matter. Understanding how natural hydrothermal plumes evolve as they disperse from their source, and how they affect their surrounding environment, may help in characterising the behaviour of the diluted part of mining plumes. The natural plume provided a heterogeneous, geochemically enriched habitat conducive to the development of a distinct microbial ecology.\n\nChanges in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere through the EoceneâOligocene transition: a modelâdata comparison\n\nAlan T. Kennedy-Asser, Daniel J. Lunt, Paul J. Valdes, Jean-Baptiste Ladant, Joost Frieling, and Vittoria Lauretano\n\nClim.

A large secondary proxy dataset for high-latitude Southern Hemisphere temperature before, after and across the EOT is compiled and compared to simulations from two coupled climate models. Although there are inconsistencies between the models and data, the comparison shows amongst other things that changes in the Drake Passage were unlikely the cause of the EOT.\n\nJoint inversion of proxy system models to reconstruct paleoenvironmental time series from heterogeneous data\n\nGabriel J. Bowen, Brenden Fischer-Femal, Gert-Jan Reichart, Appy Sluijs, and Caroline H. Lear\n\nClim.

We propose that such reconstructions are best obtained by statistical inversion of hierarchical models that represent how multiâproxy observations and calibration data are produced by variation of environmental conditions in time and/or space. These methods extract new information from traditional proxies and provide robust, comprehensive estimates of uncertainty.\n\nNortheast Atlantic breakup volcanism and consequences for Paleogene climate change â MagellanPlus Workshop report\n\nChristian Berndt, Sverre Planke, Damon Teagle, Ritske Huismans, Trond Torsvik, Joost Frieling, Morgan T.

Twenty-five years after the last ODP leg on these volcanic margins, the reasons for excess melting are still disputed with at least three competing hypotheses being discussed. We are proposing a new drilling campaign that will constrain the timing, rates of volcanism, and vertical movements of rifted margins.\n\nEnvironmental factors influencing benthic communities in the oxygen minimum zones on the Angolan and Namibian margins\n\nUlrike Hanz, Claudia Wienberg, Dierk Hebbeln, Gerard Duineveld, Marc Lavaleye, Katriina Juva, Wolf-Christian Dullo, AndrÃ© Freiwald, Leonardo Tamborrino, Gert-Jan Reichart, Sascha FlÃ¶gel, and Furu Mienis\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4337–4356, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4337-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4337-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlong the Namibian and Angolan margins, low oxygen conditions do not meet environmental ranges for coldâwater corals and hence are expected to be unsuitable habitats. Environmental conditions show that tidal movements deliver water with more oxygen and highâquality organic matter, suggesting that corals compensate unfavorable conditions with availability of food. With the expected expansion of oxygen minimum zones in the future, this study provides an example how ecosystems cope with extremes.\n\nPhytoplankton community disruption caused by latest Cretaceous global warming\n\nJohan Vellekoop, Lineke Woelders, Appy Sluijs, Kenneth G.

This increased ecosystem stress during the latest Maastrichtian potentially primed global ecosystems for the subsequent mass extinction following the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary impact.\n\nCARBON-DISC 1.0 – A coupled, process-based model of global in-stream carbon biogeochemistry\n\nWim Joost van Hoek, Lauriane Vilmin, Arthur H.

We present 8 Myr CaCO3 and bulk sediment records from seven eastern Pacific scientific drill sites to identify intervals of excess CaCO3 dissolution (high carbon storage in the oceans) and excess burial of plankton hard parts indicating high productivity. We define the regional extent of production intervals and explore the impact of the closure of the Atlantic–Pacific Panama connection on CaCO3 burial.\n\nThe DeepMIP contribution to PMIP4: methodologies for selection, compilation and analysis of latest Paleocene and early Eocene climate proxy data, incorporating version 0.1 of the DeepMIP database\n\nChristopher J.

Previously, we outlined the experimental design for climate model simulations. Here, we outline the methods used for compilation and analysis of climate proxy data. The resulting climate atlas will provide insights into the mechanisms that control past warm climate states.\n\nGlobal database and model on dissolved carbon in soil solution\n\nJoep Langeveld, Alexander F.

We use this database to construct the first global models and maps on DOC in soil pore water. Highest concentrations in shallow soils occur in forests of cooler, humid zones. Highest concentrations in deeper soils are calculated for Histosols. Our research enables a spatially explicit first estimation of dissolved carbon in soil solution on the global scale.\n\nCoupled calcium and inorganic carbon uptake suggested by magnesium and sulfur incorporation in foraminiferal calcite\n\nInge van Dijk, Christine Barras, Lennart Jan de Nooijer, AurÃ©lia Mouret, Esmee Geerken, Shai Oron, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2115–2130, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2115-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2115-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSystematics in the incorporation of different elements in shells of marine organisms can be used to test calcification models and thus processes involved in precipitation of calcium carbonates. On different scales, we observe a covariation of sulfur and magnesium incorporation in shells of foraminifera, which provides insights into the mechanics behind shell formation. The observed patterns imply that all species of foraminifera actively take up calcium and carbon in a coupled process.\n\nPlanktonic foraminiferal spine versus shell carbonate Na incorporation in relation to salinity\n\nEveline M. Mezger, Lennart J. de Nooijer, Jacqueline Bertlich, Jelle Bijma, Dirk NÃ¼rnberg, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 1147–1165, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1147-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1147-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeawater salinity is an important factor when trying to reconstruct past ocean conditions. Foraminifera, small organisms living in the sea, produce shells that incorporate more Na at higher salinities. The accuracy of reconstructions depends on the fundamental understanding involved in the incorporation and preservation of the original Na of the shell. In this study, we unravel the Na composition of different components of the shell and describe the relative contribution of these components.\n\nMineral formation induced by cable bacteria performing long-distance electron transport in marine sediments\n\nNicole M.

They affect the chemistry and mineralogy of their surroundings and vice versa. How the surroundings affect the cable bacteria is investigated. They show three different types of biomineral formation: (1) a polymer containing phosphorus in their cells, (2) a sheath of clay surrounding the surface of the filament and (3) the encrustation of a filament via a solid phase containing iron and phosphorus.\n\nMercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum\n\nMorgan T.

We focus on five sites that cover the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, an extreme global warming event that occurred 55.8 million years ago. We find that sites close to the eruptions from the North Atlantic Igneous Province display significant mercury anomalies across this time interval, suggesting that magmatism played a role in the global warming event.\n\nThe 405 kyr and 2.4 Myr eccentricity components in Cenozoic carbon isotope records\n\nIlja J.

Here, we simulate the response of the carbon cycle to astronomical forcing. We find a strong 2.4 million year cycle in the model output, which is present as an amplitude modulator of the 405 and 100 thousand year eccentricity cycles in a newly assembled composite record.\n\nManganese incorporation in living (stained) benthic foraminiferal shells: a bathymetric and in-sediment study in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean)\n\nShauna NÃ­ Fhlaithearta, Christophe Fontanier, Frans Jorissen, AurÃ©lia Mouret, Adriana DueÃ±as-BohÃ³rquez, Pierre Anschutz, Mattias B.

We focus on the incorporation of the trace metal manganese (Mn), with the aim of developing a tool to reconstruct past pore water profiles. Manganese concentrations in foraminifera are investigated relative to their ecological preferences and geochemical environment. This study demonstrates that Mn in foraminiferal tests is a promising tool to reconstruct oxygen conditions in the seabed.\n\nSalinity control on Na incorporation into calcite tests of the planktonic foraminifera Trilobatus sacculifer â evidence from culture experiments and surface sediments\n\nJacqueline Bertlich, Dirk NÃ¼rnberg, Ed C.

Here we document a major increase in sediment accumulation rates on a subtropical continental margin during the PETM, likely due to marked changes in hydro-climates and sediment transport. These high sedimentation rates persist through the event and may play a key role in the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by the burial of organic carbon.\n\nPaleoceanography and ice sheet variability offshore Wilkes Land, Antarctica â Part 1: Insights from late Oligocene astronomically paced contourite sedimentation\n\nAriadna Salabarnada, Carlota Escutia, Ursula RÃ¶hl, C.

The new obliquity-forced glacial–interglacial sedimentary model shows that, under the high CO2 values of the late Oligocene, ice sheets had mostly retreated to their terrestrial margins and the ocean was very dynamic with shifting positions of the polar fronts and associated water masses.\n\nImpact of salinity on element incorporation in two benthic foraminiferal species with contrasting magnesium contents\n\nEsmee Geerken, Lennart Jan de Nooijer, Inge van Dijk, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 2205–2218, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2205-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2205-2018, 2018\n\nEquilibrium state and sensitivity of the simulated middle-to-late Eocene climate\n\nMichiel Baatsen, Anna S. von der Heydt, Matthew Huber, Michael A.

Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2018-43,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2018-43, 2018\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Eocene marks a period where the climate was in a hothouse state, without any continental-scale ice sheets. Such climates have proven difficult to reproduce in models, especially their low temperature difference between equator and poles. Here, we present high resolution CESM simulations using a new geographic reconstruction of the middle-to-late Eocene. The results provide new insights into a period for which knowledge is limited, leading up to a transition into the present icehouse state.\n\nLandâsea coupling of early Pleistocene glacial cycles in the southern North Sea exhibit dominant Northern Hemisphere forcing\n\nTimme H.

Based on molecular compounds and microfossils from sediments dating back to the early glaciations we show that the temperature on land and in the sea changed simultaneously and was a major factor in the ice buildup in the Northern Hemisphere. These data provide key insights into the dynamics of early glaciations.\n\nSynchronizing early Eocene deep-sea and continental records â cyclostratigraphic age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project drill cores\n\nThomas Westerhold, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Roy H.

New high-resolution age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) drill cores help to improve age models for climate records from deep-sea drill cores and for the first time point to a concurrent major change in marine and terrestrial biota 54.25 million years ago.\n\nReinforcing the North Atlantic backbone: revision and extension of the composite splice at ODP SiteÂ 982\n\nAnna Joy Drury, Thomas Westerhold, David Hodell, and Ursula RÃ¶hl\n\nClim.

However, the stratigraphy and age model are unverified. We verify the composite splice using XRF core scanning data and establish a revised benthic foraminiferal stable isotope astrochronology from 8.0–4.5 million years ago. Our new stratigraphy accurately correlates the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and suggests a connection between late Miocene cooling and dynamic ice sheet expansion.\n\nAstronomical tunings of the OligoceneâMiocene transition from Pacific Ocean Site U1334 and implications for the carbon cycle\n\nHelen M.

These records range from 24 to 22 million years ago, a time period when Earth was warmer than today and the only land ice was located on Antarctica. We use tectonic plate-pair spreading rates to test the two timescales, which shows that the carbonate record yields the best timescale. In turn, this implies that Earthâs climate system and carbon cycle responded slowly to changes in incoming solar radiation.\n\nIdentification of the PaleoceneâEocene boundary in coastal strata in the Otway Basin, Victoria, Australia\n\nJoost Frieling, Emiel P.

Using dinoflagellate cysts and stable carbon isotope analyses, we identify several significant events, e.g., the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum in sedimentary deposits from the Otway Basin, SE Australia. We anticipate that this study will facilitate detailed climate reconstructions west of the Tasmanian Gateway.\n\nReviews and syntheses: to the bottom of carbon processing at the seafloor\n\nJack J.

These disciplinary approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. This award talk provides a synthesis, highlights the role of animals in sediment carbon processing and presents some new concepts.\n\nAstronomical calibration of the Ypresian timescale: implications for seafloor spreading rates and the chaotic behavior of the solar system?\n\nThomas Westerhold, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Thomas Frederichs, Claudia Agnini, Isabella Raffi, James C.

We used cyclic variations in the data caused by periodic changes in EarthÃ¤s orbit around the sun as a metronome for timescale construction. Our new data compilation provides the first geological evidence for chaos in the long-term behavior of planetary orbits in the solar system, as postulated almost 30 years ago, and a possible link to plate tectonics events.\n\nBa incorporation in benthic foraminifera\n\nLennart J. de Nooijer, Anieke Brombacher, Antje Mewes, Gerald Langer, Gernot Nehrke, Jelle Bijma, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3387–3400, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3387-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3387-2017, 2017\n\nRevisiting the Ceara Rise, equatorial Atlantic Ocean: isotope stratigraphy of ODP Leg 154 from 0 to 5â¯Ma\n\nRoy H.

As a test case, data from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 154 (Ceara Rise – western equatorial Atlantic) were assembled into a new regional composite benthic stable isotope record covering the last 5 million years.\n\nBenthic foraminiferal Mnâ¯/â¯Ca ratios reflect microhabitat preferences\n\nKaroliina A.

The results show that the Mn incorporation directly reflects the environment where the foraminifera calcify. Foraminifera that live deeper in sediment, under greater redox stress, generally incorporate more Mn into their carbonate skeletons. As such, foraminifera living close to the Mn reduction zone in sediment appear promising tools for paleoceanographic reconstructions of sedimentary redox conditions.\n\nTrends in element incorporation in hyaline and porcelaneous foraminifera as a function of pCO2\n\nInge van Dijk, Lennart J. de Nooijer, and Gert-Jan Reichart\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 497–510, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-497-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-497-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCulturing foraminifera under controlled pCO2 conditions shows that incorporation of certain elements (Zn, Ba) into foraminiferal shells is impacted by the inorganic carbonate system. Modeling the chemical speciation of these elements suggests that incorporation is determined by the availability of free ions. Furthermore, analyzing and comparing trends in element incorporation in hyaline and porcelaneous species may provide constrains on the differences between their calcification strategies.\n\nFood selectivity and processing by the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa\n\nDick van Oevelen, Christina E.

Middelburg\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5789–5798, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5789-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5789-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCold-water corals form true hotspots of biodiversity in the cold and dark deep sea, but need to live off of only small amounts of food that reach the deep sea. Using chemical tracers, this study investigated whether cold-water corals are picky eaters. We found that under low food conditions, they do not differentiate between food sources but they do differentiate at high food concentrations. This adaptation suggests that they are well adapted to exploit short food pulses efficiently.\n\nReconstructing geographical boundary conditions for palaeoclimate modelling during the Cenozoic\n\nMichiel Baatsen, Douwe J.

Here, a new method is presented to automate much of the process of generating the necessary geographical reconstructions. The latter can be made using various rotational frameworks and topography/bathymetry input, allowing for easy inter-comparisons and the incorporation of the latest insights from geoscientific research.\n\nPatterns of carbon processing at the seafloor: the role of faunal and microbial communities in moderating carbon flows\n\nClare Woulds, Steven Bouillon, Gregory L.

We used tracer experiments to investigate how site conditions affect the way in which seafloor biological communities cycle carbon. We showed that while total respiration rates are primarily determined by temperature, total carbon processing by the biological community is strongly related to its biomass. Further, we saw a distinct pattern of carbon cycling in sandy sediment, in which uptake by bacteria dominates.\n\nMaastrichtian carbon isotope stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy of the Newfoundland Margin (Site U1403, IODP Leg 342)\n\nOliver Friedrich, Sietske J.

Therefore, we used an expanded deep ocean record from the North Atlantic that shows distinct sedimentary cyclicity suggesting orbital forcing. A high-resolution carbon-isotope record from bulk carbonates allows to identify global trends in the carbon cycle. Our new carbon isotope record and the established cyclostratigraphy may serve as a future reference site.\n\nEquatorward phytoplankton migration during a cold spell within the Late Cretaceous super-greenhouse\n\nNiels A.

To better understand present and future trends it is important to document and fully understand the biogeographical response of marine life during episodes of environmental change in the geological past. Here we investigate the response of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food web, to a rapid cold spell, interrupting greenhouse conditions during the Cretaceous.\n\nGlobal riverine N and P transport to ocean increased during the 20th century despite increased retention along the aquatic continuum\n\nArthur H.

Concurrently, the cumulative number of reservoirs has driven a rise in freshwater nutrient retention and removal. Still, river nutrient transport to the ocean has also nearly doubled, potentially stressing coastal environments.\n\nCoupling global models for hydrology and nutrient loading to simulate nitrogen and phosphorus retention in surface water – description of IMAGEâGNM and analysis of performance\n\nA.

N and P are delivered to water bodies via diffuse sources (agriculture and natural ecosystems) and wastewater. N and P retention in a water body is calculated on the basis of the residence time of the water and nutrient uptake velocity.\n\nExpansion and diversification of high-latitude radiolarian assemblages in the late Eocene linked to a cooling event in the southwest Pacific\n\nK.

A short incursion of low-latitude taxa is observed during the MECO and late Eocene warming event at Site 277. Radiolarian abundance, diversity and taxa with high-latitude affinities increase at Site 277 in two steps in the latest Eocene due to climatic cooling and expansion of cold water masses.\n\nAstronomical calibration of the geological timescale: closing the middle Eocene gap\n\nT.

Development of a highly accurate geological timescale for the Cenozoic Era has previously been hampered by discrepancies between radioisotopic and astronomical dating methods, as well as a stratigraphic gap in the middle Eocene. We close this gap and provide a fundamental advance in establishing a reliable and highly accurate geological timescale for the last 66 million years.\n\nFreshwater discharge controlled deposition of CenomanianâTuronian black shales on the NW European epicontinental shelf (Wunstorf, northern Germany)\n\nN.

The additional supply of organic matter, depleting oxygen upon degradation, and freshwater, inhibiting the mixing of oxygen-rich surface waters with deeper waters, caused the development of oxygen-poor waters about 94 million years ago.\n\nEarly Paleogene variations in the calcite compensation depth: new constraints using old borehole sediments from across Ninetyeast Ridge, central Indian Ocean\n\nB.

Here, the surface water experiences less seasonality in pH than the bottom water despite higher process rates. This is due to a substantial reduction in the acid-base buffering capacity of the bottom water as it turns hypoxic in summer. This highlights the crucial role of the buffering capacity as a modulating factor in pH dynamics.\n\nStable carbon isotope biogeochemistry of lakes along a trophic gradient\n\nA. de Kluijver, P. L.

About 34 million years ago, the Earth's climate experienced a climate transition from a greenhouse state to an icehouse state with the onset of ice sheets in Antarctica. Our study shows important productivity events in the Southern Ocean preceding this climatic shift. Our findings strongly indicate that the biological pump potentially played an important role in that past climate change.\n\nTracing North Atlantic volcanism and seaway connectivity across the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)\n\nMorgan T.

The gases released from volcanic eruptions and from sediments heated by the magma are believed to have caused severe climate changes in the geological past. We use a variety of volcanic and climatic tracers "
