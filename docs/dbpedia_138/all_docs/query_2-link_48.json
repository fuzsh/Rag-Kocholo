Committee on The Second Regional Plan 69 LIST OF TABLES AND MAPS 72 ... The future environment offers many big choices for public decision that will affect our whole way of life. But it is not the kind of choice available in a supermarket: selecting this or that item from among many independent products, according to personal taste at the moment. Our environment comes in enormous and expensive packages today, with the contents prede- termined and very difficult to exchange for something one might like better. The only way to affect it is by influencing the big decisions that produce the package. To do that it is necessary not only to know what we want but also to understand the possibilities and limitations of the production process, and how the various elements in the package fit together. Fortunately it is not the citizen-consumer's responsibility to acquire and apply this knowledge entirely on his own. Politicians, experts, critics, civic leaders, the press, all have important roles in translating the complexities of the physical environment into understandable terms and choices, a role which they have been fulfilling more and more in recent years. And iiplanning\" in a democratic society is primarily a means of propos4ng and explaining possible future packages for public acceptance, rejection or modification.

We may have to use'depth inter- views of those who serve as listening posts in slums- e.g., barbers and bartenders-rather than going di- rectly to large numbers of low-income people. We also will try to tap the observations of welfare workers, public housing managers, and leaders of organizations sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity. Representatives of major institutions Major institutions and groups directly concerned with regional planning issues, such as large corpora- tions and their professional advisers (i.e., lawyers, public relations firms), labor organizations, public and higher education, the arts, civil rights, information media, foundations, churches, architecture and build- ing, women's organizations, conservation and trans- portation, have great influence on regional planning decisions made by government. Their own actions are important, too, and these actions result from a difficult- to-trace blend of leadership, logic and followership. These institutions and major groups, therefore, are worth consulting through their spokesmen. Experts in planning-related fields Since regional planning aims at weaving together a dozen or more threads spun out by separate professions and industries-education, health, the arts, retailing, home building, ecology-conservation-recreation, indus- trial and office location, and more a good deal of discussion between regional planners and experts in these fields seems advisable. In many cases, these professions and industries are not planning for the future of the services they provide; in such instances, regional planners can stimulate them to look ahead and can provide economic and demographic projections on which planning for this segment of regional affairs can be based. In any case, the special conditions gov- erning each of these areas of activity must be known to the regional planner for his own work. Furthermore, the planner's way of looking at these activity areas should be known to the experts so they can respond thoughtfully to the final recommendations. In addition to experts in planning-related fields, the regional planner should consult professional planners for municipalities, counties and states. 4.

We do not expect unanimous approval of our recommendations. We shall, however, have a large working consensus. And we will know who disagrees and why they disagree and how serious the opposition is. Our regional plan will not go on the shelf, because it will already be in the blood stream of the Region's decision-makers before it is published. Progress Report on the Second Regional Plan, December 31, 1966. CONSULTING THE PUBLIC ON THE SECOND REGIONAL PLAN Acknowledgements In addition to Regional Plan Association staff members, the following made significant contributions to the Goals for the Region project described in Part II. On recruiting participants: David B. Rauch, then Director, Adult Education Program, Great Neck Public Schools; Pearl H. Hack, then Lecturer in Political Science, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York; George Case, public relations consul- tant; Hans Neurath, Case Supervisor of the Social Service Center of the City of New York. On preparing and analyzing questionnaires: Mrs. Sanci Michael of the Bureau of Applied Social Research, Columbia University, and Allen Barton, the Bureau Director; Joan Gordon, Research Director, Center for New York City Affairs, New School for Social Research; Joel I. Brooks, then with Elmo Roper and Associates. Dr. Barton also brought together a group of social scientists to review the plan of the project and gave a preliminary report on the results at the 1963 annual Regional Plan Conference. On producing the television series: Telic, Inc., (Elwood Siegel, President, and Edwin Bouton, Vice President and Executive Di- rector); WPIX (Edward M. Roberts, then Production Manager, Otis Freeman, then Vice President in Charge of Engineering, and Leavitt J. Pope, then Vice President in Charge of Operations). Participating in the television shows: Mason W. Gross, President of Rutgers -The State University; Mr. and Mrs. John W. Morris and their children (now of New Rochelle, New York); Dorothy H. Cronheim, then Director of the Newark Commission for Neigh- borhood Conservation and Rehabilitation; Mabel Walker, Execu- tive Director of the Tax Institute of America; L. Clinton Hoch, Partner, The Fantus Company (industrial locaters); Paul Windels, former Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. Probably most credit for the project's results belongs to the more than 600 chairmen of small groups around the New York Region who recruited their group members, arranged for meeting places, chaired the discussions and saw to it that written questionnaires were returned. Nearly half also gave us useful comments after the project was over on how public participation could be improved. 5.
