        "text": "As was suggested in the previous chapter, although W.F. Tillotson could claim to be the creator of the first major fiction syndicate in Britain, others were planning to enter the field almost before the ink was dry on the agreement with John Maxwell. By the mid1870s there were at least three other organizations selling serial fiction to provincial newspapers nationwide. From the middle of the following decade the Bolton firm was forced to modify its business strategies significantly in response to the activities of its rivals. It is important to distinguish here between narrower and broader definitions of the competition Tillotsons faced. Like all agents, Willie Tillotson was a middleman, first buying the serial rights to fiction from authors and then selling them on to a number of other newspaper proprietors. From Leader and Sons in 1873 to the Northern Newspaper Syndicate 20 years later, throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century there were agencies being created which tried to do more or less the same thing. But these direct competitors proved less of a threat to the Fiction Bureau than the indirect rivals who began to emerge after 1880. Some were the new professional London literary agents who normally did not buy and sell at all, but took a commission from the price paid by a wide range of publishers or further middlemen to the author."
