        "text": "Experimental procedures\n\nA schedule of experimental activities is provided in Table 1. In preparation for artificial insemination by a commercial operator, all ewes were treated using the following protocol. Intravaginal progesterone-releasing devices (Eazi-breed sheep and goat device CIDR; Pharmacia and Upjohn, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia) were inserted into ewes for 16 d then removed and each ewe injected with Folligon (1·5 ml/ewe; Intervet Australia Pty Ltd, Bendigo East, Vic, Australia). Approximately 25 h after CIDR removal, ewes were inseminated with semen from a single Poll Dorset sire. After insemination, the three flocks were grazed in separate paddocks in a rotational grazing system containing nine paddocks, with flocks being moved every 2–3 weeks. All ewes were ultrasonically scanned to determine their pregnancy status after 9 weeks. Thereafter, ewes in flock 1 were penned individually in an animal shed and fed a lucerne chaff diet (800 g/d) for 7 d. Commencing on day 8, each ewe was orally dosed with sodium 1-(2-sulfonatooxyethoxy) dodecane prepared as 100 ml 10 % solution from a stock of Empicol ESB/70AV (Allbright and Wilson Australia Ltd, Melbourne, Vic, Australia) to remove protozoa. Ewes were dosed on four consecutive days and feed was withheld during this period. Animals required 7 d to recover pre-drenching appetites after treatment was completed. The treatment dose was delivered with an oesophageal tube inserted into the rumen. After dosing, rumen fluid samples were collected (using an oesophageal tube) at weekly intervals from each ewe to check for the presence of protozoa. At 4 weeks after drenching, defaunated ewes were returned to the paddock. Flocks 2 and 3 remained in the rotational grazing system during this period. Protozoa status of the ewes was checked when lambs were weaned and again when ewes were shorn at the completion of the trial (Table 1). Defaunated ewes remained free of protozoa. Wool growth (greasy fleece weights) of the ewes was measured from September (year 1) to July (year 2), a period of 320 d.\n\nLambs were born within a 7 d period. All newborn lambs were identified to their dam, weighed and ear-tagged within 24 h of birth. At 4 weeks of age lambs were de-tailed, castrated, vaccinated for clostridial diseases (Tasvax; Schering-Plough Pty Ltd, Australia) and drenched with an anthelmintic (Cydectin; Fort Dodge Australia Pty Ltd, Baulkham Hills, NSW, Australia) to control internal parasites. Lambs received a second clostridial vaccination and anthelmintic drench at weaning (mean age 101 d). Ewes and lambs were weighed at 3-weekly intervals until weaning. The numbers of lambs weaned from flocks 1, 2 and 3 were thirty-eight, forty and forty respectively. Lambs were weaned into new paddocks for a period of 14 d before being individually penned in animal houses for controlled feeding and measurement of methane emissions.\n\nAfter weaning, two controlled feeding trials were conducted. In trial 1, lambs were given a high-concentrate ration; in trial 2, lambs were given an all-roughage ration.\n\nTrial 1\n\nProtozoa-free lambs (BF; n 38 and DF; n 40) were housed in individual pens in the same building while faunated lambs (F; n 40) were housed in individual pens in a separate building. Lambs were initially offered lucerne chaff and then gradually adapted to include sorghum-based pellets (13·7 or 20·7 % crude protein) that also contained 20 % cotton hulls and contained a trace mineral supplement (Animal Nutrition Products Pty Ltd, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia). The mineral and vitamin composition (expressed as a % of DM) of the high- and low-protein pellet was similar and was as follows: Ca, 6·2 g/kg; P, 4·3 g/kg; K, 7·6 g/kg; Na, 4·3 g/kg; S, 2·7 g/kg; Mg, 2·8 g/kg; Co, 0·28 mg/kg; Cu, 6·73 mg/kg; I, 0·56 mg/kg; Mn, 30 mg/kg; Se, 0·22 mg/kg; Zn, 41·73 mg/kg; vitamin E, 8·97 mg/kg; vitamin A, 1346 μg/kg. After removal of lambs for inappetence or health problems the final number of lambs were thirty-four lambs in the BF group, thirty-three lambs in the DF group and thirty-two lambs in the F group. Protozoa were removed from the DF lambs using the same surfactant-dosing protocol that was used for the ewes with the exception that the dosing rate varied with body weight (35 ml dose solution per 15 kg body weight). This procedure was subsequently repeated for all DF lambs using an increased dose rate (50 ml dose solution per 15 kg body weight) because not all lambs were defaunated with the initial dose. All lambs remained on their allocated diet during this period and lambs in the BF and F groups were fed to appetite. At 2 weeks after the defaunation treatment of the DF lambs had been completed, the daily ration was fixed at 800 g pellets (as fed) and 200 g lucerne chaff (as fed) and 10 g calcium chloride (Table 2). The restricted ration was fed for a period of 2 weeks before trial 1 commenced. The average age of the lambs at the commencement of trial 1 was 195 d and the average LW of the lambs in the BF, DF and F groups was 32, 26 and 30 kg respectively. Feed refusals were minimal during trial 1, with all lambs consuming in excess of 98 % of feed offered.\n\nTissue depth at the GR site (110 mm from the midline over the 12th rib) of all lambs was assessed manually during weighing. An Aloka 500 ultrasound scanner with a 3·5 MHz probe (Aloka, Wallingford, CT, USA) was used to determine loin muscle depth at the 12th rib and fat depth at the C-site (45 mm from the midline over the 12th rib). Lambs were weighed and scanned for loin muscle depth on day 1, day 35 and day 70 of the 10-week experimental period(Reference Hegarty, Shands, Marchant, Hopkins, Ball and Harden8). Rumen fluid samples were collected (using an oesophageal tube) from each lamb in week 5 and week 10 of the study. Samples of the rumen fluid sample were analysed for volatile fatty acids (VFA)(Reference Erwin, Macro and Emery9), ammonia concentration and visual enumeration of small ( < 125 μm) and large (>125 μm) holotrich and entodiniomorph protozoa using a Hawksley Cristalite B.S. 748 counting chamber (Lancing, Sussex, UK). Wool growth was estimated using the dye-band method of Chapman & Wheeler(Reference Chapman and Wheeler10). Dye-bands were applied on day 9 and day 70 of the experimental period. Following the removal of the dye-bands all lambs were shorn and fleece weights recorded.\n\nMethane emissions were measured from sixty lambs held in respiration chambers (n 4) during the final 3 weeks of the experimental period. Lambs were selected at random from those available to include five male and five female lambs from both the low- and high-protein dietary groups within each of the three treatment groups (BF, DF and F). Five lambs from each of the treatment groups were allocated to each of the four respiration chambers. The risk of chamber differences biasing treatment effects and the risk of transfer of protozoa from F to BF or DF lambs was minimised by F lambs being measured in chambers 3 and 4 on days 1–5 of measurement, and being measured in chambers 1 and 2 on days 11–15 of measurement. After day 5, chambers 3 and 4 were thoroughly cleaned to remove any residual protozoal cells that may have been present. At least one lamb from the high- and low-protein diet within each treatment group was allocated to each of the four chambers.\n\nMethane production was measured over a 21 h period for each lamb, with the daily ration being provided as the lamb was placed in the chamber. If animals refused more than 100 g of feed while in the chamber, measurement of methane emissions was repeated at a later time. Chambers were 1·1–1·3 m3 in volume, of polycarbonate construction with approximately 150 litres/min of external air drawn through the chamber by a side channel blower (Uni-jet 40CE; ESAM, Parma, Italy) as measured by a dry gas meter (AL-800; American Meter Company, Horsham, PA, USA). Air within the chamber was continuously circulated by a 30 cm diameter fan. Methane concentration in the incoming and outgoing air stream was measured at approximately 10 min intervals using an Innova 1312 Photoacoustic multigas monitor with moisture compensation (Innova Airtech Instruments, Ballerup, Denmark). Recovery of a dose of pure methane introduced to each chamber was tested and found to be within 98–101 %. Methane production was calculated as air flow multiplied by methane concentration in the effluent air, adjusted for methane concentration of the incoming air and temperature and atmospheric pressure in the chamber.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe superior performance of the defaunated ewes, producing heavier lambs at birth, supporting faster lamb growth and tending (P = 0·1) to produce more wool, despite a lower body weight during lactation, is consistent with reported studies of wool and lamb growth(Reference Bird and Leng12, Reference Ivan, Dayrell, Mahadevan and Hidiroglou13). Since one of the prime nutritional changes in livestock after defaunation is an increased amino acid supply(Reference Eugène, Archimède and Sauvant1), the breeding ewe is the ideal beneficiary of defaunation, with both wool production(Reference Reis and Schinckel14) and pre-weaning growth(Reference Walker and Cook15) typically limited by amino acid supply. That amino acid supply was limiting productivity of the grazing ewes was apparent from the lower wool growth of twin-bearing, compared with single-bearing ewes. It is assumed that the superior early postnatal growth of lambs born to defaunated ewes resulted from increased milk production and/or milk protein content, since lamb growth is highly sensitive to protein supply(Reference Black and Griffiths16) and defaunation increases milk production(Reference Moate and Farrell17) while lambs consume little pasture in the early postnatal period(Reference Langlands18). The continued superior growth of protozoa-free lambs up until weaning may again have been a consequence of greater protein supply, arising not only from greater milk protein intake, but also from differences in flow of dietary and microbial amino acids from the rumen(Reference Ushida, Kayouli, De Smet and Jouany19).\n\nProtein supply as manipulated by diet or protozoa did not affect indices of lamb body composition (loin muscle, tissue depth at GR site, C-fat depth), which is consistent with other studies of protein-supplemented weaned lambs(Reference Hegarty, Neutze and Oddy20). While body growth and compositional indices were similar for all combinations of dietary protein and protozoa status, growth of wool continued to respond to an increased protein supply produced by either dietary or protozoal treatments. The exception was wool production by DF lambs which did not differ from that of F lambs. The absence of a wool growth response in the DF lambs was probably due to low body protein reserves caused by the extended period of feed restriction and anti-protozoal drenching required to remove protozoa from these lambs before the commencement of performance trial 1.\n\nWithin the rumen, however, it was apparent that both diet and protozoa modified the fermentation, albeit in different manners. The absence of protozoa (BF) reduced total VFA concentration and decreased the acetate:propionate ratio, with increased acetate and reduced propionate proportions. The lower total VFA concentration may have resulted from decreased ruminal DM fermentation(Reference Veira21, Reference Ushida, Jouany, Demeyer, Tsuda, Sasaki and Kawashima22) as well as a greater percentage of fermented material being utilised in microbial cell synthesis rather than proceeding to VFA. A review of the literature(Reference Eugène, Archimède and Sauvant1) indicated that on average the molar proportion of propionate is lower in faunated than in protozoa-free ruminants (20·2 v. 23·1 molar %), but the changes in VFA following defaunation are not predictable(Reference Coleman23). The inconsistent effect of defaunation is exemplified in the studies of Christiansen et al. (Reference Christiansen, Kawashima and Burroughs24) and Males & Purser(Reference Males and Purser25) in which molar proportions of VFA were reported for faunated and defaunated lambs fed almost identical rations of lucerne and maize. In the former study the molar proportion of propionate in faunated lambs was 24·6 % and declined to 21·4 % in defaunated lambs, while in the latter study the molar proportion of propionate in faunated lambs was 23·3 % and increased to 30·3 % in defaunated lambs. The bacterial population is largely responsible for the fermentation of organic matter and the production of VFA and methane in the protozoa-free rumen. While it is known that the number of bacteria increase in the absence of protozoa(Reference Bryant and Small26) and the composition of the bacterial population changes(Reference Ozutsumi, Tajima, Takenaka and Itabashi27), the factors influencing the establishment and final composition of the bacterial population in the rumen following defaunation are not understood. Until more data become available on the composition of the bacterial population and corresponding measurement of VFA and methane in faunated and defaunated animals, our understanding of the relationship between defaunation and methane production will remain limited.\n\nWhile fermentation results were consistent with the existing understanding of stoichiometric relationships between VFA and methane production, the expected differences between faunated and defaunated sheep with respect to VFA proportions and methane emissions were not observed in these studies. A review of the literature(Reference Hegarty3) indicated that in the absence of protozoa, methane emissions were reduced by an average of 13 %, with reductions in methane emissions of up to 25 % being reported(Reference Finlay, Esteban, Williams, Embley and Hirt28). Hegarty(Reference Hegarty3) suggested that lower methane emissions from protozoa-free sheep can be attributed to one or more of the following: reduced DM fermentation in the rumen; increased incorporation of fermented DM entering microbial cells; hydrogen production reduced commensurate with lower acetate production; hydrogen consumption increased commensurate with increased propionate production. It is assumed that concomitant with these changes in the protozoa-free rumen, the population of methanogens is also reduced. The greater wool production observed in protozoa-free stock in the present studies implies reduced DM available for total VFA production but there is no evidence that the presence of protozoa affecting the pattern of fermentation in a way that would reduce rumen hydrogen supply and methanogenesis; in fact the data are contrary. Given the lack of a methane response in protozoa-free animals in these studies, it is pertinent to examine studies that have reported reduced methane emissions in defaunated animals.\n\nMost of the studies designed to measure methane production from faunated and protozoa-free animals have compared protozoa-free animals with animals that had either been initially defaunated and then refaunated or isolated at birth and then faunated. Results from these studies led to the conclusion that reduced methane emissions from the rumen could be achieved with the removal of protozoa, but little consideration was given to the fate of the rumen methanogen populations in the ciliate-free animals. It is known that some rumen methanogens have an endosymbiotic association with protozoa and it has been calculated that ciliate-associated methanogens may account for up to 37 % of the total methane production in the rumen(Reference Newbold, Lassalas and Jouany29). It was therefore not unreasonable to conclude that the reduced methane emissions from the ciliate-free animals were due to the loss of the ciliate-associated methanogens; however, the fate of the remaining population of methanogens needs to be considered. Newbold et al. (Reference Newbold, Lassalas and Jouany29) reported that the size of the methanogen population in rumen fluid collected from defaunated sheep and sheep that had been refaunated with mixed type B fauna(Reference Eadie30) was similar. In vitro production of methane (per unit of hexose fermented) was also similar for the type B fauna and ciliate-free incubations(Reference Newbold, Lassalas and Jouany29). Importantly, donor sheep used in the present study were given 6 months to adapt to the diet and fauna status before the study commenced, suggesting that the loss of the ciliate-associated methanogens in the defaunated animal has been compensated for by an increase in the population of the remaining methanogens. Therefore studies in which methane emissions have been measured in animals initially defaunated then measured again in the same animals when refaunated(Reference Whitelaw, Margaret Eadie, Bruce and Shand31–Reference Hegarty, Iqbal, Damry, Corbett, Choct, Nolan and Rowe33) may be a comparison of animals with temporarily low populations of methanogens (following defaunation treatment) and animals in which the methanogen populations have had time to recover and have been boosted with the refaunation inoculum (containing protozoa and bacteria), rather than a comparison of animals with and without protozoa. In the study of Kreuzer et al. (Reference Kreuzer, Kirchgessner and Muller34) methane emissions were initially measured in naturally faunated sheep and then repeated in the same animals following defaunation. Although Kreuzer et al. (Reference Kreuzer, Kirchgessner and Muller34) reported lower methane emissions in defaunated sheep, methane emissions were measured in the ciliate-free sheep just 8 d after the defaunation treatment so it was unlikely that methanogen populations had stabilised in this time. In a recent study, Yanez-Ruiz et al. (Reference Yanez-Ruiz, Hart, Belanche, Martin-Garcia and Newbold35) reported that at comparable daily feed intakes, ciliate-free lambs produced 26 % less methane than faunated lambs. In contrast to other studies, lambs were isolated from their mothers within 24 h of birth, reared in isolation and then inoculated at weaning with either fresh rumen fluid or centrifuged rumen fluid that had been frozen to produce faunated and ciliate-free animals respectively. Following inoculation, lambs were given 3 months to adapt to the diet and fauna status before methane emissions were measured. This is an interesting result because the 3-month period between inoculation and measurement should have been sufficient for the rumen methanogen population to stabilise. However, additional measurements are required to demonstrate that low methane emissions are maintained in the ciliate-free animals for an extended period of time. Further, it is not clear if the low methane emissions are due to the absence of protozoa or to the poor establishment of methanogens in animals that were isolated at birth from other ruminants.\n\nUntil it can be demonstrated that methane emissions are permanently lowered in ciliate-free animals relative to naturally faunated animals, defaunation cannot be confirmed as a strategy for reducing methane emissions from ruminants. The development of practical defaunation tools for the livestock industries remains desirable on the basis of enhanced livestock performance."
