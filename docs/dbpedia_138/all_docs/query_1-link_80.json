        "text": "Background: Although emergency departments provide acute care learning opportunities for medical students, student exposure to recommended curriculum presentations and procedures are limited. In this perspective, clinical environments providing learning opportunities for students should be monitored as part of an ongoing quality improvement process. This study aims to analyze student exposures and their involvement levels in two different hospitals (Tawam and Al Ain) so as to improve the teaching and learning activities. Methods: This is a prospective study on all 76 final year medical students' electronic logbooks (e-Portfolio) of the academic year 2016/2017. Results: Students recorded 5087 chief complaints and 3721 procedures. The average patient and procedure exposure in a shift per student in Al Ain Hospital compared with Tawam Hospital were 7.2 vs 6.4 and 5.8 vs 4.3, respectively. The highest full involvement with presentations was seen in the pediatric unit (67.1%, P < 0.0001). Urgent care shifts demonstrated the highest area of \"full involvement\" with procedures for our students (73.2%, P < 0.0001). Students' highest involvement with presentations and procedures were found during the night shifts (P < 0.0001, 66.5 and 75.1%, respectively). Conclusions: The electronic portfolio has proven to be a very useful tool in defining the learning activities of final year medical students during their emergency medicine clerkship and in comparing activities in two different clinical settings. Data collected and analyzed using this e-Portfolio has the potential to help medical educators and curriculum designers improve emergency medicine teaching and learning activities.\n\nActive observers can benefit vicariously from the experience of hands-on learners in simulation. Kolb’s experiential learning cycle and vicarious learning theory form the theoretical basis for directed observation during simulation teaching, although little is known about the impact of different simulation technologies on the observer experience. This mixed-methods crossover study compared student experiences as observers using a high-fidelity manikin and immersive virtual reality (VR) software. Forty-nine final-year medical students were divided into two groups, undertaking and observing scenarios using either the manikin or VR before switching to the other form of simulation. Forty-eight questionnaires comprising Likert items were completed and analysed, with 11 students participating in focus groups. As observers, the students reported similar experiences with regards to engagement and reflection, with no statistically significant difference between the two technologies. However, the manikin scored higher in domains such as realism, enjoyment, clinical reasoning, usefulness and improved confidence. Students found that ‘participating’ is a more useful experience than ‘observing’ in both technologies. Thematic analysis revealed themes such as skills development, learning experience and technology. Students valued observing their colleagues completing scenarios within both technologies, highlighting the benefits of observation in focus groups. The high-fidelity manikin scored higher for several domains; however, there was no difference between VR and high-fidelity simulation on perceived observation experience regarding engagement and self-reflection. This suggests VR may have a useful role in observational learning, without the need for a simulation suite.\n\nSimulation-based teaching is an integral feature within medical education and following the emergence of virtual simulation, an array of possibilities exists for educators to choose between. However, evidence informing their use is scarce, particularly regarding outcomes assessing user experience and knowledge acquisition, and experimental studies comparing different approaches to virtual simulation. Therefore, this study compared immersive virtual reality (VR) simulation to computerized virtual patient (VP) simulation measuring their effect on knowledge acquisition and retention, as well as user experience, in fifth-year medical students. This pilot study, of a randomized crossover design, comprised 18 participants independently completing an immersive VR simulation and a computerized VP simulation. All participants completed the same two scenarios and received an induction to both modalities. Multiple-choice questions were employed to assess knowledge acquisition and retention, with participants completing the questions immediately before and after the simulation and following a 12-week interval. User experience questionnaires were completed after the simulation, utilizing both Likert scale and open-ended questions. Statistical analysis comprised a Student’s Both interventions achieved statistically significant levels of knowledge acquisition and retention. However, VR simulation achieved higher levels of acquisition (2.11; 95% CI = 0.89, 3.32, The findings indicated that both interventions are effective and acceptable educational tools. However, learning does not appear to be uniform across different virtual simulators, with participants achieving higher levels of learning following immersive VR simulation. Moreover, participants reacted significantly more positively to VR simulation, though potential applications were identified for both interventions. This study highlights the importance of an evidence-based approach to the implementation of novel simulation technologies. The findings contribute to an underexplored area of the literature and offer a step towards enabling medical educators to make an informed decision regarding the application of virtual simulation in their context.\n\nSimulation (SIM) allows medical students to manage high-risk/low-frequency cases in an environment without patient risk. However, evidence for the efficacy of SIM-based training remains limited. To compare SIM-based training to traditional didactic lecture (LEC) for teaching medical students to assess and manage critically ill patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and anaphylaxis. Prospective, randomized, non-blinded crossover study of 28 fourth-year medical students. Students were oriented to the human patient simulator, then randomized to SIM or LEC between August and December 2007. The SIM group learned to manage MI using SIM training and the LEC group learned via PowerPoint lecture. All subjects' assessment and management skills were then evaluated during a simulation session of MI. During a second instruction session, the students crossed over and were taught anaphylaxis using the opposite modality and similar assessments were conducted. Completion of critical actions for each case were scored, converted to percentages, and analyzed via signed rank test. Of 28 subjects, 27 performed better when trained with SIM compared with LEC (p < 0.0001). Mean scores were 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91-95%) of critical actions completed for SIM and 71% (95% CI 66-76%) for LEC. Absolute increase for simulation was 22% (95% CI 18-26%). For three domains common to MI and anaphylaxis, simulation scores were higher for history (27%, 95% CI 21-38%), physical examination (26%, 95% CI 20-33%), and management (16%, 95% CI 11-21%). SIM training is superior to didactic lecture for teaching fourth-year medical students to assess and manage simulated critically ill MI and anaphylaxis patients."
