        "text": "Introduction\n\nRoots and rhizomes of emergent macrophytes commonly grow in anoxic, nitrate-deficient sediments, rich in phytotoxins such as iron (Fe2+), manganese (Mn2+), sulphides and organic acids; most species rely on diffusion through gas-spaces in shoots, rhizomes and roots for supplying respiratory O2 (Armstrong & Drew, 2002) and removing waste gases such as CO2 and ethylene. Diffusion also supports ROL from roots (Armstrong, 1964; Armstrong & Drew, 2002; Colmer, 2003) promoting nitrification (Kirk & Kronzucker, 2005) and bacterial and chemical detoxification of phytotoxins (Begg et al., 1994; Pedersen et al., 2004) in the rhizosphere. However, flowering plants such as water-lilies (Dacey, 1980; Grosse, 1996) and the common reed, Phragmites australis (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1990; Armstrong et al., 1992; Brix et al., 1992) also generate pressurized (convective) through-flows of air or ‘internal winds’ through their gas-space systems. These supply O2 (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1990; Armstrong et al., 1992) and vent waste gases (Brix et al., 1996) far more effectively than diffusion and, by conveying ‘fresh air’ to root–rhizome junctions, greatly increase oxygen (O2) diffusion to roots and ROL (radial O2 loss) to the rhizospheres (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1990; Armstrong et al., 1992). Consequently, greater numbers of roots can be supported and the penetration depth for rhizome and root growth can sometimes be doubled (Vretare-Strand, 2002).\n\nThis paper is concerned with humidity-induced convection (HIC) driven by a ‘molecular-pump’ which depends upon the inward diffusion of O2 and nitrogen (N2) through narrow (< 1 µm) stomatal pores highly resistant to pressurized backflow. (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1994; W. Armstrong et al., 1996a,b). The diffusion gradients are induced by humidification within the plant which reduces O2 and N2 concentrations below atmospheric levels. The inwardly diffusing gases, together with water vapour continually produced from substomatal cells, cause pressurization that drives gas flows (‘internal winds’) along the path of least resistance, through stem and rhizome, with venting through older, more porous parts of the plant (Dacey, 1980; J. Armstrong et al., 1996b). This HIC is powered by the latent heat of evaporation, to maintain humidity of the gas spaces, and is most rapid under warm, dry (low RH), sunny conditions (J. Armstrong et al., 1996b; Brix et al., 1996; Steinberg, 1996).\n\nPreviously, significant convective-flows have only been found in some wetland flowering plants. However, nonflowering vascular plants, such as the horsetails (Equisetopsida) have inhabited wetlands from the late Devonian to the present day (Boureau, 1964) and their aeration physiology has been a neglected topic. Giant tree-horsetails, the Calamites (Calamites and related genera), which are now extinct, co-dominated Carboniferous swamp forests at low elevations and latitudes, their massive rhizomes reaching depths of 1–2 m; plant remains slowly decayed to form coal, indicating that the sediments were anoxic (Weiss, 1925). In a living horsetail, Equisetum telmateia, rhizome penetration to 4 m in wet soils, has been reported (Husby, 2003). The aeration of these rhizomes has never been explained and we examined the possibility that convective aeration occurs in E. telmateia and that this type of ventilation could have taken place in the Calamites. Convective flow in E. telmateia was investigated in terms of induction sites, internal pathways, and rates of flow in relation to external relative humidity, wind speed, diurnal effects, rhizome resistance and dynamic pressure gradients along stems. We also examined the fossil record of the Calamites in terms of morphology and aeration anatomy and employed a mathematical model (Armstrong et al., 1991) to assess convective flow potential in these plants and its likely benefits.\n\nThe Equisetales and Calamitales are characterized by jointed, ridged stems, nodal whorls of jointed branches, microphyllous leaves at nodes and whorls of roots on rhizome nodes (Boureau, 1964); large aerenchymatous channels (vallecular canals) are found in the cortex of branches, stems, and rhizomes. Equisetum telmateia grows in nutrient-enriched wet soils, attains a height of 1–3 m (Fig. 4a) and has no secondary wood; roots are branched and covered in long root hairs. Shoots die back in winter forming persistent stubble. By contrast, the Calamites were trees (height 5–10 m or more, Fig. 5h,i) with trunks and massive rhizomes up to 75 cm diameter, and large amounts of secondary wood (Boureau, 1964; Fig. 5e). Whereas the microphyllous leaves of Equisetum are relatively colourless, fused and vestigial, those of the Calamites were numerous, prominent and generally free, attaining lengths of c. 5–50 mm (Thomas, 1912; Boureau, 1964; Fig. 5c). It is almost certain that Calamite leaves, having a huge composite surface area, were the principal organs of photosynthesis, but in E. telmateia it is the branches that perform this function. Fine branches of the Calamites also bore stomata (Boureau, 1964) and may have photosynthesized.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nE. telmateia: convective flow rates in relation to shoot height, branch numbers and parts of branches\n\nShoot height Convective flow rate increased with shoot height (Fig. 1a). For tall shoots (height > 130 cm) very high convective flows of 60–103 cm3 min−1 were attained under warm, dry sunny conditions. For shorter shoots (< 40 cm) flow rates were often lower than 10 cm3 min−1. Before standardizing for humidity and temperature the highest flow rate recorded was 120 cm3 min−1.\n\nBranch numbers With single excised nodes, successive removal of branches and sealing the wounds resulted in gradual reductions in convective flow rates (Fig. 1b). The ΔPs remained largely unaffected until all the branches had been removed, when it fell to zero (data not shown). Removal of all branches resulted in zero flow rates; the same was true of whole shoots; also, for single nodes and whole shoots, flow rates were approximately proportional to total branch lengths (not shown). These results indicate that convective flow is initiated in the branches and not in the main stem or rudimentary nodal leaves. In general, the highest flow rates were associated with the tallest shoots, which have the most numerous and longest branches.\n\nParts of branches The gradual covering of the branches of individual nodes with jelly showed that apical parts must contribute less to overall flow than more basal regions (Fig. 1c) as covering 20% of the apical branch system reduced flows by only 6% and a 33% coverage produced only 18% reduction in flow. The basal two-thirds of the branch system could deliver 82% of the total flow. Static pressures were also lowered when the more basal parts of the branches were coated; the effect was slight when apical parts were covered (not shown). These effects were no doubt the result of incomplete formation of aerenchyma in the apical parts of branches, extra resistance in the aeration path from apex to base and competitive interaction from the more basal segments (Beckett et al., 2001). The same principle must also apply to the smaller contributions to flow from the apical as opposed to the basal branches of a shoot (see also the section on pressure gradients).\n\nE. telmateia: convection in relation to relative humidity, wind-speed and time of day\n\nEffect of relative humidity on convection rates from whole shoots For whole excised shoots (Fig. 2a) convective flows were inversely related to external humidities and decreased approximately to zero around 100% RH.\n\nEffect of RH on convection rates and ΔPs of single nodes For excised nodes, results were similar to those for whole shoots. Flow rates and ΔPs were inversely related to RH (Fig. 2b).\n\nResults shown in Figs. 2a and 2b can be explained in terms of humidity-induced convection, HIC (as described in the Introduction), initiated in the branch stomata (induction sites) and conveyed to the main stem.\n\nEffect of wind-speed Convective flow rates increased rapidly with increasing flows of air past the shoots of up to approx. 3 cm s−1 owing to the removal of humid air from around the shoots; removal of the boundary-layer steepens diffusion gradients for HIC. However, at wind speeds > 3 cm s−1 there was little further increase in flow, probably because of the sculpturing of branch surfaces, making removal of a close boundary layer difficult; a cooling of the plant could also have played a part.\n\nDiurnal effects As expected from the relationships between convective flow rates and relative humidity, flow rates tended to be high around midday, under dry, warm, sunny conditions (Fig. 2d). Flow rates fell sharply as the sun went down and humidity increased, approaching zero at 20 : 00 h with 90% RH and staying as such through the night. With the sun rising and humidity decreasing, flow rates increased, but the cloudy conditions and higher RH on the second day resulted in slower flows than previously. These results no doubt also correlate with some stomatal opening and closure. Oxygen production arising from the fixation of CO2 carried in the transpiration stream could be expected to supplement any HIC pressurization.\n\nDuring the night there had been exudation from the cut stems; this was removed in order to obtain the reading at 06 : 00 h.\n\nE. telmateia: convective flow rates and pressure differentials for shoots excised and reconnected to stubble, dynamic pressure gradients and nodal branch contributions to flow\n\nShoots excised and reconnected to stubble Convective flow rates of excised shoots were higher than those attained when the shoot was reconnected to the stubble (Fig. 3a). Potential flows were reduced by an average of 61% for the shoots examined; similarly, static pressures were higher than dynamic pressures by 40% (Fig. 3b). These effects were caused by resistances within and back-pressures from the rhizome system. For all shoots investigated, there was always a net flow from the shoot into the rhizome system. Despite these reductions in flow when shoots were reconnected to the rhizome system, there were still considerable flows into the bed of generally 8–15 cm3 min−1 even at comparatively high RH (53–77%) and from medium-sized shoots. These values are greater than the average free flow rates for excised Phragmites shoots (Table 1).\n\nPhragmites australis Equisetum telmateia Calamites Shoot height (m) 2.33 ± 0.1 1.23 ± 0.05 20–30 Area of convecting surface per shoot (m2) 0.03 ± 0.002 0.3 ± 0.05a 900c Stomatal frequency per mm2 on convecting surface 861 ± 54 110 ± 14 440d Total stomatal numbers on convecting surface per shoot c. 2.6 × 107 c. 3.3 × 107 c. 4.0 × 1011c Length of stomatal aperture, surface view (µm) 10–12 35–40 10–14e Total length of stomatal apertures per shoot (m) 286 1238 4.8 × 106c Ratios 1 4.3 16 783 Convective flow rate per excised shoot (cm3 min−1) 8.5 ± 1.1 59 ± 3.6 c. 70 000f Ratios 1 7 8235 Maximum convective flow rate for single excised shoot (cm3 min−1) 17 120b n.a. Maximum internal ‘wind velocity’ (cm s−1) 1.5 10 > 11f\n\nAs expected, the relationship between FB/Ff and the delivery coefficient, 1 − ΔPd/ΔPs was close: for the 18 shoots tested, FB/Ff was 0.414 ± 0.16 SD and the delivery coefficient was 0.405 ± 0.13 SD. This confirms that the more easily obtained delivery coefficient is a suitable means of assessing the relative ventilating contribution of shoots in the field.\n\nDynamic pressure gradients and resistance down shoots in situ In intact shoots, dynamic pressures (ΔPd) decreased from tip to base along a curvilinear gradient (Fig. 3d) indicating that all branches contribute to the flow. However, apical branches were the least effective, no doubt because of their shorter lengths, incomplete aerenchyma formation, extra resistances in the train and competitive interaction from lower branches. The ΔPd increased the greater the distance from the basal venting point. The very steep rise in the resistance towards the shoot apex reflects the narrowing and smaller cross-sectional area of the aerenchyma channels.\n\nNodal branch contributions to overall flow Branch systems from the apical third of the shoot contributed far less to the overall flow than those from the basal two-thirds (Fig. 3e). This is similar to the spatial distribution of flow contribution in individual branches (cf. Fig. 1c). It is no doubt because of the shorter branch lengths near to the apex coupled to the greater resistance to flow, as well as the back-pressure generated from the lower nodes. The latter effect can be appreciated by comparing the actual flows from the main shoot compared with its potential flow derived by summing the individual free-flows from the excised portions. The small contribution to overall flow of the lowest nodes (nodes 1–5) reflects the shorter and fewer branches frequently found here.\n\nGas-space continuity and anatomy\n\nEquisetum telmateia At low pressures air could be artificially blown through rhizome aerenchyma channels (Fig. 4h) and out of cut stem or cut branch aerenchyma (Fig. 4g,e). At higher pressures (0.6–2 kPa) it was possible, via the rhizome, to blow air out of stomata on intact branches (Fig. 4b–d), from scale leaf stomata on intact rhizome apices, and out of gas spaces of cut roots (Fig. 4i). At the maximum pressures induced by humidity-induced diffusion (ΔPs 800 Pa) stem nodal diaphragms prevented pressurized gas-flow through the pith. Air blown through stem aerenchyma could vent through the interconnected stubble of the previous year. These interconnecting aerenchyma channels (vallecular canals) of branches, stem and rhizome, having low flow resistance, provide the pathways for convective aeration.\n\nThe stems are smooth but the branches bear microscopic projecting barbs which appear to interlink with branches of neighbouring shoots and help to keep these delicate structures intact. However, high winds and heavy rain can cause damage and collapse of the stands. Nevertheless, even after such weather, although a high proportion of the stems are bent, they are still sufficiently intact to induce significant convective flows. As in Phragmites, we have observed that the plant readily produces callus to seal wounds and prevent leakages from the shoot gas-space system to the outside.\n\nAnatomical observations correlated with those on gas-space interconnections described above. Branch stomata lead to large substomatal cavities (Fig. 4c) and via intercellular spaces to aerenchyma channels which form a continuous gas-transport pathway through mature parts of branches (Fig. 4e), the main stem (Fig. 4g) and rhizome (Fig. 4h) and cortical intercellular spaces of roots (Fig. 4i) which appear to form a simple schizogenous aerenchyma. Branches typically have four or five aerenchyma channels, whereas the stem and rhizome contain c. 30 and 10, respectively. Throughout the shoot and rhizome, aerenchyma channels of one internode bifurcate at the node and so lead directly to two aerenchyma channels of the succeeding internode (Fig. 4f); because of these bifurcations, all the aerenchyma channels interconnect at the nodes. There are no intervening nodal diaphragms, and this results in pathways of low resistance to gas flow. There appear to be only very small intercellular connections between the pith cavity and aerenchyma; the pith cavity is interrupted by nodal diaphragms a few cells thick with small intercellular spaces and of very low porosity. This correlates with the high pressure-flow resistance of pith cavities mentioned previously.\n\nStomata (Fig. 4b–d) are situated in rows along the edges of grooves on branches; density is c. 110 mm−2. The subsidiary cells which overarch the guard cells have the comb-like thickenings on the inside surface of their walls (Fig. 4d), typical of the genus Equisetum. From several electron micrographs of sections of stomata (not shown) we estimate that the narrowest region of the pore is c. 0.2 µm wide. This corresponds to the narrowest part of the stomatal pore for Phragmites and is close to the optimum for humidity-induced convective flow, as shown by both physical and mathematical models (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1994; W. Armstrong et al., 1996a,b). Minute papillae on the outer surface of the subsidiary cells also surround the stomatal pore (Fig. 4b,d; see also Page, 1972) and, interestingly, the distance between those closest to the pore also appears to be c. 0.2–0.3 µm. Consequently, we suggest that these papillae may also facilitate the convective flow.\n\nThe Calamites There were large pith cavities in stems (Fig. 5e), rhizomes and certain roots (Seward, 1898; Eggert, 1962; Boureau, 1964). It is uncertain whether pith cavity diaphragms were porous, but, particularly below ground, the pith probably connected with aerenchyma channels via infranodal canals (Boureau, 1964; Williamson, 1871). Leaves (Fig. 5d: Thomas, 1912), stems (Seward, 1898; Eggert, 1962; Boureau, 1964), rhizomes (Boureau, 1964), roots (Fig. 5f,g; Stewart, 1983; also Eggert, 1962; Boureau, 1964) and probably older stems (Fig. 5e; Stewart, 1983; also, Weiss, 1925; Steur, 2006) were aerenchymatous and it seems unlikely that the gas spaces in these organs were not interconnected. Although evidence of aerenchyma in older stems is comparatively rare, this might have been caused by callus occluding spaces in damaged tissues before fossilisation: callus is frequently found in E. telmateia and other wetland species such as Phragmites (J. Armstrong et al., 1996c). Also, since the tissues were apparently delicate and would initially have contained air, this could have made aerenchymatous outer layers prone to early decay.\n\nIn the Calamites stomata were present on the abaxial surfaces of leaves and on fine branches (Boureau, 1964). The stomata closely resembled those on Equisetum branches in terms of form, the presence of papillae (Fig. 5b; Good, 1971) comb-like thickenings of subsidiary cells and large substomatal cavities (Fig. 5a; Thomas, 1912). Apparently stomata were small relative to those of E. telmateia, but their density was higher c. 440 mm−2 (Thomas, 1912), which is around four times that for E. telmateia branches. We suggest that the huge number of Calamite leaves (Fig. 5c; Thomas, 1912) would have been major induction sites for convective flows, possibly with fine branches having a minor role, and with venting through dead/broken trunks or branches.\n\nMathematical modelling of Calamite aeration\n\nCalamite trunks apparently lacked lenticels, but there may have been some O2 diffusion into the rhizome via basal leaf scars in older plants and via shoot/leaf stomata close to ground level in young shoots. However, even assuming relatively low respiratory O2 demands (e.g. 10 ng cm−3 s−1: 312 µmol m−3 s−1), no root production on the new rhizome and a relatively high effective porosity (e.g. 50%), Eqn 2 predicts that diffusion alone could have supported no more than a metre of rhizome growth in total: 0.5 m penetration into the sediment, plus 0.5 m upward growth to re-establish contact with the atmosphere just before which O2 concentration in the tip would be close to zero. With an even lower rhizome respiratory demand and no roots (e.g. 5 ng cm−3 s−1) 1.75 m of rhizome growth might have been achieved: diffusive penetration depth 0.875 m. Greater penetration might have been facilitated eventually by extra shoots providing parallel diffusion pathways as in Fig. 5h. Without basal diffusive aeration (i.e. if O2 only diffused from leaves on a crown > 1–2 m above the soil surface) Eqn 2 indicates that rhizome growth below ground would have been negligible.\n\nConvective ventilation, however, can maintain close to atmospheric O2 concentrations within rhizomes for long periods, especially during the day (Armstrong & Armstrong, 1990; Armstrong et al., 1992), and compared with diffusion, permits greater rhizome penetration and rooting depth (Vretare-Strand, 2002; Sorrell & Hawes, 2009): in theory, the penetration limit should be close to that of L in Eqn 2. The presence of roots as depicted in Fig. 5h,i could have raised oxygen demands to at least 50 ng cm−3 s−1 and it is difficult to explain how these roots could have grown and their continuing oxygen requirements been supported without high levels of oxygen in the rhizome system. At present, the only way we can explain this is by assuming convective ventilation through the rhizome system.\n\nFor modelling purposes, we likened the Calamite leafy crown to a group of E. telmateia-like shoots blowing into a trunk and rhizome system. A tree such as that in Fig. 5e had approx. 10 branches per node and approx. 30 branched nodes in the lower two thirds of the crown. If each branch bore the equivalent of 10 functional Equisetum-like shoots, this would amount to 3000 such shoots per crown. Using what we believe to be conservative estimates for flow rates because of humidity within the crown (25 cm3 min−1 per shoot at a dynamic pressure of 120 Pa; see Fig. 3d), the total flow could amount to 70 l air min−1 per tree (Table 1). Because the aerenchyma channels in the branches and trunks were individually of high cross-sectional area, the pressure flow resistances would have been very low (e.g. only 3 × 10−3 MPa s m−3 m−1; Fig. 5e). This would place little additional restriction on the flow from the pressure-generating crown shoots themselves. Flow velocities in the trunk and rhizome aerenchyma channels may have been as high as 11 cm s−1.\n\nThe predicted effects on trunk and rhizome aeration of such flows reveal minimal O2 depletion even over pathlengths of 10 m (Fig. 6) and would readily explain how such extensive rooting (Fig. 5h,i) from already deeply growing rhizomes apparently occurred in anaerobic swamp soils. Indeed Fig. 6 also shows that O2 concentrations close to 25% (i.e. > 0.8 that in the Carboniferous atmosphere) could have been achieved with internal flow velocities of only 1 cm s−1). Convective flows should also have enabled a much faster exploitation of sediment depth than a diffusion-reliant system and could be expected to have been of competitive benefit to the plants.\n\nFinal comments\n\nIt has been shown here that extraordinarily high convection rates occur in a living relative of the Calamites, the great horsetail E. telmateia. Flows pass along interconnecting aerenchyma channels of low resistance to gas flow, in branches, stem and rhizome, with venting through the previous year's stubble. Generated by a ‘molecular pump’ involving internal humidification and humidity-induced diffusion of air through branch stomata, these ‘internal winds’ of ≤ 120 cm3 min−1 per shoot (internal wind-velocity ≤ 10 cm s−1) are seven times greater than the highest previously recorded flows for individual Phragmites shoots (Table 1) and even greater than for a leaf of the giant water-lily, Victoria amazonica (Grosse, 1996). Such high rates of flow in E. telmateia are no doubt correlated with a large stomatal surface area per shoot, long stomatal apertures, distribution of stomata on fine branches which easily move in the wind thereby reducing boundary layer effects for HIC and an internal pathway of low resistance. Other possible factors contributing to high flow rates, and requiring further investigation, include the closely packed papillae on the subsidiary cells which might aid resistance to backflow, and possibly a high degree of internal humidification aided by high root pressures; the latter is indicated by the rapid exudation of sap from cut stems.\n\nThe Calamites, in terms of morphology, stomatal structure and aeration anatomy, resembled E. telmateia, indicating that they too probably generated pressure flows. It seems likely that the leaf aerenchyma in Calamite leaves (Fig. 5d: Thomas, 1912) facilitated convection; it could have had no significance for diffusion to rhizomes via several metres of trunk. Our modelling indicates high flow-rates, perhaps 70 l min−1 per tree, being realized (Table 1) and that convective flow could have been necessary for aerating their massive, prolifically rooting rhizomes. In view of the close anatomical and morphological similarities between living and extinct species of the Equisetaceae, it seems highly probable that convective aeration will also have occurred in some extinct members (Equisetum/Equisetites) dating back to the Permian.\n\nThe pathway of humidity-induced convection in E. telmateia and the suggested route in Calamites are shown in Fig. 7. It is interesting that in comparing Phragmites, E. telmateia and the Calamites, estimations of total lengths of stomatal aperture per plant broadly relate to rates of convective flow in the first two species and with modelling predictions for convection rates in Calamites (Table 1).\n\nWe have also recently measured convective flows in Equisetum japonicum, Equisetum giganteum and Equisetum palustre: rates per excised stem in E. japonicum and E. giganteum were much slower than for E. telmateia, but in relation to its size E. palustre, exhibited relatively fast flows. We could find no evidence of convection in Equisetum arvense and other reports indicate that there is no significant flow in Equisetum fluviatile (Equisetum limosum) (Barber, 1961; Hyvonen et al., 1998; Vretare-Strand, 2002). Interestingly, E. palustre is similar to E. telmateia in having rows of tightly-packed papillae impeding the diffusion path to the stomatal pores (Fig. 4b), whereas this is not the case in species such as E. arvense and E. fluviatile (Page, 1972).\n\nEquisetum telmateia tends to grow in soils with running water and, of the wetland Equiseta in the UK, is said to be the least tolerant of sediment anoxia (Page, 2002) while E. fluviatile is considered the most tolerant. In view of the appreciable convective flows that are generated in E. telmateia this may at first seem somewhat paradoxical. However, the roots we examined were always short (L < 100 mm) and, although possessing some schizogenous aerenchymatous space, were of relatively low porosity. The presence of long, persistent root hairs (Fig. 4j) was also a characteristic feature, but rather unusual for a wetland plant. Roots of this type might require high rates of convection through the rhizome to be sufficiently aerated to support such root hairs and possibly to promote rhizosphere nitrification under waterlogged conditions (Uchino et al., 1984). We suggest that convective flows in E. telmateia are also necessary to aerate rhizomes and roots in deeper horizons. Perhaps a slow metabolic rate, cold soil conditions and porous diaphragms might account for the success of the apparently diffusion-dependent E. fluviatile. Clearly, more research is needed to investigate other aspects of the aeration physiology of this ancient plant group such as the effects of convective flow on rhizome and root growth in E. telmateia, and the possibility of Venturi-induced convections in other species. Additionally, it could be interesting to examine further the aeration anatomy of the tree Lycopods (e.g. Lepidendron) which, with the Calamites, were codominants in the Carboniferous swamp forests. These Lycopods were supported on raft-like ‘root’ systems (the stigmarian axes) bearing numerous spirally arranged highly aerenchymatous rootlets. According to Weiss (1925) some stigmarian axes had an aerenchymatous middle cortex and gas-space connection to the stem. Oxygen diffusing from the stem and from upwardly growing rootlets (Bond, 1962) might have been sufficient to maintain aerobic metabolism in below-ground parts."
