        "meta_description": "Abstract. During the summer of 2011, the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) recovered over 900 m of overlapping core from 3 different sites in late Paleocene to early Eocene fluvial deposits of northwestern Wyoming. BBCP cores are being used to develop high-resolution proxy records of the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2) hyperthermal events. These events are short-term, large magnitude global warming events associated with extreme perturbations to the earth's carbon cycle. Although the PETM and ETM2 occurred ~55â52 million years ago, they are analogous in many ways to modern anthropogenic changes to the carbon cycle. By applying various sedimentological, geochemical, and palynological methods to the cores, we hope to better understand what caused these events, study the biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks that operated during them, and reveal precisely how they impacted continental environments.  Core recovery was >98% in all holes and most drilling was carried out without fluid additives, showing that continuous coring of continental smectitic deposits like these can be achieved with minimal risk of contamination to molecular biomarkers. Cores were processed in the Bremen Core Repository where the science team convened for 17 days to carry out data collection and sampling protocols similar to IODP projects. Initial results show that the weathered horizon extends to as much as ~30 m below the surface and variations in magnetic susceptibility within the cores record an interplay between grain size and pedogenesis. Previous investigations of outcrops near the BBCP drill sites allow detailed evaluation of the effects of weathering on common proxy methods. Studies of lithofacies, organic geochemistry, stable isotope geochemistry, calibrated XRF core scanning, paleomagnetics, and palynology are underway and will represent the highest resolution and most integrated proxy records of the PETM from a continental setting yet known. An extensive outreach program is in place to capitalize on the educational value associated with the Bighorn Basin's unusually complete record of Phanerozoic earth history.",

These data also provide important climate context for the extensive early Eocene mammal fossil record from the southern Bighorn Basin and support previous hypotheses that pulses in mammal turnover corresponded to the ETM2 and H2 hyperthermals.\n\nSynchronizing early Eocene deep-sea and continental records â cyclostratigraphic age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project drill cores\n\nThomas Westerhold, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Roy H.

Past, 14, 303–319, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-303-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-303-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present a high-resolution timescale synchronization of continental and marine deposits for one of the most pronounced global warming events, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred 56 million years ago. New high-resolution age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) drill cores help to improve age models for climate records from deep-sea drill cores and for the first time point to a concurrent major change in marine and terrestrial biota 54.25 million years ago.\n\nTransient micropaleontological turnover across a late Eocene (Priabonian) carbon and oxygen isotope shift on Blake Nose (NW Atlantic)\n\nJulia de Entrambasaguas, Thomas Westerhold, Heather L.

By analysing the fossil microorganisms that lived in the water column and the ocean floor, as well as reconstructing the ancient ocean's biogeochemistry, we were able to trace longitudinal shifts in the Gulf Stream during the late Eocene (36 Ma). Our results provide insight into the Gulf Stream's behaviour and the NW Atlantic's palaeoceanography during the Late Eocene (ca. 36 Ma).\n\nPaleozoic Equatorial Records of Melting Ice Ages (PERMIA): calibrating the pace of paleotropical environmental and ecological change during Earth's previous icehouse\n\nJonathan M.

This section contains a relatively complete record of Upper Carboniferous to Early Permian sediments, providing a unique window on Earth's last icehouse–hothouse transition. Ongoing research will tie our results to important fossil sites, allowing us to better understand how this climate shift contributed to the evolution of terrestrial life.\n\nICDP workshop on the Deep Drilling in the Turkana Basin project: exploring the link between environmental factors and hominin evolution over the past 4 Myr\n\nCatherine C.

To organize goals for coring, we hosted a workshop in Nairobi, Kenya, which focused on how a 4 Myr sedimentary core from Turkana will uniquely address research objectives related to basin evolution, past climates and environments, and modern resources. We concluded that a Pliocene to modern record is best accomplished through a two-phase drilling project.\n\nPaleogene Earth perturbations in the US Atlantic Coastal Plain (PEP-US): coring transects of hyperthermals to understand past carbon injections and ecosystem responses\n\nMarci M.

Coastal plain sediments can resolve this uncertainty, but their discontinuous nature requires numerous sites to constrain events. Workshop participants identified 10 drill sites that target the PETM and other interesting intervals. Our post-drilling research will provide valuable insights into Earth system responses.\n\nPlanning for the Lake Izabal Basin Research Endeavor (LIBRE) continental scientific drilling project in eastern Guatemala\n\nJonathan Obrist-Farner, Andreas Eckert, Peter M.

Burberry, Anders Noren, Amy Myrbo, Matthew Lachniet, Nigel Wattrus, Derek Gibson, and the LIBRE scientific team\n\nSci. Dril., 32, 85–100, https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-32-85-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-32-85-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn August 2022, 65 scientists from 13 countries gathered in Antigua, Guatemala, for a workshop, co-funded by the US National Science Foundation and the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program. This workshop considered the potential of establishing a continental scientific drilling program in the Lake Izabal Basin, eastern Guatemala, with the goals of establishing a borehole observatory and investigating one of the longest continental records from the northern Neotropics.\n\nVehicle-based in situ observations of the water vapor isotopic composition across China: spatial and seasonal distributions and controls\n\nDi Wang, Lide Tian, Camille Risi, Xuejie Wang, Jiangpeng Cui, Gabriel J. Bowen, Kei Yoshimura, Zhongwang Wei, and Laurent Z. X. Li\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3409–3433, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand the spatial and temporal distribution of vapor isotopes, we present two vehicle-based spatially continuous snapshots of the near-surface vapor isotopes in China during the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. These observations are explained well by different moisture sources and processes along the air mass trajectories. Our results suggest that proxy records need to be interpreted in the context of regional systems and sources of moisture.\n\nNature and origin of variations in pelagic carbonate production in the tropical ocean since the mid-Miocene (ODP Site 927)\n\nPauline Cornuault, Thomas Westerhold, Heiko PÃ¤like, Torsten Bickert, Karl-Heinz Baumann, and Michal Kucera\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 597–618, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-597-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe generated high-resolution records of carbonate accumulation rate from the Miocene to the Quaternary in the tropical Atlantic Ocean to characterize the variability in pelagic carbonate production during warm climates. It follows orbital cycles, responding to local changes in tropical conditions, as well as to long-term shifts in climate and ocean chemistry. These changes were sufficiently large to play a role in the carbon cycle and global climate evolution.\n\nPrecessional pacing of tropical ocean carbon export during the Late Cretaceous\n\nJi-Eun Kim, Thomas Westerhold, Laia Alegret, Anna Joy Drury, Ursula RÃ¶hl, and Elizabeth M. Griffith\n\nClim. Past, 18, 2631–2641, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2631-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2631-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study attempts to gain a better understanding of the marine biological carbon pump and ecosystem functioning under warmer-than-today conditions. Our records from marine sediments show the Pacific tropical marine biological carbon pump was driven by variations in seasonal insolation in the tropics during the Late Cretaceous and may play a key role in modulating climate and the carbon cycle globally in the future.\n\nIntegrating plant wax abundance and isotopes for paleo-vegetation and paleoclimate reconstructions: a multi-source mixing model using a Bayesian framework\n\nDeming Yang and Gabriel J.

Past, 18, 2181–2210, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2181-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2181-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlant wax lipid ratios and their isotopes are used in vegetation and paleoclimate reconstructions. While studies often use either type of data, both can inform the mixing pattern of source plants. We developed a statistic model that evaluates ratios and isotopes together. Through case studies, we showed that the approach allows more detailed interpretations of vegetation and paleoclimate than traditional methods. This evolving framework can include more geochemical tracers in the future.\n\nTerrestrial carbon isotope stratigraphy and mammal turnover during post-PETM hyperthermals in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA\n\nSarah J. Widlansky, Ross Secord, Kathryn E. Snell, Amy E. Chew, and William C. Clyde\n\nClim. Past, 18, 681–712, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-681-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-681-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew stable isotope records from pedogenic carbonates through the ETM2, H2, and possibly I1 hyperthermals from the Bighorn Basin highlight significant spatial variability in the preservation and magnitude of these global climate events in paleosol records. These data also provide important climate context for the extensive early Eocene mammal fossil record from the southern Bighorn Basin and support previous hypotheses that pulses in mammal turnover corresponded to the ETM2 and H2 hyperthermals.\n\nClimate, cryosphere and carbon cycle controls on Southeast Atlantic orbital-scale carbonate deposition since the Oligocene (30â0 Ma)\n\nAnna Joy Drury, Diederik Liebrand, Thomas Westerhold, Helen M. Beddow, David A. Hodell, Nina Rohlfs, Roy H. Wilkens, Mitchell Lyle, David B. Bell, Dick Kroon, Heiko PÃ¤like, and Lucas J. Lourens\n\nClim.

During ~ 30–13 Ma, eccentricity (orbital circularity) paced carbonate deposition. After the mid-Miocene Climate Transition (~ 14 Ma), precession (Earth's tilt direction) increasingly drove carbonate variability. In the latest Miocene (~ 8 Ma), obliquity (Earth's tilt) pacing appeared, signalling increasing high-latitude influence.\n\nICDP workshop on the Lake Tanganyika Scientific Drilling Project: a late Mioceneâpresent record of climate, rifting, and ecosystem evolution from the world's oldest tropical lake\n\nJames M. Russell, Philip Barker, Andrew Cohen, Sarah Ivory, Ishmael Kimirei, Christine Lane, Melanie Leng, Neema Maganza, Michael McGlue, Emma Msaky, Anders Noren, Lisa Park Boush, Walter Salzburger, Christopher Scholz, Ralph Tiedemann, Shaidu Nuru, and the Lake Tanganyika Scientific Drilling Project (TSDP) Consortium\n\nSci. Dril., 27, 53–60, https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-27-53-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/sd-27-53-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur planet experienced enormous environmental changes in the last 10 million years. Lake Tanganyika is the oldest lake in Africa and its sediments comprise the most continuous terrestrial environmental record for this time period in the tropics. This workshop report identifies key research objectives in rift processes, evolutionary biology, geomicrobiology, paleoclimatology, paleoecology, paleoanthropology, and geochronology that could be addressed by drilling this globally important site.\n\nJoint inversion of proxy system models to reconstruct paleoenvironmental time series from heterogeneous data\n\nGabriel J. Bowen, Brenden Fischer-Femal, Gert-Jan Reichart, Appy Sluijs, and Caroline H. Lear\n\nClim. Past, 16, 65–78, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-65-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-65-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPast climate conditions are reconstructed using indirect and incomplete geological, biological, and geochemical proxy data. We propose that such reconstructions are best obtained by statistical inversion of hierarchical models that represent how multiâproxy observations and calibration data are produced by variation of environmental conditions in time and/or space. These methods extract new information from traditional proxies and provide robust, comprehensive estimates of uncertainty.\n\nScientific drilling of Lake Chalco, Basin of Mexico (MexiDrill)\n\nErik T.

The field location, in the densely populated, water-stressed, Mexico City region, gives this record particular societal relevance. The record also contains a rich record of volcanic activity; knowledge of the history of the area's explosive volcanic eruptions will improve capacity for risk assessment of future activity.\n\nTechnical Note: A global database of the stable isotopic ratios of meteoric and terrestrial waters\n\nAnnie L. Putman and Gabriel J. Bowen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4389–4396, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4389-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4389-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe an open-access, global database of stable water isotope ratios of various water types. The database facilitates data archiving, supports standardized metadata collection, and decreases the time investment for metanalyses. To promote data discovery and collaboration, the database exposes metadata and data owner contact information for private data but only permits download of public data. Two companion apps support digital data collection and processing and upload of analyzed data.\n\nLate Miocene to Holocene high-resolution eastern equatorial Pacific carbonate records: stratigraphy linked by dissolution and paleoproductivity\n\nMitchell Lyle, Anna Joy Drury, Jun Tian, Roy Wilkens, and Thomas Westerhold\n\nClim. Past, 15, 1715–1739, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1715-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1715-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean sediment records document changes in Earthâs carbon cycle and ocean productivity. We present 8 Myr CaCO3 and bulk sediment records from seven eastern Pacific scientific drill sites to identify intervals of excess CaCO3 dissolution (high carbon storage in the oceans) and excess burial of plankton hard parts indicating high productivity. We define the regional extent of production intervals and explore the impact of the closure of the Atlantic–Pacific Panama connection on CaCO3 burial.\n\nThe DeepMIP contribution to PMIP4: methodologies for selection, compilation and analysis of latest Paleocene and early Eocene climate proxy data, incorporating version 0.1 of the DeepMIP database\n\nChristopher J.

Previously, we outlined the experimental design for climate model simulations. Here, we outline the methods used for compilation and analysis of climate proxy data. The resulting climate atlas will provide insights into the mechanisms that control past warm climate states.\n\nIsotopic reconnaissance of urban water supply system dynamics\n\nYusuf Jameel, Simon Brewer, Richard P. Fiorella, Brett J. Tipple, Shazelle Terry, and Gabriel J. Bowen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6109–6125, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6109-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6109-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPublic water supply systems (PWSSs) are important infrastructure susceptible to contamination and physical disruption. In general, PWSSs are analyzed using hydrodynamic models, which requires detailed supply infrastructure information. In this paper, we have shown that stable isotope mixing models can also provide useful information on PWSSs. The method developed here can be useful in studying decentralized PWSSs, validating hydrodynamic models and solving water right issues.\n\nColorado Plateau Coring Project, Phase I (CPCP-I): a continuously cored, globally exportable chronology of Triassic continental environmental change from western North America\n\nPaul E.

The cores have abundant zircon, U-Pb dateable layers (210–241 Ma) that along with magnetic polarity stratigraphy, validate the eastern US-based Newark-Hartford astrochronology and timescale, while also providing temporal and environmental context for the vast geological archives of the Triassic of western North America.\n\nDynamics of sediment flux to a bathyal continental margin section through the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum\n\nTom Dunkley Jones, Hayley R. Manners, Murray Hoggett, Sandra Kirtland Turner, Thomas Westerhold, Melanie J. Leng, Richard D. Pancost, Andy Ridgwell, Laia Alegret, Rob Duller, and Stephen T. Grimes\n\nClim.

Here we document a major increase in sediment accumulation rates on a subtropical continental margin during the PETM, likely due to marked changes in hydro-climates and sediment transport. These high sedimentation rates persist through the event and may play a key role in the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by the burial of organic carbon.\n\nPaleoceanography and ice sheet variability offshore Wilkes Land, Antarctica â Part 1: Insights from late Oligocene astronomically paced contourite sedimentation\n\nAriadna Salabarnada, Carlota Escutia, Ursula RÃ¶hl, C.

Strother, Ulrich Salzmann, Dimitris Evangelinos, AdriÃ¡n LÃ³pez-QuirÃ³s, JosÃ© Abel Flores, Francesca Sangiorgi, Minoru Ikehara, and Henk Brinkhuis\n\nClim. Past, 14, 991–1014, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-991-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-991-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we reconstruct ice sheet and paleoceanographic configurations in the East Antarctic Wilkes Land margin based on a multi-proxy study conducted in late Oligocene (26–25 Ma) sediments from IODP Site U1356. The new obliquity-forced glacial–interglacial sedimentary model shows that, under the high CO2 values of the late Oligocene, ice sheets had mostly retreated to their terrestrial margins and the ocean was very dynamic with shifting positions of the polar fronts and associated water masses.\n\nDetection and variability of combustion-derived vapor in an urban basin\n\nRichard P. Fiorella, Ryan Bares, John C. Lin, James R. Ehleringer, and Gabriel J. Bowen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 8529–8547, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8529-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8529-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFossil fuel combustion produces water; where fossil fuel combustion is concentrated in urban areas, this humidity source may represent ~ 10 % of total humidity. In turn, this water vapor addition may alter urban meteorology, though the contribution of combustion vapor is difficult to measure. Using stable water isotopes, we estimate that up to 16 % of urban humidity may arise from combustion when the atmosphere is stable during winter, and develop recommendations for application in other cities.\n\nSynchronizing early Eocene deep-sea and continental records â cyclostratigraphic age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project drill cores\n\nThomas Westerhold, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Roy H.

Past, 14, 303–319, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-303-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-303-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we present a high-resolution timescale synchronization of continental and marine deposits for one of the most pronounced global warming events, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred 56 million years ago. New high-resolution age models for the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) drill cores help to improve age models for climate records from deep-sea drill cores and for the first time point to a concurrent major change in marine and terrestrial biota 54.25 million years ago.\n\nReinforcing the North Atlantic backbone: revision and extension of the composite splice at ODP SiteÂ 982\n\nAnna Joy Drury, Thomas Westerhold, David Hodell, and Ursula RÃ¶hl\n\nClim. Past, 14, 321–338, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-321-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-321-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNorth Atlantic Site 982 is key to our understanding of climate evolution over the past 12 million years. However, the stratigraphy and age model are unverified. We verify the composite splice using XRF core scanning data and establish a revised benthic foraminiferal stable isotope astrochronology from 8.0–4.5 million years ago. Our new stratigraphy accurately correlates the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and suggests a connection between late Miocene cooling and dynamic ice sheet expansion.\n\nTropical Atlantic climate and ecosystem regime shifts during the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum\n\nJoost Frieling, Gert-Jan Reichart, Jack J. Middelburg, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Thomas Westerhold, Steven M. Bohaty, and Appy Sluijs\n\nClim. Past, 14, 39–55, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-39-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-39-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPast periods of rapid global warming such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum are used to study biotic response to climate change. We show that very high peak PETM temperatures in the tropical Atlantic (~ 37 ÂºC) caused heat stress in several marine plankton groups. However, only slightly cooler temperatures afterwards allowed highly diverse plankton communities to bloom. This shows that tropical plankton communities may be susceptible to extreme warming, but may also recover rapidly.\n\nAstronomical calibration of the Ypresian timescale: implications for seafloor spreading rates and the chaotic behavior of the solar system?\n\nThomas Westerhold, Ursula RÃ¶hl, Thomas Frederichs, Claudia Agnini, Isabella Raffi, James C.

We used cyclic variations in the data caused by periodic changes in EarthÃ¤s orbit around the sun as a metronome for timescale construction. Our new data compilation provides the first geological evidence for chaos in the long-term behavior of planetary orbits in the solar system, as postulated almost 30 years ago, and a possible link to plate tectonics events.\n\nEvery apple has a voice: using stable isotopes to teach about food sourcing and the water cycle\n\nErik Oerter, Molly Malone, Annie Putman, Dina Drits-Esser, Louisa Stark, and Gabriel Bowen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We used a novel sampling system to measure the stable isotopes of H and O in the fruit water to determine its geographic origin by comparing it to maps of isotopes in rain. We used this approach to teach an audience of science students and teachers about water cycle concepts and how humans may modify the water cycle through agriculture and irrigation water diversions.\n\nRevisiting the Ceara Rise, equatorial Atlantic Ocean: isotope stratigraphy of ODP Leg 154 from 0 to 5â¯Ma\n\nRoy H.

To accomplish these goals, in 2015 we carried out a scientific drilling project on Lake Towuti, located in central Indonesia. We recovered over 1000 m of core, and our deepest core extended 175 m below the lake floor and gives us a complete record of the lake.\n\nMaastrichtian carbon isotope stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy of the Newfoundland Margin (Site U1403, IODP Leg 342)\n\nOliver Friedrich, Sietske J.

Therefore, we used an expanded deep ocean record from the North Atlantic that shows distinct sedimentary cyclicity suggesting orbital forcing. A high-resolution carbon-isotope record from bulk carbonates allows to identify global trends in the carbon cycle. Our new carbon isotope record and the established cyclostratigraphy may serve as a future reference site.\n\nEnvironmental impact and magnitude of paleosol carbonate carbon isotope excursions marking five early Eocene hyperthermals in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming\n\nHemmo A.

Paleohydrological changes of four smaller warming episodes are revealed to be the opposite of those of the largest, most-studied event. Carbon cycle tracers are used to ascertain whether the largest event was a similar event but proportional to the smaller ones or whether this event was distinct in size as well as in carbon sourcing, a question the current work cannot answer.\n\nThe Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project: inferring the environmental context of human evolution from eastern African rift lake deposits\n\nA.

Development of a highly accurate geological timescale for the Cenozoic Era has previously been hampered by discrepancies between radioisotopic and astronomical dating methods, as well as a stratigraphic gap in the middle Eocene. We close this gap and provide a fundamental advance in establishing a reliable and highly accurate geological timescale for the last 66 million years.\n\nOrbitally tuned timescale and astronomical forcing in the middle Eocene to early Oligocene\n\nT.
