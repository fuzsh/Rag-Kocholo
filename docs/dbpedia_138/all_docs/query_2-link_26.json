children should not be seen at home or in the presence of family members when making enquiries into forced marriage or parents contacted and alerted in advance of initial assessments, this puts the child(ren) at greater risk, as per the ‘Home Office Practice Guidelines for Forced Marriage’; a professional interpreter should always be used to support the work with children and young people; review the arrangements for monitoring attendance and escalating concerns for children who are missing education, and test these against the possibility of some future event resulting in the closure of school buildings and lessons moving online; where there is an allegation of rape of a child, the forensic examination of smart devices should be a priority action; when a Forced Marriage Protection Order is made, consideration should be given to taking fingerprints, DNA sample and photograph and whether the order can be beyond the child’s 18th birthday;
