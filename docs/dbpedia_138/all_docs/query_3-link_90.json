        "text": "I’ve become recently pretty obsessed with the artist Wang Nen Jun, but I can find very little information on his/her technique. Actually, I haven’t even been able to figure out whether the artist is male or female, that’s how surprisingly little data is available online.\n\nI’d like to do a couple of studies in this style, and I’m positive it was painted indirectly, but I’m having trouble with the order of color glazes and whether it was painted in a grisaille or verdaccio, or even something closer to a brunaille. I’m hoping someone with more experience in indirect painting will chime in, but I’d love to know what everyone thinks. TIA\n\n“I'm drawing a picture in my mind of what's on your mind.

I keep it bookmarked for reference. David Gray and Scott Waddell are two of my favorites.\n\nI was sort of afraid it was verdaccio. I get so turned around with verdaccio. It’s a real weak point for me.\n\nSidbledsoe, I know! It’s really a shame the artist hasn’t received more international recognition (that I can tell) because his work is just breathtaking and insight into his process would be valuable. Thank you for the links!\n\n“I'm drawing a picture in my mind of what's on your mind.

A professional painter, graduated from the Chongqing Arts and Crafts School in 2001. In 2008, he graduated from the “Integrated Painting Language” seminar of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Currently living in Beijing. Good at realistic oil painting. The work is in a realistic way. Desolation! Ethereal, using the faces of modern people, the costumes of the ancients, through the dramatic concept to express the artist’s fear of nature and the modern understanding of the traditional.\n\nChinese name\n\nWang Nengjun\n\nCountry of Citizenship\n\nChina\n\nNationality\n\nHan nationality\n\nplace of birth\n\nChongqing\n\ndate of birth\n\nApril 2, 1982\n\nThis can be done in all kinds of ways: starting with a verdacchio, grisaille or brunaille. The key to this look is layering and blending. Tons of blending.\n\nThe exact order of layers isn’t of utmost importance. You can get the greens (for instance) by using a verdacchio and leaving that somewhat visible. You can also use subtle greens in your overpaintings. Or you could place a thin, light skin color scumble over a darker area, as this will ‘cool’ the color of your overpainting.\n\nWithout seeing the painting in real life or without having detailed close ups of of it – especially the transition areas from dark to light – it is impossible to tell what the exact method has been. But, again, it doesn’t matter very much since there are multiple methods to use. I’d recommend experimenting to find a method that best suits you. Good luck!\n\nYou can get the\n\nLuuk\n\nInstagram\n\nWebsite"
