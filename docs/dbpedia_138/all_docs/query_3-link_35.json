        "text": "Not often i leave bad reviews but this is an absolute must - please READ ALL\n\nWORTH READING ALL!!!!\n\nWe arrived at the bungalow, paid in cash a fair amount considering the quality of the accommodation ad the fact it was low season.\n\nWe asked for several consumables from the onsite bar , none of which were available.\n\nI've stayed in Cambodia many times and for that fact do not expect luxury.\n\nThis stay was far from even basic. The staff were rude when we had problems, we did not feel welcome. a little boy unlocked our room and told us NOTHING about the bungalow.\n\nThe bathroom was absolutely appalling, i was shocked. I understand there are insects in Cambodia however it seemed that half the ant population lived in the bathroom.\n\nThe sink was blocked which i had to unblock with my bare hands as it was night time when i wanted to brush my teeth and we were not offered 24 hour customer service or told where the owners or managers stayed if we had problems, what was blocking the sink looked like a years worth of hair. The shower drain looked like a scene out of a SAW movie, I don't even know what blocked that and i didn't want to attempt to find out. It was apparent they were unaware of how to clean a bathroom. Toilet roll on floor, dirt around toilet.\n\nAll the ledges and sides were covered in dust, grime, hair, twigs, and dirt. I'm no cleaner but one might say that is the most basic and simple thing when it comes to cleanliness.\n\nThe mirror had what looked like some sort of mould growing in the corners.\n\nFor those of you that have stayed on islands, you will know mosquito nets are important.\n\nWell, to be quite frank, I would have been better off sleeping in a hatching mangrove swamp.\n\nThere were stains all over the nets, whether they were blood, bodily fluids, i dread to think.\n\nAs for the holes, well there was definitely no shortage there, not small ones either.\n\nAnd for the GRAND FINAL, because the mosquito net did not even close, at 3 AM in the morning, i rolled over to hear a meowing , felt wet on my arm and side, put the torch that i had wisely brought on, and it was then that I realised it appeared i was covered in a cats bodily fluids and blood who had somehow climbed through a wooden barred window and been able to access the bed due to the poor excuse of a mosquito net and started giving birth in my bed.\n\nI love cats and maybe it could have been a magical moment but a peaceful retreat at the price i paid, i did not expect to pay to roll around in a stray cats blood and bodily fluids.\n\nThe bed was soaked with this and my partner immediately vacated to the balcony to sleep whilst i had to help the cat.\n\nSo you would think some sort of compensation for this horrific experience would have been provided right? Instead we had several rude Khmer's shouting and telling us 'Not our cat, not our problem'.\n\nWhen i even suggested $10 which was a tiny percentage of our stay we were laughed at and denied such thing.\n\nI will not stay here again and NEVER recommend this place.\n\nThe staff are rude, careless and completely unacceptable. I've stayed in better dollar a night hostels.\n\nRead more"
