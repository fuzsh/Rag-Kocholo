B. Hibben, U.S. Navy, by order of the commandant of that yard, Capt. R. W.

It has been prepared entirely from the official manuscripts, books, and documents of the Navy Department, and is therefore reliable history.\n\nSecond.

Meade Sept. 15, 1887 --------------\n\n* Died in office.\n\n** Temporary.\n\n« Resigned commission, civil war impending, and was dismissed from the service by President Lincoln.\n\n§ Captain of the yard on the retirement of Rear Admiral Queen and succeeded to the duties until the close of his official term.\n\n--19--\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nOrganization of six navy-yards by Secretary Stoddert, in view of a permanent navy--One navy-yard located at Washington--Architect Latrobe's specification of original plan of the yard First residence built occupied by Captain Cassin, second officer.\n\nShortly before the close of the administration of John Adams, second President of the United States, a great national exigency arising from French aggression upon our commerce, assisted by an eloquent appeal of Benjamin Stoddert, Secretary of the Navy, to the House of Representatives, induced Congress on the 25th of February, 1799, to make an appropriation of $1,000,000 for the building of six of the largest ships of war. That the object of this appropriation should be more speedily and economically accomplished, together with the design of creating a permanent navy, the Navy Department, in the latter part of the year 1799, proceeded to apply a portion of this appropriation to the purchase and improvement of selected grounds for six navy-yards, located as follows: One at New York, one at Philadelphia, one at Boston, one at Portsmouth, one at Norfolk, and one at Washington.\n\nWe propose to write a history of the yard located at the Capital of the Nation and known as the Washington Navy-Yard. The grounds were originally purchased for $4,000. They consist of 40 acres of rolling land lying on the \"Eastern Branch \" of the Potomac River.\n\nThis yard was designed originally, to use the language of Secretary Stoddert, \"for capacious building and dock yard,\" and for many years was regarded as one of the most important and defensible and the one most useful, convenient, and necessary to the Government and Navy Department, and as early as October 1, 1801, the Government had expended $54,683 in improvements at this yard, a sum largely in excess of that appropriated to any one of the other navy-yards up to this date, and on January 20, the following year, timber for the 74-gun ship, stores, and other materials for building had been purchased to the amount of $158,683.\n\nAREA PLAN OF WASHINGTON NAVY-YARD.\n\nThe following is a detailed description or specification of the original plan of Washington Navy-Yard, prepared by B. H. Latrobe, architect and surveyor of the public buildings of the United States at\n\n--21--\n\nWashington, and approved by the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith, in the year 1804-'05:\n\nTHE GATE.\n\nThe design of the main gate of entrance to the navy-yard has been made with a view to the greatest economy compatible with permanence and appearance worthy of the situation. This gate will fall exactly into the range of the Georgia avenue as well as of the Eighth street east of the Capitol, one of the principal streets of this part of the city. I propose that it be built of that species of durable freestone which is only half of the price of that used in the Capitol, and which, though not of so fine a grain, is quite as strong and capable of resisting the weather.\n\nThe ground plan shows that the quantity of freestone proposed to be used is small, little exceeding that which would be required by a common set of solid gate-pieces.\n\nThe guard-rooms, within the yard, I pray to erect in brick. The columns being rendered perfectly steady by the weight of the entablature, and having the hinges laid through the joints, are by far the best means of securing the whole gate in its proper place, whether it be an open iron gate or a solid wooden one.\n\nWHARVES.\n\nOn account of the small water-front, an immense quantity of land must be made in order to get at the channel along the front of the wharf. The most essential part of the navy-yard is the wharf front. The wooden wharves of our cities, however excellent be their construction, have taught us this lesson, that they must gradually, yet inevitably, be protruded into the river. The wharf at this city has indeed failed, and has prematurely burst forward, on account of its faulty construction; but had it been ever so well built, the gradual decay of the upper logs and the pressure of the made ground behind the whole front would, in time, have acted to the same effect as at Philadelphia.\n\nI therefore strongly recommend that the wharf front be erected on piles and built of solid masonry and that the floor of the wharf be vaulted. This work will be expensive, but will secure durability for centuries, a solid foundation for stores and buildings of all kinds required close to the wharf front, and a certainty of deep water along the front.\n\nIt is not necessary that the whole extent of wharves should be erected at once.\n\nThe first should be built a little above the present wharf, adjacent to the channel, but so as to have the use of the present front during its erection.\n\nOne hundred and fifty feet front will be enough to accommodate two frigates. When this is finished and rendered useful, the second length should be erected in front of the present wharf and extended to the corner of the building slips. Afterward 150 feet per annum may be added until the work is completed.\n\nTwenty feet from the wharves is the best situation for the store-houses of the ships laid up. *\n\nFIRST USE OF THE DERRICK CRANE.\n\nThe crane erected in front of each store will take out and put in the masts of a 74-gun ship and do all the business for which shears have been employed. The crane is now used for this purpose at the East India and West India docks below London, and it is unnecessary to dwell on their immense utility.\n\nBUILDING SLIPS.\n\nThe building slips are proposed to occupy the situation already appropriated to them westward of the wharves. Three of them converge towards the channel. I have already given verbal information as to the best manner of constructing these slips.\n\n___________\n\n* Laid up in dry-dock.\n\n--22--\n\nTHE CANAL.\n\nTo the north of the building slips I propose to construct, or rather to leave, a spacious canal to enter the center of the lower part of the yard. This canal, if found liable to fill up, must be kept open by dredging. Its great utility is to get at the stores containing heavy articles and at the anchor smiths' shop by water. On this canal, close to the mouth, the boat-builder may be most properly placed. East of the boat-builder the mast-maker will receive and launch his spars with great facility by means of the canal. On the south side of the canal, close to the ships, I have placed the carpenter's shop, in which the carver may also have his workshop.\n\nTIMBER-SHEDS, PUMP, BLOCK MAKER, ETC.\n\nOpposite the slips and nearly in place of the present shed I have placed the deposit of the timber, for which I have allowed ample space. Opposite to the head of the land is the forge; near the forge are the pump and block maker and plumber, and on the north of the canal the riggers and artificers, who must have frequent communication with each other, and whose articles are heavy and can most advantageously be carried to and from the ships by water. Behind the ship stores I have allotted a large open space as a useful deposit of a variety of things not requiring to be housed or can not immediately be put under cover. North of this space, and very convenient to the ship stores, is the cooper's shop. An open square is formed by the cooper's shop, the ordnance stores, and the buildings to the north opposite to the forge, in the center of which is the office of the clerk of the yard.\n\nIt is evident, on inspection of the plan, that no situation is more commanding than this or so easy of access from all the different shops and stores.\n\nThe present buildings along the east wall I propose to convert into provision stores. For as they are less accessible from the water side than the rest, they ought not to contain bulky articles, but such only as can be easily moved on a dray. Contiguous to these stores I have located the place for the bake-house, slaughter-house, and salting-house buildings, which are nuisances and which will probably not be required for many years if provisions are to be procured at the best market, which is to the northward.\n\nThe sail lofts are placed contiguously to the riggers. The naval stores, composed in a great part of very combustible material, are deposited along a canal leading to the north. This is at present a large bay, the western part of which may be retained as a timber dock, though I am convinced that in a few years no timber for ship-building will be suffered to remain in the water after its arrival longer than it can be stored on shore. For it will be found that though timber remains hard and apparently sound while immersed in water, it will commence rapid decay as soon as taken out.\n\nCOMMANDANT'S HOUSE.\n\nIn the center of the upper part of the yard I propose that the first officer of the yard shall reside, as does the commissioner of the King's yard in England and the intendant formerly in France. From this situation the whole yard is under his eye. The second officer I propose shall inhabit that now occupied by Captain Cassin.\n\nIf there be a third officer, a house similar to Captain Cassin's may be erected west of the principal gate. The eastern portion of the yard will then be under the complete inspection of these officers.\n\nIn front of these buildings is an open space, on the south side of which, and opposite to the lands that separate the stores, comfortable dwelling-houses for all the master artificers should be erected. They will be thus placed immediately in view of the Captain Commandant of the yard and at the same time have a perfect inspection of all the shops and stores from their south fronts.\n\n--23--\n\nThis plan received the approval of the Secretary of the Navy and was gradually carried into execution, but with frequent interruptions, and with such modifications and exceptions as will be indicated in the course of this history.\n\nThe house above mentioned as occupied by Captain Cassin was one of the pioneer buildings of the yard.\n\nIt was built under the supervision of Captain Tingey by the firm Levering and Dyer, in the fall of 1801. The order for the contract was issued by the Secretary of the Navy on 10th of October, 1801.\n\n--24--\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCapt. Thomas Tingey ordered to the command of the Washington yard--\"Peace establishment\" act of Congress reducing the Navy--Bad results--Supplementary amendment act--Activity of the yard--Improvements--Regulations--Jefferson's gun-boats--The old navy.\n\nOn the 23d of May, in the year 1799, Secretary Stoddert appointed Mr. William Marbury, of Annapolis, Md., naval agent for the District of Columbia. The Secretary in his instructions informs Mr. Marbury that it had been determined to build one of the 74-gun ships, before named, at Washington.\n\nYour duty will be to contract for all materials wanted for this ship and for the Navy Department generally in the District, and you will be allowed 2 per cent, commission upon all moneys expended by you.\n\nOn the 2d of October of the same year the purchase of the grounds for the site of the Washington Navy-Yard having been completed, Naval Constructor Josiah Humphreys, then residing at Philadelphia, was ordered to Washington to select the proper spot for the wharf, and assist Mr. Marbury with his advice in the construction of the same.\n\nOn the 22d of January, 1800, Capt. Thomas Tingey, of Kingston, N. J., was appointed as superintendent of the yard. The following letter to Marbury from Secretary Stoddert, indicating the duties of the superintendent, we find in general letter-book:\n\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, January 22, 1800.\n\nWM. MARBURY, Georgetown:\n\nSIR: Capt. Thomas Tingey, of the Navy, an officer of great merit in our service, has been ordered to Washington with a view to superintend the building of the 74-gun ship, and to aid in the arrangement of the navy-yard, the improvements of which he will also superintend. The money, as heretofore, will pass through your hands. Captain Tingey being a man of understanding and having seen the navy-yards of England, will be able to direct the layings of that in Washington to greatest advantage.\n\nMr. Marbury continued to act as navy agent to July 9, 1801. Upon the election of Mr. Jefferson to the Presidency, Mr. Stoddert retired and Mr. Robert Smith, of Maryland, succeeded him as Secretary of the Navy. The new Secretary immediately abolished the office of navy agent for the yard and included its duties in those of the superintendent, Captain Tingey, thus very much increasing his authority and responsibility. Under the new order, Captain Tingey was required to superintend all the public buildings and improvements, to receive all public\n\n--25--\n\nproperty of all kinds deposited in his custody and to be responsible for their safe-keeping and expenditure thereof. All the officers and others on board of the ships in ordinary at Washington were to consider Captain Tingey as the agent of this Department and to respect his authority accordingly. As a compensation for such services he was to be entitled to receive the full pay, without the rations, of a captain commanding a ship of 32 guns and upwards. The pay of a captain in such command was $100 per month and eight rations per day.\n\nUnfortunately, the policy inaugurated under the administration of President Adams of creating and maintaining a navy was violently opposed by the Republican party upon one ground or another.\n\nConsequently, on the succession of Mr. Jefferson to the Presidency, March 4, 1801, Congress immediately proceeded to manifest its opposition by the enactment of a law looking rather in the direction of a gradual and permanent abolition of the navy than its permanent establishment and increase.\n\nFortunately, a remnant of the navy survived; and when Mr. Jefferson retired from the Presidency, leaving the legacy of a war with Great Britain to his successor, even what was left us of a navy saved the country at least from entire and absolute humiliation, and probably from political destruction.\n\nThis act of Congress above mentioned was entitled \"An act providing for a peace establishment.\"\n\nOne of the numerous theories of Mr. Jefferson involved the idea that war is unnecessary, and upon the assumption that a powerful navy is a continual challenge to war, Congress proceeded to emasculate it by the enactment of the peace establishment act.\n\nAmong other provisions it directed the President to discharge all the naval officers of the United States except 9 captains, 36 lieutenants, and 150 midshipmen.\n\nThe number of captains on the active list at this time was 28, Captain Tingey being twelfth on the list. This law would therefore seem necessarily to cut off Captain Tingey from the list. The United States Naval Chronicle, however, on page 389, gives the name of Thomas Tingey as still retained among the list of captains. But, in order to do this, it makes the list of captains 13, instead of 9 in number as retained in the Navy after the passage of the peace establishment law, without any explanation.\n\nBut if the peace law of 1801 took away from him his office as captain in the Navy, as it probably did, we find that he retained his office of superintendent of the navy-yard up to 1803, when his nominal relationship to the yard was changed to that of financial agent, but only for a short period; and that in 1804, by a direct act of Congress, his suspended or doubtful relation to the Navy was removed and his name was added to the list of captains and he was regularly appointed as Commandant of the yard with all its appurtenances.\n\n--26--\n\nThe peace establishment act of 1801 authorized the sale of all the ships and vessels belonging to the Navy except thirteen frigates. Of the frigates six only should be kept in commission, and the remaining seven should be dismantled, and laid up in ordinary with the following crew permanently attached to each ship:\n\nOne sailing master, also to act as purser and to superintend the ship; 1 boatswain, 1 gunner, 1 carpenter, 1 cook, a sergeant and 8 marines, and 12 seamen.\n\nUnder the provision of this law there were lying in ordinary at the Washington Navy-Yard in the year 1802 the following-named frigates, and warrant officers to the same, with a full complement of seamen and marines attached to each ship:\n\nList of warrant officers, etc., on. board the ships in ordinary in the Eastern Branch,\n\nNovember 20, 1802.\n\nFrigate United States, 44 guns: Ralph Izard (midshipman), acting as master.\n\nThomas Decordy, acting gunner.\n\nWilliam Hunter, acting boatswain.\n\nMatthew Welch, acting carpenter. President, 44 guns: William Knight, sailing-master, warrant.\n\nJohn H. Swoope, acting gunner.\n\nJames Fry, acting carpenter. Congress, 36 guns: David Phipps, sailing-master, on liberty.\n\nJames P. Mix, acting gunner.\n\nConrad Buskin, acting boatswain.\n\nRobert Smith, acting carpenter.\n\nIn view of future events in our history \"the peace act\" as a whole proved to be an unwise and unfortunate enactment, and even the section of the law which ordered that the greater portion of our ships be laid up in ordinary at the Washington Navy-Yard, with an idle crew permanently attached to each idle and decaying vessel, proved to be equally unwise and practically defective in many respects, and in January, 1804, Capt. John Cassin, in command of the ordinary, presented substantially the following array of objections to the present arrangement to the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith:\n\nFirst. A squadron of men being on board each ship, there must necessarily be a fire for heating and cooking purposes, and in proportion to the number of fires is the danger from suffering from them. Under present system we consume annually about one hundred and thirty cords of wood and one thousand bushels of coal.\n\nSecond. The officers have little or no employment, and on experience has demonstrated that even good officers will degenerate if not actively employed.\n\nTime is lost in collecting the men scattered among the various ships when their general presence is required. Much time of the men is unavoidably employed in cleaning up their own dirt, and dirt is a powerful auxiliary in rotting ship. While\n\n--27--\n\nat sea, the warrant and petty officers have important duties to discharge, but the ships in ordinary having been dismantled in the absence of rigging, sails, cables, spars, guns, etc., none of these officers have a single article under their charge except the master, who under my superintendence has the general charge of the ships.\n\nLastly, experience has evinced the inexpediency of requiring masters to perform the duties of pursers.\n\nCaptain Cassin then, in a letter of great length, suggests a plan to remedy the defective workings of the existing system. This plan in brief is: (1) To discontinue, the service of certain officers and men found to be superfluous. (2) Instead of attaching a certain crew permanently to each ship, as \"the peace law\" directs, to enter the men for the general service of the yard and to assign them to one ship for quarters. (3) To retire the officers discontinued upon half-pay.\n\nOn the following month the Secretary of the Navy addressed Congress upon the subject, and inclosed the letter and plans recommended by Captain Cassin, with his own approval. The result was that on March 27, 1804, a law was passed entitled, \"An act supplementary to the peace establishment act. \" One section of this supplementary act authorized the President to appoint a captain of the Navy in command of the yard and to perform the duties of naval agent; also to attach to the yard 1 second officer, 1 surgeon and 1 surgeon's mate, 1 sailing master, 1 head carpenter, 1 purser, 1 clerk of the yard, and 1 to keep account of stores; 2 boatswains, 2 gunners, 1 sail-maker and crew, 1 block-maker and crew, 100 seamen, and 3 marines.\n\nIt discontinued and dismissed from the service in the yard 9 boatswains, 9 gunners, 11 carpenters, 30 seamen, and 8 marines.\n\nUpon the passage of this law the Secretary of the Navy appointed Captain Tingey to the command of the navy-yard, and Captain Cassin, who at this period held the rank of Master Commandant, as second in command.\n\nIn the mean while, although as early as January, 1802, the Secretary of the Navy had officially announced that the President had determined that all vessels belonging to the United States, laid up in ordinary at other points, shall be brought to this navy-yard, and all vessels now in service shall return to this place and be fitted up here, yet for lack of appropriation by Congress, with the exception of two ware-houses which were built by order of the Secretary under the supervision of Captain Tingey, all work upon buildings, docks, wharfs, etc., was suspended during the years 1802 and 1803. In the summer of 1803 the small-pox appeared in virulent form among the crew of the Constellation, and by order of the Secretary of the Navy the frigate General Greene was fitted up for hospital and hauled out in the river and placed under the charge of Dr. Bullus, the surgeon attached to the navy-yard.\n\nThe records also inform us that in November of this year, by order of President Jefferson, we suppose as a practical exemplification of his method of securing peace, one hundred gun-carriages of the largest size\n\n--28--\n\nwere shipped on the schooner Citizen, chartered for the purpose, to \"his serene Highness\" the Emperor of Morocco. In the new era of peace and fraternity about to be inaugurated war ships would be useless, therefore these gun-carriages were taken from our frigates lying in ordinary and rotting in the Eastern Branch.\n\nEarly in the year 1805, shortly after assuming the command of the yard under the provision of Congress, Captain Tingey addressed the Secretary of the Navy, inclosing the views of Captain Cassin and of himself in regard to the government of the yard and the respective duties of the Commandant and those of the subordinate officers.\n\nThe following rules for the internal government of the navy-yard were finally approved by the Secretary of the Navy and adopted:\n\nThe Commandant shall be the only channel of communication between the head of the Navy Department and the officers of the yard, or of the ships in ordinary, or of the detail of any matter pertaining to the operations of either.\n\nNo officer of the yard or ships shall be permitted to engage or employ any extra seaman, mechanic, or laborer without first representing the necessity thereof, and stating the wages and terms on which such person is to be engaged, to the commandant for his approbation; nor shall any officer purchase any material whatever for the use of the yard without his approval.\n\nIt shall be the duty of the second officer in command to give regular information to the commandant of the completion of any work assigned to the different departments in the yard, advise him of what appears to be most necessary for their next operation, respectively, and receive his orders in writing and see them carried out.\n\nIn like manner it shall be the duty of the naval constructor, when any particular work under his immediate superintendence is completed, to notify the commandant and advise him, and take his directions in regard to further work in writing.\n\nThe officers and heads of the different mechanics, tradesmen, etc., attached to the yard shall make weekly reports of the number of hands respectively employed under them and of the work done within the week, to the officer second in command, who shall examine the same, and if he find the work done inadequate to the expense he shall report the same to the commandant, in order to a reduction of the force employed or to a total suspension thereof if deemed necessary.\n\nAll officers and persons attached to the yard who shall require leave of absence exceeding one whole day, shall make application for the same to the commandant and receive his assent.\n\nA communication to the House of Representatives from the Secretary of the Navy informs us that at the close of the year 1803 the Marine Barracks were included in the command of the Washington Navy-yard.\n\nThere were at this period 1 lieutenant-colonel commandant, 1 captain, 8 first lieutenants, 3 second lieutenants, 15 sergeants, 11 corporals, 16 musicians, and 146 privates on duty there. Agreeably to the law of 3d of March, 1801, the Marine Barracks supplied guards for the ships in ordinary as well as for the navy-yard.\n\nThe ships lying in ordinary at the close of the year 1804 were as follows: 44-gun ships (frigates), United States, Constitution, President, Chesapeake. 36-gun ships, Congress, Constellation, New York. 32-gun ship, Essex. 24-gun-ships, Boston, Adams.\n\n--29--\n\nFrom the year 1804, when by provision of Congress he was appointed commandant of the navy-yard, Captain Tingey was in continual communication with the Navy Department, and scarcely a week elapsed that he did not address the Department once or more, giving information concerning the navy-yard to the minutest detail, sending in requisitions for material and supplies needed, and lists of supplies, etc., sent to ships or navy agents abroad.\n\nThis correspondence at no time was delegated to Captain Cassin or to clerks. It is all in his own writing and style. To-day he sends a piece of port-fire to Commander Rodgers, finishes a cable for a frigate, settles a strike on the part of ship carpenters, smiths, riggers, and joiners of the yard; makes requisition for plank needed for the repair of a ship. Tomorrow he sends by a schooner munitions of war to Commodore Preble, at Boston, or to the gun-boats at New Orleans. The work of the various departments of the yard is at the same time under his management and supervision. In short, these letters, with now and then a hiatus, constitute a very fair diary of the transactions and events of the yard. They are, moreover, in the absence of the records and other sources of information that were burned at the capture of Washington, nearly all that are left us of reliable material for a history of the Washington navy-yard. Therefore, though searching for relevant matter through hundreds of books of manuscript without reliable indices involved much patient labor, we trust that the results will prove to have been compensatory.\n\nEarly in the year 1805 we find the architect, Mr. Latrobe, actively engaged at the yard in directing the work of the principal gate and the large timber shed according to the plan given in previous chapter.\n\nAll the material for building purposes for ships, all stores, etc., were furnished upon requisition of the commandant and the approval of the Secretary of the Navy. They were collected from any quarter; sometimes furnished by the Navy agents at Baltimore and Philadelphia, and frequently by individual contract or by direct purchase from citizens of Washington.\n\nSupplies were frequently sent from this yard to the Mediterranean Squadron, then consisting of a few ships, which we were compelled at this period, to maintain in that sea for the protection of our commerce against the freebooters and pirates of the Barbary States.\n\nThe records inform us that on May 11, 1805, the ship Huntress took on board from the navy-yard a large quantity of powder designed for the Mediterranean Squadron. The President on this day was on a visit to the yard to witness the trial work of a new engine purchased for the use of the yard. He went on board the Huntress and advised that the ship should not touch at Gibraltar as it was in a state of blockade, but proceed directly to Malta.\n\nWe are informed also that the President expressed a strong desire that the brig Wasp, then building at the yard, be pushed to completion\n\n--30--\n\nwith the greatest possible dispatch. The ship Huntress sailed on the 15th of May, but was destined never to reach the port for which she set sail. She was captured by a Spanish privateer when only three days out from Alexandria.\n\nThe navy-yard at this time, as we have said, began largely to supply ammunition and armament as needed by our ships in commission. On July 22, 1805, we learn that the schooner Harriet sailed from the yard with sixteen 9-pounders, and other materials calculated for that caliber, designed to arm and equip the Hornet, then lying at Norfolk. Captain Chauncey, who was in command of the Hornet, strongly objected to these guns as of insufficient caliber, and made complaint to this effect to the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary having referred the complaint to the commandant of the navy-yard, he replied as follows:\n\nI have strong confidence that said guns will be found adequate for the purposes of the intended cruise of the Hornet.\n\nThis does not seem to be a reply that would likely satisfy the commander of the Hornet, but as there was not at this time any regulation, or court of appeal, to settle such points of difference, it is probable that Captain Chauncey was compelled to accept the armament provided for the ship by the authorities of the navy-yard.\n\nThe frigate Adams was ordered to be repaired and fully equipped for service 29th of June, 1805. In response to this order, the commandant assured the Secretary of the Navy that, to accomplish this work, \"every exertion of the yard shall be instantly made. \" The commandant seemed eager to get at work once more, in the effort to repair our decaying ships. On the 6th of August he reported to the Secretary that the frigate had been completely and staunchly refitted, and had cleared the Eastern Branch for Alexandria, where she will receive the quarter-deck guns. \"Every department of the yard,\" adds the commandant, \"has used extreme exertion in accomplishing this work, and I am particularly obliged by the unremitting vigilance of Captain Cassin, second officer, and Mr. Lovell, master of the yard. The Adams, however, is in a bad state for want of officers. She has not yet one officer fit to trust her with, even at anchor in the river. \" Captain Murray, appointed to the command of the Adams, also wrote from Alexandria to the Department in the same strain. \"Can I not,\" he inquired, \"get quit of a dozen or more of the midshipmen, of whom we have eighteen on board, but one of whom has ever been to sea!\" In the early part of the fall of this year the commandant applied for a short respite from his official labors. The following, as a specimen of old-time style, we think will be of interest to our readers:\n\nNAVY YARD, Washington, 12th August 1805\n\nSIR: The business of the Frigate Adams having been fully accomplished here, I have to request your assent to my absence on my private business in Jersey, which has suffered something for want of personal attention. I conceive that my presence\n\n--31--\n\nat this yard may be as well dispensed with, at this juncture as at any time for the remainder of this year, and the time for my business will very little exceed three weeks, certainly within four.\n\nI have the honor to be Very respectfully sir Your obed't. servt.\n\nTHOS. TINGEY.\n\nHon'ble. Rt. SMITH\n\nOn his return from leave, during the greater part of December the commandant was disabled by sickness to a degree that he was compelled to transfer his duties to Captain Cassin, excepting his official correspondence, to which, sick or well, he tenaciously clung to the last.\n\nIn December, 1805, upon the recommendation of Mr. Jefferson, Congress appropriated $250,000 to build gun-boats, not exceeding fifty, \"for better protection of harbors, coast, and commerce of the United States. \" Mr. Jefferson's \"pet idea,\" as it was critically termed by his opponents, and which Congress adopted, was, that in place of a Navy there should be a system of gun-boat defense for harbors and coasts. The gun-boats were to be kept housed up in sheds or \"dry-docks\" in time of peace, and in war were to be manned and officered by the seamen or militia who were ready to volunteer for the purpose belonging to the town or locality attacked. No fortifications were required for harbors, as these were also to be protected by a sort of flying artillery carried about from place to place as needed.\n\nIn a message of President Jefferson to the House of Representatives, dated February 18, 1806, we find that at this date three gun-boats had been built at Washington Navy-Yard, Nos. 1, 4, and 10, at a cost from $10,000 to $15,000 each.\n\nBut the old Navy still continued to have some fast friends in Congress, and in the latter part of the year 1805 Congress appropriated a sum of money not to exceed $660,000 to build six line-of-battle ships.\n\nThe wages paid at Washington Navy-Yard in June, 1806, were as follows:\n\nOccupation. Number Amount\n\n(per day). Occupation. Number Amount\n\n(per day). Ship-carpenters (first rate) 41 $2.00 Caulkers 11 $1.75 Ship-carpenters (second rate) 8 1.75 Riggers 5 1.50 Apprentices (*) 1.25 Blacksmiths (*) 1.70 Laborers 70 .75 Coopers (*) 1.25 Ship and house joiners 19 1.50 Painters (*) 1.25\n\n* Number not given.\n\n--32--\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nIncrease of the force of the yard--Improvements--Incidents--School for midshipmen--Refitting the Chesapeake--Officers not pleased with the rigging-gear--Torpedo invention of Robert Fulton--House for commandant commenced--Expenses of the navy-yard--Perquisites of naval officers.\n\nAn official report from Captain Cassin gives an increase of the force in the navy-yard during the year 1805-6 of 108. It states that \"this increase was in consequence of the great increase of work and to meet the common emergencies of the navy-yard.\"\n\nJanuary 13, 1806, there were in ordinary at the Washington yard the frigates United States, President, Chesapeake, New York, Constellation, John Adams, Adams, Congress, and Boston, also the brig Hornet.\n\nOf these the frigates United States, Chesapeake, Constellation, President, and New York were ordered to be repaired and equipped for sea, and during this year the brig Wasp was nearly finished and prepared for equipment.\n\nThe greater portion of the work required to fit up the Chesapeake for service was done this year. So that early in the year 1807 the Wasp and the Chesapeake were both ready for sea.\n\nThe Wasp, commanded by Captain Jones, it will be remembered, captured the Frolic, a vessel of equal armament, in the war of 1812.\n\nIn the early part of May, 1806, the Chesapeake was fully prepared and equipped for sea, but did not go into immediate service for reasons hereafter given.\n\nMuch material was purchased for the other ships that had been selected to be fitted up for service. The work was continued also this year upon the gate of the yard. Guns, ammunition, and supplies of various kind were continually being shipped from this yard north and south. The yard at this time, and for several successive years, seemed to be used as the central depot of supply, and responded heartily and cheerily to every requisition for men, material, and supplies, whether it came from a frigate at Boston or at Norfolk, or a gun-boat at New Orleans.\n\nMr. Josiah Fox was attached to the yard as naval constructor at this date.\n\nWe learn from an official report from the commandant of the yard that the expenditure of money for timber, spars, etc., for the repairs of the ships from January 1, 1805, to February 28, 1806, amounted to $46,788.931/2.\n\n--33--\n\nThis material was purchased from about fifty individuals whose names are given with the amount purchased. Of these Littleton D. Teacle supplied material to the amount of $21,061.41.\n\nMost of this lumber was offered in response to a bill of advertisement from the commandant at fixed prices; frequently, however, individuals, without notice from the yard, brought various material which was purchased, if wanted, and was reported by the naval constructor to be of good quality.\n\nDuring the summer of 1806, under instructions from the Secretary of the Navy, material was purchased and put in preparation for extensive repairs of the frigates President and New York to be made the ensuing year to the amount of $27,469.24.\n\nIn August, 1806, a large amount of gunpowder was brought home by ships returning from the Mediterranean. The magazine of the War Department at Anacostia Point being full, with the approval of the mayor of the city, 100 barrels of this powder were lodged at Alexandria, the city to charge 25 cents per barrel for first month and 6 cents per barrel for each successive month.\n\nIn the latter part of 1806, the frigate Essex and the brigs Syren and Nixen were ordered to be repaired. A large quantity of salt, provisions, bread, and other stores landed from the brigs were condemned by survey and sold. The new shed was completed during the summer of this year.\n\nThe commandant of the navy-yard, although ever ready to use his influence to secure to the officers of his command favor or privilege, was not disposed to brook the slightest interference with his authority or the least neglect of regulation observance on the part of his subordinates. The naval constructor, Mr. Josiah Fox, in the fall of 1806, applied directly to the Secretary of the Navy for a furlough of eight days. The Secretary returned the letter to Captain Tingey, the commandant of the yard, approving of the request of Mr. Fox, providing, \"in the opinion of the commandant, there will be no inconvenience to the public interests resulting therefrom.\"\n\nThe frigate United States was then lying at the yard, and it had been determined upon recommendation of her commander, Captain James Barron, that the foremast of said ship should be moved aft 5 feet, but the Secretary, had given no special instructions as to the time of commencing the work. Captain Tingey, apparently in view of this contemplated work to be done, addressed the Secretary upon the subject of Mr. Fox's application for leave as follows:\n\nAlthough I consider that, in obedience to the regulations, the application of Mr. Fox for leave should have been through me, I shall have no objection. I conceive it, however, desirable that we have your instructions relative to moving the place of the foremast of the frigate United States before the furlough of Mr. Fox shall commence.\n\nIt does not appear when this detaining business was completed and when Mr. Fox got his leave, but shortly afterward we find him actively engaged in the yard in the preparation of a new scheme for the regulation\n\n--34--\n\nof apprentices in the yard, including their number and rate of pay, which was approved and adopted.\n\nIn the year 1807 a number of midshipmen were attached to the yard and to the ships in ordinary. Rev. Robert Thompson, a chaplain in the Navy, was ordered to the navy-yard on the special duty of instructing the young gentlemen of the Navy in mathematics and the theory of navigation. Chaplain Thompson having complained to the Secretary of the Navy that he had been removed from the accommodation provided for him on board the U.S.S. Congress, the Secretary immediately addressed the commandant, stating the complaint and asking, \"whence has this arisen?\" Captain Tingey, in his reply informed the Secretary that the matter occurred during his absence on leave. He had therefore directed Captain Cassin, who was in command during his absence, to inform him of the particulars of the case, and had received Captain Cassin's reply, which he respectfully inclosed.\n\n[Reply of Captain Cassin. ]\n\nNAVY-YARD, Washington, March 10, 1807.\n\nSIR: I had the honor of your letter of this morning, the contents of which shall be duly attended to. Lieutenant Tarbell while living on board the Congress was applied to by Chaplain Thompson to board with him, which was consented to, without any order to that effect. Afterwards Lieutenant Haraden joined the ordinary by express orders, and presuming my authority of sufficient magnitude, I directed him to live on board the Congress, the cabin of which would be for his accommodation, at the same time expressed my wish for Mr. Thompson to be accommodated. But without any other cause assigned whatever, he left the ship, swearing he would have the Congress and no other ship for his purpose.\n\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n\nJOHN CASSIN.\n\nCapt. THOMAS TINGEY,\n\nCommandant.\n\nIt is perhaps proper for us to explain, for the information of any civilian who may read this letter, that it is not at all probable that Chaplain Thompson uttered any profanity on this trying occasion, or that Captain Cassin meant to insinuate that he did. Among old sailors in those days any positive or strong avowal was termed \"swearing.\" Captain Cassin, like many other of our best officers in olden times, was much more at home in handling a ship than in writing elegant or even lucid English.\n\nBut for once at least, and for a wonder, the chaplain seems to have found a stout defender of his claim in the Secretary, who, after receiving the above statement, thus writes to the commandant:\n\nI cannot consent that the object for which Mr. Thompson was stationed here shall be thus defeated. Adequate and comfortable accommodations must be provided for him on board one of the ships in ordinary immediately, and I charge you with the execution of the order.\n\nIn the previous chapter it has been mentioned that the Chesapeake was preparing for sea early in May, 1806. Towards the latter part of this month, by order of the Department, the equipment was discontinued and the ship again dismantled. But on the 24th of January, 1807,\n\n--35--\n\norders were again received to prepare the ship for sea. A month later, when the ship was nearly completed for service, the commandant of the yard learned to his surprise that the principal officers attached to the Chesapeake had objected to her lower rigging, and directed that alterations be made in her spars, etc. Thereupon the commandant officially requested that permanent regulations be established determining how far the navy-yard is to proceed in fitting or refitting the materials of any ship in future ordered to the yard for equipment prior to the personal presence of the officers ordered to her. \"For,\" continues he, \"if we are to be subjected to alterations of finished work when a ship is nearly ready for sea, our labor becomes nugatory and our most strenuous efforts for system will be entirely paralyzed.\"\n\nThe records do not show that the Department at this time adopted any regulations upon this subject, but it is evident in this case, and also in others of similar nature, as will appear hereafter, that authoritative regulations upon this subject were needed.\n\nThe following is mentioned in the records as a portion of the work of the yard during the year 1807:\n\nThe frigate Essex taken from ordinary and work of repair commenced. Lower masts making for four of the largest class frigates. Building a rigging loft and shelter for boats. Two cables for the Chesapeake. Brigs Argus, Syren, and Nixen repaired.\n\nThirty thousand pounds of junk were issued to a number of poor persons in the city to be picked to supply the expenditure of oakum.\n\nWork upon the Wasp was also being prosecuted to completion this year, and the frigate United States received some repairs.\n\nThe canvas at the navy-yard being represented as deficient in strength, the commandant ordered a board of officers to inspect it. The board, with most commendable frankness and brevity, report as follows:\n\nThe American canvas is unfit for navy purposes!\n\nCaptain Cassin in the summer of this year having been ordered to plant buoys in the Eastern Branch, to designate the channel, reported that he had planted thirteen and that there were twenty feet of water on the shoal of the bar.\n\nIn December of this year, Robert Fulton, of steam-boat fame, appeared at the yard with authority from the Secretary of the Navy to test by experiment the value of a submarine torpedo invention, by which Mr. Fulton proposed to defend our harbors, etc. In the absence of any appropriation this distinguished inventor failed to receive that encouragement and support that was necessary. If Mr. Fulton had been properly encouraged and supported at this time, a system of torpedo attack and defense would probably have been discovered and created that would have produced wondrous results, and might have even changed the events of future history.\n\nAs will be seen hereafter, Mr. Fulton, notwithstanding the lack of encouragement which he received at this time, appeared again, after the capture of Washington by the British, at the navy-yard to urge the adoption of these new and powerful weapons of warfare.\n\n--36--\n\nUp to 1807 the house for the commandant included in the original plan of the architect, Latrobe, had not been built. But early in the year the commandant addressed the Secretary of the Navy upon the subject as follows:\n\nAs we now have as many material buildings as are at present applicable to our purpose, I respectfully suggest the propriety of building a house within the yard for the commandant. If Mr. Latrobe be directed to furnish the plan of this house immediately, it may be commenced in time to complete it in the course of the ensuing summer.\n\nThe records do not indicate the exact period when this building was completed and occupied by the commandant, but the work was doubtless commenced this year on the grounds adjacent to the gate, according to the original plan of the architect, Latrobe.\n\nEarly in the year 1808, by order of the Secretary of the Navy, a reduction in wages of the employés of the yard was made to the amount of 121/2 per cent., which was supposed would save $1,540.24 per month.\n\nThe roll of officers and men of the United States frigates in ordinary, reported by the commanding officer, Captain Cassin, on the 25th of April, 1808, was as follows:\n\nJohn Cassin, captain commanding; Nathan Haradan, lieutenant; James P. Potts, George Hodges, boatswains; Samuel Keeleg, Salvador Catalano, gunners; James Ord, carpenter; David Cretmyer, master-at-arms; Thos. Johnson, steward; 14 seamen, 24 ordinary seamen; total, 57.\n\nWorkmen under direction of Josiah Fox, Naval Constructor, from official report dated\n\nApril 25, 1808.\n\nThe expense per day, of the Naval Constructor's Department is reported as follows:\n\n--37--\n\nMr. Fox, in a letter accompanying this financial report, expresses himself as strongly opposed to the discharge of any one of the present employés, unless it be the carver, whom he thinks he can spare, to lessen expenses!\n\nHe calls attention to the fact that our costliest and finest frigates lying in ordinary are slowly perishing for want of repair and are daily getting worse. He thinks it bad policy and false economy to reduce the number of workmen at this time, unless it be a necessity for lack of appropriation, etc.\n\nOn the 27th of March, 1808, Congress enacted a law in relation to the emoluments to which officers attached to navy-yards and other stations were entitled.\n\nThis law seemed in some respects to be lacking in clearness. Among other points it left in doubt whether light and fuel were included in the perquisites allowed to officers attached to Washington navy-yard. Captain Cassin, having given a practical interpretation of this law by actually appropriating the articles above named to his own private use, charges were preferred against him for using Government fuel and candles.\n\nBut we are glad to learn that a court of inquiry decided that by a fair interpretation of the act aforesaid officers were entitled to these perquisites.\n\nThe commandant of the yard, however, was less successful in his effort to secure to himself and the other officers of the yard the emolument of private servants at the expense of the Government.\n\nIn a letter to the Secretary of the Navy he \"asks the indulgence of keeping on the pay-roll certain persons, servants to different officers of this yard. \" Informs the Secretary that it has been a customary \"indulgence\" common to every officer in the military and marine service and generally in number according to rank, and adds that \"he and all the officers attached to the yard hope that the Secretary will be pleased to take the matter into consideration and sanction to them the 'indulgence' common to all their brother officers and also designate the rank of the officers here to be allowed servants and the quantum to each.\"\n\nTo this request the Secretary of the Navy responds:\n\nThe commandant of the navy-yard is in error as to its being an established custom for Navy officers on shore to place their private servants upon the pay-rolls, retain them in their respective families, and draw for these servants the same pay and rations as are allowed to the men working in the public service in ordinary. It has been the custom for officers appointed to ships to carry on board with them their servants, who are placed on the roll, the officers drawing their pay and rations, but a servant on board ship is at all times liable to be called into action, and the commanding officer can at any time assign to such servants such duties as in his opinion the public good require. On shore they can not at all times be called into service. The commanding officer can not assign them on any emergency to the performance of any especial duty. Thus the cases do not appear parallel, and the custom on board ship can not apply on shore. There is, therefore, no custom but one of recent origin in the navy-yard here.\n\n--38--\n\nThe question here arises, ought such a custom now to he established? No. Because it can not be a useful one. To the Army a commissioned officer is entitled to draw one ration per day only, this without pay for a servant belonging to him. In the Marine Corps, the same.\n\nIf in the Army and the Marine Corps an officer takes a servant from the line, the servant, not the officer, draws his pay and rations.\n\nThus, then, the \"indulgence,\" for there is no other name by which it can be called, is sanctioned neither by the usage of the Army, Navy, nor Marine Corps.\n\nAn officer in the Army or Marine Corps can draw no pay for servant belonging to him. The officers of the yard here ask pay for their servants--a servant to an officer in the Army or Marine Corps if taken from the line draws his own pay and rations. If not taken from the line the master draws the ration only. Thus were the rule admitted it would become a source of emolument to the Navy officer, whereas the Army officer never can draw any emoluments from the same source.\n\nThis decision of the Secretary of the Navy was evidently a surprise and disappointment to Captain Tingey, but there was nothing left him but the inalienable and inestimable privilege of the sailor on land or sea, viz, of \"growling,\" in constrained tone. This the commandant does, in his letter of reply, in this obscure, old-fashioned style. After informing the Secretary that in obedience to instructions he had discharged the servants, to the number of eleven, employed in the yard, \"I can not dissemble,\" he continues, \"that I experience some unpleasant feelings at having asked an indulgence that can not be granted, especially as the officers of the yard would be well satisfied to be only on an equality, or even nearly approximating thereto, with those around us not immediately attached to the yard. \"\n\n--39--\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nState of gun-boats building at the yard--The arrangements for the armament of the frigate President--Complaint of Captain Bainbridge of an imperfect cable furnished by the yard and its results--Introduction of circular ship-lights--Complaint of Captain Decatur of the rigging of his ship, etc. --Pistols manufactured at the yard--Relics--Summary of work done at the yard in 1811-'12--Minor incidents and events--Scarcity of naval officers at Washington--The British threatening invasion--The commandant unable to secure force sufficient to place the navy-yard in a defensible condition.\n\nOn August 6, 1808, in reply to a request of President Jefferson for information as to the state of the gun-boats, ten in number, then building at Washington navy-yard, the naval constructor reported that Nos. 28, 70, 71, 74, 75, and 76 can be launched in twelve days; Nos. 72, 77, and 78 in fifteen days, and No. 73 would require six weeks in which to finish.\n\nThese gun-boats were built, it is said, upon a model recommended by Commodore Preble.\n\nGreat results were anticipated from these gun-boats as effective weapons of offensive and defensive warfare. These anticipations were never realized. Notwithstanding the ardent and personal patronage of Mr. Jefferson, they proved to be in the end a costly failure. The cost of the simple material used in the ten gun-boats built at Washington, together with the material shipped from the yard for the boats building at Wilmington and New Orleans, was reported to be $8,323.\n\nIn the summer of 1808, for the purpose of better governing the temporary absence of officers and employés from the yard during the day, the following leave-of-absence regulations were adopted:\n\nNo officer, mechanic, or laborer attached to the yard shall leave it during the hours of work without permission obtained from the executive officer of the yard, and in case the time of absence shall require more than one hour, he shall apply through the executive to the commandant, in writing, stating the quantum of time wanted and the general nature of the business to be transacted.\n\nEvery application shall be kept on file in the office of the commandant, and if found in his opinion too frequent on the part of any applicant, he shall forthwith report the same to the Department, whose sanction must be secured whenever leave of absence shall require more than one whole day.\n\nThe following descriptive detail of the arrangement for the armament of the frigate President, fitted out at Washington navy-yard in the years 1808 and 1809 upon the recommendation of Commodore Rodgers and Captains Bainbridge, Chauncey, and Tingey, who constituted a\n\n--40--\n\nboard appointed by the Secretary of the Navy for this purpose, will be interesting to naval officers:\n\nThe top of the plank shear and sills of the ports to be on a line 7 inches from the deck and 3 feet 6 inches high in the clear. To have nine ports of each side on the quarter-deck and four of a side in the forecastle. To be so placed that the guns may not be obstructed by the rigging. The taffrail rail to be cut down to a corresponding height with the quarter rail and to have the same sweep as the deck abaft. The bowsprit to be lowered 15 inches in the bed, and to have 5 feet less steeve than before. The stern-ports to be the same size as the quarter-deck ports. The knight heads and bulwarks forward to be cut down in a line with the bulwarks abaft, and the rail to be extended so as to admit stowing the hammocks across the bows.\n\nThe office of commandant of a navy-yard at all times is a very responsible and trying one, demanding knowledge, patience, and vigilance, as well as executive ability.\n\nThe records show many instances in which these qualities were signally displayed by Captain Tingey during his command of the yard. Though slow to acknowledge a mistake or error on his own part, and quick to defend himself against the slightest implication to this effect, he never shrank from any responsibility imposed by his office or attempted to escape therefrom by throwing it upon the shoulders of others.\n\nFor example, the records inform us that in the latter part of the year 1809 Captain Bainbridge, then in command of the frigate President, sent an official complaint to the Secretary of the Navy, in which he states that on account of \"the extreme insufficiency\" of a new cable furnished by the navy-yard his ship had been endangered. Upon receipt of this information Captain Tingey ordered a strict survey of some pieces of the defective cable that had been forwarded from the frigate President. The officers on the survey reported that said cable had been manufactured of weak yarn made of bad hemp, badly cleaned, and generally devoid of strength, etc.\n\nThis cable had been furnished, or was supposed to have been furnished, by Richard Parrot, a rope-maker of Georgetown.\n\nTherefore upon the report of the survey Captain Tingey addressed said Parrot, demanding--\n\nFirst. That he should immediately furnish proof to the Navy Department that the yarns of which said cable was composed was made of good sound hemp, hackled and cleaned, in the usual and regular way.\n\nSecond. That these yarns received no damage after spinning to the time of being laid up into the cable aforesaid.\n\nThird. That there were the usual number of yarns to the strand for a rope of that magnitude, properly tarred.\n\nFourth. That in laying said cable the usual weight of drag was used, and was laid by a competent workman in the usual and proper manner.\n\nThis letter is indorsed by Paul Hamilton, Secretary of the Navy, as follows:\n\n\"Satisfactory information is deemed indispensable. \"\n\n--41--\n\nWithout going into further detail, it is enough to inform our readers that Mr. Parrot came off with flying colors, first, by giving satisfactory proof that the defective rope was not of his manufacture; second, by finding the rope which he had manufactured for the President still new, unused, and perfect, on board the store-ship General Greene.\n\nThe commandant of the yard, as it appears to us, on this trying occasion, might have avoided responsibility by throwing it from his own shoulders upon those of his subordinate officers, or upon Captain Bainbridge himself. For the executive officer, Lieutenant Haraden, reported that the defective cable \"was inspected in the yard, looked fair, and was received by Captain Bainbridge after a personal examination. \" But without the least attempt to shirk responsibility Captain Tingey replies to a letter of complaint upon the subject from C. W. Goldsborough, Acting Secretary of the Navy, as follows:\n\nSuch has been the hasty and extreme importunity we have experienced from the officers lately fitting out at this yard, from their laudable zeal for every possible and practicable dispatch, that it will not be surprising to me if many more extraordinary mistakes or errors shall appear besides the one alluded to in your letter.\n\nIn the summer of 1809 a few specimen circular skylights of solid glass, manufactured at Boston, were introduced at the navy-yard for the first time. All that were on hand, to the number of six, were immediately appropriated by Captain Decatur for his ship, the United States, to the great disappointment of the officers in command of the other ships in commission. The Secretary of the Navy however approved the invention, and ordered that all our ships should be supplied with these new lights.\n\nBut though successful in securing the new skylights, Captain Decatur was not satisfied with his ship in all respects, and we find in the records an official document addressed to the Secretary of the Navy, in which Captain Decatur finds fault with the lower rigging of his ship. This complaint being referred to the commandant of the navy-yard, Captain Tingey, in his reply, expresses his sorrow \"that the Secretary should be troubled by such unpleasant representations, but that he could suggest no remedy until a systematic scale is adopted for all the spars, rigging, and equipment of the ships, according to rate and size, from which no officer shall deviate. Officers are now guided each by his own opinion, and my opinion is that the lower rigging of the United States is made sufficiently large, though I have no desire that my judgment shall be binding on other officers against their own. \" With this letter he inclosed to the Secretary a letter from Commodore Rodgers on the same subject, in which Commodore Rodgers writes as follows:\n\nI shall never think that there is even a probability of the Navy becoming respectable until there is an attempt made to reduce to system our dock-yards and everything connected with the equipment of our ships. At present every three ships costs the Government as much as four could do if the proper system was once established, obliging the commander of every ship to abide by it without deviation.\n\n--42--\n\nThere are scarcely two of us at present who entertains the same opinion as to the masting or sparring of a ship, the quantity of stores she ought to have, the kind of armament most suited to her rate, nor in fact of anything else from truck to a cap from jolly-boat to the ship herself. This, however, is not owing to our ignorance in such matters, but the natural result of being left too much to our own wills.\n\nIn January, 1809, in the absence of the Secretary of the Navy, Hon. S. R. Bradley, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, addressed Captain Tingey, inquiring as to the condition of the frigates in ordinary at the navy-yard, and the expense and time that would be required to prepare them for active service.\n\nCaptain Tingey, in his letter of reply, states that--\n\nThe United States, the Essex, and John Adams are in as good order in their hulls as on the day they were launched, and can be rigged in a few weeks.\n\nThe frigates Congress and Adams might also proceed to a station at the mouth of any of our bays and harbors, but their hulls are not in condition to bear the sea in heavy weather.The frigates Constitution and New York are unfit to proceed from this yard until they have had thorough repairs.\n\nThe President is now progressing under a thorough repair and may be ready for sea in May next, if our force is not reduced.\n\nUpon the receipt of this report, Congress ordered that this last named ship, together with the John Adams and Essex, be immediately equipped for sea and that this work should be done with all possible dispatch. The commandant of the yard was authorized to employ an additional force of 28 carpenters, 20 joiners, 16 sail-makers, 12 riggers, 8 coopers, 4 painters, 4 boat builders, 4 blacksmiths, and 1 tinman.\n\nThese ships, in addition to the usual armament, upon the recommendation of Captain Tingey and other naval officers, were supplied each with a small number of rifles, purchased from Baltimore. The pistols with which these frigates were supplied were manufactured at the navy-yard. Indeed, at different periods in the history of this navy-yard up to its disastrous destruction by fire in 1814, there were, experimental efforts made to manufacture within the yard, not only armament, but every piece of nautical mechanism required by a man of war.\n\nWm. Small is mentioned as a manufacturer of mathematical instruments, but seems not to have been successful in his work, as the records mention his dismissal in September, 1809. The naval constructor, Josiah Fox, also retired from duty at the yard this year; this man seems to have been a conscientious and competent officer, but was dismissed upon the recommendation of the commandant on the 4th of May, 1809, after a service of five years, on the ground that there was no longer any occasion for his services as naval constructor. He and the commandant seem not at all times, or, indeed, at any time, to have been in hearty accord with each other.\n\nIn reply to a letter of inquiry from the Secretary of the Navy, dated October 13, 1809, as to the history of two pieces of brass cannon found at the navy-yard, upon one of which was engraved the word \"Garzon. \"\n\n--43--\n\nand upon the other \"Generoso,\" we find the following response from the commandant, Captain Tingey:\n\nWASHINGTON NAVY-YARD, 13th October, 1809.\n\nSIR: Since receipt of your letter of 10th instant, expressing a desire to ascertain from what source two brass 6-pounder cannon came into our possession, I have endeavored to obtain positive information thereon from the officers of the yard, but without such effect as to leave the fact entirely clear of doubt.\n\nThe cannon are of Spanish royal manufacture, bearing the arms, etc., of Charles IV, and it is believed were brought to the yard by the brig Franklin when she arrived first from the Mediterranean, hence it is highly probable that they are the two pieces taken at Derne.\n\nTHOMAS TINGEY.\n\nCHARLES W. GOLDSBOROUGH, Esq.\n\n(For the Secretary of the Navy.)\n\nThe Tripolitan city of Derne was captured early in the year 1805 by a few hundred men led by an adventurous American ex-consul or agent named William Eaton, assisted by our Navy under the command of Captain Hull.\n\nThe records for the year 1810 show no diminution of activity in the various departments of the yard. Fewer ships were under repair but there was considerable internal improvement.\n\nA new saw-mill and a block mill, with very expensive machinery, were erected and a manufactory of barrels established. The sail loft was new roofed; a new steam-engine built and put in effective working order, and considerable repair and improvement made in the buildings of the yard. There was also the usual exportation of supplies from the yard to Norfolk, New Orleans, and other points. One shipment to the squadron at New Orleans is thus mentioned:\n\nShipped from this navy-yard to the squadron on station at New Orleans, stores, comprising master's, carpenter's, boatswain's, sail-maker's and gunners' stores for one year. Shipped March 18, 1810, on the good ship William Yeaton, Richard Hepburn, master for the present voyage. Estimated value, $17,000.\n\nThe following is a condensed summary of the work accomplished in Washington navy-yard in the years 1811 and 1812, taken from official manuscript documents in the Bureau of Yards and Docks:\n\nSUMMARY OF THE WORK IN WASHINGTON NAVY-YARD IN THE YEARS 1811 AND 1812.\n\nBrig Vixen. The brig Vixen having been hauled up in wharf in the fall of the preceding year on the 4th of January, 1811, her bottom was completely coppered from the keel up, and on the 5th she was launched. Then, several new knees were fitted to her gun-deck beams. Her upperworks were made entirely new, and her gun-deck and all the store rooms, cabin, ward-room, etc., completed. The whole of her rigging was refitted, being replaced by a new set. Her spars and sails were repaired and some of each made new. She was furnished with new cables and painted throughout. Being completely fitted for sea, with her equipment of ammunition and stores, she sailed from the yard on the 30th of May.\n\nBrig Hornet. The brig Hornet was hauled up on the 10th of January, 1811. Her upperworks, futtocks, beams, breasthooks, and main transom and most of her floor timbers being rotten, she was completely rebuilt, with new compartments within and\n\n--44--\n\njoiners' work throughout. She was also new coppered and launched on the 11th of May, same year.\n\nA ship, not named in official report, was rigged with an entire new set of masts, spars, rigging, and cable. Her sails, cabin furniture, and nearly her whole equipment of ammunition, stores, etc., were supplied from the yard. She was ready for sea on the 20th of September, virtually and to all appearance a new ship.\n\nSchooner Enterprise. This schooner arrived at the yard for repairs on the 24th of February, 1811. After being unrigged and relieved of her armament and stores, new rigging and sails were refitted, her masts taken out, alterations made of her interior, her bends and upperworks repaired and calked. She was careened and her copper cleaned and repaired, was painted throughout, and furnished with new armament and ammunition and a general supply of provisions and stores. She sailed from the yard April 25th.\n\nShip Wasp. This ship arrived at the yard May 21, 1811. After being dismantled, her armament removed, and emptied of her stores and ballast, she was careened, keel cut on both sides, her bottom cleaned and copper repaired, rigging and sails repaired, painted throughout, equipped completely, and was ready for sea on the last week of July. We find the following addenda to the official report from which these notes are taken:\n\n[NOTE. The Wasp was built at this yard by the workmen on daily pay at the very same time that the Hornet was built by contract at Baltimore, and by the same draught. It has been authoritatively stated that the Hornet is so rotten as to necessitate complete rebuilding. On thorough examination of the Wasp previous to careening, only one unsound timber was found in her. ]\n\nFrigate Adams. In August, 1811, the Adams was fitted for a receiving-ship, her decks calked, quartered and deck-sheathed, and fitted up comfortably for her officers and men.\n\nSchooner Enterprise. October, 1811, this schooner arrived again at this yard. She was hauled up, cut down and stripped to her floor timbers, entirely rebuilt, coppered, launched, and rigged as a brig. Her hull was much improved and she was furnished with new sets of masts, spars, sails and rigging, and supply of stores. Her armament was changed from long light guns to carronades and two heavy Chase guns with new carriages and other apparatus thereto pertaining. She was equipped and sailed from the yard a complete, staunch vessel, in all respects as good as new.\n\nFrigate Congress. This ship in the preceding year was thoroughly repaired in the carpenters' work of her hull to an extent nearly equal to rebuilding. During the year 1811 the interior arrangements in joiners' work were entirely newly refitted. In October and November of this year the carpenters made alterations in her decks. She was masted and sparred, furnished with new sails and rigging, cable boats, water casks, gun carriages, etc. After being supplied with stores she left the yard a better ship than when first launched.\n\nFrigate Constellation. In February, 1812, this ship was brought up to wharf, stripped down to her lower futtocks, which, with her floor timber, were replaced with new and built up entirely new; she was much improved by an extension of 14 inches more beam at the main breadth; her hull was finished; she was masted and careened, new copper bolts driven through her bottom and riveted, three new metal rudder braces fixed to her stern-post, and a new rudder made; she was new coppered, her joiners' work fitted new and complete; was furnished with new water casks, gun-carriages, masts, spars, rigging, cables, sails, boats, and stores, and in the fall of the year left the yard a better ship than when first fresh from the stocks.\n\nGun-boat No. 59, remodeled and renamed. In March, 1812, this old gun-boat was hauled up and cut down to her floor timbers and rebuilt with much improvement; was coppered, launched, and rigged anew; was supplied with new sails and boats, new armaments, etc., and thus fitted out she was named Scorpion.\n\nFrigate Constitution. This ship reached the yard April, 1812; her armaments, etc.,\n\n--45--\n\nbeing removed, she was careened and newly coppered; received new foremast and bowsprit; many of her spars were altered; she was rigged, refitted, and her sails repaired or replaced by new; she was equipped for sea and sailed again in fine order.\n\nFrigate Adams. This frigate in June, 1812, was hauled up on the ways; was cut asunder at deadflat and lengthened 15 feet, and from thence was entirely rebuilt and new coppered; her masts were made anew; spars, sails, gun-carriages, etc., made and ready to go on board and nearly finished at the close of the year.\n\nGun-boats. Nine gun-boats which had been sometime in the stocks and in part built in the summer of 1812 wore finished aud launched; they were equipped with new masts, sails, etc., and armed each with one 18-pounder long gun mounted on pivot carriages, and two 32 pound carronades, and with bed and slide carriages, etc.\n\nBrig Nautilus. This brig came to the yard during this year, received some slight repairs, supplies, stores, etc., and sailed again.\n\nMiscellaneous mention. Besides these repairs to shipping in the years 1811-12, there was also much internal improvement made in the yard: in the steam-engine and sawmill departments, and in building additional stores to two of the warehouses; the masting sheers were repaired and erected again; a large scow fitted up for anchor hoy, to aid in transporting the shipping, weighing anchors, etc., and the usual exportation to other ports of provisions, armaments, etc.\n\nMINOR INCIDENTS AND EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE YARD IN THE YEARS 1811, 1812, AND 1813.\n\nThe records of the years above-named are full of minor incidents and events connected with the life of the yard, a few of which we will hastily relate:\n\nIn the year 1811 Lieut. J. Blakely was in command of the schooner Enterprise, which was then undergoing repair at the yard. The ship being ready for service her commander sent in a requisition for cabin furniture, upon which we find the following indorsement by the commandant of the yard:\n\nThis vessel was fitted out from this yard in 1808. She was at that lime furnished with silver tablespoons, teaspoons, and other usual plate, with chairs, tables, etc., including all the customary articles for the cabin, not one single material of which has been returned with her. I also consider it my duty to inform the Secretary that all the vessels equipped from this yard have been furnished with boatswains' calls of silver, very few of which have been returned.\n\nA DISTINGUISHED EMPLOYÉ OF THE YARD.\n\nIn the month of January, 1812, a Frenchman named Louis Rose appeared at the yard bearing a letter from Mr. Latrobe, in which said Rose was strongly recommended to be employed as overseer and director of the block mill. From a letter addressed to Captain Cassin, whom Rose had previously met in France, we learn that he (Rose) was a native of L'Orient; that he had constructed a block manufactory for \"the late king,\" Louis XVI, probably; also one at Brest on a much larger scale impelled by water. These machines, so the letter said, had given great satisfaction to lovers of mechanical art--French and foreign. The letter further stated that Mr. Rose had made frequent applications for permission to quit France, but without success until Bonaparte returned to France after being crowned King of Italy, when, with\n\n--46--\n\nreluctance, he was permitted to leave the country. The letter, in short, enumerated a long list of accomplishments, of which, if the bearer possessed one-half, he must have been found to be a great acquisition to the navy-yard.\n\nCaptain Cassin, who had long faithfully served as second officer, was detached from the yard in the year 1812 and ordered to the command of the navy-yard at Norfolk.\n\nPRICE OF \"GOOD\" WHISKY IN 1812.\n\nThe records inform us that on August 6, of this year, Mr. John Eliason, of Georgetown, sold to the yard for Navy use, 120 barrels of \" good whisky \" at 52 cents per gallon.\n\nThe naval department of the yard, therefore, seems to have been well supplied at home, but we learn that in the absence of any other provision, a practice had grown among the civilian mechanics and laborers of the yard to send out, daily, men or boys to bring in liquor for their use.\n\nThe commandant objected to this practice on the grounds that such errands necessitated the frequent breaking off from work on the part of those engaged, for an hour or more, thus resulting in the loss of time and labor owed to the Government. Thereupon the blacksmiths of the yard sent in a formal complaint to the Secretary of the Navy, \"that they are not allowed refreshments while engaged at heavy work.\"\n\nBut the commandant, with characteristic finesse, managed to hold firmly to his purpose and at the same time allow the desired \"refreshment,\" as will appear in the following additional order or permit which he issued:\n\nIf such an indulgence is necessary, the liquor may be brought into the yard at bell-ringing.\n\nTHE DUELLO.\n\nThe practice of duelling, which the modern time spirit has overthrown, at least in Great Britain and in our own country, still prevailed everywhere at the time of which we write. Among the records of this date, we find a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, indorsed by the commandant, from Midshipman G. Lynch, who was slowly recovering from a severe wound received in a duel. The letter is a request that full pay may be allowed him during his disability, and that he may be placed in such service as in his present state he may be able to perform. Neither the name of his opponent nor the cause of the quarrel are to be found in the records, but the commandant, in his letter of indorsement, says:\n\nI do not think that Midshipman Lynch was to blame in the affair.\n\nNAVY AGENT.\n\nOn November 13, 1813, Richard Parrot, esq., was appointed Navy agent for the Washington navy-yard, and it was ordered by the Secretary of the Navy \"that all requisitions of money or supplies for navy-\n\n--47--\n\nyard and vessels building or equipping or in ordinary will be made on him. All condemned articles and all surplus from vessels will be under his charge and will be disposed of by him under the direction of the Department.\"\n\nThis is at least the second official appointment of a civilian to the naval agency of the yard, and it would seem, in view of the laborious duties belonging to the office of commandant, that this responsible and vexatious additional duty would not at any time be imposed upon him, but for want of sufficient salary, or for other reasons not given in the records, it appears that Mr. Parrot soon resigned the naval agency and this additional laborious office again reverted to the commandant of the yard and continued to be imposed upon him until the close of his career.\n\nTHE UNLUCKY OFFICER.\n\nOn May 20, 1813, the Secretary of the Navy ordered a court of inquiry to be held at the Washington navy-yard in regard to the circumstances attending the surrender of the United States brig of war Viper, while under the command of Lieut. John D. Henle"
