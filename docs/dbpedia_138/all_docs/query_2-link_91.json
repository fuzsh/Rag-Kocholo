        "text": "A Your First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech and Association\n\nYour First Amendment Right to Freedom of Speech and Association\n\nThe Turner Rule: Under the First Amendment, a prison regulation that stops you from speaking, expressing yourself, or interacting with other people must be reasonably related to a legitimate government interest. The court will consider whether the regulation leaves open other ways for you to express yourself, how the regulation impacts other prisoners and prison resources, and whether there are easy alternatives to the regulation that would not restrict your rights as much.\n\nThe First Amendment protects everybody’s right to freedom of speech and association. Freedom of speech and association includes the right to read books and magazines, the right to call or write to your family and friends, the right to criticize the government or state officials, and much more. However, in prison those rights are restricted because of the prison’s need for security and administrative ease. Because of this, it is often very hard for a prisoner to win a First Amendment case.\n\nMost prison First Amendment issues are governed by a legal standard developed in a case called Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987). In Turner, prisoners in Missouri brought a class action lawsuit challenging a regulation that limited the ability of people in prison to marry or write letters to each other. The Supreme Court used the case to establish a four-part test for First Amendment claims. Under this test, a court decides whether prison policy or practice is constitutional by asking four questions:\n\nTHE TURNER TEST\n\nP QUESTION 1: Is the regulation reasonably related to a legitimate, neutral government interest? “Reasonably related” means that the rule is at least somewhat likely to do whatever it is intended to do. A rule banning a book on bomb-making is reasonably related to the prison’s goal of security. However, a rule banning all novels is not.\n\n“Neutral government interest” means that the prison’s goal must not be related to dislike of a particular idea or group. Increasing prison security is a neutral and legitimate goal. Encouraging prisoners to practice a certain religion, to stop criticizing the prison administration, or to wear their hair a certain way are not neutral or legitimate goals. The prison can’t pick and choose certain books or ideas or people unless it has a “neutral” reason, like security, for doing so.\n\nP QUESTION 2: Does the regulation leave open another way for you to exercise your constitutional rights? This means the prison can’t have a rule that keeps you from expressing yourself altogether. For example, prison officials can stop the media from conducting face-to-face interviews with people in prison as long as prisoners have other ways (like mail) to communicate with the media. Pell v. Procunier 417 U.S. 817 (1974).\n\nP QUESTION 3: How does the regulation impact other prisoners, prison guards or officials, and prison resources? This question allows the court to consider how much it would cost in terms of money and staff time to change the regulation or practice in question. For example, one court held that it is constitutional to prevent prisoners from calling anyone whose number is not on their list of ten permitted numbers because it would take prison staff a long time to do the necessary background checks on additional numbers. Pope v. Hightower, 101 F.3d 1382 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\nThis question is not always just about money. It also requires the court to take into consideration whether changing the regulation would pose a risk to other prisoners or staff or create a “ripple effect” causing other problems in the prison. Fraise v. Terhune, 283. F.3d 506, 520 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\nP QUESTION. 4: Are there obvious, easy alternatives to the regulation that would not restrict your right to free expression? This part of the test allows a person in prison to suggest an easy way for the prison to achieve their goal without restricting prisoners’ rights. Not every suggestion will work. For example, one court held that it is constitutional to ban letters between two people in two different facilities after one of the two sent a threatening letter to the other’s Superintendent. The court ruled that monitoring this type of correspondence is not an obvious or easy alternative to banning it. U.S. v. Felipe, 148 F.3d 101 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\nYou will want to keep these four questions in mind as you read the following sections on the First Amendment.\n\n1. Access to Reading Materials\n\nP The Basics Prison Officials can keep you from getting or reading books that they think are dangerous or pornographic. They can also make you get all books straight from the publisher.\n\nThe First Amendment protects your right to get reading material like books and magazines. This doesn’t mean that you can have any book you want. Your right is limited by the prison’s interest in maintaining order and security, and promoting rehabilitation. Until 1989, the Supreme Court required prisons to prove that banning material was necessary to meet government interests in prison order, security, and rehabilitation. This standard was from a case called Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974), and it gave people in prison fairly strong protection of their right to get books. However, since then the Supreme Court has become much more conservative and has given prisons greater power to restrict your First Amendment rights. Now a prison can keep you from having magazines and books as long as it meets the Turner test, explained above. This change happened in an important Supreme Court case called Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989). If you feel that your right to have reading materials is being violated, you should probably start your research by reading Thornburgh v. Abbott.\n\nWhy Read Cases?\n\nSometimes in this Handbook we suggest that you read court cases. While we have tried to summarize the law for you, the cases we suggest will give you much more detailed information and will help you figure out whether you have a good legal claim. Chapter Seven explains how to find cases in the law library based on their “citation.” You can also ask the library clerk for help finding a case. Chapter Seven gives helpful tips on how to get the most out of reading a case.\n\nFinally, Chapter Seven contains an explanation of the court systems and how cases are used as grounds for court decisions. Be sure to read it if you are going to do any legal research. Remember that federal courts in one state do not always follow decisions by federal courts in other states.\n\nWhile the Turner standard is less favorable to prisoners, it still provides some protection. Prison officials need to justify their policies in some way. If they can’t, the regulation may be struck down. Prisons can’t just ban books and magazines randomly.\n\nCourts also require prisons to follow fair procedures to ban a publication. A prison cannot maintain a list of excluded publications or decide that no materials from a particular organization will be allowed in. It must decide about each book or magazine on a case-by-case basis. This is true even if a prison official already knows that the book or magazine comes from an organization they don’t approve of. Williams v. Brimeyer, 116 F.3d 351 (8th Cir. 1997). Some type of notice from the prison is usually required as well. For example, some prisons require the warden to tell you when they reject a book or magazine sent to you, and to give the publisher or sender a copy of the rejection letter. Courts may require that the prison have a procedure so that you, or the publisher or sender, can appeal the decision.\n\nPrison officials cannot censor material just because it contains religious, philosophical, political, social, or unpopular content. They can only censor material if they believe it may cause disorder or violence, or hurt a prisoner’s rehabilitation. In Greybuffalo v. Kingston, 581 F. Supp. 2d 1034 (W.D. Wisc. 2007) for example, a man in the Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections was punished for having a quote about freedom from a Native American chief in his cell, with the initials A.I.M. “A.I.M.” stands for the “American Indian Movement,” which is a civil rights movement dating back to the 1960s. The court ruled that it was unreasonable to think the material created any threat to prison security and found that the prison had violated Greybuffalo’s First Amendment rights. However, cases like this are rare because the Turner standard gives prison wardens broad discretion. Most courts will believe a prison official who says that a book or magazine creates a threat to prison security. It is important to remember that sometimes decisions are inconsistent among different courts.\n\nCourts have allowed prisons to ban reading materials that advocate racial superiority and violence against people of another race or religion. Stefanow v. McFadden, 103 F.3d 1466 (9th Cir. 1996); Chriceol v. Phillips, 169 F.3d 313 (5th Cir. 1999). One court allowed special inspection of a prisoner’s mail after he received a book with a suspicious title, even though the book was just an economics textbook. Duamutef v. Holllins, 297 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2002). Another court decided that a prison could ban people from receiving the Physician’s Desk Reference in the mail because it contains information about drugs, even though the same book was available in the prison library. Munson v. Gaetz, 673 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 2012).\n\nPrison officials are normally allowed to ban an entire offending publication, as opposed to just removing the sections in question. Shabazz v. Parsons, 127 F. 3d 1246 (10th Cir. 1997). However, this is not always the case. In 2011, Louisiana prisons were not allowed to ban a Nation of Islam newspaper when objectionable pages could be deleted. Leonard v. Louisiana, 449 Fed. Appx. 386 (5th Cir. 2011).\n\nPrisons must also abide by the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection of the laws to all citizens. This means that, for example, a prison cannot ban access to materials targeted to an Black audience if they do not ban similar materials popular among white people. See Section C of this Chapter for more information on equal protection claims.\n\nLots of cases about access to reading material involve sexually explicit materials. Some courts have said that people in prison have a right to non-obscene, sexually explicit material that is commercially produced (as opposed to, for example, nude pictures of spouses or lovers). Other courts have allowed total bans on any publication portraying sexual activity or featuring frontal nudity. Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir. 1999). One court found that blurred or censored nude photos could be barred. Woods v. Director's Review Comm., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44805 (S.D. Tex. 2012). Bans on sexually explicit materials might go too far if they ban works of literature merely describing intercourse. In one case a court said a ban went too far when it removed works like Ulysses and Lady Chatterley’s Lover from a prison library. Couch v. Jabe, 737 F. Supp. 2d 561 (W.D. Va. 2010).\n\nAs Section I Part 5 of this Chapter explains, bans on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex (“LGBTQ+”) reading material that is not sexually explicit can also be challenged. However, materials deemed a threat to security or order, or likely to provoke anti-LGBTQ violence, can be lawfully withheld. One example of a case like this is Willson v. Buss, 370 F. Supp. 2d 782, 783 (N.D. Ind. 2005). In that case a court upheld a ban on “blatantly homosexual” materials to minimize prisoner on prisoner violence.\n\nRequiring that Publications Come from Publishers\n\nA prison can usually require that publications come directly from a publisher or bookstore, allegedly to limit smuggling and contraband. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). However, some courts have found these safety concerns only apply to hardcopy books, and found that access to newspapers, magazines, and paperback books should not be restricted. In Hurd v. Williams, 755 F.2d 306 (3d Cir. 1985), for example, a court held that the security problem presented by the binding of hardback books seems inapplicable to newspapers and potentially the binding of other paperback books. And in Keenan v. Hall, 135 F.3d 1318 (9th Cir. 1998) a court noted that in Bell, the Supreme Court relied on the fact that prisoners were allowed other reading material besides hardback books (e.g. magazines and softback books), such that the compelling security interest that justified the publisher-only rule for hardback books might not justify a ban on other reading materials\n\nCensorship of this Handbook\n\nIn Virginia and New Mexico, prison officials tried to ban people from receiving copies of this handbook. However, following lawsuits, these bans were struck down, and the Virginia DOC even agreed to put copies of the JLH in all of its prison law libraries. White v. Dona Ana County Detention Center, 2011 WL 13291138 (D. N.M. 2011) is one of these cases. A prisoner was denied The Jailhouse Lawyer’s Handbook because prisoners were not allowed to receive books in the mail, but the district court held that the Turner test weighed in favor of the prisoner regarding: the prison’s blanket prohibition on magazines and newspapers, mailed books, newsletters, mailed items without a return address, and on mailed items that include “copies”.\n\nIf the JLH is banned from your prison, please write CCR or the NLG! Please include any documentation from prison officials notifying you or others at the prison that it has been banned. And THANK YOU to the people who brought this to our attention!\n\n2. Free Expression of Political Beliefs\n\nP The Basics You can believe whatever you want, but the prison may be able to stop you from writing, talking, or organizing around your beliefs.\n\nYou have the right to your political beliefs. This means that prison officials may not punish you simply because they disagree with your political beliefs. Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971); Sczerbaty v. Oswald, 341 F. Supp. 571 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). However, the prison can limit your ability to express your beliefs. Any prison restriction on your right to express your beliefs must satisfy the Turner test.\n\nPrison officials may be able to limit what you write and publish in prison, but not all of these limitations will pass the Turner standard. For example, the state of Pennsylvania had a prison rule that kept prisoners from carrying on businesses or professions in prison. The court found that the rule was not reasonably related to legitimate governmental interests when it kept Mumia Abu-Jamal from continuing his journalism career. Abu-Jamal v Price, 154 F.3d 128 (3d Cir. 1998). The court relied on evidence that (1) the rule was enforced against Mumia, at least in part, because of the content of his writing, and not because of security concerns; (2) his writing did not create a greater burden within the prison than any other prisoner’s writing; and (3) there were obvious, easy alternatives to the rule that would address security concerns. Another successful case is Jordan v. Pugh, 504 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (D. Co. 2007). In that case, a prisoner at the highest security federal prison in the country (ADX Florence) successfully challenged a Bureau of Prisons rule that said prisoners can’t publish under a byline or act as reporters. The prison said the rule was important to keep a prisoner who published material from becoming a “big shot” at the prison and getting too much influence over other prisoners. However, the prisoner had a former warden testify as an expert for him. The expert convinced the court that this “big shot” theory had no actual support and had been abandoned by prison administrators. It was important under Turner that ADX Florence’s rule was absolute—prisoners had no other way to publish articles.\n\nHowever, regulations limiting prisoners from publishing their work may be constitutional in other situations. In a case called Hendrix v. Evans, 715 F. Supp. 897 (N.D. Ind. 1989), the court held that a prison could stop a prisoner from publishing leaflets to be distributed to the general public about a new law because prisoners still had other ways to inform the public about the issue, such as by individual letters.\n\nOften the prison will rely on “security concerns” to justify censorship. In Pittman v. Hutto, 594 F.2d 407 (4th Cir. 1979), the court held that prison officials did not violate the constitution when they refused to allow publication of an issue of a magazine prepared by people in prison because they had a reasonable belief that the issue might disrupt prison order and security.\n\nSome courts will examine the “security” reason more closely than others to see if it is real or just an excuse. For example, in Castle v. Clymer, 15 F. Supp. 2d 640 (E.D. Pa. 1998), the court held that prison officials violated the constitution when they transferred a prisoner in response to letters he had written to a journalist. The letters mentioned the prisoner’s view that proposed prison regulations would lead to prison riots. The court found that because there was no security risk, the transfer was unreasonable.\n\nPrison officials can ban petitions, like those asking for improvements in prison conditions, as long as prisoners have other ways to voice their complaints, like through the prison grievance system. Duamutef v. O’Keefe, 98 F.3d 22 (2d Cir. 1996). Officials can stop a prisoner from forming an association or union of prisoners, because the courts have decided that it is reasonable to conclude that such organizing activity would threaten prison security. Brooks v. Wainwright, 439 F. Supp. 1335 (M.D. Fl. 1977). In one very important case, the Supreme Court upheld a prison’s ban on union meetings, solicitation of other prisoners to join the union, and bulk mailings from the union to prisoners, as long as there were other ways for prisoners to complain to prison officials and for the union to communicate with prisoners. Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119 (1977).\n\nFinally, lots of times prisons describe organizing among people in prison as “gang activity” and courts are usually pretty deferential to those security concerns. In one case, a person in prison was punished for “gang activity” for having a handwritten copy of material from a book about the Black Panther Party, even though the book itself was checked out from the prison library. Toston v. Thurmer, 689 F.3d 828 (7th Cir. 2012).\n\nWhen speech is directed outside the prison, restrictions may be easier to strike down. For example, after Mumia Abu-Jamal prerecorded a commencement speech for a college, Pennsylvania passed a law to prohibit similar speeches in the future, based on “revictimization.” This is the idea that victims of personal injury crimes are harmed when people in prison exercise the right to free speech. A court said the law violated the First Amendment because it limited speech based on its content. Abu-Jamal v. Kane, 105 F. Supp. 3d 448 (M.D. Penn. 2015).\n\n3. Limits on Censorship of Mail\n\nP The Basics The prison usually can’t stop you from speaking your mind in your letters to people outside the prison. The prison can keep other people from writing you things it considers dangerous. Prison guards can read your letters and look in them to make sure there is no contraband.\n\nThe First Amendment protects your right to send and receive letters. Many years ago, prison officials were required to meet a strict test to justify their needs and interests before courts would allow them to interfere with mail. Today, the court still uses this test for mail prisoners send out of the prison but allows prison officials more control over mail that goes into the prison.\n\na. Outgoing Mail\n\nP The Rule The regulation must protect an “important or substantial interest” of the prison and be necessary and essential to achieving that interest.\n\nIn order to censor the letters you send to people outside prison, prison officials must be able to prove that the censorship is necessary to protect an “important or substantial” interest of the prison. Examples of important interests are: maintaining prison order, preventing criminal activity, and preventing escapes. The prison officials must be able to show that their regulations are actually “necessary and essential” to achieving this important goal, not just that the regulation is intended to achieve that goal. The regulations cannot restrict your rights any more than is required to meet the goal. Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974). This test is better for you than Turner, but unfortunately it only applies to outgoing mail.\n\nUnder the Martinez rule, a prison official cannot censor your mail just because it makes rude comments about the prison or prison staff. Bressman v. Farrier, 825 F. Supp. 231 (N.D. Iowa 1993). In one case, Harrison v. Institutional Gang of Investigations, No. C 07-3824, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14944 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 2010), Marcus Harrison sued Pelican Bay prison officials after they took his outgoing mail because it included information about the Black August Memorial, the New Afrikan Collective Think Tank, and the George Jackson University. The prison argued that the material was related to a prison gang called the Black Guerilla Family. Mr. Harrison won, and the court ruled that the prison had failed to make a substantial showing that the material was likely to incite violence or related to a prison gang.\n\nHowever, some restrictions on outgoing mail are allowed. Courts have allowed bans on “letter kiting,” which means including a letter from someone else with your letter or sending a letter to someone in an envelope with another prisoner’s name. Malsh v. Garcia, 971 F. Supp 133 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). Some prisons and jails have imposed rules limiting prisoners to writing only postcards, as opposed to closed letters. In 2010 the ACLU brought a First Amendment challenge to this type of policy at the El Paso County Jail in Arizona, and the jail quickly agreed to change the rule. Martinez v. Maketa, No. 10-CV-02242, 2011 WL 2222129 (D. Co. June 7, 2011).\n\nIn one case, a court upheld a ban on gang symbols in outgoing mail on grounds of a governmental interest in rehabilitation. The court gave “substantial deference” to prison officials to decide what is a gang symbol. The court also said that the outgoing mail was not “constructive, wholesome contact” that would foster reintegration into society. Koutnik v. Brown, 456 F.3d 777 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\nIf a prisoner has used the mail in the past to attempt to commit a crime or harass someone, that may be an important factor. So for example, in Hammer v. Saffle, No. 91-7038, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 28730 (10th Cir. Nov. 29, 1991), the court upheld a prison rule limiting a prisoner to sending mail to people on an approved list after he was found to have used the mail to make death threats and extort money.\n\nCourts usually allow guards to read or look in your outgoing mail, especially for contraband. Courts explain that looking in a letter does not violate the First Amendment, because it is different from censorship. Altizer v. Deeds, 191 F.3d 540 (4th Cir. 1999). Courts have said that a visual inspection is closely related to the legitimate interest of a prison in preventing prisoners from disseminating offensive or harmful materials. Witherow v. Paff, 52 F.3d 264 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\nCourts have also generally upheld limitations on the amount of postage you can have at one time and the amount of free postage they will provide to prisoners who cannot afford it for non-legal mail. Johnson v. Goord, 445 F.3d 532 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nIn one case, a court held that the First Amendment was not violated by a rule prohibiting solicitation of pen pals. The court accepted the prison’s argument that bulk mailings to find pen pals could be used for scams. Perry v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 664 F.3d 1359 (11th Cir. 2011).\n\nb. Incoming Mail\n\nP The Rule The Turner test applies.\n\nCensorship of incoming mail is governed by the Turner test. As you learned in Section A of this chapter, the Turner test requires that the regulation in question be “reasonably related” to a “legitimate” government interest. This means that while your rights are still protected to some extent, prisons can put a lot of restrictions on incoming mail. Courts have allowed restrictions on incoming packages on the grounds that they can easily hide contraband and looking through them would use up too many prison resources. Weiler v. Purkett, 137 F.3d 1047 (8th Cir. 1998). Items that by themselves are not a threat to prison security can also be taken by prison officials if they contain contraband. Steffey v. Orman, 461 F.3d 1218 (10th Cir. 2006). Courts have also allowed restrictions on mail between prisoners. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).\n\nA prison must follow special procedures to censor your mail. You should be notified if a letter addressed to you is returned to the sender. Your right to be notified is a “due process” right, recognized by Procunier v. Martinez. Due process rights are discussed later in this Chapter, in Sections D and G. The author of the letter sent to you should have an administrative avenue to challenge the censorship. The official who responds to the administrative challenge cannot be the person who originally censored the mail in question. In most places, the same rule applies to packages, not just letters. Bonner v. Outlaw, 552 F.3d 673 (8th Cir. 2009).\n\nSome prisons and jails have imposed rules limiting prisoners to receiving only postcards (different from the outgoing-mail rule discussed above). Some courts have held that these policies are unconstitutional under Turner and serve no valid penological objectives. Prison Legal News v. Columbia County, 942 F. Supp. 2d 1068 (D. Or. 2013). But other courts have allowed postcard-only policies on the basis of reducing contraband. Althouse v. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, No. 12-80135-CIV-MARRA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18602 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 11, 2013). If you are challenging a postcard-only policy for incoming mail, thoroughly consider the Turner factors from Section A, and make sure the prison backs up any claims that a postcard-only policy is “rationally related” to enhanced security.\n\nOne delay or some other relatively short-term disruption in mail delivery that is not related to the content of your letters does not violate the First Amendment. Sizemore v. Williford, 829 F.2d 608 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\nc. Legal Mail\n\nSpecial rules apply to mail between you and your attorney, and to mail you send to non-judicial government bodies or officials. This mail is called “privileged mail,” “legal mail,” or “special mail” and is protected by your constitutional right to seek legal counsel as well as by the “attorney-client privilege.” The attorney-client privilege means that the things you write or say to your attorney, or they write or say to you, are secret.\n\nPrisons officials cannot read your legal mail. But they can open it in your presence to inspect it for contraband. Castillo v. Cook County Mail Room, 990 F.2d 304 (7th Cir. 1993); Bieregu v. Reno, 59 F.3d 1445 (3d Cir. 1995). If they open it outside your presence, this may violate the First Amendment, because it chills your right to communicate confidentially with your lawyer. Al-Amin v. Smith, 511 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir. 2008), Jones v. Brown, 461 F.3d 353 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\nEven if a prison restricts most of your correspondence with other prisoners, you may be allowed to send and get mail from a prisoner who is a jailhouse lawyer. For more information about this, read Section G about your right to access the court.\n\nDifferent prisons have different procedures for marking incoming and outgoing legal and special mail. Often, incoming mail from an attorney must bear the address of a licensed attorney and be marked on the envelope as “legal mail.” If not, it will not be treated as privileged. Some prisons place even more requirements on you and require you to request ahead of time that legal mail be opened only in your presence, and your attorney must have identified themself to the prison in advance. U.S. v. Stotts, 925 F.2d 83 (4th Cir. 1991); Boswell v. Mayor, 169 F.3d 384 (6th Cir. 1999); Gardner v. Howard; 109 F.3d 427 (8th Cir. 1997).\n\n4. Access to the Telephone\n\nP The Basics Most of the time, you have a right to make some phone calls, but the prison can limit the amount of calls you can make and can monitor those calls.\n\nYour right to talk with friends and family on the telephone gets some protection under the First Amendment. However, courts do not all agree on how much telephone access prisoners must be allowed. Prisons may limit the number of calls you make. The prison can also limit how long you talk. Courts disagree on how strict these limits can be. Most courts agree that prison officials can restrict your telephone privileges in “a reasonable manner.” McMaster v. Pung, 984 F.2d 948 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\nThere is no right to private telephone calls with family and friends. Some courts have said this is because people in prison do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. U.S. v. Balon, 384 F.3d 38 (2d Cir. 2004). See Section E of this Chapter for more information about your privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nOther courts have held that prisoners who are told that they are being monitored consent to giving up their privacy. U.S. v. Morin, 437 F.3d 777 (8th Cir. 2006); U.S. v. Footman, 215 F.3d 145 (1st Cir. 2000). In other words, if there is a sign under the phone saying that “all calls are monitored” or it’s in the prison’s manual or its policies, it doesn’t violate your rights for the prison to listen in.\n\nOne exception is that prison officials cannot listen in on calls with your attorney. If there is a process in your prison for requesting an unmonitored legal call and the prison still monitors them, courts may find that your expectation of privacy has been violated. Robinson v. Gunja, 92 Fed. Appx 624 (10th Cir. 2004). However, if you don’t follow your prison’s procedure for making a legal call, and simply use the regular phone, some courts will conclude that you waived your attorney-client privilege by having the conversation after you were “told” of the monitoring by the sign or prison policies.\n\nPrisons are generally allowed to place more severe restrictions on telephone access for prisoners who are confined to Special Housing Units for disciplinary reasons as long as they can show that these restrictions are reasonably related to legitimate security concerns about these prisoners. You can also lose telephone access as punishment for breaking prison rules.\n\nIn general, prisons are allowed to limit the number of different people whom you can call, and to require you to register the names of those people on a list to be approved by the prison. Pope v. Hightower, 101 F.3d 1382 (11th Cir. 1996); Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\nThe prison can make you pay for your telephone calls. This can be a serious burden on prisoners and their family members, especially when states enter into private contracts with phone companies which force prisoners or their families to pay much more for their phone calls than what people pay outside of prison. Challenges to these types of contracts or to excessive telephone charges in general have not been successful. See Arsberry v. Illinois, 244 F.3d 558 (7th Cir. 2001); Walton v. New York State Dept. of Correctional Services, 869 N.Y.S.2d 661 (2008). But at least one court has held that this type of arrangement might violate prisoners’ (and their loves ones’) First Amendment rights. Byrd v. Goord, No. 00-cv-2135 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18544 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2005).\n\n5. Access to the Internet\n\nP The Basics The Turner test applies to Internet communication. Prison Officials can keep you from accessing the Internet.\n\nPeople in prison do not have a right to computers or Internet access. Carmony v. County of Sacramento, No. CIV S-05-1679, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11137 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2008). The Bureau of Prisons has a system called the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer System (TRULINCS) which makes a form of e-mail available to prisoners. But even when a prison system allows e-mail generally, they can still restrict it without violating the First Amendment. In one unpublished decision, Solan v. Zickefoose, a person in prison was barred from using TRULINCS e-mail because he was a computer expert and was previously punished for misusing computers. The Third Circuit held that the restriction passed the Turner test because there were other alternatives to e-mail, like letters, visits, or the telephone. Solan v. Zickefoose, 530 Fed. Appx. 109 (3d Cir. 2013). Courts have also accepted arguments that surveillance of TRULINCS uses up resources so saving money is a reason to restrict e-mail access. Gatch v. Walton, No. 13-cv-1168-MJR, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171940 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 5, 2013).\n\nSome people in prison may try to tell people outside prison to post things on the Internet. An example would be telling someone to make a Facebook or Twitter post. Several states have laws banning this kind of indirect access to the Internet. Texas, for example, prevents prisoners from using any social media through a third party. Courts have taken different approaches to the question. One district court in Arizona held a third-party social media access law unconstitutional. Canadian Coalition Against the Death Penalty v. Ryan, 269 F. Supp. 2d 1199 (D. Ariz. 2003). There are not many cases on this issue.\n\nUsing social media like Facebook directly from prison can often lead to severe disciplinary actions and loss of privileges including loss of telephone, visitation, and good time. Those penalties can be just as severe if you use a third party to post online and your state bans this, so it is important to check whether your state bans third-party social media use before having someone post for you.\n\nSome prisons ban people in prison from receiving printouts of Internet pages in the mail. In one case, Clement v. Cal. Dep’t. of Corrections, a prisoner at Pelican Bay State Prison successfully challenged a policy banning materials printed from the Internet. The prison defended the ban by claiming that printed Internet materials increased the burden of mail volume and could be used to send encoded messages. However, the Ninth Circuit held that those concerns were arbitrary. Clement v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 364 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2004). Other courts have held similarly. However, courts have also upheld such policies. Starr v. Coulombe, 368 Fed. Appx. 156 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n6. Your Right to Receive Visits from Family and Friends and to Maintain Relationships in Prison.\n\nP The Basics The prison can limit your visits in lots of ways, but probably can’t permanently ban you from getting visits.\n\nIf you are being denied visitation in prison, there are several different claims you can make. You can argue that denying you visits or restricting your visits violates your right to freedom of association under the First Amendment, your right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, and your right to substantive due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Under each of these claims, the prison will probably respond by claiming that the restriction you challenge is related to maintaining order and security. If you bring your claim under the First Amendment or the due process clause, the court will look to the Turner test to see if the prison rule is valid. If you bring your claim under the Eighth Amendment, the court will look at the standard described in Section F of this Chapter. You can make all of these arguments in one case.\n\na. Access to Visits\n\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court considered how much prisons can restrict visitation in a case called Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126 (2003). The case involved a Michigan Department of Corrections’ rule that prohibited visits by kids other than a prisoner’s sibling or child. The rule also said that former prisoners couldn’t visit current prisoners. Lastly, the rule said that any prisoner who had two drug violations in prison would have all of their visitation privileges suspended for two years. A group of prisoners and their friends and family challenged the rule based on all of the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment theories mentioned earlier. The Court stated that the right to “intimate association” is not completely terminated by imprisonment and considered the regulations under the Turner standard. The Court decided that all of these prison rules were reasonably related to valid penological interests, so they passed the Turner test. The Court accepted the prison’s explanation that allowing only children and siblings under the age of 18 protects minors from misconduct, reduces the number of visitors, and minimizes disruption by children. The prison rationalized preventing former prisoners from visiting as a way to maintain prison security and prevent future crime. It explained restricting visitation for prisoners with two drug violations as a way to discourage drug use. Such prisoners, the Court explained, are still able to write or call people, so they were not completely cut off from their friends and family. In considering the Eighth Amendment claim, the Court said that the two-year ban was “not a dramatic departure from accepted standards for conditions of confinement [and it did not] create inhumane prison conditions, deprive prisoners of basic necessities, or fail to protect their health or safety. Nor does it involve the infliction of pain or injury, or deliberate indifference to the risk that it might occur.”\n\nUnder this precedent, it is hard to successfully challenge restrictions on visitation. In general, limitations on a prisoner's visitation rights are acceptable if the prison has valid “penological objectives such as rehabilitation and the maintenance of security and order.” Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 420 (6th Cir. 1984). See also Pitts v. Gramiak, No. 5:14-CV-43-MTT-CHW, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65400 (M.D. Ga. May 13, 2014); Lynott v. Henderson, 610 F.2d 340 (11th Cir. 1980); King v. Caruso, 542 F. Supp. 2d 703 (E.D. Mich. 2008). The Overton case didn’t overrule the old cases about visit restrictions, because most of the old cases also used the Turner standard, or something like it. But most courts don’t look very critically at restrictions on visitation.\n\nThere are a few exceptions. Prisoners who are subject to complete bans on visits probably have the best chance of a successful challenge. In Hallal v. Hopkins, 947 F. Supp. 978 (S.D. Miss. 1995) for example, a prisoner and his wife filed a pro se lawsuit challenging conditions and policies at the Madison County Detention Center, including a complete ban on visits by children under twelve. The court ordered an evidentiary hearing to decide the factual basis for the ban, and whether it was justified by security needs. And in one recent case, Ryerse v. Caruso, No. 1:08-cv-516, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82839 (W.D. Mich. July 20, 2009), a prisoner, his mother and his children sued over a prison policy that permanently denied him all visits after he was convicted of smuggling contraband into the prison. The Court allowed the case to move forward, citing the Supreme Court’s statement in Overton v. Bazetta that a permanent ban on all visitation might be unconstitutional.\n\nCourts probably will allow a ban on visitation by minors if the prisoner's crime involved minors, Morton v. Hall, 455 F. Supp. 2d 1066 (C.D. Cal. 2006), and courts also allow transferring a person to a prison far from home or family, even though this makes visitation very difficult. Olim v. Wakinekona, 103 S. Ct. 1741 (1983). One court allowed temporary suspension of visits of minors after a person in prison had a sexual phone call with his wife when his child was on the phone (even though the prisoner claimed that he did not know). Dunn v. Castro, 621 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2010). Also, prisons can require visitors to be pre-approved and can restrict the type of contact you have during a contact visit, like how close you can sit and when you can hug or kiss.\n\nIn another case, a person in prison was denied visitation privileges for two years after a guard claimed he saw the prisoner put something in his mouth and swallow. Even though a contraband search turned up nothing and he was not charged with a disciplinary offense, the court dismissed his case challenging the visitation ban. Williams v. Ozmint, 716 F.3d 801 (4th Cir. 2013).\n\nVisitation Rights of LGBTQ+ People in Custody\n\nLGBTQ+ people can also bring challenges if they are subjected to more restrictive visitation policies than other people in custody. For more background, see Section I Part 1 of this Chapter.\n\nOther Issues\n\nMany courts agree that a blanket policy of strip-searching prisoners after contact visits is constitutional. Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff's Dept., 354 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2003). See Section E of this Chapter for more details about strip searches.\n\nA new issue is the use of video visitation systems, which are now being used in over 500 prisons around the country. Where this technology is not yet in place, courts have not found that people in prison have a right to video visitation. Young v. Scott, No: 2:16-cv-44-FtM-38MRM, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135598 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 24, 2017).\n\nThe use of video conferencing has also made people worry that prisons might use it as an excuse to limit in-person visitation. We expect more cases about this issue in the future.\n\nSome prisons are employing scanning technologies for prisoners and visitors. Challenges against the use of these technologies are unlikely to succeed, so long as the devices are used to achieve a government interest (such as finding contraband) and are minimally invasive and not used to harass. In one case, Zboralski v. Sanders, No. 06 C 3772, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79362 (N.D. Ill. July 29, 2010), a visitor sued after receiving a ‘Rapiscan’ backscatter x-ray radiation device in order to visit her husband. The court found no Fourth Amendment violation because there was little intrusiveness and no evidence of harm by the search, weighed against an interest in screening visitors.\n\nb. Caring for Your Child in Prison\n\nIf you have children, being incarcerated almost always means being separated from them, and this is likely to impose a substantial burden on your relationship. There have not been many court cases about your right to care for your child while you are in prison. In general, states do not allow incarcerated mothers or fathers to care for their children, even infants. However, some states have tried to make parenting in prison easier.\n\nNo matter what state you are in, you can take steps to maintain your relationship with your child. If possible, you should privately arrange to have someone you know care for your children and plan visiting times. If a family member is willing but cannot afford to care for your child, they may be able to get assistance from the state. If your child is in foster care, state statutes often require the foster care agency to actively support your parental relationship by updating you on your child’s development, allowing you to participate in planning for your child’s future and health, and bringing your child to visit (unless the child lives in another state).\n\nAs a prisoner, however, you face the possibility that your parental rights could be “terminated.” The federal Adoption and Safe Families Act requires the state to move to “terminate,” or end, your parental rights if your child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months. There are exceptions if the child is being cared for by a relative or there is a good reason why termination is not in the best interests of the child. 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(E).\n\nThe Supreme Court held in Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982), that in order to terminate your parental rights, the state must show that you are an unfit parent by “clear and convincing evidence.” What it means to be an unfit parent varies from state to state, so you should check your state’s statutes. Many states have held that the fact that you are in prison does not necessarily make you unfit. An example of some of these cases are: In re R.I.S., 614 Pa. 275 (Pa. 2011); In re Interest of Josiah T., 17 Neb. App. 919 (Neb. 2009); B.C. v. Florida Dept. of Children & Families, 887 So.2d 1046 (Fla. 2004); In re Parental Rights of J.L.N., 118 Nev. 621 (Nev. 2002). However, states don’t like long term foster care, so if your sentence is long (more than 5 years) you may be in danger of having your parental rights terminated unless you can find a private placement for your child.\n\nYou may want to write to the judge to request to be present at any court hearings regarding your child’s care, including foster care status hearings and parental termination proceedings. Although in Lassiter v. Department of Social Services of Durham County North Carolina, 453 U.S. 927 (1981) the Supreme Court said there is no constitutional right to a lawyer at parental termination proceedings, most states do guarantee a lawyer, so you should request one. The American Bar Association maintains a list of right to counsel statutes. For some examples, you can read Texas Family Code Annotated § 107.013(a)(1); Arkansas Code Annotated § 9-27- 316(h)(1) (Supp. 2003); and In re B., 285 N.E.2d 288 (N.Y. 1972).\n\nTo protect your parental rights, you should participate in planning for your child as much as possible, contact your child’s caseworker frequently if your child is in foster care, make efforts to arrange visiting times, and keep a detailed record of all visits, phone calls, and letters between you and your child or related to your child’s care.\n\nYou should also participate in any parenting classes or treatment programs at your facility that will help show that you will be able to be a good parent when you get out, especially if they are suggested by your child’s caseworker. When you go to court, you can emphasize this participation to try to get the court to look beyond your crime.\n\nF Your Right to be Free from Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\nYour Right to be Free from Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\nThe Eighth Amendment forbids “cruel and unusual punishment” and is probably the most important amendment for prisoners. It has been interpreted to prohibit excessive force and guard brutality, as well as unsanitary, dangerous, or overly restrictive conditions. It is also the source for your right to medical care in prison.\n\n1. Your Right to Be Free from Physical Brutality and Sexual Assault by Prison Staff\n\nP The Rule A use of force is excessive and violates the Eighth Amendment when it is not applied in an effort to maintain or restore discipline, but is used to maliciously and sadistically cause harm. Where a prison official is responsible for unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, the Eighth Amendment has been violated.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that guards do NOT have the right to beat you or harm you unless their action is considered justified given the situation.\n\na. Use of Excessive Force and Physical Brutality by Prison Officials\n\n“Excessive force” is any physical contact by a guard that is meant to cause harm rather than keep order.\n\n“Excessive force” by prison guards is cruel and unusual punishment. In a very important Supreme Court case called Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992), the Court found a violation of the Eighth Amendment when prison officials punched and kicked a prisoner, leaving him with minor bruises, swelling of his face and mouth, and loose teeth. The Court held that a guard’s use of force violates the Eighth Amendment when it is not applied “in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,” but instead is used to “maliciously and sadistically cause harm.” To prevail under Hudson, a two-part test applies. First you must show that prison officials “acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind” (the subjective element)—i.e., not for a legitimate penological purpose, but “maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,” and (2) the harm caused was more than “de minimis”. “De minimis” means so trivial it’s not even worth considering.\n\nIn applying this test to excessive force claims, judges may consider:\n\nThe need for force;\n\nWhether the amount of force used was justified given the need;\n\nHow serious the need for force appeared to the guards;\n\nWhether the guard made efforts to use as little force as necessary; and\n\nHow badly you were hurt.\n\nThis means that to win on an excessive-force claim, you will have to show that more force was used against you than was justified given the situation, but you do not have to show injury. It is usually enough to show some harm, even if it is relatively minor. In 2010 the Supreme Court made it clear that a prisoner can win an excessive force case even if they are not seriously injured. Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. 34 (2010). In Wilkins, the Supreme Court explained that a beating is excessive force, even if it doesn’t result in injuries that require medical care. De minimis harm, on the other hand, is something like a push or a shove that does not inflict pain or injury.\n\nThe most important thing to prove is “whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”\n\nThis is about the “state of mind” of prison officials. “Maliciously and sadistically” means harm that is cruel, done for the purpose of hurting someone, and is uncalled-for. You can meet this requirement by showing that the force used was not a necessary or reasonable part of keeping order.\n\nFor example, one court found an Eighth Amendment violation when an officer repeatedly hit a prisoner even though the prisoner had immediately obeyed an order to lie face down on the floor and was already being restrained by four other officers. Estate of Davis by Ostenfeld v. Delo, 115 F.3d 1388 (8th Cir. 1997). In another successful case, the prisoner was handcuffed and hit several times in the head and shoulders while in a kneeling position. Brown v. Lippard, 472 F.3d 384 (5th Cir. 2006). On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit held that there was no Eighth Amendment violation when a prisoner was shot in the neck during a major prison disturbance because the court found that the officer was trying to restore order. Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895 (9th Cir. 2001). The Eighth Circuit said pepper spraying a prisoner’s genitals was not excessive force when the prison said he was refusing orders to submit to wrist restraints and being unruly. Ward v. Smith, 844 F.3d 717 (8th Cir. 2016).\n\nWith mechanical restraints, you might be able to bring an “excessive force” claim even if the prison says the treatment is just a “condition of confinement” (which is a separate category and discussed below). For example, in Young v. Martin, 801 F.3d 172 (3d Cir. 2015), an appeals court applied the excessive-force test when a prisoner was forced into a restraint chair and remained naked there for fourteen hours.\n\nUnfortunately, many courts have found that prison officials who only make verbal threats of physical harm do not violate the Eighth Amendment. See Walton v. Terry, 38 F. App'x 363, 364–65 (9th Cir. 2002) (“verbal threats do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.”); Turner v. Mull, 784 F.3d 485, 492 (8th Cir. 2015) (threatening to drown plaintiff without taking further action was not unconstitutional). But in Lisle v. Welborn, 933 F.3d 705, 710 (7th Cir. 2019), the Seventh Circuit found that a plaintiff who was taunted for his failed suicide attempts and encouraged to try again had a valid Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nNOTE: As with many of the other types of claims described in this Handbook, please remember that a constitutional claim in federal court is not your only option. In a guard brutality case, it may be simpler to bring a “tort” case in state court.\n\nb. Sexual Assault and Abuse by Prison Officials\n\nRape and sexual assault by prison staff also violates the Eighth Amendment. See Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1197 (9th Cir. 2000) (sexual assaults by guards violate the Eighth Amendment “regardless of the gender of the guard or of the prisoner”); Smith v. Cochran, 339 F.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2003) (assault by prison work program supervisor violates the Eighth Amendment).\n\nFor sexual assault by prison officials, the two-part test from Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992) applies. However, this test can be easier to meet here because sexual assault is very harmful and violates contemporary standards of decency without a legitimate penological purpose, even in cases where there is no physical injury. See Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S. 34, 40 (2010) (explaining claims can proceed even if physical injury is “de minimis”).\n\nSexual abuse that falls short of rape can violate the Eighth Amendment as well. Some courts like the Second and Eleventh Circuits require the sexual abuse to be “severe or repetitive” in order for plaintiffs to prevail. See Sconiers v. Lockhart, 946 F.3d 1256, 1266–67 (11th Cir. 2020), Crawford v. Cuomo, 796 F.3d 252 (2d Cir. 2015). But one severe, isolated incident can meet this standard.\n\nIn Daskalea v. District of Columbia, 227 F.3d 433 (D.C. Cir. 2000), a court of appeals upheld a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment claim where she was forced to do a striptease in front of all the prisoners and officers at her facility. The court found deliberate indifference based on the plaintiff’s repeated filing of grievance claims and letters to officials seeking help, as well as the widespread and ongoing pattern of harassment and sexual assault at the facility. The District argued that it was not deliberately indifferent because it had a policy in place prohibiting such behavior, but the court rejected this argument because it found that no prisoner had ever received a copy of the policy, only a few employees remembered receiving it, and it had never been posted anywhere in the facility.\n\nA pat or strip search can violate the Eighth Amendment too if conducted in a sexual manner to humiliate a prisoner (Fourth Amendment claims for searches are discussed in Section E above). One good case to read for this issue is Crawford v. Cuomo, 796 F.3d 252 (2d Cir. 2015). That case involved a guard searching a prisoner by grabbing his genitals and taunting him. The Second Circuit said that intentionally touching genitalia or intimate areas for the officer’s pleasure or to humiliate the prisoner violates the Eighth Amendment. Another is Sconiers v. Lockhart, 946 F.3d 1256, 1266–67 (11th Cir. 2020), where an appeals court found that a guard who shoved his finger into the plaintiff’s anus outside the context of an approved body-cavity search violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\nBut in Berryhill v. Schriro, 137 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir. 1998), a court rejected the Eighth Amendment claim of a plaintiff who was briefly touched on the buttocks by prison staff in an attempt to embarrass him, without any accompanying sexual advances.\n\nYou can bring a claim for commission of a sexual act under the PLRA even if it does not result in physical injury. For purposes of this exception, 18 U.S.C. § 2246 defines a sexual act as follows:\n\nA. contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus, and…contact involving the penis occurs upon penetration, however slight;\n\nB. contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus;\n\nC. the penetration, however slight, of the anal or genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person; or\n\nD. the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the genitalia of another person who has not attained the age of 16 years with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\n\nFor more on the PLRA’s physical injury requirement that applies in cases that do not involve sexual assault, read Chapter Four, Section C.\n\nRape and sexual assault can also result in criminal prosecution of the guard or person responsible. Congress and most states have passed laws criminalizing rape or sexual assault of a prisoner by a correctional officer. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2242 and 2243 (making prison sexual assault unlawful). The Washington College of Law’s Project on Addressing Prison Rape has put together a survey of all state criminal laws prohibiting sexual abuse of individuals in custody at https://www.wcl.american.edu/impact/initiatives-programs/endsilence/research-guidance/.\n\nIf you are assaulted or witness an assault, consider reporting it immediately and you may also want to think about preserving potential evidence like DNA samples and the clothes you wore during the assault.\n\nc. Sexual Harassment and Verbal Abuse by Guards\n\nIn rare cases, sexually explicit comments and verbal abuse by prison officials can also violate the Eighth Amendment. See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 530 (1984) (stating “calculated harassment unrelated to prison needs” can also violate the Eighth Amendment). But it is a difficult standard to meet. Just as courts do not always recognize the seriousness of sexual harassment outside of prison, they do not acknowledge the harm that verbal sexual abuse or less invasive sexual touching can cause in prison. Courts often call sexual harassment by prison guards “outrageous” or “reprehensible” but do not find it unconstitutional. This is unfortunate.\n\nIn Beal v. Foster, 803 F.3d 356, 358 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit found that prison officials who made lewd sexual comments and gestures and called the plaintiff a “punk, fag, sissy, and queer” may have violated the Eighth Amendment because the conduct caused the plaintiff severe psychological harm, and being labeled LGBTQ+ increased his risk of abuse and assault.\n\nOther cases failed to find Eighth Amendment violations despite noting the seriously inappropriate behavior of prison officials. For example, one court found that it was not cruel and unusual punishment when a corrections official repeatedly made sexual comments about a female prisoner’s body to her, including one instance when he entered her cell while she was sleeping and commented on her breasts. Adkins v. Rodriguez, 59 F.3d 1034 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nBut not all courts have been so insensitive to the effects of sexual harassment. In Women Prisoners of District of Columbia Department of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the court upheld a decision ordering a prison to adopt a new sexual harassment policy that prohibited conduct including: “(1) all unwelcome sexual activity directed by any DCDC employee at a prisoner including acts of sexual intercourse, oral sex, or sexual touching, and any attempt to commit these acts; and (2) all unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature directed by any DCDC employee at a prisoner.” Id. at 933.\n\nd. “Consensual” Sex between Prisoners and Guards\n\nCourts disagree about whether a correctional officer can be held liable for having sex with a prisoner when the prisoner consents to the act. In Carrigan v. Davis, 70 F. Supp. 2d 448 (D. Del. 1999), a federal court in Delaware held that a guard had violated the Eighth Amendment by engaging in vaginal intercourse with a prisoner under his supervision, whether or not she had consented. The court relied on Delaware state law that made it a crime for a correctional officer to have sex with a prisoner, whether or not it was consensual.\n\nIn Freitas v. Ault, 109 F.3d 1335 (8th Cir. 1997), however, the Eighth Circuit found that consensual sex does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it does not cause any pain, according to that court’s definition. Other cases like this are Graham v. Sheriff of Logan County, 741 F.3d 1118 (10th Cir. 2013) and McGregor v. Jarvis, No. 9:08-CV-770, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97408 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2010).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has looked at the issue differently. In Wood v. Beauclair, 692 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir. 2012) the court explained that because the relationship between officers and prisoners is coercive, the court assumes that a prisoner cannot consent unless the officers prove otherwise. This means the burden is on the officers to give proof that no coercion occurred.\n\nToday, the federal government and most states have statutes making it a crime for a correctional employee to have intercourse with a person in prison, regardless of whether or not that person consents. A federal law, 18 U.S.C. § 2243, criminalizes sexual intercourse or other physical conduct between an officer and prisoner in any federal prison. You can check out the resources listed earlier in this section for state laws on sexual contact between guards and prisoners.\n\ne. Challenging Prison Supervisors and Prison Policies\n\nIf you are a victim of sexual abuse in prison, you may wish to sue not only the person who abused you but also that person’s supervisors. Or, you may want to challenge some of your prison’s policies. You can sue prison supervisors for allowing you to be raped or assaulted by a guard or another prisoner under the deliberate-indifference standard explained in the next section.\n\nIf you are considering this type of case, be sure to read the section on special issues about suing supervisors in Chapter Four, Section D.\n\nIn one major case, women in prison successfully challenged the policies regarding sexual harassment in Washington, D.C. prisons. The court in that case, Women Prisoners of District of Columbia Department of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cir. 1996), ordered the prison to implement a new prisoner grievance procedure so that prisoners could report sexual harassment confidentially and get a prompt response, and to start a confidential hotline for women to report instances of abuse, and to create a mandatory training program on sexual harassment for all corrections officers in D.C. prisons.\n\nStates also may be liable for sexual abuse if facilities have a policy and practice of permitting male staff to view and supervise incarcerated women, especially in isolated or remote settings, without female staff present. Cash v. Erie County, No. 04-CV-0182C(F), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50129 (W.D.N.Y. July 10, 2007). You may also want to read a later decision in the same case: Cash v. Erie County, 654 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2011).\n\nIn another case, however, women in prison attempted but failed to challenge a county’s policies regarding sexual harassment after they were sexually abused by a prison employee. The court held that a municipality can only be accountable for an Eighth Amendment violation when it shows deliberate indifference and explained that deliberate indifference only exists where a municipality has actual notice that its actions or failures to act will result in a constitutional violation, or when it is highly predictable that a constitutional violation will occur. Since the county in this case did provide training programs addressing sexual harassment and prisoner-officer relations to the officer convicted of abuse, the court did not find deliberate indifference. Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\nFinally, if you have been sexually assaulted in detention, you may want to obtain a copy of Just Detention International’s booklet, Hope for Healing: Information for Survivors of Sexual Assault in Detention (2009) at https://www.prearesourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/library/hopeforhealingweb.pdf, or by writing to Just Detention International, 3325 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 340, Los Angeles, CA 90010.\n\n2. Your Right to Be Free from Physical and Sexual Assault by Other Incarcerated People\n\nEveryone has a right to be free from physical and sexual assault in prison, including at the hands of other incarcerated people. This was established in an important Supreme Court case called Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), which found that “prison officials have a duty . . . to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners” under the Eighth Amendment, including violence in the form of sexual assault. Id. at 833.\n\nTo bring a failure-to-protect claim regarding physical or sexual assault, you need to show “deliberate indifference.” This requires proof that:\n\n1. Guards knew that there was a substantial risk you would be seriously harmed; and\n\n2. They failed to respond reasonably to protect you.\n\nIf you feel you’re at risk, do not wait until you are attacked to ask for help or protection, such as placement in protective custody. That way, prison officials will be on notice of your risk and will have a duty to respond.\n\na. Failure to Protect from Prisoner Sexual Assault\n\nPrison officials who do not take reasonable steps to protect you from sexual assault by other prisoners violate your clearly established rights under the Eighth Amendment and Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994). Here, Farmer’s familiar two-part test applies: First, you must show prison officials knew you stood a substantial risk of serious harm from assault. Second, you must show they did not take reasonable steps to protect you.\n\nTo argue that prison officials unreasonably disregarded an excessive risk to your safety, it can be helpful to mention if prison officials violated your prison’s own policies on safety and sexual assault prevention. It may also be useful to mention the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 15601 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 115 et seq. (collectively “PREA”). PREA instructs federal and state prisons, jails, lockups, and immigration detention centers to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to sexual abuse. PREA also details steps that prison officials can take to protect vulnerable people in custody, such as LGBTQ+ people and people with a history of sexual abuse.\n\nAlthough PREA does not offer a legal remedy for violations, you can use it to support your Eighth Amendment claim by citing it as evidence that prison officials knew of but disregarded your substantial risk of harm.\n\nb. Failure to Protect from Prisoner Physical Abuse\n\nYou can also use Farmer v. Brennan’s two-part test to sue prison officials under the Eighth Amendment if they fail to protect you from being attacked by another incarcerated person. In Harper v. Dourrette, 107 Fed. Appx. 444 (5th Cir. 2004), a court explained that it is not reasonable for guards to do nothing after a prisoner has reported a substantial risk of injury.\n\nSometimes a court will find that prison officials acted reasonably, even if they knew of a substantial risk, and failed to prevent a prisoner from being harmed. In Walls v. Tadman, 762 F.3d 778 (8th Cir. 2014), a prisoner who reported a risk of attack was placed in protective custody and then told the guards there was no longer a risk and asked to go back to general population. The prison did so, and he was attacked while in general population. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against his failure-to-protect claim because it found the guards acted reasonably given the prisoner’s request. And in Longoria v. Texas, 473 F. 3d 586 (5th Cir. 2006), the court ruled that prison officials did not have to endanger their own safety to protect a plaintiff who was being stabbed.\n\nIf you are at risk of assault but are denied protective custody because of a disability, you may be able to bring a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In Bradley v. Wexford, Inc., 2019 Dist. LEXIS 115532 (D.D. Ill. 2019), a plaintiff’s ADA claim was allowed to go forward when he was denied access to protective custody because he was a wheelchair user.\n\n3. Your Right to Decent Conditions in Prison\n\nP The Rule Prison officials violate the Eighth Amendment when they act with deliberate indifference to a prison condition that exposes a prisoner to an unreasonable risk of serious harm or deprives a prisoner of a basic human need.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that you have a right to humane conditions in prison. Conditions that are harsh but not harmful do not violate the Constitution.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment protects your right to safe and humane conditions in prison. You can challenge prison conditions that are unsafe or that deprive you of a “basic human need,” such as shelter, food, exercise, clothing, sanitation, and hygiene. However, the standard for unconstitutional conditions is high: courts allow conditions that are “restrictive and even harsh.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 346 (1981). You must have evidence of conditions that are serious and extreme.\n\nTo challenge prison conditions using the Eighth Amendment, you must meet both “objective” and “subjective” requirements. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991). To meet the objective Eighth Amendment standard, you need to show that you were deprived of a basic human need or exposed to serious harm. Under the subjective part of the test, you usually must show that the prison official you are suing knew you were being deprived or harmed and did not respond reasonably. You must also show how you were injured and prove that the denial of a basic need caused your injury.\n\nUnder the objective part of the test, the court will look at whether the condition or conditions you are challenging could seriously affect your health or safety. In considering a condition, a court will think about how bad it is and how long it has lasted. Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299 (10th Cir. 1998). You must show that you were injured either physically or psychologically, though courts do not agree on how severe the injury must be. You may challenge conditions even without an injury if you can show that the condition puts you at serious risk for an injury in the future, like secondhand smoke. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993).\n\nUnder the subjective part of the test, you must show that the official you are suing acted with “deliberate indifference.” Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991). This is an important legal term. It means that the official knew of the condition and did not respond to it in a reasonable manner. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994). One way to show this is by proving that the condition was so obvious that the official must either know about it or be purposefully ignoring it. Courts will also consider any complaints or grievance reports that you or other prisoners have filed, Vance v. Peters, 97 F.3d 987 (7th Cir. 1996), as well as prison records that refer to the problem. Prison officials cannot ignore a problem once it is brought to their attention.\n\nPrison officials may try to argue that the prison does not have enough money to fix problems, but courts have generally not accepted this defense. Carty v. Turnbull, 144 F. Supp. 2d 395 (D.V.I. 2001). It is important to note that while there is a subjective component to Eighth Amendment claims, you do not need to show why prison officials acted as they did.\n\nRemember that courts disagree on whether the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) means that you can’t get damages if you only prove emotional or mental injury without any physical injury. This provision will not affect a lawsuit that tries to change conditions (injunctive relief). However, it may be difficult to get money damages for exposure to unsafe or overly restrictive conditions unless they have caused you a physical injury. The courts are not in agreement on this issue, so you may want to just include these claims anyway and hope for the best.\n\nBelow are some of the most common Eighth Amendment challenges to prison conditions. Remember, to prevail on a claim for any of these, you must show both subjective and objective evidence.\n\nFood: Prisons are required to serve food that is nutritious and prepared under clean conditions. Robles v. Coughlin, 725 F.2d 12 (2d Cir. 1983). Meals cannot be denied as retaliation, since denying meals (usually several meals; one denial will most likely not succeed) can be a deprivation of a life necessity, violating the Eight Amendment. Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807 (9th Cir 2009). However, as long as the prison diet meets nutritional standards, prisons can serve pretty much whatever they want, including prison “loaf.” Prisons must provide a special diet for prisoners whose health requires it. Byrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592 (6th Cir. 2013).\n\nExercise: Prisons must provide prisoners with opportunities for exercise outside of their cells. Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. 1996); Delaney v. DeTella, 256 F.3d 679 (7th Cir. 2001). Courts have not agreed upon the minimum amount of time for exercise required, and it may be different depending on whether you are in the general population or segregation. One court considered three hours per week adequate, Hosna v. Groose, 80 F.3d 298, 306 (8th Cir. 1996), while another approved of just one hour per week for a maximum-security prisoner, Bailey v. Shillinger, 828 F.2d 651 (10th Cir. 1987). Some circuits have determined that prisoners cannot be deprived of outdoor exercise for long periods of time. Hearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 2005). Prisons must provide adequate space and equipment for exercise, but again, there is no clear standard for this. It is generally acceptable to limit exercise opportunities for a short time or during emergencies.\n\nAir Quality and Temperature: Prisoners have successfully challenged air quality when it posed a serious danger to their health, particularly in cases of secondhand smoke, Talal v. White, 403 F.3d 423 (6th Cir. 2005); Alvarado v. Litscher, 267 F.3d 648 (7th Cir. 2001); asbestos, LaBounty v. Coughlin, 137 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 1998) and radon gas, Vega v. Semple, 963 F.3d 259 (2d Cir. 2020). While you are not entitled to a specific air temperature, you should not be subjected to extreme heat or cold, and should be given bedding and clothing appropriate for the temperature. Bibbs v. Early, 541 F.3d 267 (5th Cir. 2008); Gaston v. Coughlin, 249 F.3d 156 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\nSanitation and Personal Hygiene: Prisoners are entitled to sanitary toilet facilities, proper trash procedures, no roach or rat infestations, and basic supplies such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, sanitary napkins, razors, and cleaning products. Womble v. Chrisman, 770 F. App'x 918, 925 (10th Cir. 2019) (denial of clean toilets & showers); Fountain v. Rupert, 819 F. App'x 215, 219 (5th Cir. 2020) (unsanitary conditions and inadequate nutrition); Gillis v. Litscher, 468 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2006) (denial of mattress, bedding, clothing, soap); DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965 (10th Cir. 2001) (repeated floodings). In Taylor v. Riojas, 141 S. Ct. 52 (2020), the Supreme Court ruled that holding a prisoner in a cell covered in feces even for just a few days violated clearly established Eighth Amendment rights, such that money damages were available.\n\nOvercrowding: Although overcrowding is one of the most common problems in U.S. prisons, it is not considered unconstitutional on its own. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981); C.H. v. Sullivan, 920 F.2d 483 (8th Cir. 1990). However, overcrowding is unconstitutional when it leads to other problems. The Supreme Court struck down overcrowding in California’s prisons in Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011). The prisons were at 200% of design capacity and this led to the prison system’s inability to provide medical and mental health care, dozens of sick prisoners held together awaiting medical treatment, and preventable deaths occurring once per week on average. If you wish to challenge overcrowding, you must show that it has caused a serious deprivation of basic human needs such as food, safety, or sanitation. French v. Owens, 777 F.2d 1250 (7th Cir. 1985); Toussaint v. Yockey, 722 F.2d 1490 (9th Cir. 1984).\n\nRehabilitative Programs: In general, prisons are not required to provide counseling services like drug or alcohol rehabilitation to prisoners unless they are juveniles, mentally ill, or received rehabilitative services as part of their sentence. Women Prisoners of District of Columbia Dept. of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nSolitary Confinement: Although the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether long-term solitary confinement violates the Eighth Amendment, the Court has stated that the duration of solitary confinement “cannot be ignored in deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional standards.” Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686 (1978). The Supreme Court has also said that the standards of “human dignity” set by the Eighth Amendment are not fixed but should evolve and “acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by humane justice.” Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701, 708 (2014). In non-binding opinions, Justice Anthony Kennedy has said, “[y]ears on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.” Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2210 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Stephen Breyer has said, “it is well documented that . . . prolonged solitary confinement produces numerous deleterious harms.” Glossip v. Gross, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2765 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Finally, Justice Sonia Sotomayor has said, “we do know that solitary confinement imprints on those it clutches a wide range of psychological scars.” Apodaca v. Raemisch, 139 S. Ct. 5 (2018) (Sotomayor, J. concurring in denial of certiorari). These quotes are not binding because they were not from the court’s main opinions, but they are still helpful to mention.\n\nOther federal courts have been willing to rule that solitary confinement violates the Eighth Amendment when it lasts a long time. In Young v. Martin, 801 F.3d 172 n. 8 (3rd Cir. 2015), an appeals court said that six-year solitary confinement “raises serious concerns under the Eighth Amendment’s conditions of confinement test.” In Johnson v. Wetzel, 209 F. Supp. 3d 766 (M.D. Pa. 2016), the court ordered that a plaintiff be moved out of solitary confinement and into the general population because long-term solitary confinement was likely a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. In Porter v. Clarke, 290 F. Supp. 3d 518, 530-31 (E.D. Va. 2018), the court found that plaintiffs kept in prolonged solitary confinement on death row had a valid Eighth Amendment claim because “prolonged isolation and lack of stimulation can have devastating psychological and emotional consequences,” and that “it would defy logic to suggest that [defendants] were unaware of the potential harm that lack of human interaction on death row could cause.” The court stated that because of the Eighth Amendment’s incorporation of contemporary standards of decency and the “rapidly evolving information available about the potential harmful effects of solitary confinement,” it was not bound by old court decisions denying Eighth Amendment claims.\n\nIn another important case, Ashker v. Brown, No. C 09-5796 CW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51148 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2013), ten prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison in California brought a class action challenging decades in solitary confinement. The plaintiffs complained of prolonged isolation, lack of stimuli, and serious psychological pain and suffering. The officials were put on notice because of administrative grievances, written complaints, and hunger strikes. The court allowed the Eighth Amendment claim to go forward, and the case ultimately settled after the state agreed to end indefinite solitary confinement in California. The judge referred to the agreement as both innovative and humane.\n\nSolitary confinement can also violate the Eighth Amendment if you can show it has harmed your physical or mental health. In Jones El v. Burge, 164 F. Supp. 2d 1096 (W.D. Wisc. 2001), the court found that that constant isolation, illumination, and other sensory deprivation for prisoners with serious mental health issues violates the Eighth Amendment. In cases where this argument failed, the prisoners were not able to prove the subjective element—that the prison knew the conditions were making their mental illness worse. Scarver v. Litscher, 434 F.3d 972 (7th Cir. 2006).\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has acknowledged that solitary confinement causes harm. In a 2014 report, the DOJ stated that long-term use of solitary confinement on mentally ill prisoners “violate[s] the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against ‘cruel and unusual punishments.’” DOJ Investigation of the Pa. Dep't of Corr. Use of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness and/or Intellectual Disabilities, which can be accessed on the internet at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2014/02/25/pdoc_finding_2-24-14.pdf. In a 2016 report, the DOJ recommended that incarcerated people be housed in the “least restrictive setting necessary” to ensure their safety, and that stated juveniles, women who are pregnant or post-partum, and people with serious mental illness not be placed in solitary confinement at all. DOJ U.S. Department of Justice Report and Recommendations Concerning the Use of Restrictive Housing (Jan. 2016), https://www.justice.gov/archives/dag/file/815551/download. While both the 2014 and 2016 reports are non-binding, they contain powerful statements from the DOJ.\n\nOther Conditions: Prisoners have also successfully challenged problems with lighting and fire safety, Hoptowit v. Spellman, 753 F.2d 779 (9th Cir. 1985); sleep deprivation, Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 2013); furnishings, Brown v. Bargery, 207 F.3d 863 (6th Cir. 2000); accommodation of physical disabilities, Bradley v. Puckett, 157 F.3d 1022 (5th Cir. 1998); unsafe work requirements, Fruit v. Norris, 905 F.2d 1147 (8th Cir. 1990); as well as other inadequate or inhumane conditions.\n\nInstead of challenging a particular condition, you may also bring an Eighth Amendment suit on a “totality of the conditions” theory. You can do this on your own or as part of a class action lawsuit. Using this theory, you can argue that even though certain conditions might not be unconstitutional on their own, they add up to create an overall effect that is unconstitutional. Palmer v. Johnson, 193 F.3d 346 (5th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court has limited this argument to cases where multiple conditions add up to create a single, identifiable harm, Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991), but the courts disagree on exactly what that means.\n\n4. Your Right to Medical Care\n\nP The Rule Prison officials may not act with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.\n\nWhat that means in practice is that the prison must provide you with medical care if you need it, but the Eighth Amendment does not protect you from medical malpractice.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment protects your right to get medical care. The Constitution guarantees prisoners this right, even though it does not guarantee medical care to people outside of prison. The Supreme Court explained that this is because “[a]n inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976). Unfortunately, the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee you the same level of medical care you might choose if you were not in prison.\n\nIf you feel that your right to adequate medical care has been violated, the Constitution is not the only source of your legal rights. You can bring claims under your state constitution or state statutes relating to medical care or the treatment of prisoners. You can also bring a medical malpractice suit in state court. If you are a federal prisoner, you might also bring a claim in federal court under the Federal Tort Claims Act. However, this section will focus exclusively on your right to medical care under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo succeed in an Eighth Amendment challenge to the medical care in your prison, you must show three things. These are:\n\n1. You had a serious medical need;\n\n2. Prison officials showed “deliberate indifference” to your serious medical need; and\n\n3. This deliberate indifference caused your injury.\n\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). These requirements are described in more detail below.\n\na. Serious Medical Need\n\nUnder the Eighth Amendment, you are entitled to medical care for “serious medical needs.” Serious medical needs can relate to “physical, dental, and mental health.” Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757, 785 (9th Cir. 2019).\n\nSome courts describe a serious medical need as “one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a layperson would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.” Hill v. Dekalb Reg'l Youth Det. Ctr., 40 F.3d 1176, 1187 (11th Cir. 1994); Youmans v. Gagnon, 626 F.3d 557 (11th Cir. 2010). Courts usually agree that a prisoner can show a serious medical need if the “failure to treat a prisoner’s condition could result in further significant injury or the ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.’” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976); Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006). In other words, if a doctor says you need treatment, or your need is obvious, then it is probably a “serious medical need.”\n\nCourts generally agree that the existence of a serious medical need depends on the facts surrounding each person. Smith v. Carpenter, 316 F.3d 178 (2d Cir. 2003). A condition may not be a serious medical need in one situation but could be a serious medical need in another. Chronic conditions like diabetes, HIV, AIDS, hepatitis, epilepsy, and hypertension are serious medical needs, for which you deserve medical attention and care. Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir. 2004) is a nice example of a court deciding that HIV and hepatitis are serious medical needs.\n\nIn considering whether you have a serious medical need, the court will look at several factors, including:\n\nWhether a reasonable doctor or patient would consider the need worthy of comment or treatment;\n\nWhether the condition significantly affects daily activities; and\n\nWhether you have chronic and serious pain.\n\nFor more on these factors, a good case to read is Brock v. Wright, 315 F.3d 158 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\nThe right to adequate medical care also includes “a right to psychiatric and mental health care, and a right to be protected from self-inflicted injuries, including suicide.” Belcher v. City of Foley, Ala., 30 F.3d 1390, 1396 (11th Cir. 1994). Other decisions recognizing the right to mental health care include Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002), Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, 439 F.3d 280, 292 (6th Cir. 2006) and Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\nSeveral courts have held that a risk of suicide is a serious medical need for the purposes of the Eighth Amendment. Estate of Cole by Pardue v. Fromm, 94 F.3d 254 (7th Cir. 1996); Gregoire v. Class, 236 F.3d 413 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\nIt is important that you keep detailed records of your condition and inform prison medical staff of exactly how you are suffering.\n\nb. Deliberate Indifference\n\nTo satisfy the “subjective” portion of the Eighth Amendment standard, you must show that prison officials treated you with deliberate indifference. This means, (1) prison officials knew about your serious medical need, and (2) the prison officials failed to respond reasonably to it. Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104; Gutierrez v. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nTo show that prison officials knew about your medical needs, you will need to describe all the ways you tried to notify prison officials about your medical condition and treatment needs, by submitting grievances and medical requests. This means that any time you experience a serious medical issue, you should keep careful records of your efforts. You should take advantage of sick-call procedures at your prison and report your condition even if you do not think officials will help you. You should keep notes of the dates that you requested medical assistance and the identification of the prison officials. You should describe the medical complaint that you had and the effect that any delays had on your health. You should include these details in your formal grievances and complaints.\n\nPrison officials who know about your serious medical needs must provide treatment “at a level reasonably commensurate with modern medical science and of a quality acceptable within prudent professional standards.” United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1987). This means that treatment decisions are unconstitutional and inadequate when they are “far afield of accepted professional standards.” Arnett v. Webster, 658 F.3d 742, 751 (7th Cir. 2011).\n\nCourts most often find deliberate indifference when:\n\nA prison doctor fails to respond appropriately or does not respond at all to your serious medical needs. Scott v. Ambani, 577 F.3d 642 (6th Cir 2009); Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2004); Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d 845 (8th Cir. 2002).\n\nPrison doctors or officials delay or deny giving you medically necessary mental, medical, or dental care, or a medical diet. Grieveson v. Anderson, 538 F.3d 763, 779 (7th Cir.2008) (1.5 day delay in treating broken nose); Smith v. Knox Cnty. Jail, 666 F.3d 1037 (7th Cir. 2012) (5 day delay providing emergency medical care); Brown v. District of Columbia, 514 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (2 month delay on medical care); Harrison v. Barkley, 219 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2000) (one year delay for dental care); Byrd v. Wilson, 701 F.2d 592 (6th Cir. 2013) (medical diet).\n\nPrisons adopt policies that restrict access to medical treatment on a blanket basis, regardless of individual need. Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843 (7th Cir. 2011), Johnson v. Wright, 412 F.3d 398 (2d Cir. 2005);\n\nWhen non-medical officials interfere with the treatment that your doctor has ordered. Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05; Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir 2000).\n\nThe easiest cases to win are cases where you are completely denied medical treatment, but you can also bring an Eighth Amendment claim saying treatment you are currently receiving is inadequate. Here, one good case to cite is Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1985), which stated “medical care . . . so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all may violate the [Eighth] Amendment.” Another is Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir. 1998), which stated that a prison official or medical practitioner “may be deliberately indifferent if he or she consciously chooses ‘an easier and less efficacious’ treatment plan.”\n\nPrisons cannot deny you medical treatment just because it is new or expensive, like Hepatitis C treatment or complex surgeries. Allah v. Thomas, 679 F. App’x 216, 220–21 (3d Cir. 2017) and Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843 (7th Cir. 2011) are two good cases about the right to Hepatitis C treatment even though it is expensive. And in Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., 935 F.3d 757 (9th Cir. 2019) a court ruled that a transgender prisoner was entitled to gender-confirmation surgery, regardless of cost.\n\nAlthough prison officials generally can rely on the treatment recommendations that prison doctors give them, prison officials can still be held liable for denying you treatment if the need would be obvious to anyone. For example, in McRaven v. Sanders, 577 F.3d 974 (8th Cir. 2009) a court found that prison officials could not deny hospitalization to an unconscious person who overdosed just because a nurse recommended against it.\n\nUnfortunately, courts do not usually require prison medical staff to give you the best possible care. For example, one court did not find a violation when prison medical staff followed the doctor’s orders about what to do with a prisoner who had been beaten. Even though the prisoner complained several times and the prisoner’s condition was more serious than the doctor had recognized, there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment. Perkins v. Lawson, 312 F.3d 872 (7th Cir. 2002). Another court found that there was not deliberate indifference in a case where a patient received thirteen medical examinations in one year, even though he claimed that a muscular condition in his back did not improve. Jones v. Norris, 310 F.3d 610 (8th Cir. 2002). Even if there is a delay in treatment, you may still need to show that the doctor knew better. In Whiting v. Wexford Health Sources, Inc., 839 F.3d 658 (7th Cir. 2016), the court found no deliberate indifference when a doctor tried to treat a prisoner’s undiagnosed cancer with antibiotics, saying instead that the doctor’s approach was reasonable.\n\nc. Causation\n\nYou must show that you suffered some harm or injury as a result of the prison official’s deliberate indifference. If officials failed to respond to your complaints about serious pain but the pain went away on its own, you will not succeed in a constitutional challenge. For example, courts have said that short interruptions of otherwise adequate treatment of serious conditions like epilepsy and arthritis may not violate the Eighth Amendment. Bilal v. White, 494 Fed. Appx. 143 (2d Cir. 2012).\n\nIn some situations, you may wish to challenge your prison’s medical care system as a whole and not just the care or lack of care that you received in response to a particular medical need. These systemic challenges to prison medical care systems are also governed by the deliberate indifference standard. For example, in Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014), Arizona prisoners brought a class action challenging terrible medical, mental, and dental health care provided by a private company operating in the prisons. The case eventually settled for important changes. Successful cases have also challenged the medical screening procedures for new prisoners, the screening policies or staffing for prisoners seeking care, and the disease control policies of prisons. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978).\n\nRemember, you cannot bring an Eighth Amendment challenge to medical care just because it was negligent (such as if a doctor tries to help you but accidentally makes you worse) or because you disagree with the type of treatment a doctor gave you. You might be able to bring those sorts of claims through other means, such as state medical malpractice laws.\n\nd. The COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nMany people in prison and detention have sought release from prison based on the risk to their health posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Martinez-Brooks v. Easter, 459 F. Supp. 3d 411 (D. Ct. 2020), people in Danbury federal prison in Connecticut filed a class action Habeas lawsuit to challenge the prison’s failure to adequately protect them from catching the virus under the Eighth Amendment. A “Habeas” lawsuit is different from a 1983 or Bivens action in that it allows a prisoner to ask for release from prison as a form of relief. In the Danbury case, the prisoners first got a temporary restraining order from the judge, ordering the warden to identify medically vulnerable prisoners and create standards for release to home confinement. Temporary restraining orders are described in chapter four. The case settled a few months later, creating a process for court review of decisions about home confinement for all medically vulnerable prisoners.\n\nSome federal prisoners have also succeeded in filing individual cases for compassionate release based on medical vulnerability to COVID-19. One example is United States v. Young, 460 F. Supp. 3d. 71 (D. Ma. 2020). Not all COVID-19 cases are about release. In Seth v. McDonough, 461 F.Supp.3d 242 (D. Md. 2020), a class of men detained in a county correctional facility won injunctive relief forcing the jail to improve COVID-19 precautions, like testing, protective equipment, and cleaning.\n\nMany cases have been less successful, however, and as this handbook goes to print, this is a quickly changing area of law with a lot of procedural complications. So if you are considering a COVID-19 related case, you will want to read as many cases as you can find in your circuit and district to figure out your best chance of success.\n\nb. Job/Program Discrimination\n\nIf you think you were denied or removed from a prison job or program because you are LGBTQ+, you may be able to bring an equal protection claim. Although it arose outside the prison context, a good case to cite is the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), which found that discrimination against LGBTQ+ workers is unlawful sex discrimination.\n\nEven prior to Bostock, courts have found that equal protection claims brought by LGBTQ+ people denied prison jobs and program participation may succeed. In Davis v. Prison Health Services, 679 F.3d 433 (6th Cir. 2012), Johnson v. Knable, 1988 WL 119136 (4th Cir. 1988), and Counce v. Kemma, 2005 WL 579588 (W.D. Mo. 2005), courts ruled that LGBTQ+ plaintiffs who were denied prison work assignment because of their sexual orientation had a valid equal protection claim. In Holmes v. Artuz, No. 95 Civ. 2309 (SS), 1995 WL 634995 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 1995), the Court also rejected a policy denying mess hall jobs to “overt homosexual[s]” on equal protection grounds, writing: “A person’s sexual orientation, standing alone, does not reasonably, rationally or self-evidently implicate…security concerns.” The Court also rejected the argument that the employment ban was necessary to prevent “potential disciplinary and security problems” among prisoners biased against LGBTQ+ people.\n\nIn McKibben v McMahon, 2015 WL 10382396 (C.D. Cal. 2015), LGBTQ+ prisoners successfully brought a class action challenging their denial of educational opportunities, including occupational training and GED classes, and drug rehab programs.\n\nTo prevail on your equal protection claim, you will have to show an actual injury, such as attempting to participate in a program and being denied. In Bass v. Santa Clara Dept. of Corrections Sup’rs, 1994 WL 618554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 27, 1994), the court rejected a case brought by nine LGBTQ+ prisoners who alleged they were barred from participating in prison programs but had never actually tried to join and been denied.\n\nDue process claims challenging the denial of a job or program are unlikely to succeed because prisoners do not have a constitutionally protected interest in their prison jobs.\n\nHowever, if being denied access to prison programs is preventing you from earning good time credits that could lead to an early release, you can try to argue your due process rights are being violated because of your liberty interest in earning a reduced sentence. A good case to cite is the Supreme Court’s decision in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), which found that prisoners have a liberty interest in good time credits, so due process applies. Be aware though, when considering whether a prisoner has a liberty interest in the opportunity to earn good time credit, the law differs from state to state and depends on the nature of the state’s good time credit regulations. For example, in Stine v. Fox, 731 Fed.Appx. 767 (10th Cir. 2018), a court held there was no liberty interest in unearned good time credit in the Bureau of Prisons. Similarly, in Abed v. Armstrong, 209 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2000), a court held"
