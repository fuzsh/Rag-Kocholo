A number of frame buildings were destroyed, the loss amounting to about $10,000, probably two-thirds of which will be made good by insurance. One man slipped and fell from the roof of a two story building, striking on his head and shoulder, sustaining but little injury. While this fire seems to have been quite a blow to the town, undoubtedly it will ultimately prove a benefit, as better and more substantial buildings will be erected in their stead.\n\nThe Iowa Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 25 December 1891; page 9, column 1-2\n\nTOWN MEETINGS--THEIR POWER.\n\nIowa county has had a veritable town meeting. It called into its august presence the Board of Supervisors and catechized them in regard to the manner they were discharging their duties in reference to the bridge building. The County Farmers' Alliance called the meeting at Williamsburgh. The members of the Board of Supervisors were present. A public hearing was had. They were asked to explain why they did not let the contract for building bridges to the lowest responsible bidder, etc., etc. Jayne & Son, of this city, were present. Roller & Co., the firm which has been building bridges for the county, were also present. After hearing all parties, the following resolutions were adopted:\n\nResolved--That after hearing the views of Jayne & Son, Roller & Co. and the Board of Supervisors on the Iowa county bridge question, we favor, in the future, the publication of the letting of the contract for building our bridges yearly, in order that we may obtain the very best work for the least money.\n\nWe view with disfavor the former action of the Board of Supervisors in regard to the matter, and consider their explanation of their action unsatisfactory.\n\nPublished by order of County Alliance.\n\nN. D. ELY, Secretary.\n\nThis appears to be a point scored for Jayne & Son, who have complained that the letting of the bridge contracts was privately done and no opportunity was afforded for competition. but in regard to the merits of the controversy we have examined it sufficiently to speak. It is the novelty of the affair to which we wish to call attention. It is a capital idea--summoning the public servants before the people who chose them and obtain an account of their stewardship. We like it. In England and most of the European countries questions can be put to the ministers of the government in the Parliaments, courts or Reichstadt, but in America we have nothing like it except the \"town meeting.\" If there were more of such meetings it would be better for the people, and the public officers who spend the people's money, if frequently brought face to face with the people who elect them and whose money is spent, would feel their personal responsibility to a greater degree. It would be more fun than a dozen circuses to see the Johnson county Board of Supervisors appear before such a town meeting and submit to an examination as to the manner in which they have discharged their duties. Let thee be more of such meetings. The Iowa county Farmers' Alliance is on the right track.\n\nThe Iowa Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 1 January 1892; page 11, column 2\n\nThe special election, held in Iowa county last Tuesday, was a very close affair. the proposition to sell certain lands in Ida and Cherokee counties, belonging to Iowa county, and with a part of the proceeds build a new court house, was submitted to the vote of the people. The vote stood 1957 yes, and 1231 no. Marengo is at present the county seat, and the people of Williamsburg have been working for a long time to have it changed to their town. The building of a new court house in Marengo settles the question, for the time being at least. The people in Williamsburg and vicinity have been fighting the proposition for all there was in it, and the result of their labors is seen by the vote.\n\nThe Iowa Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 15 April 1892; page 5 of 8, column 4\n\nTHE ONLY LOAD IN THE GUN.\n\nLast Sundwy [sic] morning Harry E. Kelly, son of Senator Kelly, of Williamsburg, Iowa county, was accidentally shot. He and his room mate were examining a 32 calibre revolver. When in the hands of tbe room mate the weapon went off and the bullet struck Mr. Kelly in the angle of the mouth, passed through the cheek, and plowed along the roots of the teeth in the upper jaw, knocking out five or six teeth, cutting a deep furrow in the tongue. The revolver was so near that the face was burned by the powder to some extent.\n\nThe accident, while quite painful, will not prove serious. Mr. Kelly is having no fever and expects to be out on Saturday. There was only one load in the revolver and that was the one the hammer fell upon the first time.\n\nThe Iowa Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 22 April 1892; page 3 of 18, column 2\n\nTHE CITY.\n\n...

An entrance to the building had been affected at the rear door, and the robbers proceeded to blow the vault door open. That their attempt was only too successful is evidenced by the fact that the explosion was so great as to awaken half the inhabitants of the town, and in five minutes the streets were alive with people, in possession of everything from a lantern to a breechloader, in quest of the fleeing robbers. As soon as the explosion occured [sic] the trespassers realized their danger and quickly disappeared in the darkness. The next morning they were tracked as far as Carnforth[?] where all clues as to their whereabouts was lost. They did not secure anything in the way of cash, but the vault is almost a total wreck.\n\n-------------\n\n\"The Danicheffs.\"\n\n-------------\n\nCharles Crow is a farmer and owner of a fine residence, five miles south of Oxford. Last Friday a smooth-tongued scamp came along persuading the farmer to give him an order for a rod, to cost $6.50. Then the order men disappeared and a gang of workmen came and began putting up the rod. Crow went to his brother near by who, armed with a Winchester and navy revolver, compelled the lightening rod swindlers to take down their rods and get out. Crow then chased down the man who had his order and it had grown to the amount of $106.50. The order was torn up.--Williamsburg Journal\n\nDaily Iowa State Press, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Tuesday, 4 April 1899; page 5 of 8\n\n[column 2]\n\nLocal News.\n\n---\n\n... D. H.

Ferson of Frendale one of the most enthusiastic promoters of the rural electric line which it proposed to be built from Iowa City to Williamsburg is in the city today talking of the project with several business men.\n\nMr. Ferson reports that committees have been working during the past few months and have secured about $5,000 in subscription from farmers living within a radius of four or five miles near Windham. Beyond this distance nothing has been done and Mr. Person is confident that much more money will be subscribed by the citizens of Iowa City and Williamsburg. During the next few months a canvass for funds will be made all along the proposed line which will be about thirty miles in length.\n\nThe proposed road follows Old Man's Creek bottom and connects Iowa City and Williamsburg having direct connections with Unity, Windham, Holbrook and Frendale. The promoters desire to have the road constructed this year if possible and will make every effort to accomplish their purpose. The new road if built will be used for both freight and passenger service and will fill a long felt want.\n\nThe country tributary to it is rich in fertility of soil and natural resources. Along Old Man's creek bottom are hundreds of acres of timber from which much timber and wood could be cut. The long haul to market and the great cost of the same has left the industry practically undeveloped and should the new road be constructed it would not be many months until the forests would be invaded with the axe and saw mill.\n\nToday Mr. Ferson received a letter from George M. Kepner of Fort Dodge a practical railroad builder who will probably take hold of the project.

J. Williams is visiting the English Isles. The letter follows and will be of interest to the friends of these gentlemen about Iowa City:\n\nHefferman's Hotel,\n\nKillarney, Ireland, July 13, 1909\n\nEditors Journal-Tribune,\n\nWilliamsburg, Iowa, U. S. A.\n\nDear Friends:--\n\nWe arrived in old and beautiful Killarney today, left Wales last night and arrived at Rosslare, Ireland, and left at once for this city. The distance is 200 miles and our course lay through as fine and pretty a farming country as I ever saw. Neat farm houses with thatched rooffs [sic] and white-washed walls that blend artistically with neatly trimmed hedges and pastures greener than the greenest green that ever covered an Iowa meadow in June. The pastures were well stocked with large Shropshire sheep and plenty of horses, cattle and donkeys. But we missed the hogs, the great mortgage lifter for the Iowa farmer is not in evidence in Ireland, at least the hog is not seen in such herds as one sees on the farms around Williamsburg. The trip on the railroad was one continuous panorama of scenes both pleasing and restful to the sight and mind. Country roads stretch out like white ribbons joining village after village and threading the rural sections in graceful sweeps and curves.\n\nKillarney is a beautiful city of 5000 inhabitants. It has fine, substantial buildings, large and well-kept churches, hotels, etc. The lakes and drives here are noted the whole world over, and when one says the nicest things about them that language will permit the half has not been told of the wondrously witching beauty of the place. The lakes are not lakes but fairy dreams shimmering and glistening in the light of a mellow sun or sparkling in the pale, white glow of the moon that well might envy a beauty that surpasses the subtle charm of witchery. The resorts here are splendid and crowded all the time. American tourists are here in large numbers and you may have read of the drowning of thirteen people in one of the lakes. Seven Americans were among the lost. The women in the party became nervous and excited and held to the boatmen with such grips that they could not manage the craft; but I will tell you more about the lakes when I come home.\n\nWe have been on the go ever since we left on the 9th of June. We have been in nearly every town of any importance in South Wales and in many parts of England. We spent four days in London, two days sight-seeing and two days at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.\n\nWe made our home at Cilgovin farm with my aunt and cousins and went to different places from there. We spent ten days with the boys of Mountain Ash and the visit was one continual round of pleasure in which every meal was a banquet and every reception a royal welcome. The Mountain Ash boys all remembered Williamsburg and did all that they could to make our stay among them a pleasant one. They want to see America once more and above all they want to visit Williamsburg.\n\nWe leave here tomorrow for North Wales to spend a little time with our shipmate, W. L. Williams, and from there we will go to Liverpool. On July 31st, we will sail for home on the Baltic as we are all anxious to see our families and friends in dear old Williamsburg.\n\nOn Tuesday last we went to Barry Docks to visit Mr. and Mrs. L. D. Jones. We found them sitting on the beach and they are looking and feeling fine. Mr. Jones is longing to see his old home but they will remain until September.\n\nIf the junior editor of the J.-T. could see the fine lot of Irish girls around old Killarney we are sure he would renounce his folly and at once leave off his clinging hold on the cheerless form of bachelorhood. God was good to Ireland. He gave her the richest green for her fields and forests, the softest blue for her summer skies, the clearest water for her babbling brooks, the best nature for her men and dowered her women with a wealth of beauty such as you seldom see. And if Gallagher could only meet these dark-haired, blue-eyed coleens we are sure that his hard heart would soften into song--and stay soft during the remainder of his days.\n\nWell, a rig is waiting to take us to another lake and I must close. Please give my kind regards to all the pople [sic] of Williamsburg and vicinity. We expect to be home about August 15th.\n\nYour Friend,\n\nHOWELL WILLIAMS\n\nThe Iowa Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Monday, 13 September 1909; page 5, column 2\n\n...The City...\n\n...

G. Williams and\n\nDaughter Return From Trip\n\n-------\n\nWilliamsburg Journal: Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Williams and daughter returned last week from their trip to Wales. They were accompanied by Mrs. W. O. Edwards of York who made the round trip with them but who spent nearly all her time with relatives in Ireland.\n\nThe Journal-Tribune scribe met Mr. Williams and learned from the interview that they had a very pleasant journey. Seasickness annoyed the party but little and on the whole the trip was a delightful one. the weather in Wales was generally cold and wet and Williams liked this part of it not well. Then, too, he had a hard time trying to convince the doubting Welshmen of the truth of the big things he told them concerning this great country. They thought he was simply boasting. On one or two occasions Williams convinced them of the truth of his assertions by showing them copies of the Journal-Tribune which he regularly received in his absence.\n\nThe country is poor, the people are poor, the landlord gets about everything the people raise beyond what will keep them. The better the farms are improved the more rent one must pay, although the landlord's taxes are not increased on this account. The attempt to tax the land will remedy this to a great extent and will place a good portion of the burden on the backs of the land owners. No more burden can be placed on the tenant class, it is now carrying all it can posibly [sic] bear. Mr. Williams learned many things about old country conditions. He saw Armour's meat in the sops selling for less than what they cost in Williamsburg, and the same was true of flour from the great mills of Minneapolis. the whole land over there simply lives on this country--it would starve to death if the supply from here was cut off or interrupted from any great length of time. Mr. Williams was born in America and the things he learned over there made him prouder than ever of the land of his birth.\n\nMrs. Williams was born in Wales and her visit revived many of the associations of her girlhood. She saw the old home of her fathers and it is yet held by her relatives. For three hundred years the Edwards family has resided on this land, ten generations have paid tribute to the landlord system and the present tenant is no richer than the first.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Wednesday, 17 November 1909; page 8 of 8, column 5\n\n...The City...\n\n...

J. T. Jones of this city acted as master of ceremonies on Thanksgiving day, tells in detail of the prizes won by the Williamsburg singers. After commending Rev. Jones for his efficient services and speaking of the monster crowds which heard the programs, the despatch says:\n\nWilliamsburg Winners.\n\n\" The choral society of the town of Williamsburg, near Cedar Rapids, carried off a big per cent of the honors, winning ail of the principal competitions. Over $410 was their share of the prize money. Their chorus, which numbered fifty-eight matured voices, rendered beautiful music, and hard work in the rehearsals was shown. The Williamsburg chorus was under the leadership of Professor Lloyd, and the winning of the four chief contests and the four gold medals for the conductor, when placed on the little director, nearly covered the front of his coat. The Williamsburg chorus was highly complimented by Adjudicator Davies for their excellent renditions. The members of the chorus could not hold their enthusiasm last night, following the winning of the chief choral competition and their yells filled the air when Prof. Davies delivered his adjudication at the close of the eisteddfod.\n\n\"The Ottumwa Choral society won second in the choral competition. The Ottumwa ladies' quartet captured first honors in the quartet class and Miss Blanche Bissell of Ottumwa was awarded first prize in the soprano solo competition.\n\nHiteman and Albia.\n\n\"Hiteman and Albia people took an active part in the eisteddfod and next to Williamsburg and Ottumwa the Albia people carried away a big share of the other prizes. Hiteman was also represented in the prize money. Miss Helen Miltenberger of Albia who took a prominent part in the afternoon program, was the recipient of many beautiful compliments by Adjudicator Davies.\"\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Monday, 13 December 1909; page 6 of 8, column 4\n\nWilliamsburg Journal: At the recent meeting of the National Horticultural Congress in Council Bluffs, the combined fruit exhibit of F. O. Harrington of Williamsburg, J. W. Murphy of Glenwood and B. Stuart of Des Moines was awarded the $500 silver trophy as the championship prize for the United States. Besides the grand trophy there were many minor prizes, though representing considerable worth.\n\nThis is the second consecutive time that Messrs Harrington, Murphy and Stuart won the championship in the national meeting of fruit growers and this fact argues that Iowa has the soil and the climate to produce fine fruit as well as fine corn.\n\nIn this meeting the display of apples from the Harrington farm was conceded to be the finest in the entire building, yet there were apples from Idaho, Oregon and Washington, districts upon which fortunes have been spent in advertising the apple growing industry. Missouri has been known as the \"home of the big red apple,\" yet her fruit was far surpassed by the fruit grown right here in York township, Iowa county, Iowa.\n\nMessrs. Harrington, Murphy and Stuart have performed a meritorious service for Iowa. They have twice demonstrated to the whole country that the old Hawkeye state can grow the best fruit in the world.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Tuesday, 13 June 1911; page 1 of 8, columns 3-5\n\nALUMNI HERE\n\nIN NUMBERS\n\nFOR REUNION\n\n----\n\nOLD GRADUATES OF THE UNI-\n\nVERSITY IN CITY FROM ALL\n\nPARTS OF U.

Corey, one of the ablest young men that ever won honors at Iowa university, committed suicide in his room, in the Rogers hotel, Minneapolis, by shooting himself in the head, Friday night.\n\nCountless friends in Iowa City will grieve.\n\n*Funeral in Iowa City.*\n\nThe remains were brought hither to day, and the funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock, from the Methodist church.\n\nRev. S. E. Ellis, the pastor, will be assisted by Rev. Mr. Trimble, of Mt. Auburn, Ia., an old friend of the Corey family.\n\nThe terrible truth was not known until late Saturday afternoon, and the sad news was telegraphed here at once.\n\n*Leaves Trenchant Note.*\n\nA trenchant note, left by the young man, tells the whole story of his mental distress--terribly uncalled for, but due to obsessions that have afflicted him, ever since his health broke down in 1913--and it explains his rash act fully.\n\n*Coroner Has Sad Missive.*\n\nCoroner Gilbert Seashore has the sad missive, which was found in Corey's notebook.\n\nIt Read as follows:\n\n********************************** * * * \"Constant brooding over ill * * health that now makes me use- * * less, and which, I know, will * * eventually kill me, prompts me * * to do this. * * \"I am doomed. * * \"To those who call me cow- * * ard, I say that the good and * * merciful God who knows all * * things cannot deny me forgive- * * ness.\" * * * **********************************\n\n*Iowa City People Mourn.*\n\nIowa City people will mourn deeply the awful state of the young attorney.\n\nHe was widely-known throughout the community, and his great gifts--closely allied to genius; his capacity for an immense amount of work; his accomplishments, as a scholar, orator, and professional and business man; as well as his personality, which was unusually pleasing and winning-- had won him friends on every side.\n\nHis life was one that promised a brilliant career, when he left college.\n\nNo young man who ever earned university of Iowa degrees was ever entitled to look with more eagerness and with greater anticipation of success upon life. His career seemed assured--and everyone who knew him predicted victory in every battle of business and profession that awaited him. No one could forecast, last June, that so cruel a tragedy was destined to cut short his life in its very bloom.\n\nHe was only 26 years of age, his 27th birthday coming March, 27, 1914\n\n*Sympathy for Family.*\n\nThe entire community will sympathie [sic] with the Corey family. The grief stricken parents are nearly prostrated. They were wrapped up in their talented son, and justly so. They will be shaken and broken by his sad fate. A host of friends will tender their deep and sincere sympathy. their bereavement seems unbearable, but kindly well-wishers will pray that they may find consolation, even when seemingly inconsolable.\n\n*Warning of Tragedy.*\n\nThe tragedy, in a sense, had cast its shadow before.\n\nWhile Chester was in excellent health and in good spirits, seemingly, when he left Iowa City on ihs [sic] fatal trip, yet his closest acquaintances and personal friends had had warning that the deadly purpose had lurked in his mind in other days.\n\nThus, although inexpressibly shocked, there are near friends who do not find the terrible event entirely unexpected.\n\nCorey has been despondent, off and on, for months, having been under a shadow ever since he was a victim om [sic] nervous prostration in Canada, last summer.\n\n*Seemed to Recover.*\n\nHis father, D. W. Corey, a grocer of Iiwa City [sic], sent a skilled physician to Canada at the time, and Chester, seemingly quite recovered, was finally brought home by the doctor. The young man, however, brooded a deal oevr [sic] his condition, and expressed a fear that his mental and physical condition might never be the same aagin. [sic]\n\n*Threatened to do Deed*\n\nHe even threatened to take his won life in moments of depest [sic] gloom, but warm friends, \"talked him out\" of that thought--or at least, induced him for the time being, to forego any such desperate intentions.\n\nIn later months, here, the young attorney--who was not practicing here, having been engaged in the law and real estate business in Canada, instead--had seemingly recovered his health and strength, mentally and physically, entirely, and only his closest associates knew he was still brooding.\n\n*Worried over Marriage*\n\nHe was worried considerably over his anticipated marriage. He was engaged to a sweetheart of his old college days, Miss Irene Jones of Williamsburgh, and he often expressed the fear that he ought not to wed, unless he was much more wealthy. His worry over finances was without good grounds, however, as he was well equipped in that respect, though not wealthy, and lack of money would not have prevented him from claiming his bride, had his mind not erred. His postponed wedding and his business future became obsessions with him, however, and he talked incessantly of his troubles-- all imaginary in realty.\n\n*Woud End Betrothal* [sic]\n\nHe even expressed a willingness to break off his betrothal, if the young woman to whom he was engaged saw fit, if she feared he would not care for her properly. She was true and faithful, however, and declined to let the brooding of her fiance influence her to such a step.\n\n*Leaves for North*\n\nA fortnight ago, Corey, with two good business openings, left for the north. He was not heard from during the past two weeks, save once, when he telephoned to his father, and it was supposed that he had gone to Canada-- until the tragic telegram from Minneapolis brought the steartling [sic] news here.\n\nHis failure to write since he went away, had led his nearest friends and kinsfolk to fear, however, that something had happended [sic] to him, and even that the very act which he had committed had been done. The message from the Flour City confirmed their worst fears.\n\nWhen Corey went away he was cheerful and even optomistic [sic], and predicted that either of his two business openings would prove a success. Evidentally [sic] he resumed his brooding when he reached Minseapolis [sic], and there settled down at the Rogers hotel, growing more and more despondent until he committed the rash act.\n\n*Brilliant Young Man*\n\nThe young attorney was a brilliant man. He was graduated from the University of Iowa College of Liberal Arts and law-- in 1910 and 1913 respectively. He was secretary of Prof. C. F. Ansley, dean of the English department, during his final year in college. He was unusually active in many fields, and yet, despite his outside activities, stood second in the law class with which he graduated. He was a debater and oraeor [sic] of note, and won second honors in the Northwestern oratorical league, in 1909. He was a member of the Acacia (Masonic) fraternity; the Sigma Delta Chi fraternity; the Delta Sigma Rho fraternity; the Order of the Coif; and the Zethagathion Literary society.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Saturday, 22 April 1916; page 2, column 4\n\nMOTOR SHOW IS\n\nTHE BEST EVER\n\n---\n\nHARRY DUNLAP SAYS HE HAS\n\nATTENDED ALL AND IOWA\n\nCITY LEADS\n\n---\n\n\"This is the best automobile show I have ever seen, everything considered, and I have attended them all,\" said H. . Dunlap, the Williamsburg auctioneer, while looking over the Iowa City automobile show.\n\n\"Of course,\" continued Mr. Dunlap \"there have been bigger shows than this, but for arrangement, convenience, appearance, and merit of the exhibits I think Iowa City has them all beaten. I had no idea the dealers here would put up such a fine exhibition.\n\nThe show closes tonight.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Wednesday, 14 June 1916; page 5, column 1-5\n\nMANY GRADUATE\n\nFROM UNIVERSITY\n\n----\n\nLONG LIST OF GRADUATES TOTALS\n\n431 THIK YEAR--LARG-\n\nEST IN HISTORY\n\n----\n\nA new record in numbers for the class which completed its course in the university this year was set by 1916 when degrees were conferred this morning upon 431 students at the annual commencement exercises.

Those who remained home did so very unwillingly.\n\nthe Oxford band came over Wednesday evening and gave us some good music and also advertised their Chautauqua.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Charles Ranson of Mason Clay and Ed Ranson of Eirne Illinois were in town a few hours Friday afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ranson visited at the Walter Durr home and Ed Ranson looked up a few of his friends he knew twenty-five years ago. It had been that long since he was in Williamsburg.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Howard Hughes and daughters Mrs. Novak and Mrs. Geo. Sundberg motored out from Chicago and spent Saturday and Sunday with relatives and old friends here.\n\nAmong the people who went to Blairstown Sunday to attend the funeral services for Mr. James Ranson, were Mr. and Mrs. Dixon Jones, Laura Seymour, Mrs. J.

The herd included six bulls, and the 39 head consisted of cows, heifers and calves.\n\nMr. Cash had this offering selected for a sale to have been held in Williamsburg the first week in October. Tudor & Son saw the offering, liked the choice Blackbirds and Trojan Ericas the herd contained, and they bought the entire lot. The price received at private sale would be equal to a much higher price at public sale, since the selling cost of a herd of cattle is an expensive proposition.\n\nMr. Cash has been in the Angus business for many years and his fine herd was widely known; he feels that he is entitled to that ease that comes with freedom from care and worry, so he disposed of his entire herd of cattle and will enjoy the bright and pleasant places that abound along the Easy Path.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 15 November 1918; page 11, columns 1-3\n\nBIG CELEBRATION\n\nAT WILLIAMSBURG\n\n-----\n\nWilliamsburg, Nov. 14.--The dispatches that Germany signed the armistice reached Williamsburg Monday morning a few minutes before five. It three the whole community into a paroxysm of joy. Whistles screeched, bells pealed forth in clamorous tones the great, glad news. Williamsburg was jubilant all day and far into the night. Engine whistles, church, school and even little hand and cow bells, auto horns and anything that would make an noise was brought into play to voice Williamsburg's joy at the cessation of hostilities between Germany and the allied armies. The business houses were closed all day.\n\nOne of the prettiest sights of the day, to the writer's thought was that of the boys in the early twilight dawn. The boys who play the coronets in the band got out in a clear open space and played \"The Star Spangled Banner\", and the clear, high notes in the early morning light was a realistic picture of the opening lines of the anthem as penned by the author.\n\nThere was a parade at 1:30 p.m. of the citizens of the town, headed by an auto truck in which a group of men were guarding the Kaiser in chains. The band was followed wherever it went by scores of men and boys. York township came into town in an auto pageant of seventy-five cars and were headed by a big box poster from Carl Holden's pencil showing a scene in Berlin, another of the kaiser weeping and yet another of Uncle Sam's smiling face.\n\nThe crowd gathered in the school yard and an appropriate patriot program was given. The platform was a flag decorated truck. Atty P. P. White presided at the meeting and gave a most appropriate talk. Rev. G. J. Schillerstrom spoke on the oft repeated [?]erman phrase \"Against that Day\". Congressman Harry E. Hull then spoke on his attitude toward conscription and his part in that committee's work in congress. The band disbursed music throughout the afternoon and the program of the afternoon closed with a prayer by Rev. Schillerstrom. In the evening an immense bonfire was lit in the school yard. Several trucks had been busy all day, each with its crew of volunteers. Visits were made to all the alleys in town and boxes, crates, barrels, boards and most anything inflammable were commandeered and carted down to the school yard. All thought of the carefully framed conservation rules of Dr. Garfield were for the time being forgotten. High up over the pile was the kaiser in effigy and his poor material frame was a good mark for the flames.\n\n-----\n\nWord was received here this week that Mack Thoneson, died at sea October 4 while on the way to France. The body was carried to the end of the journey and buried n foreign soil. He had come to Williamsburg from Virginia, his home, and had worked in this place for five years. He left here last July with the select men from Camp Pike and was on his way over seas when he fell a victim to the influenza which took his life.\n\nIt was a kind christian act and a splendid piece of work last Wednesday when forty men with their dinner pails and nineteen teams invaded the corn fields at Harry Jones' farm and finished up every row of corn before night. Harry Jones was among the first in this locality to fall a victim to the influenza and for days and weeks his case was critical. During this time his wife, mother and sister died in his home and it has been only within the week that any change could be seen in his case. The good work of the neighbors and townspeople speaks well for the kindly impulse that always beats for the brother in distress.\n\nMiss Ida McSwiggin arrived last week from Wilton Junction on account of the illness of her brother, R. B. McSwiggin.\n\nMrs. C. G. Baird, who is teaching in the high school at Oelwein, took advantage of the influenza vacation and came home last week for a short visit with her mother, Mrs. J. J. Blythe. She came home by way of Osco, Ill., to visit her little daughter who is spending the winter with relatives. The husband, Dr. Baird is at present working in the medical branch of service at one of the base hospitals in France.\n\nMiss Beatrice Rock is home from Gilmore City where she has been teaching for an indefinite vacation which the influenza has brought about.\n\nMiss Arla Jones, who is a student at Iowa came up to spend the week end at her home here.\n\nMrs. Louise Eliza Greif, mother of Rev. H. P. Greif, the pastor of the St. Paul's Lutheran church, died Tuesday morning, November 12 at the home of her son after an illness extending over many weeks. Her death was due to anaemia [sic]. Mrs. Greif was born September 5, 1847 in Rostack, Micklenburg Schwerin, Germany. In 1849 she with her parents emigrated to America and settled in Fort Wayne, Ind. Later they lived in St. Louis and then in New Orleans, La. In April 1874 she was married to Rev. A. D. Greif who was at that time pastor of the congregation in Serbin, Texas. From that place he was called to Davenport, Iowa, where for twenty-eight years he had charge of a congregation. In 1909 Mrs. Greif with her husband went to reside in Charter Oak, Iowa, where Rev. Greif had accepted a call and where they lived until the death of her husband in the winter of 1914. Upon the death of her husband, Mrs. Greif gave up her home and came to Williamsburg, Iowa, where she has lived in love and comfort at the home of her son, Rev. H. P. Greif, at the Lutheran parsonage. Her health had not of last years permitted her to assume many of the active duties of life but she had won the respect and love of those with whom she was associated. Those surviving to mourn her loss are two children, Rev. H. C. Greif [sic] of Williamsburg, Iowa, and Mrs. F. Westphal of Chicago, two sisters, Mrs. F. Huettmann of New Orleans and Mrs. A. Gassner of Washington, Mo., and one brother, Mr. Carl Odendahl of New Orleans and seven grandchildren. The funeral services will be held Thursday afternoon, November 14 at Williamsburg at two o'clock and the burial will be at Charter Oak on Friday where her remains will be taken to be load beside the body of the husband.\n\nAn increase in the number of new cases of influenza in Williamsburg and vicinity has changed the order of the board of health and the quarantine that was scheduled to be lifted Many, November 11 will continue for another week at least.\n\nThe later deaths from this disease include John Spellman, Thirty years old, died early Thursday morning from pneumonia following influenza. Mr. Spellman was an exemplary young man. He was born an dreard [sic] in this community and was graduated from the Williamsburg high school with the class of 1899. He was a member of St. Mary's Catholic church, and the funeral services which were private were held Saturday morning at St. Mary's church. Father Ginnan of Parnell held mass.\n\nWilliam Morris died at the city hotel Thursday after a short illness from influenza. Mr. Morris was born in Wales and had traveled extensively, living at on time in Patagonia. Mr. Morris had made his home here for several years and for the past few years had worked at the City Hotel and at odd jobs about the town. He was believed to be without relatives. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. Robt. Tipton and interment in Oak Hill cemetery.\n\nMrs. John Cox died at her home on Rural 3 on Wednesday morning after an illness of a week from influenza following pneumonia. The funeral services were held Thursday afternoon at St. Joseph's church, Parnell.\n\nThe Iowa City Citizen, Iowa City, Johnson County, Iowa; Friday, 6 December 1918; page 2, column 7\n\nMUTUAL INSURANCE\n\nCOMANY MEETS\n\n----\n\nWilliamsburg, Dec. 5.--The annual meeting of the policy holders of the Patrons Mutual Insurance association was held at this place last week and there was a large representation of the policy holders present.

The following officers were chosen by the directorate:\n\nPresident--Robert H. Edwards.\n\nVice President--C. D. Lortz.\n\nSecretary--U. S. Butler.\n\nTreasurer--D. M. Evans.\n\nThis meeting of the Patrons Mutual is of more than passing interest. Mr. A. b. Ogden retires from the office of secretary owing to the condition of his health. He has been the efficient secretary for twenty-four years and the importance of Mr. Ogden's work in connection with this association can hardly be overestimated. He has been connected with its workings in this county for over thirty-three years and under his management the efficiency of this form of insurance among the people was greatly increased. He wrote the policies, adjusted the losses and kept in touch with all phases of the work. His duties called him out to work over a big scope of territoy [sic] and at all times it was felt that Mr. Odgen in his work between patron and association was just and fair toward both.\n\nAs he retires from the position of secretary he does so with the best will and highest regards of the body be served so long and so well as he always stood ready to do his utmost for the parties he repreesnted [sic] regardless of the effort or cost to himself.\n\nAs a fitting recognition of his competent work the association in its state meeting in Des Moines last week again elected him as a member of its directorate.\n\n----\n\nMr. Howell Williams, Jr., and Mr. J.
