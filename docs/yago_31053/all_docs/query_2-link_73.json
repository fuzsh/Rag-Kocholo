        "canonical_link": "https://elliebellie98.wixsite.com/vaclavhavel",
        "text": "Václav Havel was born October 5th, 1936 to a wealthy Prague family. His grandfather and father were construction moguls who both made significant contributions to the architectural landscape of Prague. Václav Havel’s father, Václav Maria, was a typical bourgeoisie patriarch who was a strong advocate of intellectualism and moral decency. Václav Havel’s mother, Božena, was a strong and intellectual matriarch and was even a minister in the Czechoslovakian government for a short period of time. Havel had a privileged and happy childhood against a backdrop of immense political and social turmoil. For example, in 1938 Czechoslovakia lost the Sudetenland to Hitler in ‘peace’ agreements and in 1939, Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. The turmoil continued after World War II as Czechoslovakia became communist. As a wealthy family with liberal and democratic values, the Havel family faced great animosity and discrimination from the Soviet regime that Havel fought back against his entire life. Havel was denied a formal education in a field of humanities because of his “bourgeois” status. Instead, he was forced to pursue an education in chemical technology because that was deemed to be a working-class pursuit. It was only through night school that Havel was able to stretch his mind and find those who shared the same interests as him, such as philosophy, theater, economics, and politics. Because he could not engage in politics, Havel turned to theater to express his frustrations with the political system. In 1957, Havel was drafted into the army and to elevate boredom, so he said, Havel started a regimental amateur theater troupe. Though the plays he wrote, such as the The Good Soldier Švejk, were more vaudeville in style and farcical than his later more ‘truthful’ work, this use of theater as a means of expression was a significant first for Havel. After leaving the army, Havel was left adrift and languished for a while not knowing what to do with his life. It was then that he discovered the Theater on the Balustrade that specialized in intellectual experimentation. In 1963, Havel wrote his first full length produced play, The Garden Party, which, in a very Brechtian style, was a scathing attack on the Communist government without being heavy-handed or obvious to the officials that censured such things. The play was soon followed by The Memorandum and The Increased Difficulty of Concentration. In 1968, The Memorandum was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which further established Havel as a world-renowned playwright and social commentator. The reason Havel was able to succeed these first few years of his career was because unlike the USSR, Czechoslovakia started its Communist regime with Perestroika and Glasnost (aka openness). This allowed room for artistic endeavors and self-expression. The government began taking away more and more rights causing the Prague Spring in 1968. Havel did not take a significant part in the Prague Spring, however, and only became involved in the revolution after the Prague Spring ended. It was after the repression of the of Prague Spring that Havel seized control of the resistance. Havel started broadcasting anti-communist rhetoric but is soon barred from writing and editing and forced into manual labour. In January of 1977, Havel became the first the first leader of the Charter 77 dissident group that led to his imprisonment on October 18th, 1977. In 1978, Havel published his political manifesto “The Power of the Powerless” which, being considered his most important work, defined and analyzed the ‘post-totalitarian’ system which in turn explained the end goal of his political dissent. Because of this manifesto, in October 1979 Havel was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. After his release, Havel continued to lead the opposition against the communist party. When the Communist regime fell in December of 1989, Václav Havel was chosen as president of Czechoslovakia. Then, as Czechoslovakia crumbled, Havel was elected president of the newly formed Czech Republic on January 26th, 1993. Havel served as president from 1993 until 2003, facing much criticism from his citizens but immense praise abroad. This is because Havel was what could be considered a political genius. He knew that he could not cut corners when forming his new country even though Czech citizens wanted better lives immediately. After he stepped down as president, Havel published the play Leaving, which was a satire based off of Shakespeare’s King Lear and Chekhov’s play The Cherry Orchard. The play was also made into a film which was Havel’s lifelong dream but the film was a flop and was met with harsh criticism. After being sick for many years Václav Havel died on December 18th, 2011.\n\nRocamora, Carol. Acts of Courage: Václav Havel's Life in the Theater.

London: Atlantic Books, 2015.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Czechoslovakia was left deciding what type of new government it wanted to create. Through increasing pressure from Stalin, the Communist party took control in February 1948. The party’s main goal was to consolidate and extend the party’s monopoly of power through a one-party dictatorship. One significant reform was the creation of ‘class enemies’. Anyone who did not fit in the Party’s narrow image was labeled an enemy of the state; Havel and his family were among these ‘enemies’. Private ownership and enterprise were almost completely eliminated while intellectual and artistic pursuits were heavily regulated. From 1953 to 1967, times became a bit more peaceful. There was increased economic stability, de-Stalinization measures were implemented, and the state started to become more socialist. Indeed, in July of 1960, Czechoslovakia became the first country to become a socialist state and was officially called Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. However, this small move toward freedom was not enough for the people. From January to August of 1968, Eastern Europe went through a period of intellectual change, though very little policy reform occurred. In response, The Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia on August 20th 1968 which was the largest mobilization of troops since World War 11. This invasion ushered in a strict communist regime that normalized repressive and inhumane behavior. Through surveillance and violence, the government was able to have complete control over its citizens. That is, until Vaclav Havel came to the political foreground. As mentioned earlier, Havel incited dissidence through his writing and with the creation of Charter 77. Starting in the late 70s and going into the late 80s, there were four main factors that caused the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia. First, the centrally planned economy was failing and the quality of life was deteriorating. Second, with the help of Havel, there was a consolidation of dissident groups into one united front. Third, the Communist party was losing its cohesion and tensions began to grow among officials. Finally, Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika weakened the normalization of communist policies. In 1989, communism collapsed in Czechoslovakia, ushering in an age of democracy and reform.\n\nMcDermott, Kevin. Communist Czechoslovakia, 1945-89: A Political and Social History. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015.\n\nAfter World War II, there were an immense amount of restrictions placed on theater in eastern Europe. In 1956, these restrictions were lessened and experimental theater flourished in Czechoslovakia. One influential figure was designer Josef Svoboda who worked with screens to introduce both live and still images on stage. He would then use these screens to create a flexible stage that could change scene to scene. Svoboda also developed platforms that could move vertically, horizontally, and laterally to rapidly alter the special relations of the acting space. Svoboda is one of the best known and most influential designers in the world and he did much to draw the world’s attention to Czech theater as a whole. Starting in the 50s, there was a rise in small experimental theaters such as The Theater on the Balustrade where Havel produced his plays. These plays started to focus on the problems of the common people and they reflected existential themes, though they remained rooted in traditional realistic forms. The plays reflected a growing spirit of skepticism and interest in individualism. Chekhov’s influence on Czech theater was very strong. This is evident in the plays like A Sunday in August by František Hrubín, Their Day by Josef Topol, and The Owners of the Keys by Milan Kundera which are all about the private and personal lives of the characters instead of the larger ideology or class struggle of the time. In the 60s, there was a return of inventiveness and harsh satire. These satires usually employed grotesque, absurd models of social actualities to underline the abuses of the communist regime. Almost all of these satires tackle the idea of power and how it can seduce and destroy. Czech writers were fascinated with the way humans could be controlled and repressed and this is reflected in almost all of the theater of the time.\n\nBrockett, Oscar G. History of the Theatre.
