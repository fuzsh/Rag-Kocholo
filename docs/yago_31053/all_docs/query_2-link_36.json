        "text": "A glance at their friendship through select transcripts, photographs, letters, and a seating chart or two\n\nAt his 1995 Cornell address, the late Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui addressed a crowd of 5,000 by quoting the words of a great Czech thinker:\n\nCzech president Vaclav Havel said, “The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else but in the human heart.” In my heart, I believe that the Taiwan Experience has something unique to offer the world in this search for a new direction. This is not to say that our experience can be transplanted entirely to fit the situation faced by other nations, but I believe that, without a doubt, there are certain aspects of this experience that offer new hope for the new age.\n\nEchoing Havel’s pursuit of peace, here is how Lee defined the “Taiwan Experience” in the 1995 speech titled “Always in My Heart”:\n\nEssentially, the Taiwan Experience constitutes the economic, political and social transformation of my nation over the years; a transformation which I believe has profound implications for the future development of the Asia-Pacific region and world peace.\n\nThe two great statesmen, both architects of democratization, also shared a friendship. The Czech president irked China by receiving then-PM Lien Chan in Prague on June 22, 1995, a few days after Lee’s much-publicized Cornell visit on June 9, 1995.\n\nThe Washington Post noted:\n\nUndaunted by China’s denunciation of a visit by Taiwanese Prime Minister Lien Chan to his small east European nation, Havel met in his Prague office today with Lien and discussed economic issues and democratic reforms in Taiwan.\n\nOlga Havlová, Havel’s first wife and the final First Lady of Czechoslovakia, made a state visit to Taiwan as early as Dec. 3, 1990. Her five-day itinerary included sightseeing at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Taroko National Park, Taipei World Trade Center, National Palace Museum, and Chang Dai-ch’ien Residence. President Lee even gifted a book of his addresses, “Love and Faith,” to the First Lady.\n\nHere are the seating charts, prepared two different styles, for her meetings and state banquet.\n\nLee and Pavel kept correspondence over the years. Here is a copy of Lee’s 1997 letter inviting the Czech head of state to visit Taiwan.\n\n“I feel strongly that your visit to Taiwan will enrich our shared democratic experience, and I look forward to receiving the benefit of your insight and wisdom first-hand.”\n\nA year after completing his presidency, Havel visited Taiwan in 2004 with his second wife, Dagmar Havlová. They were greeted by Lee’s predecessor, President Chen Shui-bian, Chen’s wife the First Lady Wu Shu-chen, and Vice President Annette Lu. Havel was presented with the Order of the Brilliant Star.\n\nOn why Havel appeared in a wheelchair, the Taipei Times reported:\n\nForced to take a light schedule in Taiwan because of his delicate health, Havel stumbled at the hotel he was staying at and hurt his feet on Sunday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said when explaining why Havel needed a wheelchair.\n\n“It was my bad luck that I got hurt. I often get hurt when visiting other countries. It is not Taiwan’s fault,” Havel said.\n\nDuring his visit, Havel reiterated his support for Taiwan’s UN seat bid:\n\n“Although Taiwan faces a difficult situation in the international community, its people have been courageous. I believe Taiwan should join the UN. I supported Taiwan’s entrance to the UN in the past. I still support its participation in the UN and will do so in the future,” Havel said.\n\nLee and Havel were also reunited at the Czech 2000 Forum themed “Education, Culture and Spiritual Values in the Age of Globalisation,” in which they spoke of the importance of spirituality in their personal and professional lives.\n\nSeem apt to end on this excerpt from Havel’s 1990 New Year’s Address to the Nation, delivered at Prague Castle, Czechoslovakia:\n\nWhen I talk about the contaminated moral atmosphere, I am not talking just about the gentlemen who eat organic vegetables and do not look out of the plane windows. I am talking about all of us. We had all become used to the totalitarian system and accepted it as an unchangeable fact and thus helped to perpetuate it. In other words, we are all — though naturally to differing extents — responsible for the operation of the totalitarian machinery. None of us is just its victim. We are all also its co-creators.\n\nWhy do I say this? It would be very unreasonable to understand the sad legacy of the last forty years as something alien, which some distant relative bequeathed to us. On the contrary. We have to accept this legacy as a sin we committed against ourselves. If we accept it as such we will understand that it is up to us all and up to us alone to do something about it. We cannot blame the previous rulers for everything, not only because it would be untrue, but also because it would blunt the duty that each of us faces today: namely, the obligation to act independently, freely, reasonably and quickly. Let us not be mistaken: the best government in the world, the best parliament and the best president, cannot achieve much on their own. And it would be wrong to expect a general remedy from them alone. Freedom and democracy include participation and therefore responsibility from us all.\n\n…\n\nYou may ask what kind of republic I dream of. Let me reply: I dream of a republic independent, free, and democratic, of a republic economically prosperous and yet socially just; in short, of a humane republic that serves the individual and that therefore holds the hope that the individual will serve it in turn. Of a republic of well-rounded people, because without such people it is impossible to solve any of our problems — human, economic, ecological, social, or political.\n\nThe most distinguished of my predecessors opened his first speech with a quotation from the great Czech educator Komensk. Allow me to conclude my first speech with my own paraphrase of the same statement:\n\nPeople, your government has returned to you!"
