        "text": "If you remarry after your first spouse dies, with whom should you be buried when it's your time to go?\n\nCzech statesman Vaclav Havel's ashes were buried at his family plot at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. His urn was reportedly placed to rest alongside his first wife, Olga Havlova, who died in 1996.\n\nThe dissident playwright who led communist Czechoslovakia to democracy leaves behind a widow, Dagmar Havlova, an actress nearly 20 years his junior, whom he married just short of a year after Olga's death. Mr. Havel died on Dec. 18 at the age of 75.\n\nOlga Havlova, who met Mr. Havel in 1956, was known to have stood by the playwright-turned-president's side through the most difficult times of his life. The two married in 1964.\n\nAt the private burial ceremony, Dagmar Havlova carried her husband's urn, according to reports.\n\nWhile many have reflected on Mr. Havel's political achievements since his death, his burial brings up more mundane politics of determining where, and with whom, to be laid to rest.\n\nIt's not always easy. Last year, the question of where to bury former Venezuelan president Carlos Andres Perez resulted in a widely publicized drama between Mr. Perez's wife, who wanted him interred in Venezuela, and his mistress, who wanted his final resting place to be Miami where the couple lived for most of the last decade of his life."
