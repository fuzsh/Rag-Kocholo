        "text": "Stage reading of a play by Anna Saavedra written in honor of Olga Havlova (1933 - 1996) – a Czech dissident, activist, and the first wife of Vaclav Havel. Set in the famous weekend lodge of Vaclav Havel. The play is supposed to be about his first wife Olga (immortalized in Havel’s \"Letters to Olga\"), yet again and again, Havel interferes with her, plays himself into the foreground with his needs and life plans.\n\nThe playwright Anna Saavedra looks back onto Olga’s life - with a sense of irony of history and related absurdities, because Olga is never allowed to pick mushrooms alone: first, the state police is at her heels; right after the fall of communism, it is the bodyguard of the newly elected President Havel who follows her. With her straightforward manner, Olga is a cynical commentator on the political upheavals - from the wild dissident parties to state receptions. The biographical serves as the basis for the production’s sitcom-like portrait of a woman who defies life with self-irony.\n\nOlga or Horrors from the Havel Cottage. Playwright: Anna Saavedra. Directed by: Barbora Schnelle, Henning Bochert. Performed by: Jeff Biehl, Ethan Hova, Jason Liebman, Natalia Payne.\n\nThe original production on 23 March 2016 at Theater LETÍ at VILA Štvanice in Prague, directed by Martina Schlegelova, won multiple Czech awards in 2016: the Theater Critics Award for best play of the year and best leading actress, and the Theater Journal Award for production of the year.\n\nFor more information about the event, visit www.rehearsalfortruth.org."
