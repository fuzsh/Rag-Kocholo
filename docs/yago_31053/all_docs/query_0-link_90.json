        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThis new feature-length documentary by director Miroslav Janek (known for \"Citizen Havel\" and \"The Four Agreements\") offers a personal portrait of Olga Havlová, the first lady and an exceptional personality known for her close and reliable partnership with Václav Havel. Olga was known as a fun-loving friend who never spoiled the fun but rather created it, a generous hostess, an avid gamer and mushroom picker, a nature lover, a sharp commentator, and a brave, tireless dissident. She was a pragmatic woman, always grounded and true to herself. This film goes beyond a mere biographical account, showing her from a more personal, civilian side. Known publicly as Václav Havel's wife and the founder of the Good Will Committee foundation, Olga is portrayed here through previously unreleased archival footage and photographs, as well as personal testimonies of friends. Janek focuses less on official biographical data, allowing these personal and intimate materials to speak for her life and legacy.\n\nProduct Details DVD\n\nLength 87 min.\n\nProduction Year 2014\n\nAudio Czech\n\nSubtitles Czech, English\n\nFormat DVD (PAL)\n\nRegion 2\n\nDirector Miroslav Janek\n\nCast Olga Havlova, Vaclav Havel\n\nNote for US customers: It might not play on some US DVD players, Multi-Region and Multisystem PAL/NTSC DVD player is required, Please check your DVD player\n\nIf you’re looking to return or exchange your order for whatever reason, we're here to help!
