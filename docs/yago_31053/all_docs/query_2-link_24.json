        "text": "Olga Havlová Street, named after the first wife of the late former President Václav Havel, was inaugurated on Wednesday in the Prague neighbourhood of Žižkov. The street is located in a newly develop area in the eastern part of the neighbourhood. Olga Havlová, née Šípková, was born in Žižkov in 1933; she died of cancer in 1996. The head of the Committee of Good Will, established by Olga Havlová in 1990, said it took the authorities 13 years to name a street after the former first lady."
