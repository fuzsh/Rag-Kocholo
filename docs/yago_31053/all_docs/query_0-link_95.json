        "text": "The death of Vaclav Havel comes in a month in which we mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Few voices did more to undermine the foundations of the Berlin Wall and the entire edifice of Soviet-imposed totalitarianism than this shy bourgeois, this sly, reticent, playwright and essayist. In a parallel universe, in a luckier realm, Havel would have lived out his life as a Czech epigone of Ionesco and Beckett, a carefree son of privilege, free to write, to pursue his pleasures, to listen to the rock ‘n roll he loved. Instead, like a living figure from Kafka, he was born to a system where absurdity, not law, ruled; calmly, resolutely, he pursued a life of dissidence, led a revolution, and then assumed a home in the Castle, the seat of power in liberated Prague.\n\nEven surrounded by the pomp of his office, Havel retained to the end an impish smile, a constant acknowledgement that his power was both an immense responsibility and an equally immense cosmic joke. I came to the Castle, in 2003, to talk with him for a Profile just as he was preparing to leave power. He gave me as a gift a marvelous book of photographs portraying his life as an artist and politician. He signed it to my wife, who had covered the 1989 revolution in Prague with me, in lime-green marker and then drew a little heart, in red, next to his signature. I have a hard time imagining any other president goofing around like that.\n\nHavel’s biography—the most remarkable and joyously absurd of biographies—is well known. Or should be. What really ought not to be lost, what enriches the spirit beyond his triumphant, inimitable example, is the writing. (I’ve assembled a reading list .) What world leader has ever exposed the texture of his own mind with more honesty? His essays, letters, and speeches comprise the spiritual autobiography of a public man. Other dissidents have reached the seat of power--in post-colonial Africa, for example--but none with the same complexity of spirit.\n\nHavel was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996. When the cancer re-appeared, two years later, he quit smoking. It’s a wonder that he lived to be seventy-five. This morning, after learning that Havel had died, I spent a couple of hours re-reading parts of my favorite book of his, his letters from prison to his first wife, the late Olga Havlova. “Letters to Olga,” which was published here in 1983, gives the most vivid sense of the man: his love for his wife; his descriptions of prison and interrogation; his warden, a Hitler sympathizer; thoughts on his polemical disputes other writers and dissidents; the state of everything from his spiritual ruminations to his bowels.\n\nSolzhenitsyn’s motto was “Live not the lie.” Havel’s was the same; it was essential to live within truth, and he always wrote as a free man, forever ignoring the lies and the jackboot of his oppressor."
