        "text": "In contrast to the main body of current Victorian detective criticism, which tends to concentrate on Conan Doyle’s creation and only uses other detectives as a backdrop, the texts gathered in this volume examine various contemporary ways of (re)presenting real and fictional detectives that originated in or are otherwise associated with that era: Inspector Bucket, Sergeant Cuff, Inspector Reid, Tobias Gregson, Flaxman Low, and psychiatrists as detectives. Such a collection allows for a critical re-assessment of both the detectives’ importance to the Victorian literature and culture and provides a better basis for understanding the reasons behind their contemporary returns, re-imaginings and re-creations, contributing to the creation of a base for further cultural and critical works dealing with reworkings of the Victorian era.\n\nThe article uses detective fiction and Arthur Conan Doyle’s protagonists Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson to analyze the crisis of late-bourgeois subject culture towards the end of the 19th century. It shows that the shift from the early bourgeois code of morality to the later code of respectability leads to a deeply felt ambivalence within middle-class subjectivity. In the analysis of A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, and of short stories from the first collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the article analyse how Holmes and Watson embody bourgeois culture while at the same time also transgressing its boundaries. In the discussion of detective fiction, the article then relates the ambivalences of late-bourgeois subject culture to the genre’s conventions and to the specific reception process that it trains the reader in.\n\nAdvisor: Professor James Hopkins Master of Arts conferred May 14, 2016 Dissertation completed April 15, 2016 Southern Methodist University Today’s popular culture is inundated with adaptations of and references to Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories about Great Britain’s most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. But the private detective’s impact on the Victorian society into which he was born is much more pervasive and far reaching, then and now, than a visit to the little flat on Baker Street could possibly convey. Examining the history of the British private detective both in fiction and in life shows that the figure has been used as a metaphorical plumb-line for English self-conception since the Victorian era. This thesis looks at the British private detective from different points of view– the police, government officials, the public, literature, media, and detectives themselves – and shows how the figure can serve as a compelling historical lens through which to view changes in British culture in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\nAccounts of criminals, their victims, and their pursuers have become entrenched within the sphere of popular culture; most obviously in the genres of true crime and crime fiction. The centrality of the pursuer in the form of the detective, within these stories, dates back to the nineteenth century. This, often highly-stylised and regularly humanised protagonist, is now a firm feature of both factual and fictional accounts of crime narratives that, today, regularly focus on the energies of the detective in solving a variety of cases. So familiar is the figure of the detective, it seems that these men and women—amateurs and professionals—have always had an important role to play in the pursuit and punishment of the wrongdoer. Yet, the first detectives were forced to overcome significant resistance from a suspicious public. Some early efforts to reimagine punishment and to laud the detective include articles written by Charles Dickens; pieces on public hangings and policing that reflect the great Victorian novelist's commitment to shed light on, through written commentaries, a range of important social issues. This article explores some of Dickens's lesser-known pieces, that— appearing in daily newspapers and in one of his own publications Household Words—helped to change some common perceptions of punishment and policing.\n\nJuly 2001 : Monuments and Dust Conference, London (Victorian London) Institute of Historical Studies, Senate House When I started working on 19 th century detective fiction, I was struck by the major differences between French and British novels. The French did not hesitate to resort to judges or police officials 1 who often were fallible whereas the British novelists generally resorted to amateurs or private investigators. (The main exception being Sergeant Cuff in Wilkie Collins's first detective story, The Moonstone, 1868, Cuff being both fallible and talented.) At first, I explained this phenomenon only through the very different literary influences in France and in Great Britain. While France's main 19 th century writers were realists of the naturalistic trend, Great Britain was very much under the influence of the Gothic novel. However, I felt that the History of Modern Great Britain and that of Modern France probably had a lot to account for as well. The French and the British had very different points of view on police and justice, for instance. On the other hand, they shared a common interest in science and the use of science within the judicial field. So how did British detective fiction get its specificity? This study will try to show the birth of a new genre within the Victorian and Edwardian era, studying various aspects of this period that had a bearing on the birth of a new literary genre. First I shall consider the attitude of the writers and readers towards the British police and justice system, then their fascination for the legal aspects of science."
