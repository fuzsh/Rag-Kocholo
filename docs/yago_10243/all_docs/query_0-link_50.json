        "text": "NEW YORK — Summer may be in the air, but at the premiere of “A Lot Like Love” here this past Monday, Amanda Peet was all about fall. She turned up on the red carpet in a girlish frock from Oscar de la Renta’s fall 2005 collection. As co-stars Kathryn Hahn and Ashton Kutcher, with ladylove Demi Moore; director Nigel Cole, with wife Kate Isitt, and Sarah Paulson made the red-carpet rounds, Peet stood out from the mostly black-clad crowd in de la Renta’s gold tulle filigree sequin dress with a brown ribbon belt. With all those gold spangles, the actress kept her decorative flourishes to a minimum, choosing sleek hair and gold sandals as finishing touches."
