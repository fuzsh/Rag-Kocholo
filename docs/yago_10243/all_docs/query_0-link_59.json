        "text": "With it's catchy songs, charming performances and a hilarious plot line, Nativity! has become a modern Christmas classic in the 12 years since its release.\n\nWhile it stars funnyman Martin Freeman, the heart of the film is its cast of loveable children who are working towards their festive concert - packed with plucky, pop-style original songs.\n\nNow, more than a decade after the film's release, the young stars are working as performers, fashion designers and business owners, and are offering fans a glimpse into their lives on social media.\n\nIn fact, there's even a TikTok trend dedicated to unearthing the children from the film - with the hashtag 'Nativity Cast' gaining a whopping 21.7M views.\n\nSome cast members are boasting as many as 25K followers on the app despite only having a few videos, while videos unearthing users favourite stars have as many as 2.5million views.\n\nHere, FEMAIL reveals what the cast of one of Britain's favourite Christmas films have been up to over a decade later.\n\nBen Wilby, 19, plays Bob\n\nA firm favourite of viewers, Ben Wilby played the lovable Bob, who stole the show with his hilarious singing and dance moves, as well as his hilarious one liners.\n\nThe young actor, from Cannock in Staffordshire, has already overcome a lot in his life - with doctors warning he may never walk or talk after a nine-hour operation as a child.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Craniosynostosis, a birth defect in which the bones in a baby's skull join together too early, when he was just two - with doctors warning his parents he may not survive a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.\n\nBut Ben defied the odds and joined a dance school to develop his balance and improve the strength in his legs. He went on to win a number of trophies, including the title of European Freestyle Champion.\n\nDetermined to live life in the limelight, Ben then beat 500 other young hopefuls to win the role of Bob in the hit film, Nativity, having turned up to the auditions wearing an audacious outfit of neon green shorts, legwarmers and a t-shirt with the slogan 'Born To Dance' on it.\n\nAfter his appearance in the film, Ben, now 19, went on to feature in two other Nativity! movies, as well as appearances in television series' Father Brown and Cuckoo.\n\nHe is currently studying at drama school Emil Dale Academy in Hitchin and regularly posts videos about his Nativity! fame to his 74K followers on TikTok.\n\nEllie Coldicutt, 24, plays Beth\n\nSparkle & Shine was one of the breakout hits from the 2009 movie, and the standout performance went to Ellie Coldicutt, who played the little girl sitting on the moon with tinsel in her hair.\n\nEllie, who lives in Ullenhall, near Henley-in-Arden, showed performing prowess from a young age and has been acting and singing from the age of eight.\n\nBy the age of 13 she had starred in the UK tour of The Sound Of Music and a stage version of The Secret Garden in both Edinburgh and Toronto.\n\nHowever her life took a different direction when she went to university, deciding to put acting aside and study law and criminology at the University of the West of England in Bristol.\n\nAfter graduating in July 2019, Ellie began working at a marketing agency in the west Midlands before bagging a job as a marketing executive in Leamington Spa in August this year.\n\nAs well as pursuing a career in marketing, Ellie has founded a successful fashion business called Elrosé Clothing - an online boutique selling every-day womenswear pieces.\n\nEllie often posts glamorous snaps of her life on Instagram, recently jetting off to Marbella for a sun-soaked holiday and will celebrate her 24th birthday today [02/12].\n\nBrandon McDonald, 23, plays Oli\n\nBrandon, from Warwickshire, played cheeky St Bernadette's pupil Oli who sang the famous 'extra spicy' line in the three king's number and turned purple while holding his breath during his audition.\n\nHe appeared in all three Nativity! films but seems to have taken a step away from the acting world since his stint in the spotlight, changing his name and keeping a low profile on social media.\n\nThe former actor has a girlfriend called Daisy and the pair often share loved up snaps and videos on social media.\n\nA video of Brandon eating in a chain restaurant while his famous song She's the Brightest Star plays over the top recently went viral on TikTok, gathering over 300K likes and 22K comments.\n\nUsers were thrilled to see how Brandon is getting on since his appearance in the film and left a host of hilarious comments about the famous Christmas film.\n\n'So good to see Ollie on the phone securing the deal for Nativity 4', said one, while another asked 'I wonder if he's still got beef with Alfie'.\n\nKrista Hyatt, 22, as Becky\n\nWhile she wasn't a pupil of St Bernadette's, Krista Hyatt's Becky was a memorable member of the cast thanks to her impressive dance skills.\n\nKrista portrayed a student from posh rival school Oakmoor when she was nine alongside her dance partner and best pal Charlie Dixon.\n\nThe duo made up the Cheeky Monkey's, who found fame after making it to the final of Britain's Got Talent season two in 2008 with their dance routines.\n\nHowever in January 2011, the pair split up after Charlie was offered a scholarship at the Hammond School in Cheshire.\n\nNow 22, Krista has had an incredible transformation, often sharing glamorous snaps on her social media pages and amassing a huge number of followers on TikTok.\n\nKrista, who is thought to be studying dance, has 14.7K Followers on the app and often shares her memories of her early career with her followers.\n\nSydney Isitt-Ager , 22, as Sadie\n\nWhile she may have played Sadia, the shy pupil who tells Mr Madden that she's too nervous to perform in the extravagant show, 22-year-old Sydney is far from sheepish.\n\nSydney, who is the daughter of Debbie Isitt, who wrote and directed Nativity, has been very busy since her first on-screen appearance, having enrolled in drama school and started two businesses.\n\nShe is studying at Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom where she recently starred in her school's version of Legally Blonde as Paulette - with her mum branding her 'fabulous and funny as hell' on social media.\n\nAs well as training to become an actress, Sydney runs her own beauty and cosmetics company in Coventry offering make-up and eyelash extensions.\n\nSydney, who boasts over 25K Followers on TikTok, also runs a jewellery business selling bespoke hand crafted jewellery 'custom made to suit your spirit' online.\n\nShe has amassed a huge number of followers on Instagram and often shares glamorous pictures of herself wearing stylish outfits, lavish holidays and on nights out with pals.\n\nCadi Mullane, 21, as Crystal\n\nCadi put in a memorable performance as Crystal, who was one of the stars during the final performance in the film.\n\nThe Welsh-born actress is currently training at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and has a keen following on social media, boasting over 1,500 on Instagram and over 5,000 on TikTok.\n\nCadi, who is currently in a relationship with long-term boyfriend Morgan, explained in one of her social media videos how she came to bag the role of Crystal in the Christmas classic.\n\nTaking to TikTok, Cadi explained that at the age of seven she was tipped for the audition, looking for 'chatty kids who could dance and sing a little bit' through an agency she belonged to.\n\nShe had to travel up to London from Wales seven times for auditions and was tested on her singing ability and how well she interacted with other cast members.\n\nRecalling one of her favourite moments on set, she revealed that A-lister Martin Freeman sang happy birthday to her the day she turned eight, and says she has fond memories of living with co-stars in a hotel and improvising lines.\n\nAs for whether she keeps up with her Nativity! co-stars, Cadi says while they don't keep in regular contact they do all follow each other on social media.\n\nMaeve Dolan, 20, as Sam\n\nOne adorable scene that sticks in the minds of Nativity! fans is the hilarious moment a young girl called Sam auditions for the school play with a rendition of Wheatus' Teenage Dirtbag.\n\nAnd the little girl, famous for her striped beanie hat, was played by 20-year-old Maeve who is a Coventry local who moved to London to study music at university.\n\nMaeve attended West Coventry Academy before studying at London College of Music and has gathered over 4,000 followers on TikTok, where she uploads videos doing viral dance routines, playing guitar and cooking.\n\nShe told her followers about her role in the film last year on TikTok after another user asked cast members to duet her video, and Maeve was met with hundreds of comments from shocked fans.\n\n'You still rock the beanie though Maeve', wrote one. Another added: 'Out of everyone else I always wondered how YOU were doing'.\n\nJake Pratt, 25, as Alfie\n\nRemembered for his fight with Oli over the coveted role of Joseph, Alfie was played by 25-year-old Jake from Scarborough.\n\nJake first entered the public eye in series one of Britain's Got Talent where he reached the semi-finals doing stand up comedy.\n\nFollowing his stint on the reality show he appeared on kids's show Green Balloon Club and did voice over work before landing the role of Alfie in the comedy Christmas film.\n\nFollowing Nativity! Pratt went on to star in the West End's Billy Elliot the Musical, where he played the role of Michael before bagging the part of Nigel Hicks in the Stratford production of Matilda the Musical.\n\nJake, who is currently in a relationship with long-term girlfriend Olivia, would later play Tommy in the West End production of the same show.\n\nTom McGarrity, 27, as Zack\n\nDubbed the 'Zac Efron' of the fictional school by Mr Poppy's character, Zack was played by 27-year-old Tom, from Coventry, who has continued to pursue a career in the showbiz world.\n\nTom is a talented dancer and has spent the last few years working as a dancer performing on cruises and in holiday parks.\n\nRecently he did a season performing at Birchington Vale Holiday Park in Kent and has since set off on a cruise performing with Mirage Shows.\n\nOver the years he's travelled all over the world performing, posting snaps from Australia and South Africa while working as a cruise ship singer."
