        "text": "LONDON – Lucy Punch, Rufus Hound and Robert Webb are teaming with director Nigel Cole to shoot The Wedding Video, a rom-com billed as an expose on English society weddings in Spinal Tap-style.\n\nPunch recently filmed Bad Teacher with Cameron Diaz, Hound is best known as an actor and comedian and Webb is familiar to cult comedy followers of TV’s Peep Show.\n\nThe trio also star alongside a cast that already boasts Miriam Margolyes, Michelle Gomez and Harriet Walter.\n\nCole joins up with writing partner Firth again having last collaborated on Calendar Girls.\n\nIt details the story of a shambolic yet loveable best man who decides the greatest gift he can give his friend and his bride is a video of their wedding. It doesn’t quite end up that way.\n\nProduced by James Gay-Rees, whose recent doc Senna took the audience award at Sundance, the picture is exec produced by Entertainment Film Distributor’s Nigel Green and Timeless Films’ Ralph Kamp.\n\nEntertainment has U.K. distribution rights while Kamp’s Timeless will handle international sales on it.\n\nThe film shoots on location in the U.K. for seven weeks."
