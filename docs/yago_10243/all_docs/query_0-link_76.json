Hunt, who played the Naturist Singer/Guitarist, is an actual musician. She wrote some of the songs which were performed during the film.\n\nMartin Freeman, Jason Watkins and Marc Wootton would all go on to appear in the first Nativity! film, with Jason and Marc also appearing in the second and third films. Jessica Hynes also appeared in the second film. All three films were written and directed by Debbie Isitt, who directed Confetti, and Nicky Ager and Nick Jones worked on all three as well.\n\nSome parts of this film were filmed at Spielplatz in St. Albans, which is known for being the longest operating naturist resort in Britain. As of 2018, this is the only film filmed there which isn't a nudist film (though this film does have some naturists in it).\n\nRecommendations[]\n\nSee also[]\n\n[]"
