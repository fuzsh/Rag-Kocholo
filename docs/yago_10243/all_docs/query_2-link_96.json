        "text": "\"Police in Montserrat\": 45-minute documentary of the band recording Ghost in the Machine, including four songs performed in Montserrat: Demolition Man, One World (Not Three), Spirits in the Material World, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic Hosted by keyboardist and TV personality Jools Holland, the program starts with an introduction to the island of Montserrat and then gets to the band in the studio. Rather than focus on the recording of the album, we find separate sessions with Andy Summers, Sting, and Stewart Copeland. Summers offers a guitar demonstration that includes glimpses of “Message in a Bottle” with or with effects. He also plays a little jam with Holland. Sting goes over the recording process and gives us insight into his songwriting. He chats about how he came up with “Message” and we also meet “Brian”, his upright electric bass. We get another jam with Holland, and Summers eventually joins in as well. Lastly, Holland speaks with Copeland about his drum kit and style. No jam occurs between them, though. The program fills out with studio videos for “Demolition Man”, “One World (Not Three)”, “Spirits In the Material World”, and “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic”. These will look very familiar to anyone who’s already watched the main collection of videos, as they show the same form of mimed studio work. I’d have liked to really see the band record Ghost, but “Montserrat” possesses some informational and entertainment value nonetheless.\n\nWhat Britain does best is breed new bands. One of the things LATER WITH JOOLS HOLLAND tries to do best is to spot those new bands as they emerge and put them on television. When 'Later' started in 1992, British rock and roll was still in the doldrums and grunge ruled OK. Fortunately things got better fast. Blur, Oasis and the rest kickstarted Britpop, Paul Weller found his stride again and they were all happy enough to come on the show and do what they do best and play live. Bands like Radiohead and The Verve would play the show when they wouldn't even do Top Of The Pops. Travis appeared on 'Later' when they'd released their first limited edition single, Stereophonics, Catatonia and then Coldplay made their TV debuts on the programme and kept on coming back. They started as debutantes and came back as headliners. Last series Keane, Franz Ferdinand and 22-20s all came on 'Later' to stake their claim. From 1993 to 2003, here's young British Rock and Roll flexing its muscles, history in the making.\n\nWelcome to the second 'Later' DVD, a journey down rock from the dark side. Here's a decade's worth of rock and roll with a razor's edge that takes you back to some of the West Coast torch bearers of the early 90s - step forward Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, even the dark lords themselves, Metallica, - and then plunges you into the heart of the new rock of The White Stripes, The Vines and The Hives. Not many of the bands are English and the immediate qualifications for inclusion include the possession of dark glasses or leather jackets, great drummers and the ability to throw shapes in the studio. In America they call this stuff modern rock. On 'Later' these are the bands who've exploded out of their corner like a bomb, driven by angst or rage or the simple joys of making some noise...\n\nIn 1993 while on a European tour LEONARD COHEN came into the Later…with Jools Holland studio at Television Centre during the show’s second series with his impressive band and angelic backing singers to perform two songs from The Future album - the title track and Democracy - both extraordinarily prescient post this week’s American election, and finished the show with an extraordinary, hymn-like version of his devastating ‘Dance Me To The End of Love’ from the Various Positions album. Cohen also chatted to Jools about his vision and his career and enjoyed seeing a clip of his duet with Julie Felix on Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye from her 1967 BBC TV series, Once More with Felix, for the very first time. Includes all those performances and the interview in 25 plus-minutes of the great Leonard Cohen on Later…with Jools Holland.\n\nJools Holland's long-established Hogmanay/New Year's Eve celebration Later … Hootenanny remains TV's definitive dad-rock haven after 11 years on air. Amusingly, the outing comes close to shooting itself in the foot by opening with Solomon Burke's rip-roaring \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\", thus giving the following 31 turns a near-impossible act to follow. If in doubt, watch it at the end, as the everybody-up-on-stage version of Jeff Beck's \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" that closes the show is unfortunately a shambles. Along the way, though, there are plenty of highlights, the best of which add up to a triumph for the Welsh contingent. Cerys Matthews and Tom Jones do their best smoochy version of \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" before it began to wear a bit thin, the strapping Matthews managing to come on like a cross between Bambi and that girl you fancied in the lower sixth. Immediately preceding this is a gloriously menacing performance from John Cale in which he turns Johnny Mercer's jazz classic \"I Wanna Be Around\" into a leering, spitting threat to the listener's personal safety. There's something for everyone here, though, so just enjoy the show.\n\nJourney into 2009 with Jools Holland, his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and a stellar line-up of talent. Featuring Martha and the Vandellas, Dizzee Rascal, Annie Lennox, The Ting Tings, Dave Edmunds, Duffy, Svang, Adele, Sam Sparro, The Hold Steady, Rico Rodriguez, Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones and Lily Allen. On the eve of Motown's 50th anniversary, Martha and the Vandellas join with Jools to play some of the greatest songs of the 60s including Dancing In The Street and (Love Is Like A) Heatwave. Annie Lennox sings one of her solo hits and a classic big band tune, Dave Edmunds performs 70s tunes like I Hear You Knocking, Sam Sparro takes his signature Black and Gold in a swing direction and Lily Allen will surprise you with her take on a classic standard. Also Adele sings Etta James, Duffy asks for Mercy, Dizzee Rascal requests you to Dance Wiv Me, old-school rock band of the year The Hold Steady stay positive, The Ting Tings do a name check and Finnish harmonica quartet Svang are tunefully strange. Plus of course, the usual combination of actors, actresses, comedians and general hipsters fill the room with their predictions and the 1st Battalion Scots Guards pipe into 2009.\n\nJools Holland returns to the BBC studios for an incredible 17th Hootenanny. Joining Jools' Rhythm & Blues Orchestra are Sir Tom Jones with classic moments from his songbook and the odd rousing soul cover; Boy George with classic Culture Club numbers and a song that reflects on his stay in Pentonville; and Paolo Nutini with tunes from his bestselling album Sunny Side Up, plus a Wynonie Harris cover. Also performing are three young women who've broken big this year: Shingai Shoniwa with a big band version of her Noisettes' smash Don't Forget The Rhythm from their album Wild Young Hearts; Florence The Machine with a couple of songs from her bestselling debut Lungs, plus a classic Nina Simone number with the Orchestra; also Paloma Faith with the song New York from her debut album Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful? and a Dinah Washington cover. Classic British guitarist Dave Edmunds reprises his 1968 speed-crazed guitar hit Sabre Dance, plus there are cameos from Orchestra stalwarts Ruby Turner and Rico Rodriguez. Joining the orchestra in the star-packed studio are also Dizzee Rascal with hits from Tongue 'N Cheek including the year's anthem Bonkers, and Kasabian with anthems from West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum, the British rock album of the year, with a cameo from the show's favourite Mexican thrash-metal-meets-flamenco duo Rodrigo Y Gabriela. The New Year is piped in by the band of the 1st Battalion of Scots Guards while the musical talent are joined by famous faces including Al Murray, Jack Dee, Jo Brand, Vic Reeves, the BBC Formula One team, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Jo Wood, Ben Miller, Peter Capaldi and many more, offering their thoughts, predictions and resolutions on the Noughties and the departing and incoming year.\n\nJoining Jools, a host of stars from all walks of British life plus the odd polar bear, a variety of star guest singers sitting in with Jools' Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and some of the star turns of 2010. Pop queen Kylie Minogue returns to the show to duet with Jools on a Blossom Dearie tune and perform a classic hit or two; reggae star Toots Hibbert of Toots and The Maytals fame performs classic hits like Monkey Man and Pressure Drop; and the original queen of rockabilly, Wanda Jackson from Oklahoma, rocks the house with her blend of rockabilly and country and offers her take on Amy Winehouse's You Know I'm No Good. One of the stars of the year, neo-soul man and Gnarls Barkley frontman Cee-Lo Green, performs a special version of his Forget You smash from his album, The Lady Killer and shares his love of Jackie Wilson with the Orchestra. Rumer performs songs from her hit debut album Seasons of My Soul, The Who's Roger Daltrey sings Muddy Waters, and Rhythm and Blues Orchestra regulars Ruby Turner and Rico Rodriguez sing gospel-soul and ska respectively. Plus East Coast boys Vampire Weekend stop in to bring some of their African-inflected dance tunes from their Contra album to thaw the winter chill. Bellowhead perform tunes from their latest opus Hedonism; and there's also music from Plan B, with his retro street-soul stylings from the hit album, The Defamation of Strickland Banks. Also look out for an introductory acoustic spot from Nashville's Secret Sisters, Laura and Lydia Rogers. Plus the reflections of a room packed with talent of all descriptions on the departing year and their hopes and predictions for 2011, and the band of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards.\n\nA host of musical stars, from Ray Davies to Rudimental, join Jools Holland as he reflects on 2013 and celebrates the arrival of the new year. Rock veteran Davies joins Jools and his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra for classic singalongs, while east London outfit Rudimental, one of the big success stories of 2013, bring songs from their debut LP, Home. They are joined by guest vocalists including Ella Eyre and Emeli Sandé. Jools and his Orchestra accompany singer Charlie Wilson, while soul voices Laura Mvula and Lisa Stansfield also take to the stage. Californian indie pop band Haim perform songs from their debut album Days Are Gone along with their take on a Fleetwood Mac number, while there are stomping anthems courtesy of The Proclaimers. John Newman, another star that emerged in 2013, joins Jools and his R&B Orchestra, as does Melanie C who performs a couple of numbers, including a Stevie Wonder classic with soul singer Ruby Turner. Jamaican singer Dawn Penn joins forces with Madness saxophonist Lee Thompson and his Ska Orchestra, and The Lumineers present tracks from their self-titled debut LP. The Pipes & Drums of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards lead the way into the new year.\n\nJools Holland provides the best possible party to see in the last bit of 2014 and welcome in the new year. Jools and his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra are joined by a mix of artists - those who have had a stellar 2014 and those whose songs are timeless classics. Ronnie Spector, lead singer of iconic 1960s girl group The Ronettes, joins Jools to perform some classic tunes. Ed Sheeran, arguably one of the most successful solo artists around the world right now, performs solo and with Jools and the Orchestra. Boz Scaggs joins Jools to perform tracks from his 1975 bestseller Silk Degrees, while Paisley's own Paolo Nutini performs tracks with his band from his Caustic Love LP.

The Pipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards lead the way into the new year.\n\nJools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra welcome in the new year with a studio packed full of musical stars for his traditional Annual Hootenanny. As we see out 2021 and ring in 2022, Jools invites a spectacular cast of guest singers to help him and his band put on the best party in town, as well as taking time to reflect on years gone by with some of the best performances from the hit-packed Hootenanny archive. Joining Jools and his Orchestra in the studio this year are Ed Sheeran, Gregory Porter, Lulu, Joy Crookes, Rag'n'Bone Man, Yola, Vic Reeves, Ruby Turner and the Pipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards. And there are archive performances from the likes of Craig David, Mandess and Soul II Soul, promising a musical medley of legends and newies, pop bangers and treasured classics to guide and entertain us through the last moments of 2021 and into 2022.\n\nJoining Jools for the music show are Glasgow's favourite art school rockers Franz Ferdinand, with songs from their most recent album Tonight.

Sheffield's Richard Hawley returns with songs from Hollow Meadows, his eighth solo album and another widescreen blend of melancholy and autobiography.

Moving to London after finishing her studies in 2010, Letissier found herself drawn to the performing arts underworld of Soho, where she met the drag queens of Madame JoJo's, who inadvertently helped birth her musical project. She has grown to become a huge mainstream star in her native France, and is known for her energetic and visually arresting live shows, which see her interact with four male dancers and a shadowy four-piece band. She - and they - will be showing off her dance-art-pop sound and style on the show. From Sunderland and making their Later… debut are Field Music, who are essentially brothers David and Peter Brewis.

There's a solo visit from Sir Elton John, borrowing Jools's piano to perform numbers from his 32nd album, Wonderful Crazy Night.

Firstly, Mancunian energetic new comers Spring King, a four piece started by singer and drummer Tarek Musa, who are quickly becoming known for their lively shows and high-energy garage rock tunes. Secondly, from Canada, indie-folk singer songwriter Basia Bulat.

Bonnie Raitt returns to the show to run through some of the songs from her recently released twentieth album Dig in Deep. In addition to originals, Raitt has recorded material by some of her favourite working songwriters, and a couple of knock-out covers. Dig in Deep features a healthy dose of the signature slide work from the woman Rolling Stone named one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Malian kora player Ballake Sissoko and French cellist Vincent Segal have pulled two seemingly incompatible instruments together, melding Sissoko's traditional playing with Segal's trip hop-infused approach to the classical cello to great effect on their second album together. NAO makes her TV debut with her neo-soul, electro and R&B sound that has already seen her nominated for a MOBO award. Another act making their debut on the show are Dinosaur Jr. They earned themselves a reputation as one of the formative influences on US alt-rock in the 80s and early 90s before splitting in 1997. A reunion followed in 2005 and now the original line-up are making the trip to Maidstone, Kent, to play some new songs.

Incredibly, Tame Impala first appeared on Later in November 2012 alongside Biffy Clyro! The Scottish trio also have a date with destiny in the shape of the Later studio and return at their melodic and piledriving best with tunes from their seventh album Ellipsis, which has all the melody, power and musical complexity that we've come to expect, as showcased on lead track Wolves of Winter. Also returning to the studio is singer-songwriter Michael Kiwanuka who previews the big soul sound of his second album Love and Hate, which successfully expands the blueprint of his solo music which helped make him the BBC Sound of 2012. And introducing the punk-jazz of Brooklyn-based trio Moon Hooch, who peddle horns, drums and party in their unique and noisy blend of what they like to call cave music as featured on forthcoming album Red Sky. As their press release claims, 'it's like house but it's more wild, more jagged, more free, more natural to live in.' James Blake returns to the show fresh from collaborating with Beyonce on her Lemonade album with songs from his third album The Colour of Anything, which features a cover by Quentin Blake (no relation) and which builds on Blake's hushed fusion of balladry and dubstep, continuing his mission to 'subdue a generation' as he joked to the Guardian recently. And introducing singer-songwriter Lera Lynn, whose latest album Resistor is a noirish blend of late-night atmospherics, tough rock n roll and sparse poetry.\n\nLater...with Jools Holland returns for its 49th series with the sort of exclusives that makes it the key taste-making destination in music television. Nashville's Kings of Leon return to Jools' theatre of dreams with their first album in three years, Walls, which finds them re-energised and returning to the anthemic sound and classic songwriting of their best work, thanks in part to producer Markus Dravs. Jack White has appeared on the show with the White Stripes, The Raconteurs, Dead Weather, and recently toured and fronted not one but two bands of different genders, but now he makes his solo acoustic debut, re-interpreting songs from his back catalogue - many of which are previously unreleased, ahead of a whole album collecting acoustic work from 1988-2016. Multi-Grammy award winning Sting has sold over 100 million albums and has been touring the past two years with both Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel, but he's also found time to make his first straight-ahead rock 'n' roll album in many a year. 57th & 9th refers to the street he crossed on his way to the New York studio where he recorded this thirteenth solo work, showcasing Sting at his canniest and most direct as displayed in new single, I Can't Stop Thinking About You, which echoes his work with The Police. Stir into that, the dark R 'n' B of LA's Banks, who's about to release her second album The Altar, and Antibes-grown LA based Frenchman Anthony Gonzalez's band M83 with the delightful 80s inflected disco dream pop of seventh studio album Junk and you've got the kind of mix that only Jools can provide, all quality, no filler.\n\nJools Holland presents hot, legendary and relatively unknown artists in performance. Jools invites another eclectic mix of music into his quadrangle of quality, including national treasures Madness, who are about to release their 12th studio album Can't Touch Us Now.

Also introducing Rag'n'Bone Man, a big bruiser of a man from Uckfield near Brighton, with his debut single, the tender Human, a piano ballad which manages to be both vulnerable and threatening at the same time.\n\nHot on the heels of a swanky evening at the Royal Albert Hall celebrating 25 years on BBC Two, Jools returns to Maidstone with the first programme of the autumn series. Joining Jools is the now solo Liam Gallagher, who has been reminding the world of his indomitable rock 'n' roll spirit and how to rock a parka since his comeback at Glastonbury this summer. Gallagher and his band perform songs from his debut solo album As You Were, including lead track Wall of Glass. Of course Liam has been on Later a few times with Oasis and Beady Eye - while north London-raised Benjamin Clementine only appeared once, back in 2013, sandwiched between Paul McCartney and Arctic Monkeys, but it launched his solo career, which culminated in a 2015 Mercury Prize triumph for his debut album At Least for Now. Now he is back, stepping out from behind the piano and asking us what it means to be human with songs from his forthcoming second album I Tell a Fly. Meanwhile, you may have seen Jorja Smith on the Albert Hall show, but here is Walsall's finest making her studio debut with her band, performing the new garage-flavoured track On My Mind after her 2016 anthem Blue Lights brought her to the attention of Drake and placed her on the BBC's Sound of 2017 list. The acerbic but eminently danceable LCD Soundsystem debuted on Later in 2007. Since then, James Murphy's Brooklyn-based group have split up and reformed, but now they are back with songs from their fourth album, the chart-topping American Dream. The self-possessed and quietly powerful New Zealand singer-songwriter Nadia Reid performs one of the songs from her second album Preservation, which all seems to quietly nail a moment that profoundly matters without sentimentality or fuss. Also joining Jools at the piano is Canadian singer-songwriter Elise LeGrow, who performs her stripped-down rendition of the Chuck Berry classic You Never Can Tell. This number features on her upcoming album Playing Chess, a collection of song\n\nJoining Jools for this week's musical merry-go-round are Brooklyn's The National, who made their debut on the show back in 2005 and have just scored their first number one album with their seventh collection Sleep Well Beast, with songs like Day I Die and The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness, that find the band tackling oncoming middle age and the state of the world with their customary inventive melancholy. Morrissey appeared on Later's first series back in 1992 and returns for the sixth time with songs like Spent the Day in Bed from Low in High School, his eleventh studio album and his first in three years. The album was produced by Joe Chiccarelli, who has worked with everyone from Frank Zappa to Beck. Queens of the Stone Age recently scored a number one UK album with their swaggering seventh studio album Villains, and frontman Josh Homme is in crooning mode to offer a unique performance of the closing track, Villains of Circumstance, accompanied by a string quartet and bandmate Dean Fertita. Alongside these veterans, prepare to meet 19-year-old American pop R&B singer Khalid and his breakout anthem Young Dumb and Broke from his debut album American Teen. Then make way for the returning Jessie Ware and songs from her third album Glasshouse, which adds a confessional, noir-ish feel to her 80s-influenced soul stylings on songs like Midnight and Selfish Love. Last but not least, please welcome the inventive keeper of classic country's flame, Marty Stuart, who started out as a 13-year-old with bluegrass legend Lester Flatt and is touring the UK to promote his album Way out West with his band The Fabulous Superlatives. They are performing acoustically in the high lonesome tradition of close harmony.\n\nJools Holland and his magic fingers unite a unique cast in a single room for one night only, new and older artists playing completely live! Who'd have thought it? Seven years after their last album and 20 years on from their debut, the anthemic Snow Patrol are back in business with songs from their seventh studio album Wildness, that finds frontman and songwriter Gary Lightbody wrestling with the light and the dark with edge, drama and that familiar melodic flair. Step forward south London's Shame, hot after a national tour which is surely pushing them towards becoming the most exciting British guitar band since the emergence of Arctic Monkeys and they perform songs from their debut album Songs of Praise, released in January, including the rabble rousing One Rizla.

She performs a Bob Dylan song from her album of Dylan covers Things Have Changed, accompanied by Jools. Plan B or Ben Drew performs songs from his fourth album since his debut back in 2006, Heaven Before All Hell Breaks Loose, that mixes soul and ragga influences in a vital stew.

Also adding to the Welsh flavour of proceedings is the TV debut of Cardiff four piece Boy Azooga, led by Davey Newington, whose influences include Black Sabbath and William Onyeabor. They showcase songs from their upcoming 1, 2 Kung Fu album. Also from Cardiff and making her TV debut is singer-songwriter Gwenno, who sits on the descriptive scale as a cross between Jane Birkin and Boards of Canada. Her new album Le Kov sees her singing in Cornish, which she was inspired to record due to a decision by the British government to cut funding towards the Cornish language in 2016. Another debutante comes in the form of Canadian singer-songwriter and guitarist of Haitian descent Melissa Laveaux, whose music has been described as a mix of roots, folk, and blues using her signature percussive finger-style guitar and soulful vocal stylings.

Florence Welch comes to the studio some three years after conquering the world, breaking her foot and headlining Glastonbury, with the fourth Florence + The Machine album High As Hope, which finds her in typically expansive form on new songs including Hunger and Sky Full of Song. Femi Kuti brings his afrobeat band The Positive Force live and direct from Lagos with massed brass, energetic dancers and uplifting anthems from his latest album One People One World, which maintains and honours the political consciousness and danceability of his legendary father Fela Kuti's vision.

Introducing LA's Starcrawler - a primal teenage garage band from the West Coast performing songs from their Ryan Adams-produced and self-titled album which finds lead singer Arrow de Wilde and guitarist Henri Cash kicking up a classic rock n roll storm that's a canny blend of rock classicism and bratty teenage attitude.\n\nStepping back into the spotlight in Jools's cercle de reves is the queen of fancy footwork and French pop powerhouse Heloise Letissier, aka Christine & The Queens, to perform her new single Girlfriend, an 80s-inspired funk jam from her much-anticipated second album. Making his debut on the show is jazz saxophonist and band leader Kamasi Washington, who has played with the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Herbie Hancock and whose thrilling melodic take on funk, hip-hop and even movie soundtracks with an early 70s vibe is the talk of the town.

Other artists set to perform during the series include Muse, Ju\n\nJoining Jools on the second show of this series are Devon stadium rockers Muse, who return to the show three years after their global chart-topping album Drones, with songs from their upcoming release Simulation Theory, an LA-recorded science fiction based affair featuring production from Rich Costey and Timbaland. Making her TV debut on the show is Southampton-born, now London-based Laurel, who first caught attention with a series of chamber-pop EPs and mixtapes recorded solely in her bedroom. She performs a couple of tracks from her recently released full-length debut Dogviolet. Also on the show is New Orleans-based R&B and funk musician Jon Cleary, who was born not far from the Maidstone studios in neighbouring Cranbrook, and has worked with legends such as Dr John, BB King and Bonnie Raitt. He plays a couple of selections from his new Dyna-mite album. Making a welcome return to the studio is Michigan-born, now Iceland-based singer John Grant, who performs tracks from his upcoming fourth album Love Is Magic. Completing the line-up are two debut performances - Leicester's self-proclaimed 'best band ever' Easy Life, who all met at school two years ago and have since made waves with what the NME call 'the middle ground of hip-hop, indie and slacker-rock', and 19-year-old Londoner R&B soul singer Hamzaa, whose voice has been described as 'an intoxicating blend of old-soul sapience with a sensual edge'.\n\nJoining Jools on the fourth show of this series are five artists, all returning in triumph following debuts at earlier points in their now burgeoning careers. Norwegian singer and pop star Sigrid made her UK TV debut on the show in May 2017 with Don't Kill My Vibe at the piano and has since gone on to win the BBC Music Sound of 2018 accolade, enjoy a top ten hit with her track Strangers and become a must-see on the festival circuit. Now, to top it all, she returns to perform a new number or two with her band. No stranger to the show, or indeed our cultural life of the last 40 years, Paul Weller returns to perform in an acoustic vein with just regular cohort Steve Craddock and a string quartet. Paul and co are in the middle of the studio floor with a track from his recently released 14th solo album True Meanings, a collection of dreamily autumnal, wistful, even melancholy songs. Nigerian-born and London-based singer Jacob Banks made an impressive debut on the show back in 2013 and has gone on to captivate audiences around the world with his soulful voice and songs. Following a series of EPs, he is finally releasing his debut full-length album in November and on his return to the show performs a track at the piano with Jools. Dublin's indie folk outfit Villagers made their debut on the show back in 2010 just before the release of their much-acclaimed and Mercury Prize-nominated debut Becoming a Jackal. Lead by singer-songwriter Conor O'Brien, who recently collaborated with Paul Weller on his album, they return to the show with songs from their fifth album The Art of Pretending to Swim, which has been described as their most ambitious record to date. New York State-born blues-rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa opened for BB King a number of times in the late 80s when he was 12 years old and knows a thing or two about the blues with the likes of Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton greatly inspiring him. He debuted on Later... back in 2009 and has gone on to amass Grammy\n\nJoining Jools in the theatre of dreams this week are New York modern rockers Interpol, premiering songs from Marauder, their sixth album, which expands on their iconic, menacing sound with some warmer colours on singles such as The Rover and If You Really Love Nothing. Manchester MC and grime star Bugzy Malone will be accompanied by Rag 'n' Bone Man on their contemporary anthem Run from Bugzy's top ten debut long player B Inspired. Introducing Oakland, California's eccentric bluesman Fantastic Negrito, with a song from his second album Please Don't Be Dead which confirms the mid-life flowering of his talent. London-based expansive guitar band Another Sky emerge from their shadowy beginnings to show off their compelling guitar figures, and the extraordinary vocals of singer Catrin Vincent. Also on the show is Malian star Fatoumata Diawara, who returns to the show with her four-piece band and songs from her second album Fenfo (Something to Say). The album showcases her particular brand of Afrofuturism, which sits squarely between the ancient and the modern with its mix of up-tempo blend of rock, pop and Afrobeat. Plus a swift return for Soft Cell frontman and solo star Marc Almond, who collaborates with Jools on a song they have written together. Completing the line-up is classically trained British folk singer Olivia Chaney, who over the years has collaborated with the likes of Robert Plant, The Decemberists, Eliza and Martin Carthy, to name a few. She performs a number or two, including the hauntingly beautiful title track Shelter from her latest solo offering written in her family cottage in the hills of the North Yorkshire moors.\n\nJoining Jools on the final show of this run are south London's Jungle, the soul/funk collective formed around the nucleus of childhood friends Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson. They perform a couple of tracks from their recently released second album For Ever. The supergroup comprising of Paul Simonon, Tony Allen, Simon Tong and Damon Albarn, The Good, the Bad & the Queen, make a welcome return almost 12 years on from their self-titled debut album with songs from their long-awaited follow-up.
