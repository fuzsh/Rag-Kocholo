        "text": "The second of two BA Acting performances at the Royal & Derngate saw a production of The Sweet Science of Bruising by Joy Wilkinson. The play tells the tale of the much earlier world of women's boxing than most would realise. Set back in the 1860s, Charlie Sharp, known in the boxing world as The Professor is what we know more now as a boxing promoter, but he likes to think he is a little more scientific as he takes four ladies from different worlds and makes them the \"Lady Boxing Champion of the World\".\n\nRichard Akindele is excellent as The Professor, both a character in the play driving the progression of the story, but also embodying as a narrator of the piece. He has the presence and gravitas for the role and stirs his crowd around his protégé.\n\nThe roles of the four boxers are played in no particular order by Sophie Lawlor as Violet Hunter, Sasha Wallett as Polly Stokes, Millie Metcalfe as Matty and Sadie Douglas as Anna. Each is tremendous, playing very different characters, but perhaps seeking the same thing in different ways, recognition.\n\nLawlor's Violet wants to be a nurse and finds herself, perhaps initially, unwittingly in the world of boxing and enacting the complete opposite of what she would be career-wise should be doing. Within this, you can see the tortuous decisions within Lawlor's performance, however, also, eventually, the thrill she also gets from it. Wallett as Stokes is superb, the one coming much more from the world of boxing, already in the chase of fame from it, alongside her \"brother\" Paul (a stunningly subtle performance by Jorin Beaumont). Wallett while she is apparently small in stature presents a powerhouse in the ring. It really is a cracking performance from Wallett. Metcalfe is equally fine as good-time girl Matty, a suitably larger-than-life performance, but also made devastatingly sad by Metcalfe as her desperation in her life ebbs through the story. Finally of the fighters, we have the \"Angel of Death\" Anna played with dignity by Douglas. Trapped in a brutal marriage under the domination of her controlling husband Gabriel. She seeks release and recognition in the ring.\n\nElsewhere away from the contenders, there is a remarkable performance from Ben Lole as Gabriel, very different from his comic Flash Festival role, and showing tremendous depth to his ability.\n\nThe brutal world of boxing is brilliantly presented with an incredible collection of stage combat both in the ring and beyond. Indeed, so, realistic it was, a lady next to me in the audience during Gabriel's comeuppance was literally reacting physically and emotionally to every blow. It was all so brilliantly realised.\n\nThe Sweet Science of Bruising is both a fascinating play and a compelling one to be seen on the stage due to its rare nature of boxing as a theme. The performances were superb across the board and a true knockout in many ways.\n\nHighly compelling performances and often brutal staging make this a belter of a play.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nPerformance reviewed: Saturday 18th May 2024 at the Royal & Derngate (Royal), Northampton.\n\nThe Sweet Science of Bruising was on stage at Royal & Derngate from Thursday 16th May to Saturday 18th May 2024.\n\nFor further details about the Royal & Derngate and to book tickets see their website at http://www.royalandderngate.co.uk\n\nWhen looking at the prospect of the Fringe performance Working For The Man , it is slightly difficult to work out who is the bravest person involved in this remarkable one performer, one audience member show set totally within or around the edges of a car. I guess I would in my case, say myself, but it takes some daring for performer Ellie Lomas of Naked Truth Theatre to also create a piece that offers the boldness that it does. Working for the Man is perhaps unsurprisingly about the sex trade, and explores exploitation and how, or if, prostitution is taken as a serious profession. It involves no live audio dialogue from performer Ellie Lomas, instead, she inhabits a purely physical performance, that is progressed by the use of a pair of headphones which you are given at the start. Across this audio are instructions of what to do. \"Get in the car\", \"sit in the middle seat in the back\", \"open the glove compartment\" etc, as you move to different areas\n\nI arrived at Milton Keynes Theatre to see this touring stage version of ITV comedy hit Benidorm with a distinct lack of knowledge. Having never seen the show, my information stretched as far as knowing it was set in a holiday resort in Spain (the title helps there), and that the humour generally resorted to the cruder end of the spectrum. However, having graced the screens for ten years, it was clear that Derren Litten's show had garnered quite a following, and indeed it was clear from the reception of the audience on the night, that this following was pretty much filling the theatre. The plot, such as it is for this stage show, is very much drafted from an episode of Fawlty Towers , and made a great deal more adult with its humour. The hotel manager, Joyce Temple-Savage (a sharp performance by Sherrie Hewson) gets wind that a hotel inspector is in, and the scene is set for seeking them out and all the obvious cases of mistaken identity. It's thin and doesn't fill"
