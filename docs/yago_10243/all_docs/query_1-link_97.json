        "text": "\"South Africa hosted the FIFA World Cup this year, but the pride and euphoria surged all the way up the continent. All Africans, especially young ones, embraced the spirit of the game with every new success in the stadiums. Filmmakers leapt at the occasion to showcase dozens of inspiring stories from a continent often beset by bad news. This year’s Festival sees a small collection of uplifting films set in contemporary Africa, but only one grants the World Cup a central role. It begins in Rwanda. Dudu (Eriya Ndayambaje) is a boy with boundless energy and a beaming smile. Resourceful in the way of kids who’ve always had to make do, he has a dazzling knack for finding fun in any situation. Introduced in his slum neighbourhood, Dudu demonstrates how to make a soccer ball from an inflated condom, some twine and a stray plastic bag. His playmates on the field include the middle-class Fabrice (Roger Nsengiyumva), who excels at the game, although his mother would prefer he devote more time to his studies. But these kids are soccer mad and in the year when the World Cup seems so close, they can’t resist trying to get near the action and see all the excitement for themselves. They set out (by foot!) to travel from Rwanda to South Africa. The journey is a staggering five-thousand-odd kilometres. Africa United is a joyous road movie through places where there aren’t always roads. Director Debs Gardner-Paterson gives these kids lots of adventures along the way, both light-hearted and serious. It turns out that, for all his jokes, Dudu is living with a secret that may force the boy to confront his mortality all too soon. But as they cross border after border on the way to South Africa, the kids gather new friends who can help them face all the obstacles in their collective path.\" Quoting Cameron Bailey from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.\n\nAmong Giants is a 1998 British film directed by Sam Miller, and written by Simon Beaufoy, fresh from his success with The Full Monty. It is set in Yorkshire, and stars Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Griffiths and James Thornton. The plot came about after Beaufoy was refused permission to make a documentary on electricity pylon painters in Pembrokeshire, and converted the idea into fiction. The script predates that of The Full Monty, but only found a producer in the wake of the earlier film's success. The practicalities of shooting atop electricity pylons, not to mention insurance difficulties, meant that a safer mock-up pylon was made for the actors. This proved unconvincing: Postlethwaite remarked that \"I don't believe we are up there, and if you don't sell that shot you don't sell the rest of the pylons,\" and so some material was re-shot on real pylons after training from Electricity Board climbing experts. Around the time of the film's release, the Bedford van converted for use as a camper van—dubbed \"the shagging wagon\" in the film—was stolen and burnt out in Sheffield."
