What looked like a breather for the Clippers got a little more problematic as they approached game tonight.

They might be playing the Charlotte Bobcats (13-43), the team with the NBA’s worst record, but the Clippers (40-18) were scrambling with the loss of two, if not three, regulars for a game that will be broadcast on Prime Ticket.

Guard Jamal Crawford’s fiancee gave birth to their daughter on Monday and Crawford was not available. He will rejoin the club when it travels to Indianapolis for

Thursday’s game against the Pacers.

Guard Eric Bledsoe will also be held out of the game with a sore left calf, an injury he picked up last Thursday against San Antonio. Coacgh Vinny Del Negro said

Bledsoe’s status is day-to-day. In addition, reserve forward Grant Hill is struggling with a sore back.

The adjustments Del Negro could make will be increasing Chauncey Billups’ playing time. Willie Green, a starting guard until Billups came back to crack the starting

lineup, will likely see more action.

But most importantly for the Clippers: “We have to worry about ourselves and not other teams’ records,” Del Negro said.
