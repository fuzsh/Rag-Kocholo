        "text": "The fact that NBA owners and the Players Association returned to the bargaining table for the first time in eight days was encouraging, but doom and gloom was the tone of tweets coming from various writers on hand in New York City waiting to hear from the two sides at some point Saturday night.\n\nThere were some new faces in attendance, including Michael Jordan, majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats; Paul Allen of the Portland Trailblazers, and on the players side, Chauncey Billups of the New York Knicks.\n\nJordan is believed to be the leader of a group of owners (10-14 in all) who believe the players should get no more then 50 percent of the Basketball Related Income. The irony in Jordan taking his current stance is that during the last NBA lockout in 1998, he was still playing in the league. In the middle of a bargaining session he said to Abe Pollin, former owner of the Washington Wizards, If you cant make a profit then sell your team.\n\nThirteen years later his franchise is losing money and he wants to limit the money todays players make. Interesting.\n\nWhile the 21st meeting during this lockout began, Dwyane Wade, of the Miami Heat, landed in Sydney, Australia, and on his Twitter account he mentioned he was wearing his Jordan sweat suit. Will Wade continue to wear anything with the Jordan logo when he hears of MJs line in the sand?\n\nSaturday was the 128th day of this lockout. Commissioner David Stern has canceled all games scheduled for November, which is 202 in all.\n\nMediator George Cohen did not participate in the three bargaining sessions that took place at the end of October, but he was back on Saturday after calling both sides earlier this week.\n\nTalks broke off last Friday when the owners offered a 50-50 split of the BRI and the NBPA refused to move off their number of 52.5 percent.\n\nJust as the owners have some hardliners, so too do the players. Fifty players participated in multiple conference calls with an antitrust lawyer this week, educating themselves on decertification of their union. In order to dissolve the union, 30 percent of the players would have to vote in favor of decertifying and then with the National Labor Relations Board presiding, the players would vote with decertification happening if more then half the players voted for it.\n\nThirty percent of the league's population is 130 players."
