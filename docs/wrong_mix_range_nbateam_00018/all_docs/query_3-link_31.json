        "text": "DENVER - Carmelo Anthony scored 19 points in his first game back from a broken right hand, lifting the Denver Nuggets to a 110-99 win over the Charlotte Bobcats on Friday night.\n\nNene had 22 points, hitting 10 of 11 shots, and 12 rebounds, his 14th double-double of the season. Linas Kleiza chipped in 21 points.\n\nAnthony wasn't bothered by a broken bone in his shooting hand, finishing 5-of-12 from the floor and 9-of-11 from the free throw line. He played with his two middle fingers wrapped in white athletic tape, per doctor's orders. The Nuggets forward was injured on Jan. 5 when Indiana Pacers center Jeff Foster swatted at the ball. Anthony sat out 10 games.\n\nThe Nuggets went 6-4 in his Anthony's absence.\n\nShortly after being cleared to play Thursday, Anthony received the news he'd been snubbed from the All-Star team.\n\nThe Nuggets will be represented by Chauncey Billups, who will be making his fourth straight appearance after being named a Western Conference reserve.\n\nBillups finished with 12 points and six assists against Charlotte.\n\nRaja Bell led the Bobcats with a season-high 27 points, while Boris Diaw added 16 and former Nuggets player Juwan Howard had 11.\n\nNene continues his run of torrid shooting, hitting eight straight before finally missing a layup late in the third quarter.\n\nThe Brazilian forward ranks among the best in the league in field goal percentage this season. He hit all 12 shots he attempted against Utah last Sunday, tying a team record for the most makes without a miss. The Nuggets led by as many as 20 points in the fourth quarter, before removing their regulars and coasting to their fourth win in five games.\n\nDenver is now 4-1 all-time against Charlotte at home.\n\nBobcats coach Larry Brown enjoys his jaunts back to the Mile High City, where he used to coach the Nuggets in the '70s while they were in the ABA, then the NBA. His 251 wins is still second on Denver's all-time coaching list.\n\nHowever, Brown hasn't fared well this season against teams he used to coach, dropping to 4-10.\n\nBobcats forward Gerald Wallace was released from a Los Angeles hospital after being treated for a partially collapsed lung he sustained on a flagrant foul against the Lakers earlier this week.\n\nWallace was driving down the lane, going in for a shot, when he took an elbow from Andrew Bynum, causing Wallace to fall to the floor in pain. He also fractured a rib.\n\nThe Bobcats forward is scheduled to meet with a specialist on Monday, who will decide when he can travel back to Charlotte.\n\n''We know he's doing better. But we're still waiting,'' Brown said before the game.\n\nNOTES: Charlotte F Sean May missed the game with a right knee injury after an MRI revealed some swelling. ''He was having a little discomfort,'' Brown explained. May sat out last season after having microfracture surgery. He's played in 16 games this season. … Bobcats F Cartier Martin played his first career game, scoring six points in 9:27. … Charlotte finished January with an 8-7 mark, just the fifth winning month in franchise history.\n\nNuggets 110, 'Cats 99\n\nCHARLOTTE (99)\n\nMorrison 2-5 0-0 5, Diaw 6-14 2-2 16, Okafor 4-6 2-2 10, Felton 3-10 2-3 9, Bell 9-14 6-7 27, Howard 4-10 3-4 11, Diop 2-4 1-2 5, Brown 2-7 0-1 4, C.Martin 2-5 0-0 6, Singletary 0-0 2-2 2, Ajinca 1-2 2-4 4.
