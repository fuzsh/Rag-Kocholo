        "text": "Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups had no intentions of watching the game video to examine and relive Sunday night’s abysmal 93-80 loss to the Charlotte Hornets at the Moda Center.\n\nA loss that saw the Blazers go 3 of 32 on three-point shots\n\n“I don’t wanna just look at them bad misses again,” he said. “That does nothing for me.”\n\nAnfernee Simons, who went 0 of 8 on threes, had the same view of the situation.\n\n“I pretty much know exactly what happened in that game,” Simons said with a smile. “I know every shot I missed. I know every turnover I had. I can remember it all.”\n\nHaving a short memory in these situations is a must. This was the type of loss, Billups and Simons said, that can’t exactly be explained beyond stating the obvious. It was just one of those nights when the ball seemingly refused to go into the hoop.\n\nPart of the credit for that should go to Charlotte, which over its last six games leads the NBA in defensive rating (100.3). But Billups said he was happy with the shots his team generated and was especially proud of how the defense kept the Blazers in the game. Plus, the team’s work ethic could be found in the 22 offensive rebounds that led to 21 second-chance points.\n\nBut the shooting? Well, only center Deandre Ayton, who scored 26 points with 19 rebounds while shooting 10 of 16 from the field truly had his touch going.\n\n“It wasn’t just like we couldn’t make threes, we couldn’t make anything other than DA, you know,” Billups said. “We couldn’t make layups. We couldn’t catch a pass. It was just ugly.”\n\nSometimes, Billups said, there is nothing a team can do to combat bad luck.\n\n“I told our guys at halftime, ‘If there’s one thing in our league that you can never control, it’s that the ball is going to go into the hole,’” Billups said.\n\nPortland (15-41) shot just 34.7% from the field while hitting just 9.4% on threes.\n\nAnfernee Simons had one of the worst performances of his career. He shot 4 of 21 from the field to finish with 10 points.\n\nThe Blazers’ 34 points in the first half matched their season low of 34 scored in the second half of their 108-102 loss at the Milwaukee Bucks on Nov. 26.\n\nThe Blazers’ fewest made threes entering the night was four. Their lowest three-point shooting percentage had been 18.2% (6 of 33) against the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 28.\n\nPortland’s 80 points is its second fewest this season, behind that dreadful night on Jan. 11 when they lost 139-77 at the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“It was just an ugly night offensively,” Billups said.\n\nUgly night? Yes. But the recipe for such horrific nights certainly exists.\n\nPortland ranks 29th in scoring (107.4 points per game), last in field goal percentage (43.8%), 28th in three-point shooting (34.8%) and last in true shooting (54.1%).\n\nThey faced the Hornets without three of their top-five scorers: Shaedon Sharpe, Malcolm Brogdon and Scoot Henderson.\n\nThat forced the Blazers to turn to a mostly young group of players not yet capable of being reliable shooters in high-level situations. Most teams would gladly allow Matisse Thybulle (34% on threes), Dalano Banton (33%), Toumani Camara (29.9%) Jabari Walker (26.7%) and Kris Murray (28.4%) to shoot as many threes as they would like.\n\nOn Sunday, they combined to go 0 of 14 from beyond the arc. And that came on a night when the team’s best two scorers, Simons and Grant, combined to go 1 of 14 on threes. When that happens, others must pick up the slack and the best two players on the roster to do so, Brogdon and Sharpe, were out.\n\nSimons became clearly frustrated at times during the game but said he thought he handled that better than he did during his younger years. In the end, he recognized that it was just not his night.\n\n“You’re thinking about, alright, what am I doing wrong on my jump shots?” he said. “Or, what are we doing wrong as a team? We’re getting good looks. We missed some bunny layups. Some wide-open threes.”\n\nSimons left the locker room with a smile on his face. Others did too. Overanalyzing and dwelling on the situation, Simons said, doesn’t help.\n\n“That can carry on to the next game and you don’t want it to carry on, especially when you feel like you got good shots,” he said.\n\nLatest Blazers news\n\nTrail Blazers summer league review: Donovan Clingan shined while others fizzled\n\nTrail Blazers’ Donovan Clingan named second-team All-Summer League\n\nBlazer Focused podcast: Trail Blazers summer league report card\n\nTrail Blazers end summer league with win over Houston Rockets\n\nPortland Trail Blazers vs. Houston Rockets: Game preview, time, TV channel, how to watch free live stream online\n\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\n\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE"
