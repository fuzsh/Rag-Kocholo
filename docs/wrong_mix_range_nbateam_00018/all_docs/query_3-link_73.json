        "text": "Maybe I should leave the photoshopping to Tony.psd.\n\nOne could easily argue that the Detroit Pistons had one of the busiest offseasons. They're making more moves than Ford Motors! Actually, I take that back...I shouldn't make jokes about the dying American car industry...\n\nWith two of the most expensive free agents added to the Pistons roster this year, are they going to be able to break into the top 5 in the East?\n\nJump for some more thoughts.\n\nOffseason Additions\n\nVIA DRAFT\n\nAustin Daye (No. 15)\n\nDaJuan Summers (No. 35)\n\nJonas Jerebko (No. 39)\n\nVIA FREE AGENCY\n\nBen Gordon (from Bulls)\n\nCharlie Villanueva (from Bucks)\n\nBen Wallace (from Suns)\n\nChris Wilcox (from Knicks)\n\nOffseason Subtractions\n\nVIA FREE AGENCY\n\nRasheed Wallace (to Celtics)\n\nVIA TRADE\n\nArron Afflalo (to Nuggets)\n\nAmir Johnson (to Bucks)\n\nWalter Sharpe (to Nuggets)\n\nRENOUNCED\n\nAllen Iverson\n\nAntonio McDyess (to Spurs)\n\nWalter Herrmann\n\nWAIVED\n\nFabricio Oberto\n\nWoooooowwwww. That's some crazy ish for Joe Dumars to be pulling in a city that can barely take care of its own people. I know, I shouldn't rag on Detroit and its financial problems, but I feel a sort of connection to the city now - more on that later.\n\nRewinding 2k8-2k9 Season: 39-43\n\nFor some odd reason, Joe Dumars thought practice wasn't important so he traded Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson.\n\nIt unfortunately did not answer much.\n\nA.I. never really found his role on the Pistons, ended up becoming the 6th man, developed \"back problems' at the end of the season and rarely played. The Pistons ended their season as the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference and had a quick 1st round exit to the Cavaliers.\n\nProjecting 2k9-2k10 Season: 41-41\n\nQ: What happens when you sign Ben Gordon for 5 years at $55 million and Charlie V. for 5 years at $35 million?\n\nA: You don't win very much.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Ben Gordon was huge in the Bulls-Celtics series. He's a great shooter and can turn on his Pistons (get it?) at any given point. Awesome offensive power and the man you want for that last minute three.\n\nBut that's about it. As Warriors fans, we know all about volume shooters (see: Jamal Crawford) and know the problems with running your team through that. $11 mil a year? That's a lot to dedicate to a one-dimensional player. Again, we know all about that as Warriors fans (see: Corey Maggette.)\n\nAs for Charlie Villanueva, as much as I love following him on Twitter, I don't like following his game on the court. He's got talent, but not enough to justify that new contract. He's basically another Al Harrington, so ask yourself, would you pay big Al $7 mil a year?\n\nMy review about Joe Dumars this offseason?\n\nGO JOE?\n\nNO JOE.\n\nR Dizzle's Predictions\n\nThe Detroit Pistons end up 8th Place in the Eastern Conference\n\nGet swept by the Cavaliers (again?!?)\n\nEric Gordon averages 25 points and 5 assists\n\nJoe Dumars publicly admits trading Chauncey Billups was a mistake"
