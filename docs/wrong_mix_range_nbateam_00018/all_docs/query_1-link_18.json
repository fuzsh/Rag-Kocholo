        "meta_description": "Few athletes resonate on the Denver sports scene quite the way Chauncey Billups did. He’s as Colorado as it gets. Grew up in Park Hill. Attended George Washington High School. Starred at the University of Colorado. And he had a profound impact on the Nuggets. Getting there was a two-part experience. Billups’ first stint with the Nuggets was short and full of learning, being with the team for 58 games over two seasons in 1999 and 2000. The second stint? Well, that was plain magical.",
