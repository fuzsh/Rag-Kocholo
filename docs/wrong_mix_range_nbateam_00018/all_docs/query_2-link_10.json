        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Chauncey Billups played in his first Big3 event Sunday, the second of 10 weeks the 3-on-3 event will be played in cities across the country.\n\nThe first week? He missed that one for another job opportunity that he’s still “pondering.”\n\nBillups said Sunday there’s “no new news” on whether he will accept a position as president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers, but there should be soon.\n\n“I’m still in the process of thinking it over,” he said. “That will probably be done at some point in the next few days, but nothing to report.”\n\nMore:\n\nBillups said he opted to skip last week’s premiere Big3 event in Brooklyn because he didn’t want to distract from the debut of Ice Cube’s new league.\n\n“The whole Cleveland thing just kind of jumped off,” Billups said. “I didn’t really want to take away from the first game, the first-ever professional Big 3 3-on-3 game, and (have) everybody want to talk just about Cleveland. I, of course, wanted to play. But I didn’t want to take away from the event.”\n\nBillups, who has worked as an NBA analyst for ESPN since 2014-15, reportedly was offered the Cavaliers position June 22.\n\n“I love my job at ESPN It’s so much fun, man, to talk the game and try to share the game, try to teach the viewers,” he said. “That’s been great. I’ve always said me running a team at some point was another one of my desires. So, if this thing with Cleveland goes down, great. If it doesn’t, great. At some point, I’m going to do that. We’ll see what happens after that.”"
