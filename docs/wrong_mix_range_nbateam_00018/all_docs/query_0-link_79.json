        "text": "The biggest blowout in postseason history was won on the road. In 2009’s Round 1, the Denver Nuggets beat the daylights out of the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans) by almost as many points as the Hornets scored (a 58-point differential in a 121-63 contest).\n\nThat’s all not entirely true, actually. If you check the biggest overall trouncings in NBA playoff history (home or away), you’ll see there was another 58-point win for the home Minneapolis Lakers back in 1956. So, really, it’s a tie.\n\nBut then the third biggest beatdown in postseason history was also handed to a home team. In 1973, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors by 56 in Oakland.\n\nThus, the Lakers (as Minneapolis and L.A.) own two of the three biggest playoff blowouts ever, one home and one away.\n\nHanding out a spanking in someone else’s house is a good indicator of who the better team really is in the end. Of the 21 blowouts below, the winner went on to the next round 16 times (76.2 percent of the time).\n\nNone of these actually occurred in the NBA Finals themselves. For the 20 biggest blowouts in the championship series (they are all home games, every one), click here.\n\nThanks again to basketball-reference.com, where I punched this query into their play index tool to come up with every road playoff win of 20 points or more.\n\nFollow @VinGetz\n\nPOINT DIFF.
