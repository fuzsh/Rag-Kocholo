        "text": "DETROIT – The Detroit Pistons worked the phones last summer, trying to trade for a superstar to shake up their roster.\n\nThey ended up standing pat because a deal didn’t make sense.\n\nTwo games into the season, Allen Iverson was the answer to their hopes in a blockbuster trade that generated rare buzz for the NBA in November.\n\nDetroit acquired the former NBA MVP on Monday for All-Star point guard and former Finals MVP Chauncey Billups, top reserve Antonio McDyess and project Cheikh Samb.\n\n“We just felt it was the right time to change our team,” Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press. “Iverson gives us a dimension that we haven’t had here and we really think it’s going to help us.”\n\nThe Pistons have reached six straight Eastern Conference finals – the longest such streak since the Lakers’ dominant run in the 1980s – and won the 2004 title without a player expected to be in the Hall of Fame.\n\nDumars said the Nuggets first contacted him Thursday with a proposal that included Iverson. Dumars, who had become concerned the Pistons were set in their ways, struck a deal at 1:45 Monday morning.\n\n“It gives us a different way to attack people,” Dumars said. “We have been extremely successful for a long time. But I also think what comes with that is a little bit of predictability.”\n\nIverson may not be around for long – making $20.8 million in the final season of his contract – but The Answer might be what Detroit needs to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2005.\n\nThe Pistons are hoping Iverson will play Wednesday at Toronto and barring injury, his home debut will be Sunday night against the Boston Celtics.\n\nDetroit played Monday night at Charlotte, where the Bobcats are led by Coach Larry Brown. The Hall of Fame coach helped Billups and the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and guided the Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers to a spot in the Finals in 2001.\n\n“Trading Marilyn Monroe for Jane Russell. That’s not bad,” Brown said. “Joe knows what he’s doing, and I’m happy Chauncey’s going back to Denver and his family is there.”\n\nIverson talked about the possibility of being traded during training camp and said the only negative would be uprooting his family again.\n\n“But it doesn’t bother me because basketball is basketball,” Iverson said during camp. “It won’t change my game because I only know one way to play and that’s like every game is my last.”\n\nBillups is a Denver native, former Colorado star and former Nugget.\n\nMcDyess also will be enjoying a homecoming of sorts, landing on the Nuggets roster for the third time.\n\nThe Pistons kept McDyess off the free-agent market last summer by giving him a $13.5 million, two-year extension, and they would love to have him back if the cost-cutting Nuggets buy out his contract.\n\nBillups is in the second season of a four-year contract worth a guaranteed $46 million with a $14 million team option for a fifth year.\n\nAlthough resigning Iverson won’t be easy, the Pistons solidified their future roster shortly after the trade by agreeing to a three-year deal with guard Richard Hamilton worth about $34 million, a basketball official told AP.\n\nFinally, the blockbuster trade means the end of Juwan Howard’s short stay in Denver. With 14 players on the roster after getting three for one, the Nuggets waived Howard, their only player with a non-guaranteed contract."
