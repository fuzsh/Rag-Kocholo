        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Stephen Jackson scored 23 points and the Charlotte Bobcats held off Denver 100-98 on Tuesday night to deny Nuggets coach George Karl his 1,000th NBA win.\n\nReturning to North Carolina where he played in college and going up against his longtime friend and fellow former Tar Heel Larry Brown, Karl had hoped to become the seventh coach of the 1,000-win club in Charlotte.\n\nThe Nuggets nearly rallied from eight points down with 90 seconds left, but Chauncey Billups missed a tying jumper in the corner as time expired.\n\nBillups scored 25 points and Carmelo Anthony added 22 points and seven rebounds for the Nuggets, who had won seven straight.\n\nGerald Wallace had 20 points and nine boards for Charlotte. Tyrus Thomas scored 16 before leaving left late in the fourth quarter with a tight left quadriceps.\n\nHawks 116, Nets 101\n\nATLANTA - Josh Smith scored a season-high 34 points to lead streaking Atlanta to another victory.\n\nSmith, accurate with his outside jumper and inside game, made 14 of 16 shots from the field. When it was over, he blew kisses to the crowd.\n\nThe Hawks are 4-1 since losing top scorer Joe Johnson for four to six weeks to a right elbow injury and have won seven of eight overall.\n\nBrook Lopez led New Jersey with 24 points. Devin Harris had 18 points and 13 assists.\n\n76ers 117, Cavaliers 97\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Thaddeus Young had a season-high 26 points and the 76ers picked up their fourth win in five games.\n\nLou Williams scored 13 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter for Philadelphia, which placed seven players in double figures in its highest scoring output of the season. Jodie Meeks and Jrue Holiday had 16 points apiece, Andre Iguodala scored 13 and Elton Brand finished with 12.\n\nJ.J. Hickson had 18 points for Cleveland, which has lost five consecutive games ."
