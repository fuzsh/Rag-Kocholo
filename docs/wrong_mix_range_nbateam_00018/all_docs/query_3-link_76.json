        "text": "Richard Hamilton scored 19 points and the Detroit Pistons concluded a wild day by beating the Charlotte Bobcats, 101-83, last night in Charlotte, N.C., ensuring Allen Iverson will join an unbeaten team.\n\nAlso, a basketball official told the Associated Press that Hamilton and the Pistons have agreed to a three-year contract extension worth about $34 million.\n\nPlaying short-handed hours after acquiring Iverson in a blockbuster deal with Denver, the balanced Pistons toyed with former coach Larry Brown’s new team, improving to 3-0 and perhaps showing Iverson that he’ll have plenty of scoring options when he takes over the point.\n\nRasheed Wallace added 15 points and four other players scored in double figures. Rodney Stuckey replaced the departed Chauncey Billups and had nine points and three assists for Detroit, which shot 50 percent.\n\nCavaliers 100, Mavericks 81 – LeBron James snapped a third-quarter tie with a flying rebound-layup, then Mo Williams broke things open early in the fourth, sending Cleveland to victory over host Dallas.\n\nJames was only 8-of-20, but scored 29 points and took over when his team needed it. The Cavs ended the third quarter ahead by six, then Williams scored nine points during a 13-0 run at the start of the final period.\n\nDirk Nowitzki was held to eight points on 3-of-11 shooting as the Mavericks fell to 0-2 at home. Josh Howard led the Mavs with 18 points.\n\n76ers 125, Kings 91 – Thaddeus Young scored 18 points, Lou Williams had 17 and host Philadelphia routed winless Sacramento.\n\nWillie Green scored 16 points and Elton Brand had 15 for the Sixers, who were up 20 points at halftime. Jason Thompson scored 17 points and Spencer Hawes had 15 for the Kings (0-4).\n\nMagic 96, Bulls 93 – Dwight Howard had 22 points and 15 rebounds, and host Orlando held off Chicago after Andres Nocioni’s missed 3-pointer at the buzzer.\n\nRashard Lewis finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds as the Magic wiped out an early nine-point Bulls lead and led by as many as 17. Drew Gooden led Chicago with 21 points. Nocioni added 20 and Ben Gordon 17.\n\nGrizzlies 90, Warriors 79 – Marc Gasol had 27 points and 16 rebounds to help host Memphis beat Golden State.\n\nGasol went 9-for-11 from the field and the free throw line for Memphis.\n\nElsewhere in the NBA – The Thunder waived John Lucas III after the point guard was inactive for the team’s first three games."
