        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Knicks team president Donnie Walsh last week referred to the Carmelo Anthony deal as a “monumental trade.” He did not realize the club would respond with a monumental collapse that would threaten their spot in the playoffs.\n\nAs much as Walsh was mixed on the deal, he did not foresee this disgrace — a 7-12 record since that trade.\n\nThe unthinkable is happening. The Knicks may become the 2007 Mets. They were manhandled last night by the Bobcats for their sixth straight loss — 114-106 at Time Warner Cable Arena.\n\nThe Knicks (35-38) fell behind by 20 points early in the third quarter before a late rally was snuffed out. With nine games left, the No. 7 Knicks are 4½ games in front of the ninth-place Bobcats (30-42). The Bucks (29-43) fell into 10th place after last night’s 95-87 loss to the Bulls.\n\nThe scary thing is, there isn’t a team on the rest of the Knicks’ schedule they can assuredly beat. They have lost nine of their last 10 and if they don’t win another one this season, that would make it 18 of 19 losses to finish out an historic implosion.\n\nChauncey Billups said it all afterward and owner James Dolan might want to read the quote for next time before he guts a club in midseason.\n\n“As you know, talent isn’t everything,” said Billups, who finished with 14 points and 10 assists but shot just 6 of 16, 1 of 6 from the 3-point line, disappearing in the fourth.\n\n“Camaraderie and cohesiveness beats talent every day of the week. When we get to a point where we get that, combined with the talent, we’re going to be a very dangerous team.”\n\nThe Knicks, who appear destined for their 10th straight losing season, play like they are strangers to one another. Nothing coach Mike D’Antoni tries now ever sticks.\n\nAnthony got untracked by scoring 36 points, on fire from long range, and his two back-to-back 3-pointers got the Knicks within five points midway through the fourth quarter before they went cold again.\n\n“These are teams that we should be beating,” Anthony said. “We talked about that amongst ourselves. They shouldn’t be on the court with us.”\n\nActually, teams might start saying that soon about the Knicks, who play host to Orlando tomorrow night.\n\nOf the Knicks’ nine losses in this stretch, six have come against teams with losing records.\n\nD’Antoni is searching for any positives.\n\n“There’s a little anxiety, but I think the locker room is great and they know the situation,” D’Antoni said. “Tonight was a little better. I’m more encouraged today than I was yesterday [after Friday’s loss to Milwaukee].”\n\nTo give Billups a break from guarding quick point guards, D’Antoni started Toney Douglas in the backcourt over Landry Fields and the move backfired. Douglas was an offensive wreck, starting the game 2 of 7 after seven minutes and he couldn’t keep D.J. Augustin out of the paint. Ultimately, Douglas was benched.\n\n“He had no pop whatsoever, he wasn’t staying in front of Augustin,” D’Antoni said.\n\nAmar’e Stoudemire was listless in a 4-of-13 outing for 14 points. He’s looking shot on both ends, from all the minutes this season.\n\nThe Bobcats weren’t stopped in the first half. They staged a 14-0 run the second quarter and took a 64-51 lead at halftime. The Knicks’ defense was absolutely putrid. Instead of playing desperate, they looked asleep, as if they had too much Carolina barbecue.\n\nCharlotte big man Boris Diaw got free for layups in driving to the hole like he was Bobcats owner Michael Jordan in his prime. He had 14 points at halftime, finished with 20 and did most of his damage on an inactive Stoudemire.\n\nD’Antoni got Shelden Williams in as the starting center for the second half and the Knick defense tightened.\n\nDown five, Billups missed a trey with 1:06 left and Fields missed a trey on the next possession, ending the Knicks’ bid. They were 6 of 28 from 3-point land and finished shooting 39.8 percent."
