Hear the full conversation on “No Cap Room” - part of the “Ball Don’t Lie” podcast - and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nChris Mannis put out something from Sports Illustrated on Twitter about Chauncey Billups being a name to keep an eye on Chaunce Phillips said to me in Charlotte in the pregame presser when I asked him at the end of the season in April, how he would like evaluate his two years.\n\nAnd what does he see for himself as a future head coach?\n\nBasically in Portland or otherwise, Chauncey Bills did not hesitate either to say that he wants to be in a winning situation and he only has one year left after this.\n\nHe said, quote, it's been a tough couple of years for us three.\n\nNow we've just had so much influx on our roster and so much bad luck with health and things like that.\n\nAnd I'm just here every day just grinding through it, helping my guys the best way I can just hoping that hoping that hopefully the next time around next year we're healthy, we're better.\n\nOur roster is ready to really, really compete because I just know personally, myself, I'm light years ahead of where I was when I took the job, obviously being a first time coach, first time head coach and I'm really ready for that challenge and that pressure to go out and compete with these best teams and stuff.\n\nI'm really ready to do that.\n\nSo I just hope that we can be in that position.\n\nThat's all.\n\nSo he said, we, he said, we, but he also said personally, he's ready to do this and I've just heard some rumblings that he could be a name to consider for Phoenix.\n\nSo I just wanted to say that into a microphone."
