        "text": "Hours after acquiring point guard Allen Iverson from the Denver Nuggets, the Detroit Pistons reportedly reached terms on a three-year contract extension with shooting guard Richard (Rip) Hamilton.\n\nAn official requesting anonymity told the Associated Press late Monday that the extension is worth $34 million US.\n\nHamilton, 30, is in the fifth season of a seven-year, $62-million US contract he signed July 17, 2003.\n\nThe three-time all-star led all scorers with 19 points and five assists in Monday's 101-83 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nDetroit is looking forward to pairing him in the backcourt with Iverson, a nine-time all-star acquired Monday in return for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb.\n\n\"It gives us a different way to attack people,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said. \"We have been extremely successful for a long time, but I also think what comes with that is a little bit of predictability.\"\n\nHamilton has averaged 17.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 33.2 minutes in 677 appearances (576 starts) over 10 NBA seasons with the Washington Wizards and the Pistons.\n\nDrafted seventh overall by the Wizards in 1999, he was traded to the Pistons, along with Hubert Davis and Bobby Simmons, for Jerry Stackhouse, Brian Cardinal and Ratko Varda on Sept. 11, 2002.\n\nHamilton won an NBA title in 2004 with Detroit, which has reached the Eastern Conference final in each of the past six seasons.\n\n\"We definitely wanted Rip in the fold as we continue to make this run,\" Pistons rookie head coach Michael Curry said. \"He is a valuable piece to the puzzle.\""
