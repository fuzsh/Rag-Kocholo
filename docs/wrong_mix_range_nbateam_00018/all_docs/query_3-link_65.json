        "text": "No matter how much the Detroit Pistons are tested, they aren't going to get rattled.\n\nThe Pistons were forced to play two overtimes on the road before beating the Memphis Grizzlies 106-104 on Monday night on Chauncey Billups' jumper with 0.3 seconds left.\n\n\"Whenever they took the lead or tied it up and got the crowd into the game, we made some plays to put the crowd out of it,\" Tayshaun Prince said. \"They would make another run, and we would respond again.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies held the Pistons to only three field goals in the fourth quarter to force overtime, and Pau Gasol twice made baskets that forced extra periods.\n\nNone of that bothered the Pistons.\n\n\"That's us. We're never rattled,\" Billups said. \"Even when we were down, we're never rattled, and we just keep our composure. That's why we're so good in those tough, grind-it-out situations.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies, who lost for the fourth time in five games, had tied the game at 104 when Damon Stoudamire made a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 4.6 seconds left. Stoudamire had nine points in the second overtime.\n\nBillups then took the inbounds pass from Prince, dribbled to the left side of the key and hit the shot to send the Pistons to their fourth straight win.\n\nBillups finished with a season-high 30 points and nine assists. He missed a potential winning shot at the end of the first overtime, but his teammates wanted him to have the ball with the game on the line.\n\n\"After Chauncey missed that shot at the end of the first overtime, I knew we had to get it back to him again because I knew he'd make up for it,\" Prince said.\n\nIn other games, it was: Toronto 92, Orlando 90; Charlotte 106, Sacramento 103 in overtime; Boston 109, Golden State 98; and Seattle 111, Washington 101.\n\nPrince added 24 points for Detroit, while Richard Hamilton scored 19. It almost wasn't enough after Memphis erased an 11-point deficit in the final 10 minutes.\n\n\"When they were making baskets in the fourth quarter, we knew it was going to be a grind-out game,\" Prince said. \"I don't think anybody should have lost. Both teams made plays down the stretch.\"\n\nGasol led the Grizzlies with 32 points and 13 rebounds, and Stoudamire added 24 points and seven assists as Detroit had one of the toughest wins of its 19-3 start.\n\n\"It wasn't the result we wanted, but if you can take something from a loss, you can definitely take something from this one,\" Stoudamire said.\n\nBobcats 106, Kings 103, OT\n\nAt Charlotte, N.C., Primoz Brezec scored five of his 26 points in overtime to help the Bobcats to a costly victory.\n\nThe Bobcats lost forward Emeka Okafor and guard Kareem Rush to injuries during the game. Okafor left with what appeared to be a seriously sprained right ankle late in the third quarter and Rush played just seven minutes before leaving with a strained left index finger.\n\nShareef Abdur-Rahim finished with 32 points to lead the Kings, who lost their third consecutive game.\n\nSuperSonics 111, Wizards 101\n\nRashard Lewis scored 30 points, eight in the final 3 minutes, and Seattle snapped a four-game home losing streak.\n\nLewis, who earlier Monday pleaded not guilty to drunken driving charges after being pulled over on Sept. 30, was 10-of-20 from the field and made all three 3-point attempts, following up a 37-point performance on Friday in Portland. Ray Allen added 24 points for the Sonics and shot 10-of-18.\n\nWashington lost its third straight and sixth in its last seven games. Gilbert Arenas scored 27 of his 30 points in the second half, the 10th time this season he has scored 30 or more.\n\nCeltics 109, Warriors 98\n\nAt Boston, Ricky Davis scored 21 points and added seven assists as the Celtics recovered from their worst loss of the season.\n\nPaul Pierce added 19 points and nine rebounds for Boston, which had lost four of its previous five games, including a 32-point loss to the Chicago Bulls on Saturday. Marcus Banks scored 16 points in his first start of the season because point guard Delonte West was scratched with dizziness.\n\nTroy Murphy had 27 points and 12 rebounds for the Warriors, who have lost five of their last seven.\n\nRaptors 92, Magic 90\n\nMorris Peterson scored 19 points, including a clinching 3-pointer with 8 seconds left, as Toronto won at Orlando to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nThe Raptors made nine 3-pointers, including one by Mike James that gave them the lead for good. Chris Bosh also scored 19 points for Toronto, which has earned four of its five wins this season on the road.\n\nSteve Francis scored 20 points and Jameer Nelson added 14 as the Magic lost for the seventh time in nine games."
