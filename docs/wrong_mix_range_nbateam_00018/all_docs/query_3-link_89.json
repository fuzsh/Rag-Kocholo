        "text": "Raymond Felton had 18 points and nine assists, Raja Bell also scored 18 points, and host Charlotte beat the undermanned Chicago last night for its season-high fourth straight victory.\n\nAfter winning the final three games on their West Coast trip, the Bobcats returned home and continued their late-season push to reach the playoffs for the first time, securing the season tiebreaker over the Bulls, who are also in a logjam for the final postseason berth in the Eastern Conference.\n\nWithout forwards Luol Deng (leg) and Tim Thomas (knee), Chicago fell behind early and never recovered. Tyrus Thomas had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the sloppy Bulls, who shot 39 percent.\n\nChicago coach Vinny Del Negro said an hour before the game that Deng would play, but not start. But Deng, injured in Saturday’s win over Houston, ruled himself out about 45 minutes later after experiencing pain in warmups.\n\nJohn Salmons got the start at small forward two weeks after being acquired from Sacramento, but he shot 4 for 13 and the Bulls quickly fell behind while struggling to defend Charlotte’s perimeter shooters.\n\nBell, who spent a long time before the game getting treatment for a sore right shoulder, shot 7 for 9 from the field in the first half. Emeka Okafor, who finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds, dominated the inside and the Bobcats built a 16-point second-quarter lead.\n\nAfter the Bulls got within 68-60 late in the third quarter, Felton hit a 3-pointer and fadeaway jumper and Boris Diaw had two buckets in an 11-2 run to put Charlotte ahead, 79-62, entering the final quarter.\n\nBen Gordon scored 14 points for Chicago, but committed five of the Bulls’ 17 turnovers.\n\nDwight Howard had 21 points and eight rebounds in a bruising battle with Shaquille O’Neal, and host Orlando beat Phoenix.\n\nRashard Lewis had 29 points and Hedo Turkoglu scored 22 for the Magic, who overcame a season-high 24 turnovers.\n\nO’Neal finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds, outmuscling his first NBA team for most of the night before he lost his cool late, again drawing boos by the Orlando crowd. His technical foul with 3:38 left contributed to nine straight points for the Magic that gave Orlando a 10-point lead to put the game out of reach.\n\nJason Richardson had 27 points, and Steve Nash added 20 points for Phoenix after missing the last three games with a sprained right ankle.\n\nStephen Jackson had 23 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists to lead visiting Golden State.\n\nCorey Maggette added 16 points and Andris Biedrins had 10 points and 13 rebounds for the Warriors, who snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\nKevin Love had 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 31 points in the first half and lost for the seventh time in a row and 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\nThe Wolves haven’t won at home since an overtime victory over Chicago on Jan. 25.\n\nChauncey Billups scored a season-high 34 points in his return to the Palace, but host Detroit came away with the victory against the Carmelo Anthony-less Nuggets.\n\nTayshaun Prince scored 23 points for the Pistons and four of his teammates scored at least 16.\n\nThe Pistons have won three straight for the first time in two months — after losing seven straight — to move a game over .500 in a season that was stunted by a trade that sent Billups to Denver for Allen Iverson.\n\nIverson missed his third straight game with a back injury.\n\nCarl Landry matched a career high with 22 points, Luis Scola added 20 points and 16 rebounds and host Houston extended its home-court winning streak to 10 games.\n\nYao Ming added 20 points and 11 rebounds for the Rockets, who moved a game ahead of New Orleans and Portland and 1 1/2 in front of Utah in the Western Conference standings. The Rockets play the Jazz in Salt Lake City tonight.\n\nChris Bosh and Andrea Bargnani scored 25 points apiece and Jose Calderon matched a career high with 16 assists for the Raptors, who’ve lost seven of their last eight road games.\n\nBrook Lopez scored 24 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Jarvis Hayes hit five 3-pointers to lift visiting New Jersey.\n\nIt was the Nets’ third win in the last four games after a five-game losing streak, but it took a while for New Jersey to find its 3-point range. After a 2-for-18 start, it hit seven of its final nine beyond the arc."
