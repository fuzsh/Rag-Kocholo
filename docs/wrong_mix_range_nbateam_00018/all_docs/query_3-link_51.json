        "text": "This week brings me to my final days with the Milwaukee Bucks. These past 6 years have been nothing but a blessing. I learned how to sell, curated a lot of transferable skills, and learned how to become a professional right out of college. Getting to work in the NBA was a dream to me and I am beyond lucky that I got to make it a reality. I want to thank Wes Warne for giving me the opportunity to become a Milwaukee Buck; believing in me and pushing me to become great! It was an honor to become a manager and sit next to the person that gave me a chance. I want to thank Kristina Filipovic for taking a risk on me to get to the next level in my career as a service rep and then making me the best well-rounded rep that I could become. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for her! I want to thank Paul Bee for helping me get to the management level and coaching me on how to become a great leader. I also want to thank my leadership team for bringing me in, really becoming family and pushing me to become a great leader. Tom LaCombe, Kristina Filipovic, Erin Simmons, Evan Myers, Matt Seu As I leave, I want to say I am beyond proud of my Sales Reps and honored that I was able to manage you all, because you all are amazing and I cannot wait to continue watching you all grow! Jacqueline Anderson, Holly Heeb, M.S., Eliza Rice, Lareal “Evonna” McGill, Zane George, Isabel Martinez Simply thank you to my entire Bucks Family #feerthedeer"
