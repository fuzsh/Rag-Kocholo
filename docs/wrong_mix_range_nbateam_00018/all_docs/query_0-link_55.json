        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The evolution has been televised.\n\n“I see that on film, I see it in the way he carried himself,” said Bobcats coach Mike Dunlap.\n\nNuggets fans have seen it too, from couches in Capitol Hill to bar stools in Boulder, during this resplendent run.\n\nDenver guard Ty Lawson, it appears, is evolving into a leader. And dare we say a star?\n\nLawson scored nine points in the fourth quarter Saturday night, helping the Nuggets defeat the Bobcats 113-99. He finished the game with 20 points, five rebounds, five assists and a plus-15 rating.\n\nIn the previous five games, the former North Carolina star averaged 27.4 points and nine assists. And in 18 games before Saturday, the little guy averaged 20.8 points and 7.7 assists.\n\nThis year, 2013, has been his year.\n\n“I just think he’s understanding the rhythm of the game,” Nuggets coach George Karl said of Lawson. “And he’s becoming more assertive in more plays. He’s got a confidence in his jumper that he didn’t have earlier in the season. And if he every got a fair whistle, he’d probably score a lot more points. I just think Ty sometimes is so strong and so quick, he gets knocked but not knocked off balance. But a foul is a foul.”\n\nKarl barked at the referees all game Saturday until one told Karl he was “done for the night” in regard to complaints. Soon after, a foul was called on Lawson and Karl sarcastically cheered, earning Karl a technical foul.\n\n“I probably deserved it,” the coach said.\n\nDenver looked fresh against the Bobcats despite playing the night before at Washington.\n\nAndre Iguodala, who had been struggling with shooting efficiency, was 5-for-7 against the Bobcats and finished with a plump stat line of 13 points, five rebounds and a game-high 10 assists.\n\nJaVale McGee, the Nuggets’ bouncy backup center, had four dunks in the first quarter. He contributed 17 points and six rebounds off the bench.\n\nIn a Karl-guided system, a team will go only as far as the point guards can take it. Karl has coached dynamic point guards such as Gary Payton, Sam Cassell and Chauncey Billups. Two months is a small sample size, but Lawson’s production appears to be more evolution than aberration.\n\n“His growth, it’s what the Nuggets do,” said Dunlap, a former Metro State coach and Nuggets assistant. “Their staff, John Welch to everybody else, and Coach Karl is the best in the league to play for in development. One of the other things is, Coach Karl has an inherent swagger to him, and with Ty, I see it in his ability to shoot the ball, even though we know he’s arguably one of the top-three penetrators in the league. …\n\n“He’s much more responsible with the ball now — a mark of improvement. And the other thing I notice is, he’s more willing to tell guys what to do and where they’re supposed to be. Before, I didn’t see that in him.”\n\nNuggets Recap\n\nWhat you might have missed\n\nPlaying with a recovering left thigh bruise, Denver forward Danilo Gallinari only played 15 minutes, finishing with six points on 2-for-3 shooting, all 3-point attempts. … Kemba Walker battled foul trouble in the first half (he picked up his third with four minutes left in the second quarter), but he still led all players with 24 points, in addition to five assists. … Denver had 25 fast-break points, while Charlotte had 13.\n\nFinal thought\n\nIt was fun to watch JaVale McGee elevate.\n\nUp next\n\nL.A. Lakers, 7 p.m. Monday\n\nBenjamin Hochman, The Denver Post"
