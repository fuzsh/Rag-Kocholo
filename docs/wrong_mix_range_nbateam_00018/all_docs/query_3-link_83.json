        "text": "DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Pistons worked the phones last summer, trying to trade for a superstar to shake up their roster.\n\nThey ended up standing pat because a deal didn’t make sense.\n\nTwo games into the season, Allen Iverson was the answer to their hopes in a blockbuster that generated rare buzz for the NBA in November.\n\nDetroit acquired the former NBA MVP on Monday for All-Star point guard and former finals MVP Chauncey Billups, top reserve Antonio McDyess and project Cheikh Samb.\n\n“We just felt it was the right time to change our team,” Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press. “Iverson gives us a dimension that we haven’t had here and we really think it’s going to help us.”\n\nThe Pistons have reached six straight Eastern Conference finals — the longest such streak since the Los Angeles Lakers’ dominant run in the 1980s — and won the 2004 title without a player expected to be in the Hall of Fame.\n\n“Trading Marilyn Monroe for Jane Russell. That’s not bad,” said Larry Brown, who coached the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and Iverson in Philadelphia. “Joe knows what he’s doing, and I’m happy Chauncey’s going back to Denver and his family is there.”\n\nIverson may not be around for long — making $20.8 million in the final season of his contract — but The Answer might be what Detroit needs to return to the NBA finals for the first time since 2005.\n\nDetroit played Monday night at Charlotte, where the Bobcats are led by Larry Brown. The Hall of Fame coach helped Billups and the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and guided the Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers to a spot in the finals in 2001."
