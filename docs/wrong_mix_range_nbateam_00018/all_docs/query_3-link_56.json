        "text": "Recent rumblings have the Nuggets interested in Knicks point guard Raymond Felton being added to the Carmelo Anthony package, with the Knicks taking back aging Chauncey Billups.\n\nSo far, that element has not been a consideration for Knicks president Donnie Walsh, whose signing of Felton has been one of the best values of the 2010 summer free-agent market.\n\nThe Felton acquisition recently drew rave reviews from Lakers star Kobe Bryant, and the former Bobcats point guard was in consideration to be named to the All-Star Team as a reserve. He’s averaging 17.2 points and 9.0 assists, though his defense has been unspectacular recently.\n\nKNICKS SHOULD BE PATIENT\n\nBAD IDEA FOR LAKERS\n\nBillups, 34, always has been best in a halfcourt offense, and at his age, probably couldn’t handle Mike D’Antoni’s speedball system. Felton and Amar’e Stoudemire have made a nifty connection despite their recent slide.\n\nBillups’ contract is not guaranteed for next season, so one potential theory is the Knicks, in gaining Anthony, could waive Billups after the season and use the cap space for a legitimate free-agent starting center along the lines of Tyson Chandler or Marc Gasol.\n\nThen in 2012, the Knicks could sign PG Chris Paul, who also is represented by Anthony’s agency, CAA.\n\nHowever, the flip side is it leaves the Knicks without the kind of point guard D’Antoni needs for two seasons. Billups’ agent, Andy Miller, was quoted as saying Billups would want a buyout if he were traded to the Nets.\n\nMiller said yesterday he couldn’t comment because he hadn’t spoken to Billups about the subject. It’s likely, though, Billups would eat up the Big Apple, as he is known in Detroit, his former home, as “Mr. Big Shot.”\n\n*\n\nLakers coach Phil Jackson was over-the-top coy regarding the rumors the club may take Anthony for Andrew Bynum.\n\n“If they gave us Anthony straight up for Derrick Caracter, we’d do it,” Jackson said."
