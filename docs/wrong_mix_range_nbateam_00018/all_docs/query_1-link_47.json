        "text": "Charlotte\n\nElden Campbell Back to Charlotte?\n\nPhilip Maymin\n\nBasketball News Services\n\nWhenElden Campbell was still playing for the Lakers in his early years, including his rookie season alongside Magic Johnson, many observers were enthralled with his versatility, power, and size, and claimed he could play three positions. In the first few of his many years in the league, Campbell was a high-flying big man. You can think of him as the Marcus Camby of his time.\n\nToday, he is a solid off-the-bench performer for the big and tall Detroit Pistons. Detroit has so much depth with big men that the overall second round pick Darko Milicic can't get any playing time whatsoever. But this summer will have the Pistons making some tough choices. Re-sign Mehmet Okur or Rasheed Wallace? Who do they protect and who do they keep unprotected?\n\nThe Pistons only have eight players under contract through next year; five players are unrestricted free agents. But Detroit must expose at least one non-free agent to the expansion draft. Campbell is one of those eight, and one of the most likely to be left unprotected.\n\nSurely Detroit will keep its core of Rip Hamilton and Chauncey Billups in the backcourt, as well as Ben Wallace and Tayshaun Prince in the frontcourt. They would be egregiously stupid to leave Milicic unprotected. That leaves Corliss Williamson, Mike James, and Elden Campbell.\n\nThe others will be addressed in future Charlotte NEWS@ Reports, but for now let's consider Campbell. He will be in the last year of an $8.4mm contract. He is a 16 year veteran of the NBA, and has already played in Charlotte for four seasons, from 1999-2002. His recent production is down relative to his career average but only because of the brief amount of minutes he gets on the deep Pistons squad. Double his minutes to 25-30 a night, and he can go back to the near double-doubles of his prime.\n\nFurthermore, Campbell would be an excellent tutor to whatever young big man the Bobcats draft with their fourth overall pick. With so many high-schoolers and early college graduates, the Bobcats are likely to end up with someone who still needs some polishing before becoming an All-Star.\n\nCampbell might be just the man to do that.\n\nTEAM NOTES\n\nFrom nba.com/bobcats:\n\nThe days are winding down to the Charlotte Expansion Draft and the 2004 NBA Draft.
