        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Chauncey Billups scored 30 points, including a 15-footer with 0.3 seconds left in the second overtime, as Detroit beat Memphis, 106-104, last night.\n\nBillups took the inbounds pass from Tayshaun Prince, dribbled to the left side of the key and hit the shot to send the Pistons to their fourth straight win.\n\nPau Gasol, who led the Grizzlies with 32 points and 14 rebounds, scored in the final seconds of regulation and the first overtime to force the extra periods. The Grizzlies lost for the fourth time in five games.\n\nRaptors 92, Magic 90\n\nORLANDO, Fla. -- Morris Peterson scored 19 points, including a clinching 3-pointer with 8 seconds left, as Toronto beat Orlando to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nThe Raptors made nine 3-pointers, including one by Mike James that gave them the lead for good. Chris Bosh also scored 19 points for Toronto, which has earned four of its five wins this season on the road.\n\nBobcats 106, Kings 103, OT\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Primoz Brezec scored five of his 26 points in overtime to help Charlotte beat Sacramento.\n\nThe win was costly for the Bobcats, who lost forward Emeka Okafor and guard Kareem Rush to injuries during the game. Okafor left with what appeared to be a seriously sprained right ankle late in the third quarter.\n\nThey were crippling injuries to a team already playing without starting point guard Brevin Knight (arm injury) and forward Melvin Ely (flu). Okafor, Ely and Rush are all expected to miss Tuesday night's game in Chicago.\n\nGerald Wallace finished with 15 points for Charlotte. Raymond Felton, making his second start of the season in place of Knight, returned from an early ankle sprain to contribute 14 points, nine assists and a 19-foot jumper to open the overtime period.\n\nShareer Abdur-Rahim finished with 32 points to lead the Kings, who lost their third consecutive game.\n\nThis story appeared on Page C2 of The Standard-Times on December 20, 2005."
