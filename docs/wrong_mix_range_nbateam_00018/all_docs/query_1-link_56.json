        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — If the Trail Blazers are going to amount to anything this season, coach Chauncey Billups says they need the best version of Jusuf Nurkić. And on Monday, the coach didn’t like what he was seeing from his massive center while the lowly Charlotte Hornets were running circles around the Blazers.\n\n“In every timeout in the first half, he was really on it … like, ‘Nurk! Come on!'” Nurkić said.\n\nBecause Nurkić is so skilled, so versatile and so big, he can impact the game in so many ways, making him one of the most important cogs to the Blazers’ machine. But on Monday, Billups didn’t like Nurkić’s focus. And he especially didn’t like his careless passing, which led to two turnovers.\n\n“He was like, ‘Come on, if it’s not there, you can’t throw that pass if he is not open!'” Nurkić said. “And … I understand. I want to be the guy I know I can be.”\n\nBillups’ pointed commentary continued into the halftime locker room, although Nurkić said the focus became aimed more at the team rather than just him. The Blazers, who entered the night having lost three in a row, trailed lowly Charlotte 67-61, which was a small victory considering Portland trailed by as many as 14.\n\nThere’s no sure way to know if Billups’ sharp words did the trick, but there was no mistaking the difference in the Blazers — and particularly Nurkić — after halftime. Nurkić triggered the Blazers’ turnaround with a second half that included 21 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and two blocks, capping perhaps his best night of the season in the Blazers’ 124-113 win. All told, Nurkić had 28 points, 15 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks in 36 minutes.\n\n“It was impressive; very impressive,” Billups said. “He had a night.”\n\nOn the surface, Monday’s performance by Nurkić is notable because he made a career-high five 3-pointers (hitting his first five attempts). After taking 56 3-pointers last season (hitting 15), Nurkić this season has attempted 56 and made 26 (46.4 percent). His increased threat beyond the 3-point line emphasizes perhaps the biggest difference in the Blazers’ offense during the Damian Lillard era — a center who makes enough 3-pointers to force opponents to extend their defense, thereby opening driving lanes for Lillard and fellow guard Anfernee Simons.\n\n“It’s a big deal,’’ Billups said. “It adds a different dimension to our offense.’’\n\nBut it is what has led to those 3-point statistics, and what is behind Monday’s spirited commentary, that is key to this season and beyond. There is a chemistry, a connection, between Billups and Nurkić that is slowly but surely getting Nurkić closer to that best version of himself.\n\nAs those sitting courtside can attest, Billups is hard on Nurkić. Heck, on Monday, from press row halfway up the 100 level, you could hear Billups barking at Nurkić as the Blazers scrambled to get into a set.\n\n“Yeah … everybody knew the play, and I didn’t know the play,” Nurkić said, trying to hold back a sheepish grin. “He yelled at me a couple times in tonight’s game, but that’s the great part about it: he faces you and lets you know. I know it’s not personal, whatever he says or does. I know he’s saying it for me, for the team. I understand where he is coming from.”\n\nNurkić accepts Billups’ sharp words and demand for details because the former player has empowered him with the greatest gifts a coach can give: belief and trust.\n\nThat’s why Nurkić says there is no great story behind his emergence as a 3-point shooter. He attempted 84 over his first seven seasons in the NBA. In one-plus season under the guidance of Billups and big-man assistant Roy Rogers, Nurkić has attempted 112.\n\n“I don’t think it’s really an evolution; I think it’s a will and the freedom to let me do it,” Nurkić said. “Roy Rogers and Chauncey Billups are your answer. Chauncey let me do it and called the plays to put me in position, and Roy was the one who gave me the focus to be a good shooter. Even when people started closing out and trying to take it away, Roy was still on me, telling me I have to still do it. (Rogers) kept saying ‘You have to do it the right way.'”\n\nBillups said he hasn’t afforded Nurkić the green light to shoot 3s as liberally as Lillard, but he doesn’t discourage him and can only remember twice this season when he was upset with Nurkić’s 3-point shot selection.\n\n“He’s done a good job of not taking advantage of that freedom,” Billups said.\n\nBillups said the progression of Nurkić shooting more 3s has evolved as Nurkić better understands what is a good attempt.\n\n“I’m always telling him: ‘Just read the game,'” Billups said. “My thing with him and some of the other guys … I say, just think about it: When you shoot a 3, there’s one coach mad and one coach happy. So if you shoot a bad 3, who is going to be happy? So … be thinking about that.”\n\nNurkić this season is averaging 14.8 points and 9.9 rebounds and 3.0 assists — not his best season — but it might be his most impactful season. His offensive role has diminished with the addition of Jerami Grant and the growth of Simons, but Billups says Nurkić has continued to be the defensive anchor of the team and has been a great teammate. And now, with the emergence of Nurkić’s 3-point threat, Billups says the Blazers’ playbook is deeper and more varied.\n\n“There’s not a lot of centers in the league who are as talented and as skilled as him,” Billups said. “You have a big guy who can man your paint defensively, rebounds, can be good with the pass … and can make the 3. You can’t name me that many guys who can do that. So (making 3s) does make us a little more dangerously offensively.”\n\nThe Nurkić-Billups dynamic has been one of the success stories of Billups’ young career. From the start, when Nurkić flew from Bosnia to Portland in his excitement that Billups was hired, to today, as Billups lets his center have it during timeouts, the two have agreed that they will give it all in the name of winning games. And true to his word, Nurkić has not pouted when Billups opts to finish games with a smaller lineup. And Nurkić has not become sensitive to criticism. Instead, Billups says Nurkić has remained about the team, and about improving his miscues.\n\n“Nurk is just such a good teammate,” Billups said. “And he really cares, and he actually just really wants to win.”\n\nThere is still a long way to go. Nurkić wants to be more consistent. And Billups wants the defense that Nurkić anchors to be more staunch. Both Billups and Nurkić lamented Monday that the Blazers defense that was so good the first three weeks of the season has drastically slipped as the offense has improved. For some reason, as the shots began to fall, the defense loosened. Billups said the defense will be the No. 1 topic in Tuesday’s practice.\n\nIt’s a practice that might include some barking at Nurkić, and the big man won’t mind. He wants to get better, and he believes the man behind the bark is the coach to do it. That’s become evident during every interview this season, when Nurkić invariably brings the conversation to Billups, and how the coach has changed him for the better.\n\n“To me, it’s still crazy that he is a coach. It really is,” Nurkić said. “It’s almost as if Dame is the coach, because it’s something that feels like he still a player. It’s amazing. I still have to believe it, like … he’s my coach! He’s been great. I love it.”"
