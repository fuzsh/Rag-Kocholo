        "text": "One source said it’s his impression the Bobcats are canvassing much of the league, to judge what they could do to salvage this season. Jordan told season ticket-holders in the preseason he expected the Bobcats to reach the playoffs and advance in them. Jordan also said he’d prefer not to continue churning the roster with trades. But that was before the Bobcats started playing so poorly. Jordan personally addressed the team after Saturday’s blow-out loss to Boston. Team personnel described Jordan’s remarks as stern and loud. “I’d think they’re proposing different scenarios to different teams; maybe 15 or 20,’’ said one of the sources, adding that Chicago and Detroit might be two teams receptive to making a deal.\n\nFirst things first, coach, you’ve looked better and better out there on the court lately. How are you feeling? George Karl: I feel really good. I had the flu for a few days and a temperature of 101 degrees, but now I’m doing fine. I just want to get as many wins as we can on this road trip, but we have some tough places to play. Charlotte is always hard for us. Carmelo Anthony and Gerald Wallace have a thing for each other and Wallace makes it tough on Melo. And then we play Boston and it seems like we’re always in Boston on a back-to-back, so that won’t be easy. But I’m happy this time of year. Really happy. I like December and Christmas is going to be enjoyable.\n\nPlayers fitting that description who appeal to Denver, according to sources, include Andre Iguodala and Gerald Wallace. The Sixers have no interest in helping their neighbors to the north land Melo, and Philly flat-out isn’t on Melo’s list of teams he’d agree to an extension with, a person with knowledge of his strategy told CBSSports.com Thursday. Wallace has come to be regarded as untouchable in Charlotte, especially if trading him would help another Eastern Conference team get Anthony."
