Not as much as another championship, but it means a lot to even be mentioned.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;In a matchup of MVP candidates, Billups was sensational while Nash struggled, shooting 4-of-11 for 13 points.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&#34;Chauncey was amazing,&#34; Nash said.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;The Pistons (59-14) clinched the best record ahead of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&#34;This is the third of our five steps, but this one might be the most important of the first four, because of the 2-2-1-1-1 format in the conference finals,&#34; Detroit coach Flip Saunders said.&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;The first two goals were to make the playoffs and win the division, and the last two are to clinch the best record in the league and win a second title in three years.

But we haven&#39;t seen that. This is just like last year when he carried us on his back in the second half of the season.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Shaquille O&#39;Neal &#8212; playing in his first game since missing two games with a hyperextended left knee &#8212; scored 18 points, nine in the fourth quarter.
