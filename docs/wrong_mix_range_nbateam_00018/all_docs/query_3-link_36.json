        "text": "Nearly a decade after resurrecting the franchise and leading it to an NBA championship, Chauncey Billups has reached agreement on a two-year contract to return to the Detroit Pistons, league sources told Yahoo! Sports.\n\nThe deal will be worth $5 million-plus for Billups, league sources said.\n\nBillups, 36, hopes to finish his career where it blossomed in the glory years of the Billups-Richard Hamilton-Ben Wallace Pistons of the mid-2000s. Billups will play the part of mentor for young Detroit guard Brandon Knight, and be a rotation guard off the bench for Detroit.\n\nPistons general manager Joe Dumars has long regretted trading Billups to the Denver Nuggets for the expiring contract of Allen Iverson in the 2008-09 season. Now, Dumars has brought back Billups with a mandate to nurture and perform for the Pistons.\n\nFor Billups, the trade sent him to his hometown Nuggets, where he played an immense part in the maturity of Carmelo Anthony and the franchise's growth into a Western Conference finalist. For the Pistons, the loss of Billups started a spiral that eventually led to four straight non-playoff seasons. Now, Billups returns with a mandate to help Detroit's talented young core reach the postseason again under new coach Mo Cheeks.\n\nBillups suffered a torn Achilles tendon in February of 2012 with the Los Angeles Clippers, but worked his way back to play this past season with the team. Billups is a five-time All-Star and the NBA Finals MVP for his performance in the Pistons' 2004 championship series victory over the Los Angeles Lakers."
