        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, MICH. - Chauncey Billups scored eight of his 31 points in the final three minutes to help Detroit Pistons beat the Dallas Mavericks 97-90 Tuesday night.\n\nThe win avenged Detroit’s worst loss of the season, a 119-82 rout in Dallas on Nov. 19. It also assured the Pistons (56-14) a split of the season series with Dallas (54-17), which could be crucial for determining home-court advantage if the teams meet in the NBA Finals.\n\nRasheed Wallace added 21 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, while Richard Hamilton scored 14 points.\n\nDirk Nowitzki and former Piston Jerry Stackhouse each had 25 for Dallas.\n\nStackhouse, who still holds the Pistons’ single-game scoring record, had nine points in the third quarter, but the Mavericks needed Keith Van Horn’s late 3-pointer to stay within 72-69 at quarter’s end.\n\nThe teams traded the advantage for most of the fourth, and the game was tied with 3 minutes to play.\n\nThat’s when Billups hit a free throw after a defensive three-second violation, then added a 3-pointer to give the Pistons a 92-88 lead.\n\nNowitzki hit a jumper at the other end, but Tayshaun Prince blocked his attempt at a tying shot moments later and Billups iced the game with a 3-pointer.\n\nBOBCATS 125, HAWKS 117: Gerald Wallace scored 18 of his career-high 41 points in the fourth quarter, and host Charlotte pulled away to beat Atlanta. Raymond Felton added 28 points and 10 assists, and hit the clinching 3-pointer with 31 seconds left. Charlotte shot 57 percent, snapped a three-game losing streak and scored the most points in its two-year history. Wallace hit 17 of 22 shots, including two alley-oop dunks in the final quarter to set a franchise record for points in a game. He scored six more than Kareem Rush had against Indiana on Nov. 16. Joe Johnson scored 35 points and Josh Smith added 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Hawks, who have lost five straight. BUCKS 132, SUNS 110: Charlie Bell had career highs of 19 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double, and host Milwaukee Bucks hit a franchise-record 18 3-pointers. Michael Redd had 28 points as the Bucks set season highs in almost every offensive category, scoring 46 points in a blistering third-quarter 3-point assault. NOTEBOOK ARENAS SIDELINED: Gilbert Arenas, the NBA’s fourth-leading scorer, missed the Washington Wizards’ game at Sacramento with an apparent case of the flu. Arenas felt ill at the Wizards’ morning shootaround after scoring 40 points in a 116-98 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Monday night, coach Eddie Jordan said. The two-time All-Star guard was replaced in Washington’s starting lineup by Antonio Daniels. PARKER MISSES GAME: Tony Parker, the San Antonio Spurs’ leading scorer, missed his first game of the season because of a bruised right shin. Parker was injured during a 106-102 loss at Seattle on Sunday night when he was accidentally kicked, and was inactive for the game against the Los Angeles Clippers."
