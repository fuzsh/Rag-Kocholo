        "text": "Rodney Billups enters his sixth year with the University of Colorado men's basketball team and his fourth year as an assistant coach on Tad Boyle’s staff.\n\nDuring his first two years (2010-12) in Boulder, Billups was the director basketball operations where he was an integral part of the behind-of-the-scenes success of back-to-back school-bests 24-win campaigns with travel, scheduling, and the day-to-day operations of the program.\n\nWhen he was promoted to the coaching staff as an assistant coach prior to the 2012-13 season, the Buffaloes didn’t skip a beat. Billups continued CU’s excellence enjoying their finest seasons with a 21-win campaign in 2012-13, and another 23 victories in 2013-14, the third-most victories in school history.\n\nDuring Billups’s tenure with the coaching staff, the Buffaloes’ have accumulated 108 victories, the most wins in any five-year span of the 114 years of the program. In addition, five-straight seasons of post-season play (2010-2015) and three-straight NCAA Tournament berths (2011-14), are also school-firsts.\n\nOver the last five seasons, Billups has coached a number of CU student-athletes to conference excellence.\n\nIn CU’s first year of the Pac-12, Andre Roberson (first team, All-Defensive, All-Tournament team), Carlon Brown (second team, tournament’s Most Outstanding Player), and Spencer Dinwiddie (freshman team), all garnered all-conference honors.\n\nIn year two of the conference, Roberson (first team, Defensive Player of the Year, All-Defensive team); Dinwiddie (first team) and Josh Scott (All-Freshman team) earned post-season accolades. In the third year, Scott continued CU’s prominence among the elite Pac-12 Conference players, as he was selected to the first team, while Askia Booker was an honorable mention selection, as to, Wesley Gordon to the honorable mention freshman team. Booker was also named to the Pac-12 All-Tournament team.\n\nDuring his previous five years on the staff, Billups has also helped mentored four former CU student-athlete standouts to the next step professionally in their respective basketball careers.\n\nAlec Burks, a sophomore was CU’s second-ever lottery pick, was selected No. 12 overall by the Utah Jazz in the 2011 NBA Draft, while Andre Roberson left after his junior year, was the No. 26 overall selection by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2013 (later traded to Oklahoma City).\n\nSpencer Dinwiddie, also a junior, was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the 2014 NBA Draft (second round, No. 38 overall); and Cory Higgins, the school’s all-time co-leader in points, played with the Charlotte Bobcats during the 2011-12 season.\n\nBillups is the younger brother of former CU great Chauncey Billups, who played with the Buffaloes from 1995-97.\n\nThe younger Billups is also a Colorado native, graduating from George Washington High School in 2001. He would go on to be a three-year standout with the University of Denver from 2002-05.\n\n“Rodney continues to bring a lot of value to our staff,” men’s basketball head coach Tad Boyle said. “Each year, he gets more and more comfortable in his recruiting role, and continues to develop into a fine, young coach.\"\n\nAt DU, Billups averaged 10.2 points, 6.4 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game during his 2004-05 senior campaign. In addition to leading the Sun Belt Conference in assists, he also ranked 17th nationally in that category. Billups was named an All-SBC third team selection in 2004-05, the same season he helped the Pioneers win 20 games and a National Invitational Tournament berth.\n\nBillups' 199 assists in his senior season, ranked third all-time in school history, while his 58 steals, was seventh. During his three years at DU, Billups was fourth in assists (418) and steals (154).\n\nFor his career, he averaged 8.5 points, in addition to 4.6 assists, 2.7 rebounds and 1.7 steals per game.\n\nIn 2004-05, Billups was named co-recipient of the Floyd M. Theard Jr. Memorial Award. An award presented each year to the DU men's basketball player who best displays the qualities of leadership, scholarship and sportsmanship.\n\nBillups earned his business management degree from DU in 2005.
