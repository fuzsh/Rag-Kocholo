        "text": "? The Detroit Pistons are having a hard time erasing the memory of one of the worst brawls in U.S. sports history.\n\nTwo days after several members of the visiting Indiana Pacers went into the stands at The Palace to fight spectators, the Pistons were left with the aftereffects. They put it all behind them long enough to earn a 117-116 double-overtime victory over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\n“With the playoff mob of media that we have here, you would think it’s the Finals,” Detroit’s Lindsey Hunter said. “I’m already away from (Friday night). I’m not really thinking about it as much. I think everybody else is more than we are.”\n\nTayshaun Prince’s dunk with 16.5 seconds left lifted the short-handed Pistons in their first game since the melee that started on the court and got out of control in the seats.\n\nDespite the close contest and fantastic game-winning play, few questions were asked about Sunday’s action as reporters from around the country came to suburban Detroit to cover the aftermath of the mayhem.\n\nSecurity was beefed up, and there was a larger police presence at the arena, as well.\n\n“I’m not really excited about doing my job right now,” Pistons coach Larry Brown said. “I heard one of our trainers say that it isn’t much fun going to work, and I can honestly say the same thing.”\n\nThe Pistons finished with just five players because three fouled out, and four were suspended for their roles in the melee with the Pacers.\n\n“It got to a point where I thought we were going to play four on five,” said Antonio McDyess, who scored 24. “We really tried to just focus on playing basketball because this is our job, and all the other stuff is out of our control at this point.”\n\nThe Pistons had a short bench, but unlike Indiana, they soon will have all their players back.\n\nDetroit’s Ben Wallace — whose shove of Indiana’s Ron Artest after a foul led to the fracas — drew a six-game ban. Teammates Chauncey Billups, Elden Campbell and Derrick Coleman were suspended for one game.\n\nAbout 30 minutes before Sunday’s game, Billups, Campbell and Coleman left the arena.\n\n“I’m going home,” said Billups, declining further comment.\n\nWallace never came to the arena because he knew he would be suspended for at least one game.\n\nDetroit’s Richard Hamilton set a team record for most free throws made in a game without missing by going 20-for-20 and tied a Pistons mark for successful free throws. He scored 30 points before fouling out late in regulation. McDyess scored 24, and Rasheed Wallace had 13 before both fouled out.\n\nCharlotte’s Jason Kapono scored a career-high 25 points before fouling out in the second overtime. Primoz Brezec scored a career-high 22 for the Bobcats, and Steve Smith added 22.\n\nThe Bobcats had chances to be the first expansion team to beat a reigning NBA champion since Portland and Buffalo defeated the New York Knicks during the 1969-70 season. Charlotte still is searching for its first road victory.\n\n“It’s not frustrating because we played well, and we had a chance to win,” Smith said. “It’s just disappointing that we couldn’t get the win.”\n\nSuns 122, Clippers 111\n\nLos Angeles — Amare Stoudemire overcame early foul trouble to score 33 points, and Phoenix beat the Clippers for its fourth straight victory. Joe Johnson had 23 points and Shawn Marion 22 for the Suns, who improved to 8-2 and matched their best start since going 9-1 in 1980-81. Steve Nash had 22 points and 18 assists. Quentin Richardson, playing his first regular-season game in Los Angeles since leaving the Clippers, had 11 points in 30 minutes before fouling out.\n\nRaptors 96, Spurs 91\n\nToronto — Lamond Murray scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter, helping Toronto overcome a 20-point deficit. Rafer Alston had 20 points, a season-high 11 assists and seven rebounds for the Raptors, who ended a five-game losing streak.\n\nHeat 93, 76ers 83\n\nMiami — Dwyane Wade scored 25 points, and Miami remained unbeaten against Eastern Conference opponents by beating short-handed Philadelphia. Shaquille O’Neal had 19 points, 12 rebounds and six blocks for the Heat, who are 7-0 against the East and 1-3 against the Western Conference.\n\nRockets 97, Trail Blazers 93\n\nPortland, Ore. — Tracy McGrady had 16 points and 11 assists, and Yao Ming led Houston with 19 points to help the Rockets hold off Portland. Portland’s Zach Randolph had 28 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nCeltics 102, SuperSonics 83\n\nBoston — Ricky Davis scored 25 points, and Paul Pierce added 17 points and 10 rebounds to help Boston snap Seattle’s nine-game winning streak. Ray Allen scored 21 for Seattle, but Rashard Lewis was just 4-for-13 from the field and scored 12 points as the Sonics shot 36 percent as a team.\n\nKnicks 98, Cavaliers 88\n\nNew York — Jamal Crawford scored 13 of his 24 points during a fourth quarter in which New York held LeBron James scoreless and barely kept him from his first career triple-double. Drew Gooden led Cleveland with 25 points and 15 rebounds, Zydrunas Ilgauskas scored 21, and James had 13 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds.\n\nKings 88, Bucks 79\n\nSacramento, Calif. — Peja Stojakovic scored 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and Sacramento made a late rally for its fifth straight victory. Stojakovic hit three three-pointers during the Kings’ decisive 18-2 rally, and Chris Webber had 18 points and 14 rebounds despite 7-for-22 shooting. Brad Miller scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth to keep Sacramento unbeaten at home.\n\nNuggets 110, Mavericks 82\n\nDenver — Defensive specialist Greg Buckner scored a career-high 28 points, and Carmelo Anthony had 21, lifting Denver over Dallas. Dallas got Erick Dampier and Jason Terry back from injuries, but lost leading scorer and rebounder Dirk Nowitzki to a sprained left ankle.\n\nLakers 102, Bulls 93\n\nLos Angeles — Kobe Bryant had 29 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, his fellow starters all scored in double figures, and Los Angeles dropped Chicago to 0-8. Kirk Hinrich led Chicago with 24 points and a season-high 12 assists."
