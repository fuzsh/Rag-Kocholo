        "text": "Pick any Trail Blazers game this season, and there’s a good chance the same scene has played out in the back hallways of arenas across the NBA: A player from the opposing team spots Portland coach Chauncey Billups and goes out of his way to exchange hugs and pleasantries.\n\nIt happened from San Francisco to Charlotte and everywhere in between, and this summer the Trail Blazers are hoping it can get their franchise’s foot in the door of some key free agent meetings.\n\n“I think in recruiting, Chauncey will be a massive advantage,” Joe Cronin, the Blazers interim general manager, said. “He’s just so inspiring, even in a 30-minute meeting. It’s just easy to buy in with him.”\n\nFree agency and Portland have never been a good mix. Over the years, it hasn’t mattered how much money the Trail Blazers have to spend, and it hasn’t mattered which players they have recruiting peers. The bottom line is top-tier free agents historically haven’t chosen to sign in Portland.\n\nIn the past 30 years, the Blazers’ top free-agent signings have been Andre Miller (2009), Brian Grant (1997), Kenny Anderson (1996) and Rod Strickland (1992).\n\nToday, it’s a relevant topic because the Blazers will be flush with cap space — likely about $30 million — which will be one of the tools at their disposal in their quest to return to relevance. But unlike past eras, the Blazers won’t just be selling money and the chance to play with a star like Brandon Roy or Damian Lillard. They will have a charismatic and accomplished coach in Billups.\n\n“It’s going to be a big factor,” Cronin said. “He is extremely well-respected, across generations. The old players who might have played against him later in his career love him, and then you have the younger players who don’t remember him, probably, over his entire career, but they know about Chauncey Billups and will spend time getting to know him before getting here.”\n\nOver the past seven years, Lillard — with some help from CJ McCollum — has largely headed the Blazers’ recruiting efforts, which included unsuccessful forays at Carmelo Anthony in 2017 and Kelly Oubre Jr. last summer.\n\nBut now Lillard will have a wingman, if not a point man, as the Blazers head into the free-agent market. It’s a role Billups says he is ready to embrace.\n\n“If you have a coach who you know can do that and be good at it, you have to use that,” Billups said. “I fully intend to be involved in our recruitment of whoever it might be. That’s probably more unique than most situations.”\n\nBillups has cast a wide net around the league that extends beyond his accomplished 17-year NBA career. He worked for ESPN calling games, trained with several players after he retired and did front office training in Milwaukee before spending a year as an assistant for the Clippers.\n\n“I’ve been able to connect with any and everybody in our game,” Billups said. “That’s something we have to take advantage of.”\n\nThat’s not lip service or an inflated ego talking. It’s a real dynamic at work. There were times this season after he handled his pregame media responsibilities when Billups had difficulty returning to the locker room for pregame prep work because he was stopped so often by players from the opposing team.\n\nCronin said he expects the Blazers to have a quick bounce back from this season’s 27-win effort, which included losing 21 of the final 23 games. The Blazers sidelined many of their key players after the All-Star break to ensure they secured the best odds in the May 17 lottery. Portland has a 37.2 percent chance of moving into the top four and a nine percent chance of winning the No. 1 pick. On top of their lottery pick, Portland might secure New Orleans’ first-round pick and will have a $21 million trade exception to go with its cap space.\n\n“We had to take a step backward in order to move forward,” Cronin said. “And we’ve positioned ourselves to where we have some great opportunities.”\n\nCronin called the 2022 draft class “solid,” but most experts say the talent level drops considerably after the top four prospects: Auburn forward Jabari Smith, Gonzaga center Chet Holmgren, Duke forward Paolo Banchero and Purdue guard Jaden Ivey. On Monday, Cronin was revealing when he said his urgency to return to relevance will likely play a role in whether he uses the Blazers’ pick or trades it.\n\n“We want to be really competitive next year, and you are more likely to win with veteran players than young players, so that definitely will be a part of our decision-making process,” Cronin said.\n\nThe free-agent class is much like the draft class: a few big names, but not a bumper crop of franchise-changing talent. Still, there are some quality players such as forwards Kyle Anderson, Montrezl Harrell and Otto Porter Jr. who could bolster the Blazers’ bench.\n\n“I think we are in a place where we don’t necessarily have to hit a home run right out of the gate in order to be competitive,” Cronin said, pointing to a four-game win streak in February behind the talent of Anfernee Simons, Josh Hart, Jusuf Nurkic and Justise Winslow. “Our talent-level shined … so I don’t think we necessarily have to hit a home run, although we are going to try to hit a home run.”\n\nAnd Cronin thinks Billups might be just the person to get the ball over the fence. The last two Blazers coaches — Terry Stotts and Nate McMillan — were competent but didn’t have the rapport and name recognition of Billups. And now, with Billups having a year of head coaching under his belt, he has a body of work for other players to speak on.\n\nHart said if a player calls him this summer asking about Billups, he would give a strong endorsement.\n\n“I would say he’s great,” Hart said. “He’s a players’ coach, someone who does a great job of building you up, coaching you up, but a good balance in holding you accountable. And off the court, he cares about you as a person. That’s a big thing, something that gets overlooked sometimes.”\n\nWhether the Billups factor will be enough to help sway a key free agent toward Portland remains to be seen. Free agency doesn’t begin until July 1. But as the Blazers huddle and develop their offseason game plan, Billups and his gregarious personality will be at the center of it.\n\n“I know and I believe that a lot of players in this league want to play for somebody like me,” Billups said. “I just believe that. Former player, understands the cadence of the NBA, understands what is important in terms of playing and rest. A dude who is going to hold you accountable without being disrespectful toward you … and I’m a guy who believes that even the great players want to be coached. Whether they say it or not, everybody wants to be coached, because most people want to be great.”\n\nAnd that will be the pitch: Come to Portland and play with an All-Star point guard, and for a former All-Star point guard who won a title. And together, they can all make Portland great again."
