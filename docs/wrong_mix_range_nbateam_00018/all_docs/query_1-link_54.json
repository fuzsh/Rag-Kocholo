        "text": "Billups said he was “disappointed” that Madison Square Garden was not open Wednesday. But he made it clear he’s prepared to miss all 82 games if both sides can’t agree to a deal that is amenable to the players. “I’m willing to fight with the union,” Billups, 35, said. “Do I want to lose $14 million or whatever it might be? I don’t want to lose a dime. My career is almost over. I want all of that. But at the same time, I was in that other lockout (in 1998-99) and I know what those older guys were willing to do for me. … I’m in that position now and that’s where I stand.” Billups, a 14-year veteran in the final year of a $60.5 million contract, said he has spoken to “a lot of players” who are also willing to sit out the season if it means signing a CBA they feel is fair. If the season is canceled, Billups will miss out on the $14.3 million option the Knicks picked up in April. “I could see a lot of players willing to do it,” Billups said.\n\nChauncey Billups is willing to sacrifice his $14 million salary for a fair collective bargaining agreement. Billups said on Wednesday night that he is prepared to forgo his $14.3 million contract and sit out the entire year if owners and players cannot agree on a deal that is economically fair to the rest of the players. “For the betterment of the league going forward that’s just something that I’m going to have to sacrifice and that’s the position I’m going to have to take,” Billups said on ESPN New York 1050’s “The Stephen A. Smith Show.”"
