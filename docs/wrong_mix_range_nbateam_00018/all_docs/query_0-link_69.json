        "text": "Primoz Brezec roots for his former team, especially when it benefits his current one. When the Charlotte Bobcats surprised the Celtics in Boston Wednesday night, Brezec gave his ex-teammates a long-distance pat on the back. “I texted a couple of them and sent them a thank you note for for doing us a favor,” said Brezec, who was traded along with Walter Herrmann to the Pistons last month for Nazr Mohammed. “I was happy for them. It was a good win for them.” Brezec and Herrmann will return to Charlotte tonight, though it’s uncertain whether either one will play. They have seen spot minutes since the trade, with Brezec appearing in 10 games and Herrmann getting action in four. Neither one took off his warmup jersey during the Pistons’ 90-80 win at San Antonio Thursday night. They realize that the Pistons made the move to help their long-term salary-cap situation. Mohammed had three more years left on his contract while Brezec and Herrmann become unrestricted free agents after the season. Brezec was a starter in Charlotte, though his playing time and offensive opportunities diminished before he was traded. “I have no regrets,” he said. “I wish them well. I’m still friends with those guys. … Obviously, I want to play, but I’m patient. I’m going to wait for my chance and when it comes, I’m going to take advantage of it.” The Pistons need to take advantage of an opportunity to play two sub-.500 teams to have a successful road trip. They have played three consecutive elite teams, losing to Boston at The Palace and the Mavericks in Dallas before their wounded pride led to an inspired outing against the defending champions. The Pistons finish off the four-game, five-night road trip against the troubled New York Knicks Sunday. Charlotte’s road win against the team with the best record should help the Pistons avoid a letdown. “One thing about Charlotte, everybody knows they play hard every night,” Brezec said. “It’s a high-energy team and they’re going to try to beat us. But if we play like we did (Thursday), I don’t think anybody can beat us.” While Brezec and Herrmann are still searching for a role, the Bobcats have made Mohammed an important part of their team. Mohammed started five games for Charlotte after the trade and is now playing steady minutes off the bench. He had 18 points and 10 rebounds against the Celtics and is averaging 10.9 points and 8.2 rebounds. “I’ve talked to Nazr a few times and he’s happy,” Chauncey Billups said. “He’s playing a consistent role and playing well. Of course, he misses being around here, but he’s happy and I’m happy for him.” Cheers all around for ‘Coach’ If anyone forgot about Lindsey Hunter, they got an emphatic reminder Thursday that he can still make game-changing plays. With the Pistons trying to accelerate Rodney Stuckey’s progress, Hunter was placed on the inactive list for seven straight games. He was in uniform Thursday because Stuckey’s left hand, which he fractured in the preseason, swelled up after a fall in the Mavs’ game. Hunter was inserted at the start of the fourth quarter after the Spurs had cut Detroit’s one-time 20-point lead to nine. In six minutes, Hunter scored seven points, made two steals, took a charge and hounded Spurs guards Jacque Vaughn and Manu Ginobili. “We brought ‘Coach’ Hunter out, took him off the blocks and he came in there and did his thing,” Rasheed Wallace said. “He came in at an important time and did what he does, locking guys up,” Billups added. “He hit a couple of big shots and we depend on him to do that. We put a lot of pressure on him around here. As soon as we lose a game, we’re looking around like ‘Where the heck is Lindsey at?’ It’s good to see him come out and play well again.” Stuckey, who played seven ineffective minutes in the first half, had an X-ray on his hand and it was negative. Saunders close to passing Scott Flip Saunders needs just four more wins to take sole possession of second place on the Pistons’ all-time coaching wins list. He has 144 victories since become Detroit’s head coach in 2005. Ray Scott (1972-76) had 147 coaching wins with the franchise. Chuck Daly’s record of 467 Pistons coaching victories from 1983-92 may never be broken. Contact Dana Gauruder at dana.gauruder@oakpress.com."
