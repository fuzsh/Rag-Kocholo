They lost forward Kenyon Martin to an ejection late in the second quarter when he argued with officials over a foul call against teammate J.R. Smith.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Denver's Chris Anderson got his feet tangled underneath the basket going for a rebound and crashed to the floor.\n\nCopyright 2010 The Associated Press.
