        "text": "DENVER — Wilson Chandler had 16 points to lead seven Denver players scoring in double figures and the Nuggets beat the Charlotte Bobcats 120-80 on Wednesday night for their biggest win of the season.\n\nNene, Chris Andersen, Ty Lawson and J.R. Smith had 14 points apiece for the Nuggets, who won for the fourth time in five games since completing the blockbuster trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to the New York Knicks.\n\nThe 40-point margin of victory surpassed Denver’s previous high this season, a 34-point win against on Phoenix on Jan. 11.\n\nMatt Carroll led Charlotte with 19 points. D.J. Augustin added 13 points and Shaun Livingston had 12.\n\nArron Afflalo, the only Nuggets player to play in all 62 games, rolled his ankle driving to the basket in the first quarter but returned. With a little more than five minutes to go in the third quarter, Afflalo was fouled hard when Gerald Henderson barreled into him on another drive to the basket.\n\nNuggets coach George Karl had seen enough by then, and with the game well in hand, had Afflalo take the rest of the night off.\n\nTrailing by 16 at the half, the Bobcats scored eight of the first 10 points in the third quarter, starting with a 20-foot jumper by Stephen Jackson, to cut the deficit to 64-54.\n\nBut the Nuggets answered with an 8-2 run, including successive dunks by Nene and Chandler to build their lead back to 72-56 with 6:56 left in the third quarter.\n\nWhen Andersen closed out Denver’s third quarter scoring on a dunk off a pass from Smith, the Nuggets had built their lead to 91-67 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nCharlotte was outscored 29-13 in the final period.\n\nThe Nuggets set the tone for the game early, leading by 18 points in the second quarter and going in front 62-46 at halftime. Chandler and Andersen each had 10 points in the first half.\n\nIn New York, where Chauncey Billups didn't play after bruising his left quadriceps Tuesday against Orlando, Carmelo Anthony was held below 25 points for the first time in his five games with the Knicks. But that’s only because he sat out the fourth quarter after scoring 22 in New York’s 107-88 victory over New Orleans, its sixth straight win against the Hornets, matching its longest current winning streak against any opponent.\n\nNOTES: Bobcats GM Rod Higgins said they plan to re-sign F Dominic McGuire and will sign G Garrett Temple of the NBA Development League to a 10-day contract. C Sean Marks will be waived to make room on the 15-man roster. McGuire was let go last week after the Bobcats’ two trades left them with 18 players . . . C Timofey Mozgov played the final 1:53 of the second quarter in his first action with the Nuggets since being included in the three-team, 13-player trade that sent Anthony to New York. Kosta Koufos, who also came to Denver in the trade, made his first appearance with the Nuggets late in the fourth . . . Chandler has scored at least 10 points in each of his four games with Denver.\n\n. . . Charlotte’s Stephen Jackson was held to seven points after scoring at least 30 in his previous two games."
