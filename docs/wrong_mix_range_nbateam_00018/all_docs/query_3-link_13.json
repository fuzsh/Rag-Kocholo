        "text": "The team huddled around its quarterback, a long drive on the horizon. After Tuesday’s Nuggets practice, Chauncey Billups spoke softly about the quest that begins tonight: the team’s elusive search for an NBA title, beginning with a home game against Utah.\n\nIf Denver is to return to the Western Conference finals — and stone-sling the Goliaths that are the Lakers en route to the NBA Finals — it will undoubtedly be because of Billups, rising to the occasion much like an Elway.\n\nEntering his second season in his second go-round with Denver, Billups said he knows his teammates’ tendencies even better, he knows how to better motivate and he knows what the Nuggets did to blow winnable games that they will need this season to get where they want to go.\n\n“Billups is a true quarterback, a true leader,” said new Timberwolves coach Kurt Rambis, a Lakers assistant last season. “He understands how to get his teammates involved, how to orchestrate an offense, how to manipulate a defense, how to keep his teammates happy and involved.”\n\nWith the Western Conference finals tied at 2-2 last spring, the Lakers rattled Denver in the final two games with swarming defense on pick-and-roll plays. Billups himself played poorly in the final two games, committing eight turnovers after making just six through the first four games.\n\nTo get to the Western Conference finals again, Billups will have to manage games like the seemingly flawless Kyle Orton, spreading the ball around and keeping everyone happy.\n\nBut to beat L.A. when it counts, Denver must get there first, which isn’t automatic considering the strength of the Western Conference this season.\n\n“It’s going to be harder than it was last year,” Billups said. “You can’t just wake up and think because we had a good year last year that teams are going to lay down; it’s the other way around. People are going to get more excited and put more into it — we’re going to get everyone’s ‘A’ game. We need to be a lot more focused throughout the season.”\n\nBillups as the teacher\n\n“SWING IT!”\n\nBillups barked at newcomer Arron Afflalo like John McEnroe sending back an uncooked steak.\n\nAfter a few moments of indecision, Afflalo finally passed the ball around the perimeter during Friday’s preseason game against the Lakers, and Billups continued to counsel Afflalo on the court — during the play.\n\nDuring the preseason, Billups spent much of his time counseling, be it with Afflalo or J.R. Smith, the talented but erratic young guard. Billups explained to “J.R. Swish” that he also needs to be “J.R. Stops” at the defensive end. Smith has the ability to be a 20-plus-point guy a night. If he can somehow improve his shooting percentage, as well as his man-to-man defense — while getting more minutes as a starter — Denver could be menacing.\n\n“I think I can have a great effect on J.R.,” Billups said. “At the end of the day, all I can do is talk to him and tell him about my experiences and what I think he should do. It’s on him to act on it. I trust that he’s going to change and do what’s right. He is a very, very vital part of this team that we’ve got to have going in the right direction.”\n\nBased on preseason play, the Nuggets are a work in progress, Smith included. They turned the ball over too much, for one, including Billups. But according to coach George Karl, it’s still the best preseason he has supervised in years, in part because his roster includes Billups and a bunch of guys who follow his star point guard’s lead.\n\nOutsiders haven’t seem impressed with Denver’s offseason moves, but Rambis said if the Nuggets can absorb the lessons of their loss to the Lakers in the playoffs, they could be as good or better this season.\n\n“There’s so much that teams learn from losing in the playoffs,” Rambis said. “They learn they have to continue to make sacrifices, they learn about their weaknesses offensively and defensively, and individuals go home and work on the weaknesses, so when they come back, they’re improved players, and an improved team.\n\n“I think what propelled the Lakers last season was losing to Boston (in the 2008 Finals) and getting creamed in that Game 6. They came back that last season and they were extremely coachable, everyone listened and did what they were told — and it made all the difference in the world for how we were prepared for the playoffs.”\n\nVintage aging\n\nThe George Washington High School prom was a long time ago.\n\nBillups turned 33 last month. At some point in his career, he’s going to slow down. Right? Karl said he will monitor Billups’ minutes this season and make sure he’s rested for the playoffs by utilizing Anthony Carter and rookie Ty Lawson.\n\nKarl likens Billups to Hall of Famer John Stockton, who was near 33 when Karl asked aloud if Stockton “would be a year better or a year older?” (Stockton went on to play in two NBA Finals in his mid-30s.)\n\n“He kept getting a year better,” Karl said of Utah’s legendary point guard. “(Billups) is not faster, stronger or bigger, but he’s smarter, cleverer, more team-oriented. As a leader and orchestrator of a team, Chauncey does it with his experiences, heart and head as much as with his skill.\n\n“His advantage is understanding score, time and how to win games. Basically, having positive energy. A lot of young players get into who’s taking shots, who’s getting minutes. Chauncey just wants the team to play well.”\n\nL.A. is the pick to repeat in the West, if not the NBA. ESPN analyst Jon Barry was asked if Denver had a shot of winning the West.\n\n“To me, L.A. is clear-cut the best team in the West, and I can’t see anyone unseating them — and San Antonio has the best shot,” Barry said.\n\nStill, one could argue the Nuggets have never had a better shot at the title, with the entire nucleus of a conference finals squad back, including rising star Carmelo Anthony.\n\nAnd their quarterback.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: 303-954-1294 or bhochman@denverpost.com\n\nTen things to watch in the NBA\n\nBy Chris Dempsey, The Denver Post\n\nExpanded use of instant replay\n\nInstant replay will be used in more situations than just to review shots at the end of a quarter. Now, fouls that are called with no time remaining on the clock at the end of any quarter can be reviewed. Also, flagrant foul-penalty 2 violations can be reviewed at any time during a game to make certain the call was warranted and to flesh out any unsportsmanlike acts that were committed before or after the FF2 was called.\n\nReal referees returning\n\nThe regular referees sat out the entire preseason while a new labor deal was negotiated with the NBA. Back with a two-year agreement, the veteran officials may get off to a rocky start because the preseason is also there for them to use a tuneup. They had a crash-course training camp a few days ago. It should be interesting to watch how long it takes for them to shake the rust off.\n\nShaq teams up with another star\n\nShaquille O’Neal sure knows how to pick ’em. He has played with Anfernee Hardaway (actually not his choice) as well as Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade and now LeBron James in Cleveland. Shaq, traded from Phoenix to the Cavaliers during the summer, is looking for his fifth NBA title.\n\nGarnett back in gear for Celtics\n\nAs much as the Celtics scratched and clawed to win games in the playoffs last season, they still won 62 games during the regular season. Kevin Garnett is back from a knee injury that sidelined him the entire postseason, and now the Celtics are 100 percent again. With their Big Three intact, the Celtics are Cleveland’s biggest threat.\n\nClass of 2010\n\nWill two superstars, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, tip their hands as to what their free-agent intentions are after the season? For some teams, this season is merely the appetizer to a 2010 free- agent class that can change the fortunes of any team dramatically.\n\nSpurs looking sharp\n\nThere was considerable slippage in San Antonio last season and the Spurs didn’t waste time in bolstering their roster. They traded for Richard Jefferson, signed Antonio McDyess and drafted DeJuan Blair, a bruising forward from Pittsburgh. Add to that the healthy return of veteran Manu Ginobili and it’s hard not to look at the Spurs as perhaps the primary threat to the Lakers in the Western Conference title race.\n\nGreg Oden watch\n\nThe former Ohio State star has been more injured than effective as a Portland big man, but during the preseason it looked like he had put all that behind him. Oden is healthy and has some of that Ohio State swagger back in his game. He won’t be asked to carry the Trail Blazers, but if he can average 12 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, the Blazers will be scary good.\n\nCoaches in pressure cookers\n\nThe Nuggets have one (George Karl). Portland has one (Nate McMillan). So does Orlando (Stan Van Gundy). As does Atlanta (Mike Woodson). All of these coaches lead teams with high expectations. They will receive a ton of heat if their teams don’t live up to the hype.\n\nAre the Lakers starting a dynasty?\n\nKobe Bryant just collected his fourth NBA championship and the Lakers look ready to get another title with the addition of veteran Ron Artest. Can the Lakers go back-to-back for the second time this decade? Is there any team that can slow the Purple and Gold Express?\n\nBlossoming stars\n\nThe NBA is filled with them. Here are a few to keep an eye on: Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant, Chicago’s Derrick Rose, Indiana’s Danny Granger, Sacramento’s Kevin Martin, Golden State’s Monta Ellis, Memphis’ O.J. Mayo and Rudy Gay, Houston’s Aaron Brooks and the Los Angeles Clippers’ Eric Gordon. Not to mention rookies Blake Griffin (Clippers), Jonny Flynn (Minnesota), Stephen Curry (Golden State), Tyreke Evans (Sacramento) and Brandon Jennings (Milwaukee). The NBA’s future looks bright.\n\nBreaking down the NBA, looking West and East\n\nFor the first time in years, look for the NBA’s Western Conference to thin out a bit toward the last two playoff teams, while the Eastern Conference looks for additional contenders to threaten Cleveland, Boston and Orlando. The Denver Post’s Chris Dempsey predicts both conference races:\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: Still the class of the NBA. Defending champions add Ron Artest and welcome a healthy Andrew Bynum.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: Veteran guard Andre Miller (pictured) added to budding superstar Brandon Roy and a talented mix.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Retooled roster includes Richard Jefferson, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair and a healthy Manu Ginobili.\n\nDenver Nuggets: Coach George Karl is counting on experience and improved play to keep the Nuggets among the West’s elite.\n\nUtah Jazz: Carlos Boozer and GM Kevin O’Connor are getting along, which helps the Jerry Sloan-coached Jazz, always among the contenders.\n\nDallas Mavericks: If Shawn Marion can regain his star form, the Mavericks figure to be dangerous.\n\nPhoenix Suns: Shaq is gone, but Steve Nash and Amar’e Stoudemire are healthy. That is good news for Phoenix.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Injured rookie Blake Griffin is out six weeks, but the talented Clippers are poised to make a playoff run.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: Emeka Okafor replaces Tyson Chandler, but the Hornets must find perimeter help to complement Chris Paul and David West.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant, Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook compose the nucleus of a team that’s better than you think.\n\nHouston Rockets: No Yao Ming, limited Tracy McGrady. Not enough big-time talent for the Rockets to survive.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Stephen Jackson isn’t happy, and a youthful team will find wins hard to come by.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: Allen Iverson is on the roster and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar may be added to the staff, but the Grizzlies have a ways to go.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: A broken hand will keep Kevin Love out two months, and there isn’t much more help on the roster for Al Jefferson.\n\nSacramento Kings: The roster is upgraded, but young. Kevin Martin is a budding star, but new coach Paul Westphal has his hands full.\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: Shaq headlines a reworked, more potent and versatile roster that could put Le- Bron James back in the NBA Finals.\n\nBoston Celtics: A healthy Kevin Garnett puts the Big Three back on the court together and vaults the Celtics into the race for an NBA Finals berth.\n\nOrlando Magic: Vince Carter replaces Hedo Turkoglu, but a healthy Jameer Nelson will boost this team back into title contention.\n\nChicago Bulls: Consistency will determine whether the Bulls are ready to move into the East’s elite.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: Al Horford is in line for a breakout season, but Josh Smith must be an elite player every night for the Hawks to thrive.\n\nWashington Wizards: Gilbert Arenas returns for new coach Flip Saunders, but the Wizards will have to survive up to five weeks without injured veteran Antawn Jamison.\n\nToronto Raptors: Turkoglu joins a motivated Chris Bosh and up-and-coming Andrea Bargnani.\n\nMiami Heat: Miami must find more productivity around Mr. Everything, Dwyane Wade.\n\nDetroit Pistons: Detroit has a new coach, new players and a long way back to the top.\n\nIndiana Pacers: Danny Granger is the best player no one talks about.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: Elton Brand is back, but Andre Iguodala must be a star for the Sixers to matter.\n\nNew York Knicks: They will be fun to watch, but they’re coasting until free agency after the season.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats: Larry Brown likes reclamation projects and the Bobcats continue to be one of his toughest ever.\n\nNew Jersey Nets: You can pay for Devin Harris or Brook Lopez to come to your house party, but no amount of money will buy 35 wins in New Jersey.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut are joined by flashy point guard Brandon Jennings.\n\nGetty Images photo"
