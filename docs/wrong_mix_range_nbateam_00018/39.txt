DENVER (AP) - Chauncey Billups scored 27 points, Aaron Afflalo matched his career high with 24 points and the depleted Denver Nuggets beat the Charlotte Bobcats 104-93 for their season-high seventh straight win.

Stephen Jackson had 22 points and Gerald Wallace added 20 for the Bobcats, who lost their third in a row since a franchise-tying 6-game winning streak.

The Nuggets were playing without leading scorer Carmelo Anthony, who sprained his left ankle in overtime Saturday against New Orleans. They lost forward Kenyon Martin to an ejection late in the second quarter when he argued with officials over a foul call against teammate J.R. Smith.

Early in the fourth quarter, Denver's Chris Anderson got his feet tangled underneath the basket going for a rebound and crashed to the floor.
