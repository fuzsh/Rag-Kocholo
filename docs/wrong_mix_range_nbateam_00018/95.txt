CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Stephen Jackson scored 23 points and the Charlotte Bobcats held off Denver 100-98 on Tuesday night to deny Nuggets coach George Karl his 1,000th NBA win.

Returning to North Carolina where he played in college and going up against his longtime friend and fellow former Tar Heel Larry Brown, Karl had hoped to become the seventh coach of the 1,000-win club in Charlotte.

The Nuggets nearly rallied from eight points down with 90 seconds left, but Chauncey Billups missed a tying jumper in the corner as time expired.

Billups scored 25 points and Carmelo Anthony added 22 points and seven rebounds for the Nuggets, who had won seven straight.

Gerald Wallace had 20 points and nine boards for Charlotte. Tyrus Thomas scored 16 before leaving left late in the fourth quarter with a tight left quadriceps.

Hawks 116, Nets 101

ATLANTA - Josh Smith scored a season-high 34 points to lead streaking Atlanta to another victory.

Smith, accurate with his outside jumper and inside game, made 14 of 16 shots from the field. When it was over, he blew kisses to the crowd.

The Hawks are 4-1 since losing top scorer Joe Johnson for four to six weeks to a right elbow injury and have won seven of eight overall.

Brook Lopez led New Jersey with 24 points. Devin Harris had 18 points and 13 assists.

76ers 117, Cavaliers 97

PHILADELPHIA - Thaddeus Young had a season-high 26 points and the 76ers picked up their fourth win in five games.
