There're, at least, two artists by this name.

AKA Kim Moyes (aka Kimberley Isaac Moyes, born 1976) is one half of a Sydney electronica two-piece, The Presets. He plays keyboard and drums. He also played Moog synthesizer for Sydney band Prop. Kim is also in the band The Dissociatives with Daniel Johns of Silverchair and producer Paul Mac. His producing credits include, but are not limited to The Valentinos and The Cops, both Sydney based bands. Kim played vibes on the soundtrack to the Australian film Somersault, with Sydney-based band Decoder Ring.

Kim lives in Camperdown, Sydney and has been associated with Los Angeles/Sydney based session drummer Felix X. Bloxsom, (who played drums on the Presets debut album Beams) and London/Sydney based theatre actor Sam Smith. Kim graduated from Sydney's Conservatorium of Music, and is currently working on a second Presets album and a Presets world tour. Kim's favourite food is Cadbury hazelnut chocolate and, aside from BJB Studio's owners, Chris Townend and Scott Horscroft, he is the only person allowed to hold a drink near the mixing desk. Kim works under the alias K.I.M (Kimberly Isaac Moyes) and makes original music and remixes. His solo release "System Breakdown" only released in Japan, however is easily bought online. It features "Wet n Wild", "By The Time They Reach You" and "Party Machini". Album art by Jonathan Zawada.

Kim has been accused of stealing lyrics and themes from such established artists as The Pixies, Michael Jackson, Enya and Peter Frampton. In response, Kim has labelled these indiscretions as "homages".

Kim once refused to DJ after a set by The Valentinos at Sydney's Club 77, citing his distaste for "rock and roll".
