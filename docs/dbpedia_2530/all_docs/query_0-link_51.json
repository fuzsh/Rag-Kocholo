        "text": "UPDATE, June 23: Due to the unsurprisingly overwhelming demand for tickets, a handful of new dates have just been added to The Presets' tour, with new shows bound for Torquay, Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle. This article has been updated to reflect that change. See the full list of dates below for all the details.\n\nWhen you've spent two decades doing something you love, turning it into a career and enjoying phenomenal success with it, you're allowed to get nostalgic about how things began. Back in February, The Presets did just that, returning to the Sydney venue where they started out for a one-night-only rave-cave gig. The Club 77 club set clearly struck a chord with Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes, so much so that it's no longer a once-off. Across more than 20 shows, the duo will be taking things back to where they all began again, playing small clubs and bars around the country from July–October.\n\nThe tour is set to kick off in Victoria, then head through Queensland and pinball between New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, too. So, fans can catch The Presets at venues such as Frankston's Pier Bandroom, Friday's Riverside in Brisbane, Magnums Hotel in Airlie Beach and the Dee Why RSL in Sydney. If you've seen the duo bust out their festival sets across Australia and the world, or their audiovisual-heavy own solo shows, that isn't what you're in for this time around.\n\n\"We've been lucky enough to play the biggest stages and festivals in the world over the past 20 years,\" explains Moyes, announcing the tour.\n\n\"But nothing compares to the buck-wild intensity of an intimate party. They are an entirely different beast and we can't wait to unleash over these 20 nights.\"\n\n\"DJing in small clubs is a whole different experience to performing our usual live show on the big stage with the lights and visuals and things like that,\" adds Hamilton.\n\n\"It is more freewheeling and immediate — we feed off the energy of the crowd, weaving our own tracks in with classic jams by our favourite artists. So it's a 20 years celebration of not only our music, but also all the incredible tunes that inspire us. Plus we get a chance to throw in a few unreleased surprises too.\"\n\nExpect hits from The Presets' hefty back catalogue, tracks you've never heard before and also different handpicked special guests each night. Who'll join the duo is yet to be revealed.\n\nAs well as celebrating where their time as The Presets began, plus giving tracks like 'My People', 'Are You the One?', 'This Boy's in Love' and 'Talk Like That' a whirl, the aim is to make each night a completely different experience. Go hard then go home, obviously.\n\nTHE PRESETS DJ TOUR: 20 YEARS. 20 NIGHTS.\n\nThursday, July 13 — Torquay Hotel, Torquay — NEW\n\nFriday, July 14 — Village Green Hotel, Mulgrave — SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, July 15 — Pier Bandroom, Frankston — SOLD OUT\n\nThursday, July 20 — Beach Hotel, Byron Bay\n\nFriday, July 21 — Friday's Riverside, Brisbane — SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, July 22 — Kings Beach Tavern, Caloundra — SOLD OUT\n\nFriday, July 28 — Burleigh Bazaar, Gold Coast\n\nSaturday, July 29 — C.EX, Coffs Harbour\n\nFriday, August 4 — Shoal Bay Country Club, Shoal Bay\n\nSaturday, August 5 — Drifters Wharf, Central Coast — SOLD OUT\n\nThursday, August 10 — Gilligan's, Cairns\n\nFriday, August 11 — Kirwan Tavern (outdoors), Townsville\n\nSaturday, August 12 — Magnums Hotel, Airlie Beach\n\nFriday, August 18 — Beer Deluxe, Albury\n\nSaturday, August 19 — Torquay Hotel, Torquay — SOLD OUT\n\nFriday, August 25 — UOW Uni Bar, Wollongong — SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, August 26 — Kambri Anu, Canberra\n\nWednesday, August 30 — The Station, Perisher\n\nThursday, August 31 — Miranda Hotel, Sydney — NEW\n\nFriday, September 1 — Miranda Hotel, Sydney — SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, September 2 — Dee Why RSL, Sydney — SOLD OUT\n\nSunday, September 3 — Dee Why RSL, Sydney — NEW\n\nSunday, September 7 — The Espy, Melbourne — NEW\n\nSaturday, September 9 — Monsoons, Darwin\n\nSaturday, September 16 - The Espy, Melbourne — SOLD OUT\n\nSaturday, October 21 — Freo Social, Fremantle — NEW\n\nThe Presets are touring Australia from July–October 2023.
