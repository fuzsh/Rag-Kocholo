        "text": "The Kim Moyes produced track is an intriguing shoegazey delight\n\nEvery day we highlight great new music added to the Double J playlist.\n\nNew to Double J? Here's how you can tune in, no matter where you are.\n\nIs dream pop still dreamy if it's also really punchy? Sydney artist Moody Beach (aka Melissah Mirage) proves the answer is yes on her glorious new single 'Why Not'.\n\nEnormous drums really cut through everything on this track, but they somehow do so without getting in the way.\n\nMirage's vocal sits back almost as far as the sweetly droning synth and tinny rhythm guitar, which sounds as though it's being thrashed with fury, while the snare drum bashes us in the chest in a slow but measured way.\n\nThanks to Mirage's melodic nous, this assemblage of largely aggressive sounds still leaves us feeling wistful. Her songwriting and performance strong enough to pull this from ratty bedroom grunge to wondrous shoegaze with apparent ease.\n\nThe furious nature of the performance is no happenstance: it fits perfectly with the song's theme.\n\n\"'Why Not' is about unfulfilled desire towards a person who is off-limits; how this desire muddles the brain and your capacity to think and act logically,\" Mirage says of the song in a statement.\n\n\"To me, desire is one of the most primal human instincts. I revelled in the feeling and had a lot of fun writing the song. It was the perfect outlet and a cathartic release.\"\n\nAlso, shoutout to Kim Moyes of The Presets, who produced this track. Here's hoping that partnership continues through 2021."
