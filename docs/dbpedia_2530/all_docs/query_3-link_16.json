        "text": "This week in The Lab SYD we’re joined by multiple ARIA award winning producer, and one half of iconic Australian electronic duo The Presets , Kim Moyes aka K.I.M .\n\nBased in Sydney, the established solo musician/record producer has an extensive list of 12”s and EPs to his name, with releases arriving via Cutters Records, Modular Recordings, Rallya-Klee (Japan), Bang Gang 12 Inches and Motorik! Records, to name a few.\n\nK.I.M is also no stranger to collabs, working as a producer and songwriter for the likes of Digitalism, Kirin J. Callinan, Jack Ladder & The Dreamlanders and Riot In Belgium. Having produced music and performed live locally and internationally for over 20 years, it’s no surprise he‘s created stand-out remixes for Kings Of Leon, Cassius, The Drones, Bag Raiders, Midnight Juggernaughts and Flash & The Pan. For the last two years he has been seen touring his hybrid live/DJ show across Australia, whist working on The Presets’ fourth studio album alongside band-mate Julian Hamilton.\n\nWith further remixes due for The Jezabels, The Drones and The Avalanches, and preparations to launch a record label with veteran Melbourne DJ and one half of Zero Percent, Mike Callander, underway, 2017 is set to be a huge year for K.I.M.\n\nDue to the glorious Sydney weather, this week's Lab SYD will be broadcast from the later time of 6:30pm (AEST) this Friday, November 11. You can watch the set in full over on our Facebook page."
