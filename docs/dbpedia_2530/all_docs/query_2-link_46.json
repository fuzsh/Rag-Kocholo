        "text": "THE TESKEY BROTHERS\n\nIt’s fair to say The Teskey Brothers have come a long way since shows in small Melbourne bars just a few years ago. The four friends from Warrandyte have seen a meteoric rise in popularity, amassing a legion of fans all around the world with their timeless recordings and stunning live shows.\n\nThe band’s debut Half Mile Harvest captured cult-like attention with it’s affectionate nod to the blues and soul of the Stax era. Then arrived 2019’s Run Home Slow, expanding the palette to include elements of southern rock, Americana, psychedelia, Dixieland jazz, gospel and a striking pop number in single ‘So Caught Up’. Both albums have been loved by millions around the world, earning The Teskey Brothers three ARIA Awards, four Music Victoria Awards, a Grammy Nomination and an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Show.\n\nOnstage The Teskeys pull out all stops, conjuring a rare soulful energy and raw emotion that has fans queuing for tickets across USA, Canada, UK and Europe. Josh Teskey’s once-in-a-generation voice defying belief as the band ignites around him. In 2019, The Teskey Brothers played four nights at Melbourne’s Forum Theatre and recorded the shows to analogue tape. The resulting live album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Album chart this year and has been described by American Songwriter magazine as “a near perfect live recording”.\n\nThe Teskey Brothers’ Bluesfest appearance in 2018 was one of their most memorable live performances to date and they are thrilled to be making a return in 2022.\n\nJOHN BUTLER (John Butler Trio)\n\nJohn Butler remains one of the most successful independent artists in Australia’s history. His band, the John Butler Trio, have sold out a myriad of performances over the years in Australia and have gone on to take their music worldwide. John Butler has an impressive one million album sales to his name, has been the No. 1 most played artist on Australian radio and has numerous ARIA awards to write home about.\n\nHaving played on countless festivals across the globe, John Butler Trio are in constant demand, after developing an earnest reputation as one of the best live blues and roots acts to this day. Their recent ARIA award winning album, Flesh & Blood, was released globally in February 2014. This then took them to sold out shows in Australia, Europe & North America, then remarkably saw them play their largest ever headline ticketed show at the famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre (Colorado) in front of nearly 10,000 people. John Butler Trio continues to capture their fans and take them on an organic journey.\n\nHOLY HOLY\n\nOn the incessant and electric cut The Aftergone, Holy Holy partners with sisterly duo CLEWS and The Presets’ Kim Moyes. “Working with Kim was fun and I've always loved The Presets. We wanted to push this song into electronic territory, and he was the right person to go to for that,” says Oscar Dawson. “Tim then wrote a pre-chorus melody and lyrics that we felt were perfect for Lily and Grace from CLEWS, a band - and people - we're super fond of. We've toured with them and they've joined us on stage many times before. We’re stoked that they can finally feature on a song with us.” Of the lyrics, Tim Carroll adds, \"The future has been feeling particularly uncertain lately. The world we thought we knew is not there anymore. This song is an acknowledgement of what that feels like. Maybe things are always like that. Maybe every generation has this experience, and this is just our story to live through.\" Recorded in a series of modest studios and spare rooms in Tasmania and Victoria, Holy Holy’s fourth album, Hello My Beautiful World is perhaps their most fully realised. Built upon a foundation of electronic beats and rolling synths, the record combines lush string arrangements, May-esque guitar riffs and chanted vocals to produce a heady and persuasive mix. The record moves fluidly through a collection of feverish moods and atmospheres, unfolding unpredictably and building to a series of fierce and manic highs. It’s a dense and ambitious record suited to close and repeated listening.\n\nBOY & BEAR\n\n2019 saw Boy & Bears triumphant return to the international touring circuit to promote the release of their album ‘Suck on Light’ which was rated by triple j’s Richard Kingsmill in his top 10 albums of the year. An acoustic album of some of their favourite tracks followed in September 2020, with the band returning to the studio to write more music for an expected release in 2021.\n\nCelebrated for their unique sound, rich harmonies, and trademark warmth and charisma, Boy & Bear take to stages around Australia late summer delivering the musicianship and connection that their live audiences have come to love throughout their career.\n\n“We cannot wait to be playing together again, alongside other great Australian live bands, in what will be the biggest outdoor Australian tour this summer.” - Dave Hosking.\n\nKASEY CHAMBERS\n\nThere’s a moment in most artists’ young lives when they realise music will shape their future and define who they are. Kasey Chambers didn’t have to wait for that moment to arrive. Music is part of her DNA.\n\nThe Captain (1999) remains one of the most extraordinary and lauded debuts by an Australian artist in any genre. Songs such as the title track, ‘Cry Like a Baby’ and ‘These Pines’ boast a maturity beyond her years and a wealth of Americana-styled musical influences, yet the album has Australia and family at its core, ingredients that have been a staple of Kasey’s song-writing ever since then. The critics and the public saw The Captain for what it was, a blast of fresh air in the local country scene. Kasey was on her way and picked up her first ARIA Awards, for best country album and best female artist.\n\nGreater success was to follow. Barricades & Brickwalls (2001), Kasey’s second album, broke more ground, winning best album at the 2002 ARIAs and landing her at the top of the pop charts in Australia and the third album, Wayward Angel (2004) was another monster success, going straight to No.1 in Australia and producing a string of singles. Kasey’s fourth album, Carnival, debuted at No.1 in August 2006. In 2005 Kasey married fellow musician and songwriter Shane Nicholson and this partnership would form the basis of her next success with their debut as a duo, Rattlin’ Bones (2008), another No.1 debut on the album charts and it won best country album at the ARIAs in 2008. In 2009 family was once again a big influence on Kasey’s music with the following albums Kasey Chambers, Poppa Bill and the Little Hillbillies that won best independent country album at the AIR Awards in 2010, her fifth solo album Little Bird released in September 2010 that peaked at No.3, and a time for reflection captured in her album Storybook.\n\nMONTAIGNE\n\nThe voice of the new generation, Sydney based artist Montaigne (born Jess Cerro) at only 24 has become a major name in Aussie indie music. The past few years have seen her recognised for her work with multiple spots on the triple j’s Hottest 100, an ARIA award for ‘Best Breakthrough Artist’ and a further nomination for ‘Best Female Artist’ in 2016, plus J-Award nominations. Her debut album ‘Glorious Heights’ (produced by Tony Buchen) hit the charts at #4 and her sophomore album ‘COMPLEX’ was released in 2019 to rave reviews. Singles such as ‘Ready’ gained extensive commercial radio play and propelled her even further into prominence. As Craig Mathieson of the Sydney Morning Herald put it, ‘Montaigne creates music that has a thrilling waywardness, baroque pomp and storm-the-stage energy.’\n\nJust off her third national tour, Montaigne has played notable festivals like Splendour in the Grass, Lost Paradise, Woodford Folk Festival, Groovin the Moo, Party in the Paddock, Field Day and WOMADelaide. Having opened for international acts like Cindy Lauper and Blondie, this young performer continues to garner high praise for her stunning live presence. ‘Her performance will go down as one of the best concerts of the year, without a doubt,’ wrote The Music of her most recent Sydney show, ‘and we were lucky to bear witness to the chrysalis.’\n\nHaving just taken out the Eurovision: Australia Decides 2020 competition, Montaigne will be bringing her latest single ‘Don’t Break Me’ to represent Australia on the world stage at Rotterdam in May of next year. Her challenging and inspiring lyrics are reminiscent of the philosopher who inspired her moniker. With melodies to get lost in, and the most energetic of live performances - Montaigne represents the next generation of artists who march to the beat of their own drum.\n\nEMILY WURRAMARA\n\nOriginally from Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory, growing up Emily loved hearing her uncles sing, but also realised that women from her community rarely sang in public. Wanting to inspire and empower members of her community, especially young Indigenous women, to find their voice, Emily embarked on a musical journey that has touched the hearts and minds of audiences across Australia and internationally.\n\nEmily’s debut album received an ARIA nomination and AIR award for Best Blues and Roots Album. She is a 6 times Queensland Music Award winner and has toured extensively across Australia, Canada and Ireland.\n\nLITTLE QUIRKS\n\nThey’ve got the hooks, the harmonies and the explosive live energy, but if there’s one thing Little Quirks are missing, it’s a good fake ID. With the youngest of the three band members drummer Mia being just 16 years of age, Little Quirks have become adept at sweet talking door security to get into their own gigs.\n\nDespite their age, this Central Coast family band has clocked up seven years of musical experience together since they began to hone their craft busking at local farmers markets. In recent years you would find Abbey, Mia and Jaymi charming crowds at music festivals and venues up and down the East Coast, sharing stages with artists such as The Teskey Brothers, The Preatures, Xavier Rudd, Ruby Fields, Tim Rogers and Alex the Astronaut.\n\nA Little Quirks live performance is something to behold. There is a rare, unaffected honesty to their approach as they layer catchy-as-all-hell folk and pop melodies atop a relentless pounding beat. Audiences have no choice but to smile as the band dances to their own driving rhythms with a youthful exuberance that is simply undeniable."
