        "text": "Name: Kim Moyes\n\nLocation: Sydney, Australia\n\nAge: Old enough to know I don’t have to answer this question.\n\nThe Presets have been one of Modular Records‘ defining acts since their debut studio album, Beams. With an army of remixes under their belt and an arsenal of synthesizers in their warchest, it should come as no surprise to learn that their history with music involves far more than just the styles they’re known for. Multi-instumentalist Kim Moyes’ side-project, K.I.M., has held our attention for years with his deeply personal, genre-ambiguous focus. Since an international Presets tour is on the way, we reached out to him to shed some light on his musical experiences.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nKIM’s latest EP “Kloser” is out now on Motorik Records\n\nWhen and why did you decide to launch KIM?\n\nI started releasing music as ‘KIM’ or ‘K.I.M’ in 2005, my first release was on Cut Copy’s Cutters label, it was called “System Breakdown” and the B Side was “Wet n Wild,” it was Cutters’ first release as well. I felt I had good tunes that weren’t necessarily fitting into the Presets repertoire, so I just found a home for them and was lucky enough to get them out to the public.\n\nWhat makes KIM different from The Presets?\n\nFor starters it’s a solo project, I generally don’t collaborate when it’s a KIM thing. It can be more club orientated or more ambient in focus than the Presets generally is.\n\nWhat upcoming projects are you working on? (That you can talk about.)\n\nAt the moment I’m deep in new Presets material, which is all sounding really great. The Jack Ladder & The Dreamlanders record I produced called “Playmates” is coming out very shortly.\n\nWhat’s your production setup?\n\nI was lucky enough to build my own studio in 2010. I have too much gear and instruments lying around. I work mainly in Pro Tools HD and Ableton on a desktop. I have a live room for recording instruments, players and ambience. I also work on a laptop sometimes.\n\nWhat’s the first song you ever loved?\n\n“Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds.\n\nWhat are the first two songs you ever mixed together?\n\nCan’t remember.\n\nWhat is your worst guilty pleasure song?\n\nI don’t believe in feeling guilty about liking a song, but having said that, “Cherish” by Kool & The Gang makes me feel squirmy and uneasy in not an entirely bad way.\n\nWhat song have you had on repeat in the last month?\n\n“Digital Love” by Daft Punk.\n\nWhich track of your own do you love the most?\n\nI recently a finished a remix of “Midnight Man” by Flash & The Pan that I’m quite happy with.\n\nWhat do you think is the best makeout song?\n\n“Blue In Green” by Miles Davis.\n\nWhat track of your own do you hate the most?\n\nThere comes a point when working on your own music where you start to become numb to its effect, but I would never say that I hate any of them.\n\nWhat track are you most excited to drop in a sets?\n\n“Ikizukuri” by Simian Mobile Disco & Roman Flugel.\n\nWhat’s your favourite track that you wish worked in a set?\n\n“Shake Your Head (Let’s Go To Bed)” by Was (Not Was).\n\nWhat’s the last song you want to hear before the lights go on?\n\n“All Night Long” by Lionel Richie is almost always a great way to end a party."
