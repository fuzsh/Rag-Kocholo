        "text": "Australian dance act The Presets has capped off a stellar year with two songs featuring in the top 10 of the annual Triple J Hottest 100.\n\nAmerican rock group Kings of Leon topped the poll with Sex on Fire, but it was Empire of the Sun that was the highest ranked Aussie band, coming in at number four with Walking On A Dream.\n\nThe Presets came in at number six, with Talk Like That, and again at number eight with This Boy's in Love.\n\nThe Sydney-based duo of Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes dominated last year's ARIAs, scooping up eight awards, and becoming the first electro act to score Album of the Year.\n\nKings of Leon, touring Australia in March, made a further three appearances in the line-up with Use Somebody (3), Closer (24) and Crawl (70).\n\nA third mention was given to The Presets in the traditional Australia Day countdown, broadcast from Sydney's Parramatta Park, with Yippiyo-Ay sliding in at number 56.\n\nAs well as The Presets and Empire of the Sun, other Aussie acts to make the top 10 were hip hop outfits Pez, at number seven with The Festival Song, and Drapht's Jimmy Recard at number 10.\n\nElectric-rockers MGMT scored a couple of top 10 mentions - Electric Feel was third and Kids took out the fifth spot.\n\nA record number of Triple J listeners registered their opinions for the 2009 line-up, with the radio network collecting 800,000 online votes.\n\nTriple J music director Richard Kingsmill said three acts \"really owned'' 2008.\n\n\"It was always going to be a tussle between Kings of Leon, The Presets and new guns MGMT for the top spots,'' he said."
