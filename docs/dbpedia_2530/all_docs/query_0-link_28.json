        "text": "Aussie synth-poppers The Presets release a sophomore album Apocalypso this month. The album, which went straight to number one in the charts in Australia upon release, was written and recorded at hippie retreat Byron Bay and also in Berlin during the downtime of a European tour. The tracks are billed as ranging from emotive techno (new single ‘This Boy’s In Love, YouTubed below) to pop (‘Talk Like That’) to abstract futurism (‘A New Sky’). \"There are a few songs on Apocalypso that have been informed by our live shows in terms of their energy,” says Preset Kim Moyes. “After two and a bit years of touring we really found out what we liked playing and what works well live, but the album as a whole however is not all bangers, there are some very delicate moments too.\" Tracklist 01 Kicking and Screaming? 02 My People? 03 A New Sky? 04 This Boy's in Love? 05 Yippiyo-ay? 06 Talk Like That? 07 Eucalyptus? 08 If I Know You 09 Together? 10 Aeons? 11 Anywhere ’Apocalypso’ by The Presets will be released on Modular on May 16th in the US and June 2nd in the UK."
