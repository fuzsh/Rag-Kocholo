This biography of Virginia Hall reads like Nancy Drew on steroids. Ms. Hall tried to have a career in the State Department, but met with good old boy discrimination everywhere she went. Finally she got placed with the British Secret Service where her six (!) languages served her well…but first she had been an ambulance driver in the French Army (shades of Hemingway). She served with the OSS and CIA and was not just incredibly lucky…she was very, very good. I could say a lot more but that would be a spoiler so get it and block out a chunk of time, you’ll need it.\n\nCarole recommends:\n\nThe Giver of Stars by JoJo Moyes\n\nIt’s 1937 and an Englishwoman relocated to Kentucky by an emotionally distant husband, joins the Horseback Librarians of Kentucky, a group put together by Eleanor Roosevelt in to distribute “knowledge” to rural Kentuckians. This is an engaging story based on true historical facts and I loved it! Not only does it give us a glimpse of life in rural America before the war but it also shows what life was like for women long before women’s lib hit the scene.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nThe Spaces Between Us by Stacia Tolman\n\nThe Spaces Between Us is a YA novel that kept surprising and intriguing me, all the way through. Serena Velasco, the smart and smart-mouthed heroine, lives in a small town in Maine where the local factory has closed down, and people seem trapped by economics and the assumptions made by others and themselves. Her best friend has as many contradictions as her name, Melody Grimshaw. The book itself is sometimes grim but also has descriptive passages of stunning beauty. Serena’s first-person narration is at times laugh-out-loud funny. The book crosses genres, so at times it’s a mystery, at others a romance. And it’s a school story, too, with Serena’s conflicts with teachers and the principal, who happens to be Serena’s mother. Recommended for older teens, although there is enough depth here that I think many adults would enjoy the novel as well.\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nWWW: Wake by Robert J. Sawyer\n\nThis is a fascinating book that explores the meaning of consciousness and sentience. The friendships between both Caitlin and the web intelligence, and Shoshana and Hobo (a chimp-bonobo hybrid) are really engaging and interesting.\n\nA blind girl named Caitlin gets an experimental implant that will supposedly give her sight, but instead lets her see directly onto the World Wide Web. Slowly she becomes aware of a consciousness that has spontaneously emerged from the web. Caitlin shows the consciousness how to use the internet to learn, and they eventually learn to communicate with each other. There is also a great story line about Hobo, who communicates in sign language and paints portraits of Shoshana (a chimp language researcher).\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nHarry Potter Complete 8-Film Series (DVDs)\n\nThese movies bring the world of Harry Potter to life. I highly recommend you read the books AND listen to the audiobooks narrated by Jim Dale then watch the movies. I’ve been binging all three formats for years. They are just that good.\n\nMe by Elton John\n\nPurely delightful. Elton John in his own words. Find out what made him who he is. Hint: he wasn’t always a prima dona.\n\nValerie recommends:\n\nBig Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace\n\nWilliam Bloom has had to listen to all of his father’s tall tales for decades. When his father is diagnosed with a fatal disease, he endeavors to get the true stories from his father before it’s too late. I love this book because I cherish storytelling, and know storytellers like the father in this book.\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nShortest Way Home by Pete Buttigieg\n\nPete Buttigieg, born in Indiana in 1982, is currently serving his second term as mayor of South Bend , Indiana. A Rhodes Scholar and Navy veteran, he was educated at Harvard and Oxford. The book narrates the heroic transformation of a “dying city” [Newsweek] into nothing less than a shining model of urban reinvention. The Shortest Way Home is a lucky day pick at the library with many requests for it. I offer no political opinion, simply doing homework for the upcoming presidential election. I had an uncle that was a mayor.\n\nI also recommend these CD’S played on KNYO102.7 & KNYO.ORG this past Friday. They were:\n\nAtmospheres by Caribbean Retreat (CD) a festive celebration as steel drums and other authentic instruments evoke the lively spirit of the islands.\n\nBirds of Fire by Mahavishnu Orchestra (CD) a jazz-rock fusion of music played by great accomplished musicians like John McLaughlin playing guitar and group leader.\n\nTimepieces by Eric Clapton. The best of Eric Clapton.\n\nCheck out The Library Hour with Dennis Dias every Friday @ 2 pm on KNYO 102.7 & KNYO.org.\n\nNovember 2019 Picks\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nThe Stranger Inside by Lisa Unger\n\nAfter a traumatic ordeal, three childhood friends are split, in more ways than one. A riveting psychological thriller. Not just a cheap read, either. Ms. Unger has packed this novel with a lot of information and timely research. Kept me on my toes and I found I couldn’t put it down.\n\nThis is Lisa Unger’s seventeenth novel. Why haven’t I found her before this?\n\nFreeing Finch by local author, Ginny Rorby\n\nEleven-year-old Finch has lost her mother, has an absent father and a secret she’s afraid to let out. In the face of adversity, Finch and the stray dog she tries to befriend have to overcome adversity to find love, home and acceptance. Ginny Rorby has done an excellent job capturing the essence of what it’s like to be an eleven-year-old coming of age in a rural area where it’s hard to find where you belong especially in a time of great diversity. And it’s fun to recognize all the local places!\n\nKim recommends:\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nInkheart by Cornelia Funke\n\nInkheart is about stories and the power of stories. When Meggie’s father reads aloud, objects and even characters literally come to life out of the story. But the price is that something (or someone) must take their place in the book. I could see myself in Meggie because I love books just as much as she does, and I love her relationship with her dad. This book is beautiful, fun, creative, and perfect for anyone who loves stories.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nThe Best of Damon Runyon: Fifteen stories by Damon Runyon\n\nThis book was published in 1945 and I always like his stories. I thought I had read this book about ten years ago, but I hadn’t and I was very glad to find new stories. Many of the characters (most) were familiar because I had read a book of his stories and listened to the Damon Runyon Theater radio show. This one is a page turner that will have you looking for more! Enjoy.\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nBrief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (Available at Fort Bragg Library in large print as a LUCKY DAY PICK.)\n\nStephen Hawking, the author, is the most renowned scientist since Einstein. Hawking is known both for his ground breaking work in physics and cosmology and his mischievous sense of humor. I found the book intriguing and very interesting in that Hawking answers the ten most asked questions not in complicated mathematical equations, but in simple language anyone can understand and does so within a concise two hundred pages. 1. Is there a God? 2. How did it begin? 3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe? 4. Can we predict the future? 5. What is a black hole? 6. Is time travel possible? 7. Will we survive on earth? 8. Should we colonize space? 9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? 10. How do we shape the future? Stephen Hawking has done research with a thousand top scientists from around the world. I think readers will find the explanations to the questions as fascinating as I did!\n\nBelow are some CDs available for check out that I had fun playing Friday at 2 pm on KNYO 107.7 FM and KNYO.ORG.\n\nJoe Cool’s Blues by Wynton and Ellis Marsalis a CD of Charlie Brown theme music.\n\nThe Best of the ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND (Allman Brothers Band).\n\nLIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL (Beatles).\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nDoctor Sleep by Stephen King\n\nMaybe the best sequel ever written. Red rum. Red rum.\n\nI vowed to never read Stephen King again (perhaps I’ve already whined about this to you), but Mr. King said a few years back that he was no longer going to write novels and was only going to write monthly articles for Entertainment Weekly, so I purchased a subscription and waited for my monthly dose. And then the prolific turkey noodle went and started writing more novels— peeved me off. And I was stuck with a stupid subscription to EW. Kill me now.\n\nAnyway, I tiny-bit forgave him a few months ago and have read probably five of the thousands he’s written since the EW fiasco, Doctor Sleep being the best!\n\nLittle Danny Torrance is all growed up and having settled into his gift, finds himself mixed up in the battle between the not-so-nice True Knots and the powerful twelve-year-old Abra—the shine is strong with that one. It is spectacular and as terrifying as it should be.\n\nThe Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains by Neil Gaiman Audiobook\n\nYou ask me if I can forgive myself? I can forgive myself . . .\n\nAnd so begins a plaguing story of family, the otherworld, and a search for hidden treasure.\n\n. . . for many things. For where I left him. For what I did.\n\nI didn’t read this, I listened to it on a hard road trip to say goodbye. Neil Gaiman reads his own brilliant story accompanied by an original score from FourPlay String Quartet, and it haunts you while it becomes your new favorite thing. I suggest you borrow it for all of your holiday travels over the river and through the woods. You will thank me.\n\nPlanes, Trains, and Automobiles DVD\n\nStill one of the funniest, heartfelt films ever. EVER. If you’ve never seen this, Steve Martin and John Candy are at their best, you will not be disappointed. And if you have seen it—well—you know. So, watch it again.\n\nHome for the Holidays DVD\n\nEvery one of your family members is portrayed in this hysterical family flick about going home and not wanting to.\n\nOctober 2019 Picks\n\nKim recommends:\n\nWe Are the Perfect Girl by Ariel Kaplan\n\nWe Are the Perfect Girl is a gender-flipped contemporary YA version of Cyrano de Bergerac, and so it’s a little like the ’90s movie The Truth About Cats and Dogs. Narrator Aphra is big-nosed and witty, while her best friend Bethany is shy and beautiful. They both have a crush on Greg, who’s handsome, kind, athletic, and able to speak six languages, yet not perfect. When Aphra pretends to be a chatbot to keep from failing a school assignment to design an app, the triangle gets more complicated. The novel manages to address the topic of body image, provide a likable and believable family for Aphra, and keep the reader wanting more, despite the formula concept. Aphra is hilarious, but she’s not the only one who’s quotable. This book is like the cupcakes that the characters keep eating: sweet fluff with heft and depth.\n\nAmie recommends:\n\nAmerican Predator by Maureen Callahan\n\nHave you heard of Israel Keyes? Me either.\n\nIsrael Keyes is the creepiest serial killer to date (probably). His MO was to not have an MO. How do you protect yourself from that?!?\n\nFor fifteen years (as far as we know), he traveled the United States, Canada, Mexico, and a few spots abroad—freaking killing people. Torturing and killing people. And was only caught by a fluke.\n\nGreat.\n\nAnd the only way the FBI knew was because he told them. How the heck do you outsmart the smartest people in law enforcement?\n\nRead it, then have nightmares for the rest of your life and be suspicious of everyone, even me. Mwahahaha.\n\nRocketman (DVD)\n\nI didn’t think I’d like it and I was right: I LOVED IT! I’m still singing. Be ready to sing. And I didn’t even hate the kid who played him.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nThe Long Call by Ann Cleeves\n\nI was saddened when I found out Ann Cleeves wasn’t going to write any more Shetland books and pouted when she said she was introducing a new detective. I didn’t want to like this new series because I love Vera Stanhope and Jimmy Perez. But, alas, I not only liked it, I couldn’t put it down! True to her other detectives, Ms Cleeves writes Matthew Venn as if she knew him personally. I look forward to many more mysteries with these new characters.\n\nAn Irish Country Doctor by Patrick Taylor\n\nMy recently deceased mother loved this Irish Country Doctor series. Up to now, I’ve avoided them, thought they might be too simple or trite. But when she passed away I decided to give them a try, maybe to be closer to her or maybe just because Ireland was one of our favorite places to be together. I don’t know. I just know I loved this one and look forward to reading the rest.\n\nSecret Life of Pets 2 (DVD)\n\nI loved the first one so much, I had to see this one. And it didn’t disappoint.\n\nMax the terrier has a lot of life changes to cope with, not the least of which is facing his own fears. But after spending time with Rooster, the farm dog, he is ready for anything. Can Max put aside his own inhibitions to save the life of another? Watch it to find out! My favorite thing about these movies is how right on they are with the animals’ behavior. Watching a bored cat bat at the door stop to make it boing, over and over and over, was perfect. I have a cat who does this on a daily basis. Cracked me up!\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nBasic Essentials Using GPS by Bruce Grubbs (who holds airline transport Pilot and Instrument Flight Instructor Certificates.)\n\nPut away those bulky books and monster manuals. Learn how to use Global Positioning System to navigate on land and water in a convenient seventy two page paperback.\n\nGalaxy by James Geach\n\nClear, comprehensive and superbly illustrated, GALAXY is an unforgettable guide to the mysteries of the cosmos. It is certain to appeal to stargazers everywhere with 1 08 color illustrations. In fourteen billion years we now have hundreds of billions of galaxies in the observable universe, each containing hundreds of billions of suns.\n\nA great follow up to the book Galaxy is a DVD entitled Into the Universe with the world’s most famous scientific mind, Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University. This video is the ultimate guide to the universe, a fantastic adventure based on real science- spanning the whole of space and time.\n\nBlackbeard: terror at sea (DVD)\n\nBlackbeard: terror at sea , a non-fiction National Geographic, is my next pick for factual information. The legend is real and if you like Pirates of the Caribbean or author Patrick O’Brian you will enjoy the DVD as much as I did.\n\nBlackbeard: terror at sea features sea chases, cannon battles and swordplay. Blackbeard, Englishman Edward Teach captured forty ships in two years. A pirate was an excellent sailor. Democracy was the way of business on board. Pirates voted on everything including who was captain.\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nFour of a Kind by Erma Bombeck\n\nIncludes The Grass is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank, If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries–What Am I Doing in the Pits?, Aunt Erma’s Cope Book–How to Get from Monday to Friday…in 12 Days and Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession\n\nErma Bombeck is extremely funny in a cynical but realistic way. I remember a story she wrote titled The Week the House Died, in which every appliance gave up at the same time. Water heater, dryer, washer, all gave up the ghost but she managed to relate the tale so that the reader was not only sympathetic but also amused. I also recall one in which she is exasperated with her almost adult children still at home and one of them suggests she motivate them to get their own lives. Empty nest, and the ongoing joys of home ownership. Very funny. Even for renters like me.\n\nValerie recommends:\n\nSignificance by Shelly Crane (Only available on Hoopla)\n\nMaggie is a seventeen-year-old getting over her first real break-up. On her way over to her friend’s house, she ends up saving a guy’s life. The moment she touches his hand, powerful emotions and hidden abilities begin to surface. She never knew that soulmates existed, and now she can’t decide if it’s a burden or a blessing. I like this series because it takes the concept of soulmates and gives it a supernatural twist.\n\nAfter the End by Amy Plum\n\nWorld War III has devastated the earth, but a lucky few make their way to rural Alaska where the radiation and war hasn’t ravaged the land. Juneau is one of the acclaimed hunters of her group. One day after a hunt, she hears a helicopter overhead and runs home to find that all of her people were taken. As she journeys to find them, she discovers that her parents and elders had been keeping secrets from all of the younger people. I enjoyed this series because it had extreme plot twists right from the beginning.\n\nSeptember 2019 Picks\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nA Better Man by Louise Penny\n\nIt’s Gamache’s first day back as head of the homicide department, a job he temporarily shares with his previous second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir. Flood waters are rising across the province. In the middle of the turmoil a father approaches Gamache, pleading for help in finding his daughter. As crisis piles upon crisis, Gamache tries to hold off the encroaching chaos, and realizes the search for Vivienne Godin should be abandoned. But with a daughter of his own, he finds himself developing a profound, and perhaps unwise, empathy for her distraught father.\n\nAnother great Gamache read! Once again, a Louise Penny book I couldn’t put down. With over 200 requests, I recommend you get on the list now or, if you’re feeling lucky, you can take your chances our Lucky Day copy will be on the shelf when you walk in. Up to you but this one is a don’t miss!\n\nTestaments by Margaret Atwood\n\nFrom Amazon: “This sequel picks up the story fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.”\n\n“Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.” —Margaret Atwood\n\nIn this chilling follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale, Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have left us hanging for decades. Well worth the read. (long listed for the Man Booker Prize)\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nThe Bear in the Attic by Patrick F. McManus\n\nIn this book McManus returns to many episodes of his childhood but now from the perspective of a grandparent. If you liked Rancid Crabtree, and the others in his first books or if you haven’t met them yet, you are in for a treat. This is a good one. Now I need to inventory my shelf to see which I don’t have, and get them…\n\nKim recommends:\n\nRa the Mighty: Cat Detective aka Cat Detective by Audrey Butler Greenfield\n\nCat Detective is the first in a brand-new series about the Pharaoh’s Cat in Ancient Egypt becoming a reluctant sleuth, with the help of his clever sidekick, a dung beetle. This is a quick, funny read for grades 3 to 6, and it would also work as a read-aloud for younger kids.\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nSocial Security Works by Nancy J Altman\n\nThis book is about why Social Security isn’t going broke and how expanding it would help us all. It was very informative.\n\nLife and Death of a Star (Astronomy Magazine’s Infinite Cosmos DVD Series) and\n\nRoving Mars (DVDs)\n\nAfter watching several science fiction shows, I decided to check out some real science programs. These two DVDs amazed me. To see the reality of what’s really happening in space and with our own space program was incredible. I liked Life and Death of a Star because it had stunning supernova explosions. In Roving Mars you experience the Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, first hand in an their awe-inspiring journeys to the red planet. Roving Mars made me feel like I was actually standing on the planet, Mars.\n\nGrateful Dead by Grateful Dead and\n\nBob Seeger and the Silver Bullet Band(CDs)\n\nI like these two bands and after playing them on the KNYO Radio Hour with Dennis Dias Fridays at 2 pm, I wanted to make sure everyone knows you don’t have to wait to hear these two classic bands on the radio—you can check them out at the library!\n\nValerie recommends:\n\nHis Majesty’s Dragon (Book 1 in the Temeraire Series) by Naomi Novik\n\nCaptain William Laurence is on a lengthy mission for the British Navy. Napoleon and his troops are gaining ground in the war, but after a brutal skirmish Laurence happens upon a treasure that may tip the scales in England’s favor. He procures a nearly-hatched dragon egg. However, before the mission can be completed Laurence is forced to make a decision that will affect the rest of his career and his life in the British Armed Forces. I enjoy this series because it shows a very loving relationship between a male character and his male companion. I find that many books can be lacking in representing loving male friendships.\n\nDreamer’s Pool (Book 1 in the Blackthorn & Grim Series) by Juliet Marillier\n\nBlackthorn is a healer who has been unjustly accused of starting a fire that killed her family. While imprisoned she reluctantly befriends the other prisoners, including one named Grim. Blackthorn is given the opportunity to escape her imprisonment, but it comes at a price—a price that she will pay for the next seven years of her life. As the story unfolds, the reader learns more about the magical world that Marillier has created. I enjoy this series because it uses magical elements to bring up topics of self-improvement and forgiveness.\n\nAugust 2019 Picks\n\nJohn recommends:\n\nYou’re Not Lost if You Can Still See the Truck by Bill Heavey\n\nI’m going to be objective here but it will be difficult. My goal in reading Bill Heavey, was to find a writer like Patrick F. McManus. Now I need to figure out which of McManus’ books I do not have and get them. Bill Heavey is not Pat McManus but he is interesting and, having read two of his earlier books, his writing has improved in this one.\n\nYou’re Not Lost if You Can Still See the Truck is a compilation of his magazine articles. One caveat, however, is if, like me, you are severely affected by stories of sudden infant death, you might want to skip the story: Suddenly She Was Gone. Also if you are offended by hunting and fishing you might want to skip the whole book or read only the sections on gathering.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nIn the Woods by Carrie Jones and Steven E. Wedel\n\nIn the Woods tells of the surprising relationship between Chrystal, the cynical daughter of a cryptozoologist who has a theory that Bigfoot is actually a vampire, and Logan, a sensible Oklahoma farm boy who witnessed a monster ripping off a calf’s head. The story successfully blends horror, action, humor, and, yes, teen romance, while also being a celebration of family, biological and found.\n\nValerie recommends:\n\nPractical Magic by Alice Hoffman\n\nSally and Gillian have known they were different since they were little girls. Due to unfortunate circumstances, they have to move in with their elderly aunts, who encourage them to be open to their weird family quirk: they are all witches and they are all cursed. I love this book because of the wise advice and the beautiful sayings that I now have in my repertoire.\n\nHitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\n\nArthur Dent is the most average guy, and the last person you’d ever expect to save the planet. Of course, he doesn’t save the planet. The earth explodes, but right before that, Arthur manages to tag along with a hitchhiker, thereby beginning a circuitous intergalactic journey. I enjoyed this book because the humor would still catch me by surprise halfway through the book.\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nThis Fight is our Fight by Senator Elizabeth Warren\n\nElizabeth Warren, one of the nation’s most influential progressives and longtime champion of working families and the middle class, is the senior senator from Massachusetts. A former Harvard Law School professor, she is the author of ten previous books, including A Fighting Chance, a national bestseller that received widespread critical acclaim.\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nThe Word is Murder by Anthony Horowitz\n\nOkay, I admit I wanted to read this based on the cover and I know you can’t judge a book blah, blah, blah. But this one panned out!\n\nI didn’t know when I started it, but The Word is Murder was written by well-known screenwriter, Anthony Horowitz, who created both the Midsomer Murders and Foyle’s War series. He also wrote the Magpie Murders, an attempt at walking in Agatha Christie’s shoe (my all-time favorite mystery author) and the Sherlockian Moriarty. The Word is Murder is unique among Tony’s work because in this novel he not only writes an intriguing mystery but he inserts a fictionalized version of himself into the story as the author who helps the irritable detective solve the crime (ala Castle, and who doesn’t love Castle?).\n\nHow can you pass on a book whose tagline is “She planned her own funeral but did she arrange her own murder?” I couldn’t. How about you?\n\nPS Horowitz is also the bestselling author of the Young Adult series, Alex Rider so this new series is not his first pony ride.\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nThe Prophecy of the Stones by Flavia Bujor\n\nThis book is a beautiful little fantasy written by Flavia when she was thirteen. The story has twists and turns, colorful characters, and I love the part where Death goes on strike.\n\nThree young girls are drawn together on their fourteenth birthdays, and must set out on a quest to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Each armed with a magical stone, they must work together and save the magical land called Fairytale. Meanwhile in modern day Paris, a girl named Joa dreams their story while fighting for her life in a hospital bed.\n\nJuly 2019 Picks\n\nJasmine recommends:\n\nA Dog’s Purpose by W. Bruce Cameron\n\nA dog lives life after life, always wondering—what is his true purpose? After his life as a stray mutt is cut short, he is surprised to find himself reborn as a golden retriever. In his new life, he finds his way to a boy named Ethan and the love they share shapes the rest of his lives as he is reborn yet again. This book is touching, funny, and amazing at describing everything from the dog’s perspective. It’s so, so good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves or has ever loved a dog.\n\nKaren recommends:\n\nLibrary at the Edge of the World by Felicity Hayes-McCoy\n\nWonderful story about a Librarian in a rural Irish town, who also drives the mobile library to the rural countryside, who rediscovers her place and herself as the village comes together to save the library. Charming read filled with interesting characters.\n\nRules by Cynthia Lord\n\nA must read for everyone. This is a great book for youth and adults to read about a tween girl who struggles with having an autistic brother and it takes another special needs tween to help her figure it out. Great story!!\n\nPeggy recommends:\n\nHow to Survive the Loss of a Love by Melba Colgrove, Peter McWilliams and Harold Bloomfield\n\nSomeone gave me this book when my father died nearly 40 years ago and I’ve given it to anyone close to me who has suffered a loss since. It’s a short, easy read but full of really good hints and helpful ideas on how to cope. Each page has ideas for getting through the daily challenges faced in grieving, be it a loss by death, the loss of a job, a break-up or whatever. It helps to know you’re not alone with these feelings and there is hope for the future.\n\nHarry Potter series (sound recordings) by J K Rowling; read by Jim Dale\n\nI can’t believe I haven’t recommended these audiobooks before especially since I listen to these books EVERY NIGHT. Jim Dale brings these characters to life like no other can. The magical world JK Rowling created just comes to life through his voice and, having seen the movies, I can picture each character as they progress through the series. Plus, I learn something new about the books and characters each time I listen. I drive my family nuts with this obsession because we can’t go anywhere or do anything without listening to the world of Harry Potter.\n\nGive these a try. I swear you’ll agree these are the best books to listen to. They will spoil you and you’ll be disappointed that Jim Dale isn’t reading all of your books.\n\nDennis recommends:\n\nDuke Ellington Reader edited by Mark Tucker\n\nDuke Ellington is universally recognized as one of the towering figures of 20th-century music, both a brilliant composer and one of the preeminent musicians in jazz history. The book includes over a hundred selections–interviews, critical essays, reviews, memoirs, and over a dozen writings by Ellington himself.\n\nDuke Ellington Greatest Hits (music cd)\n\nCheck out some of the music talked about in the book.\n\nKim recommends:\n\nTruly Devious by Maureen Johnson\n\nTruly Devious is a YA novel that is about things not being what they seem and is itself not what it appears on the surface. Yes, it’s a boarding-school-set mystery with a love interest and mild political satire, but there are in fact two mysteries, one contemporary and one still unsolved from the 1930s. The love interest is handled in a different way than I’m used to seeing in YA. Yes, there’s the bickering and miscommunication, but it comes from the characters (both what they seem and who they really are), and it’s never entirely clear if we should want the two to get together. The heroine is herself a sleuth who does questionable things and is in fact questioned on them, so she’s a mystery to be solved, too. The cliff-hanger ending (I’ve been waiting impatiently for weeks for the sequel to come in as a request) is perhaps the most truly devious part of the entire book, and yet it makes its own peculiar sense."
