        "text": "Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes each had birthdays this week. They do that synchronised thing a lot in the Presets, Australia's leading electronic group and most successful musical export not bearing guitars, hot pants or FM radio charms.\n\nSince they met as teenagers during their first year at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, Hamilton and Moyes have played together in the part-electronic band Prop and then the Presets, moved to within minutes of each other in the city's inner west, built matching studios in their homes and had children within months of each other in 2010.\n\nThey don't finish each other's sentences and neither do they look alike - Moyes has the rounder face and heavy eyebrows, Hamilton narrower features and deeper voice. But like a happily married couple, they come across as people who think alike, reinforce each other's arguments or memories and genuinely like each other. That's after more than a decade of touring and recording, three albums, seven ARIA awards (they were the first electronic outfit to win album of the year) and international sales approaching 1 million.\n\nIt is a closeness that goes back to their days at the conservatorium when, headphones on as they walked between classes, percussion major Moyes spied piano major Hamilton and identified him as a fellow traveller. Or, more accurately, a fellow explorer.\n\n''There weren't many cool people at the Con,'' says Moyes, who had also attended the Conservatorium High School. ''Classical musicians are a pretty weird, reclusive bunch and there weren't that many people that had good style. I thought Julian looked cool and we got to listening to music together and talking tapes.''\n\nHamilton introduced Moyes to Bjork on one of those walks, and Moyes introduced Hamilton to an album called Brit Hop and Amyl House, a 1996 compilation of big beat and electronic acts that featured artists such as the Chemical Brothers, Josh Wink, the Prodigy and Bomb the Bass.\n\nTo complete the picture of key influences noticeable in everything the pair have done since, they realised they were also listening to - and being blown away by - the techno programs on community station 2SER.\n\nWith that kind of listening schedule, you might wonder what they were doing at the conservatorium - not noted as a hothouse of electronica. But both were at the music school ''to hone skills and meet people'', as Hamilton puts it, in composition, jazz, formal and informal music. Neither had much interest in limits.\n\nAt the conservatorium, they investigated not only the traditional classical catalogue, but also the 20th century, diving into the avant-garde and experimental works of John Cage, Xenakis and Ligeti, and ''some of the crazy sounds [the composers] made''.\n\nIt was easy to see the links between the often discordant and rhythmically challenging material they were studying and the material they had banging in their headphones, whether it was finding how ''funky'' American serialist Steve Reich could be or how ''you could get down to'' Cage.\n\n''There was one track [by Dutch DJ Speedy J] that really sounded like it came from classical 20th-century music,'' Moyes recalls.\n\n''It wasn't a far cry from the really abstract, otherworldliness of techno and contemporary classical music.''\n\nIt's not until you are something that you can be yourself.\n\nThe connections shouldn't be surprising. After all, Jean Michel Jarre, whose pioneering work in the 1970s helped introduce electronic music to the mainstream, wrote recently that ''the root of electronic music is classical music''. The experiments in form and sound through the middle decades of the 20th century were applied most effectively at the edges of popular music.\n\nAnd, of course, somewhere in the mix for Moyes and Hamilton was pop, from the Pet Shop Boys to the Cure or the Smiths - music they were singing along to.\n\n''It's all just a big palette, isn't it?'' says Moyes, as Hamilton explains that a lot of their career has been about trying to make sense of all these things in the context of four-minute songs listeners can dance to. Never more so than on their third album, Pacifica.\n\n''There are moments in Adults Only [a new song from the album] when it's just noise, a wash - sort of like the wilder Xenakis music. There's that intensity,'' Hamilton says. ''I don't think we sit there and go, 'Let's make it like Ligeti'. It just sits in the brain. We also love [Pet Shop Boys'] West End Girls, classic pop songs and dance music in the '80s and '90s and we don't deliberately try to make something sound like the Pet Shop Boys either.''\n\nAt this point, it may be worth noting that the birthday they shared this week was their 36th. While Pacifica may only be the third Presets album, and a large proportion of their audience may be barely into their early 20s and likely to think Ligeti is a type of pasta, the band's genesis is far more complex and advanced than its recording experience and fan base suggests.\n\nPacifica is an album made by two men with a fair amount of life behind them, particularly since My People, the stomping single from their second album, Apocalypso, went double platinum locally and became their first radio hit overseas.\n\nNot to mention fatherhood, though Hamilton is reluctant to buy into that cliche. ''In some respects having a child, well, daddy's still got to go to work and do what daddy does,'' he says dismissively. ''If anything, having a child for me - and I'm sure for Kim as well - makes me want to be better at what I do. So while we don't go out and party to four in the morning in clubs any more, [it] doesn't mean we can't make music like that.''\n\nWe know now, from their conservatorium roots, that Pacifica’s antecedents are wider and deeper than the standard dance record. But in the more measured tempo of some songs, in the more overt strangeness of a track such as Ghosts alongside more clearly pop influenced melodies, and in the more considered, you might even say cultivated, singing from Hamilton, there are clear signs of a new, or extended version of Presets.\n\nIf, as Moyes argues, the difference between the first Presets album, Beams, and Apocalypso is the difference between people interested in pop music and people actually working to make pop music, then this time the difference is one of confidence and comfort.\n\n''With this record, the vocals have been the most effortless. I think back to some of the older stuff and it's like the bully in the Simpsons, ‘dude, that reeks of effort’, where now i just want to make it sound like me singing,'' Hamilton says. ''A touchstone for us in making this record, I guess, was whatever we do, let's make the music that feels really great and the music that feels most relaxed.''\n\nThat is only possible for experienced musicians who are comfortable with who they are and not desperate to prove themselves.\n\n''It's not until you are something that you can be yourself,'' Moyes says. ''That, to me, was an underpinning factor to this record, to go, 'Right, this is who we are'.''\n\nThey believe their audience is wide and wise enough to accommodate what Moyes calls their ''futuristic, forward-thinking combination of styles''.\n\nYes, he acknowledges, when you think about Presets fans, there is that element of people jumping around with their shirts off at festivals - ''which we adore'' - but that can't dictate their choices.\n\n''We want a career,'' he says. ''We are in this for life; we don't just want a smash hit single for the summer.''\n\nAnd anyway, says Moyes, there are plenty of other songs on the new record that will work fabulously in the festivals. The fact is they feel a responsibility to the people prepared to listen now who wouldn't have thought to do so before Apocalypso\n\n“That [album] was like, ‘we want your attention!’ and we got it,\" says Moyes. \"Now, okay, we back it up with what we think is awesome music and we show everyone that we can make really great songs, really interesting production and back it up with substance instead of just duplicating.”\n\nThe Pacifica songs will have their first live airing at the Parklife festivals later this month. Not every new song will be in the set, they concede, but it’s not going to be one banging track after another as some of their electronic dance colleagues like to do. ''Energy-wise, it needs to be like a big-time stadium DJ, but also … having the sort of musical flow of a band,'' Moyes says.\n\nIn putting together sets for the coming shows, they have been surprised by the synchronicity of some of their old and new songs. One old favourite, I Go Hard, I Go Home, is about the way Hamilton has always compartmentalised his life (not, as many assume, about living and partying to extremes). ''It's more like, 'Now I'm going hard … and now I'm going home','' he says, laughing. ''And that feels more real than ever.''\n\nAt the same time, the live show has sharply accentuated how things have changed for the pair. ''Singing those songs now, it's almost like an old man conjuring up some long-lost character,'' Hamilton says. ''Like watching your life flash before your eyes.'' And, to a certain extent, wondering about the future flashing before them."
