        "text": "THE DISSOCIATIVES - THE DISSOCIATIVES [2004]\n\nThe Dissociatives are an Australian band consisting of Daniel Johns of Silverchair, Australian dance producer DJ Paul Mac, and touring members Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes from Sydney electronic duo \"The Presets\". Their first single \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" was released in March 2004 and peaked at number 25.[1] The debut album The Dissociatives was released on 4 April 2004.\n\nThe Dissociatives is the sole album by the Australian duo of the same name, released in April 2004 by record label Eleven. It peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Three singles were issued from the album, \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" (March 2004), \"Young Man, Old Man (You Ain't Better Than the Rest)\" (May) and \"Horror with Eyeballs\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 they won Best Video for \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\", directed by James Hackett and Best Cover Art for the album, also by Hackett.\n\nThe Dissociatives has received a generally positive critical reception. A negative review came from Pitchfork, which wrote, \"Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working away from a club-oriented context, but it's Johns who seems out of his depth. Maybe he can write a three-chord rock song, but here he under-sings, over-emotes, and writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up nowhere\".[6]\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll music written by Daniel Johns and Paul Mac; all lyrics written by Johns.\n\n\"We're Much Preferred Customers\" – 5:46\n\n\"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" – 4:39\n\n\"Horror with Eyeballs\" – 4:45\n\n\"Lifting the Veil from the Braille\" – 4:18\n\n\"Forever and a Day\" – 4:49\n\n\"Thinking in Reverse\" – 3:41\n\n\"Paris Circa 2007slash08\" – 3:52\n\n\"Young Man, Old Man (You Ain't Better Than the Rest)\" – 4:31\n\n\"Aaängry Megaphone Man\" – 4:52\n\n\"Sleep Well Tonight\" – 2:29\n\n\"Paris Circa 2007slash08\" (Hermitude Remix) (Japan bonus track)\n\nThe team on the Rolling Stone cover. Talk about promotion. This must have been more anticipated than I knew about. It hit #12 in Australia.\n\nTHE DISSOCIATIVES\n\nIn 2004, Daniel Johns and Paul Mac formed The Disassociatives as an experimental outlet and this is easily Johns weirdest album yet. A bit like how Scott Weiland broke off from Stone Temple Pilots for the odd ’12-Bar Blues’ album, Johns is expected to get crazy and creative and he does put all his oddball curiosities into this. It’s a difficult listen for a Silverchair fan like me and though I’ve heard experimental music, this is pretty dense and I’ve had a tough time with it over the years. I’ve only heard it a handful of times but I don’t like it much.\n\n“We’re Much Preferred Customers”, is a good one to open with. It’s slow, sparse, electronic and meditative with warm harmonies and a great way to ease into the weirdness. “Get a chance another chance one more sun” sounds like Daniel wants a new beginning and another career like Silverchair. “Somewhere Down The Barrel” is pretty commercial so it served as the lead single. Someone reviewed this as “a happy Radiohead” and that’s pretty accurate.\n\nBut then we dive into some unchartered waters – some of the oddest alternative rock I’ve heard. “Horror With Eyeballs” is acid drenched symphonics with quirky lyrics. “Lifting The Veil From The Braille” somehow manages to be both breezy and heavy simultaneously. A lot of the material is more modern and incorporated the type of electro-pop that’s been big for some time now. “Thinking In Reverse” could be a hit in some odd fantasyland, it shares some of the same elements of many dance pop hits but it still remains off-kilter.\n\nIronically, it’s the track that follows “”Thinking In Reverse”, “Paris Circa ‘07/’08” marries 1960’s guitars and flute to a 2000’s techno rhythm.\n\nA lot of the album relies on textures, atmospheres, and vibes to get emotions across. It’s not an easy listen for any fan of the genres covered. It’s a mix of electronics, rock, psychedelia, dance and pop but it doesn’t fit anyone brand. If anything, this sounds like it’s trying to gain indie rock fans and cred. Johns sounds alright but he’s too preoccupied with sounds so the songs are buried a lot of the time. It’s a journey through the studio and what kind of experiments Paul Mac and Johns can discover but only a few times does a song pull off being both a solid composition and presentation. A lot of it is clouded and warbled. Listen to how “Young Man, Old Man” tries to start off as normal, a softer ballad with Johns singing sweetly over the typically lush synth orchestration. He’s in a pretty good mood here and the song’s chorus has one of the few hooks on the album. A difficult and dense album that takes a few listens to sink in. There are highlights but I had to work for them. Definitely more experimental but there are commercial moments and it continues a bit of where 'Diorama' left off. It's not as good though to me.\n\nJust wanted to talk about last Friday when I watched Silverchair on this from @meyers suggestion.\n\nSilverchair Live 1999 - Melbourne Park\n\nIt was just an awesome show - better than I expected. Everything sounded so glorious, it looked great and the playing and execution was spot on. The pacing and setlist were smooth and just everything was terrific with one issue I'll get to. \"Emotion Sickness\" was just fantastic as the opener and I thought it wouldn't be but it sounded better than I've ever heard it. What a break out of the gate. Then to follow with a second epic \"Israel's Son\" was a powerful way to begin. \"Anthem Of The Year 2000\" got some crazy jamming on the end of it and \"Satin Sheets\" in the middle of the set never sounded better either.\n\nThe one issue was Daniel and how stressed he looked. He performed as well as possible with just about no flaws but right on the first song, something was wrong. He was beginning to sing and after the first verse or around the first couple of minutes, he kind of jerked his head to the side like his jaw looked uncomfortable. It was just a sudden weird movement. Then as he's singing more, in between verses, he starts moving his jaw around kind of like Kurt Cobain used to do with the beat of the song. But Johns looked like something was wrong with his jaw and then I figured it out. He had something at the time I remember I had when I was a pre-teen. It was a nervous habit I used to where I'd kind of did this jaw movement like grinding my cheeks with my jaw muscles and I remembered they'd get like a bit of swelling. It occurred for maybe a year - I guess I was nervous about being in a new school and junior high so I got over it quick and I think Johns did too. It's just a shame he looks a bit odd because he keeps doing through most of the concert and it reminded me of me and he must have been in a dark place like a lot of his lyrics at the time suggested.\n\nSo I just wanted to mention seeing a great live performance -felt like being there some the audio and video was so good - thanks @meyers. If you guys get a chance give it a try.\n\n@WilliamWes glad you enjoyed it! And yes you noticed the jaw thing too hey? Johns keeps doing it throughout the performance; I was wondering what that was all about. Thanks for shedding light on it by relating it back to a personal experience of your own\n\nSILVERCHAIR - LIVE FROM FARAWAY STABLES\n\n[released November 10, 2003]\n\nLive from Faraway Stables is a 2003 live album and concert film by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair. It was recorded at their concert held on 19 April 2003, at Newcastle Civic Theatre in the band's home-town of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia,[5] and was the second show to be held there[6] during the band's Across the Night world tour of March to June 2003.[7] It is Silverchair's first live release.[8]\n\nOn all shows of the Across the Night tour, the concert was divided into two sets,[5] which were introduced on the three large video screens above the stage as \"Act 1\" and \"Act 2\"; the respective CDs and DVDs in the album are labelled in the same manner.[9] \"Act 1\", which showcased mainly quieter and more experimental material,[5] was \"dominated\" by songs from the band's then-latest studio album, Diorama, and was marked by \"grand orchestrated sections (replicated by two extra keyboards); dramatic flourishes, both vocally and instrumentally; [and] an almost parodic leap into prog rock's 'look at me, look at me' shifts of form and time.\"[10] \"Act 2\", which consisted of heavier rock songs,[5] saw the band \"revert to more of a hard rock set-up, with the cabaret touches junked for less subtle, but brutally effective delivery.\"[11]\n\nThe concert footage of songs listed on the audio CDs (Discs 1 and 2) appear on their corresponding DVDs (Discs 3 and 4). All songs were written by Daniel Johns, except for the \"Overture\" from \"Act 2\", which was written by Julian Hamilton.[2]\n\n\"Act 1\" – Disc 1 (audio CD)/Disc 3 (DVD)\n\n\"Overture\" – 1:32\n\n\"After All These Years\" – 4:33\n\n\"World Upon Your Shoulders\" – 5:14\n\n\"Tuna in the Brine\" – 5:27\n\n\"Luv Your Life\" – 4:44\n\n\"Paint Pastel Princess\" – 4:36\n\n\"Petrol & Chlorine\" – 5:07\n\n\"Across the Night\" – 5:25\n\n\"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\" – 4:33\n\n\"Miss You Love\" – 4:10\n\n\"Steam Will Rise\" – 9:26\n\n\"Act 2\" – Disc 2 (audio CD)/Disc 4 (DVD)\n\n\"Overture\" – 0:55\n\n\"Emotion Sickness\" – 9:30\n\n\"Without You\" – 4:11\n\n\"Israel's Son\" – 7:32\n\n\"Black Tangled Heart\" – 4:25\n\n\"Do You Feel the Same?\" – 4:32\n\n\"The Greatest View\" – 5:08\n\n\"The Door\" – 5:45\n\n\"Freak\" – 5:12\n\n\"Anthem for the Year 2000\" – 6:01\n\n\"One Way Mule\" – 6:21\n\n\"Asylum\" – 5:22\n\n\"The Lever\" – 13:43\n\nBonus material (DVD)[edit]\n\n\"Emotion Sickness\" (Live in Sao Paulo)\n\nAn Insight Into Production\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nSound Dolby Digital 5.1\n\nPersonnel\n\nDaniel Johns – guitar, piano, vocals\n\nChris Joannou – bass guitar\n\nBen Gillies – drums\n\nJulian Hamilton – keyboards, backing vocals\n\nStuart Hunter – keyboards, backing vocals\n\nNick Launay – mixing\n\nDavid Davis – assistant mix engineering\n\nChris Thompson – live recording engineering\n\nSteven Schram – live recording assistant engineering\n\nDon Bartley – mastering\n\nAndrew Lord – television director\n\nBen Richardson – executive producer\n\nThe album spent three weeks on the Australian ARIA Charts, peaking at #13.[12] It has been certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.[13] The original two-CD/two-DVD release was made available in both CD-sized and DVD-sized packaging.\n\nGonna watch this one tonight for this Friday night concert night I've been doing. I saw this is Tower so many times and at $50 it was too much - an import for the 2CD/2DVD. This will be my first time with it. Has anyone else seen this?\n\nHell yes, sir! It's superb\n\nWell I ended up writing a long review right after while I could remember everything so I can look at it for reference later. This is what I thought about the 'Faraway Stables' DVD.\n\nSILVERCHAIR -LIVE AT FARAWAY STABLES -live 2003\n\nSplit up into acts I and II, it’s a concert that goes through every song on Diorama and adds another hour and 20 minutes of a mix of early album tracks and a bunch of Neon Ballroom. The setlist is perfect for the fan that likes the softer, experimental, orchestral side of them. Daniel Johns is healthy and I guess recently married to Natalie and he’s even smiling on “Luv Your Life” early on. Gillies is just wearing some briefs behind the drum kit but he’s great throughout with plenty of energy even on the pop stuff. Chris Joannou seemed pretty bored on the Diorama material and Johns guitar got drowned out a lot of the time by the orchestral samples – no live orchestra – two extra keyboard/backing vocalists helped.\n\nJohns started alone on piano singing “After All These Years” with additional help from the samples. Then the band come out for “World Upon Your Shoulders”. Both are great performances – the crowd’s sitting at this point and this becomes a theme throughout. As the play more moderate pop/rock songs that rock a little, some stand but most stay seated. The audience gets enough time on camera so we see how it’s a mix of older people and younger and some stand some sit but the applause and reaction isn’t that enthusiastic. They get up more for “Across The Night”, “Ana’s Song” and “Miss You Love” played consecutively. By then, they’re into it for pretty much the rest of the way through. After a long “Steam Will Rise” with the only guitar rock of Act 1 mixed in with the calmer choruses. Johns does some guitar experimenting on it and throughout, you can tell he’s really gotten way better than in 1999 with way more tricks and ease of playing on everything. He’s fine on piano too.\n\nSo after about an hour of mostly ‘Diorama’ and softer stuff, I thought they’d rock for the rest of it but instead they do “Emotion Sickness” which at times has the strings drowning out the guitar but it’s still great just like in 1999 – they put extra charisma in this song both times. After “Without You” which has the fans excited, they do “Israel’s Son” which almost sounds completely out of place but I got into it. The crowd still had some sitting some standing so Johns goes to the mic and says stand up for this part – and then they do the fast coda and end it. Then he tells them they can sit if they want, they’re gonna play a soft one. I never heard a rock singer say ‘you can sit down’. It made it awkward as they played “Black Tangled Heart”.\n\nJohns says ‘we’re gonna rock and roll now you can stand up” which is so self-conscious, again I felt awkward watching, they do “The Door” - a particularly good performance where Johns does an American accent and the band play some R&B. “Freak” has Johns playful again singing a bunch of it in his newer falsetto instead of the deep growl. “Anthem Of The Year 2000” was the highlight with the crowd participating – he lets them sing the opening and throughout. Then they jump forward for “One Way Mule” leave the stage, and come back for “Asylum” – and great but oddly chosen encore -then again Johns has the crowd get up for 12 minute “The Lever”. He had said there would be surprises at the opening of the show and now he says ‘this is the surprise’ but there really was no surprise. After climbing and amp and tossing his guitar up in the air a few times Johns, Joannou and Gillies left without playing “Pure Massacre”, “Abuse Me”, “Cemetery”, and no signature song “Tomorrow”.\n\nWithout those major hits, I felt bad for a crowd that went through the entire ‘Diorama’ album, had to wait through intermission only to have to get up, sit down, get up, and then to not hear those hits. Anyone who was more into the debut was pretty screwed. “Israel’s Son” was the only song from ‘Frogstomp’. From ‘Freak Show’, only “Freak”, “The Door” and “Petrol and Chlorine” were there. So I felt unbalanced. I like both sides a lot and this was more a ‘Diorama’ tour where the fans seemed confused at times but overall I think they liked the show and I did too but I thought there would be surprises like Daniel said and I thought the stage and set up was nice but I thought more would happen. It could have been more theatrical – have some actors on there in the first act or some kind of acts doing dancing or magic, something extra to make it like a theatre show. So very good not excellent – Johns sang great, his guitar was excellent, Gillies was great, Joannou was mostly great. Overall, thumbs up.\n\nSILVERCHAIR -YOUNG MODERN\n\n[released March 30, 2007]\n\nYoung Modern is the fifth and final studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released on 30 March 2007. Young Modern entered the Australian albums chart at No. 1 on 15 April 2007, their fifth consecutive album to do this, making them the first band to accomplish this feat in Australia.

Any thoughts anybody?\n\nSILVERCHAIR-YOUNG MODERN (2007)\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to hear “Straight Lines” come out of nowhere with some DJ telling me it’s the new Silverchair. When the song came out, it actually got a lot of airplay here in the U.S. and of course Young Modern was #1, but so was this lead single. It was their first Australian #1 since “Freak” a decade earlier.\n\nThe mix of rock and dance on “Young Modern Station” sounds just like you thought the album might sound like if you had heard “Straight Lines” and decided to pick it up. Obviously, some of the dance sounds we heard Daniel Johns do with Paul Mac on Dissociatives is present here. Johns still has that strange pen that inks odd lyrics that try to straddle the line between real and fantasy:\n\nThe clocks are ticking timeless\n\nDead Dali days behind us\n\nThe band is back together\n\nAllergic and in the news\n\nWhat are you telling us Daniel? A lot of the lyrics have become indecipherable and it’s like Johns’ wall in between himself and the fans. The song goes on about other elements to having a band, making an album but it doesn’t come through strong enough. The music is modern for sure and after one track, we know, Silverchair have taken another turn – this time going from heavily orchestrated tunes to having dance pop tendencies and the mix of alt rock mentality and 21st century beats prove successful on a number of levels on the next track.\n\n“Breathing from a hole in my lung, I had no one” Johns sings beautifully over a lovely Coldplay-like landscape on the intro of “Straight Lines”, but those lyrics that open the song were all Silverchair. I didn’t realize it was Silverchair when I first heard it, I had to find out after the song played. It flew right by me. I did like it from the beginning. Pretty much the last time us U.S. fans heard them on radio with a new song. I never heard the other singles “If You Keep Losing Sleep” or “Reflections Of A Sound”. Considering how much I heard “Straight Lines”, I expected something else but no airplay. The former song didn’t even chart in Australia though the latter song hit #16.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason was it was definitely alternative to alternative rock which was still popular enough in 2007 to dominate alternative stations and webcasts. A few years later, and perhaps this material would have fit in better. At least here in the U.S. Young Modern won a ton of awards in Australia. It seems like an album that critics could eat up despite some hit or miss abstract lyrics from Johns, but its really that this is so much like a Daniel Johns solo album, Ben Gillies and Chris Joannou barely have a role. They’re even less noticeable than normal. Electro glam pop carries the album most of the way, with some good melodies and vocals. You can get lost in all of it during the middle of the album, with piano, strings and that prettier voice Johns has been employing. He really can sing well on the ballads.\n\n“If You Keep Losing Sleep” sounds closer to Broadway than to grunge and with all the orchestration, it foresees some of the style Panic At The Disco was playing around with later.\n\nJohns wanted it both ways – to have his bandmates but also his vision only and I think they went along alright with the new style of electronic/orchestrated pop, but luckily for Silverchair fans that like some guitar, the last few songs provide that. After their final single “Mind Reader”, a strong pop track that didn’t chart, “Low” finally brings back some rock and with a good melody and hook, it’s finally something meaty and more down to earth. A lot of the songs float heavily under fog and “Low” along with “Insomnia” do a good job of bringing some crispness to the affair’s air.\n\n“All Across The World” is a grower – the music really is catchy for something that’s not quite a riff nor a catchy chorus. Johns feeds right off of it for his vocal melody and it’s pretty memorable. I remembered this better than everything except “Straight Lines” when I put this on after years. It’s a good closer but it’s unfortunately the final Silverchair song of the catalog. A pretty good album that doesn’t match the raw power of the early records nor the artistic nature of the last 2 albums.\n\n(7/10)"
