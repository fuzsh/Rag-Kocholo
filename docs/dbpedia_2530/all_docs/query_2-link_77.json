        "text": "Having worked with Romance Was Born on two music videos for Architecture in Helsinki and Softlightes, Romance Was Born approached Moyes to make ‘something’ that featured their Autumn Winter 2010 range. Moyes’ response: a film, which in his words is “a short ridiculous story about a smart, hot, rich tyrant named Katherine Bowden who goes on a killing spree of sweet revenge once she hears that her egg headed financial adviser has drained all her savings. She’s a killer and she’s cooler than the other side of the pillow”.\n\nBowden is played by the Croatian model Tanja G. Romance Was Bornsuggested Tanya G for the role, having just worked with her on theirlatest print campaign and Moyes admits to having his initialreservations about casting her. But, after screen testing Tanya hedescribed her as “Incredible and perfect for the role. A strangecombination of the costumes and her character tonally pushed the filmin a completely different and unexpected direction”."
