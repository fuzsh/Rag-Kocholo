        "text": "The Presets took shape in 2003 when Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes first met at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. They were quickly recognised for their ability to fuse elements of dance music with an energy more akin to rock’n’roll. After signing with Modular Recordings, the band released two EPs and an album Beams (2005).\n\nIn 2008 The Presets released the chart topping Apocalypso, selling in excess of Triple Platinum sales in Australia and featuring four hit singles, including the classic ‘My People’. Setting new standards for dance music in Australia, The Presets went on to win 5 ARIA awards (and 2 ARIA Artisan Awards) including Album of the Year, as well as the J Award and FBI SMAC Award for Album of The Year. Kim and Julian also shared the coveted Songwriter of The Year Award at the 2009 APRA Awards.\n\nPacifica was released in 2012, featuring Rolling Stone Magazine’s Song Of The Year, ‘Ghosts’. Pacifica was also nominated for an ARIA, shortlisted for the AMP Award, the J Award, and was Album of the Year in the Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph, and Electronic Album of the Year in the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThe Presets have been recognised worldwide for their dynamic live performances, playing hundreds of shows domestically and internationally, including key slots at renowned international music festivals such as Glastonbury, Coachella, SXSW, Exit, Melt and Splendour In The Grass.\n\nThe Presets returned in 2018 with their long awaited fourth album, HI VIZ, which debuted at #1 on the iTunes album chart within hours of its release and was nominated for two ARIA Awards as well as the prestigious Australian Music Prize. The record spawned triple j Hottest 100 favourites “Do What You Want” and “Martini”, with the latter nominated for Best Song at the FBi SMAC Awards in 2019.\n\nThe band also released their expansive RAKA EP – a collaborative record with Golden Features, led by the euphoric single ‘Paradise’ in 2019. The track became triple j’s most played song shortly after its release and charted in the Hottest 100 of 2019.\n\nThe Presets kicked of 2022 with the club-primed single “You Belong” which featured in the soundtrack the band created for Sydney’s iconic midnight fireworks. The single became the most played song on Triple J for the month of its release.\n\nIn 2023 to celebrate 20 years of making beats together, The Presets announced 20 nights of DJ sets around Australia, playing small clubs and bars (July/Aug/Sep), reconnecting with the electric spirit that got them making music in the first place.\n\nIn addition to their work together Julian has guested with artists including Flight Facilities and Steve Angello as well as scoring pieces for the Sydney Dance Company. Kim is a prominent DJ, produced albums for artists like DMA’s, Northeast Party House and co-owns the buzzing EDM indie label Here To Hell."
