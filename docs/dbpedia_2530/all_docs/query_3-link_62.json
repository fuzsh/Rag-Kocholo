        "text": "This morning, The Presets made their grand debut on Like A Version. Yep, that's right.\n\nCan you believe it? Despite forming a crucial part of the Australian electronic music fabric, Kim Moyes and Julian Hamilton have never once performed on LAV.\n\n“We’ve been trying to avoid it for a long, long time but somehow we got roped into it,” Kim joked. “It took us 14 years to figure out what song to do.”\n\nFitting then, that for Ausmusic Month, the duo decided to tackle a stone-cold Aussie classic: Midnight Oil’s ‘Power And The Passion'.\n\nThey brought the brass of a full horn section and the bass skills of Touch Sensitive, while Julian channelled Peter Garrett's delivery to a tee and Kim worked up a sweat hammering the drumkit.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"[It's] a real touchstone for us,\" the pair said of their decision to cover The Oils' signature 1982 hit, which they described as \"where politics meets funky post-punk.\"\n\n\"15 or 16 years ago, when Kim and I started this band, we'd set up in his kitchen and we were trying to write songs,\" Julian explained. \"We would set up a synth and a drumkit and we were trying to cover this song to get ideas.\"\n\n\"We just loved their groove [and] would try and copy their energy, with synths. They’ve been a touchstone for us for our whole career.\"\n\nMakes sense. Especially given how the duo previously told triple j their 2017 comeback single 'Do What You Want' was a \"techno version of an Aussie pub rock song.\"\n\nHow dumbing down shaped The Presets' HI VIZ\n\nGetting back to their roots was a big part of The Presets' first album in six years, Hi Viz, a rave opus that mimicked the high-energy assault of their live show, \"or a mixtape you'd put on at a house party.\"\n\nWith contributions from Alison Wonderland, DMA'S (whose J Award nom'd second album was produced by Kim), and The Set BFFs DZ Deathrays, the record also functioned as a celebration of the current state of Australian music, which is \"very, very good. Healthy. Smashing. Lit,\" say the duo.\n\nThe pair also bridged the gap between the old and new for their Like A Version original: \"a bit of a mash-up\" between HI Viz track 'Feel Alone' and 'Girl and the Sea' - an old fan favourite and the title track to the band's 2004 EP.\n\nDespite not being a regular part of their set for about a decade, Julian said rehearsing 'Girl and the Sea' for LAV wasn't difficult. \"It's just a part of us, it's like rediscovering a mole.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nRELATED: 'The J Files: The Presets'\n\nLooking forward, the band have festival shows coming up, including Ice Cream Factory, NYE In The Park, The First NYD, For Shore, and Party In The Paddock. But really, the hardest part is over.\n\n\"We can relax now, we’ve done Like A Version!\"\n\nHere's some other takeaways from the duo's stint in the studio this morning."
