        "text": "A Facebook post by the Presets calling 26 January the “cruelest of anniversaries” has gone viral. The Sydney band have suggested other dates which Australia Day could be moved to, including the birthdays of writer Henry Lawson or Indigenous activist Eddie Mabo.\n\nThe band said 26 January marked the anniversary of the British settlement of Australia, a day “white man arrived with his guns, his alcohol, his church, his flus and other unknown illnesses”.\n\n“Out of all the days of the year that we could possibly choose to celebrate this wonderful nation of Australia, we think it’s frankly sickening that we continue to celebrate on this cruelest of anniversaries, January 26.”\n\nAt time of publish, the post had been liked 20,700 times and shared by more than 3,300 Facebook users.\n\nThe Aria award-winning electronic music duo, Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes, said they looked forward to a time when “a new day is chosen to celebrate our great nation – a day that we can all truly get behind”.\n\nThey said there were better dates to choose than the anniversary of Australia’s federation, 1 January – an alternative that has been widely suggested.\n\nThey proposed 16 August to honour the date in 1975 when then prime minister Gough Whitlam travelled to the Northern Territory and handed back land to the Gurindji people. “There he famously poured a handful of soil into the hands of Gurindji man Vincent Lingiari to symbolically mark the handing back of Wave Hill station to the Gurindji people.”\n\n“Just imagine if we could all get behind and celebrate a symbol as potent and as positive as that, in the same way that we, say, commemorate the memory of young soldiers storming the beaches of Turkey on Anzac Day.”\n\nHowever, not everyone was supportive of the post. Among the most liked comments was one by Candy Camilleri who said she was part Aboriginal and loved Australia Day. “It’s our country’s day to celebrate our country, that’s it. If we wanted to sit and stew about our ancestors past experiences we could pick any friggin day of the year. Each to their own, I have relatives that hate it.”\n\nAnother popular comment was posted by Nathan Sorensen-Salman. “How dare you insult a day that is about everyone and turn it into a political discussion which has a typical agenda pushed not by indigenous people, but by white do-Gooders.\n\n“Australia Day is totally about inclusion of everyone and is a celebration – not a commiseration.”"
