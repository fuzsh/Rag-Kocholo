        "text": "Ghanaian-Aussie sister duo Kinder are celebrating their culture with “Rasta”, a floor-filler that shares their father’s story.\n\n“Rasta is the story about our dad Kofi and his journey to Australia, where he literally walked across a desert in search of a brighter future. From Ghana to Libya, Europe and finally here,” explained Savannah Osei. “The making of this song was a long process for us. It started off very simply with a vocal chant Briony [Savannah’s sister] came up with walking on the street and recorded it as a voice memo in 2019. We came up with the basic melody, lyrics and started working with a few different producers first with Tasker and Mickey Kojak, then with Kim Moyes of The Presets, the song kept developing further and further, it was an amazing experience to keep pushing the beat along to where it is now”.\n\nThey thought they’d finished the track, but then they came across demos from local MC Gold Fang. They knew he could take the song to the next level, so Gold Fang recorded a freestyle verse during last year’s lockdowns. The sisters enthuse that “it was really the last missing piece of the puzzle”.\n\nIf you love what Kinder are laying down, make sure you catch them at one of the following shows:\n\n1 May 2022 – Big Gay Day, Brisbane\n\n12 June 2022 – Laundry Bar, Melbourne\n\n17 June 2022 – Civic Underground, Sydney\n\nImage used with permission from Warner Music Australia"
