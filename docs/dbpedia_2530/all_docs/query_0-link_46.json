        "text": "Written by Mike Frash //\n\nThe Presets with Antwon, Chela, Franki Chan, Marco De La Vega & Chauncey //\n\nThe Warfield – San Francisco\n\nThursday, November 13th 2014 //\n\nWin a pair of free tickets to one of our SF Shows of the Week by entering your name and email below. Contest ends Wednesday, November 12th at Noon.\n\nThe Presets last full length, Pacifica, was one of our top 10 albums of 2012, and lucky for us the captivating Aussie duo return to SF this Thursday at The Warfield.\n\nWe were there for their return to touring at The Independent, when they blew minds sub-headlining at Treasure Island Music Festival, along with their appearance last year at Fox Theater Oakland, so we can promise one thing: you will dance.\n\nAnd if you don’t find yourself dancing while taking in The Presets, perhaps it’s time to check yourself.\n\nThis couldn’t be more true than right now as The Presets wrap up the Check Yo Ponytail tour, where the party-starting electro-house outfit have joined forces with a dynamic group of dance and rap upstarts that includes Le1f, Antwon, Chela and Frankie Chan.\n\nThe Presets are busy at work on their fourth LP, but that didn’t stop Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes from releasing two excellent singles this year.\n\nFirst came “Goodbye Future”, a tech-house blaster that slightly signals a return to a song structure reminiscent of “This Boy’s in Love”.\n\n“No Fun” balances a wonky breakbeat with a four-on-the-floor chugger, until it blasts off into a refrain that crescendos into the euphoric stratosphere.\n\nThe Presets are one of our favorite dance acts that incorporate live instrumentation and singing, and you can win big by seeing them for free courtesy of Showbams. Enter your name below.\n\nBuy tickets if you know you want to go.\n\nRecommended Shows in SF this week:\n\n*We’ll be giving away free tickets to all shows marked in italics below.
