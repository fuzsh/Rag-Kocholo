        "text": "Less than 24 hours after landing in the U.S., Kim Moyes, half of the Aussie industrial, techno, new wave, dance punk, rock duo The Presets, kept his eyes and ears open long enough to chat about his band’s current U.S. tour. From his room at a Hollywood hotel, Moyes, who handles percussion and keys, gave a candid interview.\n\n“We are looking forward to this one, to be honest,” Moyes said of the tour. “Touring in the U.S. for three years, we’ve done a couple shows on our own. It’s good, but we seem to be jam-packed in the middle of other things, so you don’t enjoy it as much. And we’d get drunk, and by the end we’d feel 50 years old. You’d see us, and we looked like they did in that 'Benjamin Buttons'movie.”\n\nThe band enjoyed a mini break over the Christmas holiday (summertime in Australia), which gave them a short rest from that three-year tour. This time around, they headline (except for April’s Coachella Festival in California), and have created what Moyes said will add a new element to their live shows.\n\n“We’ve redone the whole set, and we’ve remixed songs so it sounds fresher,” he said. “It’s the last tour overseas before we take a break. It’s been a nice, fun little run. There was about a year between the first record and the last record. By the time you do stuff in the States, people in Australia are saying. ‘When’s the next one coming out?’ In Australia, it’s been phenomenal.”\n\nThe rest of the world has caught on as well. The band’s 2008 album, \"Apocalypso,\" has sold more than two million copies. The fourth single off the album, “If I Know You,” was released in late March of this year. The Presets get to unveil its new live look in early April (The Paradise in Boston, April 4; Metro in Chicago, April 8; Neumos in Seattle, April 14, and more). They land in Indio, Calif., April 17, for Coachella, an epic festival that this year features The Killers, Fleet Foxes, The Chemical Brothers, Morrissey, Franz Ferdinand, Paul McCartney and about 50 other bands during the three-day event.\n\n“We never really knew about it (Coachella) until a couple years ago,” Moyes said. “From its reputation and how great it is, we’re looking forward to it, because we’ve done pretty much every festival in the world except this one. Plus, backstage, there’s this Astroturf thing and these buggies – all fun stuff to do. And we’re playing on the first day, so we can check out other bands.”\n\nSpeaking of festivals, Moyes said he has mixed feelings. He and his Presets bandmate Julian Hamilton enjoy playing them, but don’t like getting lost in the shuffle of the, for lack of a better term, higher-profile bands.\n\n“We played T in the Park (Scotland), which is a great festival,” Moyes said. “It’s one of those festivals that has a great reputation in terms of lineup. We had a great time slot, closing this tent, but we were up against Prodigy, Rage Against the Machine, Primal Scream. Anybody would be pressed to miss out on that bunch instead of us, ‘that Aussie band.’ ”\n\nAt last year’s V-Fest, The Presets had quite a laugh during their set, particularly when the electricity from their fans overshadowed a quite cocky Billy Corgan.\n\n“We were playing against Smashing Pumpkins,” Moyes said. “We were playing ‘My People,’ while Billy Corgan was playing acoustic. He was dissing us. It was quite a laugh. He started putting stuff about us into his song. He complained to the promoters so he could play his little ballad. What a sad, bald baby.”\n\nRyan Wood is a freelance writer who has contributed to the Community Newspaper Company, Noize Makes Enemies, The Sun (London), The Sunday Sun (Northeast England), The Weekly Dig, and The Noise.
