        "text": "Almost Famous with K.I.M (The Presets) description\n\nBest known as half of iconic Australian duo The Presets, multiple ARIA Award winner Kim Moyes now showcases his many talents under the moniker K.I.M. In this guise, he has worked as a producer and co-writer with DMAâ€™s, DZ Deathrays, the Australian Chamber Orchestra and many others, as well as creating acclaimed remixes. He'll be heading to The Summerhouse for this very special reunion of Almost Famous.\n\nBorn in Adelaide in 2010, Almost Famous was one of the city's most iconic club nights known for bringing in the biggest EDM artists in the business. In addition to featuring outstanding international artists, such as Calvin Harris, Hardwell, Steve Aoki, Laidback Luke, Nicky Romero, Borgore, Deorro, GTA and many others, these club nights have launched the careers of local talent. Mega star Timmy Trumpet started his first Adelaide exclusive residency with Almost Famous, and then gave early opportunities to popular local DJs Uberjakd, Seek N Destroy, Bollocks Deejays, Paul Marshman and Dom P (Dimatik). They've also hosted their own stages at major national touring festivals, such as Future Music and Parklife.\n\nCome and relive the golden era of EDM with K.I.M and the Almost Famous residents playing nothing but back-to-back anthems all night - get into it!\n\nImage Ben Sullivan"
