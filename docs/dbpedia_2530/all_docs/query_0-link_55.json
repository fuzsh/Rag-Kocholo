        "text": "There is a strict limit of ten (10) tickets per customer for the presale and ten (10) tickets per customer for the General Public.\n\nPlease adhere to the published ticket limit. Persons who exceed the ticket limit may have any or all of their orders and tickets cancelled without notice by Ticketmaster at its discretion. This includes orders associated with the same name, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number or any other information.\n\nYes! Want a memento to remember your night? When selecting your tickets make sure you choose the Collector Ticket option to receive your Live at the Gardens souvenir.\n\nCollector Tickets will be dispatched approximately one month prior to the event.\n\nWe’ve updated our seating framework to include a larger range of accessible seating options. There will be an option for every price level and package available.\n\nAccessible tickets (including Companion Cards) can be purchased by calling our Customer Service team on the Accessible Bookings line Monday – Sunday 9am – 5pm AEST: 1300 446 925. This phone number is reserved for patrons with accessibility requirements and companion cardholders and cannot process any other ticketing requests.\n\nAccessible tickets, both during presales and the general public sale period, can also be requested via our Submit a request – Ticketmaster Help. Please be sure to include your relevant presale code with your request if wanting to make a booking during the presale period.\n\nWe expect that tickets to Live At The Gardens – The Presets will be in high demand, and to make the process fair for everyone you may be placed in a queue.\n\nYou will be assigned a random place in the queue once the onsale starts. Your place in the queue is not based on what time you entered the Waiting Room. We suggest entering the Waiting Room 15-30 minutes prior to the start of the Presale.\n\nOnce you get your spot in the queue, please do not refresh your browser as you will be pushed to the end of the line.\n\nWe will get you through the queue as quickly as possible, so please sit tight.\n\nGet in early and ensure all your MyTicketmaster account details are up to date – from your password to your card details and your phone number.\n\nTicketmaster will regularly ask you to update your password to ensure the security of your account – you don’t want to get stuck having to change your password while the ticket timer is counting down during onsale as you can risk losing the incredible tickets you have secured.\n\nInstead, now that you know you want to purchase tickets, log into your account and update your password today to ensure you are ready to nab those tickets.\n\n1. Open the Ticketmaster App\n\n2. Tap on my events and select the event you want to Ticket Transfer\n\n3. Tap ‘Transfer’ below the ticket you want to share (please note: you may have to wait a moment for the ‘Transfer’ button to load)\n\n4. On the ‘Select Tickets To Transfer’ page, confirm the ticket you want to share (please note – you must Transfer each ticket individually)\n\n5. Tap the ‘Transfer To’ button. Tap ‘Manually Enter A Recipient’ & enter your friend’s ‘First Name’, ‘Last Name’, and ‘Email Address or Mobile Number’\n\n6. Tap ‘Transfer Ticket’. The ticket in your account will now say “Sent”. You can cancel or recall the Ticket Transfer at any time.\n\n7. Your friend receives an email, asking them to accept the transferred tickets, and they can either login or create a new Ticketmaster account to accept.\n\n8. The tickets are now ready to go in your friend’s Ticketmaster account and marked as ‘Transferred’ in your account\n\nFind out more about Ticket Transfer – including how to accept and open a transferred ticket here."
