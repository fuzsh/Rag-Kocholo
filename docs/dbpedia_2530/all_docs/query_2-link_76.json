        "text": "Missy Higgins\n\nCountry of origin:\n\nAustralia\n\nType of music generally:\n\nAlternative pop/rock\n\nStatus:\n\nMost recent release, The Special Ones (2018)\n\nSee also:\n\nMissy Higgins' site\n\nWikpedia's entry on Missy Higgins\n\nComparisons:\n\nMargot O'Breslin\n\nCovers/own material:\n\nOwn\n\nGeneral comments:\n\nSee album comments below\n\nComments about live performance\n\nWe went to see the Waifs last week. Opening for them on this Australian tour is a young Melbourne singer/songwriter called Missy Higgins, who I think will be someone to watch out for. She played mostly the piano but also went to the guitar for one or two songs. She's got a great voice and great songs. (10/03, Sherlyn.Koo)\n\nShe did a showcase at the Hotel Cafe in November. I had doubts after hearing her demo a few years ago that she really was the 'complete package' so many A&R were touting. Well, I was wrong, this girl definitely has me convinced. Huge voice that effortlessly delves in and out of jazz phrasing seamlessly with a pleasantly melodic touch... Surprisingly good, relaxed feel for the stage with an aggressive posture at her piano... Her short set list included \"All For Believing,\" \"Don't Ever,\" \"Simple Things,\" \"The Special Two,\" \"The Cactus Found the Beat,\" and \"Greed For Your Love.\" She mentioned she wrote 'Cactus' at some ridiculously young age. This song was the head-turner point in her set. People (consisting of pretty much the entire Warner Bros. Records staff) stopped talking... 'Special' and 'Greed' seem destined for CHR greatness. (2/04, thecritics@earthlink.net)\n\nMissy Higgins played a solid but too-short set of about 35 minutes or so. The crowd size had increased since the end of Jorane's set, and with a generous smattering of Australians about, there was a good buzz in the room. Missy opened on keyboards by herself, and was soon joined by an acoustic guitarist whose name I didn't catch, but he played with her on several songs. Coming across like a seasoned entertainer despite her young age, Missy looked very comfortable on stage, and injected some amusing banter between songs. Either she's a perfectionist when it comes to sound, or she had some genuine monitor issues as she kept asking her sound man to adjust the mix during the breaks, but none of it seemed to affect her performance. Her vocals and playing were spot-on except for one point where she forgot a lyric, which she managed to turn into a comedy break before taking it again from the top. Good songs, good sound, I liked her set a lot. (6/05, carnivore@bigfoot.com)\n\nAlso on the bill that night [with Kyler at the Hotel Café] was Missy Higgins who is in town working on a new album with Mitchell Froom. Ben Lee joined her on stage for a cover of James' \"Laid\", and there were many Aussies in the house cheering them on. Missy's cute as a button with a lovely voice and a knack for beautiful tunes. Reallly loved her piano-driven ones.

This girl has really got a whole heap of talent and I predict that she's going to be known worldwide within a year or two. I've been listening to the EP on repeat for about a week now and my only complaint is—only four songs! Must. Have. More! (Sherlyn.Koo)\n\nWhen her name was first mentioned here on ecto I downloaded the sample of \"All for Believing\" and have listened to it often since—I find it really catchy. So the instant I heard the ep was available I ordered it and it arrived a few days ago.\n\nAlas, \"All for Believing\" is the only track I like on it. At all. I still find \"All for Believing\" incredibly catchy, but the rest of the tracks do less than nothing for me. As a matter of fact, I can't bear to listen to them. I'm not sure what it is—because the music and lyrics are just too painfully predictable to me? And she sings so powerfully and earnestly?\n\nAnyway, I'm sure someone else here will love this, though. She's got quite the vocal style. And I still love \"All for Believing\"—it's a hit repeat song for me, which is why I'm so disappointed.\n\nShe reminds me very much of Margot O'Breslin (whom I consistently like) here.

(JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nOne of the best albums of the year.

Now she seems to have finally delivered on her promise with this collection of well-crafted piano-based pop and folk-pop songs. (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nThe EPs Collectible\n\nRelease info:\n\n2010\n\nAvailability:\n\nWide\n\nEcto priority:\n\nRecommended for fans of Missy Higgins\n\nComments:\n\nAs the name suggests, this album collects several EPs in one place along with some tracks recorded for compilations. So there's a lot of material—32 songs and 34 tracks in all. It's best digested in pieces and fans are likely to find a few hidden gems.

Missy's sound is more fleshed out and there are some interesting textures in the instrumentation (check out \"Unashamed Desire\"). The most interesting song is the bluesy \"Watering Hole\". (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nFurther info:\n\nMissy Higgins' DVD If You Tell Me Yours I'll Tell You Mine was released in Australia in 2005.
