        "text": "Julian Hamilton, one half of Aussie electronic figureheads The Presets, has dropped his very first solo track. It's called 'City of Love', and y'all are vibing!\n\nFacing some extra downtime due to COVID, Julian decided to kick off a side project to focus on his own writing. A little simpler and more club-centric than The Presets, 'City of Love' is the first taste of a wave of solo material Julian's got prepped.\n\nPlus, The Presets are still \"busily working away on some surprises for later in the year,\" as the frontman wrote on the band's Instagram last week. Listen to his solo debut below.\n\nWhat did you think of it?\n\nHere's what the triple j textline had to say about 'City of Love' when it got its premiere on Good Nights:\n\n☏ Yes yes yes. I can hear the banging club remixes now!! Has the magic touch. Cheers. Stuart.\n\n☏ If Robyn and the Chemical Brothers had a love child.. this would be it... love it! Steve, melbourne\n\n☏ Oh yes, where's the smoke machine! Two stepping in my lounge room.\n\n☏ Wow! His still got it. Mesmerizing...Love Jen and Geoff from Eggs and Bacon Bay\n\n☏ Longest time fan of presets. So happy to hear more from Julian! Love this so much!! Chelsea, Meanjin/Brisbane\n\n☏ Holy shiiiiiit. Classic Presets energy. I've been waiting for this all week and am loving it. - Mitch, Newie.\n\nOutside of fronting The Presets, Julian Hamilton has been a huge influence on the Australian music landscape, having co-written and contributed to music from Flume, Flight Facilities, Dillon Francis, KLP, Cut Copy, Dan Sultan and more.\n\nHis partner, Kim Moyes, is no slouch either. In recent years his production credits have been found in music for DMA'S, DZ Deathrays, Keli Holiday (Adam from Peking Duk's solo project) , and most recently on Holy Holy's new album Hello My Beautiful World.\n\nEverything is terrible! But Holy Holy reminded me, maybe it's still a beautiful world"
