        "text": "The two fondly recall hearing Daft Punk's Da Funk for the first time together and \"freaking out\". It was a seminal night for the Presets' sound.\n\n\"There were people playing acid music and a guy in the corner selling trips on Wednesday nights,\" says Hamilton.\n\n\"The Chemical Brothers (on their Exit Planet Dust album) mixing rock and techno was hugely influential. They were trying to sell a rock band without instruments. Then it was Daft Punk, Aphex Twin and the whole Warped records thing.\"\n\nNow, as the Presets, the duo are infusing some colour into the often bland and monotonous realms of commercial radio and mainstream pop and are the hottest act in Australia. The band's second album Apocalypso debuted at number one two months ago and has not left the ARIA Top 10 since. Their latest theatre tour sold out in minutes.\n\nThe Presets are leading a changing of the electronic musical guard. Inspired as much by Daft Punk and 1990s techno as Depeche Mode, the thriving scene is often described as \"nu electro\". It's a clumsy term for a deliberately clumsy type of music: loud, hypnotic, rock-styled electronica brimming with pop hooks.\n\nFor once, Australia is considered a pioneering force amid the overseas acts reinvigorating electronic music including Justice, Digitalism, Chromeo and Maps.\n\nThe Australian bands synonymous with this type of pop - the Presets, Cut Copy and Midnight Juggernauts - are lauded worldwide for their ingenuity and unflagging work ethics.\n\nHamilton says the new crop of like-minded Australian and overseas electronic-based acts share an ethos typified by a lack of ego. They regularly remix each other's songs and write and tour together.\n\n\"Everybody feels like they're in the same boat,\" Hamilton says. \"They know there's something going on that goes against the grain.\"\n\n\"It may be a cliche,\" says Moyes, \"but it feels like something organic is happening in Australia. There's a sense this will probably never happen again.\"\n\nThanks to MySpace and a cluster of blogs, the geographical isolation that has dogged Australian rock acts is less relevant to electronic outfits. Cut Copy, for example, have just returned from a US trip in which 20 of 22 dates sold out. The Presets last week sold out New York's Bowery Ballroom.\n\n\"For a change, people overseas are recognising the Australian scene,\" Cut Copy frontman Dan Whitford says. \"People can access our music anywhere in the world. Through overseas blogs, people are hearing tracks from Australia as soon as they come out here. And there's probably as big an electronic scene now in Australia as anywhere else in the world.\"\n\nOne factor distinguishes the Australian electronic scene - live shows. Although they do not perform \"live\" in the traditional sense (up to 40% of a Presets gig is pre-recorded), the Australian acts are all veterans of the road with well-honed live shows.\n\nThey are dance acts shaped by the Australian pub-rock band work ethic of yesteryear.\n\n\"We spent a lot of time touring with the Presets early on,\" Whitford says. \"Especially in the early days when there was a tiny scene for this music. We all struggled on tours playing shows to rooms that were not even half full. The overseas acts are more studio-based.\"\n\nThe Presets' pop slant can be accounted for by a love of 1990s commercial techno - think Guru Josh, Utah Saints, Hocus Pocus and Eiffel 65.\n\nMoyes played in a high-school band specialising in Sex Pistol and Cure covers. In year 10, he adored Nirvana's Nevermind and trance songs such as Usura's Open Your Mind.\n\nAt the same time, on the other side of Sydney, Hamilton was becoming obsessed with electronic dance music.\n\n\"It was always around me,\" he says. \"Everybody around me loved the Chili Peppers. I didn't get it.\"\n\nIt was in Prop, an arty group of conservatorium musicians, that Hamilton and Moyes began playing together.\n\nProp was a collective of classically trained musicians inspired by American post-rock outfit Tortoise. Hamilton was on piano, Moyes on vibraphone. It was, essentially, a chance for the students to play pop on classical instruments.\n\n\"It was weird; a little prog-rock, a little trance, very hi-fi, and even jazz,\" Moyes says. \"It was a really odd mix, but it was really, really beautiful.\"\n\nAfter each Prop rehearsal, Hamilton would get on his synth and Moyes on his drums, and they'd play \"the dumbest, stupidest, most basic thing we could\". This was the beginning of the Presets.\n\nAfter finishing their studies, they realised they wanted to play pop. Stepping away from Prop, they released a couple of Presets EPs in 2003 and began working with Daniel Johns' outfit the Dissociatives. They toured nationally, playing both as support act and as Johns' rhythm section.\n\nTheir debut album Beams soon took shape. By day, they played and rehearsed with Johns. By night, they wrote songs. At the same time, they were teaching music and working as session musos: Moyes played with Paul Mac, Hamilton with Silverchair and Pnau.\n\nAfter a world tour with Johns, they knuckled down and produced Beams. The album did not chart but slowly became better known through word of mouth and incessant touring, selling fewer than 30,000 copies.\n\n\"Did people like it? I don't even know,\" Hamilton says. \"It was weird. We were away for a lot of it.\"\n\nThe album did, however, score some victories for the band. It was used prominently in the US on TV series such as CSI, The O.C. and So You Think You Can Dance.\n\nThey continued writing and playing with various bands. Hamilton was string arranger for the Sleepy Jackson. Moyes wrote with Digitalism.\n\nHamilton began writing with Johns sporadically following the Dissociatives' European tour. From those sessions, came the best Australian pop song of last year, Straight Lines.\n\n\"Writing that song was important to me,\" Hamilton says. \"Daniel tackles things with no fear. He has grand ideas lacking the weight of discipline that we have as trained classical musicians. He doesn't think of the barriers.\"\n\nWhen contacted by EG, Johns returns the compliment: \"Jules is a brilliant arranger,\" he says.\n\nThe two began work on Apocalypso by jamming on a farm for two weeks. They had the bassline for comeback single My People and took six months to finish the track. Next came second single This Boy's In Love.\n\n\"We knew once we nailed those songs, they would be huge,\" Moyles says. \"My People set the parameters for the album.\"\n\nLike much of the record, there is a dark undercurrent to the track, with lyrics about Australia's immigration detention centres. While clearly leaning on 1980s pop - think Depeche Mode - it has a thoroughly modern sound.\n\nStill, he remains circumspect about his career's longevity.\n\nCut Copy's Whitford says Hamilton and Moyes have succeeded because of an emphatic belief in what they are doing.\n\n\"When they started, I didn't expect them to take off,\" he says. \"In music, it comes down to self-belief. If you have that, you can transcend your start. Maybe the same goes for us. We never dreamed there would be such a big electronic scene in Australia.\"\n\nThe Presets play the Forum Theatre, June 21-22."
