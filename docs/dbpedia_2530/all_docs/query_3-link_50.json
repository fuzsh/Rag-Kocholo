        "text": "The Presets are coming to grips with their own mortality.\n\nAt the ripe old age of 36, Kim Moyes and Julian Hamilton have distanced themselves from their trademark random ''wacky'' dance songs and have settled on more existential narratives via lyrics in their third album, Pacifica.\n\nGone are the carefree dance anthems from Beams and Apocalypso, replaced by softer, gradually building tracks that progress from sea shanties (Ghosts) to narratives about ''little old ladies'' with open piano chords (Adults Only).\n\nLyrical narrative writing is a ''side effect'' of age, Moyes admits on the phone.\n\n''Julian wanted to write songs that actually mean something to him. You want everything to mean something because time gets precious,'' he adds, sounding melancholic.\n\n''We wanted the music [to be] not necessarily just strictly dance music but not strictly indie or pop music.''\n\nThe duo, who formed the Presets in 2003, instead aimed for a ''hybrid'' album that was ''not so harsh but something mellow and that you can put on at any time of the day''. ''It's a bit more of a story and more of a journey,'' Moyes says, before correcting himself. ''I hate when people describe their music as a journey.''\n\nThe Presets' own journey started when Moyes and Hamilton met at Sydney's hub for classically trained musicians - the Conservatorium of Music.\n\n''I was always pretty terrible at reading music; I do everything from memory,'' Moyes says, when asked how he made the notoriously difficult transition from strict classical-style music to dance music.\n\nBut Moyes was always ''surprised'' when his other classically trained friends couldn't improvise. He and Hamilton were more into ''musical conversations'' with instruments than words.\n\nNot that they would ever regret their revered music education. ''Most of the people who are doing really well in music have a really decent music education,'' he says of the festival scene. ''It's hard and you need to really have solid foundations to move through different styles.''\n\nIt's almost ironic that the Presets have released only three albums, considering Moyes says he has no other hobbies: ''I'm pretty boring and one-dimensional like that.''\n\nThere is a meditative quality to playing music.\n\nKim Moyes, The Presets\n\nBut music gives him all he needs to feel satisfied. ''There is a really meditative quality to playing music and it's actually really therapeutic. It's a nice way to kill time.''\n\nNow both fathers, Moyes and Hamilton agree they have had an ''amazing musical career''.\n\n''I'm constantly learning new stuff and I work seven days a week,'' Moyes says.\n\nWhen the Presets play at Parklife today they hope their new album will connect with a range of ages, thanks to the slower tempo. You also get the sense that it's quality, not quantity, that matters to them. ''If it's super successful maybe we won't have to put one out in another year,'' Moyes says.\n\nThe Presets play at the Parklife Festival in Centennial Park today. Pacifica is out now."
