        "text": "Australian musician\n\nKimberley Isaac Moyes is an Australian musician, producer, mix engineer, composer, songwriter, DJ and one half of the Sydney-based electronica duo, The Presets.[1] Moyes provides synthesizers and drums, as well as engineering, production and songwriting. The Presets have released two EPs and four full-length albums (Beams, Apocalypso, Pacifica and Hi Viz). Moyes also records and performs as a solo artist under the aliases K.I.M. In 2018, Moyes launched his own vinyl and digital record label called \"Here To Hell\".\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn on 15 September 1976 in Sydney, New South Wales, Moyes attended the Conservatorium High School for his final school years 11 and 12, before going on to a Bachelor of Music at the Sydney Conservatorium Of Music (majoring in classical percussion).[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Presets\n\nDuring his studies at university Moyes formed the instrumental band \"Prop\". They released one full-length album, a remix compilation and limited edition Japanese only 7\". Prop enjoyed a cult following and toured as main support for 90's heavyweight bands such as Sonic Youth, Stereolab and Tortoise. They were invited to curate a performance at the Sydney Opera House entitled \"Prop & Friends\". [2]\n\nAs a member of The Presets Moyes has enjoyed considerable success: 12 ARIA Nominations (of which they have won 7),[3][4] APRA's Songwriters of The Year 2012, as well as many other awards for Best Live Band, Band of The Year and Album of the Year.[5]\n\nOutside of The Presets, Moyes has released many recordings of his own. Through Cutters records he released \"System Breakdown\" in 2005, followed by the 12-inch single \"B.T.T.T.T.R.Y\" through Bang Gang in 2006.[6] In 2007 and 2008 he released a consecutive series of 12-inch records through Modular Recordings: \"Wet'N'Wild\", \"Party Machini\" and \"Fistogram\". Many of these tracks were to be featured on Selected Jerks 2001–2009, a double-disc album of original recordings and remixes throughout 8 years.[7] Selected Jerks was preceded by a Japanese only mini-album, System Breakdown, released in 2006 via Rallye Records.[8]\n\nThroughout his time as The Presets, Moyes has remixed many artists, both as The Presets and under his K.I.M. or (KIM) moniker, including acts such as Kings of Leon, Sarah Blasko and Architecture in Helsinki.[9][10][11] He has also worked extensively as a session musician and as a producer. His production credits include albums for Kirin J Callinan, Jack Ladder, Beni and DMA's.[12][13][14]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nMelbourne WebFest\n\n[edit]\n\n2022 Best Original Score - Phenomena\n\nAPRA Award\n\n[edit]\n\n2009 Songwriters of the Year (shared with Julian Hamilton)[15]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nLive Albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of albums Title Details Live In The Tank\n\nReleased: 28 Nov 2023 (AUS)[16]\n\nLabel: Here to Hell (HTHLP004)\n\nFormat: DD\n\nScore Albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of albums Title Details Phenomena\n\nReleased: 12 May 2021 (AUS)[17]\n\nLabel: Here to Hell (HTHLP003)\n\nFormat: DD\n\nCompilation Albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of compilation albums Title Details Selected Jerks 2001–2009\n\nReleased: 30 October 2009 (AUS)[18]\n\nLabel: Modular (MODCD117)\n\nFormat: CD, DD\n\nMini Albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of mini-albums Title Details System Breakdown\n\nReleased: 14 October 2006 (Japan only)[19]\n\nLabel: Rallye / Klee (KLCD007)\n\nFormat: CD\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of extended plays Title Details Kloser\n\nReleased: 8 August 2014 (AUS)[20]\n\nLabel: Motorik!
