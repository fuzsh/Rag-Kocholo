        "text": "JUST ANNOUNCED! Angus McDonald wins the 2024 Archibald Prize ANZ People‚Äôs Choice award for his portrait of Aboriginal writer and academic Marcia Langton AO. McDonald is an artist, documentary filmmaker and strong advocate for human rights and social justice. A seven-time Archibald Prize finalist, he was also the winner of the 2020 ANZ People‚Äôs Choice award for his portrait of Behrouz Boochani. McDonald said he was overjoyed and emotional to receive the news of the win. ‚ÄòI am so thrilled that the public voted my work as their favourite,' he said. 'It‚Äôs a privilege to be able to share Marcia‚Äôs inspirational story with a wider audience through this painting. Receiving the award is a special honour to me, but equally, it's as much a strong vote of respect and admiration for Marcia Langton and acknowledges the profound part she has played in the struggle for Indigenous recognition and reconciliation in this country for over 50 years.' Professor Langton is a leading academic, writer and activist, and is a descendant of the Yiman and Bidjara nations of Queensland. A trailblazer in the Aboriginal rights movement in Australia, Langton has dedicated her life to the advancement of Indigenous recognition and social justice. ‚ÄòI placed her just right of centre to suggest a sense of stepping away and handing the baton to a younger group of activists after a lifetime of tireless commitment,' McDonald explained. 'She gazes up and to the left to reflect that she has persistently followed her own path. I'm grateful to Marcia for agreeing to sit for me, this time spent together was the highlight of the whole process.‚Äô __ You can see McDonald's portrait on display in the Archibald, Wynne & Sulman Prizes 2024 exhibition until 8 September.

This opportunity is open to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and aims to nurture early-career individuals, with applications being sought for two fixed-term positions. At the Art Gallery of NSW, we are seeking to engage an Assistant Curator in First Nations art (local and global), while the UQ Art Museum will appoint an Education Producer across their collaborative Education team. The #OceansPathway project is designed to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration between both the Assistant Curator and the Education Producer, through a dedicated residency and exchange at the alternate art museum.

A four-time #ArchibaldPrize finalist based in Kurrajong in greater western Sydney, Laura Jones credits her childhood spent in nature as a driver of her practice and her passion for environmental advocacy. Working across painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture, her compositions explore the complex relationships between humanity and nature. Jones said her heart was racing when Art Gallery director Michael Brand phoned this morning to deliver the news. 'There is an array of brilliant finalists for the 2024 Archibald Prize,' Jones said. 'I am shocked and humbled to be chosen as the winner. This is a life-changing moment for me. I would like to thank my sitter, Tim Winton. Tim is one of the world‚Äôs greatest novelists and also a tireless advocate for the environment. He is an inspiration to me as both an artist and as a human being.' An acclaimed Australian novelist, Winton has authored 30 books including the Miles Franklin Award-winning novels 'Cloudstreet' and 'Breath'. Based in Perth, he has dedicated much of the last two decades to campaigning to protect Western Australia‚Äôs Ningaloo Reef. In 2023, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished services to both literature and environmental advocacy.

The work is one of the largest bark paintings ever produced and the first bark painting to be awarded the Wynne Prize. The painting depicts the miwatj, or ‚Äòsunrise side‚Äô in Yol≈ãu Matha. It relates to the north-easternmost part of Arnhem Land, NT, that receives the first light as the sun rises in the east. This is the landscape during April and the start of Mi·∏èawarr (the harvest season following the wet), when the earth receives sudden surprise showers during what is meant to be the dry. A first-time #WynnePrize finalist, Yunupi≈ãu paints on bark using earth pigments and gapan (clay). She paints lore connected to the beach at Garriri/Rocky Bay, through songs gifted to her by her father, renowned artist Mu≈ãgurrawuy Yunupi≈ãu. It refers to the tale of the Djulpan, a group of Yirritja spirit women who are a constellation ‚Äì the Pleiades. These are the seven sisters, who come together to gather food. They then retreat over the northern horizon to their homes. If fires are lit before these celestial movements take place, the Djulpan become sad and cry, as is evident in this painting. Working from the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in Yirrkala, NT, Yunupi≈ãu first exhibited her paintings in 2021 at the age of 72, after caring for her late sister Mrs N Yunupi≈ãu, who won the 2021 Wynne Prize.

A first-time #SulmanPrize finalist, Kantjuriny is a respected A·πâangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) community Elder who mainly works across painting and drawing, but is also a basket-maker and wood carver. She is a ngangkari or traditional healer who specialises in women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs health and provides treatments for the mind, body and spirit. Upon hearing the news of her win, Kantjuriny said: ‚ÄòI am so happy to win the Sulman Prize. I am an artist and a ngangkari. I started working at my art centre, Tjala Arts, many years ago alongside senior women. We grew it for the young ones, and the generations to come, and now they have found their way and love painting too. I‚Äôve been painting for 30 years, and I love it. I love what my art centre is and the support it provides for my community. ‚ÄòThe story of the mamu is a story we sing and dance to. Mamu are good and bad spirits, sometimes they hold scary stories that teach lessons to the grandkids, sometimes they are funny and joyful stories that make us all laugh. Mamu also protect us from illness and danger. Our culture is in everything we do, and I hope culture will be celebrated at Tjala Arts forever, but today is a happy day,‚Äô said Kantjuriny. This year‚Äôs Sulman Prize was judged by Sydney artist Tom Polo, who selected Kantjuriny‚Äôs work from a field of 40 finalists. ‚ÄòNaomi Kantjuriny‚Äôs \"Minyma mamu tjuta\" reached out to me repeatedly during the judging process,' said Polo. 'The dynamism within her composition and bold use of black and white to depict mamu made this work one of conviction, and a joy to return to.‚Äô See Kantjuriny‚Äôs striking painting with all the winners and finalists in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes 2024 exhibition, opening Saturday 8 June: https://bit.ly/4abWlWT Proudly supported by Presenting partner ANZ and Major partners Herbert Smith Freehills and Oroton. __ Image: Winner Sulman Prize 2024, Naomi Kantjuriny ‚ÄòMinyma mamu tjuta‚Äô, synthetic polymer paint on linen, ¬© the artist #NaomiKantjuriny\n\nHost your clients at exclusive events in the inspiring surrounds of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the state's flagship art museum.
