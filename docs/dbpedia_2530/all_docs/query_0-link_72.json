Established on the traditional lands of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and Bunurong peoples, it continues to be a place of gathering, a green oasis in the heart of Melbourne and one of the world’s most beautiful botanic gardens. A leader in plant conservation, scientific research and cultural adventures, it celebrates and protects biodiversity while being a unique and beautiful space to connect with nature.\n\nRenowned for curating unforgettable, world-class outdoor experiences and events, Roundhouse Entertainment is known for producing a day on the green, Australia’s original and premier outdoor winery concert series.

Why? Because around here my focus is on being a conduit for providing greater outcomes that people come here for. My day to day “work” is living in the moment, and I love helping others concentrate on finding their connection to themselves through their experiences.\n\nWhy start a music environment? The truth is I love music, I love writing, and I love life. I work with musicians every day, and I feel certain that I will be until they put me in the ground. I have been managing people in businesses of some sort for over thirty five years so along the way I have developed some “wisdom” from my regular and constant “observations”.\n\nAmnplify your experience. That is what we want you to do here, and if you want to let me know why you do, or don’t, shoot me a message on Facebook.\n\nHope you enjoy yourself here and find something that hits you somewhere."
