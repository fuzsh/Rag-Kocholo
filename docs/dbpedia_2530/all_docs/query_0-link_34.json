        "text": "\"THAT'S going to be annoying me later tonight,\" grumbles the fiftysomething taxi driver as the muffled, pounding beats of the Presets' sound check greet us upon our arrival at Adelaide's Thebarton Theatre.\n\nYou have to feel for the less electronica-inclined locals in the otherwise quiet South Australian capital. Sydney's all-conquering electro-pop duo the Presets - Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes - have been taking their exuberant live show to audiences all over the world and their approach couldn't be more at odds with what Hamilton politely refers to as Adelaide's \"different pace\".\n\nHamilton and Moyes met at the classical music department of Sydney University in 1995. With some fellow students they formed the experimental, classically influenced collective Prop but when their interest waned they decided - as Moyes told the Herald in 2005 - \"to do some good stuff about life and partying and drugs and girls\". The Presets were born.\n\nThey never expected to get big, especially after the underground appeal of their first album, 2005's seamy, lascivious Beams , suggested the mainstream might be beyond their grasp. But that changed with the 2007 release of the ferocious, anthemic My People .\n\nNearly 18 months later, it has become the longest-running Australian single in the ARIA top 100. Only Justin Timberlake's SexyBack has been there longer (79 weeks), a record My People may equal on June 8.\n\nThe single's parent album Apocalypso followed and with it came even more hits, from the elec tronic funk-pop of This Boy's In Love and Yippiyo-Ay (think the Pet Shop Boys covering Thriller ) to the dramatic melancholy of If I Know You and the camp, deliriously infectious Talk Like That .\n\nApocalypso won the Presets three ARIA awards, including album of the year and best group, plus three ARIA Artisan awards for technical achievements, including producers of the year. The album has achieved triple-platinum status in Australia - more than 210,000 units sold - and people still can't seem to get enough of it. \"It is a bit strange when you hear your music played alongside Pink and Kings Of Leon and all that kind of stuff on commercial radio,\" Hamilton says in the band's dressing room following the sound check. \"But it's not a bad thing.\"\n\nMost of the time.\n\n\"I was at a football game a couple of weeks ago at Homebush and the team I wasn't going for scored a try,\" he adds. \"I was like, 'F---'? and then Talk Like That came blasting out over the PA and everyone was dancing. I thought, 'This is crazy.' I was kind of hiding.\"\n\n\"We're getting used to [success],\" Moyes chips in. \"I think maybe it could be a career.\"\n\nOn one of three tours across the US in the past 12 months, the Presets played the prestigious Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival alongside the Cure, the Chemical Brothers and Paul McCartney, with whom their set clashed.\n\n\"Everyone keeps asking us, 'Were you worried going up against Paul McCartney?',\" Hamilton says. \"I was like, 'Well, we're not really going up against him.\"'\n\nYet still Hamilton describes playing gigs as \"just another day at the office\". Surely the idea of life in the Presets being like a real job should set alarm bells ringing?\n\n\"It feels more like a job now that we have a more comfortable role in it,\" Moyes says. \"Whereas before, when we were doing everything when we first started out - we had to cart our own gear around and get crammed into a tiny little van - it just felt like agony. We knew we had to go through this period of torture to get to a point where we could have a job. [Now] we get to oversee things and, like, tell people off and stuff.\"\n\nLife is certainly better at this juncture of what will be the band's last Australian tour before they disappear for a while - first to recharge, then to get to work on album number three \"however long it takes\".\n\nAt the second of their two sold-out Adelaide shows, Moyes and Hamilton have their girlfriends visiting. Spirits are high. Relations between the pair seem good, too, despite their having lived in each other's pockets in cities from the glamorous to the uninspiring for the better part of a year. Surely they should be sick of each other by now?\n\n\"We get that,\" Hamilton says. \"But I think that's just part and parcel - Kim and I decided a long time ago that there was definitely something worth pursuing between us. We really like making music together and we're dear friends.\n\n\"It's almost like family, too. I mean, sometimes you have big arguments with your family but most of the time it's something you really can't let go of.\"\n\n\"We've grown up together as people and have had an amazing journey as musicians, as well,\" Moyes says, \"so there's a lot of invested time on all sorts of levels between the two of us.\"\n\nWhat next then, for the Presets, the band that has it all: huge sales, critical acclaim and a mantelpiece buckling under the weight of myriad awards?\n\n\"Well, I think we try to approach that stuff really simply and just do what we do and make another record,\" Moyes says. \"Like, we never really set out with ambitions to conquer the Australian music industry or any music industry or be the kings ?\"\n\n\"It just happened!\" Hamilton says. \"I guess what we're doing now is pretty much exactly what we were doing 10 years ago, it's just a lot more comfortable. Really, our only priorities 10 years ago were just to write music and record albums and perform for people.\n\n\"Back then we had to work day jobs or we were on the dole or, y'know, we taught piano lessons or whatever to get to do it. After that we worked with other bands and produced other records for other people or played keyboards in Silverchair or whatever. Now we just do the thing we want to do - but that thing has always been the same thing: we wanna just keep on making music.\"\n\nA Saturday night out in Adelaide with the Presets proves not to be as debauched as expected but that's more to do with the reality of life on tour - you can't party every night - than being on best behaviour because of girlfriends and third-wheel journalists.\n\nHamilton only has a couple of post-gig glasses of champagne before he and partner Janice Petersen, co-anchor of SBS World News Australia , turn in for the night, while Moyes doesn't touch a drop; he even drives the rest of us (including his girlfriend, Mia, and the band's manager, Will Larnach-Jones) to the after-show party, where he's DJ-ing.\n\nConsiderably more impressive than their restrained behaviour is the Presets' current live set, which they reworked earlier this year. When the band played Sydney last June the songs seemed to stay close to the album versions, lending complaints of \"karaoke Presets\" some weight. (Not necessarily fair weight - this is such complicated music that samplers will always have to play a part.) Now people know the tunes, the Presets have been freed to do what they want with them.\n\nSo, Eucalyptus comes boosted with Moyes providing thrash metal-style drums, while If I Know You and classic oldie Are You The One? get thorough, unexpected, exhilarating facelifts. Talk Like That , with its building organ intro, is not only a reminder that we're in the City of Churches but that a Presets gig can be akin to a religious experience. And all this is before we get to the eye-popping, brain-melting light show. With performances such as these, on top of the sheer ubiquity of Apocalypso , it's hardly surprising people from all walks of life now recognise the duo.\n\n\"The guy at the greengrocer at the markets asked me to sign his wall of fame today,\" Hamilton says. \"The only other people up there were footballers, AFL players.\"\n\n\"Every day in this position that we're in is a f---ing gift,\" Moyes says. \"Wherever there's a desire for people to see us ?\"\n\nHamilton pertinently clarifies: \"Wherever a kid wants to dance ?\""
