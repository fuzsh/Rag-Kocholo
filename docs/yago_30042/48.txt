Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh’s divorce battle was far from graceful and private. While Amrita, time and again, had opened up on her traumatic and troublesome marriage, not to forget levying allegations against Saif for all his inconstancies, the latter too opened up about his side of the story. In an interview back then, Saif Ali Khan had openly spoken about the hefty alimony Amrita had demanded from him and that he was committed to paying it all at the cost of even his life. In his words:

"I'm supposed to give Amrita Rs 5 crore, of which I've already given her approximately Rs 2.5 crore. Also, I'm paying Rs 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18. I'm not Shah Rukh Khan. I don't have that kind of money. I've promised her I'll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I've to slog till I drop dead."

How Saif found his relationship with Amrita gradually impossible

During the public spree of their divorce proceedings, Saif once mentioned the shocking reason his marriage with Amrita Singh did not work out, and he felt it impossible to carry on with her. Revealing how he was constantly reminded of his guilt on walking away from a relationship that gave him no solace in all the years, he mentioned:

ADVT.

“I really want my kids. But I don't want to put up a constant fight over them. If they are to be taken away from me then let Amrita call them Sara Singh and Ibrahim Singh. Let my daughter become 18 and ask me, 'Where were you Dad, when my brother and I needed you'' Let me die of shame. But please don't kill me with a feeling of constant guilt just because I've had the courage to finally walk away from an impossible relationship to find some solace."
