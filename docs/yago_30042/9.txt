Before tying the knot with Kareena Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan was married to Amrita Singh and the duo parted ways in 2004. In 2008, Kareena said that she will ‘always respect’ Amrita and is a fan of her work adding that she wants her to be friends with Saif.

“I respect the fact that Saif was married before and has two lovely children. I have been a fan of Amrita Singh. I haven’t met her ever but I know her through her films. For me, she’ll always have a place of importance in his life because she is Saif Ali Khan’s first wife and the mother of his children. And, I’ve told Saif this,” said Bebo while talking to People magazine.

She added, “I would want her to have that kind of respect always. This is what my parents have taught me. At the end of the day, it was just a marriage that didn’t work out. I have always encouraged Saif to be friends with her because I think that would be great. I guess they will just need time but that’s something that they would need to deal with. I will always respect her. As far as any other relationship of Saif is concerned, I don’t think they really mattered.”
