The couple then came out and waved at their fans.\n\nThe hugely popular stars, dubbed Saifeena by the paparazzi, are known as Bollywood's \"first couple\".\n\nKhan is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore, a former actress.\n\nKapoor is the granddaughter of actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor and niece of actor Rishi Kapoor.

At least two more receptions are planned for the newly-weds.\n\nKhan, who is 42, was previously married to actress Amrita Singh and they have two children who are now teenagers.\n\nFor the 32-year-old Kapoor, it is her first marriage.\n\nKhan has acted in more than 40 movies and won acclaim for Omkara, a Bollywood version of William Shakespeare's Othello.\n\nKapoor has starred in nearly 50 films. She has won critical acclaim for many of her performances and won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her 2007 hit Jab we met (When we met)."
