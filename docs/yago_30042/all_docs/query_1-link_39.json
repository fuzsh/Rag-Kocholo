        "text": "When Kareena Kapoor weds Saif Ali Khan at the Pataudi Palace in Pataudi village on October 16, she plans to retain her identity.\n\nEven though Kareena is keen to become the Begum of Pataudi, she has plans to have a Hindu wedding and in all probability, will not convert to Islam for her marriage to Saif, the newly anointed Nawab of Pataudi.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThough Bebo will reportedly adorn mother-in-law Sharmila Tagore's bridal finery - a heavily embellished shararakurti with dupatta - she might not acquire a Muslim name or identity.\n\n\"I would never want her (Kareena) to change her religion. That is the trouble with religion really... it expects conversion. I don't buy or believe that. I think it's good that the government, too, has unless I'm misinformed about the lawamended to include it in the Special Marriage Act. If and when we do get married, no one has to change his or her religion,\" Saif Ali Khan said in an interview recently.\n\nKareena has always maintained she follows all religions and has been visiting a church ever since she was a child since her mother Babita's mom was Catholic. She had earlier hinted that she would have a Hindu marriage.\n\nIn the earlier inter-faith marriages of the Pataudi family, women converted to Islam for the nikaah. Saif's parents', Sharmila and late cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, had a traditional nikaah ceremony in 1969. Sharmila, a Bengali from Rabindranath Tagore's family, converted to Islam and took the name of Ayesha Begum. Similarly, Saif' s first marriage to actress Amrita Singh in 1991 was also a Muslim wedding. Amrita, who followed the Sikh religion since childhood, was converted to Islam by a maulavi for the secret wedding. She also adopted a Muslim name.\n\nPreparations for the Saifeena wedding have begun at Pataudi Palace. Some portions of the palace will be renovated and several rooms re-done. \"Madam (Sharmila) is currently in London and the main preparations will start once she returns on July 20. The marriage ceremony will take place at Pataudi Palace and it will be bustling with guests. We are not yet aware whether they will go for a nikaah or a Hindu marriage,\" a source said.\n\nThough it is managed by Neemrana Hotels, some portions of the palace still belong to the Pataudi family.top"
