Recently, Kareena spoke at length about her professional and personal life in an interview.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKareena Kapoor shares what it is like to be married to another actor\n\nBebo turned muse for The Week's July edition as she completed 25 years in the industry. During her interaction, she shared what it is like to be married to another actor. For the unversed, Kareena got married to Saif Ali Khan in 2012. Later, the couple welcomed their two sons, Taimur and Jeh. While answering the question, the actress said that it is definitely tough being married to another actor. She said:\n\n\"It’s very tough (being married to an actor). Sometimes, he’s sleeping when I’ve left for work. I won’t see him living in the same house; we’re trying to take time out for the kids. Two actors in the same house.\"\n\nRecommended Read: Mohammed Shami Finally Addresses Rumours Of His Marriage With Sania Mirza, 'Zabardasti Kiya Hai...'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nKareena Kapoor says that her husband, Saif, has taken her for granted\n\nContinuing her statement, Kareena highlighted that her life has gotten better, and she has changed for good ever since she tied the knot with Saif. The 43-year-old added that her husband keeps her grounded whenever she starts to act a bit crazy. Moreover, the actress also mentioned that both of them sought each other's advice on various things.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKareena shared that she asks her husband for advice, and he does that, too. However, she isn't sure if Saif has ever implemented her ideas. She further stated that Saif hadn't seen her most recent release, Crew, co-starring Tabu and Kriti Sanon, owing to his busy shoot schedule. Saying that Saif has taken her for granted, Kareena added:\n\nadvertisement\n\n“I always ask him for advice, and he does (ask me, too). I don’t know if he takes my advice. I am critical of his films. He hasn’t seen Crew, can you believe it? He’s been shooting, so see. But I have to see all his films…so in that sense, yeah, he’s taken me for granted this time.\"\n\nDon't Miss: Payal Malik Supports Armaan And Kritika After Their Alleged Intimate Video From 'BB OTT 3' Surfaced\n\nadvertisement.\n\nKareena Kapoor talks about how only female actors are asked about 'comebacks' after marriage and kids\n\nIn the same conversation, Kareena Kapoor discussed comebacks in the industry. The actress, who started out in the industry with J.P. Dutta's 2000 film Refugee, has worked in nearly 70 movies to date. She asked a very thought-provoking question about why 'comebacks' are associated with only female actors and not men. Sharing that she felt equal to her male counterparts, Kareena said:\n\n\"Today, I don’t feel any less than my male counterparts. What does ‘comeback’ mean? Male stars don’t have comebacks, why do only female stars do? I am married and have two children but so do a lot of male actors in the industry.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat do you think of Kareena Kapoor Khan's candid revelations about her marriage with Saif Ali Khan?\n\nAlso Read: Avika Gor Talks About Her Friendship With 'Jagya' Of 'Balika Vadhu': 'Hum Same School Mein The...'\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
