        "text": "Bollywood glamour couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor, who have been dating for five years, finally tied the knot in Mumbai on Tuesday in a much-anticipated Indian celebrity wedding. Kapoor, 32, and Khan, 42 -- India's answer to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie -- held a quiet official ceremony at the groom's home, which will be followed by an evening reception at the grand Taj Mahal Palace hotel. The newly-weds married in front of close friends and family, before emerging to pose and wave to the large press pack and fans waiting outside. Kapoor was dressed in an embellished red shawl, while Khan wore a simple grey kurta. \"It was a registered marriage with three witnesses -- Kareena's father Randhir Kapoor, her mother Babita and Saif's mother Sharmila Tagore,\" marriage registrar Surekha Ramesh told the Press Trust of India news agency. The couple, dubbed \"Saifeena\" by the media, come from famous acting families and their wedding attracting frenzied media attention. \"Party time\" ran the headline in the Mail Today, which offered breathless coverage of a pre-wedding function in Mumbai on Sunday evening. \"Dressed every inch like a bride-to-be, Kareena dazzled in an orange-yellow lehenga (skirt) and a shimmering golden choli (top),\" it said. \"Beau Saif Ali Khan turned out more on the simpler side. He looked dapper in a white outfit.\" Superstar actor Shah Rukh Khan -- no relation to the groom -- was one of the first big names to congratulate the couple on Twitter. \"Happiest marriage bond to my friend Saif & Kareena. May Allah keep (your) family healthy & happy. Just saw it is registered, sealed & delivered,\" he wrote. Friends have been tight-lipped about the private event, but the bride's uncle, actor Rishi Kapoor, confirmed to AFP that the wedding day would be followed by a reception in Delhi in the near future. \"It is a very joyous moment for our family,\" he said. Another celebration is reportedly planned at the Pataudi Palace, the ancestral home of Khan in northern Haryana state. Khan became the new Nawab (Muslim prince) of the former princely state of Pataudi last year after the death of his famous cricketing father Mansur Ali Khan, well known as \"Tiger Pataudi\". Khan's mother is an award-winning actress and his sister Soha is also in the movie business. Kapoor hails from one of Bollywood's foremost acting dynasties, started by her great-grandfather Prithviraj. Her grandfather Raj Kapoor was a cinematic legend while his brothers and a number of relatives have become well-known names in the industry. Khan, who has appeared in about 50 films including 2001's \"Dil Chahta Hai\" (The Heart Desires) and \"Hum Tum\" (You and Me, 2004), has two children with his previous wife Amrita Singh. They divorced in 2004. Kapoor, entering her first marriage, has similar number of film credits to her name including hits such as \"3 Idiots\" (2009) and \"Jab We Met\" (When We Met, 2007). She appeared alongside Khan in this year's spy flick \"Agent Vinod\"."
