        "text": "Bollywood stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor are one of the most popular couples in Bollywood. They have been together for over 15 years, and the couple is often snapped spending quality time and enjoying their togetherness. But there was a time when Saif Ali Khan found himself trapped and needed to find himself in an impossible marriage with Amrita Singh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor married Amrita Singh in 1991, and after 13 years of marriage, they parted ways in 2004, citing ‘incompatibility’ as the reason. While many stories paved their way on the internet regarding their divorce, the two always remained tight-lipped over the issue.\n\nIn an old interview with The Telegraph, Saif spoke about his equation with Amrita Singh, the alimony he had to pay, his Swiss girlfriend Rosa, and his love for his children. He began by saying that he and his wife had gone their separate ways.Â âBut why am I being constantly reminded of how terrible a husband I was and how awful a father I am? I have my son Ibrahimâs photograph in my wallet. Each time I look at it, I feel like crying. I miss my daughter Sarah all the time,â he said.\n\nHe expressed his predicament that his children arenât even allowed to visit him, let alone stay with him. âWhy? Because thereâs a new woman in my life whoâd influence my children against their mother. Thatâs so much gibberish, and Amrita knows it,â he added.\n\nIn the brutally honest throwback interview, Saif revealed shocking details about his âextravagantâ post-divorce financial arrangements with Amrita. âIâm supposed to give Amrita Rs 5 crore, of which Iâve already given her approximately Rs 2.5 crore. Also, Iâm paying Rs 1 lakh per month until my son turns 18,â he said. He went on to say that he is not Shah Rukh Khan and that he doesnât possess that kind of money. Despite not having plenty of resources, he has promised to fulfil his financial responsibilities, even if he has to slog till he drops dead.Â Â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaborating further, the âAdipurushâ actor said, âWhatever Iâve earned from advertisements, stage shows, and movies is for my children. I have no money. Our bungalow is for Amrita and the kids, and never mind the relatives whoâve joined her after my departure,â he added.\n\nSaif further confessed that even though he was staying in a pokey two-room apartment with his ex-girlfriend Rosa, heâs never been more at peace with himself. Also, after a long time, he could feel his self-worth returning. He added, âIt isnât nice to be constantly reminded of how worthlessÂ you are and to have taunts, jeers, insults, and abuses thrown at your mother and sister all the time.Â Iâve gone through all of it. Now I feel healed again. Today, if Iâve found someone who actually makes me feel like Iâm worth something, whatâs wrong with it?â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nâUnlike Amrita, Rosa is not from the film industry. Sure, I liked being put in touch with the industryâs bigwigs by Amrita, having dinner with Karan Johar, etc. But in hindsight, Iâd have been better off finding my way through the industry,â he added.\n\nSaif also mentioned that Amrita had a big hand in his growth as an actor and human being because Amrita took him by the finger and led him through it all. But it is aÂ blessing to be with a woman who has nothing to do with movies, referring to his Swiss girlfriend Rosa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe concluded by saying that he really wanted his kids to be with him, but he didnât want to put up a constant fight over them. âLet me die of shame. But please donât kill me with a feeling of constant guilt just because Iâve had the courage to finally walk away from an impossible relationship to find some solace. I want no confrontation with Amrita. She was, and will remain, an integral part of my life. I want her and my kids to be happy.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, his children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan have caused a stir in the entertainment industry. While Sara Ali Khan has made a name for herself in the Hindi film industry with her versatile acting prowess, fashion statements, and globetrotting videos, Ibrahim is all set to make his Bollywood debut under the filmmaker Karan Johar in Sarzameen, opposite Kajol and Prithviraj Sukumaran. The film will mark the directorial debut of Kayoze Irani, son of Boman Irani."
