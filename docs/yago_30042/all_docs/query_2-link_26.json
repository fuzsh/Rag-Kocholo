        "text": "Kareena says people marry now only to have kids\n\n“The reason you get married now is that you want to have a child, right? I mean today otherwise you can just live together. We [Saif Ali Khan and I] lived together for five years, so when we took the next step, it was because we wanted to have children,\" Kareena told the magazine.\n\nKareena and Saif married in October 2012 in Mumbai, after a few years of dating. He was earlier married to actor Amrita Singh. They parted ways in 2004. Saif and Amrita have two children Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. Saif and Kareena have two sons – Taimur Ali Khan (born in 2016) and Jehangir Ali Khan (born in 2021).\n\nKareena on parenting\n\nKareena said her approach to parenting is simple – 'There is no right or wrong way'. Further speaking about parenthood, Kareena said, \"We treat them (the kids) as individuals, we respect them, and we just let them be. They will figure it out, they will find their own path. Kids are quite resilient, you know... I want to live my life in front of my kids, I want to do everything with them. We have to be happy na, then they will flourish. I’m responsible for my own mental health first.”\n\nKareena's recent projects\n\nKareena made her OTT debut with filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh's Jaane Jaan, an adaptation of the Japanese novel Devotion of Suspect X. It was released on Netflix on September 21. The film also features Vijay Varma and Jaideep Ahlawat. She was also seen in director Hansal Mehta's film The Buckingham Murders. Kareena now has The Crew alongside Tabu, Kriti Sanon and Diljit Dosanjh in pipeline. It is all set to hit theatres on March 22, 2024."
