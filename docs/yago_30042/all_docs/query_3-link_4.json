        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan are one of the most-loved couples in B-Town. The duo stayed in a live-in relationship for 5 years before tying the knot in 2012. In an interview with The Week recently, she joked how Saif takes her for granted and the flipside of two stars married to each other.\n\nKareena said, “He is like he has not seen Crew. Can you believe it? Because heâs been shooting but I have to see all his films. And I am very like âI have to because I have toâ so in that sense he has just taken me for granted.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added, “We surely fight over the AC temperature because Saif wants 16 deg C because he is feeling hot all the time and I am like, âSaifâ and he is like âI know people have got divorced because of AC temperatureâ. So he wants 16 and I want 20, and he’s like letâs settle for 19, which is not too bad. And every time Karisma comes home and we are having dinner, Lolo slyly changes the temperature to 25 and Saif is like, âGod! Thank God I am married to Bebo because at least she settles for 19.”\n\nIn a recent conversation, Bebo revealed what attracted her to the Omkara star. She told Ranveer Allahabadia on his podcast, âIt was his natural-caring eyes that caught my attention.â\n\nAlso, in a recent conversation, Bebo opened up about her decision to marry his Kurbaan costar.\n\nThe reason you get married now is that you want to have a child, right? I mean today otherwise you can just live together. We (Â Saif Ali KhanÂ and I) lived together for five years, so when we took the next step, it was because we wanted to have children,â said Kareena while talking to The Dirty Magazine.\n\nTalking about parenthood, Kareena said Saif treats their sons Taimur and Jeh as individuals and respects them as their core personality. âWe treat them (the kids) as individuals, we respect them, and we just let them be. They will figure it out, they will find their own path. Kids are quite resilient, you knowâ¦ I want to live my life in front of my kids, I want to do everything with them. We have to be happy na, then they will flourish. Iâm responsible for my own mental health first,â said the Laal Singh Chaddha actress."
