        "text": "Synopsis\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan recently revealed that she and Saif Ali Khan often argue over trivial matters rather than significant issues like money. In a candid interview, Kareena shared that their biggest disagreements revolve around the air conditioning temperature, with Saif preferring 16°C and Kareena preferring 20°C, often settling at 19°C. Additionally, they struggle with finding time for each other due to their busy acting careers.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan, one of Bollywood's most admired couples, have been making headlines not just for their successful careers but also for their enduring relationship. Married since 2012, the couple is set to celebrate their 12th wedding anniversary this October. Despite their seemingly perfect life, Kareena recently shed light on the realities of their relationship, revealing what truly causes friction between them.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Week, Kareena shared how her marriage has influenced her personally. \"Marriage has changed me for the better. I am more responsible now. We feed off each other—if he grounds me, I ground him,\" she explained. Kareena elaborated that their mutual support is a cornerstone of their relationship, although it comes with its challenges.\n\nOne of the primary difficulties the couple faces is managing their busy schedules. Kareena provided a glimpse into their life, saying, \"It is tough. Saif came home at 4:30 AM, was sleeping when I left for work, and then he left for a shoot. I’m flying to Bangkok tomorrow, so we won’t see each other even though we live in the same house. Balancing time is difficult, and we often need to coordinate our schedules with a calendar.\"\n\nWhy Do Saif-Kareena Fight?\n\nWhen asked about the nature of their disagreements, Kareena highlighted a humorous yet relatable issue: the air conditioning. \"We fight over the AC temperature. Saif prefers it at 16 degrees Celsius, while I want it at 20. We usually compromise at 19. Karisma, when she visits, often changes it to 25, and Saif is grateful that I settle for 19,\" Kareena joked.\n\nAnother point of contention is their lack of quality time together. Kareena said, “I think most of the time the fight is for time because we have not seen each other. We don’t fight about money or anything like that, it is mainly because of the fact we are not getting enough time with each other or the fact that we are not seeing each other. It’s the only thing. And sometimes, I just fight with him because he allows Taimur to stay up a little late and I get fired up blaming him.”\n\nKareena Kapoor's Upcoming Movies\n\nOn the professional front, Kareena Kapoor is gearing up for the release of her upcoming film The Buckingham Murders, directed by Hansal Mehta, set to hit theaters on September 13, 2024. Meanwhile, Saif Ali Khan will be featured in the Telugu film Devara, starring alongside Jr NTR and Janhvi Kapoor, which is scheduled for release on September 27, 2024.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
