        "text": "Saif Ali Khan or the chote nawab of Pataudi, married yesteryear actress, Amrita Singh in October 1991. Unfortunately, their marriage came to a shocking halt 13 years and two children later when the couple separated. Courtesy of their stardom as actors, their splitsville became one of the most hotly debated gossip as the duo revealed many startling reasons behind the same.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen Saif Ali Khan accused ex-wife, Amrita Singh of abusing his family members\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile the duo has moved on peacefully in their lives, they had extensively levied many allegations against one another for their split back then. There was once a time merely months after their separation announcement when Saif revealed in an interview how his ex-wife, Amrita, had constantly insulted and abused his mother and sister during the bitter years of their marital life. In his words:\n\n“It isn't nice to be constantly reminded of how worthless you are and to have taunts, jeers, insults and abuses thrown at your mother and sister all the time. I've gone through all of it.\"\n\nRecommended Read: B-Town Celebs Who Got Married Thrice Or More, From Kishore Kumar, Neelima Azeem To Sanjay Dutt\n\nadvertisement\n\nSaif’s revelation of missing his children, Sara and Ibrahim after divorce\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn another interview after his divorce from Amrita Singh, Saif revealed that he did not like being publicly targeted by his ex-wife’s open untrue allegations.

In an interview back then, Saif Ali Khan had openly spoken about the hefty alimony Amrita had demanded from him and that he was committed to paying it all at the cost of even his life. In his words:\n\n\"I'm supposed to give Amrita Rs 5 crore, of which I've already given her approximately Rs 2.5 crore. Also, I'm paying Rs 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18. I'm not Shah Rukh Khan. I don't have that kind of money. I've promised her I'll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I've to slog till I drop dead.\"\n\nHow Saif found his relationship with Amrita gradually impossible\n\nDuring the public spree of their divorce proceedings, Saif once mentioned the shocking reason his marriage with Amrita Singh did not work out, and he felt it impossible to carry on with her. Revealing how he was constantly reminded of his guilt on walking away from a relationship that gave him no solace in all the years, he mentioned:\n\nADVT.\n\n“I really want my kids. But I don't want to put up a constant fight over them. If they are to be taken away from me then let Amrita call them Sara Singh and Ibrahim Singh. Let my daughter become 18 and ask me, 'Where were you Dad, when my brother and I needed you'' Let me die of shame. But please don't kill me with a feeling of constant guilt just because I've had the courage to finally walk away from an impossible relationship to find some solace.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh’s ugly divorce allegations?\n\nadvertisement\n\nNext Read: From Kirron Kher, Neelima Azeem To Neelam Kothari, Bollywood Divas Who Got Married More Than Once\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
