        "text": "\"Heads I win. Tales you lose.\" I just came across this interview of Amrita Singh from back when she was newly divorced and had just rejoined the entertainment industry after taking a long break for her kids. First of all, I think the interview shows that both Amrita Singh and Pooja Bedi were clearly feminists way before the word 'feminism' came into common parlance in India. That said, the line of questioning for the first half of the interview (no doubt decided by the producers more than Bedi) is all - \"Don't you feel guilty for throwing away your career for marriage and kids?\" In the second half, it switches to - \"Now that you are working again, don't you feel guilty about not spending as much time with your kids?\" Basically, women are damned if they do, damned if they don't. It is amazing how shamelessly society judges women by these obvious double standards. Personally, I did not take a break from my career after motherhood. But I did switch to remote jobs that offered me more flexibility to organize my day around my baby's needs. Such options have become accessible only since the pandemic, so I am not sure which direction I might have gone if they weren't on offer. Yet, I have felt a sense of guilt and shame around some of these career choices. Coming from a cut-throat educational background, I often see women being shamed - either to their faces or behind their backs - for quitting or pausing their careers after marriage or motherhood. Wanting to be a more involved and present parent - the reason most women take a career break - is not a crime. It is actually among the greatest forms of serving humanity and women should be thanked, lauded, and celebrated for it. Equally often, I also see women shamed for \"leaving their kid\" and going to work - something no man in history has ever been shamed for. However, going back to work right after motherhood is another heroic choice, given how our family and work cultures expect women to mother like they don't have a job, and do a job like they are not mothers. So #1 - Stop shaming mothers. Period. #2 - If you need a place to redirect all the shaming, I have a few suggestions. Please shame: ðŸ’© The husbands and fathers who do not show up for their marriage and parenthood in a spirit of equity with their partners. In B-school, we used to call people who joined a project group but did not contribute \"free riders\". I had no idea that the term actually applied to a majority of husbands and dads out there. ðŸ’© Families that have insanely high and unachievable standards for mothers, but give a criminally free pass to fathers. ðŸ’© Employers who do not treat people like human beings with a life and responsibilities outside of work. They skew the workplace further in favor of men who are shirking household responsibilities, making workplaces downright hostile for mothers and fathers who want to strike a balance. ** If you need help making a choice like this: topmate.io/mahimavashisht"
