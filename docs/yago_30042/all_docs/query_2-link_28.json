        "text": "Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan is thankful to have been married to A-list heroine Kareena Kapoor, and not her elder sister, and his frequent co-star, Karisma Kapoor.\n\nDuring an interview with a digital media outlet, Bollywood diva Kareena Kapoor, who has been married to fellow actor Saif Ali Khan for over a decade, revealed two major reasons for her fights with her husband. She also explained why it is tough to be married to an actor.\n\nHere are the exact words of the lady:\n\n“We surely fight over the AC temperature because Saif wants 16 degrees Celsius because he feels hot all the time and I am like, ‘Saif’ and he is like ‘I know people have got divorced because of AC temperature”, Kapoor shared.\n\n“So he wants 16 and I want 20, and he would be like, ‘Let’s settle for 19’, which is not too bad.”\n\nShe continued, “And every time Karisma comes home, and we are having dinner, she changes the temperature to 25 and Saif is like, ‘God! Thank God I am married to Bebo because at least she settles for 19′.”\n\nAnother major reason for Kareena and Saif's arguments is time. \"I think most of the time the fight is for time because we have not seen each other. We don’t fight about money or anything like that, it is mainly because of the fact we are not getting enough time with each other or the fact that we are not seeing each other. It’s the only thing. And sometimes, I just fight with him because he allows Taimur to stay up a little late and I get fired up blaming him,\" shared the 'Crew' actor.\n\nShe further explained the challenges of being married to an actor saying, \"He came at 4:30 in the morning, he was sleeping and I left for work and he is woken up and probably left for a shoot, and then I am flying to Bangkok tomorrow, so I won’t see him even though we are living in the same house. Balancing time is difficult. We sit down with the calendar to fix this day that time. This is what happens when there are two actors in the house.”\n\nPertinent to note here that Bollywood diva Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan have been married since 2012 and are parents to two sons, Taimur, 6, and Jeh, 2."
