        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan have been married for 12 years now. The couple has two sons Taimur Ali Khan and Jehangir Ali Khan. In a recent interview, the actress joked about how Saif has taken her for granted and revealed the reason for fights between them.\n\nIn an interview with The Week, Kareena Kapoor Khan talked about how marriage has changed her and said, \"Marriage has changed me for the better. I am more responsible. We feed off each other. We are like, ‘if he grounds me, I ground him’. If I am going a little crazy, he will always tell me and vice versa.”\n\nWhen asked if the relationship is tough given they are both actors, Kareena agreed and said, “Of course it is. It is very tough,” and explained, “He came at 4:30 in the morning, he was sleeping and I left for work and he is woken up and probably left for a shoot and then I am flying to Bangkok tomorrow, so I won’t see him even though we are living in the same house. Balancing time is difficult. We sit down with the calendar to fix this day at that time. This is what happens when there are two actors in the house.”\n\nTalking about watching each other's films, Kareena Kapoor revealed that Saif hadn't watched Crew yet and said, \"He is like he has not seen Crew. Can you believe it? Because he’s been shooting but I have to see all his films. And I am very like ‘I have to because I have to’ so in that sense he has just taken me for granted.”\n\nKareena further revealed that they fight over the AC temperature and said, \"We surely fight over the AC temperature because Saif wants 16 deg C because he is feeling hot all the time and I am like, ‘Saif’ and he is like ‘I know people have got divorced because of AC temperature’. So he wants 16 and I want 20, and he be like let’s settle for 19, which is not too bad. And every time Karisma comes home and we are having dinner, Lolo slyly changes the temperature to 25 and Saif is like, ‘God! Thank God I am married to Bebo because at least she settles for 19.\"\n\nThe actress further revealed that most of their fights are because of 'time' and said, \"I think most of the time the fight is for time because we have not seen each other. We don’t fight about money or anything like that, it is mainly because of the fact we are not getting enough time with each other or the fact that we are not seeing each other. It’s the only thing. And sometimes, I just fight with him because he allows Taimur to stay up a little late and I get fired up blaming him.”\n\nOn the work front, Saif Ali Khan will be seen making his Telugu debut opposite Jr NTR in Devara. The actor is set to play the role of the main antagonist in the movie. Kareena Kapoor Khan, on the other hand, will be seen sharing the screen with Ajay Devgn, Deepika Padukone, Tiger Shroff, Ranveer Singh, and Arjun Kapoor in Singham Again. Helmed by Rohit Shetty, the film is scheduled to release in theatres this Diwali."
