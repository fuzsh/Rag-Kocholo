        "text": "Bollywood star couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor on Tuesday, tied the knot here in a quiet affair after a five-year courtship.\n\nMr Saif, 42, son of late Nawab of Pataudi and former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore, sealed his relationship with Ms Kareena, 32, at his residence in suburban Bandra through a registered marriage.\n\n“It was a registered marriage with three witnesses — Ms Kareena’s father Randhir Kapoor, her mother Babita and Mr Saif’s mother Sharmila,” marriage Registrar Surekha Ramesh told PTI.\n\nThe couple who started dating in 2007, married in the presence of close friends and family this afternoon.\n\nThe couple had officially declared their intention to tie the knot in the beginning of 2012 after the release of their film ‘Agent Vinod’ in March.\n\nMr Randhir and his elder daughter Karisma later waved to the waiting fans and media from the balcony of the house.\n\nMs Kareena wore a green salwar-kurta with a heavy embellished red dupatta wrapped around her. She teamed it up with minimal jewelry, red bangles and left her hair open.\n\nMr Saif, simply dressed in a grey kurta and white pajamas, came out with his new wife to greet fans from his balcony.\n\nThere is a buzz that a reception will be held on Wednesday at a city hotel. This will be followed by another reception in Delhi on October 18, and a ceremony at Mr Saif’s ancestral Pataudi Palace in Haryana.\n\nAlthough Mr Saif and Ms Kareena had maintained silence on their much awaited wedding, it was Mr Saif’s mother Ms Sharmila who came out with the October wedding date.\n\nMr Saif and Ms Kareena featured together for the first time in the 2008 movie ‘Tashan’, followed by ‘Kurbaan’ They were last seen in Khan’s home production ‘Agent Vinod’ in March this year.\n\nThe actor duo, popularly called ‘Saifeena’, have appeared in several advertisements also.\n\nMs Sharmila had converted to Islam after her marriage to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. Earlier during an event, when asked if she would convert to Islam, Ms Kareena had said, “It is a very personal question and I cannot answer it.”\n\nAfter the death of his father, Mr Saif was anointed the new Nawab of Pataudi."
