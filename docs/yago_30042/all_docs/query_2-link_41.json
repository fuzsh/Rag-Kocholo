        "text": "Saif Ali Khan’s & Kareena Kapoor’s wedding ceremony was nothing short of a princess style wedding. Their love story is a tale of grandeur in every sense. While Saif is a Nawab or a prince, Kareena is the princess of millions of hearts. Born into one of the most influential Bollywood families of India, Kareena Kapoor Khan is an actress known for her sense of style. Nawab Saif on the other comes from the family of Pataudis and actors, with a father who enjoyed a renowned cricketing career and mother who was the most popular actress of her times. Their grand wedding in 2012 served as a perfect ending to this movie.\n\nTheir love story\n\nTime and again, Kareena has mentioned that she was always attracted to Saif. She candidly admitted to being his fan even before she began her career in Bollywood. Saif Ali Khan, on the other hand, was married to Amrita Arora and nurtured two children with her, but divorced few months before he started dating Kareena Kapoor. The couple fell in love during the shoot of Tashan, when Kareena had been distancing herself from actor and her then boyfriend, Shahid Kapoor. Sparks flew between them and even before the release of their movie, Saif and Kareena admitted that they were dating each other.\n\nThe couple initially kept their lives private and didn’t divulge the details of their relationship. It was when Saif tattooed the name of Kareena on his hand that media and fans realized the depth of love in their relationship. Saif recently told in an interview that the tattoo was symbolic of the fact that Kareena was the only woman in his life and that he wished to settle with.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nSaif Ali Khan proposed to Kareena during a romantic trip to Paris. The actress instantly agreed. The couple, during the peak of their careers decided to get married and Kareena informed the media that she would continue doing movies even after getting married. Small ceremonies were held at Kareena Kapoor’s residence. The Kapoor family organized a Mehendi and Sangeet ceremony. Wedding was a solemn affair, following Islamic rituals and customs of a ‘Nikaah.’\n\nThe Wedding Trousseau\n\nKareena Kapoor, known for her stunning face and curvaceous body, looked beautiful and sensual in all her wedding outfits. During the Sangeet, she sizzled in a golden choli and a stunning orange-yellow Lehenga, which accentuated her curves and added a bright glow to her face. The jewelry was the same that she wore during Karishma, her sister’s wedding. For the Mehendi ceremony, the actress kept it simple and donned a beautiful pink sari that showed off her svelte figure and complemented her fair skin. The diamond jewelry and accessories gave her an enigmatic look.\n\nShe wore a beautiful ‘Gharara’ which Sharmila had worn during the wedding. The Gharara or Lehenga style dress with a long overcoat looked sophisticated and regal for the Nikaah ceremony. The Gharara originally belonged to Saif Ali Khan’s grandmother and was redone by Ritu Kumar for wedding purposes. For registration of marriage, the actress opted for a Mehendi colored Salwar-Kameez with Red dupatta.\n\nIt was the grand reception where she stole all limelight with a burgundy colored embellished Gharara that popular designer Manish Malhotra crafted for her. The doe eyed beauty looked stunningly ravishing in this outfit and completed the ensemble with gold jewelry and emeralds. She went with a tight bun to show off her glowing face.\n\nSaif Ali Khan kept his ensembles minimalistic but sophisticated in every sense. He went with traditional style Pajamas and short Kurta. He also opted for regular kurta and pajama for different ceremonies. On the wedding day, Saif decided to go traditional and chose Raghavendra Rathore to design his outfit. The actor opted for golden achkan and a turban, which added to his physique, complemented his fair face, oval facial structure and well maintained body. The outfit features Banarasi Brocade, which looked classic in every sense. Instead of choosing embroidery, he opted for elaborate attention to cuts and detailing. The cocktail star teamed it with Jodhpuri breeches and a turban.\n\nThe wedding between Saif and Kareena would be remembered for years, thanks to the grand outfits and the grandeur look that the couple sported during celebrations.\n\nReferences"
