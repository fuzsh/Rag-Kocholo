        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan recently lifted the curtain on the unique dynamics of being married to another actor, sharing her thoughts in an interview with The Week. With a hint of humour, she revealed that her husband, Saif Ali Khan, sometimes takes her “for granted”.\n\nKareena discussed the juggle between her professional and personal life, emphasising the importance of family time. “It’s very tough (being married to an actor),” she admitted. “Sometimes, he’s sleeping when I’ve left for work. I won’t see him living in the same house; we’re trying to take time out for the kids. Two actors in the same house.”\n\nDespite the challenges, the Jab We Met actor believes her marriage has been transformative. “I’ve changed for the better,” she said, adding that Saif plays a crucial role in keeping her grounded when she’s feeling a bit out of sorts. “He grounds me when I’m going a little crazy.”\n\nThe couple also turns to each other for advice, though Kareena joked about how effective that advice really is. “I always ask him for advice, and he does (ask me, too). I don’t know if he takes my advice. I am critical of his films. He hasn’t seen Crew, can you believe it? He’s been shooting. But I have to see all his films. So, in that sense, yes, he’s taken me for granted this time.”\n\nKareena was last seen in Crew, alongside Tabu and Kriti Sanon. Her next big screen venture will be Singham Again, featuring an ensemble cast with Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Ranveer Singh, and Deepika Padukone, set to hit theatres on November 1. Before that, she will grace the screen in The Buckingham Murders, which is slated for release on September 13. Meanwhile, Saif is making waves with his upcoming Tollywood debut in the Telugu film Devara: Part 1."
