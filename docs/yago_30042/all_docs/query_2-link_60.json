        "text": "Candid photos of Saif Ali Khan\n\nAs Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan celebrate their wedding anniversary today, we bring you a recap of their love story.\n\nAfter 13 years of being married to first love Amrita Singh, and then dating Rosa Catalano for three years post his divorce, Saif and Kareena began seeing each other in 2007.\n\nBefore falling for Chhote Nawab, Bebo was in a steady relationship with Shahid Kapoor, from 2004 to 2007. It was during the filming of 'Jab We Met' that they parted ways. Ironically, the Imtiaz Ali film had them playing lovers, and went on to become a huge hit.\n\nStories of the Saif-Kareena linkup began while the two were shooting for Yashraj Films' 'Tashan' in Ladakh and Rajasthan. They worked together in 'Omkara' as well, but sparks flew on the sets of 'Tashan'. They were spotted outside a club in Bandra together, which sparked off rumours of an affair.\n\nAlthough Saif Ali Khan received his share of criticism for leaving his kids (Sara Ali Khan, Ibrahim Ali Khan) and family, he maintained that he was genuinely in love with Kareena Kapoor.\n\nOn the other hand, Kareena Kapoor, who used to be quizzed by the media about her relationship with Saif, always reiterated that destiny brought them together, and that, for her, Saif is the best.\n\nEver since they began dating, Saif and Kareena made no pretensions about their relationship. The couple had walked hand-in-hand at the premiere of Ranbir Kapoor's debut film Saawariya.\n\nKareena Kapoor supported Saif Ali Khan wholeheartedly during the controversy at Taj Hotel when a businessman alleged that the Nawab had punched him.\n\nThough Saifeena became one of the most-loved couples in B-town, they could never translate the same into on-screen success. The pair has acted in films like 'Tashan', 'Kurbaan' and 'Agent Vinod', all of which tanked at the box office.\n\nSaif professed his undying love for Bebo by tattooing 'Kareena' (in Devnagri script) on his arm back in 2008.\n\nAfter innumerable media speculations over the D-day, Saif's mother Sharmila Tagore revealed in July 2012, that the much in love couple would get married in October. The couple tied the knot on October 16, 2012.\n\nSaif and Kareena tied the knot in 2012, but unlike other Bollywood marriages, theirs was a private affair attended by only close family and friends. Saif and Kareena have bonded really well with each other's families and have been each other's pillars of support during testing times.\n\nThe couple is often seen partying and holidaying together and give serious relationship goals to their fans. Kareena Kapoor has broken the stereotype of actresses not working post marriage. Kareena, in fact, worked in several films after her marriage, some of which went on to become blockbusters. Saif is a supporting partner, unlike many other celebs who want to confine their spouses to the home.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor's first child Taimur Ali Khan was born in December 2016. Kareena has bonded well with Saif's kids with Amrita - Sara and Ibrahim.\n\nSaif and Kareena are all set to welcome their second child soon! Kareena and Saif said in a statement: 'We are very pleased to announce that we are expecting an addition to our family!! Thank you to all our well wishers for all their love and support.'\n\nTaking to Instagram to wish hubby Saif a happy anniversary, Bebo shared this photo and wrote, \"Once upon a time there was a girl named Beboo and a boy named Saifu. They both loved sphagetti and wine... and lived happily ever after. Now you guys know the key to a happy marriage. On that note, happy anniversary SAKP... here's to eternity and beyond.\"\n\nHere's wishing the couple a lifetime of happiness!"
