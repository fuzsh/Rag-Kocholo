        "text": "Mumbai: Bollywood star couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor today tied the knot here in a quiet affair after a five-year courtship.\n\nSaif, 42, son of late Nawab of Pataudi and former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore, sealed his relationship with Kareena, 32, at his residence in suburban Bandra through a registered marriage.\n\n\"It was a registered marriage with three witnesses -- Kareena's father Randhir Kapoor, her mother Babita and Saif's mother Sharmila,\" marriage Registrar Surekha Ramesh told PTI.\n\nThe couple who started dating in 2007, married in the presence of close friends and family this afternoon. The couple had officially declared their intention to tie the knot in the beginning of 2012 after the release of their film 'Agent Vinod' in March.\n\nRandhir and his elder daughter Karisma later waved to the waiting fans and media from the balcony of the house. Kareena wore a green salwar-kurta with a heavy embellished red dupatta wrapped around her. She teamed it up with minimal jewelry, red bangles and left her hair open.\n\nSaif, simply dressed in a grey kurta and white pajamas, came out with his new wife to greet fans from his balcony. There is a buzz that a reception will be held tomorrow at a city hotel. This will be followed by another reception in Delhi on October 18 and a ceremony at Saif's ancestral Pataudi Palace in Haryana.\n\nAlthough Saif and Kareena had maintained silence on their much awaited wedding, it was Saif's mother Sharmila who came out with the October wedding date.\n\nSaif has two children - son Ibrahim and daughter Sara - from his previous marriage to actress Amrita Singh. Kareena was in a relationship with Shahid Kapoor earlier.\n\nSaif and Kareena featured together for the first time in the 2008 movie 'Tashan', followed by 'Kurbaan'. They were last seen in Khan's home production 'Agent Vinod' in March this year. Though the film sank without a trace at the box office, the couple's romance soared and began grabbing headlines, forcing Saif to confirm their relationship soon after.\n\nHe further cemented his relationship by inking Kareena's name on his left arm in Hindi. They also paired up for 'Kurbaan' in 2009. The actor duo, popularly called 'Saifeena', has appeared in several advertisements also.\n\nSharmila had converted to Islam after her marriage to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. Earlier during an event, when asked if she would convert to Islam, Kareena had said, \"It is a very personal question and I cannot answer it.\" After the death of his father, Saif was anointed the new Nawab of Pataudi.\n\nKareena, who is the fourth generation member of the famous Kapoor family which boasts of names like Prithviraj Kapoor and Raj Kapoor, is one of the most sought after actresses in Bollywood today. She was last seen in Madhur Bhandarkar's 'Heroine', which released in September."
