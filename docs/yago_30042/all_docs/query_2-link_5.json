        "text": "'He asked me to marry him and that was it'\n\nWhen asked if she was 'edgy and anxious as a wife in the first few years of marriage', Kareena had said, \"I wasn’t edgy or anxious. But it’s a new journey. I started living in with Saif before I got married, not because I wanted to experiment or test. It was because we weren’t getting much time to spend with each other as we were shooting continuously. After that, it was a natural transition. He asked me to marry him and that was it.\"\n\nTaylor Swift is everywhere you look right now. Wonder what's the big deal about her? Read our special story, a primer on everything Swift\n\n'Jaan toh nahi chali jayegi na'\n\nSharing people's reaction, the actor said, \"Everyone was like, ‘Shaadi mat karna, warna career khatam ho jayega (Don't marry, your career will be over)’. I said, ‘Career hi khatam ho jayega na? Jaan toh nahi chali jayegi na (Only my career will end right, I won't die)?’ I love this man (Saif). If living with him means that producers don’t want to work with me, so be it. Of course, after that, I’ve done some good films. Saif has also been extremely encouraging. I only get edgy when we don’t see each other for a long time.\""
