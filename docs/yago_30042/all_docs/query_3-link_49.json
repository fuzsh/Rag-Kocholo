        "text": "This year marks the 20th anniversary of Kareena Kapoor Khan’s Bollywood debut, with 2000’s Refugee. With more than 70 films under her belt and umpteen accolades, the actress – who was born into a film royalty spanning three generations – is still as relevant and in demand as ever.\n\nKapoor credits her longevity for her ability to detach from the trappings of fame and see the bigger picture, as she told Mid-Day. However, it’s undeniable that Bebo (her pet name) knows a thing or two about reinventing herself to beat the rivalries and prejudice rife in Bollywood.\n\nShe reinvented herself as a size 0\n\nKapoor was criticised early in her career for being “plump” … and then deemed too “skinny” as a size zero in Tashan (2008). Whatever the criticism was, the 39-year-old actress is always one step ahead of her peers, knowing that her body size will still remain a hot topic even decades after the event.\n\nShe is calculative about her roles\n\nAs an actress Kapoor has reinvented herself by playing supporting roles and working alongside indie filmmakers; an exception for prominent Bollywood actresses. From playing a dancer bombshell in Don (2006), the bubbly Geet in Jab We Met (2007) to doctor Kalindi in Udta Punjab (2016), each role honed her acting chops and diversified her portfolio.\n\nShe dropped the diva attitude\n\nSimilar to her role as Pooja in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), the young Kareena Kapoor was once known for her prima donna attitude. However, after her marriage to Saif Ali Khan in 2012, Kapoor emerged as a mature working mother that many fans can relate to.\n\nShe flaunted her pregnancy bump\n\nWhether it was walking for Sabyasachi Mukherjee, posing in custom Gaurav Gupta for a Grazia cover, or shooting Veere Di Wedding six months into her pregnancy, the starlet showed her pregnancy bump to the world. Speaking to Hindustan Times, she said, “I’m a woman, and this is what God has made, and it’s such a beautiful thing. I’m not sure why no Bollywood actress has done this before!”\n\nShe is vocal about women’s issues\n\nDespite being one of the highest-paid actress in Bollywood, Kapoor has stated on numerous occasions that she is not getting paid as much as her male counterparts, raising the issues about pay parity. “I don't get a pay cheque as much as them. But I am going to fight for it, and hopefully one day we will get there,” as she told Gulf News.\n\nWant more stories like this? Sign up here.
