        "text": "Kareena Kapoor once disclosed the reasons behind everyone advising her against marrying Saif Ali Khan.\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with Filmfare, the 43-yea-old actress discussed her marriage to Saif after years of living together, reflecting on tying the knot \"at the peak of her career.\" and\n\nThe Jab We Met actress said at that time, \"I wasn’t edgy or anxious. But it’s a new journey. I started living in with Saif before I got married, not because I wanted to experiment or test.\"\n\n\"It was because we weren’t getting much time to spend with each other as we were shooting continuously. After that, it was a natural transition. He asked me to marry him and that was it.\"\n\nRemembering people's reactions to her choice, Kareena shared, \"Everyone was like, Don't marry, your career will be over. I said, only my career will end right, I won't die. I love this man (Saif). If living with him means that producers don’t want to work with me, so be it.\"\n\n\"Of course, after that, I’ve done some good films. Saif has also been extremely encouraging. I only get edgy when we don’t see each other for a long time.\"\n\nKareena and Saif tied the knot in Mumbai on October 16, 2012, following years of dating.\n\nThe couple is blessed with two sons, Taimur Ali Khan, born in 2016, and Jehangir Ali Khan, born in 2021."
