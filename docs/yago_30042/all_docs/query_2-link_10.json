        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan, who got married to Saif Ali Khan in 2012 in Mumbai, once opened up about her husband’s first marriage. Before dating Kareena, Saif was married to actor Amrita Singh. The couple parted ways in 2004.\n\nBack in 2008, during an interview with People magazine, Kareena said that she would 'always respect' Amrita. The actor also added that she has been a fan of Amrita Singh.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan on Saif Ali Khan's ex-wife\n\nWhile talking about Saif Ali Khan’s first marriage, Kareena had said, \"I respect the fact that Saif was married before and has two lovely children. I have been a fan of Amrita Singh. I haven't met her ever but I know her through her films. For me, she'll always have a place of importance in his life because she is Saif Ali Khan's first wife and the mother of his children. And, I've told Saif this.\"\n\nALSO READ: When Saif Ali Khan Wanted Kareena Kapoor To Play lead Instead Of Deepika Padukone In 'Love Aaj Kal'\n\nShe added, \"I would want her to have that kind of respect always. This is what my parents have taught me. At the end of the day, it was just a marriage that didn't work out. I have always encouraged Saif to be friends with her because I think that would be great. I guess they will just need time but that's something that they would need to deal with. I will always respect her. As far as any other relationship of Saif is concerned, I don't think they really mattered.\"\n\nAbout Kareena Kapoor\n\nAfter getting married on October 16, 2012, Kareena and Saif had two sons: Taimur Ali Khan, who was born in 2016, and Jehangir Ali Khan, also known as Jeh, who was born in 2021. Saif also has two children with his ex-wife Amrita: Ibrahim Ali Khan and Sara Ali Khan."
