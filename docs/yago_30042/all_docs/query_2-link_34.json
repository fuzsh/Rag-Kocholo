        "text": "New Delhi: Kareena Kapoor Khan's upcoming OTT debut in ‘Jaane Jaan’, with Jaideep Ahlawat and Vijay Varma, has made her the buzz of the town. Kareena is married to the dashing actor Saif Ali Khan, and the couple has two wonderful boys named Taimur and Jehangir. The actress recently spoke to a news publication about the criticism she's received since marrying Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan, despite the fact that they are from different faiths. Bebo also addressed the criticism she faced over the age difference between her and her spouse.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan has (sadly) experienced everything, from trolling to threats because of her interfaith marriage to her marriage to a man ten years older than her. She recently discussed the same during an event, Express Adda in Mumbai\n\nKareena and Saif's age difference of ten years has also been a point of criticism. Kareena told the publication, “When has age ever mattered? He is hotter than ever. I am happy I am 10 years younger; he should be worried. No one would say he has turned 53. Age does not matter... what matters is respect and love and the fact that we have fun with each other.”\n\nKareena Kapoor highlighted during the interview that people nowadays waste too much time and energy talking about interfaith relationships when they shouldn't.\n\nShe said, “We spend so much time discussing interfaith (relationships). So much energy, so much that they are 10 years apart. The important thing is to have fun. The most important thing between Saif and I is that we like each other and enjoy our company. How should it matter what faith he follows or what his age is that isn’t even a point of discussion.”\n\nKareena and Saif tied the knot in 2012 and have been happily together ever since."
