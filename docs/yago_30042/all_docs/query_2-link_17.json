        "text": "After a five-year relationship, when Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor finally decided to settle down, the celebrations were unmatched. Style, luxury and regal were the keywords of this high-profile wedding that had the shutterbugs on their toes. As their blissful union completes two years, we recall the magnificent moments from the big fat wedding that crossed religious and age boundaries. Let us unfurl the story of the Bollywood’s chotte Nawab and his Begum, Kareena Kapoor Khan.\n\nLove beyond the boundaries\n\nKareena was born in a Punjabi Hindu family to yesteryear actors Babita and Randhir Kapoor. Whereas, Saif spent his childhood in a Muslim atmosphere, being the son of Nawab Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore. Even though they both are following different faith and have different upbringing, their marriage broke the narrow prism of religion, culture and even age.\n\nThe couple decided to tie the knot with due respect to each other’s religious views. In the earlier marriages of the Pataudi family, women have converted into Islam to marry their significant other. Saif’s mother Sharmila did so too. But, Kareena was not up for any such religious conversion and her decision was backed by her beau. Apart from love, it seems tolerance and acceptance is the key reasons behind this beautiful inter-faith union.\n\nRecommended Read: 8 Bollywood Celebs who are Younger than their Wives\n\nJab they met\n\nSaif and Kareena’s love story led to a lot of tabloid fodder. Prince fell in love with princess Kapoor, on the sets of movie Tashan. Though their chemistry onscreen was not that powerful, but their real life love became quite fascinating for all. They started dating in October 2007 when Kareena-Shahid's relationship was at its bitter end. They had an instant attraction, and slowly and steadily fell in love.\n\nIf you want to know the secrets behind this beautiful Bollywood diva's figure, then Don't Miss: Secrets Behind The Stunning Figure of Kareena Kapoor\n\nTheir Wedding Hoopla\n\nFive years and numerous wedding speculations later, the two got married on October 16, 2012. This star-studded affair lasted for an entire week. Take a look:\n\nSangeet Evening\n\nThe wedding carnival of this power couple kick-started with a grand sangeet ceremony. The bride and the groom’s families and friends got together to celebrate the outset of a new bonding. The evening was marked with music, dance and masti. The terrace party was held at Kareena’s Bandra residence. Buddies Malaika Arora Khan, Amrita Arora, Shakeel Ladak and Tusshar Kapoor shimmied to well-choreographed moves by Karan Johar. There was an array of dance performances to popular Bollywood numbers dedicated to the lovely couple. The terrace venue was covered to prevent media getting a snoop.\n\nHere is a special video where you can see who all attended Kareena and Saif's sangeet ceremony, and who wore what?

A simple registered marriage took place at Saif’s residence.\n\nExchanging of Vows\n\nEarlier it was rumoured that the couple would go for a nikaah. But, on the D-day we got to see their secular outlook towards their marriage. They just exchanged vows at the Taj Mahal Hotel. There were no `saath pheras` and they did not follow any particular style of wedding. The marriage was more about breaking the stereotype. As we said before, Kareena did not change her religion after her marriage. She only went on to change her last name, and is now known as Kareena Kapoor Khan.\n\nRecommended Read: 8 Reasons Why You should have Sex Everyday\n\nAfter-wedding Dinner\n\nThe after-marriage bash was a vibrant affair.
