        "text": "Amrita Singh recently reminisced about returning to work for the sake of her children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan following her divorce from Saif Ali Khan.\n\nIn an old interview with Zoom TV, the 66-year-old actress candidly discussed her comeback to films, expressing her desire to shield her children from any negative impact.\n\nThe Betaab actress said, “I had to overcome everything I was going through very fast because I didn't want my children to grow up feeling that they were left with loser parent.\"\n\n\"That you know I just stayed at home and just mulled over my situation and you know just stayed fat and complacent and unhappy because of my circumstances. I didn't want my children to grow up learning to be you know defeated in life by a situation,\" Amrita added.\n\nDuring promotions for Ae Watan Mere Watan, Sara discussed her experience of living with a single mother in an interview with ETimes.\n\nShe revealed, “I think living with a single mother has a huge role to play in it. At a very early age, I realised nobody is going to do anything for you. It's not that I don't get help, I do.\"\n\n\"But ultimately, you are the mover and initiator of your life. If you are lucky, stars align and God wills, then it will happen. You can't be waiting around for things to happen, it doesn't work like that,\" Sara added.\n\nFor the unversed, Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan tied the knot in 1991 and parted ways in 2004."
