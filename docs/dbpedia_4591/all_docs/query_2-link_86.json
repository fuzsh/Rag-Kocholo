        "text": "Our senior academy, The Royal Society of Edinburgh, has today announced 91 newly-elected Fellows. They will be joining the RSE’s current Fellowship, which comprises 1,800 people who are recognised as being some of the greatest thinkers, researchers and practitioners in their field working in or with organisations in Scotland today.\n\nWe are delighted that three alumni of the Young Academy of Scotland are amoung them:\n\nDr Fiona McNeill, Reader in Computer Science Education, University of Edinburgh\n\nProfessor Harish Nair, Professor of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Global Health, University of Edinburgh\n\nMr Peter Reekie, Chief Executive, Scottish Futures Trust\n\nThese new Fellows join 39 other YAS members and alumni who have previously been welcomed into the RSE. While YAS members do not automatically become Fellows, the increasing number of YAS members and alumni in the RSE Fellowship is testament to the excellence, drive, and creativity of our members. To be appointed RSE Fellows, these individuals have undergone rigorous assessment of their achievements, professional standing and the contribution they and their work make to wider society.\n\nProfessor Sir John Ball, President of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, said: “It is a great privilege to welcome our new Fellows – they represent outstanding commitment and achievement at the highest level across a diverse range of sectors. From scientific advancement that changes lives to leading business innovation recognised across the world, the RSE welcomes the best minds to harness their unique insight and make knowledge useful for the greater good.”\n\nMore information on the all new Fellows, including the YAS members being inducted this year can be found on the RSE website."
