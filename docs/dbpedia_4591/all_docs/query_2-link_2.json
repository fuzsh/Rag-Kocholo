        "text": "91 Fellows have been elected to join The Royal Society of Edinburgh from across the sciences, education, the arts, business, and public life.\n\nAmong those joining are Olympian Dame Katherine Grainger; world record holder Mark Beaumont BEM; Cardiovascular specialist, Professor Lis Neubeck; former CEO of Wood Plc, Robin Watson CBE; and author Andrew O’Hagan.\n\nThe Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), Scotland’s National Academy, has announced its 2023 intake of Fellows, with 91 names representing science, arts, business, sports, civil society and academia from across Scotland and beyond.\n\nThey will be joining the RSE’s current Fellowship, which comprises 1,800 people recognised as being some of the greatest thinkers, researchers and practitioners in their field working in or with organisations in Scotland today.\n\nThis year, Dame Katherine Grainger DBE, Chair of UK Sport, receives the coveted Honorary Fellowship in recognition of her ability to engage and inspire people. Dame Katherine is one of Team GB’s most decorated athletes and the only female athlete – in any sport – to gain medals in five consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nShe also works with several charities helping young people to access the benefits of sport and physical activity. Alongside her stellar sporting achievements, Dame Katherine has achieved a PhD in criminal law, and in 2020 was the first woman to be appointed Chancellor of the University of Glasgow since it was founded in 1451.\n\nAlso joining the Fellowship this year is Andrew O’Hagan, the Scottish author whose 2020 novel, Mayflies, was recently adapted into a highly successful drama for BBC starring Martin Compston and Tony Curran.\n\nBorn in Glasgow and raised in Ayrshire, Mr. O’Hagan has had a decorated career, including three booker prize nominations. He won the Glenfiddich Writer of the Year Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and the E.M. Forster Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is currently Editor-at-Large of the London Review of Books, and is a contributor to Esquire, the New York Review of Books, and the New Yorker.\n\nOthers named as Fellows of the RSE this year include Mark Beaumont BEM, who holds the record for cycling round the world in less than 79 days. With a degree in economics and politics, Mr. Beaumont has spent 15 years working with a leading mid-market private equity firm and also became a partner at investment firm Eos Advisory in 2019. He was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to charity and sport in 2018.\n\nMr. Beaumont has already invested in Scottish innovation in science, engineering and technology, and his unique networks, passion for performance and skills in public engagement will make him an inspirational adviser and advocate for the RSE.\n\nProfessor Lis Neubeck, cardiac nurse and Head of Cardiovascular Health in the School of Health and Social Care at Edinburgh Napier University is another individual joining this year’s prestigious list of Fellows. Her research focuses on innovative solutions to secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the identification and management of atrial fibrillation, and use of new technologies to improve access to health care.\n\nHer work across the international healthcare community, from being an honorary professor at Sydney Nursing School, to past President of the Association of Cardiovascular Nurses and Allied Professionals of the European Society of Cardiology means she brings extensive experience of overseas collaboration to the RSE.\n\nRobin Watson CBE, former chief executive of Wood Plc, the Scottish multinational engineering and consultancy company, was also elected as a Fellow for his services to business.\n\nMr. Watson stepped down from his role at Wood Plc in 2022, where he spent 10 years on the board, seven of which as chief executive. He transformed the business into one of the world’s foremost engineering and consultancy companies, and was awarded his CBE in Her Majesty the Queen’s 2020 Birthday Honours, in recognition of services to international trade.\n\nHis track record of global business impact, passion for developing the Scottish economy, huge appetite for encouraging academic and business partnerships and the reputation and standing to positively influence make him an asset to the RSE network.\n\nThe full list of new Fellows 2023 are as follows:\n\nHonorary Fellow\n\nCorresponding Fellows\n\nFellows"
