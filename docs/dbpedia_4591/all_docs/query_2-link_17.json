        "text": "Scotland’s national academy, the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), has revealed its newly selected 2021 Fellows.\n\nThey will join the RSE’s current roll of around 1,600 leading thinkers and practitioners from Scotland and beyond.\n\nThis year’s cohort includes many who have made a positive impact during Covid-19, either as a result of their academic research or through their contribution to arts or for the role they have played in communicating complex information with the public.\n\nThose who are elected to the Fellowship have undergone a rigorous assessment of their achievements, professional standing and the contribution they and their work make to wider society.\n\nThe list includes many academics such as professor Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health and director of the global health governance programme at Edinburgh University, who has become something a household name in the last 12 months as a public health expert during the pandemic.\n\nAlso becoming a Fellow is Louise Macdonald, who has been instrumental in helping to shape Scotland’s future for young people through her work as chief executive at Young Scot, and was recently appointed as national director of Institute of Directors Scotland.\n\nFounding partner and executive chairman of law firm Harper Macleod, professor Lorne Crerar, has also been elected. He is an emeritus professor of banking law at University of Glasgow, author of the Crerar Review of public services, and the creator of the home report system.\n\nMacdonald said: \"I am honoured to have been selected as an RSE Fellow alongside so many remarkable people doing such extraordinary work here in Scotland and around the globe.\"\n\nCrerar added: “I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to the work of RSE which is so important particularly in these challenging times.”\n\nAlongside the 79 Ordinary Fellows, is Honorary Fellow Baroness Onora O'Neill of Bengarve - known for her work in political philosophy and ethics - and seven Corresponding Fellows from across the world, including Dr James Rautio, founder and president of Sonnet Software.\n\nDame Anne Glover, president of the RSE, said: “Through uniting these great minds from different walks of life, we can discover creative solutions to some of the most complex issues that Scotland faces.\n\n\"A warm welcome is extended to all of our new Fellows.”\n\nMost new Fellows are academics, but among the business leaders are: Anne Glover, co-founder and chief executive of Amadeus Capital Partners; Andrew Sloan, managing director at COWI UK; Judy Wagner, co-founder and director of FWB Park Brown; Ian Stevens, chief executive of Bsolve Dental; and Dr Poonam Malik, director at Scottish Enterprise.\n\nAll candidates for Fellowship must be nominated by an existing Fellow and supported by a further two.\n\nNominations then go through a five-stage selection process, to ensure that those elected are leading lights in their respective fields.\n\nThe over-riding requirement for selection is excellence, measured against three criteria: outstanding achievement, professional standing, and societal contribution.\n\nThe full list of new Fellows is below:\n\nSam Alberti, Keeper of Science and Technology, National Museums Scotland\n\nKaren Anderson, Architect and Founding Partner, Anderson Bell Christie\n\nMalcolm Appleby, Designer and Engraver\n\nClive Badman, Executive Director, Special Projects in Life Sciences, University of Strathclyde\n\nChristopher Barratt, Head of Division Post Graduate Medicine, University\n\nDerek Bell, Professor for Acute Medicine, Imperial College London\n\nKirstie Blair, Chair in English Studies, University of Strathclyde\n\nHelen Bond, Head of the School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh\n\nHolly Branigan, Head of School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh\n\nTara Brendle, Head of Mathematics, University of Glasgow\n\nIan Brown, Senior Honorary Research Fellow in Scottish Literature, University of Glasgow\n\nMalinda Carpenter, Professor of Developmental Psychology, University of St Andrews\n\nCalum Colvin, Professor of Fine Art Photography, University of Dundee\n\nLorne Crerar, Chairman, Harper MacLeod\n\nJames Curran, Chair, Climate Ready Clyde\n\nVincent Deighan, Comic Book Artist -
