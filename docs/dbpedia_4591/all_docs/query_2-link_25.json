She set up and now leads the UHI’s Institute for Northern Studies, a world-leading establishment combining research, teaching, and community engagement. She is also the first woman from UHI to be elected as a Fellow of the RSE.\n\nProfessor Heddle said: “I am delighted to be joining this august company of learned colleagues and am looking forward to many opportunities to share my expertise with the public.”\n\nVicki Nairn, UHI Principal and Vice-Chancellor, congratulated Donna: “Professor Heddle's selection is a testament to her remarkable contributions to research and her pioneering leadership at the Institute for Northern Studies and contributions to UHI. We are immensely proud of Donna and her achievements and look forward to her continued impact on academia and community engagement.”\n\nPresident of the RSE, Professor Sir John Ball PRSE, said: “It is an immense honour to extend a warm welcome to each of our distinguished new Fellows.”\n\n“Individually, they embody exceptional dedication and accomplishment spanning multiple sectors and disciplines. Collectively, they demonstrate a profound commitment and determination to make meaningful contributions through their endeavours.”\n\n“From groundbreaking research that redefines our understanding to the creative pursuits that inspire and enrich our cultural landscape, the RSE proudly embraces the brightest minds, leveraging their unique expertise and perspectives for the betterment of society.”\n\n“As Scotland’s National Academy, we remain committed to mobilising a diverse array of expertise to confront society's most pressing challenges, and I am certain that our new Fellows will prove invaluable assets to the RSE.”"
