She became a Chevening Scholar in 1999, studying Law at the University of Cambridge at a time when her country was recovering from conflict. Almost 25 years on, Mina reflects on how her aspirations for building a better world have changed over time, as well as the key learnings that have stayed with her from her Chevening year."
