        "text": "Published: 16/04/2021\n\nShare this story:\n\nThe Engineering Council would like to congratulate registrant Professor Graham Wren OBE CEng FRSE FIMechE FIET FREng on being elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), Scotland’s National Academy of Science and Letters. This honour recognises his work advancing engineering and science across both the business and public sectors for over 40 years.\n\nProfessor Wren has been a champion of engineering, leading many first of their kind projects in sectors ranging from forensic science to nuclear technology. He has also been the principal architect of some of the UK’s largest translational research centres, linking the needs of the engineering industry with world class research.\n\nOver the past 10 years at the University of Strathclyde, Professor Wren has driven innovative projects raising over £500M for industrial research in areas including renewable energy, aerospace, nuclear and pharmaceutical manufacturing. These include the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland and the Technology and Innovation Centre in Glasgow. He is also a Professor at the University of Technology in Australia.\n\nHe has served on over 30 company and research centre boards and offered his expertise to numerous government and international committees. Professor Wren is also a keen mentor – working with engineers at all levels, ranging from senior directors to young engineers, working with schools and charities and supporting the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme for over 15 years.\n\nIn 2021 the RSE has selected 87 new Fellows from across sciences, arts, education, business and public life. All nominations go through a five-stage selection process to ensure those elected demonstrate excellence through outstanding achievement, professional standing and societal contribution. This year’s intake of leading thinkers and practitioners join around 1,600 current Fellows, all individuals whose work has had a significant impact on Scotland.\n\nProfessor Dame Anne Glover, President of The Royal Society of Edinburgh said: “As Scotland’s national academy we recognise excellence across a diverse range of expertise and experience, and its effect on Scottish society… Through uniting these great minds from different walks of life, we can discover creative solutions to some of the most complex issues that Scotland faces. A warm welcome is extended to all of our new Fellows.”\n\nFor press enquiries:\n\nKate Webster, Engineering Council – kwebster@engc.org.uk, 020 3206 0567\n\nNotes for editors:\n\nThe Engineering Council holds the national Register of Engineering Technicians (EngTech), Incorporated Engineers (IEng), Chartered Engineers (CEng) and Information and Communication Technology Technicians (ICTTech). It also sets and maintains the internationally recognised standards of competence and ethics that govern the award and retention of these titles. By this means it is able to ensure that employers, government and wider society, both at home and overseas, can have confidence in the skills and commitment of registrants.
