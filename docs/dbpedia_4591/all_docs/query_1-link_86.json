        "text": "William Thomson was born in Belfast on 26 June 1824. He was the son of James Thomson, Professor of Mathematics at Glasgow University. He was educated at Glasgow University and Peterhouse College, Cambridge. In 1846 he became Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University, establishing his academic reputation in the field of thermodynamics. He put forward an absolute scale of temperature - known as the Kelvin scale - and formulated the laws of equivalence and of transformation. He also put forward the doctrine of available energy. Thomson was a practical scientist too, and worked on the development of electric telegraphy. In 1853 he put forward the theory of electric oscillations and then performed a number of experiments towards the creation of insulated electric telegraph cables. In 1856 he was a Director of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and in the same year that he invented the mirror galvanometer - 1865-1866 - he supervised the laying of the transatlantic cable from Ireland to Newfoundland. He was also involved in the French Atlantic cable in 1869, the Brazilian River Plate cable in 1873, West Indian cables in 1875, and the Mackay-Bennett Atlantic cable in 1879. Thomson also invented an improved mariner's compass, a navigational sounding machine, a tide predictor, and many electrical measuring and telegraphic instruments. He was knighted in 1866 for his work on telegraphy and was created Baron Kelvin of Largs in 1892. In 1902 Kelvin became a Member of the Order of Merit and a Privy Councillor. William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, died on 17 December 1907. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe local Indexes show other references to Lord Kelvin related material (check the Indexes for more details): letters to James Geikie and Sir Archibald Geikie, at Gen. 525; and, letter to Sir C. J. Pearson, Gen.756, no.136.\n\nIn the Indexes too there are many items that mention Lord Kelvin: letter of Sir C. W. Thomson to Lady Thomson, at Gen. 1733/94; items at Gen. 2169/64, 69-70, 97, 183-225; items at Gen. 1730-1732; letters from P. G. Tait at Dc.2.76/16, ff.21-27; letters of M. Forbes to Sir A. Geikie, and Alexander Buchan to Geikie at Gen. 1426/118-119; and, letters of Lorimer and Milne to Geikie at Gen. 1425/289, 333.\n\nIn addition, the UK National Register of Archives (NRA), updated by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, notes: correspondence and papers, Glasgow University Library, Special Collections Department, NRA 10032 Thomson, see Guide to Dept of Special Collections, 1989, and also lecture notes, 1849-1850, see Accessions to repositories 1969; business papers relating to patent compass, 1876-1918, Glasgow University Archive Services, Ref.
