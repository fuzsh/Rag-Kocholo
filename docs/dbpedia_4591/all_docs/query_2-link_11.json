        "text": "The Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), Scotland’s National Academy has announced its 2024 intake of 57 new Fellows from Scotland and beyond. They will be joining the RSE’s current Fellowship of around 1,800 Fellows, who are recognised as being some of the greatest thinkers, researchers and practitioners working in or with Scotland.\n\nElham Kashefi is Professor of Quantum Computing at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Director of the Edinburgh Quantum Software Lab and Directeur de recherche au CNRS at LIP6 Sorbonne Université. She co-founded the fields of quantum cloud computing and quantum computing verification and has pioneered a transdisciplinary interaction of hybrid quantum-classical solutions from theoretical investigation to actual experimental and industrial commercialisation. She is a Chief Scientist at the National Quantum Computing Centre.\n\nAmong a raft of achievements, she developed the world’s first method for secure cloud quantum computing. She called her election “a thrilling opportunity.”\n\nThis year’s cohort of new Fellows is nominated for their excellence in a wide range of fields such as physics, chemistry, informatics, literature, law, social sciences, and business. They will be joining the 1,800 current Fellows of the RSE, Scotland’s National Academy. New Fellows have been elected from institutions from across the UK, including Dundee, Aberdeen, St Andrews, Stirling, Highlands and Islands, and from countries around the world including the Netherlands, Germany, USA, and China."
