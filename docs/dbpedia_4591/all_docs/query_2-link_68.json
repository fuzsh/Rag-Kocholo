He helped to develop the template-directed protocols that could synthesise these interlocked molecules, like ‘rotaxanes’ and ‘catenanes’, in high yields. This, and similar, work established Sir Fraser as a pioneer in ‘artificial molecular machines’ –molecules that can undergo simple mechanical motion and thereby have the potential to do work on the smallest of scales! Sir Fraser has dubbed his approach ‘molecular meccano’.\n\nIn 2017 Sir Fraser joined UNSW, Sydney to realise his “New Chemistry” initiative. Visiting each year Fraser gives lectures to faculty and students and collaborates on a range of exciting chemistry projects involving the manipulation of molecules to effect devices such as switches, sensors and motors.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Sir Fraser has been awarded many prizes and fellowships including the Albert Einstein World Award of Science (2007), Davy Medal of the Royal Society (2008) and membership of the National Academy of Sciences (USA, 2014).\n\nNearly 300 PhD and post-doctoral researchers have been trained in Sir Fraser’s laboratories, and he is well known for mentoring young scientists.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nProfessor Jill Trewhella DistFRSN FAAAS FLANL\n\nProfessor Trewhella began her academic career after studying mathematics and physics at the University of NSW, where she also completed a masters degree in physics. Graduating with a doctorate in inorganic chemistry in 1980 from the University of Sydney, she accepted a post-doctoral position at Yale University, where she was appointed an associate research scientist in 1983, and in 1984, she was invited to join the Los Alamos National Laboratory to launch a biological neutron scattering program. She soon began using neutrons to study how nature regulates the activities of biological molecules. Her work gained her international recognition for her contribution to our understanding of the molecular communication that underpins healthy function. Professor Trewhella spent 20 years building multidisciplinary programs at Los Alamos where she was appointed Director of Bioscience in 2000. This work was recognised with her election as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and as an Australian Research Council Federation Fellow in 2004. She also gained the rare distinction of being elected Fellow of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nWith her Federation Fellowship, Professor Trewhella took up joint appointments as Professor of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Sydney and at the neutron scattering research facility, the Bragg Institute, south of Sydney. From 2009 to 2015, Professor Trewhella was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at the University of Sydney, balancing her research with her responsibility for the University’s research strategy and ensuring quality research infrastructure and professional services to support that strategy. In 2015 Jill was awarded the Tage Erlander Visiting Professorship by the Swedish Research Council and for the next three years she divided her time between the US, Australia and Sweden. While in Sweden she worked with Swedish researchers to help build expertise in structural biology with a focus on taking advantage of major research infrastructure investments in the form of the MAXIV synchrotron and the European Spallation Source, both based in Lund.\n\nSince 2020, Jill has been in the US as COVID travel restrictions and family priorities dictated. With an Adjunct Professorship in Chemistry at the University of Utah and as Professor Emerita at Sydney, she continues working with the international structural biology community to establish standards and validation protocols for the publication of the results of integrative structural biology, where structures are determined using multiple types of experimental data and computational methods.\n\nProfessor Trewhella originally set out to train as a high school teacher, but she never dreamed that one day her career path would bring her into contact with a US President. Her decision to accept an invitation to enrol in an honours physics program at the University of NSW later resulted in her advising George W. Bush on available technologies to defend against bio-terrorism.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nProfessor Bruce Warren OAM DistFRSN FRCPath\n\nBruce Albert Warren is a distinguished pathologist who has reached the highest levels of medical research through academic achievement, university management and publication activity.
