        "text": "More than 60 exceptional scientists from around the world have been elected as Fellows and Foreign Members of the Royal Society. The 51 new Fellows, 10 Foreign Members and one Honorary Fellow have been selected for their outstanding contributions to scientific understanding. With discoveries ranging from the first planets outside our solar system, to the creation of the world’s smallest molecular engine, new mathematical proofs and treatments for debilitating global disease. They embody the global nature of science, with representation from Sweden, Israel, Germany, Australia, Canada, UK-born scientists working in Europe and beyond, and researchers from around the world enriching Britain’s own research and innovation sector. Their ranks include six Nobel laureates, as well as internationally recognised leaders in industry and science policy.\n\nVenki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, said:\n\n'At this time of global crisis, the importance of scientific thinking, and the medicines, technologies and insights it delivers, has never been clearer. Our Fellows and Foreign Members are central to the mission of the Royal Society, to use science for the benefit of humanity.\n\n'While election to the Fellowship is a recognition of exceptional individual contributions to the sciences, it is also a network of expertise that can be drawn on to address issues of societal, and global significance. This year’s Fellows and Foreign Members have helped shape the 21st century through their work at the cutting-edge of fields from human genomics, to climate science and machine learning.\n\n'It gives me great pleasure to celebrate these achievements, and those yet to come, and welcome them into the ranks of the Royal Society.'\n\nAmong this year’s Fellows and Foreign Members:\n\nFrancis Collins becomes a Foreign Member for his contributions to human genetics over four decades, including identifying the genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis and leading the landmark Human Genome Project. John Shine joins as a Fellow for his leading role in the development of gene cloning technology, including the first cloned human gene and the development of gene expression tools critical to the biotechnology industry.\n\nDonna Strickland is honoured as a Fellow for her co-invention of Chirped Pulse Amplification. This revolution in laser science has led to advances in fields as diverse as astrophysics, surgery and nuclear fusion research, and saw her share the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. Henry Chapman becomes a Fellow for breakthroughs in the field of lensless imaging. By pulsing radiation to limit its damaging effects, he made atomic-scale ‘movies’ of the cell’s molecular machinery in action a reality. Pioneering crystallographer Ada Yonath is elected as a Foreign Member for her part in unravelling the structure of the ribosome – the cellular assembly line that turns DNA into proteins – which also saw her share in the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nFor his contributions to global child health, Zulfiqar Bhutta becomes a Fellow. Working with public health sector workers in Pakistan he has led more than a dozen large cluster randomised trials into maternal, newborn and child health. William Campbell is recognised for his part in developing drugs for devastating parasitic diseases. He shared in the 2015 Nobel in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of ivermectin, which has helped virtually eliminate river blindness across large parts of the world.\n\nAs one of the founding fathers of deep learning, Yoshua Bengio is honoured this year. His work on neural networks and machine translation helped bring about the AI revolution transforming the 21st century. Stephen Young joins the list for pioneering the statistical approach to language processing – namely, treating conversation as a reinforcement learning problem – that made the speech-recognition products in millions of homes a reality.\n\nMargaret Kivelson becomes a Foreign Member for her work in shaping our understanding of the magnetic fields of Earth, Jupiter and Saturn, and revealing subsurface oceans on Ganymede and Europa. Didier Queloz joins the Fellowship for his part in the discovery of the first planet beyond our solar system, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics last year. Hundreds more exoplanets have since been revealed by his pioneering observational techniques. Stephen Smartt is honoured for his pioneering use of digital sky surveying, enabling the detection of stars before they explode, and the discovery of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source.\n\nFor her trailblazing development of directed evolution, Frances Arnold is elected a Foreign Member. Her techniques to improve on existing enzyme or protein function led to more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly products, and earned her the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In recognition of his work in molecular nanoscience Ben Feringa also joins as a Foreign Member. His discovery of the light-driven rotary molecular motor made the first moving ‘nanocar’ and more complex nanomachines a reality, with applications in dozens of fields.\n\nMolly Stevens is honoured for ground-breaking advances in the engineering of bio-inspired materials for regenerative medicine and biosensing. She has been adept at translating her research from lab bench to industrial use and is currently applying her work to improving diagnostics for COVID-19. Materials engineer Vikram Deshpande becomes a Fellow for his seminal contributions in microstructural mechanics. His works include developing ‘metallic wood’, sheets of nickel as strong as titanium, but four-times lighter thanks to their plant-like nanoscale pores.\n\nFor opening the world’s eyes to the scale of the plastic waste pollution crisis, Richard Thompson becomes a Fellow. He coined the term microplastics in 2004, and his work to identify the sources and effects of microplastic has shaped environmental policy. Also honoured is Oliver Phillips for his work on Earth’s tropical forests. His methods revealed the extent that these ecosystems are affected by global climate processes, and how they could fuel further change in future.\n\nMathematician Jack Thorne is recognised for multiple breakthroughs in diverse areas of algebraic number theory. At age 32, he becomes the youngest living member of the Fellowship. While Wendelin Werner becomes a Foreign Member for revolutionising our understanding of two-dimensional models in probability and physics and achievements in random geometry, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 2006.\n\nRalf Speth is elected a Fellow for his advocacy for UK R&D as CEO of Jaguar Land Rover, and for his commitment to STEM education. Sir David Cooksey becomes an Honorary Fellow for helping cement the UK’s place as a global life sciences leader. As a governor of the Wellcome Trust he helped lobby for the Joint Infrastructure Fund to revitalise the UK’s out-of-date research infrastructure. He was instrumental in establishing the Francis Crick Institute, which he chaired for nine years.\n\nSome statistics about this year’s intake are as follows:\n\n14 of this year’s intake of Fellows (9) and Foreign Members (5) are women – this is 22.6% of the 2020 intake\n\nNew Fellows have been elected from institutions across the UK, (Exeter, Plymouth, Nottingham, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh, Sussex, Belfast, London, Oxford, Cambridge), the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia) and around the world (Germany, the Netherlands, Israel, the US)\n\nSix of this year’s intake (three men and three women) have received a Nobel Prize. Three in Chemistry, two in Physics, one in Medicine or Physiology\n\nPast Fellows and Foreign Members of the Royal Society have included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Dorothy Hodgkin and Stephen Hawking.\n\nThe full list of newly elected Fellows and Foreign Members:\n\nNew Fellows 2020\n\nProfessor Timothy Behrens FRS\n\nProfessor of Computational Neuroscience, Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford and Honorary Principal Investigator, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London\n\nProfessor Yoshua Bengio OC FRS\n\nFull Professor, Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, Université de Montréal, Canada\n\nProfessor Malcolm Bennett FRS\n\nProfessor of Plant Science, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham\n\nProfessor Ben Berks FRS\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford\n\nProfessor Zulfiqar Bhutta FRS\n\nRobert Harding Inaugural Chair in Global Child Health & Policy, Centre for Global Child Health, Toronto and Distinguished University Professor and Founding Director, Institute for Global Health & Development, Aga Khan University, South-Central Asia, East Africa and United Kingdom\n\nProfessor Kevin Brindle FMedSci FRS\n\nProfessor, Department of Biochemistry and Senior Group Leader, Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge\n\nProfessor Gordon Brown FMedSci FRS\n\nProfessor in Immunology, MRC Centre for Medical Mycology, University of Exeter\n\nProfessor William Campbell FRS\n\nEmeritus Fellow, Drew University (New Jersey), United States\n\nProfessor Henry Chapman FRS\n\nDirector, Centre for Free-Electron Laser Science, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and Universität Hamburg, Germany\n\nDr G.
