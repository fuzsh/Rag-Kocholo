        "text": "Are active in their area of work and will be able to evidence a contribution across the three dimensions of excellence: outstanding achievement, professional standing and societal contribution\n\nAre resident in the UK with a clear, continuing connection to Scotland related to their expertise\n\nAre requested to pay a joining fee and annual subscriptions. However, RSE does not wish anyone to be excluded from the Fellowship due to financial barriers therefore there is an option for case-by-case support\n\nOn average between 50 Fellows are elected every year.\n\nAre resident outside the UK\n\nUsually have some demonstrable interest in, or connection to, Scotland\n\nAre expected to engage in some way with the RSE â€“ For example the RSE may approach Corresponding Fellows for their views on consultative questions with an international dimension\n\nElection is intended to be honorific, without subscription\n\nAre not eligible to hold office or to vote at any meeting of the RSE\n\nMay take on the rights of a Fellow upon becoming a permanent resident in the UK and subject to RSE Council approval\n\nElections per year are limited to ten.\n\nAre members of the Royal House or other individuals of truly exceptional distinction. They should be internationally renowned and are likely to be widely known outside their specialism\n\nMay be of any nationality or country of residence but should usually have some demonstrable interest in, or connection to, Scotland\n\nElection is intended to be honorific, without subscription\n\nAre not required to take an active part in the work of the RSE, although they are welcome, and indeed encouraged, to do so\n\nMaximum of four Honorary Fellows may be elected in any one year, excluding members of the Royal House. The distinction expected for this category of Fellowship means that only in exceptional circumstances would the RSE elect four Honorary Fellows in the same year."
