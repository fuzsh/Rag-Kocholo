        "text": "The Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs series was published 1907-1966. It included 42 numbers, of which 18 were unique, and 24 were co-published as numbers within The Treasury of Human Inheritance series. Nearly all Pearson-era Memoirs reported on research undertaken either by Pearson or by GLNE employees. David Heron was Francis Galton Fellow in National Eugenics. Ethel M. Elderton was Francis Galton Scholar. Amy Barrington was Computer. Edgar Schuster was the first Francis Galton Fellow in Eugenics Laboratory’s predecessor, the Eugenics Record Office.\n\nEugenics Laboratory Memoirs series\n\nSchuster, Edgar and Elderton, Ethel Mary. 1907. The Inheritance of Ability: Being a Statistical Study of the Oxford Class Lists and of the School Lists of Harrow and Charterhouse (London: Dulau and Co.). 42 pp. Includes an appendix by Karl Pearson, ‘Influence of Academic Selection on Correlation Coefficients’, pp. 41–42. Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs 1.\n\nHeron, David. 1907. A First Study of the Statistics of Insanity and the Inheritance of the Insane Diathesis (London: Dulau and Co.).

A First Study of the Inheritance of Vision and of the Relative Influence of Heredity and Environment on Sight (London: Dulau and Co.). Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs 5.\n\nPearson, Karl (ed.). 1909. Treasury of Human Inheritance. Parts I and II (double part, ‘Pedigrees of physical, psychical, and pathological characters in Man’): Prefatory Note by Francis Galton; Preface by Karl Pearson; ‘Diabetes insipidus’ (by W.

On the Relationship of the Condition of the Teeth in Children to Factors of Health and Home Environment (London: Cambridge University Press). 80 pp. Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs 7.\n\nPrefatory Note by Karl Pearson, pp. v–vi. This project was undertaken by Rhodes in 1911–12, and Pearson’s preface stresses the value of slow project development. Memoir 7 is frequently recorded wrongly. This is because Pearson advertised a different publication as Memoir 7 ‘shortly’ to appear in endpapers from 1910 (i.e. Memoir 8) through 1920 (i.e. Lecture 12). That missing publication was Ethel Mary Elderton (1909) ‘The Influence of Parental Occupation and Home Conditions on the Physique of the Offspring’. This was not published as such, but elements were published as Memoir 10.\n\nHeron, David. 1910.

England, North of the Humber (London: Dulau and Co.). 246 pp. Eugenics Laboratory Memoirs 19-20.\n\nNo masthead on this publication. Number 19 in the series is advertised in some endpapers as ‘A First Report on the Condition of the People from the Standpoint of National Eugenics’.
