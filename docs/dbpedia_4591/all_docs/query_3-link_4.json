        "text": "What's it like to work at the Royal Society?\n\nThe Royal Society is the independent scientific academy of the UK. Our aim is to recognise, promote and support excellence in science, and to encourage the development and use of science for the benefit of humanity.\n\nWe have a wide range of roles and are based in one location overlooking St James’s Park and near Green Park, Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square.\n\nLearn\n\nThe Society wants to ensure every member of staff has the right opportunities to learn and develop their knowledge and skills. This can take many forms such as coaching, leadership training, upskilling, and mentoring. Staff can also apply for a financial bursary to pursue a further education course or a professional qualification.\n\nMove forward\n\nLearning and development are a part of moving forward in your career. If you work at the Society, you’ll find the support and encouragement to develop yourself with a view to progressing your career. All career opportunities are openly advertised across the organisation and staff from other teams and grades are encouraged to apply.\n\nRecognition and reward\n\nOur staff are high performing and produce amazing work. Every so often staff go the ‘extra mile’ perhaps by running or participating in a project, creating or following through an idea, or suggesting new ways to improve our efficiency. To recognise this extra effort and celebrate success, the Society runs a performance based one-off bonus scheme. In addition, a pay review takes place annually and the Society uses a wide variety of benchmarking processes to remain competitive. We work hard to provide a full range of staff benefits and these can be found on the Vacancies page.\n\nFlexibility\n\nThe importance of a balance between work and private life is recognised here and put into action. Staff work within core hours and can have flexible start and finish times. Eligible employees can request and apply for flexible working arrangements. The Society has adopted a hybrid flexible approach to working. This means most staff are contracted to work in the office with the option to work remotely some of the time.\n\nHealth\n\nStaff health and wellbeing are a priority at the Society. Organised by staff, there is yoga and football on offer while the staff portal offers advice on wellbeing, cooking, sleep and restoration. Mental health is as equally important as physical health with personal and confidential support such as the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) and our onsite Mental Health First Aiders.\n\nFun\n\nOur staff are a great group of friendly people who organise fun events in the office such as video game sessions, board games, book clubs and movie nights. Everyone is welcome."
