        "text": "Two University of Strathclyde Professors have been named Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE).\n\nProfessor Craig Clark MBE, Professor of Practice for Space at the University, and Professor Elisa Morgera, Director of the Strathclyde-led One Ocean Hub, are among the 91 new Fellows announced by the RSE.\n\nThe Fellowships recognise achievement in science, arts, business, sports, civil society and academia from across Scotland and beyond.\n\nProfessor Clark is renowned for his pioneering work on commercialising small satellites, in particular CubeSats. He founded Clyde Space Ltd, Glasgow’s first space company, in 2005; the company produced UKube-1, Scotland’s first satellite, which was launched in July 2014, and received a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in 2017.\n\nProfessor Clark was named an MBE in 2013 for services to Technology and Innovation. He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and an Inductee to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.\n\nProfessor Clark said: “The space sector is one of the fastest growing industry sectors in Scotland and I aim to engage within the Royal Society to ensure its continued growth and success. Personally, being named Fellow is an honour beyond anything I had thought possible and I am humbled to be named amongst this network of such prestigious individuals.”\n\nProfessor Morgera is Professor of Global Environmental Law and a member of the Strathclyde Centre for Environmental Law and Governance (SCELG). She specialises in international, European and comparative environmental law, with a particular focus on the interaction between biodiversity law and human rights, equity and sustainability in natural resource development, oceans governance, and corporate accountability. She has also researched the environmental dimensions of the external relations of the European Union.\n\nAs Director of the One Ocean Hub, Professor Morgera leads a global inter-disciplinary research collaboration of research institutions in the UK, Africa, South Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as UN agencies and other international partners. The One Ocean Hub is pioneering research on human rights and the marine environment with a view to better connecting marine and social sciences, and the arts, to support fair and inclusive decision-making for a healthy ocean whereby people and planet flourish.\n\nA key priority of the Hub is to ensure the knowledge, experiences and rights of those most-reliant upon the oceans, and disproportionately affected by our failure to protect them, are recognised.\n\nProfessor Morgera said: “I look forward to exchanging insights and practices with other Fellows, and further exploring with them if some of the One Ocean Hub innovations can be of interest beyond the realms of ocean governance.”\n\nA number of alumni have also been named new Fellows, including: author Andrew O’Hagan; Dr Stephen Breslin, CEO of Glasgow Science Centre; Sarah Jardine, CEO of medical diagnostic imaging centre epipole and former Chief Operating Officer of the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland; Sharon Cowan, Professor of Feminist and Queer Legal Studies, University of Edinburgh; Alison Culpan, Scotland Director of the Association of the British Pharmeceutical Industry; Uzma Khan, Vice-Principal Economic Development & Innovation, University of Glasgow; Amina Shah, National Librarian and CEO National Library of Scotland; Robin Watson, former CEO of Wood Plc and Strathclyde Executive Leadership Awardee; former Fraser of Allander Institute Director Professor Graeme Roy, former Fraser of Allander Institute Director, Professor MNV Ravi Kumar, formerly of Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, who has been named a corresponding Fellow.\n\nRSE President Professor Sir John Ball said: “It is a great privilege to welcome our new Fellows – they represent outstanding commitment and achievement at the highest level across a diverse range of sectors. From scientific advancement that changes lives to leading business innovation recognised across the world, the RSE welcomes the best minds to harness their unique insight and make knowledge useful for the greater good.\n\n“Harnessing our Fellows’ talents and ideas allows us to mobilise a wide range of expertise to tackle some of the most complex challenges society faces. In welcoming our new Fellows, I look forward to seeing the positive effect they will have on society in Scotland and beyond.”"
