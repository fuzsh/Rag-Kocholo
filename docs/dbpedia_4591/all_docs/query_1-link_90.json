He acsended to the respective thrones of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth Realms following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. He has held the title of Prince of Wales since 1958, and is styled HRH The Prince of Wales, except in Scotland, where he is styled HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and (unofficially) in Cornwall, where he is known as \"The Duke of Cornwall\". Constitutionally, he is the first in line to the throne, but third in order of precedence, following his parents.\n\nThe Prince of Wales is well-known for his extensive charity work, particularly for the Prince's Trust. He also carries out a full schedule of royal duties and, increasingly, is taking on more royal roles from his ageing parents. The Prince is also well known for his marriages to the late Diana, Princess of Wales and, subsequently, to Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nBirth[]\n\nCharles III was born on 14 November 1948 at Buckingham Palace. His father is The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, eldest son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. At the time of his birth, his mother was The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, the elder daughter of King George VI and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon and his father was The Duke of Edinburgh (having not yet been created a Prince of the United Kingdom). His mother was Heiress Presumptive to the British throne at the time of the Prince's birth. The Prince was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 15 December 1948 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Geoffrey Fisher and his godparents were: King George VI, Queen Mary, Princess Margaret, the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven, Hon. David Bowes-Lyon, Lady Brabourne, King Haakon VII of Norway (for whom the Earl of Athlone stood proxy) and Prince George of Greece (for whom Prince Philip stood proxy).\n\nUnder letters patent issued by the Prince's great grandfather, King George V, the title of a British prince and the style His Royal Highness was only available to the children and grandchildren in the male-line of the sovereign and the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. As Charles was a female-line grandchild of the sovereign, he would have taken his title from his father, The Duke of Edinburgh, and would have been styled by courtesy as Earl of Merioneth. However the title of Prince and Princess, with the style HRH was granted to all the children of Princess Elizabeth by new letters patent issued by King George VI. In this way the children of the heiress presumptive had a royal and princely status not thought necessary for the children of King George VI's other daughter, Princess Margaret. Thus from birth Charles was known as His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Edinburgh. Template:Infobox hrhstyles\n\nEarly life[]\n\nIn 1952, his mother assumed the throne, becoming Queen Elizabeth II. Prince Charles immediately became Duke of Cornwall under a charter of King Edward III, which gave that title to the Sovereign's eldest son, and was then referred to as HRH The Duke of Cornwall. He also became, in the Scottish Peerage, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick and Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.\n\nThe Duke of Cornwall was now the heir apparent to the throne. He attended his mother’s coronation at Westminster Abbey, sitting with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and his aunt, The Princess Margaret.\n\nEducation[]\n\nTemplate:British Royal Family\n\nSchool[]\n\nAs with royal children before him, a governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed to look after the Prince. The governess was responsible for educating the Prince between the ages of 5 and 8. In a break with tradition, Buckingham Palace announced in 1955, that the Prince would attend school, rather than have a private tutor, the first heir apparent to do so. He first attended Hill House School in West London, and later the Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire which the Duke of Edinburgh also attended.\n\nThe Prince finished his education at Gordonstoun, a private boarding school in the north east of Scotland. His father, the Duke of Edinburgh, had previously attended Gordonstoun, becoming head boy. It is often reported that the Prince despised his time at the school, where he was a frequent target for bullies. (\"Colditz in kilts\" he reportedly said.) The Prince would later send his own children to Eton College rather than Gordonstoun.\n\nIn 1966 Charles spent two terms at Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a history trip with his tutor Michael Collins Persse. On his return to Gordonstoun he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming Head Boy. In 1967 he left Gordonstoun with two A levels, in history and French.\n\nUniversity[]\n\nTraditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school. However, in a break with tradition, Charles attended university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, earning a 2:2 (lower second class degree). Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree. He also attended the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he went specifically in order to learn the Welsh language—the first English-born Prince (of Wales) ever to make a serious attempt to do so.\n\nCreated Prince of Wales[]\n\nHe was created The Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in 1958, though his actual investiture did not take place until 1 July 1969. This was a major ceremony, held at Caernarfon Castle in north Wales, a place traditionally associated with the creation of the title in the 13th century. Previous investitures had taken place at various locations, including the Palace of Westminster, the seat of Parliament. The Welsh borough of Swansea was granted city status to mark the occasion.\n\nThe investiture also aroused considerable hostility among some Welsh nationalists, and there were threats of violence and a short bombing campaign, although these acts were generally more related to the greater nationalist campaign for Welsh independence and the rights of the Welsh language. The nationalist campaign against the investiture culminated with an attempted bombing by two members of the Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru on the eve of the investiture that resulted in the two bombers' deaths.\n\nIn the late 1970s, The Prince of Wales established another first when he became the first member of the royal family since King George I to attend a British cabinet meeting, being invited to attend by Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan so as to see the workings of cabinet government at firsthand.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Charles privately expressed an interest in becoming Governor-General of Australia. By this time, however, Australian opinion had shifted firmly behind the view that the Governor-General should be an Australian, and nothing came of the proposal.[2]\n\nIf he ascends to the British throne after 20 September 2013, the Prince, who turned 58 in November 2006, would become the oldest successor to do so. Only William IV and Edward VII were older than Charles is now when they became the monarch of the United Kingdom.\n\nRomances[]\n\nThe Prince of Wales's love life has always been the subject of speculation and press fodder. He has been linked to a number of women including Georgiana Russell (daughter of the British Ambassador to Spain), Lady Jane Wellesley (daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington), Davina Sheffield, Penthouse model Fiona Watson, actress Susan George, Lady Sarah Spencer, Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg, The Lady Tryon (wife of the 3rd Baron Tryon), and divorcée Jane Ward, among others. Yet, none of them were ever considered marriage material, Template:Dubious with Princess Marie-Astrid barred from marriage to a member of the British Royal Family under British law due to her Roman Catholicism.\n\nAs heir-apparent to the Throne, the Prince of Wales had to choose a bride who was both a virgin and a Protestant (ideally, a member of the Church of England) who had an impeccable background in terms of both lineage and comportment. Reportedly, it was Camilla Shand, later his second wife, who helped him select 19-year-old nursery assistant Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer and younger sister of Lady Sarah Spencer. Buckingham Palace announced their engagement on 24 February 1981.\n\nFirst Marriage[]\n\nOn 29 July 1981, The Prince of Wales and Lady Diana were married at St Paul's Cathedral before 3,500 invited guests and an estimated 750 million people around the world. All of Europe's crowned heads attended (except for Juan Carlos I of Spain, who was advised not to attend because the couple's honeymoon would involve a stop-over in the disputed territory of Gibraltar). So, too, did most of Europe's elected heads of state, with the notable exceptions of President of Greece Constantine Karamanlis, who declined to go because Greece's exiled King, Constantine II, a personal friend of the Prince, had been described in his invitation as \"King of the Hellenes\"[3] and the President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery, who was advised by taoiseach Charles Haughey, not to attend because of Britain's continued presence in Northern Ireland.[4]\n\nBy marriage to the heir apparent, Lady Diana received both a title (the Princess of Wales) and the style of \"Her Royal Highness\". She was popularly known as Princess Diana, although her correct title was, until the couple's divorce, Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales. The couple made their home at Highgrove, near Tetbury in Gloucestershire and at Kensington Palace. Almost immediately, the Princess of Wales became a star attraction, chased by the paparazzi, her every move (including every change in hairstyle) closely followed by millions.\n\nHowever, the marriage soon became troubled. Critics of the Princess of Wales alleged that she was unstable and temperamental; one by one she sacked each of the Prince of Wales's longstanding staff members and fell out with numerous friends and members of her family (her father, her mother, her brother, The Duchess of York). Many of her own staff were reported to have left as well. The Prince of Wales, too, was blamed for the marital troubles, continuing his adulterous affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles, even hosting evenings at Highgrove with her as hostess, and refusing to treat Diana as an equal. Within five years of the wedding the fairytale marriage was already on the brink of collapse. Ironically, the Prince and Princess of Wales were similar in some respects: both had had troubled childhoods, both took their public roles seriously and devoted much of their time to charity work, becoming highly regarded for it. (The Princess of Wales notably devoted much time to helping AIDS sufferers, while The Prince of Wales devoted much effort to marginalised groups in urban centres through The Prince's Trust charity and to victims of mines).\n\nThough they remained publicly a couple, they had effectively separated by the late 1980s, he living in Highgrove, she in Kensington Palace. The media noted their increasing periods apart and their obvious discomfort at being in each other's presence. Evidence and recriminations of infidelity aired in the news media. By 1992, it was obvious that the marriage was over in all but name. The couple formally separated, with media sources taking different sides in what became known as the War of the Waleses.\n\nThe marriage of The Prince and Princess of Wales formally ended in divorce on 28 August 1996. It had produced two sons, Prince William of Wales, and Prince Henry of Wales who is known as Harry.\n\nDeath of Diana, Princess of Wales[]\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales was killed in a car accident while being chased by paparazzi in Paris in 1997. The Prince of Wales was praised by some for his handling of the events and their aftermath, in particular his over-ruling of palace protocol experts (and indeed the Queen) who argued that as Diana, Princess of Wales was no longer a member of the Royal Family, the responsibility for her funeral arrangements belonged to her blood relatives, the Spencers. The Prince of Wales, against advice, flew to Paris to accompany his ex-wife's body home and insisted that she be given a formal royal funeral; a new category of formal funeral was specially created for her.\n\nThe role of a single father earned much sympathy, in particular in the way the Prince handled a crisis when it was revealed that his younger son, Prince Harry, was using illegal drugs.\n\nRelationship with Camilla Parker Bowles[]\n\nDuring a 1994 television interview Charles admitted that he had committed adultery \"once it was clear the marriage had broken down\". It was later confirmed that the third party was Camilla, ending years of speculation. In fact in 1993, the British tabloids got hold of tapes (still unexplained) of a 1989 mobile telephone conversation allegedly between Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles, in which Prince Charles expressed regret for all the indignities she endured because of their relationship.\n\nAfter his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales, The Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles eventually became openly acknowledged, and she became his unofficial consort. With the death of Diana in 1997, Camilla's gradual emergence in the public eye came to a temporary halt. However, in 1999, after a party celebrating the 50th birthday of Camilla's sister Annabel Elliott, Charles and Camilla were photographed in public together. Many saw this as a sign that their relationship was now regarded as \"official\". In a further effort to gain acceptance of the relationship, in June 2000 Camilla met the Queen. Eventually in 2003, Camilla moved into Charles' homes at Highgrove and Clarence House, although Buckingham Palace points out that public funds were not used in the decoration of her suites.\n\nMarriage remained elusive, with two main issues requiring resolution and acceptance. As future Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the prospect of his marrying Mrs Parker Bowles, with whom he had had a relationship while both were married, was seen as controversial by some. Both the Prince and Camilla had divorced their spouses, but as her former husband was still alive (although re-married to his long-time mistress), her remarriage was likely to be problematic. Over time, opinion—both public and within the Church—shifted somewhat to a point where a civil marriage would be acceptable.\n\nSecond marriage[]\n\nTemplate:Seealso On 10 February 2005, it was announced by Clarence House [1] that the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles would marry on 8 April of that year, in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at the castle's St George's Chapel. Subsequently, the location was changed to the Guildhall in Windsor, possibly because of the discovery that Windsor Castle might have to become available for other people's weddings, should theirs be performed there. On Monday 4 April, it was announced that the wedding would be delayed for one day to 9 April to allow the Prince of Wales and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.\n\nIt was announced that, after the marriage, as the wife of the Prince of Wales, Mrs Parker Bowles would be styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and that upon the Prince's accession to the throne, she would not be known as Queen Camilla but as Her Royal Highness The Princess Consort. This form of address is believed to be based on that used by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert, who was styled as Prince Consort.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall spent their first wedding anniversary in Scotland. In Scotland they are styled the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay.\n\nPersonal interests[]\n\nThe Prince of Wales has a wide array of interests and activities, some of which have not been fully appreciated by the public. His popularity has fluctuated,[citation needed] but he is one of the most active Princes of Wales for centuries,[citation needed] and has devoted his time and effort to charity work and working with local communities. He is President of 16 charities, and raised over £100 million for charity in 2004. From February 1976 until December 1976 he served in the Royal Navy, commanding HMS Bronington, a minehunter. He is a watercolour artist and a published writer. He has exhibited and sold a number of paintings. The Prince's Trust, which he founded, is a charity that works mainly with young people, offering loans to groups, businesses and people (often in deprived areas) who had difficulty receiving outside support. Fundraising concerts are regularly held for the Prince's Trust, with leading pop, rock, and classical musicians taking part. The Prince grows and promotes organic food, although he drew some ridicule when he joked about sometimes talking to his houseplants[citation needed]. He is co-author, with Charles Clover, environment editor of the Daily Telegraph (London), of Highgrove: An Experiment in Organic Gardening and Farming, published by Simon & Schuster in 1993. The Prince is also regarded by some as an effective advocate for the United Kingdom. On a visit to the Republic of Ireland, for example, he delivered a personally researched and written speech on Anglo-Irish affairs which was warmly received by Irish politicians and the media.\n\nArchitecture[]\n\nHe has not been shy about sharing his views about the built environment in public forums. In essence, these views might be thought of as being part of the intellectual tradition of English town planning that descends from Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin.[citation needed] The Prince claims to \"care deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life\" and is known for being an advocate of the neo-traditional ideas of architects such as Christopher Alexander and Leon Krier. In 1984 he delivered a blistering attack on the profession of architecture in a speech given to the Royal Institute of British Architects. Despite criticism from the mainstream architectural press, he has continued to put forward his views on traditional urbanism, human scale and green design in numerous speeches and articles.\n\nTo put his ideas on architecture and town planning into practice, the Prince of Wales is developing the village of Poundbury in Dorset which is built from a master plan by Krier. Prior to commencing work on Poundbury he had published a book and produced a documentary entitled A Vision for Britain, both being a critique of modern architecture. In 1992 he also established The Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture and began the publication of a magazine dealing with architecture, but the latter has since ceased independent operation after being merged with another charity to create The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment in 2001. In November 2005, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, visited the United States. Besides visiting Washington D.C. and President George W. Bush, the Prince and Duchess toured southern Mississippi and New Orleans to highlight the need for financial assistance in rebuilding these areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Prior to their visit to New Orleans, the Prince received National Building Museum’s Vincent Scully Prize in Washington D.C. The Prince donated $25,000 (£14,000) of the Scully Prize to help restore communities damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nTibet[]\n\nCharles is a supporter of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan freedom movement, and publicly snubbed a state dinner for Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1999 to protest the Chinese government's repressive policies in Tibet.\n\nEastern Orthodox Church[]\n\nPrince Charles is also interested in Orthodoxy[5]. Each year he spends time in the monasteries of Mount Athos in Greece[6] and of Romania[7]. Together with his father Prince Philip, who was born and raised Greek Orthodox, he is a patron of the \"The Friends of Mount Athos\" organization. Prince Charles was also the patron of the \"21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies\"[8], a forum dedicated to the study of the history and art of the former Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine.\n\nRomania[]\n\nPrince Charles has a particular interest in Romania, with which he is said to be in love[9]. He has been interested in the Romanian countryside since the 1980s, when under the rule of the Communist dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu, Romanian villages were destroyed to move farmers to apartment buildings in cities. Since 1997 he has been visiting Romania regularly and has shown a great personal interest in Romania's Orthodox monasteries[10][11] as well as in the fate of the Saxon villages of Transylvania[12] [13] where he purchased a house[14][15]. He is patron to three organizations that are active in Romania: the Mihai Eminescu Trust[16], which manages the restoration of Romanian architecture, the FARA Foundation[17], which runs Romanian orphanages, and INTBAU (the International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture, and Urbanism), an advocate of architecture that respects cultural tradition and identity.\n\nPhilosophy[]\n\nAnother of the Prince's greatest areas of interest continues to be philosophy, especially the philosophy of Asian and Middle Eastern nations, as well as so-called New Age theology. He had a friendship with author Sir Laurens van der Post, whom outsiders called the \"guru to Prince Charles,\" starting in 1977 until van der Post's death in 1996.\n\nAlternative medicine[]\n\nThe Prince has recently become known to be interested in greater exploration of alternative medicine,[18] drawing fire from the medical establishment and those who consider such \"complementary therapies\" to be pseudoscience at best and outright fraud at worst.\n\nHowever, his charity The Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health has been closely involved in a government drive to improve regulation and quality standards in the sector.[19]\n\nAutomobiles[]\n\nThe Prince is also known to have a keen interest in automobiles, particularly the British marque Aston Martin. He has collected numerous Aston models over the years and has tight connections with the brand, so much so that special \"Prince of Wales\" Edition Aston Martins have been created over the years, sporting his favourite colour and trim combinations. He is a frequent visitor to the factory and its service department, and has been a guest of honour at most of the companies special launch events.\n\nCommonwealth[]\n\nCanada[]\n\nTemplate:Cquote2 As Prince of Wales, Prince Charles has paid seventeen visits to Canada, beginning in 1970. Five years later, while serving aboard the HMS Hermes in Canadian waters, the prince spent a week in the Northwest Territories; the Canadian North remains an area that holds a special attraction to him. During Charles' tour of Canada in 1998, with his two sons, he participated in the ceremonies marking the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a part of his desire that his visits help draw attention to relevant issues, including youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation and education.[20]\n\nFurther information: Royal visits to Canada\n\nCharles is also reportedly a fan of Canadian singer and song writer Leonard Cohen.[21]\n\nThe Prince's involvement as Colonel-in-Chief of Canadian Forces regiments permits him to be informed of their activities and allows him opportunity to pay visits while visiting Canada. In 2001, The Prince placed a specially-commissioned wreath, made from vegetation taken from French battlefields, at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He is Colonel-in-Chief of the following Canadian regiments:\n\nTemplate:CAN - The Royal Canadian Dragoons\n\nTemplate:CAN - Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)\n\nTemplate:CAN - The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada\n\nTemplate:CAN - The Royal Regiment of Canada\n\nTemplate:CAN - The Royal Winnipeg Rifles\n\nTemplate:CAN - The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's Own)\n\nThe Prince's keen interest in aboriginal peoples has been explored in Canada while meeting members of its First Nations community. In Winnipeg, Cree and Ojibway students named The Prince “Leading Star” in 1996, and in 2001 he was named Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk, or “the sun looks at him in a good way” during his first visit to the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Prince also became patron of Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1981.\n\nFurther information: List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nThe military training of the Prince of Wales took place in the early 1970s. It included helicopter flying and qualification as a fighter pilot. During the Prince's years in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, he came to fly the following aircraft (the WWII vintage Spitfire arguably having more of a historical/symbolic value than practical importance):\n\nChipmunk basic pilot trainer\n\nHarrier T Mk.4 V/STOL fighter\n\nBAC Jet Provost jet pilot trainer\n\nNimrod maritime patrol aircraft\n\nF-4 Phantom II fighter jet\n\nAvro Vulcan jet bomber\n\nSpitfire classic WWII fighter\n\nPrince Charles served in the Royal Navy for five years:\n\n1971–72: HMS Norfolk\n\n1972–73: HMS Minerva\n\n1974: HMS Jupiter\n\n1974–75: Helicopter flying training at RNAS Yeovilton\n\n1975: Pilot with 845 NAS on HMS Hermes\n\n1976: Captain, HMS Bronington\n\nThe Prince is now also Colonel-in-Chief of the following:\n\nTemplate:GBR - 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards\n\nTemplate:GBR - Royal Dragoon Guards\n\nTemplate:GBR - The 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment\n\nTemplate:GBR - The Parachute Regiment\n\nTemplate:GBR - Royal Gurkha Rifles\n\nTemplate:GBR - Army Air Corps\n\nTemplate:AUS - Royal Australian Armoured Corps\n\nTemplate:PNG - Royal Pacific Islands Regiment\n\nThe Prince is also Air-Commodore-in-Chief of the following:\n\nTemplate:NZL - Royal New Zealand Air Force\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nCommodore-in-Chief, Plymouth\n\nThe Prince also holds the ranks of General (British Army), Admiral (Royal Navy) and Air Chief Marshal (Royal Air Force). He was most recently promoted, to these ranks, on his 58th birthday.\n\nOfficial residence[]\n\nThe Prince of Wales's current official London residence is Clarence House, former London residence of the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (the eighteenth century building has undergone major restoration and renovation to equip it for use by him, his wife, and their personal and office staffs). His previous official residence was an apartment in St. James's Palace. He also has a private estate, Highgrove in Gloucestershire and in Scotland he has use of the Birkhall estate near Balmoral Castle which was previously owned by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.\n\nSome previous Princes of Wales resided in Marlborough House. It however is no longer used as a royal residence. Following the death in 1953 of Queen Mary, widow of King George V, its last royal resident, it was given by Queen Elizabeth II for use by the Commonwealth Secretariat.\n\nPrincipal title in use[]\n\nTemplate:Seealso From his birth until his mother's accession in 1952, he was known as:\n\nHis Royal Highness Prince Charles of Edinburgh\n\nFrom his mother's accession until 1958, he was known as:\n\nHis Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall (outside Scotland)\n\nHis Royal Highness The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay (in Scotland)\n\nSince 1958, he has been known as:\n\nHis Royal Highness The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (outside Scotland)\n\nHis Royal Highness The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay (in Scotland)\n\nIn full (rarely used): His Royal Highness The Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, Great Master and First and Principal Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, Member of the Order of Merit, Knight of the Order of Australia, Companion of the Queen's Service Order, Honorary Member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, Chief Grand Commander of the Order of Logohu, Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty.\n\nIn Canada, the Inuit gave Prince Charles the honorific title Attaniout Ikeneego, meaning \"The Son of the Big Boss.\"[22] The Cree and Ojibway in Winnipeg named Prince Charles Leading Star.[23]\n\nUpon the death of Elizabeth II, if Prince Charles keeps his given name he would become known as King Charles III. Prince Charles has however considered rejecting the title King Charles III when he accedes to the throne because of its associations with Britain's bloody past. The move away from Charles stems from its associations with Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War at the start of Oliver Cromwell's short-lived republic. The executed monarch's son, Charles II, spent 18 years in exile and returned to England in 1660 but was nicknamed \"The Merry Monarch\" because of his string of mistresses. Charles is also associated with the Catholic Bonnie Prince Charlie, an enduring Scottish romantic figure, who claimed the throne as Charles III (the very title Prince Charles would take) in the 18th century. The move would not be a first—three of the past six British monarchs chose regnal title different from their Christian name; for example, George VI was known as Prince Albert ('Bertie' to his family). The most discussed alternative has been George VII, in honour of Charles's grandfather.[24]\n\nMedia and literature[]\n\nCharles appears in Tom Clancy's bestseller Patriot Games (1987) as the target of an assassination attempt. In the later film version however, the character was extensively rewritten with his name and rank changed to Lord Nottingham.\n\nHe and Diana are the models for Mark Helprin's title characters in Freddy and Fredericka.\n\nIn 2000, he made an appearance in the UK soap, Coronation Street, to celebrate the show's 40th anniversary on ITV1. [25]\n\nIn 2005, Prince Charles appeared as himself in New Zealand adult cartoon series Bro'Town. The episode aired on TV3 on Wednesday 26 October and was the final episode in the second series of the popular show. Prince Charles agreed to record some impromptu audio for Series Two while attending a performance from the shows creators during a visit to New Zealand. After some enthusiastic encouragement from Prime Minister Helen Clark (who also appears in the episode), the Prince gave a royal rendition of the Bro'Town catch-cry \"Morningside 4 Life!\"\n\nIn 2006, a court case was filed by Prince Charles against the Mail on Sunday after publication of his extracts from his personal journals. Lawyers for the Prince argued that he was as entitled to keep private documents as any other person. Various revelations were made including his opinions on the takeover of Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China in 1997, in which he described Chinese government officials as \"appalling old waxworks\". His ex-private secretary also alleged that the Prince considers himself a dissident, working against political opinion. [26]\n\nOn Saturday 20 May 2006 ITV presented the 30th birthday of The Prince's Trust. It included songs from Embrace and their song World at our Feet and Annie Lennox with also an interview with Prince Charles, Prince Harry and Prince William from Ant and Dec.\n\nPrince Charles is sometimes referred to in the popular press as \"Chazza\" (along the lines of \"Gazza\", \"Hezza\" and similar coinages of the 1990s).\n\nPrince Charles has been criticized for publishing a memo on ambition and opportunity [27]. This memo was widely understood to criticize meritocracy for creating a competitive society, In humorist Lynn Truss's critique of British manners entitled \"talk to the hand\"[28], Charles's memo is evaluated with respect to the putative impact of meritocracy on British boorishness. Truss came to the conclusion that the prince might have a point, that the positive motivational impact of meritocracy might be balanced against the negative impact of a competitive society.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Wikiquote Template:Wikisource author\n\nOfficial website of HRH The Prince of Wales\n\nMonarchy Wales - leading campaign organisation\n\nMilitary Career\n\nFamily Ties to the Royal Wedding April 9th 2005\n\nOfficial website of 'The Prince's Trust'\n\nView an image of an official portrait of Prince Charles by David Griffiths\n\nThe Prince's Official Canadian Visit (2001)\n\n\"Saskatchewan Honours Future King\" (2001)\n\nSignificance of Treaties Reaffirmed Through Historic Royal Visit (2001)\n\nView clip from Prince Charles interview by David Frost in 1969\n\nSympathetic appraisal of the Prince's contributions to architecture\n\nText of the Prince's 1984 speech criticizing Modern architecture\n\n[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nDimbleby, Jonathan.
