        "text": "Women scientists have made significant contributions in many scientific fields such as astronomy, chemistry and biology.\n\nBut how many of them can you name? Many Scottish women were pioneers in their own fields of research, yet are now largely unknown. Here, we highlight some of their achievements, as well as some of the challenges which they had to face.\n\nIn this video, (former) Science Collections Curator, Catherine Booth uncovers the stories and achievements of two Scottish women scientists — the astronomer Williamina Fleming (1857-1911), and the protozoologist Muriel Robertson (1883-1973).\n\nWomen were only allowed to graduate from Scottish universities after the passing of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. After this time, Scottish universities began to make arrangements for women to study and to graduate on the same terms as men. The first intake of female undergraduates took place in 1892. However, women could not study and graduate from a medical degree until 1916.\n\nIt was also difficult for women to gain senior positions in academia, research, and industry. The Royal Society did not admit women until 1945, while the Royal Society of Edinburgh elected its first female Fellows in 1949.\n\nAlthough the number of women science graduates and postgraduates has increased in recent years, there is still a need to encourage more women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\nA recent report published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh — 'Tapping all our talents': Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (2012) — highlights that only a minority of women science graduates go on to work in the STEM sector. Also, women are still under-represented in senior positions in universities, research institutes, government, business, and industry."
