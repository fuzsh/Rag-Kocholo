        "text": "We are delighted to bathe in the reflected glory of one of our Board members, Patrick Macdonald, today being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). The RSE is Scotland’s national academy with a Fellowship of 1,800 drawn from the sciences, arts, business, professions and the third and public sectors – it plays a leading part in advising policymakers, inspiring innovators and helping tackle the most pressing issues of the day.\n\nPatrick said “I’m honoured to join the RSE and its fantastic group of Fellows whose expertise, understanding and knowledge contribute so much to social and economic wellbeing both nationally and internationally. I look forward to playing my full part in its influential and important work.”\n\nNatureSpace CEO Tom Tew congratulated Patrick: “Patrick has been one of our NEDs right from the formation of NatureSpace in 2018, knowing the depth and quality of his engagement with us, for which we are tremendously grateful, and the breadth of his professional and charitable contributions over his career, it is a delight, but no surprise, to see him being honoured in this way.”"
