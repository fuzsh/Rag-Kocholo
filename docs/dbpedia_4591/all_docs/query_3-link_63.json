        "text": "“The RSE fellowship has a unique breadth of experience in academic disciplines, the arts and business and fellows contribute to contemporary issues to benefit Scotland and beyond. I look forward to helping to further its aims and objectives”\n\nProfessor Lesley Torrance, Director of Science at the James Hutton Institute, has been made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), a body which contributes to the social, cultural and economic wellbeing of Scotland through the advancement of learning and useful knowledge.\n\nEstablished in 1783, RSE has announced 64 new UK and International Fellows. These Fellows were elected following a rigorous examination of their achievements and will help RSE continue providing independent and expert advice to policymakers, support aspiring entrepreneurs, develop research capacity and leadership and engage with the public through events.\n\nOn the announcement, Professor Torrance said: “I am delighted and honoured to be invited to become a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\n“The RSE fellowship has a unique breadth of experience in academic disciplines, the arts and business and fellows contribute to contemporary issues to benefit Scotland and beyond. I look forward to helping to further its aims and objectives.”\n\nLesley is based on the Institute’s Dundee site; she is a Director of Science with responsibilities for the strategic direction and delivery of the science programme, including leadership of the RESAS Strategic Research Programme, oversight of the Cell and Molecular Sciences and Ecological Sciences departments and the Institute’s Postgraduate School and interactions with the universities of Dundee and St Andrews.\n\nLesley continues her research as a Professor in Plant Virology in the University of St Andrews’ School of Biology. She currently leads inter-disciplinary projects to develop sustainable, climate-resilient potatoes with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Kenya and Malawi. She has held significant scientific leadership roles, including a recent appointment to the Independent Science for Development Council of CGIAR, a global partnership that unites international organisations engaged in research for a food-secured future.\n\nThe RSE is an educational charity, registered in Scotland, operating on a wholly independent and non-party-political basis and providing public benefit throughout Scotland. There are currently around 1600 Fellows, who are based in Scotland, the rest of the UK and beyond, representing the full range of physical and life sciences, arts, humanities, social sciences, education, professions, industry, business and public life.\n\nProfessor Dame Anne Glover, President of the RSE concludes: “The diverse expertise and experience of our fellows means that, as an organisation, we are well-placed to respond to the issues of the day with clear informed thinking free from commercial or political influence.\n\n\"Our new fellows, who we look forward to welcoming, not only hold vast knowledge but also deep experience, keen judgement, boundless enthusiasm and a passion for promoting societal development and change. By using their talents as a collective, we can often unlock or inspire new potential and unearth fresh solutions to some of the most complex issues Scotland’s society faces today.”"
