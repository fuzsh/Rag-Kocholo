        "text": "Our senior academy, The Royal Society of Edinburgh, has today announced 57 newly-elected Fellows. They will be joining the RSE’s current Fellowship, which comprises 1,800 people who are recognised as being some of the greatest thinkers, researchers and practitioners in their field working in or with organisations in Scotland today.\n\nWe are delighted that six alumni of the Young Academy of Scotland are among them:\n\nProfessor Stephen Brusatte, Professor of Palaeontology and Evolution, University of Edinburgh\n\nProfessor Sarah Coulthurst, Professor of Microbial Interactions, University of Dundee\n\nProfessor Marc Dweck, Professor of Clinical Cardiology, University of Edinburgh\n\nProfessor Ross Forgan, Professor of Supramolecular and Materials Chemistry, University of Glasgow\n\nProfessor Jonathan Fraser, Director of Research, Mathematics, University of St Andrews\n\nProfessor Victoria Martin, Professor of Collider Physics, University of Edinburgh\n\nThese new Fellows join 42 other YAS members and alumni who have previously been welcomed into the RSE. While YAS members do not automatically become Fellows, the increasing number of YAS members and alumni in the RSE Fellowship is a testament to the excellence, drive, and creativity of our members. To be appointed RSE Fellows, these individuals have undergone rigorous assessment of their achievements, professional standing and the contribution they and their work make to wider society.\n\nProfessor Sir John Ball, President of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, said: “It is an immense honour to extend a warm welcome to each of our distinguished new Fellows.\n\nIndividually, they embody exceptional dedication and accomplishment spanning multiple sectors and disciplines. Collectively, they demonstrate a profound commitment and determination to make meaningful contributions through their endeavours.\n\nFrom groundbreaking research that redefines our understanding to the creative pursuits that inspire and enrich our cultural landscape, the RSE proudly embraces the brightest minds, leveraging their unique expertise and perspectives for the betterment of society.\n\nAs Scotland’s National Academy, we remain committed to mobilising a diverse array of expertise to confront society’s most pressing challenges, and I am certain that our new Fellows will prove invaluable assets to the RSE.”"
