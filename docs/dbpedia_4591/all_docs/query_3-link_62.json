        "text": "BiGGAR Economics was commissioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), Scotland’s National Academy, to evaluate the economic impact of its Enterprise Fellowship programme.\n\nOur study found that the programme has added almost £170 million to annual global GVA, including £77 million in Scotland. It has led to the creation of more than 3,000 jobs, nearly half (1,395) of which are in Scotland and over 200 businesses.\n\nFor every £1 investment, the Fellowship programme is estimated to have generated almost £10 for the UK economy and £6 for the Scottish economy.\n\nThe study also found that businesses created by Fellows are more sustainable than the average, with over 81% of businesses created still operating beyond five years. This compares positively with average survival rates for start-ups and spin-outs, where around 45% survive to their fifth year.\n\nThe full report can be read via the link below."
