        "text": "Professor Hopkins is a leading social geographer with an international reputation for his research on race, religion, gender, and youth. Specifically, he has played a key role in the development of an international field of research focused on Muslim identities and Islamophobia. He has been involved in several significant studies that have had a direct impact on policymaking and practice in Scotland. This includes a report with Scottish Refugee Council that helped inform how to provide support for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and Scottish Government research about everyday experiences of sectarianism.\n\nMost recently, Professor Hopkins helped establish a new Scottish Parliament Cross Party Group on Tackling Islamophobia with Anas Sarwar MSP in 2018, which was the largest and most active in the Scottish Parliament. Through this group, he led the first ever inquiry into Islamophobia in Scotland which produced over 50 recommendations for policy change, and he also co-produced media guidance for journalists.\n\nIn addition, Professor Hopkins’ research has informed Education Institute for Scotland’s guidance about Islamophobia and work about involving school pupils in research that has been adopted by Glasgow City Council’s education services research strategy group.\n\nProfessor Hopkins said: “It is such an honour to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s National Academy. I am very much encouraged by the Society’s focus on tackling some of the most pressing social issues, including challenges that I focus on in my own work such as those connected to racism, Islamophobia, gender inequalities, and youth exclusion. I am delighted to be joining the 1800-strong fellowship working to advance learning and useful knowledge for the public good.”\n\nExceptional dedication and accomplishment\n\nProfessor Hopkins is one of 57 new Fellows announced by the RSE and follows in the footsteps of Benjamin Franklin and Sir Walter Scott.\n\nFellows have a fundamental role to play in enabling the RSE to deliver on its mission of ‘Knowledge made Useful’ and acceptance of Fellowship implies a strong commitment to the objectives of the RSE to inspire, engage, provide expertise, and promote the organisation and its work.\n\nPresident of the RSE, Professor Sir John Ball PRSE, said: “It is an immense honour to extend a warm welcome to each of our distinguished new Fellows.\n\n“Individually, they embody exceptional dedication and accomplishment spanning multiple sectors and disciplines.
