He received his doctorate from the University of St Andrews where he held a Donald Bullough and a Carnegie Scholarship. He completed his research Masters at the University of Oxford in 2005 and was a Norwegian Government Research Scholar at the University of Oslo from 2002 to 2003. His research focuses on the inter-relationship between monastic groups and secular elites in the Early Middle Ages, the transformation of the Frankish world in the seventh century, the cult of the saints in the Early and High Middle Ages, early medieval hagiography and its manuscript transmission, and with the Irish monastic founder, Columbanus, and his Italian biographer, Jonas of Bobbio. He has completed a major new translation of Jonas of Bobbio’s three saints’ Lives with Professor Ian Wood published in 2017 with Liverpool University Press as Jonas of Bobbio: Life of Columbanus, Life of John of Réomé, and Life of Vedast. He was awarded a Research Grant from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) for “The Columbanian Network: Elite Identities and Christian Communities in Early Medieval Europe (550–750)” at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. This project, which ran from 2013 to 2016, explored how the role of monasteries and their relationship to the social world around them was transformed in the seventh century in Europe as monastic institutions became more integrated into social and political power networks. The project focused on one of the central actors in this process, the Irish ascetic exile and monastic founder, Columbanus (c. 550–615), and the monastic network he and his Frankish disciples established in Merovingian Gaul and Lombard Italy. Two further volumes have resulted from this project, a monograph and an edited volume: Jonas of Bobbio and the Legacy of Columbanus: Sanctity and Community in the Seventh Century and Columbanus and the Peoples of Post-Roman Europe, both published by Oxford University Press in 2018.\n\nHe will be giving a series of lectures in Dublin, Galway, and Belfast in November 2018 on Columbanus, Robert Schuman, and the Idea of Europe for the European Year of Cultural Heritage funded by the European Union.\n\nAgnès Lafont\n\nUniversity Paul Valery – Montpellier 3, France\n\nagnes.lafont@univ-montp3.fr\n\nAgnès Lafont is Associate Professor in Early Modern Literature at the University Paul-Valery Montpellier 3 (France) and a member of The Institute for Research on the Renaissance, the Neo-classical Age and the Enlightenment (IRCL), a joint research centre of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier 3.\n\nHer essays have appeared in EMLS (Early Modern Literary Studies), Anglophonia (French Journal of English Studies), XVII-XVIII (Bulletin de la Société d'Études Anglo-Américaines des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles), Cahiers Charles V, Imago. Revista de Emblemática y cultura visual, Revue LISA/LISA e-journal as well as in scholarly collections such as Les Contemporains de Shakespeare (ed. L. Cottegnies, J.-M. Maguin and F. Laroque, Pléiade, Paris, 2009). Her first book is entitled Shakespeare’s Erotic Mythology and Ovidian Renaissance Culture (Routledge, 2013). Her second book is a collection of essays co-edited with Janice Valls-Russell and Charlotte Coffin, entitled Interweaving Myths in Shakespeare and his contemporaries (Manchester University Press, 2017) Dr. Lafont’s third book, also a collection of essays co-edited with Christian Belin and Nicholas Myers, is currently in circulation to presses. It is entitled: L’Image brisée aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles. Breaking the Image in the Renaissance (Paris, Classique Garnier, forthcoming 2019). She is assistant editor for Cahiers Elisabéthains since 2009 http://cae.sagepub.com/\n\nFrom July 2012 to December 2012, she benefited from a Research Fellowship granted by the National Council of French Universities (CNU) to work on her first book. She was a visiting professor at The University of Texas at Austin for the 2018 Spring semester.\n\nAgnès will use her time at the Moore Institute to finalize her critical edition (English text with critical apparatus) of an Ovidian epyllion by William Barksted entitled Mirrha The Mother of Adonis: Or, Lustes Prodigies (1607) which freely translates and adapts Ovid’s Metamorphoses X.298-519 and explicitly offers itself as a prequel to Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis. It narrates the incestuous love of Myrrha for her father, Cyniras, and the birth of their son, Adonis. She will also provide a seminar open to staff and students of the Institute and NUI Galway to present her project.\n\nWhile she’ll be at the Moore Institute, Agnès will primarily be working with Dr. Lindsay Reid as they share a keen interest on Tudor and Early Modern transmissions of classical mythology. They have started working together at the Renaissance Society of America (New Orleans, 2018) and are willing to establish a longstanding collaboration between their respective research centres.\n\nAlexander O’Hara\n\nUniversity of St. Andrews\n\nalexanderjohara@gmail.com\n\nDr Alexander O’Hara is Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Mediaeval History, University of St Andrews and was a Research Fellow at the Institut für Mittelalterforshung in the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna from 2009 to 2016 and a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

Her investigative work directly contributed to the exoneration of Angel Echavarria, who was sentenced to life without parole and served 21 years for a murder he didn’t commit before his release in 2015. Her role with the Justice Brandeis Law Project at the Schuster Institute included seminar-style meetings with undergraduate students to discuss presumed wrongful conviction cases, explore new leads and further case investigations. She was selected as a US Fulbright scholar and worked with the Irish Innocence Project at Griffith College in Dublin for the 2013-2014 academic year and taught law and journalism students journalism skills in order to further investigations of wrongful conviction cases. Through her work, the Irish Innocence Project became one of only two innocence organizations out of 68 recognized by the Innocence Network with a collaborative model of including both law and journalism students as caseworkers. The following year, she was hired as project manager of the Irish Innocence Project at Griffith College Dublin and she organized the first ever International Wrongful Conviction Conference and Film Festival. During her tenure, the Irish Innocence Project also helped obtain the first posthumous presidential pardon of Harry Gleeson, wrongfully convicted and hanged in 1941 for the murder of his neighbor Molly McCarthy in Tipperary.\n\nAnne is currently a second-time US Fulbright scholar (2018-2019) teaching about wrongful convictions and investigative techniques to law and journalism students at the National University of Ireland, Galway and is also conducting research to establish a National Registry of Exonerations in Ireland. Originally trained as a social worker who spent years counseling court-involved adolescent girls, she remains a licensed certified social worker in Massachusetts and is the author of a self-help series of guidebooks for girls called Girl to Girl. As a journalist, she has devoted her career to covering issues of human rights, social justice, and human development and has sought to make a difference in the world, one story at a time. She was the 2016 recipient of the Salem Award for Human Rights and Social Justice, is a Moth storyteller and the author of the Amazon Kindle mini-memoir series Irish You Were Here. She has been selected to give a TEDx talk about wrongful convictions on October 21, 2018 entitled Bearing Witness in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nBridget English\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\n\nBridgetrenglish@gmail.com\n\nDr. Bridget English is currently a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She received her PhD in English from Maynooth University, where she was also a lecturer. In addition to the wide array of literature and writing courses she taught at the above institutions she also taught for several years in New York. She is a specialist in modern and contemporary Irish literature and culture, with particular research interests in theories of the novel, modernism, and the medical humanities. Her monograph, Laying Out the Bones: Death and Dying in the Modern Irish Novel (Syracuse U.P. 2017), examines the ways that Irish wake and funeral rituals shape novelistic discourse, arguing that the treatment of death in Irish novels offers a way of making sense of mortality and provides insight into Ireland’s cultural and historical experience of death. Additional publications include book chapters on John McGahern, Anne Enright, and a forthcoming chapter on Irish crime fiction.\n\nAt the Moore Institute, English will conduct research on the themes of medicine, illness, and bodily pain in the context of modernism, and twentieth-century and contemporary Irish writing. This research will contribute to English’s current book project, “Self-Destructive Modernisms: Suicide, Medicine, and Failure in the Modernist Novel” which attends to the ways that the modernist novel registers the conflicts between the empirical knowledge of medicine and the subjective human experiences of modernity in order to determine the role of novelistic narrative in mediating bodily and psychological suffering. Taking the contrast between medical determinism—that psychological phenomena are explained by a combination of environmental and genetic factors—and humanistic medicine as its starting point, this study takes a transnational approach to Irish, American, and British novels in order to consider the ways that medical narratives influence the modernist aesthetics of rational thought and faith in technological innovation. Analyzing a cross-section of novels that related to the themes of suicide and failure—Elizabeth Bowen’s The House in Paris, Samuel Beckett’s The Unnameable, William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night, James Joyce’s Ulysses and Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway—“Self-Destructive Modernisms” interrogates the complex relationship between modernist novels and medical narratives in the transnational context of empire and nation (re) building.\n\nChris Collins\n\nUniversity of Nottingham\n\nchristopher.collins@nottingham.ac.uk\n\nChris is an Assistant Professor of Drama at the University of Nottingham, U.K. He has published widely on Irish theatre, including two monographs on the work of Irish writer, J.M. Synge (Theatre and Residual Culture [Palgrave: 2016], and J.M. Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World [Routledge: 2016]). He is currently writing his third book on Synge entitled J.M. Synge and the Time of His Life.\n\nSynge witnessed and wrote about profound changes to Irish society and culture during his short lifetime: 1871-1909. This was a Victorian age of progress, and everything needed to be clocked: from the time it took the Galway train to travel to Dublin, to those cultures of the empire that had supposedly failed to evolve. Synge had a keen interest in how progress should be measured, and his plays and prose offer unique perspectives on the measurement of time and the modernisation of Irish society. Synge’s fascination with time also had a particular personal appeal. As early as 1899 Synge knew he was dying young. Immediately thereafter he set about travelling Ireland, writing prose, verse and plays about spaces and places that were rapidly changing in front of his eyes. His reflections on time helped him cope with his own knowledge that he was dying young. A mixture of biography, social history and critical analysis of his plays and prose, the significance of this project is that it will explore how Synge staged and wrote about linear and non-linear time in the Ireland of his time, both as a reflection on modernisation and as a coping mechanism for the finiteness of time in his personal life.\n\nChris will be using his time at the Moore Institute to consult the digital archives of Synge’s diaries, journals and notebooks, as well as the Abbey Theatre and Druid Theatre digital archives.\n\nChris Maginn\n\nFordham University, New York\n\ncmaginn@fordham.edu\n\nChris Maginn is Professor of History and the former Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at Fordham University in New York. He received his doctorate from the National University of Ireland, Galway. He has published widely on Irish and British history, with a particular focus on the Anglo-Irish relationship in the Tudor period. His first book ‘Civilizing’ Gaelic Leinster: the extension of Tudor rule in the O’Byrne and O’Toole lordships (Dublin, 2005) was awarded the National University of Ireland’s Irish Historical Research Prize in 2005. He co-wrote, with Steven Ellis, the textbook The Making of the British Isles: the state of Britain and Ireland, 1450-1660 (London, 2007). He is also the author of William Cecil, Ireland, and the Tudor State (Oxford, 2012) and The Tudor Discovery of Ireland (Dublin, 2015). He was the Irish American Cultural Institute/NUIG Fellow in Irish Studies at the Centre for Irish Studies in 2014 and in 2016 he co-edited a collection of essays entitled Frontiers, states and identity in early modern Ireland and beyond: essays in honour of Steven G. Ellis (Dublin, 2016).\n\nWhile at the Moore Institute, he will be working on a book which aims to explore how the Tudor kings and queens communicated their rule in Ireland. The research will concentrate on operational forms of communication – like the relationship between the transmission within government circles of information and the influence which that information exerted on the making of political policy – and more abstract forms of communication, like the crown’s use of orality, printed texts, symbolism and political messaging, both to make its power felt and to articulate its aims. Central to the consideration of this latter form of communication will be an analysis of the ultimate failure of the Tudors to counter the widely-held view, expressed at the time and ever since, that their true aim was to conquer Ireland. In addition to this, he will be exploring the history of the town of Galway in the later sixteenth century.\n\nDaniel Fernández Fuentes\n\nFundación Cultura de Paz (Spain).\n\nlagartofernandez@gmail.com\n\nEDUC-ACTORS: FROM CONTEXT TO TEXT. Rethinking the education on peace, conflict transformation, social justice and global citizenship through the lens of the Arts.\n\nEducation is at the center of the ethical, socio-political and environmental crisis we are currently experiencing. As expressed by UNESCO in its Program of Action for the Creation of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence, the hope of emerging from this global crisis lies in educating about values, attitudes and behaviors that reflect and inspire sharing through social interaction, fostering the distinctive faculties of the human species: commitment, reflection, imagination and creativity, facilitating interculturality and communication (and not only information). Likewise, the Incheon Declaration resulting from the World Education Forum 2015 urgently urges us to prepare a unified educational agenda that aspires to be holistic and inclusive, based on human rights and dignity; social justice; inclusion; cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity; and co-responsibility within the wide frame of global citizenship. But what would such a unified educational agenda look like in practice, and what kind of future does it envision?\n\nUNESCO’s vision would seem to be a world at peace. Yet the meaning of peace is often assumed to be settled by those who advance the cause of peace, even if this entails appropriating the narratives of the oppressed, and even though – as argued by Oliver Richmond and J. P. Lederach – many attempts at conflict resolution have ended in co-optation, i.e. attempts to forcibly abolish disharmony in situations where people are raising legitimate issues about social justice, reconciliation, identity, gender, culture, or development, among others. As Arjun Appadurai states, the transformation of such structural violence involves the defense of communication processes, in a world suffering from endless information: etymological communication implies community, sharing, and common sense, as well as the aspiration to expand what we all have in common.\n\nHence, peace should be envisioned as an agonistic process, such that conflict is understood as inherent to social life, and it is a force that holds the opportunity for the transformation of social conditions. A process of learning, at the individual and social level, to make sense of the internal and external violence that exists around and within us. As the victimizer is inside each of us, the human impulse to violence is what needs to be addressed, through participatory processes which aim to transform the ways in which conflict plays out at the micro-level of inter-subjective relations. These necessary participatory processes have set the basis that defines the dynamic pedagogical proposal that I am currently developing, which aims to simultaneously learn and teach how to deal with human inner and outer forms of violence: “EDUC-ACTORS: FROM CONTEXT TO TEXT. Rethinking the education on peace, conflict transformation, social justice, and global citizenship - Towards a participatory, integrative and critical pedagogy inspired in the culture of peace and non-violence, applied through the narratives in first person, the new technologies, informed by the transformative power of creativity and the arts.”\n\nSuch proposal of participatory pedagogy follows the thread proposed by Paolo Freire, seeking to honor the narratives that contest official history and identity – those imposed by the victors as much as through the educational spaces where they are enforced upon victims – thus perpetuating violence. These contesting narratives include not only written or oral rational forms, but all creative expressions, heightening our ability to tell our own stories through the art of music, dance, theater, painting, photography, audiovisuals, digital media, and poetry. Therefore, a model of participatory pedagogy of conflict transformation would be informed by the arts such as Katherine Wood explores: “The arts fundamentally change the discourse around conflict and peace...The transformative power of the arts largely lies in the fact that art operates in the physical, emotional, and existential realms. Existentially, the arts express and interpret the human search for meaning, purpose, community, identity, and values by which to live. These values, material or otherwise, are deeply embedded in the lives of individuals, groups, and nations, with roots in differing views of the world. The arts can open and enlarge someone’s worldview and enhance understanding of another’s, leading to empathy and inclusion.”\n\nDuring my research, as a Visiting Scholar at the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University (2016 to present), I concluded that attempting to rethink peace studies and peace education would require an empirical, global research concerned with context-specific interpretations of peace, staging contestations through the arts, thereby disturbing the ways that metanarratives regarding peace and violence tend to ignore local histories, and contextualized struggles. This journey is leading, as Boaventura de Sousa Santos, Budd L. Hall and Rajesh Tandon urge us, to un-learn in order to be able to “decolonize” our minds and our pedagogical practices, while encouraging us to stand up for encouraging us to generate our own meanings of individual and communal memory, cultural translation and intercultural dialogue. Identifying and exploring good practices of participatory conflict transformation pedagogy informed by the arts, in places where violence is more evident in a daily basis, has to do with the relevance of University as universitas: the word without action is empty, and scientific concepts without experience are vain. These experiences would be sought among significant educators, mediators, artivists, and advocates which invite the arts to facilitate the transformation of inner and outer conflicts in a nonviolent way.\n\nThese indispensable exchanges inform the second phase of the project: a pedagogical pilot proposal which would outline an academic curriculum focused on participatory conflict transformation methodologies which articulate around the languages of the arts. The scope of the previous international research favors a much needed pedagogical approach that acknowledges and integrates Western, Eastern and Indigenous worldviews. The pedagogical curriculum proposal would understand peace as an ever-evolving and dynamic process of nonviolent conflict transformation. An integrative and holistic process, as defined by Linda Groff, which aspires to equal the importance of building positive \"outer\" peace (Western approach), inner/spiritual peace (Eastern approach), and the urgency to eradicate violence against the environment (Indigenous/Animistic/Earth-based approach).\n\nDavid McOmish\n\nUniversity of Glasgow\n\nDavid.McOmish@glasgow.ac.uk\n\nDavid completed a PhD in Classics at the University of Glasgow (2010), where he also latterly worked as a full-time, fixed-term Teaching Fellow in Latin Literature and Language (2011). From 2012-2015, he was Research Fellow and Lead Researcher on the AHRC-funded Delitiae project at Glasgow, which examined the role and place of Latin Literature and Literary Culture in early modern Scotland. The majority of David's time on the project was spent researching the astronomical and mathematical work of Adam King, an Edinburgh native and long-time Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Paris, whose work will be the focus of David's stay at the Moore Institute. More recently, David was Research Fellow at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute in Innsbruck, Austria, where he worked on Adam King’s Latin didactic verse and prose commentary and its function as a conduit for the delivery of the new sciences of the early modern period into the University of Edinburgh in the 17th century. Currently an Honorary Research Fellow, David continues his work on Adam King at the Centre for Research Collections at Edinburgh University, where he is transcribing and critically assessing the large manuscript edition that contains King's prose and verse. In the last year, he has published some of his research findings on the impact of cross-confessional (Calvinist and Jesuitical) ideas upon Adam King's approach to teaching science (History of Universities 31.2, 153-172, Oxford 2018), exploring how King openly embraced the philosophy of protestant reformer Petrus Ramus, while also producing a substantial (and pointed) corpus of pro-Catholic, Counter-Reformation material.\n\nDavid will use his time at the Moore Institute to edit and develop the first full critical edition (parallel Latin and English text with critical apparatus) of the poetry of Adam King. He will provide weekly reading groups open to staff and students of the Institute and NUI Galway on a selection of King's poetry. These reading sessions will offer an opportunity to explore the ways in which King's dual confessional identity informs his approach to natural philosophy in his didactic (scientific) poetry and commentary, his Counter-Reformation prose and verse, and his pro-Stuart political propaganda poems.\n\nThis year, David will be presenting his work on Adam King at Scientiae 2019 (held in Belfast this year), and also the Fédération internationale des associations d'études classiques 2019 conference.\n\nEmmet Marron\n\nNUI Galway\n\nmarronemmet@gmail.com\n\nDr Emmet Marron works primarily on Early Medieval monastic landscapes, with a focus on the Post-Roman West. Although his background is in Archaeology his work takes an interdisciplinary approach to the topic, with a particular interest in the contrast between hagiographical texts and the archaeological reality, as well as in ethnicity and ethnic identity in the period spanning the 4th to the 8th centuries.\n\nA graduate of NUI, Galway, from 2008 to 2012 he conducted his Ph.D at the Moore Institute as part of the IRC and Mellon Foundation funded Columbanus’ Life and Legacy Project. His doctoral thesis focussed on the first monastery founded on the continent by the influential Irish monk, Saint Columbanus, at Annegray in Eastern France. Archaeological work carried out as part of Dr Marron’s research at Annegray under the auspices of the Moore Institute (2009-2013) represent the first campaign of archaeological fieldwork carried out by an Irish HEI on the continent.\n\nIn 2013 Dr Marron was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship as part of the Columbanus’ Life and Legacy Project at the Moore Institute, during which time he oversaw the completion of further overseas archaeological fieldwork with collaborative fieldschools at Annegray (France), Bobbio (Italy) and Cleenish (Northern Ireland). During this time, he was also involved in the formation of Making Europe: Columbanus and his Legacy, an international scientific committee drawing together researchers in complimentary disciplines from across Europe to collaborate on the study of St Columbanus in the run up to the 2015 anniversary of the saint’s death. In addition to a series of collaborative fieldwork projects (Cleenish, Annegray, Bobbio), the committee oversaw the successful organisation of three international conferences – held at Bangor, Luxeuil and Bobbio - focussing on different aspects of Columbanus’ influence over the course of the anniversary year.\n\nExpanding out from the focus on Annegray, in 2016 Dr Marron was awarded a Marie Skłodowska Curie Individual Fellowship for his project The Chronology of Monastic Landscapes in Early Medieval Europe (ChroMoLEME), based at Newcastle University. The project aimed to interrogate the motif of the ‘desertum’, commonly found in hagiographical treatments of monastic foundations, through the use of landscape analysis on a number of key Early Medieval monasteries across Europe – a significant element in the project’s approach to this question was the application of Historical Landscape Characterisation to sites in continental Europe, in contexts where this approach had never been used before. As part of the ChroMoLEME project Dr Marron held a successful conference at the British School at Rome on the question of the ‘desertum’, the proceedings of which will form part of an upcoming edited volume as part of Brepols’ Boundaries, Borders, Landscape series.\n\nDuring his time at the Moore Institute Emmet will be working with former supervisor on the Columbanus’ Life and Legacy Project, Conor Newman, to edit the proceedings of the 2015 anniversary conference held in Bangor, Co. Down. To date fellow members of the Making Europe Committee have overseen the publication of the proceedings of the Bobbio and Luxeuil conferences. As such, the Bangor proceedings will represent not only the final volume in an important treatment of Saint Columbanus, but also the successful culmination of work underway at the Moore Institute since 2008.\n\nHeike Schwarz\n\nAugsburg University, Germany\n\nheike.schwarz@philhist.uni-augsburg.de\n\nDr. Heike Schwarz is a post-doc lecturer in American studies and Comparative studies at Augsburg University. She studied American studies, politics, philosophy and law. She is currently writing her habilitation project, or second book, with the working title Psychoterratica: Concepts of Solastalgia and Nature Distress Syndrome in (World) Fiction which includes approaches of the environmental humanities and medical humanities. She has published on fiction, film and graphic novels in the fields of psychiatry and fiction, disability studies, popular culture studies, dementia studies, medical and environmental humanities and ecopsychology. She has received a number of fellowships for studies in Europe and the United States, she is also a Fulbright fellow and recently worked at the University of Pittsburgh as visiting scholar. She co-edited the essay collection Border Stories: Narration of Peace, Conflict and Communication as a book publication of an international conference. The co-edited book with Dr. Tina-Karen Pusse and Rebecca Downes from NUI Galway Madness in the Woods: Representations of the Ecologlical Uncanny will be published this year.\n\nShe finished her PhD project in 2013 with her interdisciplinary study Beware of the Other Side(s): Multiple Personality Disorder and Dissociative Identity Disorder in American Fiction. This study emerged from an interdisciplinary angle including the history of American psychiatric diagnoses and their reflection in American fiction and how both fields were mutually entangled and interdependent.\n\nThe second book project title Psychoterratica refers to an ecocritical and ecopsychological approach to the fiction analysed in the book. This approach is based on the interdisciplinary field of medical humanities, an emerging discipline which pinpoints the relevance of literary representation of illness and diagnoses, shaping a general understanding of (contemporary) diseases and conditions. Combining medical humanities with the field of environmental studies or ecocriticsm, the projects aims at analysing (world) literature in order to unveil mental as well as physical conditions that develop because of environmental and climate change or global warming. Through the literary works, various cultural communities around the world and individual artists express and represent their physical as well as psychological conditions that emerge because of environmental change that literally endangers their indigenous and various other cultural backgrounds. The ecocritical embedment of the study moreover highlights the interconnectedness of human beings with their non-human surroundings and follows, for example, the term “solastalgia” given by Australian anthropologist Glenn Albrecht who defines this term also as “nature distress syndrome” after environmental change. The focus on health and climate change usually entails sociological and empirical studies, whereas in this book project the main sources are literary works in which the interconnection of health and environment becomes obvious. Apart from the WHO and its medical health report approach, the cultural outputs of various communities and artists dealing with environmental change need to be considered and heard.\n\nAt Moore Institute she will continue her research and will also present at the summer school “Posthumanist Ecocriticism”. The Moore Institute fellowship enables her to add an Irish perspective to her interdisciplinary work.\n\nJ. R. Carpenter\n\nUniversity of Plymouth\n\nwritingcoastlines@gmail.com\n\nJ. R. Carpenter is a artist, writer, and practice-led researcher working across performance writing, digital literature, cartography, and media archaeology. Questions about place, displacement, migration, and climate change pervade her work. She was awarded a PhD from University of the Arts London in 2015. During a postdoctoral visiting fellowship at the Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library she researched an Island of Demons which appeared on maps off Newfoundland in the early 1500s persisting into the 1700s. Portions of this research were presented through the British Library’s Summer Scholar series and published on the British Library American Collections Blog. She received funding from the Canada Council for the Arts to further this research at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies at Memorial University in St John’s. She has presented keynote addresses based on this research at international symposiums including “On the Inhabitability of Cartographic Worlds” at the University of Paris 8 and “Transient Topographies: Space and Interface in Digital Literature and Art,” the second Galway Digital Cultures Initiative conference, which took place at the Moore Institute in April 2018. She has since been commissioned by the « Mondes, interfaces et environnements à l’ère du numérique » research group at the University of Paris 8 to create a new web-based work based on practice-led research undertaken in the cartographic collections at the Archives nationales in Paris.\n\nCarpenter is an award-winning author of print and digital poetry. Her web-based work The Gathering Cloud won the New Media Writing Prize 2016 and has since been exhibited in Denmark, Norway, Romania, the USA, and the UK. A print book by the same name was published by Uniformbooks in 2017. Her debut poetry collection An Ocean of Static was Highly Commended for the Forward Prizes 2018. It launched at the British Library in London and has since been presented at Cúirt International Festival of Literature, Edinburgh International Book Festival, and Oslo Poisefilm Festival.\n\nDuring her fellowship at the Moore Institute, Carpenter will further her research into phantom islands of the North Atlantic with a particular focus on the islands which the Irish Saint Brendan is said to have landed upon during a voyage begun in AD 512. A Saint Brendan’s Island has migrated westward on maps of the North Atlantic for over 1000 years. Today, a Saint Brendan’s Island hovers just off the larger island of Newfoundland. Carpenter’s research explores the navigational aspects of the narrative of Saint Brendan’s Island, and in the textual and cartographic modes through which it has been propigated over the centuries. How might the medieval navigational narrative be adapted to (or even akin to) contemporary digital narratives as they move through multiple times, places, and media? How might this multi-media story, composed of religious allegory, hearsay, maps, and scraps of manuscripts, be adapted for the web?\n\nJacqueline-Bethel Mougoué\n\nBaylor University\n\nJB_mougoue@Baylor.edu\n\nJacqueline-Bethel Mougoué is an interdisciplinary feminist scholar of Africa who is particularly interested in how constructions of gender inform the comportment and performances of the body, religious beliefs, and political ideologies in Cameroon. Currently, she is an Assistant Professor of History at Baylor University. Mougoué received her M.A. and Ph.D. in history from Purdue University. She holds an additional degree from Purdue, a Graduate Certificate in Women’s, Gender, & Sexuality Studies (WGSS) from the WGSS Program. Mougoué’s first book, Gender, Separatist Politics and Embodied Nationalism in Cameroon is forthcoming with the University of Michigan Press in 2019. Mougoué’s scholarly articles have appeared in Gender & History, Journal of West African History, Feminist Africa, and Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism.\n\nAs a 2019-20 Visiting Fellow at the Moore Institute, Mougoué will be working on her second book project, Manhood, Religion and Transcontinental Networks in Africa. The book will examine the history of the Bahá’í Faith and masculine identities in English-Speaking Cameroon from the 1950s to the 1980s. It examines how religious identities, and extensive networks, shaped the performance of manhood when men converted to Bahá’í— a religion founded in Iran that teaches the essential worth of all religions, that believe in one God. Young men who could not find jobs after attending Christian mission schools, found conversion to Bahá’í an appealing alternative. Through it they found jobs as Bahá’í missionaries, converting Africans throughout the continent, including a king in Benin in the 1970s. Further, they forged extensive social and economic transcontinental networks that would eventually extend to Israel, and lead to marriages that spanned national and racial lines. Through Bahá’í, young men found new ways to (re)claim economic power, social standing, and ultimately, masculine ideals that informed the respect they gained as Bahá’í missionaries. The project draws from a wide array of sources to analyze and visually represent the interplay of ideas about proper codes of conduct for men and constructions of religious authority: birthday cards from the 1950s, oral interviews with men who converted in the 1950s and 1960s, and 1970s studio portraits of Bahá’í converts.\n\nJelena Đureinović\n\nJustus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany\n\nJelena.Dureinovic@geschichte.uni-giessen.de\n\nJelena Đureinović is an instructor of record in East European History and a Career Development Grant recipient at the International Graduate Centre for the Study of Culture at the University of Giessen. She submitted her PhD thesis in Modern and Contemporary History in 2018, entitled “Glory for the Defeated: Memory of Second World War Collaboration, Resistance, and Retribution in Contemporary Serbia”, and is currently waiting for the defence. In 2017-18, she was a visiting fellow at the Centre for Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, funded by the Scholarship Foundation of the Republic of Austria. She was also a visiting researcher at the Institute of Culture and Memory Studies of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2016. Jelena has contributed to numerous international summer schools, workshops, and MOOCs as a lecturer. Her paper on legal rehabilitation of Dragoljub Mihailović in Serbia was selected for the Best Doctoral Student Paper Award in category Balkans by the Association for the Study of Nationalities in 2015.\n\nJelena’s most recent publications include: “(Trans)National Memories of the Common Past in the Post-Yugoslav Space”, in History and Belonging: Representations of the Past in Contemporary European Politics, edited by Stefan Berger and Caner Tekin (Berghahn Books, 2018), “Law as an Instrument and as a Mirror of Official Memory Politics: The Mechanism for Rehabilitating Victims of Communism in Serbia”, Review of Central and East European Law, 43(2): 232-51 (2018), and “To Each Their Own: Politics of Memory, Narratives about Victims of Communism and Perspectives on Bleiburg in Contemporary Serbia”, Croatian Political Science Review, 55(2): 89-111 (2018).\n\nJelena is currently conceptualising her postdoctoral research project on transnational Cold War history and teaching on the same subject at the undergraduate level as the Career Development Grant recipient at the University of Giessen. The postdoc project, under the title “When Red Turned Green Yellow: Ireland and Yugoslavia in the Emerging Cold War”, examines Ireland and Yugoslavia during the fascinating time when both countries had to define and re-define their state identities and negotiate their sovereignty and position in the global political order. The research contributes to national histories of Ireland and Yugoslavia by observing them through the lens of the Cold War that goes beyond the binary understanding of this period reduced to superpower rivalry. The project focuses on three themes: anti-communism and representations of socialist Yugoslavia in Ireland in the immediate postwar period; contact zones such as decolonisation, the Palestine question, and the UN peacekeeping missions; and on the story of two small states searching for their position. The project centres on the theme of state sovereignty in the Cold War, with Ireland still trying to negotiate post-imperial sovereignty after British rule and Yugoslavia establishing a unique form of socialist sovereignty outside the bloc.\n\nAs a 2019-20 Visiting Fellow at the Moore Institute, Jelena will be working with the Irish Newspaper Archive, focusing on the reception of the postwar trials in Yugoslavia in the wider context of Irish anti-communism and its religious dimension\n\nJustin Dolan Stover\n\nIdaho State University\n\nstovjust@isu.edu\n\nDr Justin Dolan Stover is Assistant Professor of Transnational European History in the field of Violence, War & Conflict at Idaho State University, and serves as Secretary to the American Conference for Irish Studies. He was conferred with a Ph.D. in history from Trinity College Dublin (2011), an M.A. in twentieth century Irish history and politics from University College Dublin (2005), and a B.Sc. in history from Central Michigan University (2003). His research examines the Irish Revolution, 1913-1923, which has framed his publications on a variety of subjects, and include, among other pieces, “Families, Vulnerability and Sexual Violence during the Irish Revolution,” in Perceptions of Pregnancy: From the Seventeenth to the Twentieth Century, ed. Jennifer Evans and Ciara Meehan; “Violence, Trauma, and Memory in Ireland: The Psychological Impact of War and Revolution on a Liminal Society, 1916-1923,” in Aftershock: Psychological Trauma and the Legacies of the First World War, ed. Jason Crouthamel and Peter Leese; and, “Redefining Allegiance: Loyalty, Treason and the Foundation of the Irish Free State 1922-32,” in A Formative Decade: Politics, Economics and Identity in Ireland, 1921-32, ed. Mel Farrell, Jason Knirck, and Ciara Meehan.\n\nHis current research explores the environmental history of the Irish Revolution. Specifically, the environmental impact of guerrilla war and counter-insurgency, localized destruction of property and agrarian conflict, and post-revolutionary landscape reclamation, compensation, and restoration. This work highlights how war damage transcended political, ideological, and class divisions throughout this period, affecting both urban and rural areas, and the roads, bridges, and communications infrastructure that connected them. Methods of destruction were as equally diverse. Trees were felled to block roads, houses and creameries were burned to intimidate enemies and disrupt the agricultural economy, roads were trenched and intentionally flooded, and fields were spiked to prevent grazing. In this sense, larger and more iconic incidents, such the 1916 Easter Rising, the sack of Balbriggan and burning of Cork City in 1920, though devastating, were outliers against much more frequent, low-scale rural and agricultural destruction. Post-revolutionary Ireland was slow to repair damaged landscapes, a fact that presented a nation politically transformed yet physically and socially unhealed. Elements of this work have appeared in Century Ireland; in Paris – Capital of Irish Culture: France, Ireland and the Republic, 1798–1916, ed. Pierre Joannon and Kevin Whelan; and as a podcast, “Toward an Environmental History of the Irish Revolution,” from a talk given at the Institute of Irish Studies Seminar, Queen’s University Belfast. With Dr Kelly Sullivan, New York University, he is editing a thematic issue of the journal Éire-Ireland on Irish environments, and is writing on political ecology in Irish nationalist literature for The Cambridge History of Irish Literature and the Environment.\n\nWhile in residence, Dr Stover will continue writing his first monograph, Enduring Ruin: Environmental Destruction and the Irish Revolution, 1916-23, which will benefit from the Moore Institute’s unique research space and collaborative atmosphere, and collections within the James Hardiman Library. Working with his sponsor, Dr Nessa Cronin, Centre for Irish Studies, Dr Stover also hopes to host one of NUI Galway’s Student Academic Skills Training Workshops, and lead an M.A./Ph.D. seminar on methods in Irish environmental history. Further afield, he hopes to meet with members of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, and the Irish Heritage Council, while also taking advantage to visit local sites of revolutionary violence where environmental destruction occurred.\n\nJyoti Atwal\n\nJawaharlal Nehru University\n\njyotiatjnu@gmail.com\n\nDr Jyoti Atwal is Associate Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. In 2017 she was also appointed as an Adjunct Professor, Department of History, Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Limerick, Ireland for a period of 5 years.\n\nShe has authored Real and Imagined Widows: Gender Relations in Colonial North India. New Delhi: Primus Books, 2016. Her area of interest is Indian women in the reformist, nationalist and contemporary perspectives; socio-cultural and religious aspects of women’s lives in colonial and post colonial India; women’s agenda and the nation; autobiographies of women and narratives of the personal and the political domains; politics of representations of gender relations in colonial India; entangled histories of Indian, Irish and British women. She is currently working on a biography of an Irish suffragette, Margaret Cousins (1878-1954). Besides a Masters level course on Women in Colonial India, she teaches an MA and MPhil lecture Course on Women in Ireland: Reforms, Movements and Revolutions (1840-1930) at JNU. In 2017 she received a grant of € 5,500 by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Government of Ireland.\n\nSince 2015 she is member of the Editorial Board of Women’s History Review ( Taylor and Francis, UK). She is also member of the Advisory Committee of India Study Centre Cork, University College Cork, Ireland. She is a member of the Advisory Committee of PINNACLE Project led by , Prof Deirdre Raftery at University Collge Dublin to examine the professional needs and career trajectories of women teachers in India and in Pakistan. She has been a Visiting Fellow at Triniy College Dublin, Dublin City University and University College Cork. In 2018 she delivered the second V V Giri Memorial Lecture at University College Dublin She has been collaborating for teaching and research with Dr Ciara Breathnach (UL), Dr Sarah – Anne Buckley (NUIG), Dr Conor Mulvagh (UCD), Dr Lidia Guzy (UCC), Prof Jane Ohlmeyer and Prof Eunan O’Halpin at TCD.\n\nDuring her Moore Fellowship she will work on Cultural Nationalism and Revivalism in Early Twentieth-Century Ireland and India. India and Ireland share a common colonial past. Both nations evolved methodologies of freedom struggle – varying from revolutionary tactics, to non-violent passive resistance against British control. However, another popular premises that India Ireland share is a literary legacy. While Rabindranath Tagore’s friendship with Yeats in the nineteenth century is well known to Irish and Indian scholars, some of the other significant connections have been ignored. She plans to look at theatre and music as important arenas of forging unity of purpose. She proposes that India and Ireland were both trying to identify symbols to create a national ideal in late nineteenth century. Theatre and music provided a fertile ground for this purpose. Through the Dublin life of James Cousins, W.B Yeats, Lady Gregory and Synge; and through exploration of early years of Abbey Theatre and Irish National Theatre Society, she plans to capture this synergy. The leaders of the Abbey Theatre also embodied vegetarianism and occult. There were regular readings of the Hindu text ‘Bhagawat Gita’ in Dublin circles and promotion of vegetarian restaurants. There has been no study to look at these interactions as potential arenas of forging nationalisms through esoteric universalism and anti-colonial politics. I plan to focus my time in NUI Galway on collections in the Abbey Theatre Digital Archives. I will also consult collections such as the Michael Cusack collection.\n\nShe shall be focusing on the poet and play writerJames Cousins, who was married to Margaret Elizabeth Cousins (co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League). They both moved to India in 1915 at the invitation of the Theosophist or a humanitarian worker or an anti colonial activist in India. Both were fiercelycommitted to voting rights campaign for women and other forms of public service; and most significantly they joined in the Gandhian challenge to colonialism after 1920s. The couple stayed in Dublin from 1902 till 1915 and actively participated in several sessions of occult and planchette writing with Yeats and his group. The politics of women’s voting rights (intertwined with British suffragettes) and anti-colonialism were the two main political agendas of the couple. She plans to submit an article to Irish Historical Studies on this work, and perhaps a similar publication in India. She will use the materials from the research conducted in NUI Galway to frame modules for Irish history course. She will wokr with Dr Sarah-Anne Buckley at the Department of History.\n\nKanchana Mahadevan\n\nUniversity of Mumbai\n\nkanchmaha@yahoo.co.in\n\nKanchana Mahadevan is Professor at the Department of Philosophy, University of Mumbai. She works in the areas of continental philosophy, political theory and gender studies. She also writes on interdisciplinary subjects such as aesthetics and film. Her special focus is care and decolonization. She has published in journals and anthologies, both nationally and internationally. Her book Between Femininity and Feminism: Colonial and Postcolonial Perspectives on Care (published by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research in collaboration with DK Printworld New Delhi in 2014) examines the relevance of Western feminist philosophy in the Indian context.\n\nShe has taught at the Department of Political Science & Centre for Ethics and Global Politics, Luiss University, Rome as Visiting Professor (April-May 2016) and Visiting Research Professor (April-May 2019). She was Justitia Amplificata Senior Fellow at Goethe University Frankfurt, Frei University Berlin and Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften, Bad Homburg (April, 2018 to May 18, 2018) working on the gendered dimension of the secularism debate in India and the Habermasian post-secular.\n\nIn her project at the Moore Institute she will be working on “Contemporary Indian Aesthetics: Philosophical Interventions”. This project focuses on contemporary Indian art practice through philosophy, gender and the politics of decolonization. Arthur Danto noted that contemporary art can accommodate diversity through its freedom from linear art history determined by the West. Moving beyond Danto, this project argues that such freedom enabled non-Eurocentric art practice in multiple geo-political and socio-cultural global contexts. The Indian context, for instance, demystifies art from stultifying formalisms through interpretations without being restricted to Danto’s cognitivism. Both contemporary Indian visual art and film offer multiple kinds of art practice that are distinctly Indian nevertheless. This project investigates the construction of the Indian art object, as different from the Western, both in form and content. It examines the extent to which diverse and yet related narratives of decolonization, nationalism and cosmopolitanism influence such a construct, which also has similarities with its Western counterpart. It discerns contemporary art practice as opening up an aesthetics in which interpretation, rather than direct perception are integral. This project explores the extent to which gender remains an absent-presence in philosophical theorizations of art, despite its explicit presence in Indian art practice.\n\nKathryn Laing\n\nMary Immaculate College, University of Limerick\n\nkathryn.laing@mic.ul.ie\n\nKathryn Laing lectures in the Department of English Language and Literature, Mary Immaculate College, University of Limerick. Her teaching and research interests are principally in late nineteenth-century Irish women’s writing, New Woman fiction, modernist women writers, periodical and print culture.

Recent and forthcoming publications include: ‘Hannah Lynch and Narratives of the Irish Literary Revival’, New Hibernia Review 20:1 (Spring 2016) and ‘An Outpour of Ink’: From the ‘Young Rebecca’ to ‘the most important signature of these years,’ Rebecca West 1911–1920 in Women, Periodicals, and Print Culture in Britain, 1890s-1920s: the Modernist Period, eds. Faith Binckes and Carey Snyder (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2019). Her critical biography, Hannah Lynch: Irish Writer, Cosmopolitan, New Woman, co-written with Faith Binckes, will be published by Cork University Press in May 2019.\n\nShe is the co-founder and administrator of the ‘Irish Women’s Writing Network (1880-1920) Network’, established in 2016 (https://irishwomenswritingnetwork.com). A co-edited collection with Sinéad Mooney, Irish Women Writers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century: Alternative Histories, New Narratives, will be published by EER (Edward Everett Root Publishers), in association with the Network, in 2019. She is also General Editor with Sinéad Mooney of two recently launched series to be published by EER: ‘Key Irish Women Writers’ and ‘Irish Women Writers: Texts and Contexts’.\n\nWhile at the Moore Institute she will start new work on late nineteenth-century Irish women writers and their literary and publishing circles. This research stems from a broader interest in the field of turn of the twentieth-century Irish women’s writing and it connects with the second part of her project at the Institute – developing the ‘Irish Women’s Writing (1880-1920) Network’ website. This was set up to facilitate connections and conversations between scholars and to develop a digital platform where information about research and publications on forgotten Irish women writers, forthcoming conferences and other information, can be shared. The aim is to continue development of the website, with the assistance of expertise in the digital humanities available at the Institute, creating a database for retrieved documents, out of print publications, archival material and more.\n\nMaeve Lydon\n\nUniversity of Victoria / Carleton University- Canada\n\nmlydon@uvic.ca\n\nMaeve lives on the traditional territories of the Coast Salish indigenous peoples in what is now called Victoria in British Columbia, on the west coast of Canada. Her Moore Institute research is called - Mapping our Common Ground in Ireland and Canada: The Power of Placenames, Local Knowledge and Community Mapping for Eco-Cultural Restoration and Decolonizing Landscapes. Focusing on the Tim Robinson Archive at NUIG , Maeve wants to research post colonial perspectives on placenames and maps and the politics of translation and cultural revival in Ireland. She wants to address its relevance and application to the Canadian context focused on placemaking, sustainability and the resurgence by Indigenous peoples to recover their own language, culture, land.\n\nAs in the Galway and Ireland of the 1930’s and continuing to the present time, Indigenous peoples and First Nations in Canada, increasingly supported by academia and the immigrant-settler population, are focused on transforming and 'de-colonizing' education and research cultures including revitalizing indigenous languages and ways of knowing and living. Maeve want to situate Robinson's own story and context and navigate how he \"found' \"lost' placenames and recovered forgotten histories associated with their ''origins'' , and to explore the impact of his work on local and regional communities. She will also explore how Robinson's work could be used in the use/ recovery/ retrieval of indigenous placenames and cultures of placemaking/community mapping in the pan-Canadian context while identifying points of convergence and divergence between the two nations.\n\nMaeve has published for both academic and community audiences and works in community-campus partnership and network -NGO development with a focus on participatory research and capacity building/training for sustainability and social-environmental justice. A longer term goal for the Fellowship is to increase scholar, student and community based research, projects and partnerships between Victoria/Canada and Galway/Ireland and their respective wild west coasts and vibrant communities, cities and campuses. Besides the research and writing an article Maeve will also give a workshop on community mapping, support the Community Knowledge Initiative (CKI) at NUIG and participate in the 7th EUGEO Conference on the Geography of Europe.\n\nThe daughter of Irish parents from Galway, Maeve works nationally as the coordinator of Community Campus Engage Canada based in Carleton University (Ottawa) and also with the University of Victoria and community groups /NGOs on sustainability projects and community - green mapping.\n\nMartin Hurcombe\n\nUniversity of Bristol, UK\n\nm.j.hurcombe@bristol.ac.uk\n\nMartin Hurcombe is Professor of French Studies at the University of Bristol, UK, and a specialist of early twentieth-century French political culture, history and literature. His PhD examined the French combat novel of the First World War, arguing that the experience of combat led to a fundamental shift in the way that a generation of French intellectuals experienced time and space and, consequently, the world around them, exploring the political ramifications of these experiences. It was published in 2004 as Novelists in Conflict: Ideology and the Absurd in the French Combat Novel of the Great War. His second book, France and the Spanish Civil War: Cultural Representations of the War next Door, 1936-1945 (2011), studied the extent to which the war beyond the Pyrenees served a utopian function for both the radical left and right in France, offering forms of social reorganisation and new models with which to oppose the French Third Republic. His interest in utopia as critical tool for examining the present and imagining the future is also evident in his most recent book, co-authored with Matryn Cornick and Angela Kershaw: French Political Travel Writing in the Inter-War Years: Radical Departures. He has also published extensively on twentieth-century French crime fiction and, most recently, on the memory of Nazi collaboration in three French, Norwegian, and Swedish crime novels. With Simon Kemp, he is the co-editor of the only study of the award-winning French crime writer Sébastien Japrisot (Sébastien Japrisot: The Art of Crime, 2009). He is also one of the founding editors of the Journal of War and Culture Studies.\n\nHis current project represents something of a departure from his interest in war and culture, however, whilst still combining his fascination with the political, historical, and textual. This new project explores the history of cycling literature in France. The relationship between a range of textual practices and cycling in France is a long and complex one. Moreover, writing about sport, and especially cycling, is a serious business for the French. This project traces the relationship between road cycling, the national and regional press, key authors and journalists (such as Pierre Chany and Antoine Blondin), and the impact of new media on the way that cycling is narrated. It explores ideas of national, regional and political identities as well as issues of class, gender and race. During his visiting fellowship, he will be working closely with colleagues from the research group Sports & Exercise: Attitudes and Representation.\n\nMirko Daniel Garasic\n\nLUISS University\n\nmdgarasic@fulbrightmail.org\n\nMirko D. Garasic is a Research Scholar at the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics and Human Rights where he is involved in a European Union’s Horizon 2020 Project (I-Consent) on improving the guidelines for informed consent. He is also a Visiting Professor in Neuroethics at IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca. He holds a Ph.D. in Political Theory from LUISS University, Rome -where he is an Adjunct Professor in Bioethics. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Tel Aviv University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Monash University. Since the beginning of his Ph.D., he worked in four continents and published in five: in 2009 he was a Visiting Scholar at the Ethox Centre, University of Oxford, while in 2010, he spent a semester at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. During his time in India he also collaborated with the Center for the Study of Ethics and Rights. In the following academic year, he was a Yale University and Hastings Center Visiting Scholar thanks to a Fulbright Scholarship. He participated in numerous international conferences and he has received various awards and grants. Among other venues, his work has been published in the American Journal of Bioethics, BMC Medical Ethics, Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy, Topoi and The Hastings Center Report. His first book Guantanamo and other cases of enforced medical treatment (Springer, 2015) has been extensively discussed by international scholars in the prestigious Journal of Medical Ethics.\n\nDuring his time at the Moore Institute, he will be working on a project concerning the new challenges and opportunities for informed consent and advanced directives specific to wearable robots. He will also give a talk on the need for regulation of cognitive enhancers.\n\nPatricia Plummer\n\nDuisburg-Essen University, Germany\n\nPatricia.plummer@uni-due.de\n\nPatricia Plummer is Professor of English and Postcolonial Studies at Duisburg-Essen University, Germany. Her publications, research and teaching focus on English literature and culture since 1700, on Orientalism, travel writing and religion, postcolonial literatures as well as gender and popular culture. She received her doctorate at Mainz University and was Invited Visiting Professor of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies at Koblenz University (2005); more recently she has held visiting research fellowships at The University of Sydney (2015), Australian National University (2016), and has been Visiting Professor at Macquarie University (2019) in order to conduct research on her ongoing project “Gender, Art and Theosophy”, which aims at reconstructing the life and works of the ‘forgotten’ Anglo-Australian painter and theosophist Louisa Le Freimann (1863-1956).\n\nPatricia Plummer is the author of a monograph on style in Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist (2003) and has, inter alia, co-edited volumes on women’s studies (Perspektiven der Frauenforschung, 1998) and feminist crime fiction (Frauen auf der Spur, 2001). She is a principal investigator within the DFG-funded research group “Ambiguity and Difference: Historical and Cultural Dynamics” (2019-2021; project: “Unveiling Orientalism: Ambiguity in British Discourse on Travel of the Long Eighteenth Century”).\n\nWhile at Moore Institute Patricia will focus on gender and popular culture. Her project “Detecting Women and Power in the 21st Century” is connected to and builds on research on innovations in the crime genre in terms of gender, race and indigeneity that she has carried out over the past two decades. Writers hailed as Irish ‘Queens of Crime’ such as Alex Barclay, Tana French, Niamh O’Connor, Louise Phillips, Jane Casey and Jo Spain all began publishing crime fiction in the 21st century. Similar waves of women’s crime writing emerged in the USA in the late 1970s and in Germany in the late 1980s – each inspired by feminist ideas in the wake of the Second Women’s Movement. Given that popular literature and culture reflect on social change and at the same time have the potential to challenge traditions and create new role models, Patricia is interested in finding out what prompted these authors to take to the genre so recently, how they adapt the genre to the Irish context and how they reflect on current debates, e.g. the Suffrage Centenary and the #MeToo-Movement.\n\nPippa Marland\n\nUniversity of Leeds\n\nP.J.Marland@leeds.ac.uk\n\nDr Pippa Marland is a Research Fellow in the School of English at the University of Leeds, working on the AHRC-funded ‘Land Lines: Modern British Nature Writing’ project. She received her PhD from the University of Worcester in 2016, where she was also a lecturer, with a thesis on ‘The Island Imagination’ – a study of the representation of ‘islandness’ in contemporary non-fiction. A significant section of the thesis was devoted to Tim Robinson’s Aran writings – Stones of Aran: Pilgrimage and Stones of Aran: Labyrinth – and, indeed, Robinson’s concept of the ‘good step’, a motif that runs through both volumes of the Aran diptych, lies at the heart of the research. She is in the process of preparing a book based on her PhD entitled Ecocriticism and the Island: Readings from the British-Irish Archipelago, due to be published in the Rowman and Littlefield series ‘Rethinking the Island’ series in early 2020. She is also working on a co-edited collection for Routledge – Walking, Landscape, and Environment , forthcoming in 2019. She has published widely on ecocriticism, new nature writing, ecopoetry, and archipelagic perspectives, and was recipient of both the EASLCE and the ASLE-UK and Ireland awards for Best Postgraduate Essay in Ecocriticism, for articles on W.G. Sebald and Kathleen Jamie, respectively. During 2019 she will be taking up a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship, also at the University of Leeds, studying the representation of farming in modern British nature writing.\n\nWhile at the Moore Institute as a Visiting Fellow, Dr Marland will be carrying out research on the Tim Robsinon archive in the James Hardiman Library, looking in particular at the way in which Robinson condenses and orders material from his extensive Aran notebooks and diaries into the final, complex and challenging form of the Aran diptych. She will be presenting her findings at a guest seminar for the Irish Studies Spring series at NUI Galway.\n\nSeán Murphy\n\nWestern Washington University\n\nSean.Murphy@wwu.edu\n\nDr. Seán Murphy is associate professor of medieval studies in the Department of Liberal Studies at Western Washington University, where he teaches courses on the cultural history of medieval Europe and the ancient Mediterranean, with particular emphasis on the history of relations between Jewish and Christian cultures and, separately, the history of erotics. A native of the State of Maine, Dr. Murphy earned his A.B., M.A., and Ph.D. at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He was a lecturer for three years at the University of Toronto, before moving to his current position in Washington State. Dr. Murphy has published widely on attitudes towards ancient Jewish law and imagined Jewishness in Christian cultures of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His published articles and chapters include focused studies of Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and William of Auvergne (d. 1249) and their respective contemporaries, as well as sustained studies of Christian concerns about “Judaizing” in theology and law.\n\nAs a 2018-19 Visiting Fellow at the Moore Institute, where he is affiliated with the Centre for Ancient, Medieval, and Pre-Modern Studies, Dr. Murphy will complete a book-length project that includes: the first-ever English translation (in fact, the first translation into any language) of William of Auvergne’s De legibus (On Laws); a corrected version of the 1674 Latin edition of De legibus; and an introductory essay and notes on William’s treatise. De legibus integrates a number of theoretical issues in the study of law and religion, including the relation between natural and revealed law, between law and virtue, and between literal and spiritual interpretation of the Bible; it also includes four chapters on the life and law of Muhammad. Fundamentally, De legibus is a study of the Law of Moses, its nature and purpose in ancient Judaism and in Christianity. William promotes, with significant qualifications, ancient Jewish law as a powerful remedy for contemporary Christian idolatry, a highly unusual position in the 13th century, when most Christian intellectuals rejected any literal interpretation and application of the non-moral commands of the Law. De legibus, then, is a crucial source for our understanding of how Christian constructions of Judaism, as well as Islam and paganism, developed in a period of deteriorating relations between Christians and Jews.\n\nIn addition to his work on William of Auvergne, Dr. Murphy, while at NUIG, will begin formal study of Old Irish and modern Irish, renewing an interest in Irish studies that began long ago when he worked as a professional archaeologist on the first excavations (1990) undertaken at King John’s Castle in Limerick City.\n\nDebapriya Basu\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Assam, India\n\ndebapriya.06@gmail.com\n\nProject Title in The Moore Institute: The Examinations of Anne Askew Online\n\nDebapriya Basu teaches English and literary studies in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, in Assam, India. Her doctoral research is on the printed writings of non-aristocratic sixteenth century women poets, namely Isabella Whitney, Anne Vaughan Locke and Anne Dowriche. Her other interest is digital humanities, specifically digital scholarly editing. Apart from involvement in several projects of digital archiving and hypertexts undertaken by the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) located at her alma mater Jadavpur University, she has taught modules in advanced text technologies at the SCTR’s postgraduate diploma course on Digital Humanities and Cultural Informatics. She was Project Supervisor in the 'Bichitra Tagore Online Variorum' (a variorum documentary digital edition of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's manuscript and printed writings in Bengali and English) and is a contributor in Bichitra: The Making of an Online Tagore Variorum (Springer, 2015), edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri. Her current work involves creating an electronic edition of the works of the English Protestant martyr Anne Askew (available at www.anne-askew.humanities.uva.nl), funded by an Erasmus Mundus fellowship to the University of Amsterdam and supported by IIT Guwahati's Start Up Grant Programme. She has contributed to the University of Edinburgh Institute of Advanced Studies in the Humanities' 'Dangerous Women' project (http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2016/09/16/anne-askew-2/) in this connection.\n\nAt the Moore Institute Debapriya looks forward to further exploring the possibilities of the electronic scholarly edition of Anne Askew’s texts. Her objective is to expand specific aspects of the pilot as the output of the second phase during the tenure of the Fellowship with input and ideas exchanged with colleagues at the Moore Institute. The Fellowship will enable her to go one step further in the conceptualisation and execution of an edition in which the primary texts are electronically malleable according to the reader’s needs without losing their structural identities, and the notion of the critical apparatus is examined and expanded to include a networked set of digital documents and tools to offer background and context. This will be achieved with support from the Moore Institute’s expert experience in innovations in digital humanities and the special collections of the Hardiman Library.\n\nJessica Pliley\n\nTexas State University.\n\npliley@txstate.edu\n\nJessica Pliley is an associate professor of the history of women, genders, and sexualities at Texas State University in San Marcos, TX. She earned her Ph.D. in comparative women’s history at the Ohio State University in 2010. She is the author of Policing Sexuality: The Mann Act and the Making of the FBI, published by Harvard in 2014, which examines the origins and implementation of the United States’ 1910 White Slave Traffic Act before World War II. She co-edited Global Anti-Vice Activism: Fighting Drink, Drugs and Immorality, 1880 – 1950 with Harald Fischer-Tiné and Robert Kramm (Cambridge, 2016). This collection of essays takes a global history approach to consider the role of regulation of bodily habits to colonial and state modernization schemes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her articles have appeared in the Journal of Women’s History, the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, and the Journal of the History of Sexuality, as well as several peer-reviewed edited collections. Dr. Pliley is an advisory board member of the AHRC-funded project, Trafficking Past: Exploring Sex, Work, and Migration in Modern History (https://traffickingpast.uk/), a network of feminist historians of sex work, migration, and gendered forms of labor that is meant to facilitate collaboration through a series of workshops and conferences and by providing a digital space for the exchange of ideas and sources. She is also the co-organizer of Yale University’s Working Group on Modern Day Slavery at the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition (https://glc.yale.edu/ModernSlavery/WorkingGroup), a two-year initiative that will culminate in an international conference in November 2018 and an edited book. Additionally, she is the book review editor of the Journal of Women’s History.\n\nHer area of research examines the intersections of migration policy and immigration, policing and law enforcement, and sex work and other forms of intimate labor. Her new book-length project, which is in the process of being conceptualized, will tackle the global story of anti-trafficking activism from the 1880s to 2000. She is also looking at how local communities along the US-Canadian border policed prostitution and enforced international anti-sex trafficking conventions.\n\nMáire Cross\n\nNewcastle University, UK\n\nm.f.cross@ncl.ac.uk\n\nThe Project Title in The Moore Institute: The influence of Ireland on the social investigator Flora Tristan (1803-1844).\n\nThe influence of Ireland on the social investigator Flora Tristan (1803-1844)\n\nMy research focuses through an interdisciplinary lens on nineteenth-century political ideas of the early nineteenth-century feminist socialist writer and activist, Flora Tristan (1803–1844).\n\nI wish to undertake an investigation of the Irish dimension present in a French thinker who is recognised as one of France’s key socialist feminists yet whose intellectual strength is still relatively unexplored. The aim of the study is:\n\n• to understand the style and scope of Flora Tristan’s knowledge of Ireland in relation to her contemporaries Daniel O’ Connell, Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont\n\n• to measure the influence of Irish affairs in a transnational setting of socialist and feminist activism\n\n• to establish the originality of Flora Tristan’s contribution to political thought as a result of her consciousness of the Irish experience.\n\nEducation:\n\nPhD: The Relationship between Feminism and Socialism in the Life and Work of Flora Tristan 1803–44, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, 1989\n\nMA (Distinction): Contemporary European Studies, University of Reading, 1976\n\nBA (Hons): West European Studies (II (i)), University of Ulster, 1975\n\nHaving worked as Professor of French Studies in the School of Modern Languages from 2005 until my retirement in 2017, I am continuing my research activities as an Emerita Professor. I am the Series Editor (with David Hopkin, Oxford) of the Manchester University Press Studies in Modern French History where we welcome proposals for publication from all parts of the world. I am supervising a PhD student and maintaining my links with the Newcastle Labour and Society History Group. My current research project is a double biography of Flora Tristan and her biographer Jules-L Puech. As the leading scholar of Flora Tristan studies with the first annotated translation of her journal and the first book ever published on her correspondence, I have published and presented papers in French History and in Gender Studies in a wide international community. I was President of the Society for the Study of French History from 2014 to 217. From to 2005 to 2013 I served as President of the Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France (ASM&CF) and was on the executive committee of the Association of University Professors and Heads of French from 2003 to 2013. I am a member of the editorial board of the journal French History and a trustee of the Society for the Study of French history (SSFH). 2015 saw my appointment to the positions of Head of Research of the Centre for Nineteenth-Century Studies (CNCS), Durham University, a position I held for 18 months.\n\nPublications: Cross MF.

Falsely attributed to Jerome, this text has been widely diffused throughout medieval Europe in more than 70 manuscripts dating from the 9th century onwards. Several of them are accompanied by illustrations depicting the biblical instruments.\n\nThis short letter raises many questions concerning its author, its date of composition, its sources, its influence on medieval iconography of musical instruments and its posterity. To answer all these questions, a critical edition based on all the known manuscripts is urgently needed. Over the past year, Dr Bisagni and I have begun to collaborate towards the production of such a critical edition. Thanks to a scholarship provided by the University of Picardy Jules Verne, where I am Maître de conférences (equivalent to senior lecturer) of Classical and Medieval Latin, Dr Bisagni spent the month of June 2017 in Amiens and we were able to discuss the project and plan the work ahead. As far as I am concerned, my main task consists in analysing all the copies of the text of which the Institut de recherche et d’histoire des Textes (IRHT-CNRS) in Paris has a microfilm. In particular, I am comparing these copies in order to establish the stemma codicum (the genealogical tree of these manuscripts). Moreover I am analysing the contents of the manuscripts in order to understand in which scholarly context the Letter to Dardanus was most frequently copied : biblical exegesis, allegory, or music theory. I am also trying to determine the exact relationship between the Letter to Dardanus and Rhabanus Maurus’ chapter on music, De musica et partibus eius, included in his encyplopedic work De mundo (On the World) written in 843. As there is no critical edition of De mundo, I must look at the 9th century Rhabanus manuscripts to find variant readings and possible indications of sources written in the margins of those manuscripts\n\nBio:\n\nSenior Lecturer (Maître de conférences) of Classical and Medieval Latin at the Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens.
