These and other questions are addressed by the recent Sulitest Survey. IAU is pleased to be amongst the partners in this project. Read about their findings and suggested types of engagement in #highereducation now! üìà Full report here: https://lnkd.in/gTacAJQK ‚¨á Read more below\n\nAttended my first EGOS (European Group for Organizational Studies) colloquium in Milan. Presented my work-in-progress with my co-author Sari. A pleasure to be part of this community. The dynamic relationship between organizations and sustainability are at the forefront of interests in academic research. There was a lot to learn as academics from over 90 countries showcased their current work and insights on time, innovation, and sustainability. Interesting discoveries of innovation and how time-related risks in sustainable actions impact organizations globally. There are many complex issues to be solved that require rigorous research and collaboration between academia and industry practioners in the critical transition towards a more sustainable economy. More so, the consequences of making (or not making) actions and their long-term impacts need transparency so that organizations can make informative decisions.\n\nTimes Higher Education's Impact Rankings are the largest and most comprehensive global university ranking dedicated to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The 2024 edition will be launching on June 12th at our Global Sustainable Development Congress (GSDC), in Bangkok, Thailand. The ranking has seen tremendous growth since its inception in 2019. Over 2,100 universities in 120 countries will be participating in the 2024 edition, a growth of over 350% since its first year. This is a testament to the important work that universities are doing towards achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (all universities participate voluntarily and for free). Furthermore, we are seeing the fastest growth in participation from universities in emerging markets including across Africa, ASEAN countries and LATAM, which is excitedly mirrored with dozens of top 10 performances across the SDGs, highlighting that excellence comes in many forms that traditional rankings often don't capture.

Professor Damien Page, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, branded it a \"big step forward for us as a university\", adding, \"not only will it guide us to becoming a truly research-rich university, it positions us as leaders in the field of inclusive research and knowledge exchange activity.\" Find out more about the strategy's three key areas of focus here üëá\n\nWe were privileged to welcome Dr Farveh Farivar from Curtin University in Australia as she generously shared her expertise in the Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (#fsQCA) approach during the seminar organised by our People, Work and Organisations Research Group at Northumbria University. In a remarkable display of knowledge, Faarveh not only expounded upon the theoretical foundations of this methodology but also provided illuminating empirical examples from her own research. Her presentation style was not only insightful but also immensely beneficial in imparting fundamentals of fsQCA, sparking enthusiasm among participants for incorporating this method into future projects. Among the participants, comprising both PhD students and academics, interactive discussions took place as some colleagues engaged with Farveh, exchanging valuable experiences in the practical application of fsQCA. This dynamic interaction facilitated a rich exchange of knowledge, fostering an environment ripe for potential collaborations among participants. Dr Farveh's presentation yesterday not only served as an educational opportunity but also laid the groundwork for the establishment of collaborative endeavours and the continued exploration of the fsQCA methodology in diverse research projects. #researchmethods #researchers #academicadventure #academicresearch #learninganddevelopment #learning #knowledgeexchange #knowledgesharing\n\nCalling all PRME signatory schools - It's rare that ICN Bachelor and Master students benefit from opportunities to speak to an international community on their research underway. PhD students have more opportunities. It's even rarer that Bachelor and Master students have opportunities to publish their work. PhD students have greater incentives and opportunities to publish their work however they often face rejections and multiple rewrites before succeeding to publish. Today all students are encouraged to integrate sustainability in their research. BBU is launching their 1st International Sustainability Student Conference on Friday April 26th. It's a fantastic opportunity for Bachelor, Master and PhD students who are already engaged in sustainability research to present their work underway in 15 minutes online in English to an international student and professor circle. The new deadline to submit a short abstract is April 8th.\n\nREF 2028: The RSE's and Young Academy of Scotland's vision for diverse and collaborative research culture. We have welcomed the opportunity to respond to the four UK higher education funding bodies‚Äô consultation on the proposed changes for the Research Excellence Framework 2028. https://lnkd.in/e5F2Yzn3 While Higher Education Institutions might address all the questions in the consultation, the response presented here concentrates on several topics that the RSE is best placed to address, which capture general cross-sectoral trends rather than reflect on the impact of proposed changes on individual institutions.
