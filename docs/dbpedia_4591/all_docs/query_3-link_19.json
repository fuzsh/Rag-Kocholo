        "text": "A range of Scottish business figures have been elected as the latest fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nAna Stewart, a technology entrepreneur, board member of the Scottish Football Association and founder of Pathways Forward - an initiative that helps women forge their way in business - joins the RSE fellowship.\n\nShe said: “Entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of our economy and we all have a part to play in shaping our society into one that welcomes all of our entrepreneurs through every stage of their journey, regardless of gender or background.\n\n“I look forward to working with other Fellows to help shape Scotland’s future in this endeavour.”\n\nGillian Docherty OBE has also joined the fellowship of the RSE. She is recognised as a leader in the field of data technology, and has worked to champion innovation, digital skills and community engagement with technology. She is the chief commercial officer of the University of Strathclyde, the chair of CodeBase and is the president of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.\n\nProfessor William Buchanan OBE, of Edinburgh Napier University, is a cyber security expert and computer scientist. Among a range of achievements, he has been the inspiration behind at least four university spin-out companies: Zonefox, Cyacomb, Symphonic and Memcrypt.\n\nHe commented: “It is such an honour to be acknowledged by an organisation which prides itself on recognising the finest scientific and technological minds in our country.\n\n“My love for innovation, research, and, especially, teaching will never leave me - I feel honoured to teach and research the topics that I care deeply about and to live and work in one of the most beautiful, cultured and educated cities on the planet.\n\n“Scotland is truly the best place in the world to build the future, and our four amazing cyber security spinouts are a testament to this.”\n\nAlso elected was Mike Welch OBE, president and chief executive of Treadsy and founder and chair of The Welch Trust.\n\n“Becoming a fellow is an incredible honour, and means I am following in the footsteps of two iconic figures to me,“ he explained. “Robert William Thomson, the Scottish inventor who dreamt up and patented the pneumatic tyre in 1847, in the very same street that we have our home in Edinburgh.\n\n“And Sir Tom Farmer, one of the world's foremost retailers of tyres, who mentored me and brought me to the great city of Edinburgh at the advent of the internet to build Kwik-Fit online.\n\n“Through their example and the privilege of becoming a fellow, I feel humbled and motivated to continue my work as an entrepreneur and philanthropist.”\n\nPatrick Macdonald, chair of the Institute of Directors, also joins this year’s cohort. An entrepreneur with a career ranging from the Ministry of Defence to leadership of companies such as John Menzies and Moneypenny, he also founded the School for CEOs.\n\nPresident of the RSE, professor Sir John Ball, said: “It is an immense honour to extend a warm welcome to each of our distinguished new fellows.\n\n“Individually, they embody exceptional dedication and accomplishment spanning multiple sectors and disciplines, collectively they demonstrate a profound commitment and determination to make meaningful contributions through their endeavours.\n\n“As Scotland’s National Academy, we remain committed to mobilising a diverse array of expertise to confront society's most pressing challenges, and I am certain that our new fellows will prove invaluable assets to the RSE.”\n\nAs well as achievements in business, new fellows are elected for their individual excellence in a wide range of fields such as physics, chemistry, informatics, literature, law and social sciences. They will be joining the 1,800 current fellows of the RSE.\n\nThe complete list of new Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh is as follows:\n\nHonorary fellows\n\nArmando Iannucci\n\nWriter and
