Among this number are not only scientists, but also those involved with the arts, humanities, social science, business, and public service.\n\nFellows have a fundamental role to play in the RSE’s aims of inspiring, engaging, and providing expertise.\n\nWe wish Professor Eddleston and Professor Patton every success in their new role within the RSE."
