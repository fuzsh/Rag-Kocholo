The fellowships enable researchers to access expertise, gain new perspectives and build long-lasting collaborative relationships.\n\nThis scheme is jointly run by the British Academy and the Royal Society.\n\nThe overarching aim of the Newton International Fellowship programme is to attract and retain emerging talent in the UK and build a globally connected, mobile research and innovation workforce. The objectives are to:\n\nAttract talented international early career researchers to establish and conduct their research in the UK\n\nSupport early career researchers to pursue high-quality and innovative lines of research\n\nProvide opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge through training and career development\n\nFoster long-term relationships through networking opportunities and the Newton International Fellowships alumni programme.\n\nApplications for the humanities and social sciences should be made to the British Academy.\n\nIf you are unsure about which academy to apply to, contact info@newtonfellowships.org.\n\nThe Royal Society recognises that diversity is essential for delivering excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Society wants to encourage applications from the widest range of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences to maximise innovation and creativity in science for the benefit of humanity. We regularly review and revise policies and processes to embed equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) principles in all aspects of the grant making process and ensure all talented applicants have an equitable chance to succeed as per assessment criteria.\n\nSee below for details of adjustments we can provide for disabled applicants.\n\nISPF-Funded and Privately-Funded Fellowships\n\nWe welcome applications from all countries.\n\nThe Royal Society also has funding through the International Science Partnerships Fund to support additional Newton International Fellowships for applicants applying from Switzerland.\n\nThe Royal Society’s partnership with the K C Wong Education Foundation also allows us to fund additional fellowships for applicants applying from China. These awards are termed Royal Society K C Wong International Fellowships.\n\nIt is not possible to apply directly for one of these fellowships. They are selected from the same pool of applicants as the Newton International Fellowships and are of equal value and prestige.\n\nChanges to the scheme\n\nFellowships awarded in the 2024 round will be two years in duration.\n\nWhat does the scheme offer?\n\nThe maximum award value will be £280,000 over two years.\n\nFunds can cover:\n\nbasic salary as set by the host institution and associated on-costs\n\nresearch expenses\n\nrelocation and visa costs for Newton International Fellows and their dependents (partner and children). The total grant cap may be exceeded to cover relocation/visa costs if this is well justified in the application\n\nestate costs and indirect costs\n\nFurther detail on these changes is available in the scheme notes and in our Royal Society Funding Guidance (costing policy)\n\nWe provide flexibility to accommodate personal circumstances including part-time working for health reasons or caring responsibilities. There is provision for maternity, paternity, shared parental, adoptive or extended sick leave, as well as financial support for childcare costs that arise from attending conferences and research visits.\n\nRoyal Society Research Fellows also have the opportunity to access a range of career development and engagement opportunities including training on leadership, science communication and public engagement, and activities coordinated by our science policy and schools engagement teams. For further detail on these additional benefits, read our opportunities page.\n\nSuccessful applicants may also be eligible to receive alumni funding to support continued networking activities with UK-based researchers following completion of their fellowship.\n\nThis scheme is for you if:\n\nYou have a PhD, or will have a PhD by the time the funding starts\n\nYou have no more than seven years of active full time postdoctoral experience at the time of application (discounting career breaks, but including teaching experience and/or time spent in industry on research)\n\nYou are based outside the UK\n\nYou do not hold UK citizenship\n\nYou are competent in oral and written English\n\nYour research is within the Royal Society’s remit of natural sciences, which includes but is not limited to biological research and biomedical sciences, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. For a full list, please see the breakdown of subject groups and areas supported by the Royal Society. Applications for the humanities and social sciences should be made to the British Academy.\n\nAll applications are developed with the support of a UK sponsor. The Sponsor should work with the lead applicant to develop the project proposal and should provide mentoring, support, and guidance throughout the duration of the award.\n\nApplicants can be of any nationality and those requiring a visa are eligible to apply for a Global Talent Visa under the fast-track process of endorsement.\n\nRead the scheme notes and FAQ for further information on eligibility.
