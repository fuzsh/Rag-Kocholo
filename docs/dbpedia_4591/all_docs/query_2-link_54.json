        "text": "The RSA’s values involve being open, optimistic, courageous, rigorous and enabling. This approach to life encourages inclusivity – welcoming new thinking and different perspectives – and respect for everyone. It helps to bring equality and equity to marginalised and underrepresented groups, including women.\n\nOur work is guided by more than just our values though. We stand on the shoulders of our Fellows (or members as they were known before 1914) and their achievements. As individuals they convene and collaborate to bring about meaningful positive change for people, place and planet.\n\nFemale Fellows have done, and are doing, amazing things to promote and foster gender equality in all areas of society. This might be through their work – whether it’s founding a charity tackling domestic abuse, establishing educational associations for women or being an international delegate for women – or simply by representing their gender and being seen as role models by aspiring women. Both can be equally inspiring.\n\nTo celebrate International Women’s Day 2024, we wanted to highlight just nine of the many thousands of female Fellows whose work has catalysed and continues to catalyse gender parity.\n\nAre you working to inspire inclusion? Perhaps you know another Fellow striving to reach gender equity for women? Share your insights and the efforts of others in the comments section at the bottom of this blog. But for now, find some inspiration in the following Fellows.\n\nSarah Mason\n\nChief executive and charity leader\n\nA Fellow since August 2023, Sarah Mason is Chief Executive of the Women’s Aid Federation Northern Ireland, having worked in various roles in the movement for more than three decades. The Federation provided specialist support to more than 7,500 women in the financial year 2022–23. She was made an MBE for services to women and girls in the 2024 New Year Honours List.\n\nBernardine Evaristo\n\nAuthor\n\nBernardine Evaristo is a British author and academic. Her books have been awarded ‘Book of the Year’ 60 times and her novel Girl, Woman, Other jointly won the Booker Prize in 2019, making her the first Black woman to claim the prize. She has received numerous honours and was made an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List in 2020. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2004, she became its president in 2022.\n\nMary Moser\n\nPainter\n\nMary Moser was a celebrated artist admired for her paintings of flowers. She won her first premium for a design from the Society aged 14. In 1795, Moser received another and was awarded the Society’s silver medal for ‘extraordinary merit’. The painting was displayed at the Society’s first art exhibition in 1760 and again in the ‘Exhibition of Exhibitions’ in 1951. At 24, she was one of two female founding members of the Royal Academy.\n\nMary Robinson\n\nFormer president of Ireland\n\nMary Robinson became the seventh president of Ireland in 1990 and served until September 1997. She was the first woman and the first independent to hold the country’s highest political office. Following her time as president, in 1997 Robinson became the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. She has received praise for her work in the fields of sexuality, contraception and gender equality."
