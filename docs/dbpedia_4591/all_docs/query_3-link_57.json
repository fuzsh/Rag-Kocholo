        "text": "The Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), Scotland’s National Academy, has announced its 2023 intake of Fellows, with several business leaders among the 91 new names.\n\nRobin Watson CBE, former chief executive of engineering consultancy Wood, was awarded a Fellowship for his services to business.\n\nHe stepped down from the role in 2022, after spending 10 years on the board, seven of which as boss.\n\nWatson commented: “The RSE has a long, rich and diverse history with a purpose which has endured, advancing learning and useful knowledge. In today’s challenging environment, this purpose appears more precious than ever, and I very much look forward to helping support the innovative thinkers of the future, as an RSE Fellow.”\n\nAlexander (Sandy) Begbie CBE, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, has also been made a Fellow.\n\nPrior to his current role, Begbie held several senior HR and transformation director roles in both financial services and the energy sectors - including Tesco Bank, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Aegon and Scottish Power.\n\nBegbie said: “I am thoroughly looking forward to actively contributing to the work the RSE, and specifically in areas where I have a particular interest, for example the economy and business, inclusion, social mobility and employability.”\n\nJackie Waring, an entrepreneurial Scottish angel investor, will also be joining this year’s cohort. With a track record of more than 30 years of advocacy for women's entrepreneurship, she has been an active advisor to governments, industry bodies and several high growth businesses.\n\nWaring has also founded Investing Women Angels, Scotland’s first all-female business angel group, and set up AccelerateHER, a network of female founders and partners.\n\nShe said: “I look forward to actively contributing to the organisation’s exceptional work in promoting economic and social progress building on the efforts of Investing Women Angels and AccelerateHER to inspire and support future generations of innovative thinkers.”\n\nProfessor Sir John Ball, RSE president, said: “It is a great privilege to welcome our new Fellows – they represent outstanding commitment and achievement at the highest level across a diverse range of sectors.\n\n“Harnessing our Fellows’ talents and ideas allows us to mobilise a wide range of expertise to tackle some of the most complex challenges society faces.”\n\nThe RSE’s current Fellowship of around 1,800 includes some of the greatest thinkers, researchers and practitioners working in or with Scotland today."
