        "text": "Open date\n\n11 July 2024\n\nClose date\n\n10 September 2024\n\nDecision by\n\n30 May 2025\n\nSee our tips for applicants to this scheme\n\nAbout the scheme\n\nThe University Research Fellowship (URF) programme aims to support the next generation of research leaders to undertake cutting-edge research. The objectives of the URF programme are to enable outstanding early career scientists with the potential to become leaders in their field to:\n\nBuild an independent research career at a UK university or research institution\n\nGain the freedom, time, and long-term flexible support to pursue high-quality and innovative lines of scientific research\n\nDevelop as research leaders by offering tailored high-quality professional development, networking and engagement opportunities.\n\nFellowships are for eight years, with years six to eight being subject to satisfactory progress demonstrated in a mid-fellowship review at the start of year four.\n\nThe Royal Society recognises that diversity is essential for delivering excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and wants to encourage applications from the widest range of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences to maximise innovation and creativity in science for the benefit of humanity. We regularly review and revise policies and processes to embed equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) principles in all aspects of the grant making process and ensure all talented applicants have an equitable chance to succeed as per the assessment criteria.\n\nSee below for details of adjustments we can provide for disabled applicants.\n\nChanges to the scheme\n\nHost Organisation Support – More detailed guidance provided to host organisations regarding expectations of their support for the applicant. From this round onwards, the Head of Department statement of support will be visible to applicants.\n\nWe recommend reading the information in full and contacting your host organisation Research Office in the first instance with any questions.\n\nWhat does the scheme offer?\n\nApplicants can apply for up to a maximum of £1.87 million over eight years.\n\nFunds can cover:\n\nContribution to the award holder’s salary\n\nIndirect and estate costs\n\nEquipment costs and research expenses including consumables, travel, etc.\n\nContribution towards research assistance salary and associated indirect and estate costs\n\nSupport for a new four-year PhD studentship(s)\n\nRelocation and visa costs for the applicants and their dependants (partner and children). The total grant cap may be exceeded in order to cover relocation/visa costs if this is well justified in the application.\n\nFull funding details can be found in the scheme notes and in the Royal Society Funding Guidance.\n\nWe provide flexibility to accommodate personal circumstances including part-time working, sabbaticals and secondments. There is provision for maternity, paternity, shared parental, adoptive or extended sick leave, as well as financial support for childcare costs that arise from attending conferences and research visits.\n\nRoyal Society Research Fellows also have the opportunity to access a range of career development and engagement opportunities including training on leadership, science communication and public engagement, and activities coordinated by our science policy and schools engagement teams. For further detail on these additional benefits, read our opportunities page.\n\nRoyal Society awards have made a significant impact on many researchers’ careers. Case studies from grant-holders can be found elsewhere on this page, or read an in-depth report on the careers of our alumni on our Career Pathway Tracker page.\n\nThis scheme is for you if:\n\nYou have between three and eight years of research experience, excluding career breaks, since the award of your PhD by the closing date of the round; please refer to the scheme notes for further detail about the review of career breaks\n\nYou do not hold a permanent post (including proleptic appointment) in a university or not-for-profit research organisation\n\nYou do not hold, or have not previously held, an equivalent fellowship that provides an opportunity to establish an independent research group and therefore independent researcher status\n\nYour research is within the Royal Society’s remit of natural sciences, which includes but is not limited to biological research and biomedical sciences, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. For a full list, please see the breakdown of subject groups and areas supported by the Royal Society.\n\nApplicants can be of any nationality and those requiring a visa are eligible to apply for a Global Talent Visa under the fast-track process of endorsement.\n\nRead the scheme notes or FAQs (PDF) for further information on eligibility. Those applying from Ireland (ROI) are funded by Science Foundation Ireland and will need to read the eligibility requirements in the SFI-specific scheme notes.\n\nPlease ensure that you meet all eligibility requirements before applying.\n\nYou will apply through our application and grant management system, Flexi-Grant®.\n\nSee the ‘Application and assessment process’ page for a general overview of the application and selection steps and below for details specific to this scheme.\n\nAssessment of your application will be overseen by one of our five Research Appointment Panels (Standing Committees) based on your research area:\n\nAi: Astronomy, cosmology, physics, earth sciences, environmental physical sciences & geosciences\n\nAii: Chemistry and engineering\n\nAiii: Pure and applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, communications and computer engineering; the mathematical aspects of astronomy, physics, cosmology, gravitation, theoretical physics\n\nBi: Molecular and cellular biology, zoology, plant sciences and physiology\n\nBii: Biomedical Sciences\n\nAssessment of your application will be overseen by one of the five Research Appointment Panels. Following eligibility checks, applications are initially assessed by a minimum of two panel members who have the most appropriate scientific expertise. A longlist is drawn up, with longlisted applications subject to independent peer review. Following completion of independent peer review, a shortlist for interview is drawn up with oversight from the Panel Chairs. At the end of the interview stage, the Panels will confirm the recommendations for funding.\n\nFurther detail on the application and review process is available in the scheme notes.\n\nThe Royal Society welcomes applications from disabled scientists and provides support and adjustments to ensure that they can participate fully in the selection process. If you require support or an adjustment when accessing the application form, attending interview, or for any other part of the application process, please contact the Grants team at urf@royalsociety.org or call +44 20 7451 2666. All requests for adjustments are made in confidentiality. Any request for an adjustment will not normally be shared with panel members unless it becomes relevant to the selection process itself. If we need to share your request with anyone (for example if panel members are required to implement any adjustments during interviews), we will ask for your permission first.\n\nAdjustments can include, but are not limited to:\n\nExtension of the deadline\n\nAdditional support to complete the application form\n\nReceiving the application form in a different format, such as on a Word document\n\nSupport during interviews as required, including technical support for candidates requiring accessibility software or services\n\nAdditional costs that candidates may incur on account of their particular disability to attend an interview.\n\nFor the University Research Fellowship, shortlisted applicants will be invited to an in-person interview at the Royal Society.\n\nThe aim of the interview is for you to demonstrate the importance and scientific validity of your work and for you to also describe how the award will lead to your scientific independence.\n\nIf you have further questions regarding the scheme, please see the FAQs, contact the Grants team on urf@royalsociety.org or visit our contact us page.\n\nCase study: Dr Amelie Saintonge\n\nCase study: Dr Andy Buckley\n\nCase study: Dr Asel Sartbaeva\n\nCase study: Dr Jon Agirre\n\nCase study: Dr Lauren Hatcher\n\nCase study: Dr Lynette Keeney\n\nCase study: Professor Rahul Raveendran Nair\n\nCase study: Dr Ross Forgan\n\nCase study: Dr Toby Cubitt"
