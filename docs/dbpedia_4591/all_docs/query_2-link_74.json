        "text": "The Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s National Academy, has announced its newly elected 2020 Fellows, comprising of leading thinkers and experts from Scotland and around the world whose work has a significant impact on our nation.\n\nThis new intake of 64 fellows, includes twelve University of Edinburgh academics, and they will join the current roll of around 1,600, representing the full range of physical and life sciences, arts, humanities, social sciences, education, professions, industry, business and public life.\n\nThose who are nominated, and then invited to join, have undergone rigorous assessment of their achievements, professional standing and societal contribution.\n\nFellows, who give of their time freely, play a fundamental role in enabling the RSE to deliver its mission ‘Knowledge Made Useful’, contributing to the cultural, economic and social well-being of Scotland and the wider world.\n\n“The diverse expertise and experience of our fellows, means that, as an organisation, we are well-placed to respond to the issues of the day with clear informed thinking free from commercial or political influence. Our new fellows, who we look forward to welcoming, not only hold vast knowledge but also deep experience, keen judgement, boundless enthusiasm and a passion for promoting societal development and change. By using their talents as a collective, we can often unlock or inspire new potential and unearth fresh solutions to some of the most complex issues Scotland’s society faces today.”\n\nProfessor Dame Anne Glover, President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\n\nThe list includes many leading academics, such as Professor Francisca Mutapi, a world-expert on global health and tropical diseases, and Professor Rosalind Allen, whose work contributions to our understanding of antibiotic resistance, but also includes a wide array of leaders from the arts, third sector, business and public life. These include Talat Yaqoob, a director at Equate Scotland, the national expert in gender equality throughout the STEM sectors, and an Equalities Consultant, who since 2016 has been leading work to change cultures in organisations and academia to encourage more women into male dominated fields.\n\nAlongside the 54 fellows and eight corresponding fellows, honorary fellowships have also been awarded to actor, producer, singer, author and activist Alan Cumming OBE and historian Niall Ferguson.\n\nView the full list of new Fellows elected in 2020"
