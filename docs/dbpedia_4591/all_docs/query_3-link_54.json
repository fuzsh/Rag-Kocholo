The Fellowship will provide me with an opportunity to work collectively and collaboratively with some of the greatest minds to solve the pressing issues of our times through innovative solutions for the greater good of mankind.”\n\nMazumdar-Shaw is among the 80 luminaries to be appointed to the RSE’s Fellowship this year."
