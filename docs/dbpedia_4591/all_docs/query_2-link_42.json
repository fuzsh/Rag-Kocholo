        "text": "Posted on: 30 March 2021\n\nAlan Irvine, Professor of Dermatology in Trinity’s School of Medicine, has been elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) in the 2021 list of honours just published by Scotland’s national academy.\n\nThose elected to the Fellowship have undergone a rigorous assessment of their achievements, professional standing and the contribution they and their work make to wider society.\n\nProfessor Irvine is a leader in dermatology and recently published new research that offers fresh hope for treating infants living with the common skin condition, eczema. You can read more about this work here.\n\nProfessor Irvine said:\n\n“I am hugely honoured to receive this acknowledgment from the Royal Society of Edinburgh. I have had many fruitful and enjoyable scientific collaborations with excellent Scottish scientists, especially with Irwin McLean in the University of Dundee. I look forward to driving future collaboration between Scotland and Ireland in the Life Sciences.”\n\nProfessor Dame Anne Glover, President of The Royal Society of Edinburgh said:\n\n“As Scotland’s national academy we recognise excellence across a diverse range of expertise and experience, and its effect on Scottish society. This impact is particularly clear this year in the latest cohort of new Fellows which includes scientists who are pioneering the way we approach the coronavirus; those from the arts who have provided the rich cultural experience we have all been missing, and some who have demonstrated strong leadership in guiding their organisations and communities through this extraordinary time.\n\n“Through uniting these great minds from different walks of life, we can discover creative solutions to some of the most complex issues that Scotland faces. A warm welcome is extended to all of our new Fellows.”"
