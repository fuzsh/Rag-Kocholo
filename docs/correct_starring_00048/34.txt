Mel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson (born January 3, 1956) portrayed Max Rockatansky in George Miller's three original films: Mad Max, Mad Max 2 and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.

Biography[]

Gibson's recollection of his audition for "Max" -- one he used to tell quite often -- was that he secured the role after he accompanied Steve Bisley (who went on to play Jim Goose) to the auditions. Although Gibson wanted to read for the audition, the tale told often states that Gibson was too bruised and bloodied from a previous night's brawl to recite the lines. Therefore, the casting director asked him to return in a fortnight for they were interested in roguish faces for the casting of the film's villains. However, when Gibson returned, his face had cleared up of bruising, which in turn showed-off his good looks to the casting directors. This in turn, according to Gibson, won him the role.

Many of the members involved in the casting have, however, dismissed Gibson's recollection as nothing but a tall-tale, insisting that his confidence and charisma were qualities that won him the role on the first day of auditions.

Mel Gibson's role as "Max" is often cited as his breakthrough acting role, and was the film that started his career within the film industry, the indie blockbuster making Gibson an internationally recognised face and icon.
