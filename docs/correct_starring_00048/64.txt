When Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga begins, audiences travel more than fifteen years before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road. Australian director George Miller decided to focus the prequel film on the character of Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron in Fury Road), and Furiosa audiences will surely find themselves completely swayed after the credits roll.

The movie stars Anya Taylor-Joy (Dune: Part Two) as the younger version of the heroine, with Chris Hemsworth (Thor: Love and Thunder) playing the villainous Dementus. Miller delivers some more top-tier character names in Furiosa, including Immortan Joe’s sons: Rictus, Erectus, and Scrotus. (No comment.) But the prequel is much more than a crazy-names generator. It contains massive action, car chases, and—of course!—countless murders out in the wastelands.

What Happens in Furiosa?

The story follows Furiosa from her kidnapping as a child to her rise as one of Immortan Joe’s best drivers. Along the way, she fights Dementus, the man who killed her mother and threatened to conquer her lost home. Thanks to her inventive mind and eagle-like eyesight, she survives countless near-death experiences to seek revenge against Dementus during his war with Immortan Joe. At one point, Furiosa even alludes to the fact that she’s saved by Mad Max.

In the end, Furiosa and War Rig driver Praetorian Jack destroy Dementus’s Bullet Farm. Jack is killed in the fight and Furiosa loses an arm, but she eventually gets her revenge. Chasing Dementus out into the wastelands, she shoots him in the back of the head and returns to Immortan Joe’s Citadel. There she visits Joe’s five wives and plans their escape. As they get into the War Rig together, the story line wraps up directly at the beginning of Mad Max: Fury Road.
