        "text": "Australian director George Miller made his feature film debut with MAD MAX in 1979. It’s a good-vs.-evil story about a patrol officer with plenty of grit and determination working to restore order in post-apocalyptic chaos.\n\nThe film had an unknown lead – American-born, Australian-raised Mel Gibson in his breakout role.\n\nSurprised and delighted by the film’s success, Miller released MAD MAX 2 (The Road Warrior), in 1981, again starring Gibson as the renegade hero with a penchant for leather, shotguns, and maximum horsepower. Thus, the Mad Max franchise was born.\n\n~~~~~\n\nIan and Andy, aka Secret Base Cinema, and curators of the September Mad Max double feature offered some quotes from critics Richard Corliss and Brian Eggert:\n\n“Mad Max is not a ‘people picture’. It is an action movie whose subject is machines, and the sophisticated killing machine man could become. The hardware is the star here: the souped-up Chevies and demon motorcycles, captured by Miller’s supple, fender-level camera — one machine in sync with another.”\n\n– Richard Corliss, Time Magazine\n\n“If the Mad Max canon as a whole is about anything beyond Miller’s kinetic energy and expert automobile stuntwork, it is about the protagonist losing his humanity and then regaining it again, and in that process establishing himself as a mythic hero. This ambition is quite efficiently achieved within The Road Warrior alone, which epitomizes the journey and mythology in a single, brilliant stroke.”\n\n– Brian Eggert, Deep Focus Review\n\nSee more info in the sections below:\n\nBrief Synopses\n\nEvent Details\n\nDrinks & Dining\n\nCult classics in their own right, both Mad Max 1 & Mad Max 2 set Mel Gibson on the path to stardom and they remain outstanding action adventures that audiences still love to watch.\n\nMad Max 1, the original, 1979\n\nIn a not-too-distant dystopian future, when man’s most precious resource — oil — has been depleted and the world plunged into war, famine and financial chaos, the last vestiges of the law in Australia attempt to restrain a vicious biker gang. Max (Mel Gibson), an officer with the Main Force Patrol, launches a personal vendetta against the gang when his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son are hunted down and murdered, leaving him with nothing but his instincts for survival and retribution.\n\nMad Max 2, Road Warrior, 1981\n\nAfter avenging the death of his wife and young son at the hands of a vicious gang leader, Max (Mel Gibson) drives the post-apocalyptic highways of the Australian outback, fending off attacks from nomadic tribes that prey on outsiders. Falling into an encampment led by the relatively peaceful Pappagallo (Mike Preston), Max at first schemes to steal their oil, but soon becomes the group’s reluctant defender against ruthless marauders.\n\n~~~~~\n\nIn addition to the Max Max series, director George Miller had further success directing a diverse array of films: The Witches of Eastwick, Lorenzo’s Oil, Babe and Happy Feet. Gibson meanwhile has starred in several prominent movies – The Patriot, Braveheart, Lethal Weapon, The Year of Living Dangerously and Gallipoli. He has also had success with writing and directing – Hacksaw Ridge, Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ, and Braveheart."
