He made his debut in Ridley Scott's 2001 war film Black Hawk Down. Hardy's other notable films include the science fiction film Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), the crime film RocknRolla (2008), biographical psychological drama Bronson (2008), science fiction thriller Inception (2010), sports drama Warrior (2011), Cold War espionage film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), crime drama Lawless (2012), drama Locke (2013), mobster film The Drop (2014), and the biographical western thriller The Revenant (2015), for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He also portrayed Bane in the superhero film The Dark Knight Rises (2012), \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky in the post-apocalyptic film Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), and both Kray twins in the crime thriller Legend (2015).\n\nHardy's television roles include the HBO war drama miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), the BBC historical drama miniseries The Virgin Queen (2005), ITV's Wuthering Heights (2008), the Sky 1 drama series The Take (2009), and the BBC British historical crime drama television series Peaky Blinders (2013).\n\nHardy has also performed on British and American stages. He was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his role as Skank in the 2003 production of In Arabia We'd All Be Kings, and was awarded the 2003 London Evening Standard Theatre Award for Outstanding Newcomer for his performances in both In Arabia We'd All be Kings and for his role as Luca in Blood. He starred in the 2007 production of The Man of Mode and received positive reviews for his role in the 2010 Philip Seymour Hoffman-directed play The Long Red Road.Hardy starred in four films in 2015. The first, Child 44, set in 1950s Soviet Russia, saw him playing Leo Demidov, a Soviet secret police agent who investigates a series of child murders. Despite mild praise for his acting, Child 44 was reviewed negatively by critics and was a box office failure. Hardy then played the title character, Max Rockatansky, in 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. His performance was praised by critics and overall the film received critical acclaim and became a box office success. As of July 2015, it has grossed $366 million against a $150 million budget, becoming the highest grossing film in the Mad Max franchise\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2001 Black Hawk Down Spc.
