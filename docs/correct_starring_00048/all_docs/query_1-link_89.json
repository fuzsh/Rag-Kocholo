        "text": "Mel Gibson's back on the red carpet! The original Mad Max star made an unscheduled appearance at the Mad Max: Fury Road premiere in Los Angeles on Thursday, May 7, when he showed up to lend his support to the newest creation in the movie franchise.\n\nGibson, 59, who has been a somewhat controversial figure over the past few years, joined British actor Tom Hardy, who portrays the Mad Max character in the new movie, on the red carpet, and reconnected with the films' creator George Miller.\n\nMiller, who directs the latest Mad Max movie, was also the man behind Gibson's original 1979 film which catapulted the Australian actor into the spotlight.\n\nGibson's late, unexpected arrival at the TLC Chinese Theatre resulted in crazy cheers from the fans who lined the red carpet at the Hollywood venue.\n\n\"Mel was on fine form,\" a premiere-goer told Us Weekly. \"Slapping backs, hugging people, laughing and generally looking thrilled to be there.\"\n\nAnd while Hardy (the new Mad Max), was nervous of filling Gibson's shoes when he first won the role, the actor told Us at last night's premiere that he was delighted by his unexpected guest.\n\n\"It’s great to have Mel here,\" Hardy, in Alexander McQueen, told reporters. \"I didn’t expect him to come. When I got the part, it was good, but suddenly it struck me, \"Oh, sh-t, everybody loves Mel. And I’m the new kid, and they’re going to hate me. So I suck already and I haven’t even started'\" the 37-year-old actor said.\n\n\"So that was a concern. George created Mad Max with Mel, [he's] synonymous [with the role]. I’ve just inherited the legacy. And it’s my job just to turn up and do as he asks. I’m a different person to Mel. But at the end of the day, it’s George’s further development of his imagination with this character,\" he added."
