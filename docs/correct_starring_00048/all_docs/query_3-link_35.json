        "text": "Few Tasmanians, let alone teenagers, have had the chance to perform in a Hollywood blockbuster and walk the red carpet alongside the likes of actor Chris Hemsworth.\n\nBut Spencer Connelly, from Tasmania's north-west, recently did exactly that at the Sydney premiere of Furiosa, the latest instalment in the epic Mad Max film saga.\n\nSpencer had auditioned for a role as an extra in the action movie, but director George Miller was so taken by him at his audition that he cast him in a speaking role.\n\nThe 16-year-old has only recently been able to tell friends about his movie role, which is set to be one of the year's biggest Hollywood films.\n\nFuriosa has a reported budget of USD$168 million (approximately AUD$252 million).\n\n\"I'm still a young kid. I want to be able to tell people what I'm doing in life.\"\n\nHis mum, Alison McGee, helped enforce the non-disclosure agreement they signed.\n\n\"I was really excited for Spencer, [but] I couldn't say anything to anyone, not even my closest friends.\"\n\nChance encounter helped seal Spencer's dream of acting\n\nThe opportunity came about when Spencer and his older brother Fletcher were at a camp run by the Kids Foundation, which works with traumatised children.\n\nThe brothers are survivors of horrific domestic abuse.\n\nIn 2012, when Spencer was five and his brother nine, their father set them alight inside a car in Burnie. He is now serving a sentence in jail for their attempted murder.\n\nThe foundation has been involved in the brothers' recovery since they left hospital, with chief executive Susie O'Neill central to Spencer landing the role.\n\nMs O'Neill said during a make-a-wish type exercise at one of the camps a few years ago, Spencer listed a goal which was a bit out of left field.\n\n\"The young people write down the top three things that they want to achieve in the next 12 months, or a wish [they] may like to come true,\" she said.\n\nThis dream proved a little bit harder to wrangle, but after hitting a couple of dead ends Ms O'Neill had a chance encounter at a Victorian health retreat with the owner of land where part of the Mad Max movie was being filmed.\n\n\"He said, 'I've got an extra part and I'm going to give it up for him',\" Ms O'Neill said.\n\nMs O'Neill immediately asked for the casting director's details, and from there was able to get the attention of Mr Miller himself.\n\n\"Spencer went and auditioned and he was that good he got a speaking part.\"\n\nDetermined to not be defined by trauma\n\nSpencer plays one of the 'war boys' in the film, a group of young, cancer-ridden half-lives who Mad Max buffs would remember as the henchmen of Immortan Joe from the series' 2015 instalment Fury Road.\n\n\"I walked a lot … I stood still a lot. I had to be told by George Miller where I had to look,\" Spencer said.\n\nSpencer said he loved his character and the opportunity it gave him to follow his dreams and make some lifelong friends in the business, including Australian actor and singer Sean Millis.\n\n\"It's just special to know that there's a lot of care when you make those friendships.\"\n\nBack home in Devonport, having rubbed shoulders with some of Hollywood's elite, Spencer is slotting back in as a regular Tasmanian teenager, going tenpin bowling with friends and attending drama class at Don College.\n\n\"I'm just a normal teenager. I'm inspired by being around those people who want to do the same things I want to do.\n\n\"It's just what I love.\"\n\nAnd, although it's all under wraps right now, Spencer hinted that he may have other big-screen opportunities coming his way in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAnd for Ms O'Neill, who accompanied him on the red carpet in Sydney earlier in May, she's just happy the Kids Foundation has been able to help another child avoid being defined by their trauma.\n\n\"After seeing the movie at the premiere look, it could go anywhere. So maybe he will become an international star,\" she said.\n\nLoading"
