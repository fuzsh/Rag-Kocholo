        "text": "Before the film's release, here's a quick primer to catch you up to speed on Max.\n\nWho exactly is this Max and why is he \"Mad\"?\n\nIn a dystopian crime-ridden world, Max Rockatansky was part of a police force holding criminals at bay.\n\nAll of that changed at the end of the first film.\n\n*Warning* Some spoilers ahead *Warning*\n\nHe resigned from his job after his partner Goose was left for dead by a mad motorcycle gang. After his wife and infant child were killed in the movie's climax, Rockatansky essentially went mad.\n\nThere's no other word for it.\n\nHe hunted down the rest of the gang, plucking them off one by one until they were all dead. He even handcuffed the final guy to a wrecked car that was about to blow. Instead of killing him outright, he left him with a hacksaw to attempt to cut through either the cuffs or his ankle before leaving him for dead.\n\nMax is a man living on the edge. He has nothing to live for, yet he somehow always ends up getting mixed up in an adventure where he's called upon to save a group of defenseless people. Don't mistake him for a hero — he's no Superman, but he's not a villain either. You could probably categorize Max under a group of antiheroes or reluctant savior.\n\nHow many films are there?\n\n\"Fury Road\" will be the fourth film in the franchise.\n\nThe other three are the original \"Mad Max\" (1979), \"Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\" (1982), and \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985).\n\nDo I need to see them before checking out \"Fury Road\"?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThough Miller told The Hollywood Reporter that all of the films are \"connected in spirit,\" \"Fury Road\" stands on its own. Since the film's pretty light on plot (and dialogue), focusing more heavily on the visuals and action, you'll be just fine.\n\nThe introduction of Tom Hardy taking over as Max is sort of a passing of the torch.\n\nThink of \"Fury Road\" as a completely new James Bond installment with a new actor stepping in to play the role. He has a new agenda and different missions to carry out. Likewise, this is an entirely new adventure in the world of \"Max.\"\n\nSo, why's the newest one coming out now — years later? Seems like an awful long time to wait for another sequel.\n\nMiller has been trying to bring \"Fury Road\" to screen for 15 years, but it has been delayed several times and has even swapped studios.\n\n\"When 9/11 happened, the American dollar collapsed against the Australian dollar, the budget ballooned, and it fell apart,\" Miller explained to THR. \"So we had to move on to Happy Feet because the digital unit doing that was ready, and Warners said, 'Let’s go.'\"\n\nWhen the film was at Warner Bros., it was originally set to film in Australia, like the previous installments, however, an unusually heavy rain storm set the film back 18 months. Finally, production moved to Africa.\n\nAnd why isn't Mel Gibson reprising his role as the lead?\n\nMiller originally wanted him to return, and he was just about onboard when there were original talks for the film in 2000 and 2001; however, as delays for the film went on, two concerns came up."
