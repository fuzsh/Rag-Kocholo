        "text": "George Miller returns triumphantly to theaters this Memorial Day weekend with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth in the fifth installment of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi action saga, and a restart of the series for anyone who hasn’t seen it before — or anyone who saw the brilliant Mad Max: Fury Road and wants more of that.\n\nBudgeted about the same as its predecessor Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga — from cowriter-director George Miller and cowriter Nico Lathouris — enters a thus-far soft summer movie season.\n\nMay starter The Fall Guy did a face-plant, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is unfortunately likely to finish below $400 million and might top out at around $320 million, depending on how things go. Family fantasy release If is underperforming too, while biopic Back to Black is doing only modest business.\n\nNow, it appears Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is going to underperform as well, coming in well below the domestic $40-45 million projections ahead of summer. Furiosa appears headed for a finish barely north of $30 million in North America for the long Memorial holiday weekend.\n\nForbes'Planet Of The Apes' Sequel Rules Domestic Box Office With $58 Million\n\nUnless international markets work some serious magic and the film enjoys a surge of late-comers seeking premium seats, Furiosa is going to be yet another big-budget studio franchise sequel/prequel facing box office failure. Perhaps a PG-13 rating would’ve helped, and this is after all a franchise whose last installment was nine years ago (2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, which wasn’t a blockbuster despite being widely acclaimed).\n\nAlthough it’s worth noting that last year saw an R-rated period biopic about a scientist become a nearly $1 billion summer blockbuster (Oppenheimer), so there’s only so far down that road we can go in explaining why Furiosa isn’t generating audience interest.\n\nFuriosa’s B+ Cinemascore is also indicative of the sort of mixed audience reactions that don’t bode well for word of mouth going forward, when a film already opens this low and shows such lack of public awareness or interest.\n\nForbes'The Fall Guy' And 'Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes' Launch 2024 Summer Movie Season\n\nWhich is all a shame, because Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is a fantastic, complex character story with an immensely engrossing and thrilling plot filled with spectacular action set pieces and cheer-out-loud moments.\n\nFuriosa is a more than worthy successor to Fury Road, delivering everything we loved about that film but with a surprisingly more detailed plot, more supporting character subplots, a look (finally) at the early days of the end of the world, and just the right touch of satire to make it feel at once like the rightful heir to the franchise and yet also like a whole new animal within the world of Mad Max.\n\nIt’s also delightful, powerfully told on-ramp for new viewers, and I promise you it won’t let you down. This is an origin story and an introduction to one of the coolest, most influential post-apocalyptic sci-fi aesthetics of all time. If you’ve seen gun-toting car-jacking punk and heavy metal gangs roaming a post-apocalyptic hellscape in video games, comics, movies, or music videos, they probably got it from Mad Max movies — or they got it from something else that was inspired by Mad Max.\n\nAnd Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, like Mad Max: Fury Road before it, represents the top-tier embodiment of all of those influences and ideas. George Miller is in peak performance, operating at the top of his game after having dramatically upped that game in the past decade-plus.\n\nForbes'Dune: Part 2' On Course For $700 Million Worldwide Box Office Finish\n\nThe ambition and audacity on display at every turn makes Furiosa radically unique alongside the year’s other grandest displays of artistic vision, including Dune: Part II. Miller hasn’t merely recaptured lightning in a bottle, he’s released lightning from the bottle directly into our veins.\n\nThere are glimpses of both the past and future — what was left of the world’s beauty before the last of the deadly invisible radiation made its way far enough to poison the last gardens, and even Max himself in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo foreshadowing the inevitable collision of his world and Furiosa’s.\n\nThe cast are superb, especially Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa. While it was disheartening to hear Charlize Theron wouldn’t return in her role from Fury Road, it was also understandable to do an origin story and it’s hard to complain about Taylor-Joy’s layered, driven, and mesmerizing lead performance. It feels like you’re watching the same character, and is never distracting — including due to the fantastic performance by Alyla Browne as a much younger Furiosa.\n\nI thought I’d be bothered by Chris Hemsworth’s makeup (presumably to make him less recognizable?) but it’s such a good character and wonderful performance that you won’t notice or care. Likewise the rest of the ensemble deliver the goods, above and beyond anything you’re used to in the genres. This is a whole world, everyone in it has lived a life, and it shows.\n\nI don’t want to say much of anything about the plot, or even about the action sequences and chase scenes that each find new ways to blow your mind, other than that it all works. If I feared Miller might have rung a bell with Fury Road that would be hard to ever ring again, I was obviously mistaken. That he found a new way to ring it, yet within everything we recognize and loved already from the previous film, makes it all the more surprising and exciting.\n\nUnfortunately, I doubt we’ll see the same rallying around Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga that we saw when Fury Road took everyone’s breath away and earned Oscar nomination including Best Picture, because Furiosa isn’t quite as surprising as the previous film — we know now that this is possible in the franchise, so rather than coming out of nowhere Furiosa proved it wasn’t a one-of moment of genius. Still impressive, still fabulous, still offering plenty new and different, but not that “holy smokes, where did this come from?” moment of awe.\n\nIt shouldn’t and doesn’t require that moment, mind you, but I think that’s why Furiosa won’t get the same loud following and promotion we saw for Fury Road.\n\nI hope audiences decide to defy current expectations and estimates, and show up for Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. Because I think most viewers will enjoy it immensely, and will agree that it’s definitely one of the films this year deserving a premium theater experience."
