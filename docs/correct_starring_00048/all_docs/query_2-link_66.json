        "text": "Mad Max- Fury Road Movie CLIP - Attacked (2015) - Tom Hardy Post-Apocalypse Action Movie HD\n\nMad Max, the 1979 movie, was made on a shoestring budget of $350,000 and was full of brand new actors - including Gibson. Director George Miller couldn't afford to hire professional actors at the time so held some local auditions for people to join in with his post-apocalyptic adventure movie.\n\nBut Gibson did not even intend to audition for the upcoming movie. Instead, the casting crew forced him to stick around and get his photo taken.\n\nGibson recalled the story in the special features of the Mad Max Collector's Edition Blu-ray. He told fans: \"I dropped a friend off because he'd been called into an audition. I drove him, dropped him, and waited for him in the waiting room with the girls at the casting agency - but I had had a very bad weekend.\"\n\nThe young actor, who was just 23-years-old at the time, was apparently as boisterous as ever. The American-Australian star revealed he \"got into a brawl\" the next before. And it didn't go well for him.\n\nGibson explained: \"I didn't come out looking too pretty. I took on half a rugby team and it just... it didn't work out too well on my end. So I was looking pretty bad.\" But this eccentric look was just what Mad Max bosses were looking for. He added: \"They took polaroids because I was - really - every colour of the rainbow, and they put them up, and they said: 'Man, we need freaks in this film! When you heal up come and see us.'\"\n\nGibson did as he was told, and it went extremely well for him.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Hardy James Bond hopes at risk after 'on-set aggression' outed?\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It could have been a commercial for a toilet cleaner and I would have gone for it to earn a buck!\"\n\nTwo weeks later Gibson returned to the audition process and he was met with an unexpected response. They asked him: \"And you are?\"\n\nPointing at the photo of himself covered in bruises, he replied: \"That's me on the wall!\"\n\nAfter realising who he was, Gibson said they quipped: \"Oh my god!\" before arranging a meeting with him and Miller.\n\nDON'T MISS...\n\nTom Hardy James Bond hopes at risk after 'on-set aggression' outed?

And he said: 'Can you memorise this?'\"\n\nThe actor was handed a two-page document filled with dialogue, including a big emotional speech. With a smirk, Gibson replied: \"Yeah, sure!\" He continued: \"I went out of the room and just kind of got the gist of what it was and I came out and, kind of, ad-libbed what I could remember. And I guess they bought it.\"\n\nThis wasn't the only radical event that took place during the filming of Mad Max.\n\nMiller could not afford to hire enough real actors, so he brought on members of an actual biker gang to fill out some of the iconic chase scenes through the Australian deserts. Some of these bikers could not even be paid, so Miller would instead reportedly pay them with beer.\n\nUltimately, Mad Max earned a staggering $100 million at the box office. Gibson was reportedly paid just $10,000 for his role.\n\nSOURCE / SOURCE"
