Without his creativity and dedication, we wouldn't have this legendary franchise to discuss. üåç\n\nMoreover, thinking back to the first \"Mad Max\" film, the antagonist Toecutter, played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, played a huge role in highlighting Mel Gibson and bringing him to the forefront. Hugh's brilliant portrayal of Toecutter was crucial; Mel Gibson's character, Max, didn't speak much and was primarily action-driven, reacting to Hugh's performance. This dynamic helped the audience get behind Mel Gibson's character as Mad Max. üí•\n\nArguably, the combination of George Miller's vision and Hugh's brilliant portrayal launched Mel Gibson's career. So, while Mel Gibson's contribution is significant, the true creator and driving force behind Mad Max is George Miller. üé•\n\n#MadMax #GeorgeMiller #FilmHistory #IconicRoles #MovieLegends\".",
