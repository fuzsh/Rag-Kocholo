        "text": "The film even landed at number six in my top 10 that year, two spots higher than the movie that beat it for best picture. I’m always happy to be wrong about a movie I thought I would dislike.\n\nOf course, when Hollywood has a hit, it can’t leave well-enough alone. So, we have “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” a prequel to “Fury Road” that’s everything I feared its predecessor would be. It’s a mechanical exercise that lacks suspense, is too long (at 148 minutes, it’s the franchise’s lengthiest film), and is so chockfull of exposition that I took more notes than I’ve done in years.\n\nThe majority of this origin story for Furiosa is not only unnecessary, it’s nowhere near as captivating as the earlier film. Why did I need such detailed explanations for a character whom Miller and Theron had previously embodied with such glorious mystery and pathos? Why show a world whose loss Theron already conveyed in that iconic shot of Furiosa kneeling in the sandstorm?\n\nI long for the days when I didn’t have to be told every damn thing about a movie character or event. Perhaps I am burned out by prequel-itis, but “Furiosa” felt like Miller and his co-writer Nick Lathouris were playing a convoluted game of connect-the-dots to sync up with the plot of “Fury Road.” You can practically hear them asking questions like, how do we get Furiosa’s arm ripped off? How does she get to Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme)? What does the Green Place look like, and how do we get her out of it?\n\nThere’s also an overdone sense of bleakness that stops being effective and becomes laughable in its demands to be taken seriously. You can’t have characters named Scrotus (Josh Helman) and Pissboy (Darcy Bryce) and simultaneously aim for Merchant-Ivory levels of gravitas.\n\nPlus, we already know Furiosa will survive this film, so there are no stakes to concern us. We also know Immortan Joe, who isn’t the main villain here, will emerge unscathed. Despite its exciting action set pieces, all of which show Miller’s unmatched, preternatural skill at staging motor vehicle-inspired chaos, “Furiosa” drags for much of its runtime.\n\nThe first hour is the most compelling and promising, with Alyla Browne giving a fantastic performance as young Furiosa. Remnants of the Feral Boy character from “The Road Warrior” are in young Furiosa’s DNA, and Browne burns with a similar intensity. When she’s told by this film’s antagonist, Dementus (Chris Hemsworth), to look away as a man is drawn and quartered, young Furiosa stares head-on, as if she’s storing this heinous act of brutality in a keg of fury she’ll one day tap.\n\nBefore she’s placed in Dementus’s care, Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place, the one part of this apocalyptic world that’s capable of plant life. “Furiosa” equates this area with Eden, complete with a shot of someone picking fruit from a tree. Biblical allusions are just one ingredient thrown into Miller’s gumbo of inspiration — Furiosa’s mom (Charlee Fraser) is even named Mary — but expect to see hints of Arthurian legend and even “Ben-Hur.”\n\nIn her small role, Fraser is the most memorable badass in “Furiosa.” Chasing her child’s kidnappers into the desert wastelands, she splatters a large amount of bad guys across the sand before meeting a horrific demise in front of her daughter. If Furiosa has a motivation as she grows into adulthood, it’s to avenge her mother’s death.\n\nJust as she does in this review, Anya Taylor-Joy shows up in “Furiosa” later than you’re expecting. Her adult version of Furiosa doesn’t appear until almost an hour into the film. Caught between the memorable groundwork laid for her by Browne and the future of her character left by Theron, Taylor-Joy has big shoes to fill and, unfortunately, she can’t fill them.\n\nSince Furiosa is a woman of few words, Miller focuses a lot on Taylor-Joy’s eyes to convey her inner thoughts, but there’s nothing there. Even in what should be her biggest scene in the film, she is thoroughly upstaged by Hemsworth giving an endless monologue that serves as “Furiosa”’s thesis statement.\n\nDementus is the perfect name for Hemsworth’s wannabe deity character; to convey madness he chews so much scenery he becomes Kenneth Branagh with muscles — he’s Kenneth Brawnagh. Dementus dons a pointy beard and drives a Roman-era chariot that’s pulled by motorcycles instead of horses. Though exhausting, he keeps things interesting whenever he’s onscreen.\n\n“Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” opens with an intriguing quote: “As the world forms around us, how do we brave its cruelties?” Unfortunately, Miller and his Mad Max series have already answered that question with four excellent prior installments, making this film’s response ring hollow.\n\n★★½\n\nFURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA\n\nDirected by George Miller. Written by Miller and Nick Lathouris. Starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Alyla Browne, Charlee Fraser, Lachy Hulme, Darcy Bryce, Josh Helman. At AMC Boston Common, Landmark Kendall Square, Alamo Drafthouse Seaport, AMC Causeway, suburbs. 148 minutes.
