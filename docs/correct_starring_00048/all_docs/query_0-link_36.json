Some viewers may also be disappointed at the heavier reliance on CGI this time around, given Fury Road’s much-celebrated focus on practical stunts and effects, though the reality is that Fury Road leaned more on CGI than has often been recognized.\n\nWhat if the Wives played an active role in helping young Furiosa hide from Rictus and sending him on his way?"
