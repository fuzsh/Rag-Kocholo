        "text": "George Miller has\n\nunfinished business\n\nwith Max Rockatansky.\n\nIt is early March, and Miller is sitting on a Warner Bros. mixing stage in Burbank trying to rid his long-awaited fantasy epic “Mad Max: Fury Road” of “red-tailed hawks” — industry slang for sound effects that have been overused to the point of cliché, like the aforementioned bird of prey whose familiar cry routinely accompanies establishing shots of picturesque wildernesses. Miller asks if one such sound might be the squeal of feedback heard as the film’s principal villain, Immortan Joe, picks up a microphone to speak to his followers — a cult of starving peasants and sycophantic “war boys” living in a futuristic desert outpost called the Citadel. It’s an auditory beat most moviegoers wouldn’t consciously register, but which Miller weighs as seriously as any piece of action or performance.\n\nFor hours, Miller goes through the already-mixed film reel by reel and, at the end of each, without having jotted down so much as a word on paper, gives detailed notes on the changes he wants to make: the voice of a young girl in a hallucinatory flashback should be less sharp; the sound of a swinging metal chain should be “more subjective.” “There’s a phenomenal amount of wisdom and artistry in this room,” the 70-year-old Australian filmmaker says of his mixers. Less than 24 hours earlier, he stepped off a plane from Sydney, but shows no visible signs of fatigue.\n\nIt was on another transpacific flight 15 years ago that Miller first dreamed — literally — of making “Fury Road.” As the 747 jumbo jet soared into the night sky, a movie began to play out vividly in the director’s mind. He saw a vast ocher desert and a caravan of vehicles moving across it — one of them a large tanker truck being driven by a futuristic warrior goddess. Also along for the ride was an old friend Miller hadn’t seen or thought about in decades: Rockatansky, the post-apocalyptic soldier-of-fortune played by Mel Gibson in Miller’s 1979 debut feature, “Mad Max,” and in two sequels that had set a daunting high bar for the modern action movie. By the time Miller landed back home in Australia, “Fury Road” had willed itself into being.\n\nWhat Miller couldn’t imagine at the time was that the road to making and releasing “Fury Road” would prove nearly as long and perilous as the one traveled by the movie’s desperate characters, paved with multiple false starts, cast and crew changes, wars, natural disasters, a ballooning budget, and an increasingly nervous studio.\n\nAt the center of it all was a visionary, detail-obsessed director determined to bring his genre-defining world into the 21st century while still doing things very much the old-fashioned way. The movie’s elaborate stunts (more than 300 of them) would all be performed live on set, just as Miller had always done them. CGI would be employed only to remove unwanted elements from the frame rather than painting things in. “We don’t defy the laws of physics — there are no flying human beings, no spacecraft — so it doesn’t make sense to do it as CG,” Miller says. “We’ve got real vehicles and real humans in a real desert, and you hope that all that texture will be up there on the screen.”\n\nNow Warner Bros. is banking on “Fury Road” (which opens worldwide May 15) to be a giant summer hit both with older audiences and younger moviegoers who weren’t born when the last “Mad Max” movie — 1985’s “Beyond Thunderdome” — was released, gambling hundreds of millions of dollars on the production, marketing and global release of the R-rated film, which officially cost north of $150 million, and some say as high as $250 million (not counting P&A). Miller’s first live-action outing since his 1998 box office dud “Babe: Pig in the City,” Fury Road” is also being released into a much-more crowded modern era, where it will compete with a slew of other tentpoles including “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” the earthquake thriller “San Andreas” (also from Warners), Brad Bird’s “Tomorrowland” with George Clooney, and “Spy” starring Melissa McCarthy.\n\n“There were 10 pole cats swaying, coming down the road at speed, all of them on cars, and Guy was on one of the poles filming them,” Miller recalls. “I choked up. I thought: ‘Wow, it’s real. It’s absolutely real.’ ”\n\nThe making of “Fury Road” wasn’t supposed to be such a saga, but then, where Miller is concerned, projects tend to mushroom in their ambitions and logistical challenges as fast as his mental synapses can carry them. “It’s so easy to write something on the page or do a drawing of it,” the perpetually cheerful filmmaker says on a recent morning, speaking by phone from his Sydney office, where he has just signed off on the 3D conversion of “Fury Road” the night before. He notes that when he first conceived of his 2006 animated hit, “Happy Feet,” “it was going to be a small thing, and it ended up with a lot of penguins” — and so many computers that IBM had to build him a server farm to accommodate the data needed to render the film’s motion-capture animation. The production process, always comparatively long in animation, stretched on for four years.\n\n“He doesn’t set himself easy tasks,” says Margaret Sixel, Miller’s editor and wife of 12 years. “I always laugh and say, ‘George, why do you make it so difficult for yourself? You could shoot a nice little biopic that someone else wrote.’ ”\n\nTalk to Miller’s closest collaborators and words like “forensic,” “granular” and, yes, “exhausting,” frequently enter the conversation. In the “Fury Road” editing room, he insisted on looking at every take of every shot, and every possible combination of those shots, before signing off on a scene. On the scoring stage, composer Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) and his musicians nicknamed the movie “There Will Be Notes.” Yet, the director is anything but a tyrant, which may be one reason why he inspires such fierce loyalty in his cast and crew. “He’s such a good general that he can push people and they will go with it and embrace it and then they miss it,” says Sixel. “For those who don’t like it, they leave early.”\n\nStill, if “Fury Road” was never going to be a walk in the park, it was meant to arrive much sooner. Shortly after the idea first came to him, Miller approached British comicbook artist Brendan McCarthy to collaborate with him on a screenplay — one quite unlike anything Miller, or anyone else in movies, had ever done. A passionate believer in cinema as a visual medium, Miller wanted to forgo a conventional script, and instead draw “Fury Road” as a series of detailed storyboards, a screenplay in images. McCarthy, who revered the director’s films, was game for the challenge (he had, in the ’80s, co-authored a comic series, “Freakwave,” described as “Mad Max Goes Surfing”). Their collaboration would eventually produce some 3,500 panels, which took up every inch of available wall space in one large conference room of Miller’s office. A bound copy of the drawings, known as the Comic Book, was the closest thing “Fury Road” would ever have to a conventional shooting script.\n\nThat was enough, however, to secure a commitment from Gibson, then still very much at the height of his box office powers, and well before his notorious 2006 Malibu arrest. In December 2002, it was announced that Miller and Gibson would make “Fury Road” as a co-production between their respective banners, with a $104 million budget, a $25 million payday for the star, and 20th Century Fox footing the bill. Shooting was scheduled to begin the following spring in Namibia, where Miller had scouted a desert location worthy of his grand designs — not a patch of green anywhere in sight, and certainly no green screens. A summer 2004 release was planned. But Miller’s vision of a future world ravaged by gas wars and depleted natural resources soon became a bit too prescient: By the spring of 2003, a U.S.-led invasion of Iraq seemed imminent, and Fox, citing general concerns about international travel and shipping restrictions, delayed the film’s start until fall. “What we do have firmly in place is Mel and George,” Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos told Variety at the time.\n\nBut fall came and went, and Miller, who was being pressured by Warners to fish or cut bait on “Happy Feet,” threw himself into that project instead; it went on to earn $384 million worldwide, win the animated film Oscar, and spawn a Miller-directed sequel, “Happy Feet Two” (2011), that also ran years behind schedule. In the interim, news of “Fury Road” went cold, save for Miller’s occasionally stated intention to still make the film, and a flurry of unsubstantiated rumors: that he would shoot two “Max” films back to back; that he had scrapped plans to make a live-action “Max” altogether, and was instead developing the project as a Japanese-style anime.\n\nIn 2009, shortly after plans collapsed for Miller to direct a $220 million “Justice League” movie, a new incarnation of “Fury Road” came together at Warners, which had released two of the previous “Max” films and enjoyed a longtime co-financing deal with Australian production and exhibition giant Village Roadshow. Gibson was now out of the picture, having grown some combination of too old, too cold (at the box office) and too controversial. Instead, Miller chose Tom Hardy to step into the title character’s iconic leather boots, after seeing the relatively unknown British actor in Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Bronson” and in a 2007 television film, “Stuart: A Life Backwards,” where he played a mentally disabled homeless man opposite Benedict Cumberbatch. Charlize Theron would join Hardy as the one-armed mercenary named Furiosa, Max’s distaff doppelganger. Production was now set to start in early 2011 in Broken Hill, the remote Australian mining town where both 1981’s “Mad Max 2” (released in the U.S. as “The Road Warrior”) and “Beyond Thunderdome” had been filmed. Construction commenced on sets and the dozens of custom-designed vehicles that would careen, cartwheel and otherwise collide in the latest iteration of Miller’s dystopian demolition derby.\n\nAnd then the rains came — unprecedented flooding caused by tropical cyclone Yasi and a La Nina weather pattern that battered eastern Australia throughout the austral summer. Over a four-day stretch in January 2011 alone, Broken Hill received more than half its usual annual rainfall, turning the usually arid land into a verdant golf course. The movie gods seemed to be laughing at Miller’s well-laid plans. But where most directors might have high-tailed it into a studio and created a virtual desert, Miller asked then-Warner studio head Jeff Robinov for another postponement, and to relocate the production back to Namibia — a decision that would mean shipping all the sets and cars halfway around the world via the Indian Ocean. Robinov, who was no stranger to betting on the visions of maverick auteurs (including Christopher Nolan and Alfonso Cuaron, the latter of whom was making “Gravity” for the studio at the time), gave his blessing.\n\nRefining the Story\n\nIn some respects, Miller says, the delays were fortuitous. With each new setback came a chance to re-examine and refine the “Fury Road” script. That included enlisting a friend of more than 40 years, Greek-Australian actor and drama coach (but novice screenwriter) Nick “Nico” Lathouris, to add thematic weight to the story Miller and McCarthy had already mapped out visually. As a drama student in 1971, Lathouris had been cast by Miller in the first film he ever directed: a comic short made for a revue at Sydney’s St. Vincent Hospital, where Miller was completing his medical residency. In a sign of the Miller oeuvre to come, Lathouris was filmed by the director peddling a brakeless bicycle down a steep hill while being chased by a gang of medical residents, who were costumed in nuns’ habits and riding motorbikes. Eight years later, as a budding film star, Lathouris played the role of Grease Rat in the original “Mad Max,” fondly remembered for uttering the line, “Speed’s just a question of money. How fast you wanna go?”\n\n“He’s one of those people who digs very deeply into material, and that’s exactly what ‘Fury Road’ needed,” says Miller. “Otherwise, it would have been just a surface action movie. To the extent that you detect any subtext, that’s stuff I really worked out with Nico.” That subtext included a strong feminist slant, including a topical discussion of women’s reproductive rights (in the film’s inciting incident, Theron’s character breaks a group of pregnant “breeders” out from under Immortan Joe’s ever watchful eye). “So much of extreme world poverty is really, truly because of the lack of empowerment of women, and if that were to change one day, a lot of those problems would be solved,” observes Theron. “I think George is really aware of that stuff in the world, and I think he’s truly interested in women.”\n\nAlthough the “Max” films were never long on expository chit-chat — in “The Road Warrior,” Gibson had less than a dozen lines of dialogue — with “Fury Road,” Miller envisioned taking an even bolder leap into the realm of pure action cinema. Whereas most big-budget franchise movies labor exhaustively to establish the mythologies and ground rules of their fantasy realms, “Fury Road” would effectively unfold as one continuous chase sequence, dropping viewers right into the thick of things, and only gradually explaining itself as it went along. Some details — like the backstories of the Max and Furiosa characters, and the exact nature of how the world ended — would remain intentionally vague, to be expanded upon in future “Max” adventures. The goal, Miller says, was to give the viewer the sensation of being anthropologists confronted with some strange nomadic culture. “You wouldn’t understand initially what was going on, but you would never doubt the authenticity of, say, a native people’s behavior,” he says. “That’s what we were striving for.”\n\nThe additional down time also allowed action unit director Guy Norris to further refine the movie’s car stunts, which would require dozens of custom-built vehicles to appear in the frame at any given moment. Norris, too, came to “Fury Road” with deep “Mad Max” roots; 30 years earlier, as a young actor and stuntman, he’d played a henchman of the villainous Lord Humungus in “The Road Warrior,” and had collaborated with Miller many times since. For one of “Fury Road’s” most complicated sequences, Miller envisioned human “pole cats” perched high on lookout posts attached to cars speeding across the desert — an effect the director initially thought would have to be achieved at least partially through CGI. Then, during one pre-production lull, Norris sent Miller a videotaped surprise. “There were 10 pole cats swaying, coming down the road at speed, all of them on cars, and Guy was on one of the poles filming them,” Miller recalls. “I choked up. I thought: ‘Wow, it’s real. It’s absolutely real.’ ”\n\nWhen you meet Miller for the first (or even the 10th) time, it can be tough to reconcile the soft-spoken man in curly, graying hair and spectacles with the strange visions that emanate from his mind. That is as true of the “Max” films as it is of “Happy Feet,” an ostensible children’s entertainment in which the young penguin hero eventually finds himself imprisoned in a zoo, suffering the psychological effects of institutionalization; and “Babe: Pig in the City” (1998), Miller’s phantasmagorical sequel to the beloved 1995 Oscar-winner, which begins with the porcine protagonist nearly causing the demise of the kindly Farmer Hoggett, and gets progressively weirder and more nightmarish. Even Miller’s one straight adult drama, “Lorenzo’s Oil” (1992), depicts the decline of a young boy suffering from a rare neurological disease in the kind of disquieting detail usually reserved for full-fledged horror movies (one possible reason why, despite its considerable acclaim, the movie failed to connect with a large audience).\n\nMiller gets asked about this contradiction between the man and his art a lot, and he has no answer for it, except that as a junior medical resident in a neurosurgical operating theater, he saw more than one exposed human brain sitting inches from his face, and it made him wonder. “Having had that unique intimacy causes you to ask a lot of questions about who we are as humankind,” he says. He saw a lot of carnage too, working in an emergency room — visions that would eventually inform “Mad Max’s” macabre fusions of metal and flesh.\n\nBut Miller’s singular imagination is also the byproduct of a childhood spent roaming the Australian outback town of Chinchilla, Queensland (the self-proclaimed “Melon Capital of Australia”), where he was raised by Greek immigrant parents who had anglicized the family name from Miliotis. “It was mostly just bush bordering on desert — that in-between sort of world,” recalls Miller, who would spend Saturday mornings indulging in one of Chinchilla’s few cultural pastimes: the local picture show. Young George was particularly fond of Westerns, and spent much of his free time reenacting on horseback, under the desert sun, the stories he’d seen onscreen with his friends. “I realized a long time later that it was an invisible apprenticeship for filmmaking,” he says. “When I make a film, it feels very familiar to that play we had inspired by the cinema.”\n\nWith his twin brother, John, Miller went on to medical school at the U. of New South Wales, but never lost his appetite for movies. While still in his St. Vincent’s residency, he enrolled in a monthlong filmmaking workshop at Melbourne U., where he met the 21-year-old Byron Kennedy, a technical whiz who’d been making 8mm films since high school. “We both recognized in the other, to some degree, an outsider who didn’t think too much inside the box,” Miller says. Together with a small crew, they went on to make “Violence in the Cinema, Part 1,” a wry, 20-minute parody of educational films, in which an academic lecturing on the titular subject drones on and on, even as he’s attacked by a shotgun-wielding maniac. Miller wrote and directed, while Kennedy produced, shot and edited. When the short premiered at the 1971 Sydney Film Festival, it created a mild scandal, and announced the duo as prodigious young filmmakers to be reckoned with."
