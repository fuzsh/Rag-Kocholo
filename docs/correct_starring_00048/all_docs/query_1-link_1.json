        "text": "Mel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson (born January 3, 1956) portrayed Max Rockatansky in George Miller's three original films: Mad Max, Mad Max 2 and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGibson's recollection of his audition for \"Max\" -- one he used to tell quite often -- was that he secured the role after he accompanied Steve Bisley (who went on to play Jim Goose) to the auditions. Although Gibson wanted to read for the audition, the tale told often states that Gibson was too bruised and bloodied from a previous night's brawl to recite the lines. Therefore, the casting director asked him to return in a fortnight for they were interested in roguish faces for the casting of the film's villains. However, when Gibson returned, his face had cleared up of bruising, which in turn showed-off his good looks to the casting directors. This in turn, according to Gibson, won him the role.\n\nMany of the members involved in the casting have, however, dismissed Gibson's recollection as nothing but a tall-tale, insisting that his confidence and charisma were qualities that won him the role on the first day of auditions.\n\nMel Gibson's role as \"Max\" is often cited as his breakthrough acting role, and was the film that started his career within the film industry, the indie blockbuster making Gibson an internationally recognised face and icon.\n\nSelected Filmography[]\n\nActing[]\n\nTim (1979)\n\nMad Max (1979)\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981)\n\nGallipoli (1981)\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously (1982)\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nAir America (1990)\n\nLethal Weapon series (1987, 1989, 1992, 1998)\n\nMaverick (1994)\n\nBraveheart (1995)\n\nRansom (1996)\n\nConspiracy Theory (1997)\n\nWhat Women Want (2000)\n\nThe Patriot (2000)\n\nSigns (2002)\n\nWe Were Soldiers (2002)\n\nGet the Gringo (2012)\n\nThe Expendables 3 (2014)\n\nDaddy's Home 2 (2017)\n\nDragged Across Concrete (2018)\n\nThe Continental (2023) John Wick TV Series\n\nDirecting[]\n\nThe Man Without a Face (1993)\n\nBraveheart (1995) Won the Academy Award for \"Best Picture\" & \"Best Director\"\n\nThe Passion of the Christ (2004)\n\nApocalypto (2006)\n\nHacksaw Ridge (2016)\n\n[]\n\nMel Gibson at Lethal Weapon Wiki\n\nMel Gibson's Wikipedia page\n\nMel Gibson on the Internet movie Database (IMDb)\n\nSee Also[]\n\nCast and Crew of Mad Max (1979)"
