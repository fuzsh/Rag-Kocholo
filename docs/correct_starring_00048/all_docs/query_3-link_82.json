        "text": "To help him get into the mind of Demetus, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga star Chris Hemsworth did some in-character journaling.\n\nWhen it comes to getting in the head of a larger-than-life character, there are a couple of different approaches that an actor can take. We have seen many people decide that sinking entirely into the role and method acting is the way to go. For some, it's as simple as what is on the page. It's different for every actor and every role. The world of Mad Max is a world where everything is turned up to eleven, and that's when you're playing the good guys. When you're the villain in a Mad Max film, you're a villain in a world of extremes, and in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, we're going to see a role like that done by Chris Hemsworth. He was having trouble getting into the head of his villainous character Demetus when director Geroge Miller suggested something that most of our therapists have suggested to us at one time or another: journaling.\n\n\"George suggested to me to journal as the character, which I hadn't done before,\" Hemsworth explained in an interview with Total Film. \"It was 2 am one night. I was awake, and I just put pen to paper, and just started scribbling down thoughts and ideas as Dementus. I didn't think much of it. I went to sleep and woke up, and was quite shocked at what came out of me in that half-asleep state. I went into rehearsal, and showed George, and we both went, 'That's it. That's the direction we've got to go.\"\n\nWho would have thought we would have Furiosa as yet another real-life example that maybe the therapist knows what they are talking about? Help can come from the strangest places, and sometimes breaking through the wall to get into a character's mind is as simple as some late-night bullet journaling.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga: Summary, Cast List, Release Date\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller's Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal \"Mad Max\" films. Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash Mad Max: Fury Road. The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (Mad Max: Fury Road, Babe), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner.\n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe. While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home. Taylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024, and internationally beginning on 22 May, 2024."
