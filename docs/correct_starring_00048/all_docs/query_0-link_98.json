        "text": "Film Talks\n\nIn 1971, Australia introduced its own domestic version of the R rating, leading to a two decades long boom in independent genre film production that came to be known as Ozploitation. Enter George Miller, a young medical doctor who wanted to make a splash with his debut film starring a young American immigrant, Mel Gibson.\n\nMad Max earned a cult following upon its 1980 U.S. release, while its follow-up, 1981’s The Road Warrior, became a sleeper hit. Two more films in the series followed, 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and Miller’s long-anticipated return to the character after a 30-year hiatus, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)."
