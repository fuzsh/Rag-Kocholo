        "text": "[light music] Hello, I'm George Miller\n\nand I'm the director of Furiosa,\n\nwhich is a Mad Max saga.\n\nAnd I'm going to be talking about all the inspirations\n\nor many of the inspirations that led to this film\n\nand how I work.\n\nFor me, movies are visual music.\n\nThey should almost be read purely with the syntax of cinema.\n\nSo I'm really excited to be doing this.\n\n[light music continues] [shutter clicking]\n\nWell, Mad Max, boy, it's a long story.\n\nWay back in the mid 70s, I became interested in film,\n\nnot with any regard to any sort of career\n\nor anything like that.\n\nI was a kid who grew up with my twin brother in\n\nrural Australia, before there was television,\n\nbefore there was internet.\n\nThere was just play, school and the Saturday matinee.\n\nAnd that had massive influence on me of course.\n\nAnd the first Mad Max, which was the first feature\n\nthat we worked on, I really wanted it to be a film in which,\n\nas Hitchcock said, they don't have\n\nto read the subtitles in Japan.\n\nThat they're read purely as a bit of visual music.\n\nI didn't really know what I was doing then.\n\nNone of us were experienced.\n\nEven Mel Gibson, who's played Mad Max, he was straight out\n\nof drama school, never really worked on a movie before.\n\nBut somehow,\n\nsomehow it tapped into universal archetypes.\n\nFor instance, in Japan, he was seen as a samurai,\n\nin Scandinavia, some sort of lone viking.\n\nAnd in particular, the French said, 'Oh,\n\nthese are westerns on wheels.\n\nAnd in the way that the American Western,\n\nthey were allegorical, a very elemental world\n\nwith very simple rules, allowed you to get a lot\n\nof story into it.\n\nSo from the beginning, those sort of stories,\n\nfigures in the landscape undergoing some sort\n\nof fundamental conflict, which is the essence of all drama,\n\nwas the kind of staple of film storytelling.\n\nMad Max and Furiosa\n\nand these Mad Max stories are kind of a progression along\n\nthat same continuum.\n\n[drum music]\n\nOh, so here we are, Queensland, Australia.\n\nThis is very familiar.\n\nThis is kind of flat loamy earth.\n\nAs I said, there's nothing but the Saturday matinee.\n\nSo in Mad Max 2, it was really interesting.\n\nThere's the OPEC oil crisis in the early '70s.\n\nIn Melbourne where we were, a very lovely city.\n\nNone of the social pressures that lead\n\nto violence and so on.\n\nBut it took 10 days of oil restrictions\n\nfor the first shot to be fired.\n\nIt wasn't fired at anybody.\n\nWe don't have a gun culture in Australia,\n\nbut it was fired in the air\n\nwhere someone got ahead in a queue,\n\na long queue that went for blocks.\n\nAnd I thought if it took 10 days,\n\nwhat would happen in a hundred days?\n\nWhat would happen in a thousand days?\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAnd that led to these sort of stories.\n\nBut that's been the story throughout history.\n\nI have resources, you don't.\n\nI have to protect them.\n\nThat's who we are,\n\nthe worst and the best of us, in these sort of things.\n\nStory always has primacy.\n\nStory is all, everything is driven by story.\n\nBut then to play with the technology\n\nand kind of do things that you couldn't imagine doing\n\nbefore is very exciting.\n\nAnd the biggest shift in cinema\n\nafter sound was the digital dispensation.\n\nBut I think Jurassic Park was probably the first big\n\nevent in digital cinema.\n\n63 shots of dinosaurs really kind of started it.\n\nWe were lucky enough with the first Babe film\n\nto be at Universal who already knew\n\nwhat this technology was doing.\n\nAnd we were able to sort of make little animals talk.\n\nThat was really a exciting time.\n\nThe cinematographer of the Babe movies, Andrew Leslnie,\n\nwent on to shoot Lord of the Rings\n\nand he came back from the very first one\n\nand showed me the first motion capture of Gollum.\n\nI'd never even heard of motion capture.\n\nAnd I thought, Holy cow, we have the story of the penguins.\n\nWe can make these penguins dance.\n\nThat led to Happy Feet.\n\nThat was driven by the technology.\n\nThe story was the most important thing,\n\nbut the means to actually tell the story optimally,\n\nwas becoming available.\n\nAlmost at the same time, I was thinking, wow, these tools,\n\nhaving done animation,\n\nwe can apply to action films or stories like Mad Max.\n\nWe can do things that we can never dream\n\nof doing in the past.\n\nHere, what's really interesting about these pictures here is\n\nthe image of Buster Keaton, 1926 silent movie on this train.\n\nIncredible, incredible movie.\n\nNot only that he's directing him,\n\nbut doing these real-life stunts, incredibly unsafe.\n\nAnd then an image from Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome in '85.\n\nAnd it's the same image on a track with the front\n\nof that vehicle.\n\nCinema like all arts\n\nor all human endeavors, there's a kind\n\nof cultural evolution.\n\nOne thing builds on another.\n\nAnd when I see things like this, I realize, okay,\n\nthese are the influences that basically\n\nwe're all part of a continuum on.\n\nAgain, you've got another image here from The General\n\nand then also from Furiosa,\n\nwhich we've done almost a hundred years later.\n\nWe've got an image like that.\n\nAnd here you have pictures of Once a time in the West,\n\nSafety Last with Harold Lloyd\n\nand then Lawrence of Arabia with trains and so on.\n\nAnd then we start doing the similar things in this time.\n\nAgain, I guess vehicles, moving vehicles,\n\nonce they were horses and trains.\n\nNow they've combustion-driven engines.\n\nI mean interesting, the world of Mad Max, 45 years\n\nafter the fall of man, when all the institutions have gone,\n\nthe power grids and everything's gone.\n\nAnd we go to the isolated center\n\nof a continent like Australia.\n\nThere are no electric cars.\n\nIt's impossible.\n\nThey can only get so far.\n\nYou can't charge them anymore.\n\nThere's nothing you can use\n\nand repurpose in those sort of engines.\n\nSo you end up going back to earlier technologies,\n\nand that's why we have the kind of cars that we have.\n\nAnd now I'm gonna talk about the production design,\n\nwhich is really key.\n\nOn the very first Mad Max,\n\nthere are only 30 people in the credits.\n\nOn this film, this is shooting, there are a thousand people.\n\nHow do you bring everyone together with the same sort\n\nof ideas and visions?\n\nWhat are the guiding ideas?\n\nSo one of the most important things was to say\n\nthat everything that we see in the film,\n\nevery single detail, every utterance, every bit\n\nof behavior had to be made of found objects repurposed.\n\nThat was really, really key.\n\nAnd we had to understand\n\nwhere those found objects came from.\n\nIf you look at any of the vehicles, particularly\n\nin Fury Road and Furiosa they had\n\nto be from existing vehicles, again, cobbled together,\n\nrepaired, put together in some way.\n\nJust because we're in an impoverished world,\n\nit doesn't mean people stop making beautiful things.\n\nSo if you've got stuff\n\nand you put together this kind of, you know,\n\nfound object art, people take great pride.\n\nIt's in our instinct to do it really well.\n\nEven the earliest times, you know, cave paintings,\n\nthat's something that we all do culturally.\n\nYou make the most of what you've got.\n\nAnd we see that over and over again.\n\nThis was in the '70s.\n\nWe saw some footage of the '30s\n\nwhere police were putting on these police pageants\n\nwith bikes, doing all these sort of formations and so on.\n\nAnd there was a chariot race\n\nwhere people had two bikes and a chariot.\n\nAnd it was based on the first Ben Hur movie,\n\nthe silent version.\n\nIn the late '50s,\n\nthere was that big one with Charlton Heston,\n\nthat amazing chariot race in big wide screen.\n\nAnd when we saw that footage, we said, Well, of course.\n\nDementus, the Chris Hemsworth character, sees himself\n\nas some sort of glorified, I don't know,\n\nRoman classical figure.\n\nAnd so he rides across the wasteland\n\nwith his massive hoard of bikers in a chariot bike.\n\nHere, we see it here.\n\nSo we have the police in the '70s,\n\nWe saw it from the '30s in Australia, Ben Hur in 1959,\n\nand here he is doing the similar thing here.\n\nOne of the things I noticed\n\nafter I thought we'd let go of all the Mad Max world,\n\nyou know, back in the '80s, there were a lot\n\nof dystopian stories and films and particularly games.\n\nAnd the basic instinct was to desaturate everything\n\nto make it very, almost more monochrome.\n\nAnd I thought, if we keep doing what's been done,\n\nit'll feel too familiar.\n\nIt's almost become a trope to make things look desaturated.\n\nSo that was a big influence on the look\n\nof Fury Road and now Furiosa.\n\nThe other thing we picked up was, as I said,\n\nwhen the French said\n\nthat these films are Westerns on wheels,\n\nif you looked at the all the classic westerns,\n\nthey always shot day for night.\n\nThe main reason they shot day for night is\n\nbecause horses don't have headlights.\n\nSo it's only when you have headlights that you need\n\nto shoot night for night in order to see the...\n\nNow in the wasteland, it's definitely not conducive\n\nto your survival if you keep your headlights on\n\n'cause people can see you from miles away.\n\nSo you don't want to draw attention to yourself.\n\nSo if you're traveling at night\n\nas they were in Fury Road, escaping in the War Rig\n\nacross the wasteland, the last thing you want to do is\n\nput your headlights on.\n\nSo we shot day for night.\n\nWhen I went to Japan, they said, Oh, Max is a samurai.\n\nYou must have seen a lot of Kurosawa movies.\n\nAnd to my shame, I said, Who's Kurosawa?\n\nWhich is terrible.\n\nWhen they told me, I made it my job to immediately go\n\nand see all the Kurosawa movies.\n\nOf course, what was so amazing about him,\n\nhe took basically Hollywood cinema and reinterpreted it.\n\nI'm following in that, sort of going down that path\n\nbecause again, he was someone who's able to take cinema\n\nand make it his own and master all this stuff.\n\nAnd it's so great\n\nthat you've got these images here like this.\n\nIt's fantastic.\n\n[drum music]\n\nSo characters.\n\nHow do we approach characters?\n\nCharacters absolutely drive the narrative.\n\nIf you go back to the earliest times, let's go back\n\nto the Greeks and so on, it's all about what characters want\n\nand how those wants bring them into conflict with others.\n\nSo we were lucky enough in Fury Road to have Charlize\n\nwho's someone who has that kind of stature,\n\njust intrinsically as a person.\n\nYou know, it's purely an intuitive thing.\n\nWhen you actually cast someone,\n\nyou can't really articulate exactly why someone feels right.\n\nSo she was this character in the story.\n\nAlmost a decade goes by\n\nand we have to shoot Furiosa.\n\nAnd I was really looking\n\nto see whether we could use de-aging\n\nand all these sort of techniques.\n\nAnd I realized that wasn't working very well.\n\nSome great filmmakers tried it,\n\nand all you're looking at is the technology\n\nand you're not suspending disbelief\n\nand watching the story\n\nand believing in the character.\n\nSo we had to cast somebody who could fill Charlize's shoes.\n\nAnd when I saw Anya and her work, I realized,\n\nOh, there's something going on here.\n\nThere's something intense, kind of almost regal about her.\n\nTimeless.\n\nAnd I knew that she was someone\n\nwho was very rigorous in her work, like Charlize.\n\nI mean, both of those actors started ballet\n\nwhen they're very young.\n\nI find dancers.\n\nHaving worked with dancers on Happy Feet.\n\nI realized they have a great precision.\n\nI mean, it's amazing what they can do.\n\nThe timing is just amazing.\n\nAnd if you like are able to internalize all of that,\n\nthen you have a really fine actor.\n\nThe thing that defines the hero is that they come\n\nto a moment where they have\n\nto relinquish their own self-interest to a greater good.\n\nThat's the fundamental gesture or behavior of the hero.\n\nNow Max does that, but in a reluctant way.\n\nHe doesn't want to be involved with other human beings.\n\nWhenever he gets involved with other human beings,\n\nsomehow it's always too painful.\n\nSo he's a kind of a good man running away from himself.\n\nThat happened in Mel Gibson's version\n\nand it also happens in the Tom Hardy version.\n\nAnd that's interesting, quite different from the\n\nFuriosa character who basically is driven\n\nby some sort of obligation, a promise to her mother\n\nto find her way home.\n\nDespite all her Herculean efforts,\n\ncan't do it and becomes something else.\n\nAnd then decides redemption's not for her,\n\nbut it's for others as she says, less corrupted.\n\nAnd that's the wives.\n\nThey're very interesting characters to me,\n\n'cause they're very, very sort of classic characters\n\nthat are timeless in a way.\n\nAnd I mean these stories are allegories\n\nand that's one of the big attraction for me\n\nto work on those films.\n\n[light instrumental music]\n\nI mean, I'm surprised by some\n\nof the stuff I've seen in here.\n\nYou know, it makes me want to keep sort of doing it,\n\nstimulated by the very conversation we've had here.\n\nI'm still doing it.\n\nAnd people say, Why are you still doing it?\n\nAnd I say, Well, I'm still really curious about it.\n\nIt's changing.\n\nI'm surprised how everything is changing\n\nand how you're engaged in something that is ongoing.\n\nI mean, you could be making films for a thousand years\n\nand never master it.\n\nThere's too much to understand.\n\nSo anyway, thanks so much for this.\n\nThis is a great experience.\n\nThank you."
