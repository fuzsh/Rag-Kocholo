        "text": "With legacy sequels being all the rage in Hollywood, it’s within reason to imagine that perhaps a world exists where George Miller asks Mel Gibson to return for a new ‘Mad Max’ film in the future. If “Ghostbusters” can do it, so can ‘Mad Max.’ Well, there’s one problem, though–George Miller hasn’t thought about what an elderly Max would be like.\n\nREAD MORE: George Miller Says He Spoke To Jodie Comer For ‘Furiosa’ Briefly, Talks Max’s Cameo & The Upcoming Chrome Version\n\nSpeaking to Jake’s Takes, in an interview from a couple weeks ago (prior to the release of ‘Furiosa’), George Miller was asked about the possibility of Mel Gibson returning as Max in a future ‘Mad Max’ movie. While he didn’t say it would never happen, it’s quite clear that Miller has no interest in what a retired Max would do.\n\n“There’s no story that I have [in mind] that has an older character,” explained Miller. “At a certain point, it’s not like an ‘Unforgiven’ or one of those movies where it’s an old, burnt out person coming back one more time. There probably are stories to tell. I don’t know what happens to Max when he gets to his 60s. I haven’t even thought about it.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Wasteland’: George Miller’s Next ‘Mad Max’ Film Is A “Saga” Similar To ‘Furiosa’\n\nNow, considering the release of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” it’s quite silly to even imagine a studio would rush out to fund a big legacy sequel in the franchise. ‘Furiosa’ has done dismal box office money in the two-plus weeks it’s been in theaters. At this point, it would be somewhat silly to imagine Miller will have the money to make the sequel he’s basically already written, “Mad Max: The Wasteland.” So, for anything to include Mel Gibson, plans would have to change mightily.\n\n“Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” is in theaters now.
