Fans have been trying to guess who's behind Immortan Joe's mask in the first Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga trailer even since it dropped, but the answer isn't easy to find. Here's what we think.

The entire Furiosa cast and roster of characters are a bit of a mystery besides the two leads, Anya Taylor-Joy (Furiosa) and Chris Hemsworth (Dementus), and returning actors from 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road like Nathan Jones (Rictus Erectus) and Angus Sampson (The Organic Mechanic). But at the center of all fan speculation around George Miller's long-anticipated prequel is Immortan Joe, the main villain of the 2015 movie. In this entry, based on the teaser trailer and what we've learned from interviews, Joe isn't the big boss yet, so we're potentially looking at an arc for the villain, who seems to be at odds with Hemsworth's Dementus. But neither the footage we've seen of him nor the chatter surrounding the movie have answered who's behind the iconic mask.

Who played Immortan Joe in Mad Max: Fury Road?

Immortan Joe was played in Mad Max: Fury Road by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who sadly passed away in December 1, 2020. Known as the first-ever Mad Max villain, Toecutter, in the 1979 movie, he returned to the franchise to work with George Miller and play an entirely different bad guy.

As much as everyone loved his menacing presence in Fury Road, we doubt he'd have returned to play a younger Joe in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, as the story takes place 15 years before the Max and Furiosa-led movie and Joe doesn't look as deteriorated in the prequel. While this hasn't been really confirmed by Miller, it feels like the plan was always to have someone younger step into the role.
