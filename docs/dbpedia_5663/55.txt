A political federation between the Hashemite Kingdoms of Jordan and Iraq, founded on 14 February 1958 in response to the formation of the aggressively pan-Arab United Arab Republic. The relatively loose union was effectively dissolved by the Iraqi coup of 14 July 1958, in which its leader, Faisal II, was murdered.
