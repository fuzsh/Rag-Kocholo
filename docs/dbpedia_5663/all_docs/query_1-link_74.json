        "text": "The hanging of Saddam Hussein ended the life of one of the most brutal tyrants in recent history and negated the fiction that he himself maintained even as the gallows loomed -- that he remained president of Iraq despite being toppled by the United States military and that his power and his palaces would be restored to him in time.\n\nThe despot, known as Saddam, had oppressed Iraq for more than 30 years, unleashing devastating regional wars and reducing his once promising, oil-rich nation to a claustrophobic police state.\n\nFor decades, it had seemed that his unflinching hold on Iraq would endure, particularly after he lasted through disastrous military adventures against first Iran and then Kuwait, where an American-led coalition routed his unexpectedly timid military in 1991.\n\nHis own conviction that he was destined by God to rule Iraq forever was such that he refused to accept that he would be overthrown in April 2003, even as American tanks penetrated the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in a war that has become a bitterly contentious, bloody occupation.\n\nAfter eluding capture for eight months, Mr. Hussein became the American military's High Value Detainee No. 1. But he heaped scorn on the Iraqi judge who referred to him as the \"former\" president after asking him to identify himself on the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, which ultimately lead to his execution.\n\n\"I didn't say 'former president,' I said 'president,' and I have rights according to the Constitution, among them immunity from prosecution,\" he growled from the docket. The outburst underscored the boundless egotism and self-delusion of a man who fostered such a fierce personality cult during the decades that he ran the Middle Eastern nation that joking about him or criticizing him in public could bring a death sentence.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
