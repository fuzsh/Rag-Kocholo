        "text": "The Republic of Iraq lies in an area called Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Iraq covers over 438,000 square kilometres of territory north of Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf, and Kuwait, west of Iran, south of Turkey, and east of Syria and Jordan. Its population of over 30 million people is predominantly Muslim and Arab, though it is split between the Sunni and Shi’a sects, with the Shi’a dominating. However, there is a significant minority of Sunni Muslim Kurds in the north. The majority of the people live in urban environments, with over 5.7 million people living in the capital of Baghdad.\n\nConstitutional history\n\n2005 Constitution\n\nExecutive branch\n\nLegislative branch\n\nJudicial branch\n\nPolitical Challenges\n\nSystem of government under 2005 Constitution\n\nTimeline"
