        "meta_description": "Iraq, as a Middle Eastern nation-state, emerged following the First World War, similarly to Turkey, Iran and Syria. However, it has struggled to establish its foundations based on democratic principles and human rights, as well as a political system that promotes inclusive citizenship. Instead, these states have been characterized by ethnic identities from their inception, leading to discrimination among their citizens. Iraq, under King Faysal, was no exception as it was built on two principles, Arabism and Sunnism, resulting in significant discrimination based on religious and ethnic criteria.",
