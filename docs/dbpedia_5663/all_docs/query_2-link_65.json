        "text": "A closer look at key historic events that took place on August 2:\n\nIn 1998, the Second Congo War Begins\n\nThe Second Congo War, also known as the Great War of Africa, involved multiple African nations and resulted in the death of an estimated 5.4 million people, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II.\n\nIn 1990, Kuwait is invaded\n\nIraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait on August 2, leading to the Gulf War. The invasion was met with international condemnation and resulted in a military response by coalition forces led by the United States, which ultimately liberated Kuwait in 1991.\n\nIn 1958, the Arab Federation is dissolved\n\nThe Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan was officially dissolved on August 2. The federation was a short-lived political union formed in response to the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria, but it collapsed following a coup in Iraq that overthrew King Faisal II.\n\nIn 1945, the Potsdam Conference ends\n\nThe Potsdam Conference was where Allied leaders met to decide the post-World War II order and the administration of defeated Nazi Germany. The conference set the stage for the Cold War by highlighting ideological differences between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies.\n\nIn 1943, PT-109 is sunk\n\nThe U.S. Navy patrol torpedo boat PT-109, commanded by Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, was sunk by a Japanese destroyer in the Solomon Islands. Kennedy’s leadership and efforts to save his crew members after the sinking became a notable part of his World War II heroism and later political career.\n\nIn 1876, Wild Bill Hickok is murdered\n\nLegendary gunslinger, gambler and lawman Wild Bill Hickok was murdered while playing poker in Deadwood, South Dakota. Hickok was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall, and the hand of cards he was holding at the time of his death—aces and eights—became known as the “Dead Man’s Hand.”"
