Together that made him a novel choice to document life in wartime for the British Ministry of Information.\n\nThe young prince is shown seated on the throne that he will one day inherit, with his regent behind and finally as a simple young boy seated on the floor.\n\nEven the stiffness of the poses seem to tell the story of a young man aware of his future responsibilities.\n\nFollowing the end of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was broken up and Britain started administering the provinces of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul under a mandate from the League of Nations in 1921.\n\nFollowing a revolt by the Iraqi population who feared the mandate as a cover for British colonisation it then became a as a semi-independent state governed jointly by the British and King Faisal who had been instrumental in the Arab Revolt and later in the defeat of the Ottoman forces in the area by the British in 1917 and 1918.\n\nKing Faisal continued to rule when the British withdrew and the Kingdom of Iraq was established in 1932 before dying following a heart attack in 1933. (1)\n\nHis son King Ghazi was killed in a car crash in 1939 aged 26 and King Faisal II became king of Iraq at the age of four. (2)\n\nWith the King too young to rule, the Emir ‘Abd al-Ilah acted as regent. Often referred to as his uncle, the Emir was his second cousin and was briefly removed from power by a nationalist coup lead by future Iraqi prime minister Rashid Ali al-Gailani in 1941 before being restored by the British. (3) (4)\n\nThis coup attempt was backed by the Germans in a variety of ways including support from the ex German Ambassador Dr Fritz Grobba who having been left Iraq in September 1939 would return under a false identity. (5)\n\nOn 14 July 1958 members of Iraq’s military seized power and executed the King, the Regent and other members of the Royal family and government. (6) (7) (8)\n\nKing Faisal II was 23 years old and engaged to be married to Her Royal Highness Princess Sabiha Fazila Ibrahim Hanim Sultana of Egypt when he died.\n\nAs the echos from the gunshots faded the Republic of Iraq was born, its first president being Abd Al-Karim Qasim.\n\nLater the place of execution – a new palace commissioned by the young King Faisal – would become the Iraqi Republican Palace.\n\nInterestingly neither Qasim or Saddam Hussein – who had a number of palaces – chose to live there. Following the end of the invasion phase of the Iraq War the palace was occupied by American military before being handed back to the Iraqi government in 2009.
