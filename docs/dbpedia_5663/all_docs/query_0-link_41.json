        "text": "II. Fejsál, King of Iraq, reigned from 4 April 1939 to 14 July 1958. Born on May 2, 1935 in Baghdad, he was a member of the Hashemite dynasty as the only child of King Ghazi of Iraq and Princess Alija of Hejaz. His parents were first cousins, grandchildren of King Hussein of Hejaz. He came to the throne at the age of four, after the death of his father, King Gázi, in a car accident in 1939. The regency was taken over by his uncle, Abd al-Iláh, who also received the title of heir to the throne until the end of his life. Fejszál's mother, Queen Alija, died in 1950, and his maternal grandmother, Queen Nafísza, took over his upbringing. He was declared of age in 1953, when he was able to take the reigns in his hands, and then he swore to the constitution in front of the parliament. In the same year, it welcomed Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi and his second wife, Queen Soraja of Iran, who landed in Baghdad as the first stop of their one-week exile. 1958. was established on February 1 against the United Arab Republic, on February 14 the Arab Federation was established, the head of which was II. It became a headache. However, this union provoked the dislike of the army, which carried out a coup d'état on July 14, 1958. The coup plotters shot dead members of the royal family, including the king, the king's grandmother, his uncle, the heir to the throne, and his maternal aunt. The monarchy was abolished, and the change of power was followed by a series of coups and revolutions. II. Fejszál did not marry, but was engaged to an Egyptian princess. He is said to have had a son out of wedlock, who fathered further offspring. The tragedy of the royal family and the fate of the ruling house left a deep mark on the history of Iraq and the Middle East.\n\nII. During the reign of King Fejsál of Iraq, which lasted from 1939 to 1958, the coinage of Iraq underwent significant development. The king strove for modernization and economic development, and this was also reflected in the coinage. In 1939, at the beginning of Fejsál's reign, gold and silver coins were still minted in Iraq, but these were soon replaced by the previously unknown paper money. The first Iraqi paper money was issued in 1940 and was made in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 dinars. During the Second World War, Iraq was under German occupation, and this also affected the coinage. The German occupiers replaced the Iraqi money with their own money and removed the royal symbols from the coins. After the war, in 1945, Iraq returned to minting its own coins. Royal symbols were returned to coins and new coins were introduced, such as the 10 fils and 25 fils. In 1958, after the assassination of King Fejsál, a revolution broke out in Iraq and the royal system was overthrown. After the revolution, the new government also reorganized the Iraqi mint and introduced new coins and paper money. II. The coinage of Fejszál still has significant collector value today."
