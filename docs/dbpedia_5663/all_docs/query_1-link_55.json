In this morning's leading article, Al-Istiglal writes on the question of Syro-Iraqi Union-referring to the recent speech of the Party's opinion expressed by its President recently and clearly that the past months' events in Syria were proofs of what sincere Arabs of Syria and Iraq had in mind since the time of Faisal's regime which has now become a studied plan for execution. Had it not been for the hinder- ance placed in their way, the plan would have been carried out as expected by those sincere persons. Nevertheless, it has become essential as it is the only source of stability in Syria. It further expTins that the Party's opinion was always that the unity is not for the defense but it is the only means for the Arabs to unite against the Zionist danger after the failure of all the plans that were carried out and which were remained on paper only as referred to by the President the last of which was the Collective Security Plan. The benefit of this plan was doubtful on the experience gained from the Palestine battle. Although the Party welcomes any idea which strengthens the rela- tions between Arab countries, yet it finds that no cooperation would be stronger than the Syro-Iraqi Union. As for foreign influence, the President's method was final and clear when he said that the Party's binding to the Syro-Iraqi Union was based on the condition that Syria should be prercyrved from any foreign influence which would cause from the Iraq's relations with the Britain and other countries. To- day,while we find Syria is subject to more severe experiences, it proves to be the beginning of further interval which lacks stability it is incumbent on the Arab countries to think about what threatens Syria from the Zionist danger before thinking of their own differences an cons der the s to tion and unite them` TY FBrnR &t W/ ct1N c?Y`~0 Qf18 7000 fYe unit is the only means to rescue Syria from danger.

The situation of the University is in danger. He has mentioned to the Board that four of the students have been dismissed for various periods and that further attempts may occur.. He also mentions that the University is prepared to continue drastic action not only by putting an end to such events but also tg'ake positive steps to put an end to the political illiteracy/on which the Communist propaganda is based. It is worth mentioning that the A.U.B. has been established since 80 years and is considered as the largest American educational center in the Middle East in which there are students from various countries and particularly from the surrounding Arab countries. It is learnt that the six students dismissed and the four others who will be dismissed are members of the Communist party,. Two of them are from Lebanon, four from Iraq and two from Transjordan. But as for the reason of dismissal it is on account of the decision taken by the University that they should not employ their position in the University for propaganda of foreign political parties.

Special Political Committee gn the Arab Refugees' Problem that it is not important to offer necessary allowances to the Agency for execution of plans or the amount of donations or the nature of projects suggested asall these would not help the plan fundamentally i.e., it has no connection with a justified en- quiry into the refugees problems as an assurance forreturning them to their homeland or to compensate those who do not wish to return according to the decision taken by the U.N. in December, 1948. That decision was turned down through the Anglo-American influence immediately it was found that Israel objects. It was substitud by the plan for collecting donations. The non-return of refugees to their homeland only assist in their being replaced by Jews and secondly donations do not help their condition at all as they will remain away from their country. These are not helpful as they do not differ from the previous projects suggested and already failed. The only result we can foresee is that such steps would only facilitate the carrying out of the plans of the Reconciliation Commission whose inten- tion was to keep the Arab Palestinians away from their country which condition is being very strongly opposed by the Arab countries.

The aim of the U.S.A. outcomed a series of projects for the assistance of the European countries, countries in Asia and Africa, Middle East and Far East to enable them to face any probable events through a clash between east and west. Amongst these were Marshal plans, President Truman. f s Point IV Aid Progranme and Economical Aid Projects passed by the Congress according to which vast amount was granted to a great number of countries in Asia and Europe. All these countries made use of the opportunity and received all what they required for their construction and development plans which amounted to three milliards of ]dollars. It reformed the economical conditions in European countttLes that have been damaged during the war. The attitude of the U.S.A. has been hostile towards the Arab countries since the end of the second war up to the present and particularly on the question of Palestine, therefore, the Arbb countries refrained from requesting for such help and the Americans themselves have been occupied in offering Military, Technical, Economical and Financail aid to Zionists. But lately attention have been drawn to this matter and some of the countries amongst whom were Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon have made request to the UN for loans for the purpose of carrying out their economical projects. Iraq and Syria have made their request to IBRD for which a mission is now visiting countries to study the financial. and economical conditions and to submit a report to IBRD in connection with the grant of an international loan amounting to five million pounds on J% interest.

In an exclusive interview with the Az-Zaman reporter and the \"A1-Ahram\" correspondent in Baghdad, King Abdullah passed some remarks. Asked about the proposed four-nation plan for interna- tionalizing the holy places, he stated that he still expects full information from the Jordanian delegation at Lake Success. He added that he has no objection to international supervision of the maintenance of the holy places provided that \"Jordan retains responsibility for peace and order.\" Asked about Egypto-Jordan relations, the King said that a \"Brotherly spirit of cooperation exists.\" He stressed that there is no question of \"subservience.\" About Syria, he expressed the opinion that the 'prevailing turmoil will lead to \"unity of Syria\"; and asserted, \"I shall not change my opinion.\" Asked whether efforts are being made in this sense, he said, \"There are none, but the right way is clear; stability is inevitably on the footstep of unstability.\" Asked about the incorporation into one state of the Arab sheikhdoms on the Persian Gulf, King Abdulla discounted the rumor as a \"dream of the press which I have not heard of. Asked whether Chinese intervention into the Korean war will lead to a world war, he stated that war already exists be- tween Communism and Democracy. Asked whether the present economic conditions in the Arab countries may prevent Communism from spreading, he said that Communism is professed by \"who has no religious sense.\" In the end, he blamed \"Al-Ahram\" newspaper of having abandoned its usual gravity by joining the rest of the Egyptian press in a campaign against his person.

(A1-Akhbar) EDITORIAL COMMENTS. Commenting on the Chinese intervention in Korea, Sada Al-Ahali doubts there is a real intervention on the part of Mao's China. It interprets the change in the course of the military operations as due to a regrouping of the North Korean forces. \"The matter,\" it says, may be but a new act of provocation on the part of the U.S. against the People's Republic of China.\" The Chinese forces operating in North Korea are described as \"'volunteers\", which were encouraged to enlist by the Red Chinese Premier to repel the \"aggression\" against North Korea. The paper expresses the fear that the Korean-Manchurian border plays the same role of the 38th parallel and that the Americansseek a UN action on the MacArthur report. Indeed, the American plan which amended the UN charter affords the opportunity to override a Soviet veto at the Security Council. Even, it makes easier for MacArthur to get a mandate from the UN than the American Congress itself. The whole matter is that the \"Americans want war, but they are seeking to throw its responsibility on others, while there is none in the world but the U.S. who wants war.\" The Orient is rising, acclaims Al-Yagdha. China and India rid themselves of imperialism. Even, Korea and Indo- China are trying to follow suit. The Arabs should strive to ensure their unity, lest they remain divided and weak.

Part of them should be in dollar in order to build up our currency reserves.

To answer the demands of the ti' Western military experts, the proposed projects consist of a network of military roads from Northern Saudi Arabia to Turkey and Iran, the expansion of military airfields, and the repair of the Aqaba harbor. But, says Fuad Tarzi, the U.S. policy is contradicting itself. It wants to win Arab friendship, and pursues a hostile policy. It refused to supply Egypt with arms,'and the Congress committee led by Senator Pepper after touring the Arab countries recommended that Israel be provided with American arms and ammunitions. Moreover, the U.S. at'the UN voted against Egypt's candidature to the Social Council and against Lebanon's to the Security Council. ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREAT. Speaking of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, Mohammed Hadid stated, \"Egypt is right to consider its 1936 treaty as null and void. It became unbinding upon the setting up of the UN after World ''Jar II, which has taken charge of ensuring peace in the world. Thus, military alliances became unopportune; besides, the Anglo-Egyptian treaty and the like are a violation of na- tional sovereignty and are inconsistent with national aspira-` tions. and the UN charter. \"The Egyptian government should not only declare it null and void but also act accordingly by considering the presence iof British troops over its territories as an act of aggression..\" (Az-Daman. 10/30) Approved For Release 2005/02/14: CIA-RDP83-00415R00680007000T$ 5bmpt ed ...

Such a type of treaty is considered as null and void. Indeed, it has become \"the duty\" of \"oppressed\" peoples to abolish these \"imperialistic\" ties. Commenting on the. statement made by the acting Egyptian Foreign Minister that the Egyptian government means to take the necessary action to cancel the 193b treaty, if Anglo-Egyptian relations continue on the present trend, Liwa Al-Istiglal (10/30) says, \"No Iraqi heard the statement without cheering it\". The British, says the paper, understand but force. Egypt and Iraq have never been the \"property of Britain; and the Arab nation, the \"slave of the British people\" . The fact, that the statement comes after the Bevin-Salahid- din talks, indicates thit the British \"still attempt at forcing Egypt to subdue tothe 1936 treaty.\" 25X1 As from November 2, office hours of the government will be from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day, and from 9 a.m. to 1:30,p.m. on Thursdays only.

General Sami Hannawi, who led the Syrian coup d'etat No. 2, was shot dead in Beirut by 30-year-old P-ohammed Al-Barazi. The assassin is the cousin of Dr. ilohsen Al-Barazi who, as the Prime Minister of Hosni Az-Zayim was executed by a squad upon Hannawi's order. (Az-Zaman) \"Hannawi died a martyrdom.\" says Liwa Al-Istialal. \"Hannawi,\" adds the paper, \"as the other who believe in the right of this nation to freedom and unity, was favoring Syro- Iraqi union, but within the constitutional framework; therefore, he refrained from any action of his own and left the matter to the authorities in Syria. His greatest concern was that the Army stays remote from politics and that Syrian statesmen are accorded full freedom of action.\" \"Today,\" says Alm a, \"Syria's great hero is murdered by a sinful criminal inspired by revenge to the detriment of .3 million Syrians who, with the rest of the Arabs, see in Sami Hannawi a fearless general.??. The paper praises Sami Hannawi for his daring overthrow of the \"dictatorial\" regime of Hosni Az-ayim, and for his humility and soldiership because after having rid the country of Az-Zayim he handed the authority over to the politicians. The paper hopes that this \"catastrophe\" will make Syrian statesmen realize to what extent conditions have \"deteriorated\" in Syria. It sends \"across the artificial frontiers\" separat- ing Iraq and Syria its \"warm condolences\" for the loss of Syria's \"pillar of pillars\". t The death ip of Sami iannawi, the \"hero\" of the second coup d etat and the liberator' of Syria from Az-La im's ranny, is not a d'I: ZO& 'or f&asetm5/02# (Ik Q0415 6ffgft t?-7was \"not an......

He should have been induced to live in some Arab country where he could be protected against such an outrage. \"Hannawi was flattered for some time by union proponents, but with his downfall he lived in oblivion until he met such a painful death.\" VICTIMS OF TRIBAL F ZOCEDURE MISTAKE PARDONES. A new prodecural rule of tribal jurisprudence is shaped up. It consists that the Minister of Interior when revising a judgment passed by an administrative official under the tribal law has no right to reverse acquittal or release to an imprisonment term, but he should follow the usual criminal procedure of quashing the decision and referring it again to the administrative official. This procedure was ruled by the Codification Department on October 16, 1950 and by a 3-man judicial committee on October 26, 1950. In order to undo the injustices committed since 1945, the Ministry of Interior recommended to the Council of Ministers to remit by Royal Irada the terms of persons who are victims of such a mistake of procedure. Indeed, a Royal Irada was issued remitting \"the rest of terms of persons condemned to imprisonment by the Minister of Interior or the person authorized.by him in accordance with the Tribal Law, as from the beginning of 1945, in cases where a decision of acquittal or released was passed by the adminis- trative official, but the Minister of Interior or the person authorized by him condemned them to imprisonment despite the decision of acquittal or release before referring the case to the appropriate official for revising the decision of. acquittal or release..\" (Ai-Nabaa) Approved For Release 2005/02/14 ~`Cih-RDP83-00415R006800070002-7 ANGLO------ Approved For Release 2005/02/14: CIA-RDP83-00415R006800070002-7 - 3 - October 31, 1950, ZGL G-IRAQI ii INANC IAL TALKS TO BEGIN TOMORROW.

THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY'S FIFTH-ANNUAL RALLY. Yesterday morning, the Independence Party held its fifth annual rally, Leader Mohammed Mahdi Kubba delivered a speech on foreign polic and Deputy-Leader Faiq As-Samerrai on internal affairs. Mohammed Mahdi Kubba spoke of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty, ,Palestine, the Syro-I'ragT\"`Union, the Arab League, and its popular counterpart, the Arab Common Defense Treaty, the East- West conflict, and the Tripartite Declaration. He branded the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty as the \"source of all. the existing evils in Iraq.\" He asserted its being \"null and void\", because it was concluded under duress, it provides for \"unequal.\" obligations, and it \"violates\" the UN Charter.. The 1930 treaty, he said, enables Britain to \"impose\" on Iraq a \"policy inspired by the imperialistic-mentality of the 19th century.\" Therefore, the party's \"primary goal in pursuit of drastic reform is to strive for full sovereignty immaculated from such a tyrannic treaty and for speedy evacuation of all foreign troops.\" Regarding Palestine, he warned against the Anglo-American policy of managing a \"final settlement with the Jews by means of some lenient Arab politicians.\" He asserted that the \"libera- tion of Palestine will remain.a fundamental aim of the Arab na- tion.\" He called for \"all-out economic boycott\" of Israel. He described the Syro-Iraqi Union ass the \"first step to establishing an impregnable barrier against Zionist expansion, and to the greater unity of the Arab countries.\" He blamed the Arab League for \"inefficiency\" and urged the formation of the \"Popular League.\" About the Arab Common Defense Treaty, he is \"doubtful\" aboutAp vvd bi8*aee' 2?O5i 2/t416b4aRDR8\"J1g 68QQ071)QP1 dangers. 25X1 25X1 25X1 However...

The condition is that \"our national aspirations be fulfilled, the West's errors towards the Arabs in general and Palestine in particular be corrected, and we be treated as the Western camp does the NAT nations.\" The purport of \"siding\" was fur- ther interpreted as \"armed mentality\", which was explained as meaning that \"Iraq or any Arab bloc Iraq is member thereof would neither be hostile to the West nor defend the East.\" He denounced the Tripartite Declaration as being \"conceived to enforce the present status, to stabilize the armistice lines and to divide: the Arab countries into spheres of imperialistic influence.\" He pointed to the \"imperialistic conspiracies\" re Libya, North Africa, and the Arab S'^eikhdoms, and made it the task of the Arab states to \"rescue\" them. Faiq As-Samerrai spoke of internal affairs. He put the blame for the \"bad conditions\" on the \"ruling class for resorting to unconstitutional means.\" He called for \"general suffrage\" and \"full political\" rights to women. He asserted that the \"only outlet\" for Iraq is \"national democratic socialism\", with a minimum living standard, a maxi- mum limit of landownership, progressive taxation on landlords, distribution of lands and a social security system.

Speaking of Libya's independence, Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi ('1_1/6) says that \"Arab circles received the UN Political Coiiiiriitte; is decision with deep satisfaction.\" But, certain activities on the part of Britain and the U.S. \"give rise to fear.\" American contingents have just arrived there. Ambassador Caffery is to visit Libya. Anglo-American military maneuvers are to take place there, In the end, the paper pays tribute to the Iraqi delega- tion to the UN for its \"courageous struggle for Libya's independ- ence and freedom.\" Commenting on the deadlocked Moroccan-French negotiations for self-rule in Morocco, As-Si it (11/6) says that French refusal to make real concessions \"gives an evidence of France's hostility and ill-intention\" towards Morocco. The paper fore- casts that nationalist unrest will be resumed shortly, as France is \"again undermining-, \"French-Moroccan relations. The paper says that France \"should realize that the era of ruling peoples with iron and fire is gone.\" It calls on the Arab League and the Arab government to support the Moroccan Sultan in his negotia- tions. Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi (11/6) voices concern about Syria's future, following the assassination of Hannawi.
