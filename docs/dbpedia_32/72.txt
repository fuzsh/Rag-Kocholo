First and foremost, "Tour de France" is a groundbreaking electronic music composition ahead of its time when it was first released in 1983. The track's innovative use of electronic sounds and rhythms paved the way for the emergence of techno and other forms of electronic dance music. It's hard to imagine today's electronic music landscape without the influence of Kraftwerk and "Tour de France."

Moreover, "Tour de France" has significantly impacted hip hop music. The song's catchy synth riff has been sampled by numerous hip hop producers, including Afrika Bambaataa, who used it on his seminal track "Planet Rock."

This sample has been used countless times since then, becoming a staple of hip hop production. But "Tour de France" is more than a great song with an enduring legacy. It has also appeared in several seminal films, making it an essential part of the cultural zeitgeist.

One of the most memorable appearances of the song was in the 1984 film "Breakin'," a classic hip hop movie that showcased the early days of breakdancing and street culture. The film "Tour de France" plays during a scene where the main character, Turbo, a talented breakdancer, performs an electrifying routine that leaves the audience in awe.

The song has also appeared in other influential films, such as "Trainspotting," where it plays during a scene in which the main character, Renton, goes on a drug-fueled bender. The song's hypnotic rhythm and pulsing bassline perfectly capture the film's frenetic energy and sense of disorientation. In addition to its movie appearances, "Tour de France" has been remixed and reinterpreted by countless artists over the years.

One of the most notable remixes was created by the pioneering hip hop producer and DJ Fran√ßois Kevorkian, who turned the track into a dancefloor anthem in the 1990s.
