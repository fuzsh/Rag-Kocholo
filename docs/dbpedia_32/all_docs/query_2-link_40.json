These classes are so much work to create and teach but they are so fun. I am going to miss them! We ended class with a raffle of bike related prizes and at the end I was treated to an on the bike standing ovation. It was humbling and awesome.\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length Tour Profile Workout Rocky Theme Song 4:50 Warm-up The Killers Bones 3:47 Standing run with pushes Volbeat A Warriorâ€™s Call 4:22 Booty Backs Darude Sandstorm 3:44 Flat & Fast Fast run with fun facts about the Tour Papa Roach Lifeline 4:06 False Flat Standing fast climb with attacks â€“ teams together Shinedown Simple Man 4:25 Up Heavy Hill â€“ seated / attack.

Todayâ€™s profile was flat and FAST. The 5:30 AM class was small so instead of having team captains the entire class got the chance to jump ahead for the win. I loved that so much I decided to use that methodology going forward. The only rule? They couldnâ€™t be a prior winner. Everyone gets a chance at the prize! We had a photo finish in the evening â€“ that makes 2 this tour. So many twists and turns, in the real tour and in the spin room ðŸ™‚\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length Tour Profile Workout Jorge Quintero 100 Violin Orchestra on repeat until finish intro Warm-up Train Driveby 3:17 Standing run with pushes Mumford&Sons Roll Away Your Stone 4:21 Booty Backs Ellie King Exâ€™s and Ohâ€™s 3:22 False Flat Standing fast climb with attacks (teams together) Steppenwolf Born To Be Wild 3:30 Downhill :30 on / :30 off sprints (teams alternating) Fall Out Boys Centuries 3:48 Short and Steep Uphill :20 / :20 / :20 (sit / stand / attack up) The Killers A Dustland Fairytale 3:46 Down Increasing speed down with the music (teams together Beyonce Crazy in Love 3:10 Steep Uphill with a flat across the top Steep uphill Fountains of Wayne Hey Julie 2:37 Flat across the top of the hill Break Aerosmith Eat The Rich 4:11 Flat and fast :20/:20/:20s- alternating teams Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band American Storm 4:18 :30 / :30 sprints â€“ alternating teams Blue October Drop 4:36 Short and steep Rolling hill with the song, both teams together Rollers Haik Naltchayan The Will of a Man 1:32 Intro To The End â€“ winner does a :20 standing attack into a sprint to the bottom Shinedown Devour 3:50 Fast and flat to the end Fast â€“ up to the winner when we start sprinting Billy Joel All About Soul 6:01 Cool-down John Legend All of Me 4:29 Stretching\n\nOur 2nd tour ride was another hit. Happy faces early on a Saturday morningâ€¦well happy until my team captains took over. Husband vs wife â€“ it got ugly! Accusations of cheating commenced! Luckily itâ€™s all in good fun ðŸ™‚\n\nToday we were in the Pyrenees. One of our fun facts was the small issue of llamas possibly getting in the way of the riders. Yes, you read and are looking at that correctly. As if the Pyrenees mountains werenâ€™t enough!\n\nBack on a class note I am absolutely obsessed with Imagine Dragonâ€™s Warriors. OMG â€“ what an amazing climb song! I had to re-write the workout to follow it up with stronger climbs. It is AWESOME. We didnâ€™t have time to do long climbs so they were all really heavy, mostly 9s and a few 10s sprinkled in.\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length Tour Profile Workout Rudy Theme 4:20 Warm-up Billy Idol Rebel Yell 3:45 Standing run with pushes Volbeat A Warriorâ€™s Call 4:22 Booty Backs Bond Explosive 3:24 Flat and Fast Run â€“ fun facts about the tour and get your legs under you Imagine Dragons Warriors 2:50 Longest Hill Short and Steep â€“ Add resistance every minute Fall Out Boys Centuries 3:48 3x through :30 each: seated climb / standing climb / attack.
