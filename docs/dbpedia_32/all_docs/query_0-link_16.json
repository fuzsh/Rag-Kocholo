It’s more energetic and syncopated than anything the ‘Werk had done before, and its tapestry of climbing music-box melodies, aerobic breaths and vocal exertions is pure tone poetry. The 12-inch’s ‘bonus beats’ buzz and crackle, much as a rider’s head must sound after his daily performance-enhancing drug cocktail.”\n\nGarry Mulholland in “This Is Uncool – The 500 Greatest Singles since Punk and Disco”"
