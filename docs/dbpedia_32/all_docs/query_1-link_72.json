        "text": "Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS World Tour is fully underway and new stops keep being added. The day after her show-stopping 2023 VMAs performance, the musician announced that she'd be hitting the road and heading out on an over 60-stop tour in support of her critically acclaimed sophomore album.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo wrote most of GUTS — which was released on September 8, 2023 — when she was 19 years old, and it's a deeply personal (but extremely relatable) album that she was thrilled to share with her fans. “I made the bulk of this album during my 19th year on this earth, a year that, for me, was filled with lots of confusion, mistakes, awkwardness, and good old-fashioned teen angst,” 20-year-old Rodrigo wrote before its release. “I cannot express how excited I am to embark on this new chapter of my life with you guys.”\n\nBelow, find out everything you need to know about Olivia Rodrigo's 2024 GUTS World Tour.\n\n→ Exact tour dates (updated)\n\n→ Ticketing\n\n→ GUTS World Tour Bus Experience\n\n→ Opening acts\n\n→ Announcement\n\n→ Charities\n\nWhen and where did the Olivia Rodrigo GUTS World Tour kick off?\n\nThe tour began in Palm Springs, California, on February 23, 2024. Rodrigo started the tour in the United States and Canada and will continue throughout Europe for much of the spring and early summer before heading back to the United States in July. Initially, we thought the tour would officially wrap on August 17, 2024, in California with four final Los Angeles shows, but she announced new stops across Asia and Australia on May 8, 2024, via social media. Even more dates were added after the initial announcement, which you can see below.\n\nThat's not all: Rodrigo also announced two extra Los Angeles dates, this time at the Intuit Dome and not the Kia Forum, on June 17, 2024. Tickets for the new L.A. dates go on sale on June 21, 2024.\n\nWho is joining Olivia Rodrigo on tour?\n\nThe GUTS World Tour has a packed slate of opening acts. Chappell Roan, Remi Wolf, Benee, and The Breeders have all joined or will join Rodrigo on select dates across the tour. PinkPantheress was also an opening act, but on August 1, 2024, she announced she was pulling out of the rest of the tour, citing health reasons.\n\n“It is with the heaviest heart that I sadly have to announce that I will not be able to continue with the rest of my live shows this year in order to focus on my physical health and overall well-being,” the British star wrote on IG stories. “It appears I have reached a wall which I am struggling to penetrate through. This will include my GUTS tour, Field Day, Summer Sonic, FORM, Ill Points, and Australia/NZ appearances. I would like to thank all of you, as well as my touring team and Olivia for giving me the platform to perform some super fun shows. I'm sad to disappoint anyone and can only hope we will be in each other's company once I return to health.”\n\nWhat's the GUTS World Tour Bus Experience?\n\nThe GUTS World Tour Bus Experience first debuted in spring 2024, during the first American leg of Rodrigo's tour. The Bus is back this summer for the second leg, making stops across the country until September when Rodrigo takes her show across the globe to Asia and Australia.\n\nThe GWT Bus Experience is an immersive pop-up accessible to all fans, at both tour venues and local spots, with or without concert tickets. The bus is presented by American Express, Sony LinkBuds S, and Dr. Martens; Amex Card Members receive perks onsite, like a complimentary gift with any purchase made with an eligible card and exclusive apparel available only to card members (while supplies last).\n\nAll fans regardless of Amex Card Member status will also be able to enter a giveaway for tickets to the local area's show and receive a complimentary set of holographic Olivia x Amex trading cards.\n\nFirework content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nApart from the bus itself, there's a special tour photo booth, a postcard writing tent, and a customization station hosted by Dr. Martens where fans have the opportunity to personalize and decorate their newly bought merch or their own concert outfits. Plus, fans who wear Dr. Martens boots to the Bus Experience receive a free pair of Olivia-inspired shoelaces and a special Olivia-inspired D.M. coupon and boot charm offer starting July 23.\n\nThe Bus Experience is an interactive pop-up designed to mimic a '90s teenage girl's bedroom, complete with tour memorabilia, an exhibit case of outfits worn by Rodrigo on the SOUR tour, a mirrored vanity and a vintage TV, a Polaroid wall, a “Bad Idea Right?” neon sign, and many a photo opp, like a replica of the crescent moon used in the live GUTS set and a star-filled toilet for you to spill ur GUTS in.\n\nFans are also able to test out the Rodrigo-designed Sony LinkBuds S x Olivia Rodrigo earbuds — if bought onsite, a limited edition Olivia O's cereal box will be gifted along with purchase. Check out the dates and locations below to see when the GUTS World Tour Bus will stop near you!\n\nWhere can I get tickets, and how much do they cost?\n\nAccording to a press release, fans are being asked to register before tickets go on sale in an effort to reduce bots and resales. You can register for your tickets on Ticketmaster here — American Express cardholders may be able to unlock early access.\n\nWhile standard tickets in the U.S. retail between $49.50 and $199.50 plus taxes and fees, Rodrigo is also introducing Silver Star Tickets, a limited number of $20 tickets (plus taxes and fees) to “make it as easy and affordable as possible for her fans to make it out to her shows.” These must be purchased in pairs, and seat locations will be revealed on the day of the show.\n\nWhat else do I need to know about the GUTS World Tour?\n\nThere's a charitable arm of the tour! Rodrigo is launching the Fund 4 Good, “a global initiative committed to building an equitable and just future for all women and girls through direct support of community-based non-profits that champion girls’ education, support reproductive rights and prevent gender-based violence.” A portion of proceeds from all ticket sales will go to support the fund.\n\nThe GUTS World Tour is making a total of 84 stops across the globe. Dates added before the original announcement are marked below with an asterisk."
