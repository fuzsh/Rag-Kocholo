        "text": "In an interview with the New York Times, Kraftwerk’s Ralf Hütter revealed that the groundbreaking electronic group’s next album is coming “soon.”\n\nTrending\n\n“We didn’t fall asleep,” said Hütter, the band’s sole remaining original member. “The 168-hour week is still going on since the beginning, since 1970.” Beyond confirming that the new album is “under way,” Hütter did not elaborate. The album would be the group’s first since 2003’s Tour de France Soundtracks.\n\n“Kraftwerk is a living organism,” explained Hütter. “Music is never finished. It starts again tomorrow.”"
