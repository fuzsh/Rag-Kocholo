        "text": "This is a new idea I had: Highlighting a specific song from the discography of a recently deceased musician. I’ll try to pick album cuts or relatively unknown recordings, mostly because everyone else is gonna be talking about the hits. This time I’m talking about the original machine man, the electronic pioneer Florian Schneider, his group Kraftwerk, and their song “Europa Endlos.”\n\nLike Florian Schneider, I moved to the German city of Düsseldorf to study. I only lived there for one year, but it was still an incredible time in my life, where I got to explore different cultures and hang out with people from across Europe. If there’s one thing I regret about that period though, it’s not knowing Düsseldorf was the city where Kraftwerk recorded most of their important records. I would’ve definitely tried to locate Kling Klang, the band’s private studio, and take a guided tour, or at least pose like a robot for a selfie outside.\n\nThinking about it now, it’s weird I haven’t figured out Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter, Kraftwerk’s de-facto leaders, created their art in Düsseldorf. In many ways, the group’s music reflects the city as I remember it: Unmistakably German yet open to the world, reliant on both efficient technology and personal interaction, occasionally cold and rigid with constant warmth hidden in plain sight. Schneider and his bandmates might’ve adopted the personae of German-made automatons performing functions – and been parodied for it countless times – but they’ve really been more like tin men on a quest for a beating heart that’s been inside them all along.\n\nThe cyborg aesthetic, the repetitive electronic beats and the deadpan vocals might give off a dystopian impression, as if the mechanized style warns of a future with no human emotion. But just as they exaggerated Teutonic rigor to reveal the sincerity behind it, Schneider and Hütter used their robotic image to show their fascination with the ways in which technology can advance humankind and connect people. It’s this fascination that spurred them to name their 1977 album after a European cross-border train system, and open that album with a lengthy composition celebrating their interconnected continent.\n\n“Europa Endlos” is over 9 minutes long, but the passage of time is hardly noticeable. It’s a surprisingly chirpy song, right from the first synth line which plays by itself for about 40 seconds. It takes another minute for the sequenced percussion to kick in, and the vocals enter right at the 2-minute mark. In different hands, such an extended buildup could feel stagnant, but here it emits grandeur and elicits anticipation, like an overture to a stage epic. This extended intro also reminds me of The Who’s “Baba O’Riley,” not melodically but in the sense of presenting both the concept of the album and the electronic instruments of narration. After all, both Kraftwerk and The Who took R&B rhythms and gave them their own decidedly European interpretations.\n\nOf course, Kraftwerk wore their continental heritage more proudly. The concept of the Trans Europa Express album is the shared fate of European countries – at least Western ones – symbolized by the titular multinational railway service. So the propulsive rhythm is also meant to mimic a chugging train – bandmember Karl Bartos even mentioned they wanted to use actual railroad sounds before realizing they weren’t danceable. Regardless of their sources of inspiration, on “Europa Endlos” Schneider and Hütter fully give away their excitement about the various possibilities offered by technology, not least by the new type of sequencer they received before recording the album.\n\nIt’s not just the arrangement, where each layer is a hook in itself, that conveys this enthusiasm. It’s also present in the song’s sparse lyrics, co-written by Schneider and Hütter. They describe different sights in Europe, which are now much closer thanks to transnational transportation. But unlike what might be expected of Kraftwerk, these marvels are not fully automated factories, large screen TVs, or any other form of advanced technology. Instead, the song mentions simpler, more traditional landmarks, first architectural (“Parks, palaces and hotels“) and then geographical (“Rivers, mountains, forests“). For Florian Schneider, machines are not meant to replace nature or civilization, only to make them more accessible.\n\nI deliberately chose to translate the lyrics in the original German version of the song, rather than just pick the English version released at the same time. The two versions are nearly identical, except that “Europe Endless” replace the line about nature with a reference to “Promenades and avenues,” which makes the song lose some of its charm in my opinion. On the other hand, the mere existence of an entire Trans-Europe Express album in English is a manifestation of the band’s international vision. A few years after celebrating transportation within a national German context – and scoring their first global hit in the process – this project proves their commitment to a more open-border identity.\n\nThe importance of “Europa Endlos” as the manifesto of Kraftwerk’s new mentality is highlighted by its reiteration at the end of the album, on the somewhat similar sounding “Franz Schubert” which segues into the final reprise, “Endlos Endlos.” As both tracks contain no percussion, there’s no revival of the frankly ingratiating moments on “Europa Endlos” where the drum pattern suddenly changes before going back to its originally programmed sound. These glitches feel too random, and I assume they were just a result of working with new equipment for the first time. But they only add to the magic of the track, as the moments of human error make it sound, well, human. And finding humanity in the machinery was indeed the whole idea."
