        "text": "When Chad Haga called his dad, Chris, in October 2010, he hesitated to speak his mind.\n\nHaga had spent four and a half years working toward a mechanical engineering degree at Texas A&M and earned a job offer after graduating that winter. But Haga also had a passion for cycling, and the few opportunities to join elite teams post-grad weighed on him when he reached out to his dad.\n\nHis father had recently been diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer, so when the idea of Haga pursuing professional cycling finally came up, Haga received his dad's best wishes to follow his dreams while able. The conversation started the journey that led Haga from a young kid who experimented with his bike while growing up in McKinney to a professional support rider participating in this year's Tour de France.\n\nHaga currently is in the Top 70 in the Tour standings as an individual after 13 stages. His team, Team Sunweb, ranks 7th.\n\n\"My biggest concern was what my parents would think about passing up a certain job opportunity so that I could scrape by as a cyclist hoping to make a career out of it,\" Haga said in an email from France during a recent day off from competition. \"When he encouraged me to chase my dreams wholeheartedly, that was all I needed to hear.\"\n\nHaga moved with his family to McKinney in 1998, and at 12 or 13 years old, learned about mountain biking from a friend. That turned into him playing around on his bike in the streets, building ramps and practicing tricks.\n\nHe didn't take lessons or receive much formal coaching before he graduated from McKinney in 2006, but Haga developed his abilities by entering as an individual in Dallas Off Road Bicycle Association races, and he continued to seek competition upon enrolling at Texas A&M.\n\nIn College Station, Haga became president of the Texas A&M cycling team. When it was the offseason for mountain biking, Haga trained in road cycling. He spent his final summer in college traveling around the country to race. Haga was cycling so often that his dad, who passed away in 2016, started a photography business to shoot his rides and try to recoup some money the family was spending on cycling equipment and gear.\n\n\"He excelled in college in his races,\" Haga's mom, DeLayne, said.\n\nAfter graduating and turning down that job offer with Texas Instruments, where he had previously interned, Haga joined an elite team, the sport's version of a semi-pro level, and worked his way through the professional hierarchy.\n\nAs he established consistency with podium finishes at races, Haga first earned a promotion to a domestic professional team, and he now lives most of the year in Girona, Spain, and races for Team Sunweb.\n\n\"His curve is very sharp in his improvement,\" said David Wenger, who worked with Haga in biomechanics via Durata Training in Austin.\n\nHaga's path to international success wasn't always smooth, though. While riding back from a training session in Spain with his team in January 2016, Haga was at the front of the group as it came around a blind turn just as a woman was driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\n\"It's a miracle that none of them were killed,\" said DeLayne, who saw pictures of the scene -- broken bikes and several injured riders -- and witnessed her son's recovery from being airlifted to a hospital with a wounded neck and fractured eye socket.\n\nBut after two weeks, Haga started to ride a stationary training bike in his apartment. After two months, he returned to competition. And after nine months, he felt he had regained the mental confidence and competitiveness that makes him who Wenger estimates is one of three Texas-raised talents to reach the sport's top level in the modern, post-steroid era.\n\nPatrick McCarty of Allen is now the men's team director at Rally Cycling, and Lawson Craddock of Houston is currently riding in the Tour de France, too, despite suffering a fractured scapula and facial laceration in the opening stage.\n\nThere are others, such as Plano native Lance Armstrong, who've reached, or surpassed, similar heights in cycling, Wenger said, \"but they were at the highest level of the sport when it was very dirty.\" In 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his seven consecutive Tour de France titles from 1999-2005 after admitting he used performance-enhancing drugs during much of his career.\n\n\"It's just a whole different generation,\" Wenger said. \"It's really good to see this new crew of well-articulated, young folks.\"\n\nHaga wasn't originally projected to ride in the Tour de France this year, as his team had released an early list and he wasn't on it. But one of his teammates had to pull out, and he learned the Tour de France might be a possibility when the Sunweb director pulled him aside the morning before the final stage of Giro d'Italia in May.\n\nAbout a week later, he received a message while hiking in Girona that he would start the tour, and he didn't have any trouble delivering the news when he called his mom.\n\n\"My first reaction was goosebumps,\" Haga said via email. \"I realized that I would finally achieve a life goal.\""
