        "text": "Kraftwerk's first new album in 17 years shows again that nobody does electronic conceptual perfection like the Teutonic pioneers.\n\nWhere Autobahn eulogised motoring and Computer World romanticised the then-imminent digital era, these cycling-themed tracks are created with an almost breathtaking attention to detail: whirring chains, beating hearts and sounds of panting.\n\nFour tracks are based on 1983's classic Tour de France, but are barely recognisable. The completely new material, meanwhile, will set pulses racing. Titanium (named after the bike-frame metal) and Aero Dynamik are heady electronic symphonies, while Vitamin is an appropriate techno pop booster.\n\nTheir notorious humour remains desert dry: Ralf HÃ¼tter's vocoder has acquired a French accent, and only Kraftwerk could get away with the hilariously deadpan Elektro Kardiogramm, about a heart monitor.\n\nIncreased production values mean Kraftwerk sound better than before, and even if they're no longer miles ahead as they once were, there is still no one else who sounds simultaneously so quaint and so futuristic.\n\nQuintessential Kraftwerk, and almost worth the wait."
