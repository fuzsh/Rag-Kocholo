        "text": "Check out the incredible Ultimate CF SLX – a new model by German manufacturers Canyon Bicycles, made in collaboration with Düsseldorf electronica pioneers Kraftwerk.\n\nManufactured in an extremely limited edition of 21, the Ultimate CF SLX promises a Grand Tour-winning frameset, a SRAM Red electronic gear shifting system, Zip 303 Firecrest wheels and – most importantly for techno fans – a geometric black and white design inspired by artwork by Kraftwerk’s founding member Ralf Hütter. Each reflective strip was apparently cut to measure and hand-laid, taking a total of seven hours per frameset to complete.\n\nKraftwerk and cycling have long gone hand in hand. The group released the single Tour-De-France in 1983, and in 2015 Hütter – in a rare interview with Rolling Stone – rhapsodised about the bicycle life and the influence cycling has on their music. “We are very interested in the dynamics and the energy and the movement. The German word is vorwärts, forward — that's what you do with your bicycle.”\n\nIn a statement, Canyon CEO Roman Arnold spoke about the creative collaboration. “My memories of partying in friends’ basements as a teenager are dominated by hearing Kraftwerk’s groundbreaking sounds,” he said. “Kraftwerk and cycling have a special and unique connection – their music, and all that they do, has inspired our work at Canyon in so many ways across the years. It is an unbelievable honour for us to pay respect to everything that Kraftwerk stands for and has achieved in such a fitting way with these stunning bikes.”\n\nThis year’s Tour de France is hosted in Düsseldorf, Kraftwerk’s home city. Time Trial World Champion Tony Martin will begin the race on a Canyon Speedmax CF SLX bearing the Kraftwerk design, and Kraftwerk will perform Tour De France Soundtracks at a Düsseldorf concert after Saturday’s race.\n\nDespite the Ultimate CF SLX retailing an eye-watering €10,000, the run of 21 bicycles rapidly sold out – no news if they’ll be making more.\n\nCheck out more great premieres, stories and videos at RedBull.com/Music"
