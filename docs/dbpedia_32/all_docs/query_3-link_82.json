        "text": "The band started life when Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter met while at the Robert Schumann Hochschule, a music university in Dusseldorf. At that time there was a lot of German experimental music happening which would be dubbed as the Krautrock scene. Along with a few other students Schneider and Hütter formed a group called Organisation and released an album called ‘Tone Float’. The band split soon after the album was made and around this time Schneider became interested in synthesizers and bought one in 1970. He formed Kraftwerk with Hütter, the name being German for ‘power station’. The early incarnation of the band had a fluctuating line up with other notable German music pioneers, Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger adding guitars and drums to the sound. Dinger would go on to form the band Neu!. At some point during this time Hütter would leave the band for 8 months to concentrate on his studies. While Hütter was ‘on leave’, Kraftwerk released 2 experimental albums simply called ‘Kraftwerk’ and ‘Kraftwerk 2’. In 1973, with Hütter back in the band, they released an album called ‘Ralf Und Florian’ and this marked a move to almost entirely electronic music. 1974 saw their commercial breakthrough as they released ‘Autobahn’. The title track took up the whole of 1 side of the album and lasted over 22 minutes. However, a 3 and a half minute single edit started getting played on a Chicago radio station and the song would eventually get to 25 in the US. A few months later it would climb to 11 in the UK. ‘Autobahn’ and ‘’Trans-Europe Express’ (#67) would be their only US chart hits while in the UK they managed 15 hits with ‘The Model/Computer Love’ going to number 1. Sadly, in 2020 Florian Schneider would succumb to cancer, but Hütter has continued with the band."
