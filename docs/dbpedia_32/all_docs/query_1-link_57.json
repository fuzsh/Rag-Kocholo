        "text": "Over a year into Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, she has found ways to keep the show fresh and new for those who have been waiting since she opened in Phoenix, Arizona in March 2023 to see her. Since the tour began in the United States last year, Swift has released two rerecorded albums — Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in addition to a brand-new double album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nRight as she picked the tour back up in 2024, she flew from Tokyo, Japan to Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada (where she had previously performed) to watch her beau Travis Kelce and his NFL team the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl.\n\nEvery show on the Eras Tour involves an acoustic set where Swift performs at least two songs custom to that night’s show. At first, she wouldn’t allow herself repeats unless she messed up the lyrics to a song, but now, she has done away with that rule and gotten more creative by combining songs in mashups and playing up to four in a segment. The first song or three take place on guitar, and then she shifts to piano for the second half before diving beneath the stage to resume the setlist – which has since contracted and expanded to include a Tortured Poets Department era and set.\n\nBelow you’ll find Taylor Swift’s surprise songs that she has played most recently in Europe as well as a record of all those she has played on the entire tour so far.\n\nInternational Leg 2024\n\nTokyo\n\nFebruary 6 — “Holy Ground” and “Dear Reader”\n\nFebruary 7 — “Eyes Open” and “Electric Touch”\n\nFebruary 8 — “Superman” and “The Outside”\n\nFebruary 9 — “Come In With the Rain” and “You’re On Your Own Kid”\n\nMelbourne\n\nFebruary 16 in — “Red” and “You’re Losing Me”\n\nFebruary 17 — Mashup of “Getaway Car”/”August”/”The Other Side of the Door” and “This Is Me Trying”\n\nSydney\n\nFebruary 18 — Mashup of “Come Back… Be Here”/”Daylight” and “Teardrops on My Guitar”February 23 in Sydney, Australia – “How You Get the Girl” and Mashup of “White Horse/Coney Island” with Sabrina Carpenter\n\nFebruary 24 — “Should’ve Said No (Naur)” and Mashup of “New Year’s Day/Peace”\n\nFebruary 25 — Mashup of “Is It Over Now/I Wish You Would” and Mashup of “Haunted/Exile”\n\nFebruary 26 — Mashup of “Would’ve Could’ve Should’ve/Ivy” and Mashup of “Forever & Always/Maroon”\n\nSingapore\n\nMarch 2 — Mashup of “long story short/The Story of Us” and Mashup of “Clean/evermore”\n\nMarch 3 — Mashup of “Mine/Starlight” and Mashup of “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever/Dress”\n\nMarch 4 — Mashup of “Foolish One/Tell Me Why” and Mashup of “This Love/Call It What You Want”\n\nMarch 7 — Mashup of “Death by a Thousand Cuts/Babe” and Mashup of “Fifteen/You’re On Your Own Kid”\n\nMarch 8 — Mashup of “Sparks Fly/gold rush” and “False God/Slut!”\n\nMarch 9 — Mashup of “Tim McGraw/Cowboy Like Me” and “Mirrorball/Epiphany”\n\nRELATED: ‘Taylor Swift Vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood’ Doc Set At Discovery+ UK\n\nApril 19 – The Tortured Poets Department release day\n\n*Resuming her European tour in 2024 involved an additional set for the record-breaking The Tortured Poets Department complete with 7 staple songs.
