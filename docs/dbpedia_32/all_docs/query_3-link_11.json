        "text": "Ralf Hütter (born in Krefeld, Germany, 1946) is a German singer and musician best known as the leader and one of the co-founders of Kraftwerk.\n\nThrough Kraftwerk, Hütter helped to pioneer and popularize electronic music, adopting the synthesizer as well as self-made electronic instruments and vocoders into the band’s range of equipment. Kraftwerk have even been described as “the world’s most influential band”. After the departure of co-founder and only constant member Florian Schneider, Hütter continued to tour and create music with Kraftwerk."
