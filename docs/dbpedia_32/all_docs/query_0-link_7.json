        "text": "“Tour de France” was released as a single in 1983. The members of Kraftwerk at this time (most notably Ralf Hütter) were dedicated cycling enthusiasts and this song was intended as a homage to the sport’s most famous event. Shortly after the release of this song, Hütter was hospitalized following a serious cycling accident.\n\nThis track was also notable for its distinctive drum beats, and the usage of bicycle sound effects as percussion. Its beats have been heavily sampled and mimicked by several generations of electro, techno and Miami bass artists.\n\nLive Version:"
