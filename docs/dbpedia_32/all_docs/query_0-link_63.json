        "text": "In music, the terms âlegendaryâ and âinfluentialâ are so commonplace as to lose almost all meaning. But it might be argued that More than any other band in history, Kraftwerk were necessary. And if house, trance, techno and synth-pop could talk, theyâd surely agreeâ¦\n\nThe story of Kraftwerk is not dissimilar to that of any other band; like many, it stems from pretty ordinary beginnings. Thereâs not an awful lot to do in DÃ¼sseldorf, and there was even less back in the late 1960s.\n\nAt this time, other key, just-beginning German acts around the country were operating independently of each otherâ¦ and yet theyâd all eventually come to be insultingly labelled as âkrautrockâ as a whole.Â\n\nBack in DÃ¼sseldorf, Florian Schneider (flutes, synthesisers, violin) and Ralf HÃ¼tter (organ, synthesisers) met as students at the Robert Schumann Hochschule.\n\nParticipating in the local experimental music and art scene, they formed Organisation with Basil Hammoudi (glockenspiel, conga gong, musical box, bongos, percussion, vocals), Butch Hauf (bass and something mysteriously called âshaky tubeâ), and Fred Monicks (drums and percussion), although this was not Schneiderâs first foray into music, having been in the amazingly named PISSOFF in 1968.\n\nTwo become four\n\nThe transition into Kraftwerk began pretty much immediately. Heavily influenced by art duo Gilbert and George, HÃ¼tter and Schneider sought to make Kraftwerk a life and art experience.\n\nThe first two albums â Kraftwerk (released 1970) and Kraftwerk 2 (1972) â were produced by Conny Plank and were mostly experimental freeform affairs.\n\nAs HÃ¼tter explained to Uncut in 2009, âWe were finding Kraftwerk, setting up the Kling Klang studio, finding musicians to work with, discovering composition, discovering the German language, human voice, synthetic voice.\n\n“Me and Florian had our Kling Klang studio since 1970. And one day we said: âOK, there must be a mothership, a laboratory, a studio HQ where we put things together.ââ\n\nBy the end of 1973, Wolfgang FlÃ¼r had joined the pair. FlÃ¼r had form already, having been in an early band with Michael Rother called The Spirit Of Sound in the late 1960s.\n\nAnother figure significant at this point was Emil Schult, who would work with HÃ¼tter and Schneider on the comic and artwork for the next album and would contribute much to Kraftwerkâs visual identity.\n\nBy the end of 1973, HÃ¼tter and Schneider had released Ralf And Florian. A move towards synths and drum machines, this was the genesis of what Kraftwerk were to become.\n\nKraftwerk took a giant leap forwards in 1974 with the release of their fourth album, Autobahn.\n\nWhile not a fully electronic affair â there were still violins and flutes in the mix â Autobahn was a distillation of all their ideas to date, with a predominantly electronic-based sound, as well as more Vocoder, as on the title track, mimicking the âfun fun funâ of The Beach Boys.\n\nKraftwerk was now a quartet, with the addition of experimental musician Klaus RÃ¶der, playing treated violins (despite appearing on the sleeve of the album, Roder didnât last long, and left before its release).\n\nRead more: Making Kraftwerk’s Autobahn\n\nA radio edit of the title track, whittled down from 22 minutes to a more digestible four, saw it reach No.11 in the UK singles chart, and the album itself remains their highest charting release at No.4.\n\nThe band also made their first UK television appearance on Tomorrowâs World in September 1975, almost a year after the release of the album and five months after the success of the single in the UK.Â\n\nThe truth was, however, that Autobahn was something of a novelty hit in these territories.\n\nThe edit had been getting extended airplay, first in Chicago and then the rest of the US, but it was still seen as a weird bit of instrumental otherness to be filed alongside Hot Butterâs Popcorn or even Lieutenant Pigeonâs honkytonk piano theme Mouldy Old Dough.\n\nWave power\n\nAny plans by Kraftwerk to capitalise on that new fame wasnât evident with the follow-up, 1975âs Radio-Activity.\n\nHÃ¼tter had become fascinated with the number of privately-owned radio stations in the US and was very into the idea of the band having its own private station.\n\nOf course, the term âradioactivityâ had another connotation, and in case you missed it, there were tracks entitled Geiger Counter and Uranium (in the early 1990s Kraftwerk would update the title track for The Mix album to prevent the song being seen as a hymn to nuclear power, mentioning Chernobyl, Hiroshima and Harrisburg â all sites of nuclear-based catastrophes â and prefixing the chorus with âStopâ ahead of âradio-activityâ).\n\nRadio-Activity was the first album to be performed by the âclassicâ Kraftwerk line-up of HÃ¼tter, Schneider, Karl Bartos and Wolfgang FlÃ¼r.\n\nIt was also the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by HÃ¼tter and Schneider in their Kling Klang studio.\n\nThe independence went further: the music was published by their own Kling Klang Verlag company, giving them much greater financial control over the use of their songs. At Kling Klang, they had become fully self-sufficient in their own world.Â\n\nThough at the time Radio-Activity suffered poor sales and received few encouraging reviews, it is now considered one of their key works, as David Stubbs suggests in his book Future Days; âItâs only possible retrospectively to assess the colossal size of Radio-Activity as a milestone in electronic music, one that marks a precise and signal midpoint between Stockhausen and Depeche Mode.â\n\nEuropean canon\n\nKraftwerk werenât the masters of the dancefloor just yet. Though respected outside Germany, the group still met with some confusion, even amusement, at home.\n\nFortunately, someone was about to change all that â and that was David Bowie. Bowie had weaved his way skilfully through the styles and trends of the 1970s, but by 1976 he was desperate to escape a spiral of drugs and paranoia (in the States, he was in the habit of stashing his urine in a fridge to keep it out of reach of witches).\n\nBowie and his equally strung-out friend Iggy Pop moved to Berlin, where Bowie threw himself into German music.\n\nBowieâs interest in Cluster, Neu! and Kraftwerk did each side several favours: it recast him as an avatar of aheadness, and his seal of approval helped legitimised these acts, whether they wanted it or not.Â\n\nThere had been discussions about a potential Bowie album with Kraftwerk and he even asked them to support him on tour (perhaps these projectsâ failures are a blessing, as the band might have been grafted with a permanent Bowie association).\n\nKraftwerk were also fond of Iggy, having long been fans of the Stooges (it perhaps seems odd that the druggy, chaotic, freeform racket of the Stooges found fans in HÃ¼tter and Schneider).\n\nRead more: Karl Bartos interview\n\nBowie, Iggy, HÃ¼tter and Schneider enjoyed a mutual friendship largely based upon shopping for white asparagus and disco dancing, and Kraftwerk name-checked the pair on the title track of their new album, Trans-Europe Express â âWeâre running into DÃ¼sseldorf city/ And meet Iggy Pop and David Bowieâ.\n\nThe first few minutes of the title track of Station To Station pays clear homage to Trans-Europe Express, and the âBerlin trilogyâ is one of Bowieâs all-time career highlights.\n\nWith rock star patronage, Trans-Europe Express marked a great leap forward for Kraftwerk, and it also sat comfortably alongside 1977âs key cultural developments.\n\nThe punks liked Bowie and, by extension, liked Kraftwerk; and then there was the onset of disco, which had been tootling along nicely for a couple of years but went stratospheric in 1977 with Donna Summerâs I Feel Love, a piece of music that still manages to sound like the future.\n\nTogether, Giorgio Moroder and Kraftwerk, in effect, laid out the blueprint for pop as we would come to know it.Â\n\nOstensibly built around a train journey, Trans-Europe Express harked back to a gentler idea of the future, and also a less dependent influence, moving towards Europe as a whole.\n\nThe album dealt with the subjects of reality and artifice; The Hall Of Mirrors reflected the experiences Kraftwerk had as pop stars with Autobahn, while the conception of Showroom Dummies stemmed from an uncomplimentary live review.Â\n\nAs HÃ¼tter explained, âShowroom Dummies, that is the transition from human to dummy to robots, from posing and static to animation and motorising. We were on our way to robotisationâ¦ is that a word?\n\n“We are mainly talking about ourselves in that song, we felt photographed to death. Thatâs why we brought in the dummies, and later robots, because they have more patience with photographers.âÂ\n\nNext yearâs models\n\n1978âs The Man-Machine saw the quartet refining their sound into a less minimal, non-organic state with â whether by chance or design â a noticeably increased element of danceability. The Man-Machine was significant in inspiring the oncoming influx of chart futurists such as Gary Numan, OMD and The Human League.\n\nThe cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist El Lissitzky and the Suprematism movement.\n\nThere was a slight creeping sense of democracy slipping in, with Bartos almost being co-credited for the first time on key tracks such as The Robots and The Model.\n\nAt this point there was a sense that Kraftwerk were now in an awkward position of playing catch-up after all the recent advances and developments in electronic music that had been kicked off by I Feel Love.\n\nStill, what The Man-Machine may have lacked in foresight â despite its themes of science fiction and artificial intelligence â it made up by being the most human-sounding Kraftwerk album yet.\n\nIn some ways, the belated success of The Model redressed to a degree the imbalance of synth-popâs big wave.\n\nAt one point in early 1982, both The Human Leagueâs Being Boiled (which was buoyed by the nationâs new hunger for any League releases post-Dare) and Kraftwerkâs The Model would appear in the UK Top 10, with The Model topping the chart, as if to finally crown those two key records â I Feel Love and Trans-Europe Express â that had set so much in motion five years previously.\n\nBy the time Computer World arrived in 1981, Kraftwerk were back to being seen as very much of the moment.\n\nThe keenest students of the band â Soft Cell, Japan, Human League, OMD â had taken their sound and were flooding the charts with Musician Union-upsetting electronics and the strange and important sound of the synthesizer.\n\nComputer World saw Kraftwerk take control of futurism and ideas that would soon be part of our very existence. From what once had seemed exotic and distant and enchanting, the computer had taken centre stage in human life.\n\nKraftwerk pre-empted online dating (Computer Love), an increasing dependence on numerals (Pocket Calculator, Numbers) and more.\n\nKraftwerk were seen as being pioneers of the music-making abilities of a humble calculator, playing them live mid-concert and dancing as if someone had just downloaded the moves into them, ironically, as HÃ¼tter claims: âWe didnât even have computers.\n\nEven though the music was created by synthesisers and sequencers, it was analogue, pre-computer. We actually got our first home computers after the album was finishedâ¦ the first Ataris.â\n\nChanging gear\n\nBehind closed doors, discontent was rife within Kraftwerk. Indeed, Wolfgang FlÃ¼râs contributions to the album were not used, though his presence on the artwork suggested he was still a band member.\n\n1983 saw the release of the single Tour De France; originally recorded to be part of the next album, the song came out in the summer of 1983.\n\nFeaturing more complex sonic layers than Kraftwerk had before attempted, it was seen as something of a departure for the group after the two technological-heavy previous albums.\n\nHÃ¼tter had long been a fan of cycling and had avidly followed the annual race for many years, sometimes even riding alongside it; he was also in the habit of taking a bicycle with him on tour to slip out for a bit of exercise.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the singleâs release HÃ¼tter suffered a cycling accident on the Rhine Dam and was unable to work with the band for some time.\n\nThe single was recorded in two versions, one English language and one German, with extra lyrics written by Maxime Schmitt, a French label associate.\n\nTour De France acted as an aperitif for the upcoming album, which was beginning to take up too much time to complete, partly owing to HÃ¼tterâs accident.\n\nElectric CafÃ© finally arrived in 1986 although, befitting its troubled gestation, the album had gone through a handful of titles; the name would be changed once again in 2009 when it was reissued as Techno Pop, which had been the working title from the start.\n\nThe record was produced by French-born, New York-dwelling DJ FranÃ§ois Kevorkian. To compound difficulties further, and probably fed up of not featuring on another album, Wolfgang FlÃ¼r finally unplugged his equipment and left Kraftwerk in 1987.\n\nMix and remixÂ\n\nBy the early 1990s, Kraftwerkâs work would start to play more of a part in dance music, with the group being feted by the likes of Orbital, sampled by Chemical Brothers and even touring with U2.\n\nSoon they were firmly back in vogue, playing dance music festivals and issuing a sort-of reswizzled âBest Ofâ with 1991âs The Mix, where, not for the first time, they rebooted and rerecorded selected âhitsâ with varying degrees of success.\n\nAlso ahead of the 1990s, Wolfgang FlÃ¼r was replaced in the live context by Kling Klang studio hand Fritz Hilpert, who had also engineered The Mix.\n\nKarl Bartos also departed in the early part of the decade, and so â keen to keep Kraftwerk looking like a quartet â HÃ¼tter and Schneider recruited Fernando Abrantes.\n\nAt the end of the decade came another career waymark, the song Expo 2000, based around an a capella jingle and recorded for the Hannover Expo 2000 worldâs fair in Germany.\n\nA single was issued in December 1999 which expanded the jingle into a fully-fledged piece of music. Expo 2000 was later reworked to remove all Expo references and titled Planet Of Visions.\n\nKraftwerkâs last album of sort-of new material came in 2003 with Tour De France Soundtracks, released in honour of the bike raceâs centenary celebrations.\n\nAlongside a series of remodels of the famous title track came new tracks in the form of Vitamin, Aero Dynamik and Elektro Kardiogramm, co-written with Hilpert. The ensuing tour was celebrated with the groupâs first live album, 2005âs Minimum-Maximum, compiled from shows from their 2004 tour.\n\nDuring their world tour of 2008, which included a second triumphant appearance at Coachella, Schneider was absent from the line-up, with HÃ¼tter claiming he was working on other projects, and this was confirmed that November when Kraftwerk officially announced his departure from the group.\n\nThroughout the next decade saw the touring quartet consisted of Ralf HÃ¼tter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008.\n\nSince then HÃ¼tter and his hired hands have continued to refine themselves into perfection.\n\nWith various tours, the reissues and an increasing level of absorption into the art world, Kraftwerkâs story is one that has transcends the bandâs humdrum DÃ¼sseldorf beginnings.\n\nItâs no overstatement to say that Kraftwerk initiated a revolutionary moment that has echoed through music ever since.\n\nNow, more than half a century after the band was formed, itâs only right that they are saluted and celebrated as much as the other key signifiers of 21st century music.Â\n\nWant more from Classic Pop magazine?
