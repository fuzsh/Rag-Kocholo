        "text": "FRENCH POP LYRICS\n\nThe 2020 Tour de France is due to start at the end of this month in Nice. Kraftwerk released this single about the race in 1983 and it was a hit in the UK. 20 years later they reworked it on their album “Tour de France Soundtracks”. The melody seems to be ‘borrowed’ from the opening of Paul Hindemith’s “Sonata for Flute and Piano” (1936).\n\nWith this song Kraftwerk become only the second act (after France Gall) to complete a ‘hat-trick’ of songs in Spanish, French and German on this blog.\n\nRIP Florian Schneider, one of the founding members of Kraftwerk, who died earlier this year."
