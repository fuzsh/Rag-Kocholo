        "text": "Review: Wednesday's State Theatre concert was largely a repeat of a 2015 show, but still unlike anything else.\n\nBy Chris Riemenschneider\n\nJune 2, 2022 at 1:22PM\n\nKraftwerk’s members again stood behind podiums through the duration of Wednesday’s concert. except during “We Are the Robots.” (Charlotte Freitag/Star Tribune)\n\nThe co-founder of the group also sang here and there. Hütter donned a robotic vocal effect on his microphone early in the show during \"Computer World,\" and later he came across like an emotionless Bryan Ferry later in \"Neon Lights\" and \"Autobahn,\" the latter accompanied by backdrop video of an old Volkswagen Bug rolling down the road in lo-fi '80s computer graphics.\n\nEven though Wednesday's show featured nearly all the same songs and visual effects as the prior Northrop gig — including identical opening and closing tunes, \"Numbers\" and \"Musique Non Stop\" — it was unique and creative enough in the first place to feel far from routine.\n\nThe concert was also unusually vibrant on the sonic front. Repetitively grooving classics like \"The Model\" and \"Tour de France\" and a crescendoing new piece called \"Airwaves / Tango\" would have generated a sea of dancing if not for the theater seats and the audience staring hypnotically at all the 3D effects. Alas, though, only the robots danced at this one.\n\nOld-school green-screen text rolled behind the band members during “Computer World” at the State Theatre. (Chris Riemenschneider/Star Tribune)\n\nChris Riemenschneider\n\nColumnist/Reporter\n\nChris Riemenschneider has been covering the Twin Cities music scene since 2001, long enough for Prince to shout him out during \"Play That Funky Music (White Boy).\" The St. Paul native authored the book \"First Avenue: Minnesota's Mainroom\" and previously worked as a music critic at the Austin American-Statesman in Texas.\n\nSee More"
