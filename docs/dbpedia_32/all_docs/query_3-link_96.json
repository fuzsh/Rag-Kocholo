        "text": "It's near impossible to measure the musical impact and importance of Kraftwerk, so far-reaching and enduring is their influence in the foundations of electronic music.\n\nEmerging in the 1970s, the German group's metronomic, future-facing, synth-driven sound was the pioneering blueprint for genres spanning such as synthpop, new wave and industrial music.\n\nThey also shaped the early sound of hip hop, techno, trance and house, heavily sampled and serving as the source of huge hits for everyone from Coldplay to Jay-Z and Afrika Bambaataa, to name a very small sample.\n\nThey're regularly hailed as The Beatles of electronic music, there's a wealth of treasure to unpack from Kraftwerk's sound, story and success as cutting-edge innovators. But it can be an intimidating legacy for anyone looking to access their work for the first time.\n\nThat's where we come in.\n\nFrom key background info to essential songs with commentary from Beck, Elton John, Brian Eno, Paul Mac, and more - consider this your Kraftwerk For Dummies.\n\nNicely timed too, with news that Kraftwerk are bringing their audio-visual spectacle to Australia on tour this December, including appearing at Victoria's beloved Meredith Music Festival this December.\n\nWho:\n\nFlorian Schneider and Ralf Hütter co-founded Kraftwerk (which translates to 'Power Plant') in 1970\n\nWolfgang Flür joined in 1974, followed by Karl Bartos in 1975, resulting in the 'classic' Kraftwerk line-up\n\nWhen:\n\nThe original duo of Schneider and Hütter released three albums (largely overlooked by the duo themselves) that marked a transition from experimental krautrock to embracing electronic instrumentation: Kraftwerk (1970), Kraftwerk 2 (1972) and Ralf & Florian (1973).\n\nKraftwerk's legacy truly begins with 1974 album Autobahn. Inspired by driving their native German highways, it's a Top 10 hit in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, parts of Europe and here in Australia.\n\n1975's Radio-Activity is the first release and international touring for the 'classic' line-up of the band.\n\nTheir next string of records — Trans-Europe Express (1977), The Man-Machine (1978) and Computer World (1981) – are considered classics, cementing the group's influential sound and visual aesthetic.\n\nTheir next release was 1986's Electric Café followed by another a five-year break that led to 1991's The Mix, which featured re-arranged versions of music from earlier albums.\n\nTour de France Soundtracks (2003) was Kraftwerk's first album in 17 years and leaned into their passion for cycling – recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race.\n\nIn April 2020, Florian Schneider died age 73 after a long battle with cancer.\n\n- In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, with all four 'classic' members inducted as part of the Early Influences category.\n\nAs of 2023, Kraftwerk continues to tour and perform, with co-founder Hütter leading a line-up comprising of Henning Schmitz, Falk Grieffenhagen, and Georg Bongartz.\n\nWhere:\n\nBorn and based in West Germany, Hütter and Schneider first met in the late 1960s while studying classical music.\n\nIn 1970, they founded their own custom-built Kling Klang studio in Düsseldorf, where nearly all of Kraftwerk's music was recorded.\n\nKraftwerk visited Australia only a handful of times: first touring in 1981, then as part of the 2003 Big Day Out, for 2008's Global Gathering festival, and most recently for a string of career-spanning performances for Sydney's VIVID Live in 2013.\n\nWhat:\n\nNow you've got the basics, here's the six essential Kraftwerk tracks to set you on the path into a prolific catalogue.\n\n'Autobahn' (1974)\n\nThe song that made Kraftwerk an international sensation. The title track is actually a 22-min electro-pastoral composition that takes up half of the original album's vinyl pressing but it was a single edit that became a hit in Australia, the UK, US, and nine other countries.\n\n\"It's just tremendous!\" the one and only Elton John said in 1975. \"Barriers are gradually being broken down – it doesn't have to be American or British to be good now, which is very good.\"\n\nAnother huge supporter was David Bowie, who'd play their music to audiences on tour and talk them up as one of his favourite groups in interviews before becoming close friends with the group.\n\nHe even credited Kraftwerk with inspiring his renewed interest in Europe and electronic music, prompting his move to Berlin and recording his groundbreaking trilogy ('77's \"Heroes\" and Low, '79's odger) with Brian Eno – another noted Kraftwerk fan ever since 1973 LP Ralf & Florian.\n\n\"That's actually one of my favourite albums and certainly my favourite Kraftwerk album,\" Eno once told ABC.\n\n\"They seem to proceed from a different starting point than most English music. They're not based in rhythm'n'blues, what they do I necessarily different from what we do.\"\n\n'Radio-Activity' (1975)\n\n\"I find the melancholy of Kraftwerk very, very moving,\" Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos said while he was Double J Artist In Residence.\n\n\"You know people sometimes dismiss them as being cold but I see there being so much warmth behind those machines.\"\n\nHe believes the title track from the group's 1975 concept album organised around the ides of nuclear power and radio communication best expresses the men in the machine.\n\nAnother admirer of the \"near dystopian\" song is pre-eminent Australian electronic producer Paul Mac. \"Is it a celebration of radioactivity? Is it a comment on nuclear fears? I just love how they embrace the idea and just present this almost future-retro worldview.\"\n\nThe original 'techno pop' number remains powerfully haunting but the group would re-tool the song for 1991's The Mix into an anti-nuclear anthem, with references to nuclear disasters like Chernobyl and the protest refrain of 'Stop radioactivity'.\n\n'Trans-Europe Express' (1977)\n\nPerhaps Kraftwerk's single most influential work, extending the ideology of 'Autobahn' into a hypnotic intercontinental journey by train that synthesises pop, austere European traditions and futurism into a timeless slice of electronica.\n\nIt's also cool as fuck, with knowing lyrical nods such as: 'From station to station, back to Düsseldorf city/ Meet Iggy Pop and David Bowie'.\n\nAs well as laying the track for early hip-hop, with Afrika Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force flipping the track's synths (and beats from Kraftwerk's 'Numbers') into the formative mega-hit 'Planet Rock', the chugging rhythms, robotic voices and icy, minimalist keys laid the groundwork for everything from post-punk icons Joy Division to electronic legends Daft Punk, and pretty much invented '80s pop greats like Depeche Mode, Duran Duran and The Human League.\n\n'The Model' (1978)\n\nThe most recognisable cut from seventh album The-Man Machine, 'The Model' (or 'Das Model' in its original German) is one of the group's most immediate offerings. It's a twinkling, infectious pop ditty that became a surprise hit, topping the UK charts in 1981 when it was re-released to coincide with the group's next album, Computer World.\n\nIt's also got the distinction of being one of the most covered (rather than sampled) Kraftwerk numbers, versions recorded by several artists, including a scuzzy '80s punk makeover by Big Black and a grinding industrial metal version from Rammstein.\n\nLike so much of Kraftwerk's output, the song's simple presentation belies deeper themes that were conceptually well ahead of their time. In this case, an examination on celebrity worship and disconnection.\n\n\"It's about the context of an object, paying money: for beauty we will pay,\" Hütter told Uncut in 2009.\n\n\"I think the cynicism is obvious, don't you? And then we'd get asked by everyone in clubs we went: is it me? Who is this? But it's not based on anybody.\"\n\n'Computer Love' (1981)\n\nWhat could seem strangely outdated – Hütter yearning for a 'data date' in the heart of a computer – has instead become a moving, melancholy meditation on the relationship between romance and technology.\n\nIt's a striking example of what Kate Crawford from Aussie '90s electro duo B(if)tek calls Kraftwerk's \"extraordinary predictive power.\"\n\n\"If you think about when this was written, they were talking about computer dating and things that are right now just part of everyday life but back then was the stuff of fantasy.\n\n\"For me, the way that I think about music itself as a place where you can explore different ideas about the social and the world, that's certainly this track 'Computer Love'.\"\n\nSeminal neo-classical composer Max Richter agrees.\n\n\"This is classic Kraftwerk, which feels like a very simple little poppy tune but actually it's super-subversive,\" he told Double J.\n\n\"If you listen to the lyrics, it's a critique of surveillance capitalism. It's very prescient and there they are in 1980 talking about this extraordinary idea, which of course we around us all the time now.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Coldplay interpolated the song's signature keyboard riff for 'Talk', from their 2005 album X&Y, which taps into the same sense of yearning but from an arena-rock angle.\n\n'Tour De France' (1983/2003)\n\nSpend any time reading into Kraftwerk, and you'll learn that Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter were obsessive cyclists, regularly biking between tour stops and taking part in long-distance races.\n\n'Tour De France' is the group's electropop homage to their beloved hobby and a spiritual sequel to 'Trans-Europe Express' and 'Autboahn' that plays out on two wheels.\n\nEnjoyable in either its original 1983 version or the cleaner re-make for 2003 album Tour De France Soundtracks, it captures the euphoric high of the rider, filled with the sampled sounds of whirring bicycle chains and heavy breathing as the sonic scenery gently glides by.\n\nWhy:\n\nIf you've made it this far, Kraftwerk's legacy should be more obvious than when you began this beginner's guide. But to re-iterate:\n\n\"It'd be difficult to overestimate the impact that Kraftwerk have had one way or another over the past decade,\" says Green Gartside of British indie band Scritti Politti. \"They've influenced what almost everybody has done, either directly or indirectly.\n\n\"[They were] an antidote to the kind of sloppy excesses of post-punk Britain. I became interested in technology through Kraftwerk, and the idea that drum machines could make you groove.\"\n\nPaul Mac calls them \"game-changers\" that changed his concept of what \"a good musician\" could be.\n\n\"I started with Computer World. It was mind-boggling: the sound world, the concept… It was all -encompassing; the artwork, their live show was all playing on this idea of man as machine to the nth degree.\"\n\nBut aside form their radical nature, he also admires their \"really good sense of humour.\"\n\n\"In their po-faced imagery and them always on a staircase looking stern or really German. Sometimes it was 'are they serious? Or are they just pushing this for laughs?'\"\n\nIt was Kraftwerk's approach to technology – a mix of mastery and playful curiosity – that made it seem like they were not only gesturing to music's possibilities but predicting and shaping them.\n\nA quality that made this German group seem otherworldly to the traditional Western music world.\n\n\"The first time I ever heard Kraftwerk,\" remembers B(if)tek's Kate Crawford, \"[was] around five years old. All I remember is hearing music that I thought was made by aliens, and my mother said I would not stop dancing to this music.\n\n\"In every way, I think Kraftwerk gave me a sense that music could be something very different to the traditional rock sound. It could be infinite, there was a universe of sounds you could create yourself.\n\n\"You could even create your own instruments, which is something Kraftwerk was really ahead of their time in doing.\""
