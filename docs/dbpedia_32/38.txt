I'm not well versed in the Tour de France but I've been enjoying Kraftwerk's song of the same name.

The song was originally released as a single in 1983 and features some hub noises and also some (I think) pump noises as well. 1983 version.

The group re-recorded the song in 2003 and made a full album called Tour de France. 2003 version.

It's easy to get them confused, they used the same album artwork for both releases!

It's interesting to hear how the sounds of the hubs and pumps have changed between the recordings. I much prefer the '83 version, for the hubs and the synths. Both sound warmer.

Figured others might enjoy.

Back in 2015 Kraftwerk played a gig at the TdF Grand Depart in Utrecht.

There's an interview in Rolling Stone with Ralf Hütter where he talks about their long association with cycling: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kraftwerk-on-cycling-3d-spiritual-connection-to-detroit-56548/.

My favourite Kraftwerk album, though, is not Tour de France Soundtracks, but Trans-Europe Express.

Gotta say that Trans Europe Express is my favorite as well. I have tickets to see their 3D show here in July. The last one was cancelled due to COVID so hopefully this goes on as planned.

I need to track down the original Tour de France and check it out. I only have the 2003 version.

The Man Machine is my favorite. But I think my favorite performance is an early show with the two members of Neu! It was quite a different band:

So different that the remaining members pretend it doesn't exist.
