        "text": "Naomi on Naomi on Naomi\n\nDoppelganger – Naomi Klein (Allen Lane)\n\n‘We are not, and never were, self-made. We are made, and unmade, by one another.’\n\nFor some time, people have confused the anti-capitalist, climate activist Naomi Klein with the (former?) feminist and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf. This wasn’t a huge issue for Klein until it was. Until Wolf’s brand of conspiracy became hurtful and harmful and Klein’s reputation was at stake. Until Klein saw herself disappearing – a sentiment most of us can appreciate – during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when life was largely lived online and conspiracies rocketed.\n\nKlein explores the reasons she sees for Wolf’s transition to ‘diagonalist politics’ through which Wolf has aligned herself with people such as Steve Bannon, far-right commentator and Donald Trump’s former strategist. This becomes a doorway into wider issues: how the novelty and uncertainty of a worldwide pandemic allowed conspiracy theorists to exploit people’s fears; how everyone with an online profile has created their own doppelganger from whom Big Tech is harvesting data; the wellness industry and how it became wrapped up in the far-right, and autism as the trial-run for the anti-vaxxers.\n\nThroughout these deep dives, Klein returns repeatedly to the idea of the doppelganger in literature and film. From Hans Christian Anderson and Charlie Chaplin to Carmen Maria Machado and Jordan Peele, landing firmly, although somewhat to her chagrin, on Philip Roth, Klein explores the portrayal of doubles, discussing their roles to illuminate our own doppelgangers and how we might handle them.\n\nWhile all of this sounds like heavy going, there is humour integrated. As a fellow Naomi, I am grateful to Klein for including the correct pronunciation of our name:\n\nIn Montreal’s Jewish community, where I grew up, almost everyone pronounced it “Nye-oh-me,” with a flat “eye” on the first syllable that sounded whiny and dreary to my ears. No matter how many times I introduced myself as “Nay-oh-me,” it came back with the “Nyeeee-oh-me” drone.\n\n“You gave me a name with a built-in whine,” I whined to my mother when I was in tenth grade.\n\nShe also discusses being confused for Naomi Campbell on multiple occasions, something that has also happened to me despite being neither a Londoner nor a supermodel. Klein initially attributed this to the name being ‘just uncommon enough that the first Naomi a person became aware of tended to imprint herself in their mind as a kind of universal Naomi’. A theory which falls flat to me as I confess to confusing Klein and Wolf myself, despite Campbell being the first and, for a long time, the only other Naomi whose existence I was aware of.\n\nThroughout the book, Klein questions herself, ‘other Naomi’ – as she refers to the version of Wolf she has to live with – having led her to this state. The core of this becomes an inquiry into whether or not changing the discourse changes the world. Particularly in a society where ‘monstrous clowns’ such as Trump and Boris Johnson have trivialised issues and even Greta Thunberg, who once gave rousing speeches, now replies ‘Blah blah blah’ to the deals and treaties announced by leaders who then take little to no action.\n\nWhat then is the point of reading this book? Whoever our doppelgangers, whether self-created or imposed upon us, Klein’s response is to tell us to return from the mirror world, stop building fortresses we think will keep us safe by keeping others out, and start joining collective action, discussing our differences and pushing for the changes that just might save us and the planet we live on. The point of the book is a call to arms. We can all spend hours online masquerading as our doppelgangers, reading and debating, but what action are we going to take in the physical world?\n\nThe copy of Doppelganger I read was my own purchase.\n\nI’m, erm, late to posting here this year. This is partly because the start of the year in the UK was rough; lockdown in winter is no fun whatsoever. It’s also partly because I’ve been working on a new project, a podcast called Late To It, with my friend and co-host Kirsty Doole.\n\nLate To It is about reading books at the right time. The idea that you are ‘late’ to a book, film, TV series, exhibition, article and so on has become pervasive on social media in the last few years. We wanted to reclaim this idea and make it positive. Sometimes you read a book that’s been around for years at a time that’s perfect for you, when it means more than it ever would if you’d read it on the week it was published. We wanted to capture that and to highlight books that are out in paperback that might not have had the attention they deserved when they were first released. We also wanted a reason to read those books that have been sitting on our own shelves for a while that we’ve been neglected for the shiny and new ones that can sometime feel as though they’re shouting for our attention.\n\nThe first episode features two debut novels: Gwendoline Riley’s Cold Water, which is set in Manchester, a city I love and am strongly connected to, and Kirsten Innes’ Fishnet, which is set in an unnamed city that might be Glasgow, which is close to where Kirsty grew up.\n\nWe do also mention more recent books that we’ve been reading and enjoying. In this episode they are:\n\nlittle scratch by Rebecca Watson\n\nMrs Death Misses Death by Salena Godden\n\nSanatorium by Abi Palmer\n\nYou can view our podcast landing page, and listen directly, here. Or listen on Spotify here. We will also be available on Apple, we’re just waiting for them to approve the listing. We hope you enjoy it and discover some new/old books.\n\nAt the end of 2019, I challenged myself to read 100 books from my own shelves. What I meant by from my own shelves were the books that had been sitting there some time, often for years. I was fed up of not getting to books that I knew I wanted to read because there was always something shiny and new in front of me. The pandemic helped, of course; losing most of your work and being forced to stay at home will do that. I finished the 100 in early December. Here are the ones I really really loved.\n\nThe Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake – Aimee Bender (Windmill)\n\nI thought this would be twee, I was so wrong. The story of a girl who realises she can taste people’s emotions; the story of her brother who begins to disappear. It’s about trauma and depression and it’s perfect.\n\nThe Western Wind – Samantha Harvey (Jonathan Cape)\n\nA Brexit allegory disguised as a Medieval whodunnit. Utterly compelling.\n\nFleishman Is in Trouble – Taffy Brodesser-Akner (Wildfire)\n\nA soon-to-be-ex-wife and mother disappears. A terrible soon-to-be-ex-husband who thinks he’s great has his story narrated by his ‘crazy’ friend. A piercing look at heterosexual marriage and a send-up of the Great American Novel. Longer review here.\n\nThings we lost in the fire – Mariana Enriquez (translated by Megan McDowell) (Granta)\n\nDark, dark, dark stories. So haunting, so brilliant.\n\nExquisite Cadavers – Meena Kandasamy (Atlantic)\n\nA Oulipo style novella showing how fiction can be created from life, but it isn’t the same thing. Longer review here.\n\nOngoingness: The End of a Diary – Sarah Manguso (Graywolf Press)\n\nManguso wrote a daily diary until she had her first child. This is full of ideas of letting go which are so brilliant I copied many of them on to Post-Its and stuck them above my desk. It’s published by Picador in the UK.\n\nwe are never meeting in real life – Samantha Irby (Faber)\n\nIrby is my discovery of the year. Her essays are laugh-out-loud funny and entertaining but they are also about her life as a working class, disabled Black woman with a traumatic childhood. Revolutionary.\n\nHeartburn – Nora Ephron (Virago)\n\nFunny; good on cooking and marriage. Devastating final chapter.\n\nFingersmith – Sarah Waters (Virago)\n\nClever crime novel about class, the art of theft and pornography. Superb structure. A masterpiece.\n\nThe Chronology of Water – Lidia Yuknavitch (Canongate)\n\nYuknavitch’s non-chronological memoir about the fifteen lives she has lived. It’s about dying (metaphorically), swimming (literally and metaphorically) and living (literally). It fizzes.\n\nBear – Marian Engel (Pandora)\n\nThe headline is this is a book about a woman who has sex with a bear. It’s really about female autonomy. It’s being republished in the UK in 2021 by Daunt Books.\n\nMagic for Beginners – Kelly Link (Harper Perennial)\n\nKelly Link is a genius. These stories are so rich in detail; she takes you from a situation that seems perfectly normal to a wild, subverted world that also seems perfectly normal. Incredible.\n\nParable of the Talents – Octavia E. Butler (Headline)\n\nThe novel that predicted a president who would aim to ‘Make America Great Again’. It’s as much the story of a mother / daughter relationship formed under significant trauma as it is the story of a country at war with itself. Longer review here.\n\nCopies of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake, Fleishman is in Trouble, Exquisite Cadavers, we are never meeting in real life, The Chronology of Water and Parable of the Talents were courtesy of the publishers as listed. All others are my own copies.\n\nI’ve read more books this year than I’ve ever read in a year before. It’s been a very strange time, but these are the books published this year that have resonated with me.\n\nThis Mournable Body – Tsitsi Dangarembga (Faber)\n\nTambudzai’s life is not going how she expected. In her 30s, living in a hostel, unemployed, in a country that’s hostile, there are multiple structural barriers preventing her progress. An examination of a woman and a country. A masterpiece. Longer review here.\n\nLove After Love – Ingrid Persaud (Faber)\n\nA woman widowed from her abusive husband; her young son, and a gay man hiding his sexuality. Their bond asks the question what really makes a family? Betty, Solo and Mr Chetan have lived in my head since I read this in the first half of the year. Gorgeous. Longer review here.\n\nSo We Can Glow – Leesa Cross-Smith (Grand Central)\n\nCross-Smith’s latest short story collection celebrates women and girls. Their triumphs, their tribulations, their crushes, their loves, the way they support each other to rebuild themselves and their lives. The language and the characters fizz. Longer review here.\n\nThe Meaning of Mariah Carey – Mariah Carey with Michaela Angela Davis (Macmillan)\n\nIt shouldn’t really be a surprise that Carey’s memoir isn’t your average celebrity memoir. Open, honest and reflective, Carey looks at her traumatic childhood, her marriage to Tommy Mottola and her career. A fascinating insight into who she is and how she became one of the most successful singers in the world.\n\nThe Bass Rock – Evie Wyld (Jonathan Cape)\n\nThe story of three women, in three different time periods, lived in the shadow of the Bass Rock. They’re linked by what one of Wyld’s minor characters – the brilliant Maggie – describes as a serial killer: toxic masculinity. Maggie’s idea of a map showing places where women have been killed by men has haunted me all year, as has the final page of the novel. Longer review here.\n\nHamnet – Maggie O’Farrell (Tinder Press)\n\nNamed for Shakespeare’s son who died – probably of plague – and the play that was probably written about Shakespeare’s grief: Hamlet. Really though, this is the story of Agnes (Anne), Shakespeare’s wife. Beautiful and vividly told. O’Farrell’s well-deserved acclaim was long overdue. Longer review here.\n\nBreasts and Eggs – Mieko Kawakami (translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd) (Picador)\n\nA novel in two-parts exploring Natsuko’s sister’s desire for breast implants and then Natsuko’s questions around whether or not she wants a child. An examination of the expectations placed on women from a working class Japanese perspective with a bonus send-up of the literary industry. Longer review here.\n\nIn the Dream House – Carmen Maria Machado (Serpent’s Tail)\n\nA ground-breaking memoir of an emotionally abusive, same-gender relationship. It questions notions of the canon through a range of devices and genres while delivering a devastating portrait of domestic abuse. Longer review here.\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem – Natalie Diaz (Faber)\n\nAn investigation of the body as a site of trauma and of desire. Diaz connects the body to the land, the water (particularly rivers) and the air, showing how violation of the elements by white Americans has led to irreparable damage. This is also a celebration of queer love and language that elevates and transcends. Longer review here.\n\nBad Love – Maame Blue (Jacaranda Books)\n\n19yo Ekuah has an on / off affair with up-and-coming musician Dee. Later she meets English teacher and spoken word night organiser Jay Stanley. The two men exert different pulls on her life, but Ekuah has to work out how she wants to live. I was rooting for her all the way. Longer review here.\n\nWriters & Lovers – Lily King (Picador)\n\nCasey’s in her 30s. Single, a waitress trying to write a novel, living in her brother’s friend’s shed, she meets two men: Silas is a teacher and a writer, but unreliable; Oscar is slightly older, an established writer, widowed with two young boys. Casey has to decide whether to accept or reject a conventional life. I wrote about her choices for the Pan Macmillan blog.\n\nNudibranch – Irenosen Okojie (Dialogue Books)\n\nOkojie is the queen of stories that take you to unexpected places. Her latest collection is a wild ride of time-travelling silent monks; some unexpected zombies; a heart-eating goddess; mechanical boys, and an albino man who brings fountains to a small town in Mozambique. The incredible ‘Grace Jones’, about an impersonator and her past, deservedly won the 2020 AKO Cane Prize. Slightly longer review here.\n\nThanks to the publishers (as listed) for This Mournable Body, The Bass Rock, Hamnet, Breasts and Eggs, and Writers & Lovers. All other books are my own purchases.\n\nThings have been slightly derailed by my despair at the situation in the UK and being exhausted at the end of term. I also wanted everything I recommended to be fairly recent publications and I over-estimated how much reading I could do. But I’m back on track so I’m going to do two round-ups, one today and one on Thursday (Christmas Eve).\n\nSo We Can Glow – Leesa Cross-Smith (Grand Central Publishing)\n\nThe ‘We’ in the title of Lessa Cross-Smith’s latest short story collection is women and girls. Through a collective narration in the opening story ‘We, Moons’ the hopes, dreams and fears of women and girls are laid out:\n\nWe’re not depressed all the time, some of us aren’t even depressed sometimes. We’re okay, our hearts, dusted with pink. When we cry in our bathrooms together it’s about men or our mothers or our fathers or our bodies. […] We love men. We are ashamed of this attraction. We, the ones who aren’t lesbians or asexual; we fantasise about lesbian communes or asexual communes.\n\nWhat follows are 41 stories in which women and girls have crushes, fall in love, have affairs, have relationships with good men and terrible men, form friendships which last a lifetime, live, laugh, cry.\n\nOne of the reasons I love Cross-Smith’s work is that we share a lot of cultural references. This exchange from ‘Teenage Dream Time Machine’ is a perfect example:\n\nDave and I were listening to\n\nDEF LEPPARD.\n\nPOUR SOME SUGAR ON\n\nME?!\n\nOf course! LOL.\n\nI love it. Did you ever dye\n\nyour hair?\n\nBright pink once and my mom\n\nalmost killed me. I used to\n\nspray Sun In in my hair when I\n\nlaid out but it didn’t do much. It\n\nsmelled good though. I wanted\n\nto be Drew Barrymore. I wanted\n\nto be Courtney Love for a\n\nminute too.\n\nSame. This is so funny…all\n\nthe women our age…we\n\nwere practically living the\n\nsame life! We’re all\n\nconnected…like magic.\n\nI also love that she takes crushes, especially on pop stars / actors / sportsmen seriously and the lives and thoughts of teenage girls. That she writes like a dream, ending so many of these stories on the most perfect lines, only elevates the stories of women and girls further. As it should be.\n\nMy Darling from the Lions – Rachel Long (Picador)\n\nRachel Long’s excellent debut collection considers love in all its forms: romantic, familial, friendship, discovering how to love yourself. A series of poems called ‘Open’ punctuate the first section:\n\nThis morning he told me\n\nI sleep with my mouth open\n\nand my hands in my hair.\n\nI say, What, like screaming?\n\nHe says, No, like abandon.\n\nBut it’s the love for her mother that really shines through:\n\nOrb\n\nMum combs her auburn ’fro up high.\n\nSo high it’s an orb.\n\nEveryone wants to – but cannot – touch it.\n\nThemes of race, class and misogyny underpin the collection and it’s often these undertones that deliver the vivid images and sucker punch final lines that resonate long after reading.\n\nEndless Fortune – Ify Adenuga (Own It! / Boy Better Know)\n\nIfy Adenuga is the mother of four children: Joseph Junior aka Skepta; Jamie aka Jme; Julie, who was the voice of Apple’s music station Beats 1 when it launched, and Jason, music producer and graphic designer. They’re the reason I picked up Endless Fortune, but Ify Adenuga’s own story turns out to be more interesting than her children’s.\n\nThe book begins when Adenuga is 10, living in Lagos with her family. The Bifran War begins and Adenuga’s family, who are Igbo, flee the city to their father’s village. Adenuga misses much about Lagos, not least attending school. When she is able to go to the nearest school the teacher suggests she skips a year (having missed three years of schooling) This creates tension with her father who thinks she should do things chronologically and come top of the class. Adenuga finds a way around this and passes the year with a high mark. This sets up two threads that weave throughout Adenuga’s story: the first is her passion for learning which takes her to a ‘good’ school, through a degree as a mature student, to setting up her own education centres and the second, her determination that no one will stand in her way.\n\nAdenuga’s memoir is one of a woman who took risks, stayed resilient through multiple setbacks, and created a life that allowed herself and her family to flourish. It’s a fascinating story.\n\nFuture Home of the Living God – Louise Erdrich (Corsair)\n\nWhen I tell you that my white name is Cedar Hawk Songmaker and that I am the adopted child of Minneapolis liberals, and that when I went looking for my Ojibwe parents and found that I was born Mary Potts I hid the knowledge, maybe you’ll understand. Or not. I’ll write this anyway, because ever since last week things have changed.\n\nCedar’s diary is written for the unborn baby she is carrying in a world where being pregnant is dangerous. As society breaks down, pregnant women are being captured and kept in hospitals.\n\nWhen Cedar discovers she is pregnant, she goes to meet her birth mother, withdraws all her savings and stockpiles things that might be useful – cigarettes, guns, ammunition. Protected by the baby’s father, she attempts to stay hidden, communicating with her birth family via her mother’s husband.\n\nIt’s a tense tale with some particularly evocative scenes; a period of time in hospital with an elective mute roommate is a really interesting section of the story, and there’s a graphic description of labour and birth that had me wincing.\n\nIf you’ve read Erdrich before you’ll know that in her novels the backstory is the story. In some ways, Future Home of the Living God, feels like a departure – things happen in the now as society changes and Cedar’s pregnancy progresses – in others, it feels like a typical Erdrich novel, specifically in the ending that makes the whole book feel as though it’s backstory. It left me wanting more of what happens next.\n\nCannibal – Safiya Sinclair (Picador)\n\nSafiya Sinclair’s debut collection takes her childhood home of Jamaica, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and her present home of America to explore and confront exile, otherness, race and womanhood. The poems here are deep and rich with language and ideas. Some feel very intense, ‘Pocomania’, for example, which begins:\n\nFather unbending father unbroken father\n\nwith the low-hanging belly, father I was cleaved from,\n\npressed into, cast and remolded, father I was forged\n\nin the fire of your self.\n\nOthers more spacious and provocative, such as ‘Elocution Lessons with Ms. Silverstone’, which opens with:\n\nIn high school boys were easy –\n\nthey saw none of you\n\nor all of you\n\nin one ravenous gaze,\n\nslurped hankering glances\n\nor walked right through\n\nyou in sterile absolution,\n\nhigh-fived and hissed about\n\nyour dick-sucking lips.\n\nBrewing names\n\nfor your body\n\nin the mastabatorium.\n\nIt’s an incredible collection and I’m excited to see where Sinclair’s career takes her.\n\nAll copies of these books are my own purchases.\n\nMy town was a collection of nests, a factory for manufacturing babies. I was a tool for the town’s good, in two senses.\n\nFirstly, I had to study hard to become a work tool.\n\nSecondly, I had to be a good girl, so that I could become a reproductive organ for the town.\n\nI would probably be a failure on both counts, I thought.\n\nEarthlings begins when Natsuki is eleven. She feels like an outsider in her immediate family, describing Piyyut the soft toy / magical alien from Planet Popinpobopia who has come to save the planet as her best friend. Natsuki is abused by a teacher at summer cram school but, when she tries to tell someone, no one believes her. However, when she is later discovered having sex with her cousin, she is punished.\n\nThe novel then leaps forward to adulthood when Natsuki is thirty-one and married. The marriage is one of convenience – neither Natsuki nor her husband are interested in a sexual relationship – but, other than comments about starting a family, it allows them to escape scrutiny. Neither of them wants to become work tools or reproductive tools for ‘the Factory’. During a trip to the countryside, where Natsuki sees her cousin again for the first time since they had sex, her husband begins to think about disengaging from society and living an alternative lifestyle. It’s a decision that will allow events from the past to resurface and the lives of those involved to change dramatically.\n\nEarthlings considers the effects of trauma and the damage done to people when society hides abusive behaviour and forces shame on the victims. It questions whether the society we’ve created is anything more than a production line. It is violent and shocking with one of the wildest endings I’ve ever read. Food for thought.\n\nEarthlings is published by Granta. Thanks to the publisher for the review copy."
