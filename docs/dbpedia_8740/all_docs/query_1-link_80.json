        "text": "The African Literary Evening was my idea even though I feel I cannot take all the credit for its success. The idea came about from the culmination of several conversations with people over a period of time. The African Literary Evening was an evening of spoken word, poetry recitations, book readings and networking. It was also an evening designed to bring together emerging and successful authors under the same platform to share ideas and interact. There are many events across London that bring men and women in print together, but not many that gather African authors.\n\nWe had two panels discuss certain topics and it was a coincidence that the panellists where all Nigerian and female. The topics included ‘making money from writing: is it possible to make a living as a writer?, the future of publishing in the UK: is it traditional publishing?, self-publishing and collaborative publishing or hybrid publishing?, beyond print, moving with the digital revolution: ebooks, podcasts, audio books and short films, genres and moving beyond expectations placed on African writing.\n\nOur panellists included Nuzo Onoh- a celebrated author of African horror novels, Abidemi Sanusi, Ireneson Okojie- columnist for the Observer and Independent, Abimbola Dare, Ola Nubi, Kiru Taye, Kemi Oguniyi, Amanda Epe, Tolu Popoola and Tundun Adeyemo. Our panellists are experienced writers who have earned their recognition in the world of writing. Sade Adeniran was the Common wealth Writers award winner for her book Imagine This in 2008 . Abidemi Sanusi was shortlisted for the same award for her book ‘Eyo’.\n\nAbidemi was able to discuss how she is able to work as a full time writer. She combines life as an author with her company ‘Ready Writer’. Kiru Taye is the number one writer of African romance in the UK. Kiru Taye writes full time and she makes a living from it. Kiru has written twelve books in four years. It is hard to keep up with her. Abimbola Dare, a Christian romance author, is another very influential and powerful writer, even with a young baby, she told the audience that she writes on her laptop whilst breast feeding her three month old baby- Life as a mummy author eh?\n\nSade Adeniran who runs Sade’s World of Podcasting now makes short films and documentaries. A true artiste, Sade is eying some of the converted awards in the industry. A lot of the panellists had things to contribute on whether it was possible to make a living in writing. Abimbola Dare was of the opinion that it could happen over time, but in the meantime, keep your day job. Adura Ojo, a poet, who was unable to join us at the event, also contributed that earning an income from writing is possible but the writer needs to be creative in creating streams of income. Streams of income available to authors include public speaking, workshops and seminars, events and commission writing.\n\nWe discussed the future of publishing in the United Kingdom, we considered whether it was best to go collaborative, self or hybrid and moving beyond the expectations placed on African writers in the UK. There was no common consensus as many in the audience were self-publishers who found fame through their own labour. Ireneson Okojie, a columnist for the Independent and Observer decried the fact that it was hard for publishing houses to take on African authors. Nuzo Onoh also commented on the fact that African writers are often categorised under multicultural and race headings in public libraries. She and Irene agreed that African writers had to think outside the box in terms of their content and publicity if they wanted to sell their books.\n\nMembers of the audience were not left out, someone wanted to ask how to combine writing with single motherhood to four children. Another wanted to find out if there were other authors who wrote only for African children in the UK? Another person wanted to introduce her new book: a Christian bible book for children. It was a solid event to all intents and purposes, many people even came from outside and the bar downstairs to see what was happening at the library where we were.\n\nHighlights of the evening included Theresa Lola, a spoken word artiste who thrilled the audience with her very passionate poem on the abducted Chibok girls and another poem about the essence of womanhood. Ola Nubi read an excerpt of her book ‘Love’s Persuasion. Sade Adeniran read a short story that reflected the drama associated with being dismissed from her job on the first day of working. Tundun Adeyemo read a poem from her collection ‘The Immigrant’. Tundun tried to portray the scene of a departure at the Murtala Muhammed airport about 13 years ago when she left Nigeria for England. Many people enjoyed the last line ‘I was going to England, not to see the Queen’. Tolulope Popoola read two of her flash fiction stories. One was from a collection titled ‘Fertile Imagination; and the other was ‘the Alibi’.\n\nThe evening ended with networking over warm and cold drinks, book sales and signings.\n\nAfter the event, we didn’t have to wait long to read and watch what people said about it. The Battabox spin to the event (video available on youtube) is humorous. Should Nigerian parents allow their children to be writers? Obi and Lola, Christopher Ejugbo and Adeola Akintoye all wrote different accounts of the evening. Adeola Akintoye called the event an evening extraordinaire. Christoger Ejugbo considered the fact whether or not Africans read in a thumbs up account of his Saturday evening with the event.\n\nAll in all, the African Literary Evening worked because of a successful collaboration with Accomplish Press. The question everyone is asking is will there be more events. The organisers are yet to decide.\n\nTundun Adeyemo\n\n.\n\nFeeling a little nostlagic this morning, I am going republishing another classic. I really really love this piece. I cannot tell you how much. I wrote this when I was pregnant with my little girl (Femi) and my sister had just had her son. Its nearly five years now and I wish I could still write like this. Originally titled Ire and I, I have changed that to ‘Mine Forever’.\n\nI can tell you one thing though, I am not this girl anymore. I am bona fide mum (warts and all):)\n\nIf this doesnt make you smile, nothing will.\n\nIre and I\n\nThis is for my nephew Ire Oyetade who is going to read this in a couple of years and smile (hopefully).\n\nThe Ancient Book of Jeremiah records ‘before I formed thee in the belly,I knew thee’.\n\nBefore Ire, I was a non- domesticated young woman. I had prided myself on the strength to focus on the things that matter in life: my job, my writings, the need to change my car and the urgency to get with the program and the need to get a mortgage. Babies and everything in that department were on number 10 on every life list made.\n\nAs a rule, I don’t do babies, children, diapers, milk, kitchen etc. I cook, but I wont describe myself as a gourmet goddess. I enjoy good food and I have every respect for those who have mastered the skills of doing magic with vegetables, beans, turkey or rice. My strength, I think, lies away from the domestics. I have friends who have the softer things in their lives planned. I am simply not that type. I take it you now know what I mean!\n\nTill I met Iretomide.\n\nIre is my sister Dupe’s baby. He was born December 3 and he is arguably the most beautiful baby I have ever seen.\n\nAfter I had washed my hands, I held him in my arms. He was sleeping. I am not sure he was aware I carried him. That experience for me was surreal. I had not felt that warmth of love for humanity in a long time. I carried him softly, cuddled him, and started to do what any woman would do intuitively, I took a walk around the house with him. The mother in me had woken up and I couldn’t help it.\n\nI would spend the next days just hovering around when he was being breast fed, sleeping, playing and being washed. I just wanted to carry him all the time.\n\nIre is my first experience with babies and he made it worth my while. He wasn’t accusing or questioning. He was simply trusting. He loved me just the way I was. I needed no qualifications to love, hold, comfort or care for him. Ire didnt care I have spots on the right side of my face or that I am ambidextrous.\n\nI started to observe his hand movements when he sucked his mother’s breasts, when he wanted to sleep, when he was satisfied, angry, impatient, soiled, distressed etc. I found that if you really look and observe, babies do communicate with us in a very specia l way. Ire did!\n\nI now know why my mum loves me unconditionally. I know why God does not mess around when I am involved. I know why when I call out to God he answers. I am like Ire to him. I know why Jesus wanted all the little children to come to him.\n\nThe desire to protect one’s family, to stand with a child in any circumstances is unexplainable. I simply became resolved to make Ire happy. Ire wont need to ask for anything. I will always be there for him.\n\nI noticed when he started to turn his head, his preference for his mum and the way he takes to sleep when his father carries him. I noticed his partiality for soul music. His father would often play him Christian tunes: music from his phone and Ire would gently begin to sleep. I noticed with his grandmother, he enjoyed the ‘Ekusa song’.\n\nIre has come into our lives to show us all that God is in the details. God made men perfect without blemish. Ire has come to remind us that the hand of God is in all we do. Ire entered into his 4th week on Thursday, he still doesn’t know he has touched a place in my heart I never even knew existed.\n\nIf I am this inspired by Ire I wonder how elated his parents must be each time they look at him or hold him in their arms.\n\nI am not sure when it happened. Ire and I made a bond. He let me carry him and he didn’t cry. When he smiled, it was like the heavens opened. It was beautiful. I cannot even begin to describe how beautiful it feels to hold Ire. He opens his fingers in an analytical way when he is being carried, about to cry, eating. We can begin to tell what he wants (almost) by following the opening of his hands. When he cries, it hurts.\n\nHolding Ire in my arms showed me that being a mother has simply got to be one of the most special and amazing l experiences in life . If you have a child, you are blessed. If you don’t have children yet, open your heart to some of the things we can learn from little babies. Before Ire I was just there, Ire opened me up to this world of opportunities and possibilities.\n\nIre gave me hope. I cannot put my hands on. Hope in the sense that this is what matters. Life is on many levels. The level with Ire would seem to be the highest there is. Now I know why my friends with children say their children remain the best thing in life to them. There is something exquisite about Ire: a purity, an innocence.\n\nGod uses the stupid things of the world to teach us wisdom. God used Ire to show me life was not in the glamour and sophistication of London, Lagos and New York. Ire is life. Perfect. Ideal.\n\nI know I will always be there for Ire. He wont need to call. I will always come running.\n\nI am back on the beat. I miss Ire, his mum and dad terribly. They made Ire possible. I felt their love and devotion to each other and Ire. I think I bonded even more with my sister than I have ever done in my entire life. Ire brought us closer.\n\nI left Ire with deeply convinced that life without children was not an option for me. Its a journey I must make. Soon.\n\nTundun Adeyemo\n\nOctober is Black History/Lesbian Gays Bisexual Transsexual Month. In parts of London and the UK, people have been marking this in various ways. To help us give that some perspective author Yemisi Ilesanmi, author of ‘Freedom to love for all, Homosexuality is not un-African’ sent the text version of the interview she did with me on Aukradio. She talks about why homosexuality is not just an European concept and much more. Enjoy reading.\n\nWhy did you write this book?\n\nThanks. I wrote this book to counter the erroneous impression that homosexuality is Un-African. This is a rhetoric that many African politicians keep sprouting in their bid to defend the discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and Transsexuals. With the upsurge of anti-gay bills springing up in many African countries, it became imperative to provide necessary information and create awareness on the issues of sexual orientation especially homosexuality and bisexuality. Information is power and education is key to human development. In this digital age, where information is easily accessible, it is sad to know that many people especially Africans still fall for the homophobic, biphobic and transphobic rhetoric that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.\n\nIn the book Freedom to Love For All; Homosexuality is not Un-African, I put together a collection of my essays debunking the myths that Homosexuality is Un-African. First, I started by clarifying the meaning of sexual orientation and providing accepted definition of the different kinds of sexual orientation and gender identity that we have. The first three chapters delved into known history of homosexuality and bisexuality in Africa. Noteworthy is the wall paintings in ancient Egypt of two black men kissing.\n\nThey were named khnumhotep and Niankhknum. They were ancient Egyptian royal servants, they are believed to be the first recorded same-sex couples in history. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, their names form a linguistic reference to their closeness. Niankhknum means joined to life and khnumhotep means joined to the blessed state of the dead, together the names can be translated as ‘Joined in life and joined in death’.\n\nAlso, there are other cultural practices in Africa that indicates not just the existence but acceptance of homosexuality, bisexuality and transsexuality in Africa.\n\nFor example, in Uganda some members of the Buganda royal family suggest that homosexuality was existent and tolerated before colonial rule. To this day, it is said that many members of the Buganda royal family are gay.\n\nAlso, until the practice died out in the early 20th century, male Azande warriors in the northern Congo routinely married male youths who functioned as temporary wives.\n\nMatriarchy was and is still strong in Calabar, Nigeria. In the absence of a male child, the eldest daughter in the family is allowed to marry another woman and have children together to carry on the family name.\n\nSome African cultures viewed transgender persons as gods. They were revered before imported, intolerant religions started making waves in Africa. It was the advent of colonisation and the import of foreign laws like sodomy law, which brought homophobia and intolerance into many African societies.\n\nFor example, Sango the Yoruba god of thunder was often described as a beautiful woman who dressed like a woman, had his hair braided and accessorised like a woman. Sango priests all men, still dress in clothing traditional associated with women when performing rituals. Homosexuality, bisexuality, and transsexuality are not concepts alien to Africa, Sexual orientation is not just a cultural thing, it is a biological.\n\nIt is 2014 and you would think most people are more accommodating? Is that your experience?\n\nSadly, that is not my experience in 2014 Africa. In civilized, western countries, the laws and people are tending towards tolerance, better understanding of diversity however, most African countries seem to be doing the opposite. Bills and laws criminalizing gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transexual are now the order of the day. Homophobia is celebrated as a godly thing. Since when is oppressing your fellow human being a thing to celebrate, especially when the person does not pose any threat to you or the society. I do hope with the right information, education, and awareness, we will overcome this tide of hate that Africans are projecting towards LGBTs. As you said, it is 2014; human relations should be getting better not worse\n\nIn your book, a lot of Nigerians have very myopic views to homosexuality. Could our generation change things?\n\nI believe every generation has a responsibility to leave the world a better place than we met it. The generations before us fought slavery, fought for the right to be treated as full members of the human society, women got the right to vote, inter-racial marriage was decriminalized and accepted as a normal thing, this generation is a beneficiary of the dividends of these civil rights movements struggles. It therefore lies on this generation to fight the good fight for equal right for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transsexuals. We hold in our power to effect a positive change and I know we can. We have access to information; we just have to let go of our myopic views and embrace rationality. Learn to love not germinate or spread hate.\n\nWhat annoys me is the hypocrisy with which Nigerian leaders deal with homosexuality. Are they capable of rational thought?\n\nUnfortunately, rational thought and Nigerian leaders do not belong in the same sentence.\n\nCorruption, hypocrisy, Boko Haram, stolen funds, bad infrastructures, bad governance are words that belong in the same sentence with Nigerian leaders. However, as the saying goes, every follower deserves the kind of leadership they get. Maybe Nigerians deserves their leaders after all the leadership is a reflection of the followership. I do hope there will be a positive change in the mind-set of Nigerians. The kind of change that would embrace rational thought, logic and tolerance. It is difficult but it is not impossible\n\nWhat is life like for people who are victims of homophobia? What more can we do to highlight the fact that my sexuality is not your business?\n\nVictims of homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are not allowed to be who they are because of the oppression, and discrimination, hostility expressed towards gays in Nigeria.\n\nGays can lose their life due to homophobia. Public humiliation and lynching are possibilities lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans people face. 14 years imprisonment for same sex couples is now law in Nigeria. Many are ostracized by family members and friends, loss of economic income, and loss of human rights are some of the injustice gays, lesbians, and bisexuals face in Nigeria and many African countries.\n\nThe law must highlight the fact that every Nigerian is entitled to inalienable human rights. The constitution asserts this, and laws that contradict the spirit and words of the constitutions should not be passed and if passed, the judiciary should step up and pronounce such laws null and void.\n\nWhat consenting adults do on the privacy of their rooms is not the business of the law. Nigerians should stop poke nosing into the bedrooms of their neighbours. Gays, lesbians and bisexuals have the right to engage in same-sex relationships just as heterosexuals have the right to engage in opposite sex relationships. It is their right. My right, my body, my choice, not your business. As long as I am not forcing you to have a relationship with me, you should mind your own business and keep out of my lovelife and sex life.\n\nHomophobia is a crime in the UK isn’t it? Why do you still work so hard on the message? Are people not getting it?\n\nIt is a good thing that homophobia is a crime in most developed countries now, including UK. However, there are still instances of homophobia especially within the black community. Many Nigerians living in UK are still homophobic, they might not express it openly for fear of the law, but that does not mean they are tolerant towards their fellow Nigerians or even family members who come out as gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans. Also, we are unfortunately witnessing some European countries like Russia retrogressing in terms of securing LGBT rights for their citizens. Therefore, we need to keep talking and working to make sure that the few rights that have been gained for and by LGBT people are not just taken away overnight. In addition, we need to build on these rights.\n\nAlso, we need to keep talking and working to secure LGBT rights in Africa, especially those of us who can do the work from a safe-place like UK. We need to put a face to the many faceless persecuted African LGBTs. We also must give a voice to the many silenced African LGBTs. We must use our safe-space to secure safety, rights, tolerance, and acceptance for our fellow African LGBTs. So the work must continue because an injury to one is an injury to all.\n\nYou have a very clear message to people who think and say homosexuality is unAFRICAN….. is there a reason why you are passionate about this?\n\nI am passionate about LGBT rights because first, I am an ardent believer in inalienable human rights and I believe every human being regardless of race, sex, gender or sexual orientation deserves to enjoy their inalienable human rights. I am also a bisexual, which makes me a target of the anti-lgbt laws. However, I believe fighting for equality and justice should be the responsibility of every decent and rational thinking human being , regardless of whether they are affected by atrocious laws or not. We should all be passionate about defending human rights for all.\n\nIf you had a message for governments in Africa who have penalized homosexuality, what would it be?\n\nMy message to African leaders who have penalized or thinking of penalizing same-sex relationships is that they should pick up a science book and read, read, read! Homosexuality is not a choice, just as heterosexuality is not a choice. Homosexuality is not harmful to anyone, just like heterosexuality is not harmful to anyone. Homosexuality is not a western thing; it is a human thing. Unless you want to claim Africans are not part of the human race, you do not have any reason at all to criminalize homosexuality, bisexuality, or trans sexuality. In addition, even if homosexuality was a choice, consensual adults have the right to engage in consensual sexual and emotional relationships. What consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedrooms is not the business of the law. Above all, African governments should concentrate on ridding the continent of corruption, poverty, and bad leadership. Homosexuality is not the problem of starving Africans; homosexuality is not a problem at all. Let African leaders think of ways to rejuvenate the economy of the continent and stay out of the bedrooms of Africans.\n\nCould you ever live anywhere in Africa? Is there a link between homosexuality and atheism?\n\nI am an African and a Nigerian, but home is where you feel safe. Unfortunately, with many African countries passing homophobic laws, I do not feel safe in some African countries including Nigeria. However, I will continue to fight for my right not to be discriminated against in my own country. Nigerian lesbians and gays deserve the same rights every other Nigerians citizens enjoy and that include the right to life, right to privacy and right to freedom of association, freedom of expression and the right to marry another consenting adult.\n\nThere is no link between homosexuality and atheism, but there is a link between rationally accepting the evidence that homosexuality is natural, and linking it with the way atheism is all about logic, rational argument, and evidence. It is foolhardy to continue to criminalise homosexuality when all rational evidence points to the fact that it is natural, not a choice, and not harmful to anyone.\n\nWhere can our listeners find your book? And perhaps more information about what you do.\n\nMy book Freedom To Love For All; Homosexuality is not Un-African is available in paperback and kindle edition on Amazon. My collection of poems titled ‘Reaching for the Stars’ will soon be available on Amazon. It is about empowerment, self-actualisation, culture, human rights, and feminism, tapping into our inner hero and reaching for the stars.

My main dream is to be able to have writing as my main living.\n\nHow did winning the SI Leeds Prize make you feel?\n\nIt was an utter shock! I listened as all the other entries read their work and thought I didn’t have a chance. It was great to win mainly because it gave me validation that I was on the right path with my writing.\n\nIs it luck or hard work?\n\nFor me, mainly hard work. I supply teach for a living but work part time so I can still write. If I didn’t dedicate a lot of years and hours to writing I wouldn’t have got where I am. At the same time you need the right people to see your work and love it. Not everyone is going to like what you’re doing so to find the people who do is like finding gold dust.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced in getting that award?\n\nI grew up in a Bengali family on a council estate in Leicester. I think the main challenge was that I wanted to be a writer but I didn’t see any writers out there like me. There was a handful or well-known Black and Asian writers as I was growing up but they were all from middle-class backgrounds. I hope this win shows that it doesn’t matter where you come from or how much money you have, you can still succeed in the field you’re passionate about.\n\nOn Saturday, you won another award The Bristol Short Story prize, surely your head must be spinning on this night, how did you keep calm?\n\nMy head is still spinning! I think I’m trying to appreciate this moment while it’s here. You never know how long it’s going to last.\n\nTell us about the short story that got you both awards.\n\nMy unpublished novel that won the SI Leeds is about a British Bengali girl growing up on a council estate in Leicester and how she copes with a condition called chronic pain syndrome. My short story that won the Bristol Short Story Prize is from the viewpoint of a housegirl (servant) in Bangladesh and what happens when a British-Bengali family come to visit the house she works in.\n\nWhat are your friends saying about you on Twitter?\n\nI’m not brilliant on Twitter and a lot of my friends aren’t even on it! But I’ve had huge support from fellow writers and lots of new followers. It’s all very exciting for me.\n\nIf you had only one wish right now, what would it be?\n\nI’m incredibly grateful for everything that’s happened. I think I’ve learnt it’s best to work hard and see what happens. Wishing isn’t what gets you anywhere, it’s planning and perseverance!\n\nWould you consider yourself a role model to other female writers in the UK?\n\nI hope I’m an example for both women and Black and Asian writers of what can be done. Sometimes we can be put in boxes but we don’t have to stay in them.\n\nWhat more can you add as an encouragement to budding writers?\n\nTo keep on writing and, more importantly, to LOVE writing. If you don’t love doing it then it doesn’t matter how many awards you receive, it’ll feel hollow. Of course there’s times when it feels hard and you don’t love writing so much – but if your heart is really in it, you will always go back to it. Tell your story the only way you can. Bring something new to the world.\n\nWhere can we find more about you?\n\nI’m on twitter and have a website at http://www.mahsudasnaith.com"
