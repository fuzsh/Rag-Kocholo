        "text": "Kemi is a twenty-something high-flying, born-again Christian advertising executive who must reconcile her newfound faith with a demanding career, pleasing her mixed-race family, trying to get over a non-believing ex-boyfriend Zack and living in the shadow of her best friend Vanessa with her perfect fiancé Mark.\n\nKemi’s faith is sometimes very strong and can resist temptations and other times God takes a back seat as the arms of Zack appears more alluring. How does she cope with being a Christian in the cut-throat world of advertising, being intimate with Zack and the joy of a personal relationship with Jesus?\n\nThis is a bold novel that tackles the moral decisions young women have to make about the crisis of faith, sex before marriage, unplanned pregnancy and career with openness, sensitivity and maturity."
