        "text": "The Lagos Port Complex also referred to as Premiere Port (Apapa Quays) is the earliest and largest Port in Nigeria. It is situated in Apapa, Lagos State, the commercial center of Nigeria. The Port was established in 1913 and construction of the first four deep water berths commenced in 1921. The Apapa Port is well equipped with modern cargo handling equipment and personnel support facilities making her cost effective and customer friendly. It enjoys intermodal connection â€“ Rail, Water and Road. It boasts of four wheel gate of about 8 meters for oversize cargoes and this has given the Port an edge over others in the handling of oversized cargoes.\n\nFor improved operational activities and efficiency the landlord Port model was introduced by the Federal Government and this later culminated in the concession of the terminals to private operators in 2006. Presently, the Lagos Port Complex has five (5) private Terminals with expert management and personnel that have both local and international experience in port operation. The Terminal Operators are: AP Moller Terminal Ltd. (APMT), ENL Consortium Ltd. (ENL), Apapa Bulk Terminal Ltd. (ABTL), Greenview Development Nigeria Ltd. (GNDL) and Lilypond Inland Container Terminal.\n\nThe Port also has two (2) Logistics bases- Eko Support Services Ltd. and Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics (LADOL) and eight (8) jetties. Sugar, Salt and Flour are produced in factories belonging to operators within the port.Lagos Port Complex is registered as an ISPS certified Port facility with the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The port offers 24hrs operation and vessel turnaround time is impressive. All operational areas are guarded by both armed and unarmed security personnel, as well as with Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) for effective manning.\n\nThe Concession has resulted in vast expansions in line with international best practices in Port infrastructure bringing about efficiency and improved productivity.\n\nWe therefore look forward to doing business with you."
