        "text": "Yanis T popped out of his mother’s womb like a scrawny multi-coloured chicken – This is the first sentence of the novel’s first chapter and its beauty remained printed in my heart until the moment I finished reading the novel. The novel did not only grip my heart and fingers as I flipped, it exposed the frankness of a good heart. This is not a novel about Christians that claim righteousness as if sin had never been part of their lives. This is a novel for every Christian to read and to learn. There is no pretence in Zack who is a newly converted born-again Christian. He is a growing Christian, and had to be frank about it. Kemi whose disconcerted behaviour in the beginning of the book could put off any man, had been born-again for a longer time despite an abortion attempt on her side… This is medium that passes a message to Christians. Christians should come out clean about the sins they struggle with. Zack in this beautiful sequel to ‘Kemi’s Journal’ is one among the most beautiful husbands I have ever met in real life and in books. Sanusi made him tolerate Kemi so much unlike other men in our society today. Even though he suspects Kemi of not loving their Son, Yannis T, in the way she should, he didn’t let an eruption destroy the eight year relationship that had once had some bad eggs.\n\nSanusi was able to connect a thread between Kemi (Zack’s fiancee/wife), Grace (Zack’s ex girlfriend) and Zack’s mother. All these three women had had desires of getting rid of an offspring(s). Grace was the worst if it came to a sentence because of the three abortions she had undergone. All were seeds of Zack. It had remained a sore wound in his heart till the end of the novel. Even Zack’s own mother was guilty of a similar deed. The mother had dumped Zack as a baby and fled. She never accepted him even after he had to find her… The woman Zack had chosen was Kemi, the one who had the desire of undergoing an abortion but didn’t do it due to the pressures mounted on her…\n\nSanusi was able to point out the concerns-shift of leading nations from the poverty and sicknesses in Africa to the terrorism fights around the world. She was able to point out the negative effect that was beginning to mount over the black continent.\n\nWhat I really admired in this story is: in as much as Grace and Maxine (Zack’s colleague at work) were painted as the bad eggs, Sanusi was able to point out the positive attitudes in them. As promiscuous as both women could be, Maxine knew bribery tasted so bad, and even Grace, felt that the distribution of condoms could enhance a healthier African continent. Grace’s role here could stand as a metaphor to the aids sown by developed countries around poorer countries today – Corrupt yet kind hearted; Selfish yet hardworking.\n\nSanusi uses the bible verses that Zack’s meditate on to preach through her story. The author unveils deeper meanings of these verses. Where I do have a problem was with Mark (a preacher) accepting he was infertile when the doctor said so. Most preachers in real life reject the sentence violently believing in miracles. Sanusi may justify this in the epilogue by stating that Mark and his wife, Vanessa were in hopes of having children. But I still see a fault in the lack of faith during the episode that Mark and his wife unveiled the doctor’s sentence to Zack and Kemi.\n\nAnd perhaps Sanusi is a writer who is uncomfortable with happy endings, and had to end the story sadly. I haven’t read ‘Kemi’s Journal’, the prequel, but I do applaud the writer’s sense of writing that I was never lost throughout my reading."
