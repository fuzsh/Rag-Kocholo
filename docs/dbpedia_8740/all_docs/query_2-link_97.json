        "text": "Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004) was an English general practitioner and is one of the most prolific serial killers in history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of the murder of 15 patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released.The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes. The inquiry identified 215 victims and estimated his total victim count at 250, about 80% of whom were elderly women. His youngest confirmed victim was a 41-year-old man, although \"significant suspicion\" arose that he had killed patients as young as four.Much of Britain's legal structure concerning health care and medicine was reviewed and modified as a result of Shipman's crimes. He is the only British doctor to have been found guilty of murdering his patients, although other doctors have been acquitted of similar crimes or convicted on lesser charges.Shipman committed suicide on 13 January 2004, one day prior to his 58th birthday, by hanging himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison.\n\nChristopher Whitelaw Pine, more commonly known as Chris Pine, was born in Los Angeles, California. As the son of actors Robert Pine and Gwynne Gilford, he was destined for the silver screen from an early age. Pine studied English at the University of California, Berkeley, and later attended the Williamstown Theatre Festival and the American Conservatory Theater, thereby solidifying his acting foundation. Pine's career took off in 2004 when he starred in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. However, it was his role as Captain James T. Kirk in the 2009 remake of Star Trek that catapulted him to international stardom. This marked the beginning of his successful stint with the Star Trek franchise, reprising his role in two subsequent sequels. His talent for embodying charismatic leaders extended to other films like Unstoppable, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and Wonder Woman, where he brought depth and complexity to every character. Despite being known for his action roles, Pine has demonstrated his versatility across a range of genres, from romantic comedies like This Means War to period dramas like Outlaw King. He has also lent his voice to animated films, notably Rise of the Guardians and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. His contributions to cinema have not gone unnoticed, earning him nominations for various accolades, including MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards.\n\nLeslie Cheung Kwok-wing (born Cheung Fat-chung; 12 September 1956 – 1 April 2003) was a Hong Kong-Canadian singer and actor. He is considered \"one of the founding fathers of Cantopop\" for achieving huge success both in film and music. Cheung debuted in 1977, and rose to prominence as a teen heartthrob and pop icon of Hong Kong in the 1980s, receiving numerous music awards including Most Popular Male Artist Awards at the 1988 and 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards. In 1989, Cheung announced his retirement from the music industry as a pop singer. Returning to the music scene after a five-year hiatus, Cheung released his chart-topping comeback album Most Beloved (寵愛) which achieved a huge market success. In 1999, he won the Golden Needle Award for his outstanding achievement as a musician at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, and his 1984 hit song Monica was voted as Hong Kong's \"Song of the Century\". He was honoured as \"Asia's Biggest Superstar\" at the 2000 CCTV-MTV Music Honours.Cheung won the 1991 Hong Kong Film Award (Days of Being Wild) and the 1994 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award (Ashes of Time) for best actor. He had also won the 1994 Japan Film Critics Society Award for best actor for his performance in Farewell My Concubine and ten other best actor nominations, five Golden Horse Awards, three Cannes Film Festival Awards, an Asia Pacific Film Festival Award, and a Venice Film Festival Award.Cheung's music and films not only captured fans in Hong Kong but also other Asian areas including Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Mainland China, Japan and South Korea. He is the first foreign artist to hold 16 concerts in Japan, a record that has yet to be broken and also a record holder as the best-selling C-pop artist in Korea.Cheung was ranked in the 100 years of Chinese cinema. In 2010, he was voted the third \"Most Iconic Musicians of All Time\" (after Michael Jackson and The Beatles) by CNN with more than 100,000 people casting their votes. CNN considered Cheung as the \"Most Beautiful Man from Hong Kong Cinema\" and one of \"Asia's 25 Greatest Actors of All Time\".Cheung was diagnosed with depression and committed suicide on April 1, 2003, by jumping off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hong Kong."
