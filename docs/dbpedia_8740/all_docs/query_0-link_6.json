        "text": "Delivery for this book is approximately 21 days\n\nEyo, an illiterate 10-year-old girl is trafficked to the UK with promises of a better life. The novel follows her five year journey as a domestic servant and eventual sex slave in the UK, her attempts to escape and her journey around the UK as she's passed from one human trafficker to another.\n\nEventually, she is rescued only to realise that in even in freedom, society demands an exacting price from those it should protect.\n\nAbidemi Sanusi was born in Lagos, Nigeria. She is the author of several fiction and devotional books. She studied at Leeds University in the UK, worked in human rights, and runs a writing services consultancy in the UK."
