        "text": "Also known as \"Èkó\", Lagos has been Nigeria's premier city since at least 1861. With its adjoining conurbation, Lagos is the largest city on the African continent and is one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Lagos initially emerged as a port city which originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island.\n\nLagos was previously Nigeria’s seat of government from the colonial days through its independence from the United Kingdom and continuing util the mid-80s, the capital was moved to Abuja in 1991.\n\nThe city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 10% of the country's GDP. Most commercial and financial business is carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions, and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent.\n\nThe Port of Lagos is Nigeria's leading port and one of the largest and busiest in Africa. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority and it is split into three main sections: Lagos port, in the main channel next to Lagos Island, Apapa Port (site of the container terminal) and Tin Can Port, both located in Badagry Creek, which flows into Lagos Harbour from the west."
