        "text": "Nigerian singer (born 1988)\n\nThis article is about a singer. For other uses, see SIMI.\n\nSimisola Bolatito Kosoko Listenⓘ (née Ogunleye; born April 19, 1988), better known by her stage name Simi, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, and actress.[1][2] She started her career as a gospel singer, releasing her debut studio album in 2008, titled Ogaju. She also played as one of the top judges in season 7 of the Nigerian idol TV show in 2022.[3] She gained public recognition in 2014 after releasing \"Tiff\", a song that was nominated for Best Alternative Song at The Headies 2015.[4] Simi signed a record deal with X3M Music in 2014, but left the label in May 2019 following the expiration of her contract.[5] She released her second studio album Simisola on September 8, 2017.[6][7] Her third studio album Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 was released to coincide with her thirty-first birthday on April 19, 2019.[1] She launched her record label Studio Brat in June 2019.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSimi was born on 19 April 1988 in Ojuelegba, a suburb of Surulere, Lagos State, as the last of four children.[9] In an interview with Juliet Ebirim of Vanguard newspaper, Simi revealed that her parents separated when she was 9 years old. She also revealed that she grew up as a tomboy.[10]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSimi attended Stars International College, a secondary school in Ikorodu, Lagos State.[11] She is an alumna of Covenant University, where she studied mass communication.[12]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2006–13: Career beginnings and Ogaju\n\n[edit]\n\nSimi grew up dancing and singing as a member of her local church's choir. She wrote her first song at age 10.[13] Her professional music career started in 2008 following the release of her debut studio album Ogaju, which consisted of a variety of songs such as \"Iya Temi\" and \"Ara Ile\". The album was produced entirely by Samklef.[14]\n\n2014–2018: Restless, Chemistry and Simisola\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2014, Simi released the 5 track EP Restless, which eventually earned her a record deal with X3M Music.[15] The EP is composed mostly of covers recorded by popular acts, including Rihanna's \"Man Down\" and Adele's \"Set Fire to the Rain\".[16]\n\nOn January 9, 2014, Simi released two singles \"Tiff\" and \"E No Go Funny\". Both songs received frequent airplay and were met with generally positive reviews from critics. The video for \"Tiff\" was directed by Josh Clarke and released on August 30, 2015.[17] The song was nominated for Best Alternative Song at the 2015 edition of The Headies.\n\nLater in 2015, Simi won the Most Promising Act to Watch category at the 2015 Nigeria Entertainment Awards. In an interview with Leadership newspaper, Simi revealed that she started working on her second studio album, which was slated for release in 2016.[18] Upon releasing \"Jamb Question\", Simi was listed as one of the artistes to watch out for in 2016 by NotJustOk.[19] The remix of \"Jamb Question\" features Nigerian rapper Falz.\n\nOn February 14, 2016, Simi released the Oscar Heman Ackah-produced love ballad \"Love Don't Care\". It received frequent radio airplay and was met with positive reviews.[20] \"Love Don't Care\" effectively addresses tribalism and discrimination in Nigeria.[21] The song's music video was directed by Clarence Peters. In October 2016, Simi was nominated for Best Breakthrough Act at the MTV Africa Music Awards.[22] On October 27, Simi collaborated with Falz to release the extended play Chemistry. Oghene Michael of 360 Nobs described the EP as an \"experiment of the word art\". In December 2016, Simi was nominated in three categories at The Headies 2016, winning one.[23]\n\nIn anticipation of her 12-track second studio album Simisola, Simi released two singles; \"Smile for Me\" and \"Joromi\". Both songs were accompanied by music videos directed by Clarence Peters and Aje Films, respectively.[24] Music videos for \"O Wa Nbe\", \"Complete Me\", \"Gone for Good\" and \"Aimasiko\" were also released to further promote the album. Simi unveiled the album's track listing on September 1, 2017. Simisola was released seven days later and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard World Albums chart.[25][26][27]\n\n2019: Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 and Studio Brat\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 2019, Simi disclosed that she would be releasing her third studio album Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 to coincide with her birthday on April 19, 2019. She disclosed this information in a series of social media messages.[28] The album is a slight departure from the relatively afro-centric feel of Simisola (2017).[29] It is a mixture of sentimental ballad, Afropop, Afro-fusion, Afro-soul, R&B, EDM and moombahton.[29] The 13-track album features guest vocals from Patoranking, Maleek Berry, Falz, and her husband Adekunle Gold. Its production was primarily handled by Oscar, with additional production from Vtek, Legendury Beatz, and Sess.[30] Simi dedicated the album to her father Charles Oladele Ogunleye, who died in 2014.[29] Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 was preceded by three singles: \"I Dun Care\", \"Lovin\" and \"Ayo\".\n\nIn May 2019, X3M Music announced Simi's departure following the expiration of her recording contract. Both parties did not renew the contract and agreed to part ways.[31] In June 2019, Simi announced the launch of her independent record label, Studio Brat.[8]\n\nShe released a song titled 'Duduke' in the year 2020 making her unborn baby, a symbol of love and hope.[32]\n\n2020: Restless II EP\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, Simi released another EP titled Restless II which is part two of the initial Restless EP released in 2014.[33]\n\n2022: TBH (To Be Honest) album\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Studio Brat headliner, Simisola Kosoko, highly identified by her stage name Simi has recently unlocked her much anticipated studio project captioned \"To Be Honest\" album.[34]\n\nTBH (To Be Honest) is the fourth studio album by the Nigerian singer, Simi, and a follow-up to her current EP, \"Restless II\" which was launched in 2020.\n\nThe body of work TBH (To Be Honest) houses 11 stable tracks and has the likes of Fave, Deja, and naturally her husband, Adekunle Gold.\n\nHer achievement on this studio project stretched to her selection as Spotify EQUAL Africa music program ambassador for July. She become the second African artiste after Tiwa Savage, to be named an EQUAL global and EQUAL African artiste.[35]\n\nThe Spotify EQUAL program aims to foster gender equality and provide a platform to celebrate influential female artists. She joins a list of talented African women who are driving the culture and breaking through barriers in the music industry.\n\n2024: Fifth studio album\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an interview with African Folder, Simi revealed she is working on her fifth studio album. According to Simi, her favourite thing about the album is that she had the freedom to make music the way she enjoyed it.[36]\n\nArtistry\n\n[edit]\n\nApart from being a singer and songwriter, Simi is also a sound engineer. She is credited with mixing and mastering Adekunle Gold's debut studio album Gold, which was released in July 2016.[37] Her music style is basically hinged in the rhythm and blues, soul and hip hop music genres.[38]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSimi married a singer named Adekunle Gold in a private wedding ceremony on January 9, 2019.[39] It was later revealed that they had been dating for five years.[40] Simi became a mother for the first time on the 30th of May 2020 when she gave birth to her daughter Adejare.[41][42]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nShe made her acting debut in Kunle Afolayan's directorial Mokalik.[43]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nMokalik (2019)\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nOgaju (2008)\n\nChemistry (with Falz) (2016)\n\nSimisola (2017)\n\nOmo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 (2019)\n\nTo Be Honest (2022)\n\nLost and Found (2024)\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nRestless (2014)\n\nRestless II (2020)\n\nSelected singles\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles as lead artist, showing year released and album name Title Year Album \"Ara Ile\" 2008 Ogaju \"Emi L'Onijo\" 2012 Non-album single \"Take a Chance\" \"Chocolate Brown\" \"Don't Judge Me (cover)\" 2013 \"Bibanke (cover)\" \"Marvin's Room (cover)\" \"Tiff\" 2014 Simisola \"E No Go Funny\" Non-album single \"Jamb Question\" 2015 Simisola \"Jamb Question\" (Remix) (featuring Falz) Non-album single \"Open and Close\" \"Love Don't Care\" 2016 Simisola \"Smile for Me\" 2017 \"Joromi\" \"I Dun Care\" 2018 Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1 \"Lovin\" \"Ayo\" 2019 \"Duduke\" 2020 Non-album single \"There for You\" \"Borrow Me Your Baby\" (featuring Falz) [44] 2024\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nSimi awards and nominations\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAward\n\nWins\n\nNominations\n\nThe Headies 7 18Nigeria Entertainment Awards 1 3City People Entertainment Awards 3 3Nigeria Music Video Awards 0 3MTV Africa Music Awards 0 1Nigerian Teen Choice Awards 1 1NET Honours 1 1\n\nTotals[a]Wins13Nominations30\n\nNote\n\n^ Certain award groups do not simply award one winner.
