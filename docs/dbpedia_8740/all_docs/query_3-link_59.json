        "text": "Link to Joe Holden user page\n\nJoe Holden\n\nGlobal Relationship Manager\n\nThinking about moving to Nigeria? Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and home to Africa’s biggest economy. Its climate is tropical, with wet and dry seasons. There is an exciting mix of cultures: more than 200 ethnicities and 400 languages! Oil and gas industries continue to thrive along its Atlantic coast, and a large number of new and emerging sectors include mining and construction, telecommunications, IT, and financial management. No wonder there are so many expats in the country.\n\nDue to long standing political and cultural unrest, widespread corruption remains a major challenge to the country’s global reputation. Healthcare in Nigeria also has its difficulties. But despite this, Nigeria has a growing number of expat communities who report a high quality of life, enjoying many luxuries not accessible at home. In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about living and moving to Nigeria as an expat, including cost of living, moving expenses, jobs and visas, health insurance and more. Read below to understand what life in Nigeria is like, and get a checklist to help you with your move.\n\nLiving in Nigeria is exciting. Zuma Rock is a large monolith near Abuja, Nigeria / GETTY IMAGES\n\nLife in Nigeria: what to expect from living in Nigeria as an expat\n\nDue to the highly dense populations in Nigerian cities, expats’ first impression may well be crowds and chaos. Life in Nigeria is different. The pace of life is fast, and congestion and poverty are everywhere. However, Nigerians are outgoing and friendly, and welcome new arrivals with open arms.\n\nIs Nigeria a good place to live?\n\nYes, just bear in mind that Nigeria is a country of contradictions. While there are huge problems with overpopulation, outdated infrastructure, and high unemployment, Nigeria remains an up-and-coming destination for expats. Many who have already made the move describe their new home as vibrant, and colourful, and a survey by InterNations found that Nigeria has more expats earning over US$250,000 than any other country on earth.\n\nThe expat community is close, but those making the effort to get to know the Nigerian people will make new and interesting friends. Beyond the urban industrial centres, the country boasts fabulous landscapes and wildlife reserves all waiting to be discovered.\n\nWhat is life in Nigeria like?\n\nNigeria is located in West Africa. It has a rich landscape which ranges from tropical rainforests and grassy savannah to the deserts. In the capital, Abuja, temperatures range from 18 °C to 36 °C.\n\nNigeria has an enormous cultural diversity with over 200 ethnic groups, speaking more than 400 languages and living side-by-side. Life in Nigeria is interesting because of the religious breakdown: people living in Nigeria are half Christian, half Muslim. Cultural exports include a richly spiced, aromatic cuisine, the Afrobeat music of Fela Kuti and the Nobel winning literature of Wole Soyinka.\n\nHow to become an expat in Nigeria\n\nMany expats in Nigera have been relocated by employers. Overseas packages usually include accommodation, and many companies own properties or complexes for their overseas staff.\n\nAnother option is to sub-let from a colleague or friend, but if you don’t have accommodation or employment, moving to Nigeria as an expat is not advised.\n\nIs Nigeria safe for expats?\n\nNigeria has a reputation for reported incidents of kidnapping and crime, and safety can be a major concern for expats moving to the country.\n\nUK Government travel advice states that foreigners in Nigeria should be vigilant at all times and keep others informed of your travel plans.\n\nIf you’re working and living in Nigeria you should follow your employer’s security advice, make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.\n\nAccommodation compounds usually have 24-hour security, which may include armed guards, security cameras and access control.\n\nThe Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos, Nigeria / GETTY IMAGES\n\nHow is the political situation in Nigeria?\n\nUnder the 1999 constitution, executive power is vested in the President who is directly elected to a four-year term. There are two tiers of government below the federal level, state and local. The Nigerian Police Force is known for being inefficient, and corruption is widespread, threatening the country’s long term stability.\n\nHowever, increasing inward investment by overseas companies, supported by their own measures to support and protect employees, mean that, to some extent, expats are protected from the endemic threats to Nigeria’s growth and prosperity.\n\nGDP, Nigeria, Maddison 2020 world regions stacked area. GDP adjusted for price changes over time (inflation) and price differences between countries – it is measured in international-$ in 2011 prices\n\nLanguage in Nigeria. Do expats need to learn the local language?\n\nThe official language in Nigeria is English, which is used for all official communications. However, there is a rich and diverse range of indigenous languages, including the most common, Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba.\n\nHausa was an official language of the northern states from 1951 to 1967. It is the most widely spoken language. It is probably the most scholastically studied indigenous West African language, which makes it one of the easiest African languages to learn. The Yoruba people are well travelled and scattered across major continents in the world.\n\nLooking for health insurance for living in Nigeria?\n\nFind out about our expat insurance plans\n\nCost of living in Nigeria\n\nThe cost of living in Nigeria is relatively high, but it depends where you are from. It also differs across the country.\n\nCost of living in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nFamily of four estimated monthly costs are US$2,148.25 (926,604.63₦) without rent.\n\nA single person estimated monthly costs are US$581.39 (250,771.77₦) without rent.\n\nLagos is 60.92% less expensive than New York (without rent).\n\nRent in Lagos is, on average, 48.28% lower than in New York.\n\nWhat about cost of living in Nigeria vs USA?\n\nCost of living in Nigeria is, on average, 56.95% lower than in United States. Rent in Nigeria is, on average, 31.18% lower than in United States.\n\nOn average, the monthly cost of living in Nigeria for an individual is roughly US$120. For the family the average cost of living in Nigeria is about US$359.\n\nThe costs of utilities and security are often covered by employers, but there may be extra expenses to consider. For instance, the country’s poor power supply means many Nigeria expats need to invest in a generator, which is expensive to buy and maintain.\n\nLocal produce is generally cheap and available at local markets. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic society, with huge variation in foods and flavors across the different regions. Expats will find meat, seafood, and many exotic fruits, all year round at colorful markets in towns and cities. However, the costs of imported Western food items are significantly inflated.\n\nNigeria’s cities are filled with high-end shopping malls, where luxury items and international fashions are readily available, but these will come at a cost.\n\nThe vast majority of expat children attend international schools, at significant expense, whilst others are home schooled. Read more about relocating with kids.\n\nBanking and finance in Nigeria\n\nThe official currency of Nigeria is the Nigerian naira (NGN). One naira is divided into 100 kobo. There are eight naira notes, and coins are 1 and 2 NGN and 50 kobo.\n\nNigeria is the financial capital of Africa. It has seen huge financial growth over recent years, and many Nigeria expats are now returning from abroad to benefit from the strongest economy of any African country.\n\nLocal and international banks, including Ecobank Nigeria, Access Bank, Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank and Union Bank of Nigeria offer services to expats, but due to security concerns and the unreliable nature of Nigerian banking systems, most expats prefer to maintain an offshore bank account, using a local account for day-to-day living.\n\nCash is still necessary for many purchases. ATM and credit card fraud are prevalent, and expats in Nigeria should take care when withdrawing and carrying cash, and monitor their bank statements and transaction history closely.\n\nTraffic in African megacity, Lagos in Nigeria / GETTY IMAGES\n\nHealthcare in Nigeria\n\nDespite Nigeria being a developed country, diseases such as cholera, tetanus and polio, malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis are still common.\n\nHealth facilities in the country are limited, and are well below Western standards. Public healthcare is adequate for routine treatments and check-ups, but is hugely underfunded. Expats in Nigeria are advised to secure international health insurance to cover anything more than basic medical treatments, including medical evacuation.\n\nHow did Nigeria deal with COVID-19?\n\nSub-saharan Africa has, so far, escaped the predicted high numbers of cases and deaths from Covid-19. Nigeria, with a population of over 200 million, reported just 33,000 cases and 750 deaths.\n\nThese numbers are subject to question, as testing and control across all 36 states have been difficult to mandate and implement, but fears of overflowing hospitals have failed to materialise. Numbers are currently rising, but not exponentially, testing programmes are being rolled out, and restrictions on gatherings, distancing, and mask wearing, are still in place.\n\nQuality healthcare in Nigeria is limited\n\nFind out how health insurance works in Nigeria for expats\n\nSuleja Dam – Abuja, Nigeria / GETTY IMAGES\n\nExpat living in Nigeria: how can I find accommodation?\n\nWhere do expats live in Nigeria?\n\nThe top locations for expats in Nigera are the two largest cities; Lagos and Abuja.\n\nThose heading for Abuja, which is increasingly commercial, may find the cost of living particularly steep. Meanwhile, the most affluent areas of Lagos are Ikoyi, popular among expats in the oil and gas industries, and Victoria Island, where some of the most expensive real estate can be found. The seaport of Apapa, with its old colonial houses, and apartment complexes, is a more economical choice for expats in Nigeria.\n\nThese areas, together with the luxurious man-made Banana Island, are among the safest for living in Nigeria, though most residences are within expat compounds, or walled enclosures, complete with armed guards, which may make for a less-than-inclusive experience.\n\nHow can I find accommodation in Nigeria as an expat?\n\nFinding a property as an expat in Nigeria can be difficult. Demand outweighs supply and even professionals will struggle to find Western standard accommodation on a rental budget. The most settled Nigeria expats are those who have been relocated by their employers, many of whom own or secure suitable homes for their staff, and cover rent and expenses.\n\nIf accommodation hasn’t been arranged prior to your arrival, you may have to stay in a hotel near your place of work for a while after you arrive.\n\nCan expats buy property in Nigeria?\n\nThe Nigerian Land Use Act of 1978 reverted all land ownership back to the State, therefore land cannot be owned privately.\n\nHowever, foreigners can obtain leases for the use of land, for a maximum of 99 years. This requires a certificate from the relevant State Governor, which gives permission for occupation and improvement of property, but does not include the rights to sell, give, or sub-let.\n\nPurchasing property in Nigeria also carries additional risk. Under national and state laws, the Government can re-take land without compensation, and there are reported examples of people re-assigning land they do not own. Borders between states are not necessarily established, so demarcation of ownership/responsibility may be disputed.\n\nYou may like: How Does Health Insurance Work In Nigeria For Expats?\n\nBustling market street in Lagos, Nigeria / GETTY IMAGES\n\nJobs, visas and working in Nigeria\n\nExpat jobs in Nigeria\n\nNigeria’s biggest industry is oil, and most multinational oil companies have a major presence, contributing over 95% of the country’s foreign exchange earnings. Expats also find opportunities in other growing sectors, such as mining, construction, IT, telecommunications and general business.\n\nMost expats are highly skilled and qualified, working in project management, HR, engineering or IT. Those with skills in journalism, communications and health sciences are also seeing increasing opportunities, and several NGO agencies and the UN use Nigeria as their West African base.\n\nExpat salary in Nigeria\n\nSalaries for expats in Nigeria can be up to 45% higher than those in the UK. This is to cover higher rental prices and the costs of safety measures that come with working in an African country. However, some benefits packages for expats also include free or subsidised accommodation and chauffeured transport.\n\nWhat is an average expat salary in Nigeria?\n\nAverage expat salary in Nigeria is US$30,000. 12% of expat households in Nigeria are now earning more than US$250,000 per annum.\n\nHow is income tax calculated in Nigeria?\n\nIncome tax in Nigeria is calculated on a progressive scale from 7 to 24% on total income. Expats may be eligible for double-taxation exemption if their home country has a tax agreement with Nigeria, and other relevant factors are duration of stay and location. It’s a complex system and referring to a qualified tax consultant is recommended.\n\nDo you need a visa to live and work in Nigeria?\n\nUnless you are from an exempted country, you will require a visa to live and work in Nigeria.\n\nVisas need to be arranged before arrival, and applications can be made online via the Nigerian Immigration Service. Applicants will need to visit their nearest Nigerian consulate with the relevant paperwork for an interview.\n\nThere are six types of visa in Nigeria:\n\nTransit\n\nDirect Transit\n\nBusiness\n\nTourist\n\nOfficial/diplomatic, temporary work\n\nSubject to Regularisation (STR)\n\nThe STR visa is required for expats who are planning to work in Nigeria. This is a single-entry visa that is valid for 90 days, at which point holders can apply for a long-term work permit or the equivalent of a Nigerian green card. To apply for an STR visa, expats need to have confirmed a job with an employer beforehand, and the employer must have received Expatriate Quota approval from the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nDocuments required:\n\nValid passport with minimum of 6 months validity\n\nLetter of employment\n\nExpatriate quota approval\n\nCredentials of the applicant\n\nDuly completed form IMM 22\n\nCurriculum Vitae or Resume\n\nFor chief executive officers (CEOs) of corporate organizations, an extract of the minutes of the Board’s resolution is required. This is only obtainable from Nigerian Missions in the countries where applicants must have been living for at least six months\n\nIn addition, expats planning to drive in the country must apply for a Nigerian driving license, as an international license is not recognized. This will involve a test at an accredited driving school. However, driving is not recommended and most Nigeria expats hire the services of a driver.\n\nWant more expat content?\n\nSubscribe to our fortnightly newsletter!\n\nEnter your email address\n\nComments\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nLife in Nigeria can be very picturesque.

Business structures are hierarchical and largely paternalistic.\n\nThere are plenty of modern restaurants in Nigerian cities serving both local and international cuisine. The majority of northern Nigeria’s population is Muslim, so pork is difficult to come by, and even forbidden in some areas.\n\nNigerians are extremely social people. Alcohol is widely available, except in specific Muslim areas. However, expats should refrain from drinking in public during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nBefore you go…\n\nMoving to another country can be challenging, but you can ensure peace of mind by making sure you have the right international health insurance.\n\nFor 30 years, we have helped expats like you move and settle into their new lives overseas, with the peace of mind of knowing their families are covered by a comprehensive and flexible health insurance policy.\n\nSpeak to us today to find out more about how international health insurance could benefit you and your family – and good luck moving to Nigeria!\n\nLooking for expat health insurance before your move to Nigeria?\n\nLearn more about our plans\n\nRelated articles\n\nRead More\n\nThe Cost Of Living In Indonesia For Expats\n\nFind out how the cost of living crisis has affected expats and digital nomads living in Indonesia.\n\nRead More\n\nLiving in Bangladesh: A Guide To Moving To Bangladesh As An Expat\n\nDiscover all the basics of moving to Bangladesh, including the best places to live and healthcare options.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat You Need To Know About Different Types Of Healthcare Systems Around The World\n\nDiscover different healthcare systems you may encounter and how they could impact you.\n\nRead More\n\nWhere Will You Need International Health Insurance For Overseas Study?\n\nIf you’re planning to study abroad, you might be wondering if you need international health insurance."
