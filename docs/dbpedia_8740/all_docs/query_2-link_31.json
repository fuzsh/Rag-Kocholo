Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strand of coronavirus, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [1–3]. The Chinese government reported the virus to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019 [4]. By 22 January 2020, a total of 571 cases of COVID-19 were reported in 25 provinces in China [5]. Despite the drastic, large-scale containment measures promptly implemented by the Chinese government, in a matter of a few weeks the disease had spread well outside China, and several countries have been facing with a global threat of the disease [2, 6, 7]. More than 210 countries of the world have been affected by COVID-19 epidemic [7], leading to its declaration as a global pandemic on 11 March 11 2020 by WHO [1, 8, 9].\n\nFollowing the first positive confirmed case of COVID-19 in Singapore, the COVID-19 threat became more apparent in Malaysia as eight close contacts to the first case were identified to be in Johor [4]. On 25 January 2020, Malaysia announced its first (index) case of COVID-19 [10]. The first wave of the disease lasted from 24 January to 16 February 2020 with a number of cases totalling 22, which is mainly comprised infected individuals arriving from China [4]. The disease has spread very fast all over the country after 27 February 2020 due to the community transmission, establishing the beginning of its second wave [4]. On 5 April 2020, the number of cases increased to 3662 [10]. This spike in COVID-19 cases was attributed to a special religious gathering which took place between 27 February and 2 March 2020 at Sri Petaling mosque, whereby larger number of cases might be imported by the international participants [10]. Thus, the potential scale of COVID-19 epidemic became apparent in the country. According to [10], the sudden rise in COVID-19-confirmed cases could mean that the asymptomatic infected individuals could significantly spread the disease. Malaysia is currently experiencing the third wave of COVID-19, which broke out on 20 September 2020. By 31 December 2020, the number of reported cases of the pandemic has cumulated to 113,010, including 471 deaths, 88941 recovered cases, and 23598 active cases [11].\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus from the family of Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus [14]. RNA viruses have high rates of mutation. This feature profoundly influences disease emergence, viral evolution, appearance of drug resistances, and vaccine efficacy [12]. Then, it is critical to monitor the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 mutation in order to understand its infectivity, virulence, and pathogenicity for a vaccine development [13]. In [14], the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia was studied by sequencing four genomes from the country during the second wave of infection. The lineage B.6 strain was found to be predominant, implying a local evolution [14]. All the circulating strains in Malaysia were introduced from different countries. In October 2020, a new strain of the disease, D614G, was detected in Sabah state of the nation. It was reported that the strain is 10 times more infectious than the previous strains [15].\n\nCOVID-19 is a disease which targets the respiratory system of humans [5]. It is transmitted from human-to-human via direct contact with contaminated surfaces and by inhaling the respiratory droplets from COVID-19-infected humans during coughing and sneezing [4, 5, 16]. The incubation period for COVID-19 has been reported to range between 0 and 14 days, although a longer incubation period of 25 days is found in the literature [8]. The rate of recovery from the disease infection is higher than the mortality rate, but this ratio varies from one country to another as well as region to region [7]. The primary symptoms of COVID-19 are severe chest pain, high fever, body aches, headache, consistent dry coughing, and complication in the respiratory system [7].\n\nCurrently, there is no approved vaccine or a specific anti-viral treatment therapy to prevent or manage COVID-19, although several studies on vaccine invention are ongoing [5, 7]. Thus, control measures against the disease transmission are focusing on the use of basic non-pharmaceutical control interventions [8, 17]. These include movement control order, early detection, good hygiene practices [8], social distancing, use of face masks in public, quarantine of the suspected exposed individuals, isolation of positive (or confirmed) cases for prompt treatment, contact tracing [5, 8, 17], mandatory lockdowns, avoiding crowded events, imposing a maximum number on individuals in any gathering (religious and social) [5]. Currently, the most widely used control strategy for mitigating the pandemic spread is self-quarantine, wearing face masks while in public and social distancing [1]. To effectively reduce the spread and the prevalence of the disease in the affected countries, the concerned authorities have implemented many of these control intervention measures. However, individual nation also has its own policy in curbing the transmission dynamics of the disease in its territory [16].\n\nTo curb COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, a targeted testing approach has been announced by the government through the Ministry of Health in order to optimize the use of the limited medical resources available in the country. In targeted testing, tests are conducted on only high-risk groups at COVID-19 hotspot zones. However, some medical practitioners have questioned this approach, which reckon that COVID-19 testings should be conducted as wide as possible so that most (if not all) of the possible cases in the country would be detected. Then, the possible patients could be placed on a 14-day quarantine and be treated so as to contain the spread of the disease [18].\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the Malaysian Government announced a nationwide movement control order (MCO) to last between 18 and 31 March 2020 in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing. The restricted activities prohibit all mass movements and gatherings across the country, including religious, sports, social, and educational activities. The movement control order was implemented in several stages with strict enforcement increasing with each stage to gain the public compliance to the restrictions [10]. MCO had been extended for a number of times [4].\n\nFrom mathematical point of view, the transmission and control dynamics of several infectious diseases have been described by compartmental models governed by autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in various works [1, 3, 5, 6, 8–10, 16–38]. These models help to facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transmission dynamics of the diseases and gain insightful information about the efficacy of any implemented control intervention strategies in controlling their spread in a population. Several mathematical models have been formulated and analysed specifically for the dynamics of COVID-19 population in various countries ([1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 18, 20–25]), while the effects of different control intervention measures on the disease spread in a community have been evaluated using autonomous systems of ODEs in many other previous studies (e.g. see [5, 8, 16, 17, 26–38] and some of the references therein).\n\nUsing fractional differential operator approach, a mathematical model governing the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy was developed in [22]. Theoretical analysis of the fractional model suggests that the disease is stable if the basic reproduction number R0 is below unity. This result can be helpful in introducing appropriate interventions and design a suitable strategy for control implementation to effectively contain the disease transmission in the country. Similarly, Cooper et al. [1] used a mathematical model as a theoretical framework to examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 within a community. The model was applied to the disease outbreaks in six different countries that are China, South Korea, India, Australia, USA, and Italy. The model fitting makes use of the reported data between January and June 2020 (covering the period of movement control order and control measures) from each country. It was deduced from the study that the dynamics of COVID-19 can be under control in each of the communities under consideration, if proper restrictions and timely implementation of strong control policies are put in place to control the rates of infection.\n\nIn [20], a compartmental model was analysed to predict the dynamical behaviour of the infected individual subpopulation in the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Numerical simulations depict that the second wave of the disease will be more severe than the first. The authors observed that increasing the recovery rate of the infected humans by adopting necessary pharmaceutical measures is an essential strategy to prevent the disease incidence of a number of people. Also, Alsayed et al. [10] constructed a mathematical model to predict the peak and the number of infected cases of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia. The results of simulations show that the epidemic peak could be reached in the period ranging from 12 July to 11 August 2020, and last until the period ranging from 22 November 2020 to 12 January 2021.\n\nThe classical SIR model was adapted to analyse the epidemic of COVID-19 in Italy by D’Arienzo and Coniglio [25]. The model was analysed to assess the basic reproduction number, R0, associated with the model based on the reported data from the early phase of the disease outbreak in the country. The R0 value was estimated to range between 2.43and3.10, indicating the potential of the disease to invade the population. In a similar study [21], a compartmental mathematical model based on SEIR modelling structure was proposed for COVID-19 disease by specifically focusing on the super-spreaders individuals transmissibility. The local asymptotic dynamics of the model was discussed in terms of R0 associated with the model. The model was trained in data from reported cases of the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, China.\n\nFurthermore, a comparative assessment of the evolution of COVID-19 outbreaks in China, Italy, and France using a compartmental model based on SIR model framework was carried out in [6]. The model was used to analyse the effect of lockdown on the disease spread in the population for the time window 22 January to 15 March 2020. Numerical simulations indicate that implementation of lockdown control policy can help in reducing the epidemic peak and mortality rate in the countries under investigation.\n\nIn [5], a mathematical model was formulated and analysed to assess the impact of effective social distancing and face mask usage on COVID-19 population dynamics in Lagos, Nigeria. The simulated results of the model revealed that the disease will be eliminated in the population if about 55% of the population comply with the regulation of social distancing and about 55% of the population make effective use of face mask while in public. Liu et al. [26] also used a compartmental model to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 population with reference to the South Korea, Italy, and Spain epidemics. The model incorporates a time-varying disease transmission rate capturing the effect of government and social distancing control interventions. The study reveals that it is possible to contain the disease spread in the three countries. The authors warned that an early reduction in social distancing control policy or too extensive implementation of the control measure can lead to the disease epidemic entering a new phase.\n\nA compartmental model incorporating the effects of vaccination and isolation intervention measures for the dynamics of COVID-19 population in Indonesia was proposed in [16]. The global asymptotic behaviour of the model was discussed in terms of its R0. The simulation results indicate that administration of vaccination control can accelerate the healing of COVID-19 infections and the disease spread can be slow down drastically by implementing the maximum effort of isolation control measure. In another work [9], a mathematical model taking into account the impact of healthcare capacity was formulated for the population dynamics of COVID-19 and control in Italy. Qualitative analysis of the model was carried out to reveal the global stability of the disease. The study suggests that the numbers of beds, ventilators, and intensive care units should be increased to considerably reduce the number of COVID-19 infections in the country.\n\nAlso, an intelligent computing paradigm based on Levenberg–Marquardt artificial neural networks was developed for the solution of mathematical model for COVID-19 population dynamics in metropolitans of Pakistan and China by Cheema et al. [54]. Ciufolini and Paolozzi [56, 60] carried out mathematical studies by using Gauss error function type to predict the evolution in time of the number of positive cases for COVID-19 outbreaks in Italy. In [61], two mathematical models were formulated to separately analyse the fast-growth phase and interpret the whole data set for China and South Korea COVID-19 outbreaks between 22 February and 20 May 2020. It was concluded that the models can be used in interpreting data and as prediction guide for the disease.\n\nA deterministic model based on SIR framework was proposed to understand the evolution of COVID-19 outbreaks during lockdown and social distancing policy in Germany and Italy by Ianni and Rossi [57]. Similarly, Köhler-Rieper et al. [58] proposed a new approach to mathematical modelling of COVID-19 transmission dynamics by constructing a single ordinary integro-differential equation. It was shown that the model has similarities with the classical SIR model, and capable of predicting the disease outbreaks for a period of about 4 weeks.\n\nOlaniyi et al. [59] formulated a deterministic model governing an autonomous system of ODEs for the dynamics of COVID-19 population in Nigeria. The study reveals that R0 value for the disease outbreak in the country can be reduced below one if the current disease effective transmission rate is lowered by 50%. Owing to this fact, the authors further used Pontryagin maximum principle to analyse the impacts of time-dependent preventive and management control measures in mitigating the spread of the disease. It was found that the number of infectious individuals can be reduced drastically by implementing the combined effort of the two control interventions.\n\nIt is evident that increasing the recovery rate of the infected humans by adopting necessary pharmaceutical measures is also an essential strategy to prevent COVID-19 incidence of a number of people in a population [20]. However, none of the previous studies has investigated the impacts of combining pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures in a bid to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Hence, a mathematical model involving an autonomous system of ODEs for COVID-19 population dynamics, which does not only used to assess the effect of non-pharmaceutical control measures but also pharmaceutical control interventions on the disease spread in Malaysia, is proposed in the present study. First, a basic COVID-19 model is developed and the nonlinear least square curve fitting approach is employed to estimate the model parameters by providing a good fit to the daily COVID-19-confirmed cases in Malaysia. Further, the basic model is modified to include five different control parameters accounting for personal protection (such as the use of hand sanitizer, face mask wearing, and social distancing policy), contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals, and treatment controls of the timely diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, and hospitalized individuals to assess an effective strategy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in a population.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in the following order: Sect. 2 presents the model description and formulation. Qualitative analysis of the basic properties of the model is discussed in Sect. 3. Model fitting is also considered. In Sect. 4, numerical simulations of the model are performed, and the results are also presented. This is followed up by detail discussions of results in Sect. 5. Section 6 provides a concluding remark of this study.\n\nModel description and formulation\n\nBasic COVID-19 mathematical model\n\nIn formulating the compartmental model describing COVID-19 transmission dynamics, it is assumed that the total population is subgrouped into eight disjoint compartments at any time t. These are susceptible individuals, denoted as S(t), self-quarantined susceptible individuals, represented by Sq(t), exposed (infected but not yet infectious) individuals, denoted as E(t), symptomatic (infectious) individuals, denoted as I(t), asymptomatic individuals, represented by A(t), quarantined individuals, denoted by Q(t), hospitalized individuals, denoted by H(t), and recovered individuals, represented as R(t). Thus, the total population at any time t, denoted as N(t), is given by\n\nN(t)=S(t)+Sq(t)+E(t)+I(t)+A(t)+Q(t)+H(t)+R\n\nwhere N(t) has a variable size due to the consideration of the disease-induced death rate (d≠0).\n\nSubpopulation of susceptible human is increased either by the recruitment of individuals at a rate of Λ or by the fraction εSq of the self-quarantined susceptible individuals, where ε is the rate at which the self-quarantined susceptible individuals become susceptible to COVID-19 infection again. The subpopulation is decreased by the effective contact β(I+ηA+ρH)S, where β is the effective transmission rate of COVID-19 virus from I, A and H classes to S, and η and ρ are the modification parameters accounting for the relative infectiousness of individuals in classes A and H in relation to the individuals in class I. Further, it is decreased by fraction ωS, where ω is the migration rate of the susceptible individuals from class S to class Sq, and by natural death at rate μ. Hence, the rate of change of susceptible human subpopulation is described by the differential equation given as\n\ndSdt=Λ+εSq-β(I+ηA+ρH)S-ωS-μS.\n\nSelf-quarantined susceptible individual subpopulation is generated at the rate of ω and decreased either at the rate of ε or natural death rate μ. Thus, the rate of change of subpopulation of self-quarantined susceptible human is represented as\n\ndSqdt=ωS-εSq-μSq.\n\nAlso, subpopulation of exposed (latently infected) individual is generated through the effective contact rate β(I+ηA+ρH)S. It is decreased by the rate σ of exposed individuals either becoming symptomatic, asymptomatic, or hospitalized infected individuals and by natural death at rate of μ. So, the rate of change of exposed individual subpopulation is given as\n\ndEdt=β(I+ηA+ρH)S-σE-μE.\n\nSubpopulation of symptomatic infectious (delayed diagnosed) individual is generated by rate θ1σE, where θ1 is the fraction of exposed individuals that move to the symptomatic infectious class I. It is decreased by the hospitalized rate αi, recovery rate γi, COVID-19-induced death rate d, and natural death rate μ. Consequently, the rate of change of symptomatic infectious individual subpopulation is expressed as\n\ndIdt=θ1σE-αiI-γiI-dI-μI.\n\nSimilarly, asymptomatic infectious (early diagnosed) individual subpopulation is generated by the rate θ2σE, where θ2 is the fraction of exposed individuals that progress to asymptomatic class A. The subpopulation is either decreased by the recovery rate of γa or by natural death rate μ. Thus, the rate of change of subpopulation of asymptomatic infectious individual is described by\n\ndAdt=θ2σE-γaA-μA.\n\nIn this case, the inflow rate is θ2σ while the outflow rate is γa+μ.\n\nMoreover, quarantined infectious individual subpopulation is generated by the rate θ3σE, where θ3=1-θ1-θ2 is the fraction of exposed individuals that progress to quarantined class Q. It is either decreased by the hospitalized rate αq, by recovery rate of γq, or by natural death rate μ. Therefore, the rate of change of subpopulation of quarantined infected individual is represented as\n\ndQdt=θ3σE-αqQ-γqQ-μQ.\n\nHere, the inflow rate is θ3σ and αq+γq+μ is the outflow rate.\n\nSubpopulation of hospitalized infected individuals is generated by the inflow rate of αiI+αqQ. The subpopulation is decreased by an outflow rate including the recovery rate γh, disease-induced death rate d, and natural death rate μ. It follows that the rate of change of hospitalized infected individual subpopulation is described by the differential equation given as\n\ndHdt=αiI+αqQ-γhH-dH-μH.\n\nFinally, the size of recovered individual subpopulation increases as a result of the recovery of hospitalized, quarantined, symptomatic, and hospitalized infected individuals at rates γi, γa, γq, and γh, respectively.

Table also gives the definitions of the parameters used in model (2).\n\nModel analysis\n\nPositivity and boundedness of solutions\n\nFor COVID-19 model (2) to be epidemiologically meaningful, it is necessary to show that all its state variables are positive for all time. In other words, the solutions of the model with positive initial data will remain positive for all time t>0.\n\nLemma 1\n\nLet the initial data X(0)≥0, where X(t)=(S(t),Sq(t),E(t),I(t),A(t),Q(t),H(t),R(t)). Then, the solutions X(t) of COVID-19 model (2) are positive for all time t>0. In addition,\n\nlimsupN(t)t→∞≤Λμ,\n\nwhere N(t)=S(t)+Sq(t)+E(t)+I(t)+A(t)+Q(t)+H(t)+R(t).\n\nProof\n\nLet t1=supt>0:X(t)>0∈[0,t]. Thus, t1>0. It follows from Eq. (2a) that\n\ndS(t)dt=Λ+εSq(t)-λ(t)S(t)-(ω+μ)S(t).\n\n3\n\nThen, Eq. (3) can be written as\n\nddtS(t)exp∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)t=(Λ+εSq(t))exp∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ε+μ)t.\n\nHence,\n\nS(t1)exp∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)t1-S(0)=∫0t1(Λ+εSq(τ))exp∫0τλ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)τdτ,\n\nso that\n\nS(t1)=S(0)exp-∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)t1+exp-∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)t1∫0t1(Λ+εSq(τ))×exp∫0t1λ(ζ)dζ+(ω+μ)t1dτ,≥0.\n\nThus, S(t1) is positive since it is a sum of positive terms. Similarly, it can be shown that Sq(t)≥0, E(t)≥0, I(t)≥0, A(t)≥0, Q(t)≥0, H(t)≥0, and R(t)≥0.\n\nFor the later part of the proof, note that 0<S(0)≤N(t), 0≤Sq(0)≤N(t), 0≤E(0)≤N(t), 0≤I(0)≤N(t), 0≤A(0)≤N(t), 0≤Q(0)≤N(t), 0≤H(0)≤N(t), 0≤R(0)≤N(t). Adding the components of COVID-19 model (2) gives\n\ndN(t)dt=Λ-μN-d(I+H),≤Λ-μN.\n\nHence,\n\nlimsupN(t)t→∞≤Λμ\n\nas required to be shown. □\n\nInvariant regions\n\nThe analysis of COVID-19 model (2) will be conducted with respect to a biologically feasible region as follows. Let Ω⊂R+8, where Ω is defined by Eq. (4) as\n\nΩ=(S(t),Sq(t),E(t),I(t),A(t),Q(t),H(t),R(t)):N(t)≤Λμ.\n\n4\n\nLemma 2\n\nThe region Ω in Eq. (4) is positively invariant for COVID-19 model (2) with non-negative initial conditions in R+8.\n\nProof\n\nBy summing the equations of COVID-19 model (2), it follows that\n\ndN(t)dt=Λ-μN-d(I+H),≤Λ-μN.\n\nHence, dN(t)dt≤0, if N(0)≥Λμ. Thus, N(t)≤N(0)exp-μt+Λμ1-exp-μt, implying that N(t)→Λμ as t→∞. In particular, N(t)≤Λμ if N(0)≤Λμ. Thus, the region Ω is positively invariant set. Furthermore, if N(0)>Λμ, then either the solutions enter the region Ω in finite time, or N(t) approaches Λμ asymptotically. Hence, the region Ω attracts all the solutions in R+8. □\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to consider COVID-19 transmission dynamics governed by model (2) in the biologically feasible region, Ω, where the model is both mathematically and epidemiologically well posed.\n\nExistence of equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability analysis\n\nThe equilibrium points associated with model (2) are defined such that there is no variations in the state variables S, Sq, E, I, A, Q, H, and R with respect to time, t.\n\nDefinition 1\n\nAn octuple E=S,Sq,E,I,A,Q,H,R∈R8 is said to be an equilibrium point for COVID-19 model (2) if it satisfies\n\nΛ-λS-(ω+μ)S+εSq=0,\n\n5a\n\nωS-(ε+μ)Sq=0,\n\n5b\n\nλS-(σ+μ+ϕ2)E=0,\n\n5c\n\nθ1σE-(αi+γi+d+μ+ϕ4)I=0,\n\n5d\n\nθ2σE-(γa+μ+ϕ3)A=0,\n\n5e\n\nθ3σE-(αq+γq+μ)Q+ϕ2E=0,\n\n5f\n\n(αi+ϕ4)I+ϕ3A+αqQ-(γh+d+μ+ϕ5)H=0,\n\n5g\n\n(γh+ϕ5)H+γqQ+γiI+γaA-μR=0,\n\n5h\n\nwhere λ=β(1-ϕ1)(I+ηA+ρH) and θ3=1-θ1-θ2.\n\nIt is important to note that equilibrium point E is biologically meaningful if and only if E∈Ω. E can be a covid-free equilibrium (CFE) or covid-present equilibrium (CPE) depending on E, I, A, Q, and H. If COVID-19 is not present in the system (i.e. E=I=A=Q=H=0), then E is said to be CFE. Otherwise, if E>0, I>0, A>0, Q>0 or H>0, then E is called CPE.\n\nTo obtain CFE, it requires setting E=I=A=Q=H=R=0 in system (5). Consequently, CFE, denoted as Ef, is obtained as\n\nEf=S∗,Sq∗,0,0,0,0,0,0=Λ(ε+μ)μ(ε+ω+μ),Λωμ(ε+ω+μ),0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\n6\n\nStability of CFE, Ef, can be established by calculating the effective reproduction number, denoted as Rc, using the next generation operator method studied in depth in [39] on COVID-19 model (2). Thus, Rc associated with model (2) is presented by Theorem 1.\n\nTheorem 1\n\nThe effective reproduction number, Rc, of COVID-19 model (2) is given as\n\nRc=(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4g6ηθ2σ+g3g4g5ρθ1σ+g2g3ρθ3σαq+g2g4ρθ2σϕ3+g3g4g6θ1σ+g2g3ραqϕ2)S∗g1g2g3g4g6,\n\n7\n\nRc=(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4g6ηθ2σ+g3g4g5ρθ1σ+g2g3ρθ3σαq+g2g4ρθ2σϕ3+g3g4g6θ1σ+g2g3ραqϕ2)Λ(ε+μ)g1g2g3g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ),\n\n8\n\nwhere g1=σ+μ+ϕ2, g2=αi+γi+d+μ+ϕ4, g3=γa+μ+ϕ3, g4=αq+γq+μ, g5=αi+ϕ4, g6=γh+dμ+ϕ5, and θ3=1-θ1-θ2.\n\nProof\n\nTaking E, I, A, Q and H as the infected compartments and then using the notation in [39], COVID-19 model (2) can be expressed as\n\nddtEIAQHSSqR=λS0000000-(σ+μ+ϕ2)E(αi+γi+d+μ+ϕ4)I-θ1σE(γa+μ+ϕ3)A-θ2σE(αq+γq+μ)Q-θ3σE-ϕ2E(γh+d+μ+ϕ5)H-(αi+ϕ4)I+ϕ3A+αqQλS+(ω+μ)S-Λ-εSq(ε+μ)Sq-ωSμR-γiI-γaA-γqQ-(γh+ϕ5)H.\n\n9\n\nThe next generation matrices are obtained from Eq.

Then, infection matrix F and transition matrix V are the corresponding Jacobian matrices evaluated at Ef and are given as\n\nF=0(1-ϕ1)βΛη(ε+μ)μ(ε+ω+μ)(1-ϕ1)βΛη(ε+μ)μ(ε+ω+μ)0(1-ϕ1)βΛρ(ε+μ)μ(ε+ω+μ)00000000000000000000,V=g10000-θ1σg2000-θ2σ0g300-θ3σ-ϕ200g40-g5-ϕ3-αqg6,\n\nwhere g1=σ+μ+ϕ2, g2=αi+γi+d+μ+ϕ4, g3=γa+μ+ϕ3, g4=αq+γq+μ, g5=αi+ϕ4, g6=γh+d+μ+ϕ5, and θ3=1-θ1-θ2.\n\nTherefore, the effective reproduction number Rc is\n\nRc=ϱFV-1=(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4g6ηθ2σ+g3g4g5ρθ1σ+g2g3ρθ3σαq+g2g4ρθ2σϕ3+g3g4g6θ1σ+g2g3ραqϕ2)S∗g1g2g3g4g6,Rc=(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4g6ηθ2σ+g3g4g5ρθ1σ+g2g3ρθ3σαq+g2g4ρθ2σϕ3+g3g4g6θ1σ+g2g3ραqϕ2)Λ(ε+μ)g1g2g3g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ),\n\nwhere g1=σ+μ+ϕ2, g2=αi+γi+d+μ+ϕ4, g3=γa+μ+ϕ3, g4=αq+γq+μ, g5=αi+ϕ4, g6=γh+d+μ+ϕ5, θ3=1-θ1-θ2, and ϱ is the spectral radius. □\n\nFurthermore, using Theorem 2 in [39], the result in Lemma 3 immediately follows based on the expression Rc.\n\nLemma 3\n\nIf Rc<1, then CFE, Ef, of COVID-19 model (2) is locally asymptotically stable (LAS), and unstable if Rc>1.\n\nRemark 1\n\nFrom the expression Rc in Eq. (8), the basic reproduction number, denoted as R0, for the worst scenario of no control implementation (that is, ϕi=0, i=1,2,..., 5) is obtained as\n\nR0=Rc|ϕi=0,i=1,2,…,5=βσ(ε+μ)(κ2κ4κ5ηθ2+κ3κ4αiρθ1+κ2κ3ρθ3αq+κ3κ4κ5θ1)Λκ1κ2κ3κ4κ5μ(ε+ω+μ),\n\n10\n\nR0=R0I+R0A+R0H,R0=βσ(ε+μ)θ1Λκ1κ2μ(ε+ω+μ)+βσ(ε+μ)ηθ2Λκ1κ3μ(ε+ω+μ)+βσ(ε+μ)ρ(κ4αiθ1+κ2αqθ3)Λκ1κ2κ4κ5μ(ε+ω+μ),\n\n11\n\nwhere κ1=σ+μ, κ2=αi+γi+d+μ, κ3=γa+μ, κ4=αq+γq+μ, κ5=γh+d+μ and θ3=1-θ1-θ2. Consequently, the expression R0 in (10) corresponds to the basic reproduction number of the uncontrolled COVID-19 model (1). The terms R0I, R0A and R0H in Eq. (11) represent the respective average numbers of new COVID-19 infections produced when the symptomatically, asymptomatically, and hospitalized infected individuals are introduced into a completely susceptible population.\n\nNext, we determine the impact of each control measure in reducing COVID-19 disease burden in the population by following a similar idea in [40, 53]. Taking partial derivatives of reproduction number Rc with respect to control parameters ϕi (for i=1,2,…,5) gives\n\n∂Rc∂ϕ1=-β(ηg2g4g6σθ2+g2g3ρσαqθ3+g2g4ρσϕ3θ2+g3g4g5ρσθ1+g2g3ραqϕ2+g3g4g6σθ1)Λ(ε+μ)g1g2g3g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ)<0,∂Rc∂ϕ2=(1-ϕ1)βραqΛ(ε+μ)g1g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ)-(1-ϕ1)β(ηg2g4g6σθ2+g2g3ρσαqθ3+g2g4ρσϕ3θ3+g3g5ρσθ1+g2g3ραqϕ2+g3g4g6σθ1)Λ(ε+μ)g12g2g3g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ)<0,∂Rc∂ϕ3=-(1-ϕ1)β(ηg6-ρ(γa+μ))σθ2Λ(ε+μ)g1g32g6μ(ε+ω+μ)<0,∂Rc∂ϕ4=-(1-ϕ1)β(g6-ρ(γi+d+μ))σθ1Λ(ε+μ)g1g22g6μ(ε+ω+μ)<0,∂Rc∂ϕ5=(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4ησθ2+g3g4σθ1)Λ(ε+μ)g1g2g3g4g6μ(ε+ω+μ)-(1-ϕ1)β(g2g4g6ησθ2+g2g3ρσαqθ3+g2g4ρσθ2ϕ3+g3g4g5ρσθ1+g2g3ραqϕ2+g3g4g6σθ1)Λ(ε+μ)g1g2g3g4g62μ(ε+ω+μ)<0.\n\nIt follows that Rc is a decreasing function of ϕi (where i=1,2,…,5). This shows the effect of the five control measures in reducing the effective reproduction number Rc. It is clear from Eqs. (8) and (10) that the introduction of controls ϕi implies that Rc≤R0 for 0≤ϕi≤1. Thus, if R0<1, then Rc<1.\n\nIt is desirable to examine the solutions of COVID-19 model (2) when the virus is present in the population. Thus, the existence of CPE of COVID-19 model (2) is claimed in Theorem 2.\n\nTheorem 2\n\nIf Rc>1, then COVID-19 model (2) admits a unique (and positive) covid-present equilibrium (CPE) Ep=(S∗∗,Sq∗∗,E∗∗,I∗∗,A∗∗,Q∗∗,H∗∗,R∗∗), where\n\nS∗∗=Λ(ε+μ)μ(ε+μ+ω)Rc,Sq∗∗=Λωμ(ε+μ+ω)Rc,E∗∗=Λ(Rc-1)g1Rc,I∗∗=Λθ1σ(Rc-1)g1g2Rc,A∗∗=Λθ2σ(Rc-1)g1g3Rc,Q∗∗=Λ(θ3σ+ϕ2)(Rc-1)g1g4Rc,H∗∗=ΛA(Rc-1)g1g2g3g4g6Rc,R∗∗=ΛB(Rc-1)g1g2g3g4g6μRc,\n\n12\n\nwith A=g3g4g5θ1σ+g2g4ϕ3θ2σ+g2g3αq(θ3σ+ϕ2), g7=γh+ϕ5, and B=g3g4θ1σ(g5g7+g6γi)+g2g4θ2σ(g7ϕ3+g6γa)+g2g3(θ3σ+ϕ2)(g7αq+g6γq). Otherwise, there is no CPE.\n\nProof\n\nHere, system (5) is solved for the case E>0, I>0, A>0, Q>0, and H>0. Then, the steady solutions S∗∗ and Sq∗∗ are calculated by solving Eqs.

(22). It should be noted from Eq. (22) that λ∗∗=-DC≤0 if D≥0 at Rc≤1, and no CPE exists. Contrarily, λ∗∗=-DC>0 if D<0 at Rc>1. Thus, a CPE exists only at Rc>1. Hence, solving for λ∗∗ in the linear Eq. (22) yields\n\nλ∗∗=μ(ε+μ+ω)(ε+μ)(Rc-1).\n\n23\n\nNow, using the expression λ∗∗ presented by Eq. (23) in Eq. (15) yields\n\nE∗∗=Λ(Rc-1)g1Rc.\n\n24\n\nFinally, substituting the expressions λ∗∗ and E∗∗ in Eqs. (23) and (24), respectively, into Eqs. (13), (14), (16)–(20) accordingly leads to the results defined by Eq. (12). □\n\nGlobal asymptotic stability of the covid-free equilibrium Ef\n\nSince it has been demonstrated that CFE (Ef) and CPE (Ep) of COVID-19 model (2) are the unique equilibria, whose existence strongly depends on the Rc value, from the above discussion, the global asymptotic properties of CFE are explored in this section. To this aim, the idea of direct Lyapunov function used in [5, 41–43] is employed to show that CFE, Ef, is globally asymptotically stable as follows. First, the following positive constant coefficients are defined:\n\na1=g6,a2=(1-ϕ1)βΛ(ε+μ)(g5ρ+g6)g2μ(ε+μ+ω),a3=(1-ϕ1)βΛ(ε+μ)(g6η+ϕ3ρ)g3μ(ε+μ+ω),a4=(1-ϕ1)βΛ(ε+μ)ραqg4μ(ε+μ+ω),a5=(1-ϕ1)βΛ(ε+μ)ρμ(ε+μ+ω).\n\n25\n\nNow, consider the Lyapunov function L given as\n\nL=a1E+a2I+a3A+a4Q+a5H.\n\n26\n\nThe time derivative of L in Eq. (26) is given by\n\ndLdt=a1dEdt+a2dIdt+a3dAdt+a4dQdt+a5dHdt,=a2θ1σ+a3θ2σ+a4(θ3σ+ϕ2)-a1g1E+a1(1-ϕ1)βS+a5g5-a2g2I+a1(1-ϕ1)βηS+a5ϕ3-a3g3A+(a5αq-a4g4)Q+a1(1-ϕ1)βρS-a5g6H.\n\n27\n\nReplacing ai (i=1,…,5) by their respective terms in Eq. (25) and using the fact that S≤S∗=Λ(ε+μ)μ(ε+ω+μ) in the feasible region Ω, we obtain\n\ndLdt≤g1g6(Rc-1).\n\n28\n\nFrom Eq. (28), we have dLdt≤0 if Rc≤1, with dLdt=0 if Rc=1 or E=0. Also, whenever E=0, we have I=0, A=0, Q=0 and H=0. Substituting E=I=A=Q=H=0 in the first, second, and the last equations of COVID-19 model (2) gives\n\nS(t)→S∗,Sq(t)→Sq∗andR(t)→0ast→∞.\n\nThus,\n\nS(t),Sq(t),E(t),I(t),A(t),Q(t),H(t),R(t)→Efast→∞.\n\nConsequently, from LaSalle’s invariance principle [41, 43–45], every solution of COVID-19 model (2) with initial data in Ω converges to CFE, Ef, as t→∞. Therefore, CFE Ef is GAS in Ω if Rc≤1. Thus, we claim the result summarized in Theorem 3.\n\nTheorem 3\n\nIf Rc≤1, then CFE (Ef) of COVID-19 model (2) is GAS in Ω. Otherwise, it is unstable.\n\nParameter estimation and model fitting\n\nThe present section investigates data fitting using the basic model (1) to the confirmed reported COVID-19-infected cases in Malaysia. The available data for daily COVID-19-confirmed cases from 03 March 2020 (when the cases of the disease have continuously been reported per day) till 31 December 2020 reported in Malaysia are considered in this work. The data are obtained from [11] as given in Table . The data include the reported confirmed cases during the second and third waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. The basic model (1) is parameterized using two approaches: Some of the initial conditions and demographic parameters are estimated from the literature. It is assumed that the time unit is days, and the estimation procedure for the initial conditions and parameters is described as follows:\n\n(i) On March 3, there were 7 reported cases (see Table ); a total of 36 had so far been infected with 22 recovered and 14 active cases. So, we set I(0)=7, H(0)=14, and R(0)=22.\n\n(ii) Natural death rate (μ): μ is estimated as μ=175.93 per year, where 75.93 is the average lifespan in Malaysia [46]. Thus, μ=175.93×365 per day.\n\n(iii) The birth or recruitment rate (Λ): Since the total population of Malaysia as at 2019 was 32581.4 (per thousands) [47], it is then assumed that Λμ=32581.4 is the limiting total human population in the absence of the disease, so that Λ=1.17561 per day.\n\nThe remaining biological parameters and the likely values of the other initial conditions are trained with the reported infected cases presented in Table . To do this, we use the nonlinear least square curve fitting technique followed in [7, 40, 48, 49].\n\nTable 5\n\nDayCasesDayCasesDayCasesDayCasesDayCasesDayCasesDayCasesMar 37Mar 414Mar 55Mar 628Mar 710Mar 86Mar 918Mar 1012Mar 1120Mar 129Mar 1339Mar 1441Mar 15190Mar 16125Mar 17120Mar 18117Mar 19110Mar 20130Mar 21153Mar 22123Mar 23212Mar 24106Mar 25172Mar 26235Mar 27130Mar 28159Mar 29150Mar 30156Mar 31140Apr 1142Apr 2208Apr 3217Apr 4150Apr 5179Apr 6131Apr 7170Apr 8156Apr 9109Apr 10118Apr 11184Apr 12153Apr 13134Apr 14170Apr 1585Apr 16110Apr 1769Apr 1854Apr 1984Apr 2036Apr 2157Apr 2250Apr 2371Apr 2488Apr 2551Apr 2638Apr 2740Apr 2831Apr 2994Apr 3057May 169May 2105May 3122May 455May 530May 645May 739May 868May 954May 1067May 1170May 1216May 1337May 1440May 1536May 1617May 1722May 1847May 1937May 2031May 2150May 2278May 2348May 2460May 25172May 26187May 2715May 2810May 29103May 3030May 3157Jun 138Jun 220Jun 393Jun 4277Jun 519Jun 637Jun 719Jun 87Jun 97Jun 102Jun 1131Jun 1233Jun 1343Jun 148Jun 1541Jun 1611Jun 1710Jun 1814Jun 196Jun 2021Jun 2116Jun 2215Jun 233Jun 246Jun 254Jun 266Jun 2710Jun 2818Jun 293Jun 302Jul 11Jul 23Jul 35Jul 410Jul 55Jul 65Jul 76Jul 83Jul 96Jul 1013Jul 118Jul 1214Jul 137Jul 144Jul 155Jul 163Jul 1718Jul 189Jul 1915Jul 2021Jul 2115Jul 2216Jul 239Jul 2421Jul 2523Jul 2613Jul 277Jul 2839Jul 2913Jul 308Jul 3112Aug 19Aug 214Aug 32Aug 41Aug 521Aug 615Aug 725Aug 87Aug 913Aug 1011Aug 119Aug 1211Aug 1315Aug 1420Aug 1526Aug 1625Aug 1712Aug 187Aug 1916Aug 205Aug 219Aug 228Aug 2310Aug 247Aug 2511Aug 266Aug 275Aug 2810Aug 2911Aug 3017Aug 316Sep 114Sep 26Sep 314Sep 411Sep 56Sep 66Sep 762Sep 8100Sep 924Sep 1045Sep 11182Sep 1258Sep 1347Sep 1431Sep 1523Sep 1623Sep 1721Sep 1895Sep 1920Sep 2052Sep 2157Sep 2282Sep 23147Sep 2471Sep 25111Sep 2682Sep 27150Sep 28115Sep 29101Sep 3089Oct 1260Oct 2287Oct 3317Oct 4293Oct 5432Oct 6691Oct 7489Oct 8375Oct 9354Oct 10374Oct 11561Oct 12563Oct 13660Oct 14660Oct 15589Oct 16629Oct 17869Oct 18871Oct 19865Oct 20862Oct 21732Oct 22847Oct 23710Oct 241228Oct 25823Oct 261240Oct 27835Oct 28801Oct 29649Oct 30799Oct 31659Nov 1957Nov 2834Nov 31054Nov 41032Nov 51009Nov 61755Nov 71168Nov 8852Nov 9972Nov 10869Nov 11822Nov 12919Nov 131304Nov 141114Nov 151208Nov 161103Nov 171210Nov 18660Nov 191290Nov 20958Nov 211041Nov 221096Nov 231884Nov 242188Nov 25970Nov 26935Nov 271109Nov 281315Nov 291309Nov 301212Dec 11472Dec 2851Dec 31075Dec 41141Dec 51123Dec 61335Dec 71600Dec 81012Dec 9959Dec 102234Dec 111810Dec 121937Dec 131229Dec 141371Dec 151772Dec 161295Dec 171220Dec 181683Dec 191153Dec 201340Dec 212018Dec 222062Dec 231348Dec 241581Dec 251247Dec 262335Dec 271196Dec 281594Dec 291925Dec 301870Dec 312525\n\nResults of the model fitting\n\nUsing the nonlinear least square curve fitting technique, fitting of model (1) to the daily reported COVID-19-infected cases in Malaysia is investigated. We consider the cumulative cases from the data presented in Table . The model is solved numerically in MATLAB with ode45 solver which is based on the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. In [50], it is well established that this method is stable. So, the model is fit to real data, and the parameters are estimated by implementing the lsqcurvefit package. Figure depicts the best fit to the reported data using model (1). It is observed that there is a good agreement between the model simulation and the real data. Also, Table provides the estimated and fitted parameters values.\n\nTable 2\n\nParameterRangeBaseline value (per day)SourceΛ1.17561Estimatedμ175.93×365[46]β0.1–12.6576×10-5Fittedη0–0.900.7228Fittedρ0–0.900.6526Fittedω0–0.450.3938Fittedε0–0.400.1945Fittedσ0–0.24030.1282Fittedθ10–0.29290.0044Fittedθ20.1–0.39220.0579Fittedθ30–0.990.9377Fittedαi0.1–0.40150.3155Fittedαq0.1–0.23680.0462Fittedd0.01–0.0220.0100Fittedγa0–0.80600.0806Fittedγi0–0.62140.0621Fittedγq0.1–0.49710.0300Fittedγh0.1–0.59670.0400Fitted\n\nState variableRangeBaseline value (per thousands)SourceS00–325003.2499×104FittedSq00–3250070.7018FittedE00–325006.9158×10-4FittedA00–325002.1247FittedQ00–325001.8528Fitted\n\nEstimated R0 value and herd immunity\n\nUsing the model parameter values as given in Table , the estimated value of R0 is approximately R0=2.287. From biological view point, this threshold value indicates that COVID-19 will invade the population if no control effort is implemented to curtail the transmission and spread of the disease.\n\nBased on the calculated R0 value, it is important to determine the fraction of the population that needs to be immunized in order to halt large outbreaks of COVID-19 in Malaysia. When high proportion of a population is immunized against a contagious infectious disease (either via vaccination or recovery from the disease infection), an indirect protection is provided to the proportion that is not immune to the disease. This kind of protection is called herd immunity [55, 62, 63]. Herd immunity plays a key role in epidemic control. For instance, it can be helpful in gaining insightful information about how effective a vaccination administration would be without reaching 100% population coverage.\n\nFollowing [44, 63], the critical level of population immunity, denoted as p^, is calculated with respect to the estimated R0 value for Malaysia COVID-19 outbreaks as\n\np^=1-1R0=0.56,\n\nimplying that if 56% of the population is immune to COVID-19, then the disease will not spread in the population. Hence, successful vaccination of about 56% of the entire population may lead to eradication of the disease in Malaysia.\n\nNumerical simulations and results\n\nUncertainty and global sensitivity analysis\n\nContrary to the local sensitivity analysis of model parameters approach [19, 43, 48], which is most often performed to assess the effect of each parameter included in the response function R0 at a particular point in a parameter space without considering the combined variability owing to the simultaneous consideration of all the input parameters, a global sensitivity analysis is discussed here. This helps to investigate the response of COVID-19 model (1) to parameter variation within a wider range in the parameter space.\n\nFollowing the approach adopted in [5, 7], a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is conducted because of the uncertainties that may come up in the parameter estimates used in the numerical simulations. For the sensitivity analysis, a Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) between the values of the parameters in the response function and those of the response function obtained from the sensitivity analysis is carried out. Using the basic reproduction number R0 as the response function, parameters with the highest PRCC values have the largest impact on R0. Therefore, the key parameters influencing R0 are separated into those that decrease R0 when increased (bars extending to the left for negative PRCC values) and those that cause R0 to increase when increased (bars extending to the right for positive PRCC values). Performing 1000 runs of the LHS, the graphical PRCC results of COVID-19 model (1) relative to the parameters forming R0 are shown in Fig. . Figure observes that the top-ranked sensitive parameter with high positive PRCC value that drives the dynamics of the model transmission is β, followed by Λ, ρ, ε, αq, σ, θ2, η, and θ1. Similarly, the model parameters with competitive most high negative PRCC value are μ, then ω, γh, γq, d, γi, αi, and γa.\n\nIn addition, the sensitivity indices of the model parameters are presented in Table . On the one hand, the positive sign suggests that increasing (or decreasing) any of the model parameter values in this category will lead to a corresponding increase (or decrease) in R0 value. The negative sign, on the other hand, indicates that increasing (or decreasing) each model parameter value in this category will yield a corresponding decrease (or increase) in R0 of the model.\n\nTable 3\n\nParameterSensitivity indexΛ+ veβ+ veη+ veρ+ veω- veε+ veμ- veσ+ veγa- veθ1+ veθ2+ veαi- veαq+ veγi- veγq- veγh- ved- ve\n\nIt is important to identify these key parameters because they can be helpful to the decision makers and the public health practitioners in formulating effective control intervention strategies required to contain the disease spread in the community. Particularly, the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis indicate that a control intervention strategy aims at reducing the model parameters with positive PRCC values (that is, η, ε, β, θ2, ρ, θ1, Λ, αq, and σ) will considerably mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the community. In addition, the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can be effectively curtailed in a community by implementing a control strategy that increases the model parameters having negative PRCC values (that is, ω, γa, d, μ, γh, γi, αi, and αq).\n\nAssessing the effects of control intervention strategies\n\nThis section discusses the numerical simulations of controlled COVID-19 model (2) to assess the impacts of using control interventions ϕ1 (human personal protection including the use of hand-sanitizer, wearing face mask and observing social distancing whenever in public), ϕ2 (efforts of contact tracing and testing on exposed individuals), ϕ3 (treatment of timely diagnosed individuals), ϕ4 (treatment of delayed diagnosed individuals), and ϕ5 (treatment of hospitalized individuals) on the spread of COVID-19 in the population.\n\nEffects of control interventions on the effective reproduction number Rc\n\nAccording to the epidemiological interpretation of Lemma 3 and Theorem 3, COVID-19 will eventually die out in the population when Rc<R0<1, and invades the population whenever R0>Rc>1. Since R0=2.287>1 in the case of no control interventions for COVID-19 outbreaks under investigation, we specifically explore the effects of using two different control intervention strategies simultaneously in putting the effective reproduction number Rc expressed in Eq. (8) below unity. Figure a–c demonstrates the effects of using control strategies which combine controls ϕ1 and ϕ2, ϕ3 and ϕ5, and ϕ4 and ϕ5, respectively.\n\nFigure a shows that the reduction in effective reproduction number Rc below unity is possible by combining about 0.56 (56%) effort each of controls ϕ1 and ϕ2. This suggests that it is possible to eliminate COVID-19 in the population if about 56% of the population comply with personal protection control and about 56% of the exposed individuals that are early diagnosed (through the implementation of control ϕ2) effectively comply with the compulsory quarantine policy per day. Also, it is observed that the simultaneous implementation of about 0.07 (7%) proportion of controls ϕ3 and ϕ5 (Fig. b) effectively impacts Rc to decrease below unity. The result indicates that it is possible to eliminate COVID-19 in the population, if about 7% of the hospitalized individuals get timely treatment support and about 7% of early diagnosed exposed individuals receive treatment support throughout the control implementation period. Figure c shows the effective impact of combining about 0.09 (9%) proportion of controls ϕ4 and ϕ5 by reducing Rc below the acceptable level (Rc<1). This implies that eradication of COVID-19 in the population is possible if about 9% of delayed diagnosed (symptomatic infected) individuals and about 9% of the hospitalized individuals are treated daily over the simulation period.\n\nEffects of different control strategies A–E on COVID-19 population dynamics\n\nHere, we evaluate the effects of using combination of at least two of controls ϕi (i=1,2,…,5) on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the community. For this aim, five different control strategies are defined with consideration of only non-pharmaceutical, only pharmaceutical, and combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures implementation scenarios. The strategies are: Strategy A (non-pharmaceutical measure only; which combines the use of human personal protection, ϕ1, and contact tracing and testing, ϕ2, controls), Strategy B (pharmaceutical measure only; combined efforts of treatment control of timely diagnosed individuals, ϕ3, with treatment control of hospitalized individuals, ϕ5), Strategy C (pharmaceutical measure only; simultaneous implementation of treatment control of delayed diagnosed individuals, ϕ4, and treatment control of hospitalized individuals, ϕ5), Strategy D (pharmaceutical measure only; which combines the treatment control efforts of early diagnosed individuals, ϕ3, treatment control of delayed diagnosed individuals, ϕ4, and treatment control of hospitalized individuals, ϕ5) and Strategy E (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures; combination of personal protection control, ϕ1, contact tracing and testing control, ϕ2, treatment control of early diagnosed individuals, ϕ3, treatment control of delayed diagnosed individuals, ϕ4, and treatment control of hospitalized individuals, ϕ5).\n\nTo illustrate the effect of implementing Strategies A–E, the time series solutions of self-quarantined individual subpopulation (Sq), subpopulation of symptomatic infectious individual (I), the disease prevalence (including the numbers of exposed, E, asymptomatic infected, A, symptomatic infected, I, quarantined, Q, and hospitalized, H, individuals), and recovered individual subpopulation (R) are presented.\n\nStrategy A: combination of use of personal protection (ϕ1) and contact-tracing policy (ϕ2)\n\nFigure shows the dynamics of COVID-19 population with the use of Strategy A and when no control is implemented. It is observed that the number of self-quarantined individuals peak between 1 and 10 days from the beginning of pandemic outbreak and the subpopulation with control is more consistently maintained at the peak value over the remaining simulation period than the subpopulation without control (see Fig. a). Figure b and c reveals that there are three pandemic peaks, where the first one occurs between 250 and 400 days (from March 3, 2020) in the absence of personal protection and contact-tracing and testing policy controls implementation, the second occurs after 350 days (by February 2021) when 20% of the entire population observe personal protection control measure and 20% of the detected exposed individuals comply with compulsory self-quarantine policy while the third occurring after 600 days (by October 2021) when 40% of the population comply with personal protection regulation and 40% of the exposed individuals that are detected comply with compulsory self-quarantine policy. The peak vanishes when 60% of the population make use of personal prevention measure and 60% of the detected exposed individuals comply with self-quarantine policy. The number of symptomatic infectious individuals and the size of the disease prevalence in the population diminish more rapidly and quickly with control strategy than when there is no control (as shown in Fig. b and c), leading to fewer number of individuals recovering from COVID-19 infection (as shown in Fig. d).\n\nThis control strategy reveals that, if about 60% of the population comply with the personal protection control policy (such as the use of hand sanitizer, observing social distancing and effective wearing of face mask in public), at least 60% of the exposed individuals that are detected comply with the compulsory quarantine policy, and with strict enforcement of self-quarantine (lockdown) on the entire population, then it is possible to eliminate the pandemic in the community.\n\nStrategy B: combination of use of treatment of timely diagnosed individuals (ϕ3) and treatment of hospitalized individuals (ϕ5)\n\nIn Fig. , the effect of implementing Strategy B on the dynamics of COVID-19 population is illustrated. Figure a indicates that the self-quarantined subpopulation peaks between 1 and 10 days (counting from March 3, 2020), and the subpopulation with control is consistently sustained at the peak value throughout the remaining intervention period. It can be seen that COVID-19 incidence and prevalence diminish when timely treatment is administered on about 20% of early diagnosed individuals and about 20% of hospitalized individuals per day (see Fig. b and c). Further, the use of this strategy causes fewer number of individuals to recover from COVID-19 infection as shown in Fig. d. Hence, the results obtained from implementing this control strategy suggest that it is possible to flatten COVID-19 pandemic curve if about 20% of early diagnosed individuals and about 20% of hospitalized individuals receive treatment support per day, with strictly enforced self-quarantined (lockdown) on the entire population.\n\nStrategy C: combination of use of treatment of delayed diagnosed individuals (ϕ4) and treatment of hospitalized individuals (ϕ5)\n\nFigure depicts the effect of combining treatment controls of delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals (Strategy C) on the dynamics of COVID-19 population. It is observed that the number of self-quarantined individual is peaked between 1 and 10 days from the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, and the number with control is more continuously maintained at the peak value over the remaining intervention period as shown in Fig. a. Figure b and c depicts that the use of about 20% each of controls ϕ4 and ϕ5 diminishes the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in the population. In addition, the number of recovered individuals is significantly reduced with an increased combined efforts of control implementation as observed in Fig. d. Hence, this strategy indicates that it is possible to eradicate COVID-19 in the population, if about 20% of both the delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals in the population get treated per day and self-quarantine policy is strictly enforced on the entire population.\n\nStrategy D: combination of use of treatment of timely diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals (ϕ3, ϕ4 and ϕ5)\n\nFigure demonstrates the effect of the use of Strategy D (combined efforts of controls ϕ3, ϕ4 and ϕ5) on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the population. It is seen that using about 20% of each control, the number of self-quarantined is consistently sustained at the peak value for almost the entire intervention period when compared with the case of no control implementation (see Fig. a). Also, Fig. b and c shows one pandemic peak occurring between 250 and 400 days (counting from March 3, 2020) when no pharmaceutical measures are implemented. However, this pandemic peak disappears over the simulation period by implementing about 20% each of the treatment controls of timely diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals on a daily basis. Consequently, a high number of infections are averted with control implementation as the size of recovered individual sub-population significantly decreases when compared with the worst scenario of no control implementation in the population as observed in Fig. d. Therefore, the use of Strategy D suggests that if self-quarantine policy is strictly enforced on the entire population with about 20% each of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, and hospitalized individuals given timely treatment per day, then it is possible to eliminate COVID-19 in the population in the long run.\n\nStrategy E: combination of use of personal protection (ϕ1), contact-tracing policy (ϕ2), and treatment of timely diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals (ϕ3, ϕ4 and ϕ5)\n\nThe dynamics of COVID-19 population with and without the implementation of control Strategy E is illustrated in Fig. . Figure a shows that with the use of about 20% each of controls ϕi (i=1,2,…,5), the size of self-quarantined subpopulation is consistently maintained at the peak value after about 10th day till the end of intervention period. Also, the peaks of symptomatic infectious individual sub-population and the disease prevalence occurring between 250 and 400 days (counting from March 3, 2020) in the case of no control implementation disappeared from the onset of control implementation till the end of control implementation period by using 20% of each control (as shown in Fig. b and c) leading to no individuals recovering from COVID-19 infections in the population (see Fig. d). It therefore follows from the implementation of this control strategy that elimination of COVID-19 in the population is possible if the self-quarantined policy (lockdown) is strictly enforced on the whole population with about 20% of the population complying with personal protection control policy, about 20% of the detected exposed individuals obeying the compulsory quarantine policy, about 20% of the early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, and hospitalized individuals receiving medical treatment per day.\n\nEffectiveness analysis\n\nGraphical solutions illustrated in Figs. , , , show that implementations of Strategies B–E have similar impacts on the dynamics of COVID-19-infected subpopulations and the disease prevalence. Thus, it is necessary to compare the efficacy of control intervention strategies A–E in reducing COVID-19 prevalence in the population by performing effectiveness analysis in the current section. This helps us in our decision making on the best control intervention strategy. Following [51–53], we compare the efficacy of the five strategies under investigation in reducing COVID-19 prevalence (including exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, quarantined, and hospitalized individuals) in the population. To this aim, effectiveness index is defined as [51–53]:\n\nCi=1-CsCo×100%\n\n29\n\nwhere Cs=∫0T(E+A+I+Q+H)dt and Co=∫0T(E+A+I+Q+H)dt measure the cumulative number of infected individuals (COVID-19 prevalence) in the time interval t∈[0,T], T=1400 days, with and without any control intervention, respectively. Thus, the best control strategy will be the one with the biggest Ci value [51, 53].\n\nUsing the simulation results for control strategies A–E (as shown in Figs. , , , , ) and fixing controls ϕi (i=1,2,…,5) at 0.60(60%) since the disease spread is significantly curtailed at this level of control implementation for each control strategy, the results of effectiveness index are summarized in Table .\n\nTable 4\n\nControl strategyCsCi(%)No control8.96227×1050Strategy A(ϕ1,ϕ2)1.30408×10399.85449Strategy C(ϕ4,ϕ5)2.81098×10299.96864Strategy B(ϕ3,ϕ5)1.02212×10299.98860Strategy D(ϕ3,ϕ4,ϕ5)1.01919×10299.98862Strategy E(ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, ϕ4, ϕ5)5.10150×10199.99431\n\nTable shows that Strategy E (which combines personal protection, contact tracing and testing of exposed individuals, treatment of early diagnosed individuals, treatment of delayed diagnosed individuals, and treatment of hospitalized individuals control efforts) is the most effective, followed by Strategy D (which combines treatment controls of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, and hospitalized individuals), Strategy B (combination of treatment controls of early diagnosed and hospitalized individuals), Strategy C (which combines the efforts of treatment control of delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals), then Strategy A (combination of personal protection and contact tracing and testing of exposed individuals controls). In other words, the control strategy that averts the highest number of infections in the population is Strategy E. Strategy D is the next strategy that averts the highest number of COVID-19 infections, followed by Strategies B and C, while Strategy A averts the least number of infections in the population.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work, we consider the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 3 March 2020 (the first day from when the disease started to be reported continuously on daily basis) to 31 December 2020 in Malaysia. Since it has been demonstrated that deterministic models fit well to cumulative COVID-19-infected cases in several previous studies [5, 7, 48], the parameters of the autonomous system (1) are fitted using the cumulative version of the data set given in Table . Using the fitted parameter values along with the initial values in Table , the projection of the number of infected individuals (I), recovered individuals (R), and the disease prevalence (including the exposed individuals E, symptomatic infectious individuals, I, asymptomatic infectious individuals, A, quarantined individuals, Q, and hospitalized individuals, H) in Figs. , , , , reveals that it may take about 600 days (counting from 3 March 2020) before the number of COVID-19-confirmed cases diminishes, while it takes about 650 days (from 3 March 2020) before the disease infection could be cleared in the population after all the patients having recovered from infection in the case of no control implementation. Also, the estimated basic reproduction number R0 value is approximately R0=2.287. This threshold value is an epidemiological indicator that COVID-19 will persist in the population when no control effort is implemented. Hence, it is desirable to investigate a control strategy that puts R0 below one.\n\nTo this aim, five control parameters accounting for personal protection (such as the use of hand sanitizer, effective wearing of face mask whenever in public, observing social distancing), contact tracing and testing to quarantine the latently infected (exposed) individuals, and treatment controls of the timely diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals are introduced into the model. First, we use the corresponding effective reproduction number Rc as a response function to examine the impact of different control strategies involving the use of exactly two control measures with no consideration for combining a pharmaceutical control measure (either treatment of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, or hospitalized individuals) with any non-pharmaceutical control measures (human personal protection or case detection through contact tracing and testing). Figure shows that Strategies A (use of non-pharmaceutical control measures only), B (use of pharmaceutical controls; treatment controls of early diagnosed and hospitalized individuals only) and C (use of pharmaceutical controls; treatment controls of delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals) are all sufficient to put Rc below unity within the bound imposed on the control parameters (i.e. ϕi∈[0,1],i=1,2,…,5). However, least combined effort of controls (about 0.07 of each control) is needed in lowering Rc below unity using Strategy B, while the use of Strategies C and A requires more and most combined effort of controls involved (about 0.09 and 0.58, respectively) in reducing Rc below the acceptable level for disease elimination in the community. The observed significant impact of applying non-pharmaceutical control measures on Rc agrees with the results in [5], which revealed that the implementation of combined efforts of face mask and social distancing control measures is enough to bring Rc below one in the long run.\n\nMoreover, we investigate the effects of Strategies A–E on the dynamics of COVID-19 population. We observed that the number of symptomatic infectious individuals as well as the disease prevalence can be reduced considerably in the population using any of the five control strategies (see Figs. , , , , ). It is possible to flatten the epidemic curve using about 0.20 (20%) combined control effort involved in Strategies B–E per day, while a covid-free population can be achieved using Strategy A by stepping up the combined effort of controls to 0.60 (60%) per day over the simulation period. It is shown that a positive attitude of the entire population toward self-isolation may enhance the efficacy of the implemented personal protection, contact tracing and testing on exposed individuals, and treatment control measures using any of Strategies A–E analysed in this work (see Figs. a, a, a, a and a). The effect of the six control strategies is analysed at 0% to 60% levels of implementations because it is more realistic to admit the possibility of the public compliance with human personal protection and the use of other practical control measures (treatment and contact tracing and testing) at these levels than their higher levels of implementations (i.e. 61%–100%).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis work has formulated and analysed an appropriate mathematical model which involves an autonomous system of ODEs governing the dynamics of COVID-19 population in Malaysia. The model is used to evaluate the impact of different control strategies for the use of pharmaceutical control measures (particularly, treatment of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (human personal protection, such as the use of hand-sanitizer, social distancing policy and wearing of face mask, and case detection through contact tracing ad testing on the exposed individuals) on the disease spread dynamics.\n\nQualitative analysis of the model reveals that the model has a CFE, which is LAS whenever Rc<1 and GAS if Rc≤1. It is also shown that the model admits a unique CPE if Rc>1, and no CPE otherwise.\n\nSensitivity analysis of the model parameters reveals that the transmission probability of the virus (β), progression rate of susceptible individuals to self-quarantined compartment (ω), the rate of self-quarantined individuals to become susceptible to COVID-19 virus again (ε), human recruitment rate (Λ), modification parameter representing the relative infectiousness of hospitalized individuals (ρ), progression rate of quarantined individuals to hospitalized compartment (αq), human natural death rate (μ), COVID-19 induced death rate (d), recovery rate of hospitalized individuals (γh), and recovery rate of quarantined individuals (γq) among other parameters are the dominant parameters influencing the basic reproduction number R0.\n\nBy performing numerical simulations of the model, the effects of using control Strategies A–E (where Strategy A is the combination of personal protection and contact tracing and testing control measures, Strategy B is the simultaneous administration of treatment control on early diagnosed and hospitalized infected individuals, Strategy C is the combined efforts of treatment controls administered on the delayed diagnosed and hospitalized infected individuals, Strategy D combines the treatment controls of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed, and hospitalized infected individuals, while Strategy E is the combination of personal protection, contact tracing and testing on exposed individuals, and treatment controls of early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals) on the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in the community are analysed. It is found that using Strategy A (non-pharmaceutical control measures only), COVID-19 will eventually die out in the population if at least 60% of the population comply with personal protection policy such as effective use of face mask while in public, observing social distancing, regular use of hand sanitizer among others with about 60% of detected exposed individuals comply with the compulsory quarantine policy. Also, it is possible to eliminate the disease in the population when only pharmaceutical measures are implemented, if about 20% of early diagnosed individuals is given timely treatment with at least 20% of the hospitalized individuals being provided with timely treatment (Strategy B), if at least 20% of the delayed diagnosed individuals receives timely treatment and timely treatment is administered on about 20% of the hospitalized individuals (Strategy C), or if about 20% of early diagnosed individuals is given timely treatment with at least 20% of each of the delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals given timely treatment. However, it is most effective to eliminate the disease in the population using combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures (Strategy E), if about 20% of the population comply with personal protection regulation with about 20% of the detected exposed individuals comply with quarantine policy, and early treatment is administered on at least 20% of each early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized individuals.\n\nTherefore, this work suggests combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures including strict enforcement of personal protection (such as the use of hand sanitizer, social distancing compliance and use of face mask among others), population screening and testing to detect new cases, provision of a timely treatment support for the early diagnosed, delayed diagnosed and hospitalized infected individuals along with lockdown imposed on the population as a strict measure to be taken by Malaysian authority and policy makers to effectively curtail COVID-19 spread in the country.\n\nThe present model is formulated to incorporate five control parameters to analyse the effect of different strategies for their implementation on the dynamics of COVID-19 population. However, further studies may take into consideration the development of non-autonomous version of the model to derive the optimal control profiles that are required for each strategy to effectively minimize the spread of COVID-19 population in Malaysia using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Also, cost-effectiveness analysis may be performed to derive the cost-benefits associated with control strategy implementations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to the editor and anonymous reviewers.
