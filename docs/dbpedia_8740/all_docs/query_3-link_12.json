        "text": "Get around\n\n[edit]\n\nIf traveling around Lagos, be sure to be accompanied by a tourist guide who is familiar with the routes. In Lagos, there are street signs on every single street corner making it easy to locate places and landmarks. With the city spending huge budgets on security, there has been a huge reduction in crime generally. For the most part, it's safe to move about during the day. If you are going out at night, be sure to go in groups, and stick to known routes.\n\nIf you are not on a tight budget, you should hire a car and driver, usually available from most of the major hotels and the airport. The price will be around ₦1,000-2,000 per hour, you will be expected to haggle. Talk to the drivers and find one you think will be able to communicate best with as they will be able to tell you things about the places you pass.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nLagos's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines run in segregated lanes and thus run faster than private cars stuck in traffic. The buses are coloured red or blue.\n\nThe BRT is one of the three-pronged attacks the state has unleashed against the urban traffic congestion in Lagos. Buses can be an inexpensive and convenient option. Bus fares are relatively affordable and there are numerous routes being plied from the Mainland to the Islands.\n\nThe tickets for the BRT and the Lagbus can be purchased at the bus stops before boarding. Tickets range from ₦100-250 (2016). However, the ticket vendors are seldom available in the evening even though the buses ply till late at night. It makes good sense to purchase a ticket booklet or a couple of tickets in bulk beforehand since these don't contain a timestamp.\n\nThere are also smaller yellow buses (Danfo) that ply all routes from the mainland to the island and within mainland. For a newbie, the yellow bus system can be quite confusing and it makes good sense to approach a local for help. The local Nigerians will be more than happy to help an Oyinbo (white person). The fare is fixed and starts from ₦50 and increases by distance.\n\nThe BRT buses are faster, cleaner and more convenient. They carry hundreds of thousands of passengers on a weekly basis.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nThe road network of Lagos for the most part is good, but sometimes traffic congestion and limited parking space especially during working hours is rife. Be sure to be on the lookout for road signs, in order to avoid entering one-way roads or streets. LASTMA (Lagos State Traffic Management Agency) is the body responsible for managing traffic in most of the traffic congestion areas. Make sure to follow traffic rules, and avoid driving in the BRT Bus lanes to avoid getting a fine or having your car impounded.\n\nThere exists car parks around in hotels, shopping malls, and some of them provide free and safe parking. But if parking in other areas around the city be ready to pay around ₦200 or more.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the easiest ways to get around is by taxi. Taxis cost more than buses, typically. With the older taxi cabs it is expected to negotiate the price before you enter and pay on arrival. The cabs are relatively safe. The state has embarked on gradual replacement of rickety buses and taxi cabs with modern ones, fitted with good facilities to enhance comfort.\n\nThrough public-private partnerships, new cabs are being introduced regularly by licensed cab operators.\n\nWith fares as low as ₦500, depending on the distance, the new air-conditioned taxi cabs are already creating a new image for Lagos. Taxis can be found almost everywhere, and all the new cabs have numbers on them that you can call for a pick up. There are several cab companies servicing Lagos, using both metered and fixed fares,and they generally accept cash:\n\nUber — Retail unit no. 5. Second upper floor, Maryland Mall, 350/360 Ikorodu Road\n\nTaxify — 9 Professor Gabriel Olusanya St, Lekki Phase 1\n\nBy rented car\n\n[edit]\n\nRenting a car is another alternative if you are going to be staying for a few days or longer. There are numerous car rental offices in the city, and therefore it is very easy to rent a car from your hotel or resort accommodation to drive around with for the duration of your stay. Avis is your best bet for this; either call or make use of their online services:\n\nBy ferry\n\n[edit]\n\nLagos Ferry Services Company runs scheduled routes between Lagos Island, Banana island, Mile 2 (Apapa axis) and the mainland. Modern ferries have been assigned to carry both passengers and cargo on the lagoon and on some creeks. The service charge is quite affordable for a tourist.\n\nBy rail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first section of the long-awaited Lagos Rail Mass Transit opened in September 2023, connecting the Mainland to Marina on Lagos Island and cutting travel time for the 13-km journey to just 15 minutes. The fare for the trip is N375, payable only by Cowry Card.\n\nThere are ambitious expansion plans, including a line to the airport, but progress has been slow.\n\nMotorbikes\n\n[edit]\n\nFor travelling short distances, you can use motorbike taxis called Okada. These motorbikes are quick, cheap and save a lot of walking but they are also very dangerous. Okada accidents are very common but safety equipment are now provided because the state government and in fact the Federal Road Safety Commission has mandated it. If you want to take the risk, you can safely halve their first price, and usually there are lots to choose from. Before you try and negotiate, confirm the fare from a local. If you have a Nigerian friend, let them negotiate for you as the quoted fare differs greatly for locals and foreigners (for obvious reasons). Choose an older driver as the younger ones are cowboys.\n\nSafety Helmets are a must at all times for both the rider and passenger. Majority of times these are ill-fitting and sometimes even absent.\n\nBy law, Okadas are forbidden to ply after dark (7PM) for safety reasons. Avoid taking an Okada for long distances, while it's raining and in the night since majority of mainland is devoid of street lights.\n\nOkadas and kekes (tuk tuks) were banned by the government in Lagos/Victoria Islands, Ikeja, Apapa, Yaba, and certain other Mainland districts of Lagos effective Feb of 2020 for safety reasons.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nUnless you are in a supermarket or restaurant/bar with fixed prices, you will be expected to negotiate the price you pay for an item down to the lowest the vendor would sell. When you are stuck in traffic, expect to see hawkers selling anything from potatoes to drinks. Expect any brand names in these informal markets to be fake, and should you wish to purchase them aim for a very low price.\n\nIf you hold a Visa, MasterCard or Maestro credit/debit card you can withdraw cash in Naira from various ATMs around Lagos. Visa machines can be found at Standard Chartered Bank. MasterCard/Maestro machines are found in Ecobank and some Zenith Bank branches.\n\nForeign currency, U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, or euros can be exchanged in various places, usually near large hotels and the airport. These are not formal bureaux de change and you will need to negotiate the exchange rate. It is strongly recommended that you count your money in front of the exchanger, and don't be afraid to walk away if you are not happy with the deal. Be wary of your safety in money changing areas, and take care to make sure you are not followed when leaving them.\n\nThere are formal bureaux de change in the various banks, and you can rest assured about transacting with them, although their rates may be slightly higher or lower than the rates outside.\n\nSome of the good places for shopping are the City Mall and the Lekki Art Market.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nIn general, Lagos has become a much safer place to visit than before, with the state spending huge budgets on security with police patrol cars, CCTV cameras (though this isn't always the case). etc. But beware of deals or businesses that sound too good to be true (especially e-mails soliciting your help), and do not openly flaunt your possessions, especially in public places.\n\nWhile it is rare for a tourist to be a victim of a violent crime, it is still wise to stay safe and be alert, especially during late night outings. Stick to crowded streets and make sure to go out in groups as against going out alone.\n\nLagosians are generally nice and friendly people, most of whom will readily offer directions to you if you are lost.\n\nLagos still has its fair share of street beggars (both the old and young), people with psychological disorders, etc. If someone approaches Lagosians for money, what most of them do is ignore the person or continue to walk at a brisk pace.\n\nThere are police officers who are corrupt and inefficient so it is best that you stick to places and people you know and avoid going anywhere without a trusted guide if it is a first visit.\n\nConnect\n\n[edit]\n\nNigeria has both GSM & CDMA Networks. Most of the International GSM Networks are served here on Roaming Partner Basis. Local pre-activated GSM (SIM) connection can be purchased at a very cheap rate. ₦200 for a SIM.\n\nGSM/3G/ 4G\n\n9Mobile Services: Calls, SMS, GPRS and some most advanced feature can be found only on this network.\n\nAirtel: (formerly Zain or CelTel). Services: Calls, SMS & GPRS Services.\n\nMTN: Services: Calls, SMS, DATA (Internet) & GPRS Services.\n\nGlo: Services: Calls, SMS, DATA (Internet) & GPRS Services.\n\n4G/LTE\n\nSWIFT: Services: Calls, SMS & DATA (Internet).\n\nSpectranet: Services: Calls, SMS & DATA (Internet).\n\nSMILE: Services: Calls, SMS & DATA (Internet).\n\nCyberspace Networks: Services: Calls, SMS & DATA (Internet).\n\nVodafone: Services: DATA (Internet).\n\nExpress Wifi: Services: DATA (Internet).\n\nWifi.com.ng: Services: DATA (Internet).\n\nWifi Internet providers\n\nExpress Wifi: Services: Calls, SMS & DATA (Internet).\n\nRetail unit no. 5. Second upper floor, Maryland Mall, 350/360 Ikorodu Road\n\nIn Nigeria SMS (Short Messaging Service) is known as \"Text\".\n\nThe networks in some parts of Lagos can be very erratic at times. On certain days you cannot make a phone call at all or you will not be able to recharge your phone for the most of the day making business very difficult at times. But its occasional and that is the reason if you want to stay for a long term, make sure that you have at least two phones or a dual SIM phone."
