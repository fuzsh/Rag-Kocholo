It also helped senior officials from Nigeria’s government, judiciary and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission build skills to prevent, investigate and prosecute corruption.\n\nThe Secretariat provided Nigeria with policy advice on public finance and managing risks. As a result, the government made progress in transparency, fairness and value for money when buying goods and services.\n\nTackling corruption\n\nTrade\n\nIn 2017, the Secretariat provided Nigeria with a report on the possible impact of the UK leaving the European Union on trade between the two countries. The government was therefore able to prepare for potential economic disruption.\n\nTrade work\n\nNatural resources\n\nThe Secretariat advised Nigeria’s mining sector on contracts and the international rules that govern seabed mining. It also helped the government to prepare to negotiate with the International Seabed Authority (ISA).\n\nNatural resources work\n\nBlue Charter\n\nNigeria is a member of the Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance and Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods Action Groups.\n\nBlue Charter\n\nConnectivity Agenda\n\nNigeria is a member of the Physical and Digital Connectivity clusters of the Commonwealth Connectivity Agenda. The Connectivity Agenda is a platform for countries to exchange best practices and experiences to trade and investment and undertake domestic reform.\n\nConnectivity Agenda\n\nFind out more"
