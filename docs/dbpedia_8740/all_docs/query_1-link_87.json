        "text": "Migration has continued to attract the interest of scholars and critics of Nigerian literature, especially as Nigerian migrants are constantly victims of xenophobia. The migrants, particularly the women, are grossly objectified and insufferably abused, both nationally and internationally. There have been spates of incarcerations, killings and deportation of migrant women in different parts of the world: Italy, Malaysia, Libya, to mention but a few. There have also been records of deaths and harrowing experiences of female migrants in the Mediterranean Seas and the Sahara Desert. It is against this backdrop that this study adopts Post-colonial Feminism to analyse the motivations and experiences of the female migrant characters as post-colonial subjects in the Diaspora. Female characters from Chika Unigwe's On Black Sisters' Street and Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo's Trafficked are studied in order to ascertain the extent to which the cultural environment, legacies of colonialism and neocolonialism interplay to influence the decisions taken by these women. It is discovered that the woefully pathetic plight of migrant Nigerian women is a product of a disordered psyche induced by the socio-political, economic and cultural realities prevalent in postcolonial Nigeria. This study recommends that women empowerment and sustainable developmental policy implementation can help to curtail the psycho-emotional realities that are capable of misleading young Nigerian women.\n\nThis interview with Nigerian writer Chika Unigwe addresses the ethics and aesthetics of representing sex trafficking and transnational migration in her award-winning novel On Black Sisters’ Street (2009) and her latest short story collection Better Never Than Late (2019). The author discusses the discourse on migration and trafficking in both works, bringing much-needed nuance to the conversation. She pays particular attention to issues of “agency” and “vulnerability,” as well as authenticity, stereotyping, the “white gaze,” the publishing industry, and the recent controversy on Jeanine Cummin’s American Dirt (2020). Drawing from her own personal story, Unigwe also talks in depth about the stylistic choices she made in depicting the immigrant experience in the global north and the difficulty of representing rape and trauma in fiction.\n\nJust like social occurrences such as human sacrifice and slavery enhanced retardation of progress in Africa in the past, trafficking is another social occurrence addressed in contemporary African literature that impedes progress and tarnishes the image of the victims. Human trafficking is rampant in Africans and some part of the world in this 21st century. This paper examines how Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo’s Trafficked (2008) and Chika Unigwe’s On Black Sisters′ Street (2009) highlight social occurrences and how they contribute to the spread of girl trafficking in Africa. It also explores how both men and women are partners in trafficking, forming trafficking networks that lure girls from Nigeria to Europe and make huge profits from their misery. These pimps use ‘juju magic’ and rituals as a threat to exert complete control over the girls and also to ensure their compliance. The trafficked girls share their life experiences by telling their tales of woes exposing the shame that accompan...\n\nIn 2020, the government of Uganda reported investigating 214 incidents of human trafficking involving 154 suspects; of these incidents, 118 were internal, 93 transnationals, and three unknowns. This was a decrease compared with investigating 252 incidents (19 internal and 222 transnational) in 2019. This article examines how human trafficking and exploitation impacts on young girls from developing countries using Akachi Dimora Ezeig’s novel; ‘Trafficked’ and Apio Eunice Otuku’s ‘Zura Maids’. Using content analysis, the study engages critical discourse of postcolonial tenets understand the creation of inferiority complex, identity crisis, and cultural erosion among the colonized. As a result of social justice principle of “otherness”, which is a binary opposition between “I/We” and “Them”, the study packages the problem neatly, but offers few solutions for Africa, whilst condemning human trafficking and exploitation as a heinous act on humanity.\n\nSexual exploitation of the girl-child for commercial purposes is both a domestic and international problem. Human trafficking and sex slavery require serious attention because they affect the physical and mental health of their victims. This paper explores the psychological impacts of sex slavery and human trafficking on the “girl-child” in Akachi Adimorah-Ezeigbo&#39;s Trafficked. The selected novel clearly depicts the after-effects and negative consequences of trafficking and sexual exploitation. This research aims at exposing and creating awareness on the consequences of human trafficking and sex slavery on the girl-child as modern forms of slavery. In order to achieve this, the researcher employs the Trauma theory to depict the pain and agony associated with trafficking and forced sexual activities. However, it is discovered that both domestic and international trafficking of girls for commercial sex works have psychological or emotional implications which impinge on their growt...\n\nThis paper advocates that a reading of Chika Unigwe's On Black Sisters' Street must expressly engage the writer's ambivalence about migration for sex work. The reading approaches OBSS from an angle which concedes the tensions in Unigwe's depiction of her female characters' lives between constraint and comfort, violence and possibility. This (re)negotiates the mobile spaces and affective labours of interpretation, sometimes facing obstacles, and at others managing to clear a provisional passage towards ideas that are present in the text, but with less obviousness than others. The discussion notes elements of intersecting identity for the writer and her female protagonists as black immigrants in a predominantly white European space (Belgium), positions which constantly enjoin them to (re)negotiate their respective roles as migrant African women. Acknowledging abuses against her black female sex worker characters while at the same time giving them an emphatic sense of worth, Unigwe humanizes her female protagonists, inviting readers to respond to the women's moving circumstances, rather than prejudge them according to their profession. The novel 'produces vexed implications' instead of being able to be 'read as rigidly determinate' (Omelsky 94). Unigwe undercuts the limitation of telling a 'single story' about African female migrants who are sex workers in Antwerp, imagining the complicated delineations of their subjection and agency.\n\nThis article analyses Chika Unigwe's novel On Black Sisters' Street as a sociopolitical narrative by examining the issue of sex trafficking and the subsequent violation of women's fundamental human rights. First, I will argue that gender is the primary cause of inequality to which African women are exposed, within and outside the continent. The novel's characters are indeed both victims and accomplices of the corrupt patriarchal capitalist system; they are subject to social constraints but also active agents capable of resisting the restrictions imposed on them. Second, I will draw on Sara Ahmed's thesis about the circulation of emotions to discuss how pain, disgust, anger, and hatred 'work' in modern global society and determine the affective dimensions of sex trafficking. I will demonstrate, therefore, how these emotions highlight the power dynamics of patriarchy and capitalism and simultaneously give voice to women's political and ethical demands for reparation and redress.\n\nGender as an important resonance in the transnational dynamics of globalisation significantly compels African women to transgress orthodox boundaries and traditional spaces which often limit them to domestic spheres. Particularly in the global south, for instance, the gendered forces of globalisation, complexly restructures people and spaces such that African women’s identities and sexualities are profoundly altered. How then do female African writers represent this highly sexualised phenomenon in their artistic productions? This essay examines the specificities of the gendered forces of globalisation from the perspectives of two contemporaneous female West African writers—Amma Darko and Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo in their novels Beyond the Horizon and Trafficked. The route of this literary study is a trajectory that attempts to reveal some of the emerging patterns of globalisation especially on African women’s bodies. The essay also demonstrates, among other things, how the sexualities..."
