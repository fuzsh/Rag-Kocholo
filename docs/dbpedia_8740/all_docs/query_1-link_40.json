        "text": "The wife of an Anglican bishop could expect a life of peace and comfort. But Benjamin Kwashi is the bishop of Jos in Nigeria, a place that is torn by Muslim-Christian violence. Gloria Kwashi has had her home burnt down and has endured rape and beatings. One of the beatings left her blinded, until surgery was able to restore her sight. Despite this, she continues to reach out to widows and orphans and supports her husband in his remarkable ministry in Northern Nigeria. This book is a record of love and endurance that should stimulate us to examine our own lives and how we respond to adversity.\n\nGloria Kwashi is one of my heroines. My personal name for her is “Gloria in Excelsis”!\n\n— CAROLINE (BARONESS) COX\n\nGloria Kwashi has been repeatedly tried by fire, even passing through the valley of the shadow of death, yet emerging each time with a deepened faith in God and an enlarged heart to serve humanity. Indomitable and unstoppable, yet gentle, she is the ultimate role model, my sister, counsellor, friend and mentor rolled into one.\n\n— DR. KHATAZA GONDWE, CHRISTIAN SOLIDARITY WORLDWIDE"
