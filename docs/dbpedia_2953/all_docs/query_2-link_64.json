        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nThe economics of movie ticket pricing in India and what industry experts say about uniform costs - #BigStory\n\nThis story is from February 4, 2023\n\nThe economics of movie ticket pricing in India and what industry experts say about uniform costs - #BigStory\n\nEarlier last month, the Supreme Court ruled that it is unfair to direct uniform pricing of cinema tickets regardless of location and facilities of theatre. The inflation in the cost of movie tickets and food and beverage (FnB) sold at the cinema outlets has been a topic of discussion for a while. Even Jackie Shroff had recently raised concerns when UP CM Yogi Adityanath met Bollywood celebs in Mumbai. He suggested the prices of popcorn in cinemas be lowered to get more people to flock to theatres.\n\nWhile the mandate for the uniform pricing of cinema tickets has been ruled out, the debate still stands on whether lowering ticket costs can increase footfalls in theatres. In todayâs #BigStory, we speak to film distributors, exhibitors, trade experts, and filmmakers and find out how the prices are decided, inflation in ticket costs, is uniform pricing necessary, regulation of ticket prices in South cinemas and more. Read on.\n\nPutting the price tag\n\nMovie ticket pricing is a function of the law of demand and supply, and it differs not just from cinema to cinema and city to city, but also from the different kinds of seating patterns within one cinema hall. Which implies that within one property, a Gold Class seating and regular seating would be priced differently. The prices are decided upon depending on the cinema, the location, the kind of seating arrangement, the grade of amenities, facilities, services, food and beverage options, and other factors.\n\nChief of Cinema Owners' Association, Nitin Datar sheds light on the economics. âThe average ticket pricing in single screens in cities may go upto Rs 150-200. In B and C Class it may be around Rs 70-80 and in small centers or C class centers it starts with Rs 30-50 depending on the theater, the kind of expenses that have been made or facilities given to the patrons. In Bombay also you will find, many theaters that closed down well before COVID, had the admission rates starting at Rs 30-50. Same with Nasik or other cities. There is also a GST on the admission rates. The GST rates have been fixed by the central government. The maximum GST is 18% if admission tickets are priced Rs 100. If the admission rate is below 100 then the GST is 12%. And this 12% or 18% is maybe shared between the central government and the state government on a 50-50 basis,â he tells ETimes.\n\nFilm trade analyst and distributor Girish Wankhede breaks it down further, âThe pricing is decided on the location of cinema, the services offered, the time slot and in rare cases the budget of the film. Mostly, the festive seasons are priced more as the filmgoers usually spend in that period. Also, the producers of blockbusters play a decisive role in ticket prices along with the exhibitors, which we have also observed during Pathaan. They insist on variable pricing according to their cost of production, time slot and the location of the cinema along with the formats like IMAX, 3D and 2D. Cinemas also offer their premium or regular services in brands like Insignia, Icon, ECX (Enhanced Cinema Experience) and regular talkies. The morning slots are generally kept with low ATP (Average Ticket Price) owing to the preferred timing for college students. Now with Pathaan , there were variable ticket prices everywhere except Hyderabad and Chennai with ATP of Rs 230 approx in regular cinemas and Rs 270 approx in IMAX.â\n\nFilmmaker Suneel Darshan adds that at the outset ticket pricing depends on the audiences at whom the content is targeted. âThe rich and elitist prefer to pay for being in high-end luxurious environs and don't bother about the admission and refreshment rates. Hence if they are the targeted audiences, the theatre owners will compromise a miniscule percentage of the regular viewers visiting for the audi experience. Here the per viewer return is the highest. India's rising affluent and higher middle-class forms the target audiences who normally frequent screens for Hollywood and mega-star cast movies.\n\nThe next category, the large middle class and its youth power which today accounts for over 50% of the viewers form the main catchment zone. It is this class who can 'make or break' the movie's fate. Check out the admission rates and refreshment prices in a city like Hyderabad, Chennai, Indore, Kanpur etc. and you'll figure out how even a scant deviation from normal rates could affect the sales of both, seats and food substantially. The front-benchers who could also be termed as the 'repeat-value' movie-buffs are not the targeted audiences of multiplexes hence they are least desired audiences,â he explains.\n\nChief Programming Officer of Inox Cinemas, Rajender Singh Jyala cites examples to explain the pricing. âForget city to city, ticket prices vary even in the same city,â he says. âI'll give an example of two INOX properties. In Ghatkopar, we have two properties - R-City and Neelyog. Neelyog is a regular property, has a regular screen where you will have ticket prices under Rs 150, maximum will be Rs 200. Whereas R-City has multiple luxury cinemas - IMAX, Insignia etc. Their ticket price is higher as compared to Neelyog. Now, the property has much better ambience, the investment is more, accordingly the pricing is more. This is the reason why within a city, within a catchment also you will have two sets of the ticket pricing based on the property.â\n\nShould there be uniform pricing?\n\nâThere is already a judgment on ticket pricing and we cannot go against the judgment,â says Datar. âI think it is foolish to say that the rate should be uniform everywhere in every cinema. It depends on the theater, location, etc. If the cinema exhibitor or owner has spent a huge amount on the theatre on decoration, on ambience, on AC and seats with latest sound system projection, you cannot expect the owner to keep low rates, because the expenses are also high, the maintenance of cinemas is also high. It is not possible.â\n\nFilm exhibitor and distributor Akshaye Rathi adds, âIt's almost like saying that you make a five star hotel or you run a little dhaba, and you will price the food the same! It can't be like that. To be honest, if you look at the kind of average ticket price in India, it's significantly less than most developed countries.â\n\nJyala agrees, âYou can't have the same pricing for regular screens and luxury seatings, so the uniformity is not the solution. But the decline in theatrical business is not because of ticket pricing. Itâs about the content quality, if the content is good, people are willing to come. Today, Pathaan is seeing unprecedented numbers in the history of Bollywood. Before Pathaan or even before Brahmastra, people have written off Bollywood. Whether it's the media or the people, they were saying Bollywood is done and dusted and now the South industry will rule. But there were some movies in which the content was not up to the expectations of the audience. That's why people didn't come. But if you see Gangubai Kathiawadi, the content was good, people came to watch, the film was a big hit. Then The Kashmir Files, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 were hits, Brahmastra became a super hit against all odds. Drishyam too was a super hit. So it's about the content, if the content is good people will come.â\n\nWankhede resonates, âUniform ticket pricing wonât solve the problem of dwindling theatrical business of films. The issue is not pricing, but the content. Theatrical business is marred by inferior content week after week and we get peripheral rather than understanding the crux. When films like Badhaai Do, Dhaakad, Shamshera, Samrat Prithviraj, Laal Singh Chaddha and Vikram Vedha fail, itâs due to a lazy and inspiring approach towards content. When Gangubai Kathiawadi, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 and Pathaan work, the audience donât crib over the ticket prices. They love their cinema experiences on the big screen and happily pay if the content is right.â\n\nâThe Supreme Court has left it to the forces of demand and supply,â says producer Girish Johar . âIf a theater is in a premium location, it can charge a premium rate for its snacks, samosa and popcorn. If a theater is either in category B or C town or a Mini Metro it can charge lower prices accordingly. So the Supreme Court has left it on the demand and supply forces which the cinema owners can rightly decide. For example, if the premium cinema owners are having no films to play and they are playing medium budget films, they can charge less also. There is no rule to stop them from charging high only. I think the Supreme Court has rightfully left it to the market demand and supply forces.â\n\nRegulated pricing in South cinemas\n\nMovie ticket prices in the South have already been regulated by the government so as to enable commoners to watch movies at multiplexes and single screens at reasonable prices. Suneel Darshan strongly bats for a similar regulation in other parts of the country.\n\nâSince the Southern formula and strategy for production/distribution and exhibition is the most successful where the cinegoer doesn't feel uncomfortable with the rates, resulting in affordability being the key factor in determining formidably high viewership, I strongly suggest that the same is followed in most cinemas and multiplexes,â he asserts.\n\nNitin Datar says itâs the prerogative of the cinema owner. âYou cannot expect other cinema owners to keep the same rates or reduce rates. Whatever the government has allowed as the maximum rates, that will be charged. So, that itself is a restriction on the cinema owners even as they develop their properties the way they like. And secondly, the pricing is the prerogative of the owner because if the film is good, or it is expected to do big business then the prices will be high. Because the distributors and producers demand for the rates to be increased. But except for a few states in the South, there are no such regulations.â\n\nInflation of ticket prices\n\nFan frenzy around superstar films is one factor that drives soaring ticket prices. But over the years, the average price of movie tickets has increased by 30-35% in the last five years. Says Girish Johar, âI think in the last five years, we've increased more than 30 to 35%, which is a very steep rise of which two years were pandemic.â\n\nJyala explains the inflation in prices, âAt Inox, about five years ago, ticket prices were maybe around Rs 190-195, today we are at Rs 225. The inflation rate is more than 5% every year.â\n\nCan lower ticket and FnB price boost occupancy?\n\nWhile several films may have seen massive footfalls despite high ticket pricing, insiders believe a regulation is necessary to make moviegoing more accessible to the masses.\n\nGirish Wankhede feels that the collections of many films would have been way better had there been a cap on pricing like in Hyderabad and Chennai. âThis argument will always hold ground whether lowering the pricing of tickets and FnB will add on more occupancy,â he says. âAnd by looking at the current dismal scene, it needs to be revisited. Pathaan, Avatar 2, Drishyam 2 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 worked because people are hungry for good cinema, pun intended. If the film is right, they are ready to pay. But if itâs bad, they will readily criticise high ticket pricing, higher rates of FnB and so on.â\n\nGirish Johar disagrees that lower prices can increase footfalls. âI personally feel that the government has to do a mixed model in which they regulate some prices. So that every section of the society can watch films and the other portion, the cinema can decide on demand and supply. If the film is of a medium budget, it can have medium, if it is a premium film it can charge premium, 5 to 10% ticket should be moderated by the government and the rest should be based on demand and supply. So, I feel that it should be a mixed model,â he says.\n\nAmong the films that did impressive business recently, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 had relatively low pricing, whereas Avatar 2 and Pathaan were charged higher. âI believe that the audiences went in both those because of the star power and the extravaganza which was being promised to them on the big screen,â says Johar . âBut if the content is mediocre then higher ticket pricing can backfire also like in the case of Shamshera. While we are getting good collections at the box office, the actual footfalls and walk-ins have tapered down. Earlier 4-5 crore people used to watch films and get 100-200 crores, now 3-4 crore people are watching and we are getting higher numbers.â\n\nAkshaye Rathi believes we need to make moviegoing more accessible for the widest number of people. âAnd for that you have single screens, independent multiplexes, you have a section of the exhibition sector that caters to them,â he says. âSo I really think it's important for us to make sure as an industry that this whole varied spectrum of the exhibition sector coexists. And we don't need too much emphasis only on the premium properties and try to create content for them. It's in the interest of the overall health of the industry that every section, organised and unorganised section of the exhibition sector, not just continues to survive, but also thrives, so that moviegoing continues to be accessible financially and intellectually for every section on the move of moviegoers.â\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nKiara Advani to Tripti Dimri: Best wedding-worthy hairstyles flaunted by Bollywood divas\n\nLifestyle\n\nNewly engaged Sobhita Dhulipala's love for this Italian dish is so relatable\n\nFood\n\nFrom pilates to Ghee: 8 fitness tips to steal from Sobhita Dhulipala\n\nLifestyle\n\nNaga Chaitanya films to watch on OTT\n\nEntertainment\n\nAugust long-weekend getaways in India\n\ntravel\n\nDecoding the essence of Hansika Motwani's true beauty\n\nEntertainment\n\n9 foods from Himachal Pradesh that are pure joy!\n\nFood\n\nTaarak Mehta fame Munmun Dutta's inspired ultra-glam looks\n\ntv\n\nTop 8 Tiger reserves in India perfect for wildlife photography\n\ntravel"
