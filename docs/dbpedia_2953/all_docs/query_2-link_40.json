Students will engage in a shared core that will teach them the fundamentals of production and criticism. This program blends analytical thinking, creative expression, and professional experience to develop studentsâ skills in all aspects of digital filmmaking and critique.\n\nÂ\n\nCMFâs foundation rests on the critical view that our students should be empowered to tell their own distinctive, idiosyncratic, and regional stories, rather than have those stories told for them. Our program focuses on narrative and storytelling theories, skills, and application. As moving image/audio storytellers, our students learn about and are trained within the domains of both cultural and aesthetic values.\n\nÂ\n\nThe program begins with an exploration of the theoretical, social, historical, and industry standards within which all media are grounded.Â Through this foundation, students develop strong aesthetic sensibilities, storytelling skills, and a deep appreciation of the impact of audience, culture, time and place upon stylistic choices made during the creative process.Â\n\nÂ\n\nIntensive, hands-on experience drives student learning as they write, plan, produce, cast, budget, finance, shoot, edit, and promote their own work.Â Specific attention is paid to developing critical skills to formulate original ideas, persuasively articulate these ideas, and then combine film tools with storytelling skills to transform their ideas into engaging media.Â Developing studentsâ skills in visual storytelling, audio production, and effective editing is accomplished by creating a variety of professional-quality projects.Â\n\nThe CMF major prepares students to work in the industry whether at a production house, working their way up in the Hollywood system, start their own client-based business, or developing their own personal projects after they graduate. At the very least, students will develop creative and critical thinking skills, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving traits needed to be successful in nearly every career. Furthermore, this major provides a strong foundation for graduate school in filmmaking, digital storytelling, cinema studies, and media studies.\n\nÂ\n\nDocumentary Storytelling emphasis. This emphasis is for students interested in producing documentary projects and nonfiction stories with a variety of media, including audio, photography, and digital filmmaking.\n\nÂ\n\nIndependent Filmmaking emphasis: This emphasis is for students who want to make fiction films from an independent filmmaking approach. Students will become versed in all aspects of production and postproduction.\n\nÂ\n\nMedia Studies emphasis: This emphasis is for students who want to observe, think about, and write about media from a strong intellectual standpoint. Students not only learn about media criticism, but they also engage in some aspects of media production from a critical standpoint, including advocacy, cultural work, and professional applications.\n\nÂ\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n\nCore Creative Media & Film Outcomes\n\nStudents Â­Â­will apply critical and professional standards to the creation and critique of creative media and film.\n\nApply professional standards to the creation of stories through basic techniques of screenwriting and filmmaking.\n\nAnalyze, write, critique, and discuss the cultural, historical, and theoretical forces shaping regional, national, and international media, including works of creative media, client work, documentaries, and film.\n\nDevelop and revise their work based on faculty and peer critiques and audience responses, culminating in final projects that may include fiction, documentary, or client-based films.\n\nDocumentary Storytelling Emphasis\n\nStudents Â­Â­will apply critical and professional standards to the creation and critique of documentary.\n\nRefine their skills in shooting, sound recording, editing, photography, and sound design in a variety of projects.\n\nResearch, plan, produce, budget, finance, shoot, edit, and promote documentary projects.\n\nApply skills of reportingâinterviewing, gathering information, researching people and ideas for potential documentary stories.\n\nRead, write, and discuss the traditions and history of a variety of documentary stories.\n\nIntegrate other areas of knowledge, such as from anthropology, women and gender studies, history, and humanities, in order to help students research potential documentary story topics.Â\n\nIndependent Filmmaking Emphasis\n\nStudents Â­Â­will apply critical and professional standards to the creation and critique of film.\n\nRefine their skills in shooting, sound recording, lighting, directing, editing, and sound design in a variety of projects.\n\nResearch, plan, produce, budget, finance, cast, and promote fiction film projects.\n\nCreate medium and long form fiction scripts.\n\nExamine a variety of foreign and independent film traditions that they can apply to their own film projects.Â\n\nMedia Studies Emphasis\n\nStudents Â­Â­will apply critical and professional standards to analysis of film and media.\n\nSurvey a variety of regional, national, and international media forms.\n\nAcquire and apply media literacy skills while analyzing a variety of film and other media projects.\n\nExamine the various forms of media creation, circulation, and consumption both locally and global.\n\nInvestigate media consumption through an increased understanding of regional, national, and global media practice.\n\nInterpret their own production, circulation, and consumption of media both as a reflection of their own culture and in conversation with media users in other cultures.\n\nEngage in meaningful and productive discussion, debate, and open intellectual exchange with others about regional, national, and global media practice.\n\nDetails Accordion Closed\n\nMajor Requirements\n\nThis major requires 48 units distributed as follows:\n\nCreative Media and Film Common Courses: 24 units\n\nEmphasis -
