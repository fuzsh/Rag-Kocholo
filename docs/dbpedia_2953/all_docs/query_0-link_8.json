        "text": "Most of us enjoy a good film and it becomes even better when we watch films about sales that we can often relate to!\n\nThere are some brilliant films out there that focus around sales or salespeople and today I'm bringing you the 12 absolute BEST sales films. Some of these are serious, some hillarious and some are totally packed with inspiration and motivation.\n\nSo if you want to sell more this year don't just read sales books, watch some sales films as well. In fact if you're running a sales team I'd highly recommend finding time perhaps once per quarter where you get the team together to watch a good sales film.\n\nAnyway.....\n\nHere are the top 12 sales films of all time, they're all amazing but number 1 is definitely my personal favourite (number 2 is also one that isn't often mentioned but is brilliant)!\n\nLet me know your personal favourite or any you would like to add in the comments below:\n\n12) Tommy Boy\n\nBox Office Revenue - $32,700,000\n\n\"Tommy Boy\" is a movie about the world’s most unlikely brake pad salesman. After the death of Tommy Boy Sr, the family business is in need of some major sales. In desperation, Tommy Boy is sent on the road to make the annual sales trip. Tommy Boy and his road companion Richard Hayden learn a lot of hard lessons before they finally learn to make the sales stick.\n\nFor a film that is over 20 years old it actually packs a message that is just as relevant today, that success in sales doesn't come from handshakes and false promises, but from listening and solving.\n\n11) The Wolf Of Wall Street\n\nBox Office Revenue - $392,000,0000\n\nA favorite for many sales people, The Wolf Of Wall Street is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government. Full of fast paced selling, this highlights the energy needed to become super successful in sales.\n\nThere are some out there who think this film glamorizes the negative part of sales which unfortunately it does. However if you can look past that, what you'll see are the core ingredients needed to succeed in sales.\n\n10) Jerry Maguire\n\nBox Office Revenue - $273,600,000\n\nJerry Maguire, played by Tom Cruise, is a successful sports agent. He has the biggest clients, the respect, a beautiful fiancée, he has it all. Until one night he questions his purpose. His place in the world, and finally comes to terms with what’s wrong with his career and life. Full of brilliant sales quotes and sales action, it’s a must watch for sales people out there.\n\nOne of the best parts is the challenge Jerry has competing against a large corporate company whilst trying to set up on his own. What he soon realises is that the gimmicks don't work and in fact it's the stregnth of the relationship with his customers that brings the most value.\n\n9) Boiler Room\n\nBox Office Revenue - $28,000,000\n\nThis film is often compared to Wall Street, following the life of a small time stock broker trying to make it big. There are some great scenes for sales people including a lesson on how to sell!\n\nOnce again touching on a big core lesson, Giovanni soon finds out that the company he works for isn't exactly above board. He is then stuck with the decision of whether he ignore this and enjoys the huge income, or does he do the right thing. There's also an amazing speech by Ben Afflecks character in the film!\n\n8) Moneyball\n\nBox Office Revenue - $110,000,000\n\nMoneyball tells the true story of Billy Beane, the manager of a poor performing baseball team. With no budget and a stubborn team, Billy enlists a Yale economics graduate who uses data to build a top performing team.\n\nOften stuck with no resources and the world against them, this is a film and story that a lot of salespeople will be able to relate to. The film was nominated for an Oscar and is a brilliant film from start to finish!\n\n7) Death of a Salesman\n\nBox Office Revenue - $1,200,000\n\nSalesman Willy Loman is in a crisis. He’s about to lose his job, he can’t pay his bills, and his sons Biff and Happy don’t respect him and can’t seem to live up to their potential. He wonders what went wrong and how he can make things up to his family. Great acting, great actors, and a definite must-see for salespeople.\n\n6) Used Cars\n\nBox Office Revenue - $11,700,000\n\nLet's face it, the used car salesman is the single worst stereotype of the sales industry. This film pretty much captures it all! Robert Zemeckis does a brilliant job with Kurt Russell taking the lead role. Definitely a must watch for anyone working in sales.\n\n5) The Pursuit Of Happiness\n\nBox Office Revenue - $307,100,000\n\nOne of my personal favorites, this is the film the really inspire you to work hard, to work harder than anyone else can or does. Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner, Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a “Bone Density scanner”. He feels like he has made these devices. However, they do not sell as they are marginally better than the current technology at a much higher price. After seeing a stock broker pull up in a fancy car, he pushes himself to unbelievable limits to become one and provide for his family.\n\nFor me it's the relentless drive that is the most powerful part of this film. This is something that is key in sales, if you genuinely want to sell more or achieve more you're going to need to push further than most people will. A fantastic film and definitely a must watch!\n\n4) Wall Street\n\nBox Office Revenue - $43,900,000\n\nA classic film that has that retro sales feel to it. Gordon Gekko is a corporate star who a young Bud Fox aspires to be. Gordon takes Bud under his wing showing that he must do anything to get to the top (which included illegal trading). My favorite sales quote, “Greed is Good!”.\n\n3) Glengarry Glen Ross\n\nBox Office Revenue - $10,700,000\n\nThe most famous sales movie of them all, and yet I can guarantee so many sales people out there will never have seen it! Most will know about A.B.C – Always Be Closing, well this is where that came from. It’s real estate, it’s phones, it’s knock-down-drag-out sales. It’s awesome! My favorite quote along with A.B.C is “Put that coffee down, coffee is for closers”!\n\n2) Joy\n\nBox Office Revenue - $101,100,000\n\n\"Joy\" is a film about a very well known entrepreneur, Joy Mangano, the inventor of self wringing mops. As a divorced mum living on very little, Joy is excited when her product is picked for TV shopping channel QVC. Unfortunately the salesman presenting is fails to sell any! Joy then takes the challenge and well I'll let you watch the film :)\n\nThis film is just brilliant and such a powerful reminder that genuine belief and passion sell better than gimmicks and sales tactics.\n\n1) The Founder\n\nBox Office Revenue - $24,100,000\n\nQuite possible my personal all time favourite sales film, The Founder tells the story of pretty much where McDonalds came from. The story follows Ray Croc, a milkshake salesman who saw the potential in a small burger restaurant.\n\nI won't give too much away here as this is one to enjoy watching without spoilers, but it is one I would HIGHLY recommend, especially if you work in sales!\n\nThere it is, what I believe to be the 12 BEST sales films of all time!\n\nNow I would really love to know what is YOUR all time favourite sales film?\n\nIs it one on the list above or perhaps one I've missed out?\n\nPlease do let me know in the comments!\n\nIf you enjoyed this blog please click LIKE and click SHARE to share it with your network, thank you!\n\nIf you enjoyed this post please take time to read some of my other recent posts.\n\nStop Micro-Managing Salespeople\n\nThe MUST-HAVE Sales Books of 2018\n\nThe 10 Things That Will NEVER Change In Sales\n\nHow To Make Cold Calling Fun!\n\nAbout the author:\n\nDaniel Disney is one of the world's leading sales, social selling and LinkedIn experts.
