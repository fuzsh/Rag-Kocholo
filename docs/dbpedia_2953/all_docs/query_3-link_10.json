How much was the blouse?\n\nSource: http://www.themathpage.com/alg/word-problems.htm\n\nFirst, identify what the question is asking for.\n\nJane spent $42 for shoes. This was $14 less than twice what she spent for a blouse . How much was the blouse?\n\nNext, identify the numbers.\n\nJane spent $42 for shoes. This was $14 less than twice what she spent for a blouse . How much was the blouse?\n\nNext, identify the key words. These include add, subtract, remove, spend, earn, less, more, times, twice, half, etc.\n\nJane spent $42 for shoes. This was $14 less than twice what she spent for a blouse . How much was the blouse?\n\nFinally, convert everything into an equation.\n\n#42=2*\"blouse\" - 14#\n\nNow, solve the equation.\n\n#56=2*blouse#\n\n#blouse = 28#\n\nThe blouse was 28 dollars.\n\nIf a mathematical problem is expressed in words, then first try to express all the relevant information in the problem in terms of symbols representing unknowns, in the form of equations, inequalities, etc.\n\nOnce you have a symbolic representation of the problem - typically in the form of a set of simultaneous equations to be solved, try eliminating variables one at a time by rearranging terms, using basic arithmetic operations and substitutions.Eventually this process will probably lead to values (or at least constraints) for all of the unknowns.\n\nConvert these values or constraints back into the context and language of the problem to express the solution.\n\nFor example, suppose Andrew is half the age of Brian, Brian is three times older than Charles and the sum of their ages is 44 years. How old is Charles?\n\nUse #A# to represent Andrew's age, #B# to represent Brian's age and #C# to represent Charles's age.\n\nThen expressing the information in the problem symbolically we have:\n\n#A = 1/2B#\n\n#B = 3C#\n\n#A+B+C = 44#\n\nand we want to determine #C#\n\nFrom the first two equations, we have #A=1/2B=1/2(3C) = 3/2C#\n\nSubstituting #A=3/2C# and #B=3C# into the third equation we find:\n\n#44 = A+B+C = (3/2C) + 3C + C = 11/2C#\n\nMultiplying both ends by #2/11# we find\n\n#C = 8#\n\nSo Charles is 8 years old."
