Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2024 Academy Awards ceremony will cost a whopping $56.9 million.\n\nWalletHub's 2024 report found that it takes $56.9 million to put on the Academy Awards.\n\nThis is just a fraction of the money spent on the actual nominees, though. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" — which is nominated in 10 categories this year, including best picture — had a budget of $200 million, higher than any of the other best picture nominees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach gold-plated Oscar award costs $400.\n\nThe estimated cost of each 24-karat gold-plated mini statue awarded to winners is about $400.\n\nThe Academy gives out awards in 24 categories, and a winner is not allowed to sell their statue without first offering to sell it to the Academy for $1, according to its policy.\n\nCouples must pay at least $100,000 for tickets to the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.\n\nEach year, the highly anticipated, ultra-glamorous event hosted by Vanity Fair is attended by Hollywood's biggest stars — often after they've had a change of wardrobe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscar goodie bags contain gifts like skincare, luxury getaways, snacks, and appliances and are worth $125,000.\n\nWalletHub estimates that the value of each goodie bag given to Oscar nominees is $125,000.\n\nBut, the \"Everybody Wins\" bags aren't actually gifted by the Academy, they're the work of LA-based marketing agency Distinctive Assets, reported PRNewsire.\n\nSome of the most extravagent gifts in 2024's bags include trips to Switzerland and St. Barts, the full line of Miage skincare products, and luxury kitchen appliances from THOR Kitchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt costs $10 million to complete the look of an A-list actress for the Oscars.\n\nWhile A-listers wear multi-million-dollar looks, the cost of dressing a first-timer at the Oscars is $266,000, reported WalletHub.\n\nBecause the cost of a look varies based on a person's stardom, the average cost of a look at the Oscars is about $1.5 million.\n\nIn 2014, Cate Blanchett made Oscar history when she wore a $18.1 million look. Her $100,000 Armani Privé gown was the least expensive element of her outfit — her jewelry alone was estimated to cost $18 million.\n\nThe only person to wear even more expensive jewelry was Lady Gaga in 2019, whose 128-carat yellow diamond Tiffany & Co. necklace cost $30 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 30-second advertisement that premieres during the Oscars costs close to $2 million.\n\nLast year, an average of 19.9 million people tuned in to watch the show, WalletHub reported. That's an 8% increase from 2022, so it's no surprise that running an ad during the live event's commercial breaks is expensive.\n\nIt costs $1.85 million to buy 30-seconds of ad time during the Oscars, which is 73% less than the $7 million it cost to run an ad during the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC makes at least $120 million in ad revenue on Oscar Sunday.\n\nWalletHub estimates that ABC, the TV network that hosts the awards, makes $120 million in ad revenue on the day of the Oscars.\n\nUpwards of $23 million of that revenue comes from the pre-show red-carpet coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollywood spends upwards of $100 million on awards-season lobbying.\n\nTurns out, winning an Oscar requires much more work than just releasing a movie.\n\nIn 2023, The New York Times reported on the competitve nature of Oscars campaigns, in which professional strategists seek to shape public opinion on films, actors, and opponents.\n\nWalletHub estimates that over $100 million are spent on lobbying each year — that's more than the budgets of best picture nominees \"Past Lives\" and \"The Zone of Interest\" combined.\n\nIt costs $20,000 to stream one film for voters to judge.\n\nThe Academy has gone digital. Rather than paying millions of dollars to send physical copies of the year's nominated pictures to voters, the group has turned to streaming, which costs $20,000 per film.\n\nRead next\n\nOscars Money Actors\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
