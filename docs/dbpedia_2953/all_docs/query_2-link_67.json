        "meta_description": "A costume worn in the English comedy film Ali G Indahouse. Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) unwittingly becomes a pawn in Chancellor Carltons (Charles Dance) plan to overthrow the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon). However, instead of bringing the Prime Minister down, Ali is embraced by the nation as the voice of youth and realness, making the Prime Minister and his government more popular than ever.pThis costume was worn by Ali G for the scene in which he and Julie (Kellie Bright) attend a gala event at the Prime Ministers Chequers retreat. The costume consists of a long white faux-fur coat with faux-jewel buttons, a green-coloured suit with fake snakeskin material on the collar and pockets and faux-jewelled buttons, a black shirt made of a satin material with a sparkling pattern down the front and a faux jewel at the collar (marked as a size 6), a pair of black and white loafers (UK size 12) and a black beanie hat.ppLightly worn on the production, the costume remains in very good condition.p",
