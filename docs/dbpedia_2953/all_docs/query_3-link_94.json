        "text": "Predicting society&#39;s reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adaption rate has become an emerging field of data analysis. The multi-billion-dollar business, motion picture industry and there is a massive amount of data is available over the internet related to movies. This study proposes a decision support system for movie investment sector using techniques of machine learning. This research will help investors engaged with this business for avoiding investment risks. The system predicts an approximate success rate of a movie based on its profitability by analyzing historical data from different sources like International Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo and Metacritic. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network and Natural Language Processing the system predicts a movie box office will be a hit or flop based on some pre-released features and post-released features.\n\nThe success of a movie is crucial for hundreds of people who labour behind the scenes as well as the movie's producers. They rely for their subsistence money generated by the film. The precise foreseeing of a. It's difficult to predict if a movie will be successful or unsuccessful because it has a lot of unknown parameters. In light of this, the machine learning (ML) use in determining if movie will succeed or fail may significantly lower the financial burden shared by all parties. The emphasis of this article is on creating a program that can assist in anticipating the movie's early success will encourage investors to invest analysis is done on some of the patterns from the movie the IMDb collection. Using data gathered from several sources and the system uses a variety of machine learning methods estimates a film's likelihood of success based on its success by looking at historical data from places like IMDb, Reputable Tomato. Experimental findings show that the scores are really outstanding throughout the testing stage. Additionally paper ends by identifying the top actors or actresses in to ensure that the film makes the most money possible. This investigation highlights the value of prediction in the professional realm. Since only these projections serve as the foundation for all capital investments.\n\nWith the growth of the movie industry, it is becoming increasingly important for the stakeholders to get an idea about the probable profit made by the movie in the box office. In fact, among movies produced between 2000 and 2010 in the United States, only 36% had box office revenues higher than their production budgets, which further highlights the importance of making the right investment decisions. To address this issue, different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this study to predict the box office return of a movie based on the data available before the release of the movie. The models use 35 movie parameters from 3200 movies as inputs to predict the profit made by a movie and classify the success of a movie from \"flop\" to \"blockbuster\" based on the generated revenue. An analysis of different machine learning architectures is also presented in this research. Finally, a system is proposed that produces comparable results with existing researches in this field and it can predict the profit generated by a movie with a \"one class away\" accuracy of 85.31% without using any sales information.\n\nPurpose: Data analytics techniques can help to predict movie success, as measured by box office sales or Oscar awards. Revenue prediction of a movie before its theatrical release is also an important indicator for attracting investors. While measures for predicting the success of a movie in box office sales and awards are widely missing, this study uses data analytics techniques to present a new measure for prediction of moviesâ€™ financial success.Methodology: Data were collected by web-scraping and text mining. Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forests, Conditional Forests, and Gradient Boosting were used and a model for prediction of movies&#39; financial success proposed. Content strategy and generating high profile reviews with complex themes can add to controversy and increase the chance of nomination for major movie awards, including Oscars.Findings/Contribution: Findings show that data analytics is key to predicting the success of movies. Although predicting sa...\n\nThe film industry is one of the most popular entertainment industries and one of the biggest markets for business. Among the contributing factors to this would be the success of a movie in terms of its popularity as well as its box office performance. Hence, we create a comprehensive comparison between the various machine learning models to predict the rate of success of a movie. The effectiveness of these models along with their statistical significance is studied to conclude which of these models is the best predictor. Some insights regarding factors that affect the success of the movies are also found. The models studied include some Regression models, Machine Learning models, a Time Series model and a Neural Network with the Neural Network being the best performing model with an accuracy of about 86%. Additionally, as part of the testing data for the movies released in 2020 are analysed.\n\nMovie prediction is an important way to predict movie revenue and performance. Through data analysis, we can find the most popular genres, performance in recent years and how it affects the reputation of the next movie. As movie production incurs huge cost and efforts, our effort is to predict the percentage of success, so that production could be managed accordingly. Throughout the paper, we will discuss about the different ways in which the data analysis used by the film gives a precise idea to each production about the best or worst chances of success and/or failure. In this paper, our goal is to focus on predicting the profitability of a film to support film investment decisions in the early stages of film production. The movie producers and directors can make use of the proposed model in various ways like: modify the movie criteria for becoming blockbusters, launch movie at particular time period to get maximum profit, predict the fan following to get a blockbuster and so on.\n\nPurpose: This study analyses how modern data analytics techniques can help us understand the success of movies, as measured by their box office or attributed Oscars. Methodology: Box office revenue data on the first week after the release of the movie as drawn from www.boxofficemojo.com. Findings: Predicting box office revenue based on data available before the release of the movie remains difficult, even with state-of-the-art techniques. Prediction markets are a remarkably powerful tool at predicting success at Oscars. A moderate amount of controversy, as measured by the number of underlying themes raised by movie reviewers, may prove to be helpful in obtaining an Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nMovies play an important role in our everyday life. Film industry involves huge investment in terms of money, time, efforts and people. The number of movies produced in the world is growing at an exponential rate and success rate of movie is of utmost importance since billions of dollars are invested in the making of each of these movies. In such a scenario, prior knowledge about the success or failure of a particular movie and what factor affect the movie success will benefit the production houses since these predictions will give them a fair idea of how to go about with the advertising and campaigning, which itself is an expensive affair altogether. So, the prediction of the success of a movie is very essential to the film industry. In this proposed system, we give our detailed analysis of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and predict the IMDb score. This database contains categorical and numerical information such as IMDb score, director, gross, budget and so on and so forth. Th..."
