        "text": "I am excited to share my latest project: a video editor/operator website I programmed and designed for my best friend. It was an excellent opportunity to hone my programming skills. The site uses the React framework, with styled-components for CSS styles. Key learnings: 1. Importance of responsive design for larger screens. Focused mainly on mobile and desktop versions, I overlooked bigger screens initially, leading to a less-than-ideal display. 2. The perils of rushing. It's easy to make mistakes when you're in a hurry. Remember, as the saying goes, \"You learn as you go.\" This project was my first small, static website venture. It's not perfect, but I'm proud of the outcome. I imagine a senior programmer might give me a Gandalf-and-Pippin-at-the-well kind of look, but that's all part of the learning process! The main goal was to \"make it better than it was.\" Focusing on this helped me deliver a product my client is thrilled with. Happy client, happy me! Curious to see it? Here's the link: https://burbosfilmai.lt/ Feedback and thoughts are always welcome! P.S. I'm still on the lookout for a company where I can grow, improve, and call it my second home. Excited for new opportunities and adventures! 😄\n\nWhat is EOC Studios? I started EOC Studios to support my creative endeavors in film, music, writing, and so on. It split into two things: The aforementioned creative endeavors. C2C for billing my Program Manager consulting roles which are not either W2 and 1099. Moving forward I will reboot the studio and the website to focus on the creative endeavors. It will be in support of another project I am working. More on that later. For now, embrace your inner creative drive (which I call you Creative Kraken). To me, it is only when you embrace this and share it with the world in any role you CHOOSE or FIND yourself. Regardless of what it is from the socially accepted \"creatives\" (writers, actors, film producers, music, etc.) to more standard roles (i.e. PM, developer, auditor, etc.). Let out your Creative Kraken!!!\n\nWill SORA replace filmmakers and video creators? If you're unfamiliar with SORA, it's worth checking out, especially if you're a filmmaker, video creator, or viewer. This technology is making waves, with reports suggesting that Tyler Perry has paused an $800 million studio expansion after encountering OpenAI's SORA. As a filmmaker and video creator, I don't see this tech as a threat. Instead, I view it as a valuable tool to enhance the speed and quality of video production. My approach is to embrace and learn from it, turning it into an advantage for my work. What are your thoughts on this?

NOTE: This is not an official trailer, I was not paid or commissioned by anyone from Bandai, Sunrise, NYAV Post or anyone from the series to work on this. I made this trailer all on my own using only the materials and information available online to the public. If you know where I got my start in voice work, then you'd know that I would not be a professional voice actor if it weren't for Code Geass. I was heartbroken that I didn't get auditions for this dub, so I wanted to do something to show my appreciation and love for the series and help introduce this franchise to the current generation. So here's hoping that this series will be a success and that Disney will give it support for more endeavors in the future. If you've got Hulu or Disney+ (with a VPN) then I highly recommend you go check it out. #codegeass #Roze #RozeoftheRecapture #Englishdub #trailer\n\nPhew... 60 click maps, 5 languages, complex routing, randomisation, the LOT!

While the classic approach of utilizing free public spaces such as parks and beaches can alleviate some costs, it's the innovative methods that are really changing the game for indie filmmakers. Crowdsourcing platforms like LocationHub are bridging the gap between filmmakers and property owners, offering access to unique locations without breaking the bank. Moreover, virtual scouting tools such as Google Street View and Matterport allow filmmakers to explore locations remotely, saving significant time and resources. Yet, the path is not without its hurdles. Limited resources and complex legal considerations around location agreements pose significant challenges. By leveraging community support, embracing technological innovations, and navigating legal landscapes wisely, indie filmmakers can turn these challenges into opportunities, creating memorable settings for their stories even on a tight budget. Let's continue to support and innovate in the indie film industry, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on screen. #IndieFilm #FilmProduction #Innovation For more insights, go to www.kvibe.com"
