With multiple blockbuster hits in his bag, Saif Ali Khan has proven from time to time that he is one of the prominent actors of the film industry. Last seen in Taanaji (2020) and Jawaani Jaaneman (2020), Saif was one of the few actors who's film was released on the big screen in 2020 before the covid-19 pandemic hit our lives. And now, Saif is ready to be back on the screen with not only one, but two films.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBefore we dive into the details of his upcoming films, lets have a look at is last three films.\n\nSaif Ali Khan's last three films\n\nJawaani Jaaneman (2020): A romantic comedy, Jawaani Jaaneman (2020) was directed by Nitin Kakkar, and starred Sail Ali khan along with Tabu and Alaya Furniturewalla. The film revolves around Jazz, a property broker and party-animal in London, who has to confront a daughter he never knew he had, who is also pregnant. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, but was not successful on block office, as it only earned Rs. 44.77 crores.\n\nTanhaji (2020): Before Jawaani Jaaneman, Saif was seen in the blockbuster hit Tanhaji alongside Ajay Devgan and Kajol. The film is set in the 17th century and revolves around Tanaji's attempts to recapture the Kondhana since it passes on to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

It features Saif as a bounty hunter called Gossain who goes on a killing spree with the intention of exacting revenge upon a Subedar named Rahmat Khan, who is also being chased by the Marathas. The film was not a hit at the box-office and was received negative-to-average reviews from the critic.\n\nSaif Ali Khan's upcoming movies\n\nBunty aur Babli 2: We all loved Bunty aur Babli (2005) where Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji played con-artist partners-in-crime.
