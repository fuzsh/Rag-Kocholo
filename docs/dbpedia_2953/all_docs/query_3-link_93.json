        "text": "In a candy store, there are N different types of candies available and the prices of all the N different types of candies are provided. There is also an attractive offer by the candy store. We can buy a single candy from the store and get at most K other candies (all are different types) for free.\n\nFind the minimum amount of money we have to spend to buy all the N different candies.\n\nFind the maximum amount of money we have to spend to buy all the N different candies.\n\nIn both cases, we must utilize the offer and get the maximum possible candies back. If k or more candies are available, we must take k candies for every candy purchase. If less than k candies are available, we must take all candies for a candy purchase.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput : price[] = {3, 2, 1, 4} k = 2 Output : Min = 3, Max = 7 Explanation : Since k is 2, if we buy one candy we can take atmost two more for free. So in the first case we buy the candy which costs 1 and take candies worth 3 and 4 for free, also you buy candy worth 2 as well. So min cost = 1 + 2 = 3. In the second case we buy the candy which costs 4 and take candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also We buy candy worth 3 as well. So max cost = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nOne important thing to note is, we must use the offer and get maximum candies back for every candy purchase. So if we want to minimize the money, we must buy candies at minimum cost and get candies of maximum costs for free. To maximize the money, we must do the reverse. Below is an algorithm based on this.\n\nFirst Sort the price array. For finding minimum amount : Start purchasing candies from starting and reduce k free candies from last with every single purchase. For finding maximum amount : Start purchasing candies from the end and reduce k free candies from starting in every single purchase.\n\nBelow image is an illustration of the above approach:\n\nMinimum amount :\n\nMaximum amount :\n\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\n\nOutput\n\n3 7\n\nTime Complexity : O(nlogn)\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(1)\n\nAnother Implementation:\n\nWe can use the help of The Least integer function (Ceiling function) using built-in ceil() function to implement:\n\nBelow is the implementation in Python:\n\nOutput\n\n('minimum ', 3) ('maximum ', 7)\n\nTime Complexity: O(nlog(n))\n\nAuxiliary Space: O(1)"
