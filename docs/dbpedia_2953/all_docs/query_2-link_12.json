        "text": "New Revenue share between Theatre & Producer. Theatres must pay producers share percentage based on average occupancy irrespective of the budget of the films. Revenue share must be based on performance and not be based on artists or production banners or budgets. A big film sometime May not get audience, sometimes a small film can get a good audience. Theatre share should be based on occupancy levels without bias for all movies. Provide live sales tracking dashboard and keep threshold for percentage. There should be a condition like : If a Theatre plays Trailer then there should be a different percentage and if theatres donâ€™t promote then there should be a different percentage. Example : If Average occupancy is : 30% Then share can be : 30 (For Producer) : 70 for (Theatre) : Minus 10% from theatre if they donâ€™t play trailers. If Average occupancy is : 40% Then share can be : 40 (For Producer) : 60 for (Theatre) : Minus 10% from theatre if they donâ€™t play trailers. If Average occupancy is : 50% Then share can be : 50 (For Producer) : 50 for (Theatre) : Minus 10% from theatre if they donâ€™t play trailers. If Average occupancy is above 50% Then share can be : 60 (For Producer) : 40 for (Theatre) : Minus 10% from theatre if they donâ€™t play trailers. â€”â€”- If they follow the above method, they can use this percentage for any no of weeks and any no of re-release. This will atleast give a slightly better level playing field and put back confidence in producing for new talents. A big budget non-performer cannot espace with muscle power. A small budget performer will strive better to do good work. This must be the way to grow an industry in a healthy way and have a healthy competition. â€”â€”- The above percentage is applicable only if there is no VPF ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Regards #Arunkanth #MovieTheatre #RevenueShare #FilmProducer #Filmmaking\n\nIn this October edition of Half-Hour, I am discussing show calling and how the role of the show caller might change depending on the type of production you are working on, and what considerations need to be made in certain scenarios, and what expectations to have going into these scenarios. Iâ€™ve been thinking about how to approach writing this article for many months, and it will probably be an article that gets updated from time to time. - Bryan Runion #stagemanager #stage #show #theatre #performance #production #stagemanagement #entertainment #liveentertainment #theatreartlife #theatrelife #showproduction #backstage #showmanagement"
