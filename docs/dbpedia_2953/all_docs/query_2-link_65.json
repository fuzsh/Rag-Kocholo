        "text": "Mumbai, Aug 4 (IANS) Director Imtiaz Ali has not even promoted his own films like this -- but for National Award winning movie 'Antardwand', the filmmaker went an extra mile and dressed as a groom to promote it.\n\n'I saw this film before it got the National Award and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not boring. It is quite entertaining and also it talks about a topic that is so relevant,' Ali told IANS.\n\n'So I decided to help in the promotion process because these are small films and need an impetus so that people get aware of their existence,' he added.\n\n'Antardwand', directed by Sushil Rajpal, is a film based on a true story of groom kidnapping in Bihar. The film is slated to hit the screens Aug 27. In order to promote the film, Ali dressed like a groom and addressed the media here.\n\nAli, who has directed films like 'Jab We Met' and 'Love Aaj Kal', revealed that he was also inclined towards the film because he hails from a region where groom kidnapping is a rampant practice.\n\n'I can quite relate to this topic because I come from Jamshedpur and close to that area this practice is quite rampant. So I was happy that now there is a film that highlights this issue. Last year, almost 1,000 cases of groom kidnapping were registered,' enlightened the director.\n\nThe film that has been made on an approximate budget of Rs.1.5 crore stars Raj Singh Chaudhary, Vinay Pathak, Swati Sen and Akhilindra Mishra, among others.\n\nAli also wants to highlight the point that all socially relevant films are not art house cinema, something that is usually perceived.\n\n'A lot of movies that are socially relevant are expected to be boring and art house so I wanted to bring forth that this film is quite entertaining, quite fast paced. All films with social issues are not art house cinema,' he told IANS.\n\nAsked if he would like to make a film on a social issue, the director said: 'I am getting inspired to do that, but that will only happen when I really feel strongly about an issue.'"
