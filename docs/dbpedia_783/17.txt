Sarah Kirsch

(1935-2013; also creative non-fiction, radio plays and children’s books; born Ingrid Bernstein, changed her name to Sarah in protest against her father’s anti-Semitism; married to poet Rainer Kirsch 1960-68; perhaps Germany’s most well-known post-war female poet after Bachmann; after signing a protest against the expulsion of singer/songwriter Wolf Biermann emigrated from GDR to FRG 1977; lived alone in the North Sea-dominated heath- and bog-land of Schleswig-Holstein; the translations largely maintain her lineation and punctuation)

Ravens

the trees in these wind-blown

skies rolling over the land

are taller than the churches

hunched up like clucky hens, and clouds

fly through the tree tops the birds

move from branch to branch coal-black ravens

flutter down onto the shoulders

of pagan gods and croak up

the elders’ ears all mortals

dobbed in weak souls

above the roots and wingless.

Breath Pause

the sky is smoke grey ash grey mouse grey

lead grey stone grey in the land

of sudden showers of continuous thunder

the bloated meadows the gardens

rotting and dogs during the night

have grown fins they dive

after every silver spoon that

falls from the window when instantly

portly marmalades are being made

in kitchens flown through in fine weather

by farmers’ wives with hay in their pants

steam in their bums on turnip fields at noon.

In the Country

Mornings I feed the swans evenings the cats in between

I walk over grass pass by the ruined orchards

Pear trees grow in rusty ovens, peach trees

Collapse into grass, the fences have long surrendered, iron and wood

Everything rotten and the woods embrace the garden in a lilac bush

There I stand with wet feet close to the bushes

It has rained a long time, and I see the ink-blue umbels, the sky

Is spotty like blotting paper

I’m dizzy with colour and smells but the bees

Stay in the hive even the gaping mouths of the nettle blossoms

Don’t pull them over, perhaps the queen

Suddenly died this morning the oaks

Breed gall wasps, thick red balls will probably soon burst

I’d love to lighten the trees but there are too many little apples

They effortlessly reach the crowns and cleevers

Grab me, I distinguish reeds and sedges so much nature

The birds and black snails and everywhere grass, grass that

Moistens my feet fat-green it squanders itself

Even on the tip it hides glass grows in broken mattresses I flee

Onto the artificial cinder path and will presumably soon

Return to my concrete city here you’re not in the world

Spring doesn’t let up in its bottomless greed, stuffs

Eyes and ears with grass the newspapers are empty

Before they arrive here the wood is in full leaf and knows

Nothing about fire

Sweetly summer reaches through the window

Sweetly summer reaches through the window

His hands spread out like lindens

Serve me honey and spiralling blossoms, he

Puts me to sleep, throws light and shade

Curly tendrils around my feet, I

Love resting under him outside, the depressions

Of my heels of his toes are filled into ponds

Where my head lies the ground cushions

With aromatic herbs my hasty friend, berries

He stuffs into my mouth, tigered bumble bees

Buzz the rhythm, fine images

Build up in the sky

He embroiders my body with wild roses – oh

I’d love to not look up from his blue

If there weren’t brothers and sisters behind me

With mines and phosphorous, young

Am I to leave, my friend, the world too –

I lament the last lines of what

I write run to war

In Summer

The land is sparsely populated.

Despite gigantic fields and machines

The villages lie sleepily

In box tree gardens; stones

Thrown seldom hit the cats.

In August stars fall.

In September the hunt is announced by bugle.

The grey goose still flies, the stork slenders

Through un-poisoned meadows. Oh, the clouds

Like mountains they fly over the forests.

If you don’t subscribe to a newspaper here

The world is in order.

Your face is beautifully reflected

In the plum-jelly kettles and

The fields glow fire-red.

End of the Year

This autumn the mushroom clouds

Became such a normal sight in the magazines

That aesthetic categories began arising

While viewing the photographs

The condition of the blue planet was foreseeable

The term neutron bomb frequently appeared

Like its brothers petrol prices weather report

It became as everyday as peace demands.

My child has come home with a D

What should I say it’s hard

Looking at him to bear his innocence

And we are living our improbable

Adventurous lives correcting the D

He goes to school we plant trees

Hear the emergency alarm ABC weapon warnings

Know the speeches of everyone’s generals.

Earthsmoke

And at different times it happens

That we’re very happy about

Something or other a message

The new lover the child

Can move about then

The dreariest task pleases us

We cook the most wonderful

Recipes clean the windows

And sing kiss

The newly opened blossom

On the bush by the door talk

To strangers across the street

And ignore the sun

The lightly dancing snow

Everything is known and familiar

We think it will always be like this

And even the terrible images

In the TVs reaffirm to us

At least here it will stay like this we tidily

Pile up the newspapers that allow us to sleep well

Until they’re collected

We are quite lively hop and jump about

In the furnished apartments of death

Evening

Exuberantly the green changes

From lighter to darker loveliness

Strongly the sun now extracts

The light from the trees

Before it slinks off, the flowers

Village cocks in the morning, welcome

The evening with velvet colours

In the floods of ripe fields

Tardy tractors lurch

The sky grows plum blue

And on the tongue still burns

The bite into the fly agaric

O you good sunken cities

Here things are cheerful and happy

Even the dark begins

In glow and splendour.

Snow

How before our accustomed eye

Everything is transformed the village flies

Centuries backwards in the snow

A few crows are needed

Coppiced willows along the path old fashioned dogs

Love and loyalty reign you pull me over

Ditches carry my stolen

Little bundle of wood into the evening

Living smoke envelopes the roofs.

Motionless

The day arrives out of the forests

Invisible it is snowing in the boundaries

Of yesterday and today I cannot

Distinguish anything on earth

Everything is indistinguishable and equal

The tracks of the wolves the lambs

The frozen hares are covered in snow

It settles on blown-over trees

It seeks to suffocate the living ones

It disappears the streams

Moors and ponds everything is

Equally dead and buried in the twilight

Of sinking turning snow the eyes

Get confused black flakes

Ash does not fall rises or the sky

Allows itself down since creatures are cowering

Breathless motionless the silence without being or moon

It isn’t light or becoming dark

No one is walking the fields the fields

Fields of the dead growing shepherdless by the hour

The snowfall is as long as my life

I have forgotten the name of the place

And the streets kept squares

We are now shortly after the peace

We can’t remember everything

That happened erased awareness

Devoid of people thoughtless no light

No shade pixellated images and only

The strength to not move.
