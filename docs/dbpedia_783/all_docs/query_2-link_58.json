        "text": "Winners\n\nGlenn Richardson\n\nLower Division winner\n\nBetrayal in Brussels: The Conference that Changed International Science\n\nGlenn Richardson’s essay Betrayal in Brussels: The Conference that Changed International Science is the result of an intellectual journey that began in the Bancroft Library reviewing the letters and notebooks of EO Lawrence, but soon left Lawrence behind. As he focused his topic, Glenn discovered the pivotal 1853 International Maritime Conference in Brussels. The more he dug, the more he saw it as a catalyst for the professionalization of science as it is today. Glenn explains his insight this way, “As I read the primary sources, I started to understand why the conference was important. However, when I turned to the secondary sources, I found that I did not fully agree with any of them. What a wonderful thing this was! I could enter this newly discovered conversation with my own thoughts and opinions.” Professor Rodolfo John Alaniz told us, “the scope and analysis of the scope and analysis of the secondary sources is particularly impressive… beyond the scope of a freshman paper.”\n\nTiange Wang\n\nLower Division winner\n\nThe Interior-Exterior Unification in Chinese Literati Residences: A Tool for Upholding the Literati Identity\n\nTiange Wang’s paper, The Interior-Exterior Unification in Chinese Literati Residences: A Tool for Upholding the Literati Identity, explores the significance of garden and home design to the governing elites in Chinese feudal society. Tiange worried that the scarcity of remaining wooden architecture from this period would make her research impossible. But by creative use of visual art and poetry resources from EAL, the Berkeley Art Museum and library databases she successfully demonstrated the spiritual and symbolic drives behind the Chinese literati dwellings. Professor Andrew Shanken notes, “Tiange’s research reflects her intellectual agility and sophistication…. She went well beyond the comforts of the Environmental Design Library, seeking sources all over the university….it is a subtle form of architectural history, made even more so through the translation of Chinese concepts of space.”\n\nJames Bradley\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nThe Union Ruptured: Mechanization, Modernization, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union\n\nJames Bradley began research on his senior thesis The Union Ruptured: Mechanization, Modernization, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union at Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment Library where he “learned of ‘Mechanization and Modernization’ Agreements, signed by the union in 1960 and 1966, which were almost universally admired by observers.” Using the Bancroft Library’s oral histories to discern disagreements between union leaders and members, he ultimately delved into the ILWU’s San Francisco archives to find newspaper clippings that revealed previously disregarded member opposition to the first contract. According to his professor Robin Einhorn, “James went in thinking he was going to be writing about the containerization of ports, but he actually uncovered a much more interesting story about management demands to change work rules…..I suppose the best illustration of his creativity and flexibility .. is that he made the historian’s classic move: go in expecting your sources to say one thing and find that some of the main issues in them are things you’d never thought of before …”\n\nCharlotte Sanger Hull\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nBecoming Atlantic: A Spatial History from Seventeenth-Century Martha’s Vineyard\n\nIn her senior thesis, Becoming Atlantic: A Spatial History from Seventeenth-Century Martha’s Vineyard, Charlotte Sanger Hull argues that early Martha’s Vineyard was neither clearly part of Massachusetts Bay Colony or Plymouth Colony, nor did it fall under the influence of New Netherlands/New York. After plumbing the resources of Doe Library and relying on inter-library loan, Charlotte traveled to the Martha’s Vineyard Museum and local courthouses to examine 17th century genealogical records and land deeds, which in turn led to research at Boston University, Harvard, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the State Archives. Professor Waldo Martin notes, “Most impressive …. was her use of digital mapping techniques and resources, a variety of databases and an inventive array of secondary as well as primary materials. This is an extraordinarily well-research essay.” Professor Mark Peterson explains, Charlotte “used the material culture of the island, from land transactions to forms of payment and exchange brought from afar, to show how its commercial connections ranged far beyond the imperial powers that aimed to control it.”\n\nMarvin Morris\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nFirst in Flight: A Comprehensive Study of Etruscan Winged ‘Demons’\n\nMarvin Morris’s honors thesis, First in Flight: A Comprehensive Study of Etruscan Winged ‘Demons,’ successfully argues that winged “demons” found in Etruscan funerary art were a product of native mythology stretching back to the 7th century BCE and not iconography adapted from Greek sources, as previously believed. Professor Lisa Pieraccini points out that, “UC Berkeley has a formidable collection of books on the Etruscans and Marvin is a wonderful example of how they are being used… Marvin searched for visuals of artifacts that were extremely difficult to find – one even in a rare Hungarian publication --- and found (them). His research is highly unique and innovative…. and could become his focus of study in graduate school.”\n\nElizabeth Ford Rainey\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nThe Education of Joan Didion\n\nElizabeth Ford Rainey uses her thesis, entitled The Education of Joan Didion, to expand our understanding of Joan Didion’s formative years as a UC Berkeley female undergraduate in the 1950’s and the influence they had on her subsequent writing career. The Bancroft Library’s collection of Didion letters and manuscripts included letters to one of Didion’s classmates who Ms. Rainey later interviewed. She also relied on special issues of the Daily Californian edited by Didion found on microform in Doe Library, and returned to the Bancroft Library to find Didion’s first-ever published short story. Professor Scott Saul emphasizes that, “In my 13 years at Berkeley….. none of my undergraduates has capitalized on Berkeley library resources as assiduously as Libby Rainey has in her pioneering work…”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nCameron Silverberg\n\nUpper Division\n\nThe Dragon, the Lion, and the Ballot Box: Evaluating China’s Impact on Democracy in Africa\n\nCameron Silverberg’s honors thesis, entitled The Dragon, the Lion, and the Ballot Box: Evaluating China’s Impact on Democracy in Africa explores assumptions about the impact of Chinese investment on the democratization of key African states. Through extensive use of primary and secondary sources available through library databases, and supported by political science and data librarians, he was able to bolster his thesis using quantitative statistical analysis. Professor Amy Gurowitz notes, “(Cameron’s) multiple regression analyses reveal that there is no statistically significant relationship between Chinese engagement and democratic decline on the (African) continent…. (It) is extremely well researched.\n\nWinners\n\nMichelaina Johnson\n\nLower Division winner\n\n“The River of Revenge”: The Tension Between Farmers and the Federal Government in the Tula Valley, Mexico, 1992-2014\n\nThe paper analyzes wastewater management in the Tula Valley, an agricultural region that receives wastewater for irrigation from Mexico City and ships its produce to the metropolis. Using the lens of environmental history, the paper identifies the conflicting priorities and interests of different actors, primarily the Mexican federal government and the Tula Valley farmers, with regard to health safety, financial stability, and environmental sustainability in the Tula Valley.\n\nRoss Mattheis\n\nLower Division winner\n\nEfficiency in Minoan and Mycenaean Trade Networks in the Late Bronze Age\n\nQuestions surrounding Late Bronze Age trade in the Aegean have concerned the identification of trading partners, the content, scale, and motivation of trade, and the effects of intercultural interaction. The principal challenge in addressing these questions is the establishment of evidentiary “proof” when archaeological data is often scant or fragmentary. This paper attempts a computational reconstruction of trade networks for the Minoan and Mycenaean Periods using a Monte Carlo process to fit networks to observed distributions of artifacts. The process developed in this paper is an attempt to reach confident conclusions while permitting evidentiary gaps. The principal finding was a robust difference in the efficiency in the networks, with the generated Mycenaean period networks consistently less efficient than the Minoan Counterpart. Such a differential in the efficiency could have contributed to the Mycenaean decline around 1200 BCE.\n\nAmy Clark\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nMore Than Meets the Eye: Cultural Color Resonances in Old English Literature\n\nAs a manifestation of both language and cognition – what is seen, and what is named – color represents an important point of access into the human psyche. Color words express more than visual signals; they operate within complex, culturally constructed systems of meaning in most human societies, conveying both denotative and connotative information. As such, they are of particular value in the study of Anglo-Saxon England, where cultural insight must be gleaned from linguistic and literary contexts. As such, we cannot assume that the Anglo-Saxon understanding of color mirrored our own – and we cannot read Old English texts as though they operated in accord with a modern cultural and visual aesthetic. Yet because previous studies of Old English color terminology have focused primarily on questions of denotative significance, many of our questions about the Anglo-Saxon conceptualization of color remain unanswered. In light of this, this paper offers a refocusing of the study of Old English color semantics. The research examines the connotative literary associations operating within three Old English color terms, each the subject of some denotative debate in recent years: sweart (black), read (red) and fealo (fallow).1 Through a conscientious application of both quantitative and qualitative analysis, the paper shows that the connotative resonances of these terms can account for at least some of their denotative ambiguity; that they “look like,” in fact, more than what we can objectively see. In orienting this study towards what the Anglo-Saxons thought about color, rather than what they saw, the paper attempts to re-establish a nexus of color-referent relationships and resonances that will allow for fuller engagement with the aesthetic discourses operating in Anglo-Saxon texts.\n\nSamuel Diener\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nModes of Fictionality in the Works of Daniel Defoe and Captain Charles Johnson\n\nThis paper highlights an often overlooked or dismissed early moment in the emergence of a fictional poetics in the early 1720’s in a succession of the prefaces of Daniel Defoe’s novels, arguing that the transition to what scholars today identify as novelistic fictionality could already be seen in motion at this early date. Then, by comparing Defoe’s first two novels to the contemporaneous General History of the Pyrates, it highlights another, older form of fictionality that was alive and well in the period: the tradition of utopian narrative. This paper shows the ways in which Defoe’s new fictionality diverges from this established form of narrative, embracing a new and more individualistic bent and a kind of imaginative speculation that aims at very different social ends. This case study will provide insight into the development of the kind of fictionality that the novel employed over the course of the century and in many cases still employs today; a verisimilar narrative with an individual protagonist through whom the reader vicariously experiences the events of the story. Such an experience, critics have shown, provided a space for “imaginative play”: a thought-experiment that had the capacity to create new knowledge.\n\nKatherine Gray\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nJohanna Jachmann-Wagner’s Lohengrin: Vocal Philology at the Jean Gray Hargrove Library\n\n“Johanna Jachmann-Wagner’s Lohengrin: Vocal Philology at the Jean Gray Hargrove Library” is an analysis of notes penciled in an 1851 edition of Richard Wagner’s opera Lohengrin during a singing lesson that took place in 1884. The instructor of the lesson was none other than Richard Wagner’s niece, Johanna Jachmann-Wagner, a highly acclaimed singer and actress. This essay extrapolates from the score’s annotations that Jachmann-Wagner was also one of the greatest inspirations for Wagner’s preeminent compositions that post-date Lohengrin. This vocal/piano reduction of Lohengrin belonged to Mary Burrell, a scholar devoted to an exhaustive biography of Richard Wagner that was never completed. The essay in question interprets the score’s annotations as proof that vocal technique and interpretation were major players in the development of Wagner's means of motivic composition. The essay covers a wide array of issues, from the heated debate over \"authentic\" Wagnerian performance practices to the uses of Greek metric schema in the construction of Wagner’s idealistic reformation of the opera into “music drama.”\n\nAndrea Ikeda\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nCowboys, Indians, and Aliens: White Supremacy in the Klamath Basin, 1826-1946\n\nDuring the mid-1870s, the United States waged a brutal war of extermination against the Modoc Indians of the Klamath Basin. Amidst the virulent racism of World War II seven decades later, the federal government incarcerated nearly twenty thousand people of Japanese ancestry on the same land. This paper identifies relationalities between and slippages across the structures of settler colonialism and the discourses of Yellow Peril/Orientalism by examining the parallels and tensions between the two periods. It explores how the fundamental logics of settler colonialism underwrote the intertwined projects of genocide against indigenous peoples and racialized exclusion of non-native people of color. It first examines how federally sponsored incursions into Modoc land routed the indigenous presence and consolidated white land ownership within the region, subsequently solidifying a sense of community predicated on exclusionary racial homogeneity. It then considers the roles incarcerated Japanese and Japanese Americans played in reinforcing iterations of settler colonialism by inhabiting the subjectivities of both the settler and the Native simultaneously. It closes with a discussion of the lasting legacies and implications of these historical traumas—as well as footholds for resistance—in a moment in which settler colonial and racial violence remain as relevant as ever.\n\nAndrew Woo\n\nUpper Division winner\n\nCaught in the Crossfire: Explanations of Insurgency Use of Indiscriminate Violence\n\nUnder what conditions are insurgencies more likely to employ indiscriminate forms of violence against civilians? Whereas some scholars have attributed indiscriminate violence to those insurgencies being simply incarnates of “decentralized criminality,” others have focused on alternative theories such as resource endowment and foreign support as key conditions. This thesis seeks to fill the current gap in the literature by testing competing explanations for insurgent-led indiscriminate violence and arguing that insurgencies are less likely to commit indiscriminate violence when these organizations establish robust vertical linkages with their pre-war social base through political wings and strategies. Data from the regression analysis show rebel political wings to be statistically significant, as well as other potential explanatory variables such as the level of foreign support and strength of control over constituent groups by the central command. Furthermore, process tracing in insurgencies in El Salvador and Uganda outline the mechanisms whereby political wings and activities reduce an insurgency’s use of indiscriminate violence. The implications of the research are that conventional theories that solely focus on resource endowment and foreign actor support are inadequate, and need to account for these political aspects of insurgent warfare. Moreover, counterinsurgents should respond with increased civilian protections when the conditions are conducive for indiscriminate killings.\n\nWinners\n\nTori Cabot\n\nThe Sexual Monster: How the Werewolf is a Lone Sexual Monster and Foil to the Vampire\n\nCabot's paper, completed for a College Writing program class called Monsters and Modernity, addresses werewolves and their role in current young adult literature. Her research focuses on how werewolves are portrayed as sexually deviant racial stereotypes in comparison to an increasingly pure monster, the vampire. Because she originally found few sources solely dedicated to analyzing the racial and sexual connotations of the werewolf, Cabot \"identified the sources that best addressed the problems or issues that were interesting and followed an investigative trail,\" according to her faculty sponsor, Jonathan Lang. Mining citations from the most pertinent documents, Cabot used the Berkeley Libraries to discover Richard Dyer’s seminal scholarship on race and sexuality, as well as other the work of other scholars whose work is central to this field.\n\nRachel Cadman\n\nA Pioneer In Health Care For \"Families Who Follow The Crops\": California and the Making Of the Migrant Health Act, 1949-1962\n\nRachel Cadman's paper explores the genesis of the Migrant Health Act in the context of the emergence of migrant health care clinics in postwar California and shows the important role that activists and politicians played promoting this federal legislation. Her research made extensive use of the archival papers of Florence Wyckoff at UC Santa Cruz, Interlibrary Loan, and Berkeley's numerous electronic resources to compare government documents with news sources of the period. In the words of her instructor, Felicia Viator, Rachel \"depended primarily on these archives, but has also utilized the UCSC Regional History Project interviews, UC Berkeley electronic archives, and the Bancroft collections that allowed her to access The Fresno Bee.\"\n\nLi Duan\n\nFuzhou Shipyard at Fujian: Early Divergence in Late Qing Modernization\n\nLi Duan's honor's thesis was developed over the course of three semesters of independent study. It revisits a well-studied academic field, late Qing modernization of China. By focusing on the Fuzhou Shipyard in the Fujian province, this research explores the role of regional development at the provincial level during this national endeavor. To explore the delicate relationship between center and periphery, Duan compared the dual identity of Fuzhou Shipyard as a national arsenal and as a local factory. A lack of coordinated effort at the national level, conflict between center and region, and an uneven development in social transformation all suggest early divergences within Qing itself. These divergences imply that China's modernization originated from the bottom, and instead of a comprehensive plan from Beijing, these provincial experiences inspired future modernization. As described by his thesis advisor, George Lazopoulos, \"Li is a skilled historian with a sophisticated understanding of historiographical methods, which he applies to a well-selected set of sources in this paper.\"\n\nMatthew William Enger\n\nOrder from Chaos: Ethnogenesis, Direct Democracy and Statecraft in California,1948-1958\n\nEnger refutes the idea of California in the Fifties as being stable by analysing eleven initiatives appearing on the statewide ballots between 1948 and 1958. These initiatives, he posits, \"either represented or catalyzed a modern statecraft and the social trends which transformed California and its self-identity.\" The first chapter covers bringing order out of political chaos with the defeat of cross-filing and the approval of salary increases for legislators. Enger weaves the results of several welfare initiatives with the ending of New Deal consensus in the State. A third step was a change in the racial demography of the State, the passage of an initiative requiring voter approval before allowing the construction of low-income housing, and the resulting inner-city ghettoization of the poor and black. Engel draws a connection between the defeat of four initiatives in 1958, one concerned with the \"right to work\" without joining a union, one proposing the reduction of the State sales tax, one ending blue laws and one ending the exemption from the payment of property taxes by parochial schools, and the alignment of labor and minorities with the Democratic Party. He concludes that \"To study direct democracy in California in the middle of the twentieth century is to observe the ethnogenesis of both a white Californian nation on the West Coast and the emergence of a continent-wide conservative political and social movement.\"\n\nYessica Porras\n\nChurch of St. John the Baptist at Sutatausa: Indoctrination and Resistance\n\nYessica Porras analyzes the relationship of the mural program found in the church of Sutatausa, Colombia as indoctrinating images imbedded with indigenous imagery. Porras argue that besides having a religious message the murals found in the church have direct visual connections with pre-conquest petroglyphs located near the area of Sutatausa. With the help of visual analysis, library resources, and guidance from her advisor Todd Olson, Porras was able to conclude that the church of Sutatausa allows us to recognize that the colonial indoctrinating process was not a smooth process. The imbedded indigenous imagery found in the murals of the church was a method of adaptation and resistance that allowed the preservation of local Muisca indigenous memory throughout time.\n\nJeremiah Trujillo\n\nPosthumous Schubert: The Exhumation of the Solo Piano Works in Mid- and Late-19th-Century Transcription and Editing\n\nIn this essay, Jeremiah Trujillo examines ways in which Schubert’s image was shaped and the reception of his solo piano works changed in the mid-and late-1800’s, well after his lifetime. Trujillo argues that three individuals in particular influenced how Schubert’s music was performed throughout history and to the present day, all in different ways: Franz Liszt, in the 1840’s as a transcriber, performer, and editor; Johannes Brahms, in the 1860’s as a force toward the editing and publication of little-known Schubert manuscripts; and Julius Epstein, in the 1880’s as a music editor who influenced the performance of Schubert’s solo piano works throughout the 20th century. Describing the sophistication of Trujillo’s scholarship and research, Professor James Davies writes that Trujillo “was able to form a complex picture of the field of nineteenth-century Schubert reception by reading through a large number of early German piano editions.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nSidharth Goel\n\nCapitalism Versus the Sharing Economy\n\nGoel's research paper explores how open source culture and community-driven content are sharing knowledge and ideas that will generate more value in today’s economy and global stage. Sloan commends Goel for being \"rigorously reflective, making use of some surprising and interesting research, and taking care to guide the reader through his unfolding understanding of the issues at hand.\" Reviewing the bibliography, we see that Goel carefully synthesized academic works on social media, copyright law, and open source and crowd-sourcing cultures for a thoughtful analysis.\n\nDevin Murphy\n\nAll Becomes One in the Basin of the Waterfall: Dialectics and Multiple Trajectories of Sāmoan History before 1900\n\nThesis advisor Rakesh Bhandari describes Devin Murphy’s thesis as “a painstakingly-researched and well-written piece of work.” In this paper, Murphy writes a comprehensive history of “pre-contact” Samoa. Most historical narratives of Samoa begin with contact with the West which, Murphy argues “de-historicizes” the Samoan people and “their respective narratives, leading one to think that these Pacific Islanders simply … sprouted from lava? emerged from coral? are fixed entities, unmoving, unchanging, bounded by time and space by a fossilize historical trajectory?”\n\nIsaac Wolf\n\nIf You Build it Together, They Will Come: How Three Different Agencies Learned to Work Together to Supply Adequate Water for Phoenix, Arizona\n\nWolf’s senior thesis investigates how the cities of central Arizona – Phoenix in particular – learned to make the compromises necessary to procure additional water supplies. In the years following World War II, Arizona grew exponentially. To secure the water it needed, Phoenix had to compromise with two major suppliers in the area: the Salt River Valley Water Users’ Association (SRVWUA) and the Federal Bureau of Reclamation. These compromises allowed the city first to use water from behind the SRVWUA-operated Horseshoe Dam, then on the rest of the Salt River Project, and finally from the Colorado River via the Central Arizona Project. Wolf laid the foundations for his research at Berkeley using materials in the Bancroft and Main Libraries. His faculty sponsor, Professor Felicia Viator, notes that Wolf was “determined to get to the Valley of the Sun for research, [and so] he applied for – and won – an undergraduate research grant,” to continue his research at the Arizona State Library and State Archives in Phoenix. Viator commented that she has been inspired by Wolf’s “thoroughness and dedication to the process of doing history.”\n\nWinners\n\nStephanie Au\n\nSuccession in Galls on Syzygium malaccense and Their Impact on Leaf Aging\n\nAu’s project, examining the development of plant galls in the Pacific Ocean, was developed over the course of a semester of field research at the Berkeley Gump Research Station on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. Au identified her topic, did extensive research using the databases that provide access to the literature in her field, and through that exploration, identified a research question that had not yet been addressed. To support her work, she had to look broadly through the literature to find studies on similar organisms, and on the phenomenon that she was researching as it applied to other species. Au’s bibliography illustrates a wide range of resources: scholarly articles, plant identification databases, monographs, reference works, and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data. Ultimately, she says in her research essay, her sources “provided a solid foundation for the research she conducted and aligned with the conclusions she drew from her research experiment. Instead of contradicting her findings, her data added to the current research done on galls and filled a niche that was not observed before.” In his letter of support, Professor Rockerick gave high praise to Au’s work, saying it “is a model in all respects,” and commended her on her extensive research, particularly as much of it had to be accomplished remotely.\n\nAlana Mailes\n\nTracing the Influence of Giulio Caccini’s Le nuove musiche on Seventeenth-Century English Composers\n\nMailes’ Honors project in Music explored the role of Italian vocal ornamentation in 17th-century English music, which has resulted, according to Professor Moroney, in “new research in untouched territory.” Since little tangible evidence of her subject remains, Mailes had to delve deeply into the collections of The Library, examining original manuscripts, microforms, books, journals, musical recordings and scores, demonstrating a “sophistication unusual in an undergraduate.” Her research also took her to London and Oxford to view 17th –century English source material. Her research essay demonstrates the iterative nature of her research: she continually returned to the research question informed with new findings in order to refine and improve the thesis. The process has taught her the importance of patience, flexibility, and persistence in Humanities research, and the skills and understanding she has acquired will serve her well as she pursues graduate studies.\n\nMatej Silecky\n\nThe Post-Soviet Development of Elite-Level Athletics in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan\n\nSilecky’s paper explores the nature of elite athletics in Central Asia during the Soviet and Post-Soviet period. When Silecky selected his topic, his professor was concerned that he might not be able to find the sources that he needed to fully explore how five Central Asian countries engage with the Olympic Games. As Professor Mehendale pointed out in her letter of support, “Silecky had to first find scholarly work on the Soviet and Post-Soviet periods to enhance his knowledge on 20th century Central Asia. Subsequently, he had to firm-up his grasp of the history of the Olympic Games…. In addition, Silecky had to gain insight into elite sport participation in each of the five former Soviet republics.” To accomplish this, Silecky accessed both print and electronic materials through the Library’s catalog and article databases, as well as web-based resources on Olympic athletes. He compiled an extensive bibliography of news articles, books, and media footage, thus managing, according to his professor, to weave “together both academic and non-scholarly sources into a coherent research paper.”\n\nPaige M. Walker\n\nMedieval Female Spirituality and the Wound of Christ in Folio 331r of Bonne of Luxembourg’s Prayer Book\n\nThis History of Art Honors Thesis offers a close examination of a single illustration of Christ’s side wound from Bonne of Luxembourg’s prayer book. In her letter of support, Professor Angelova expresses admiration for Walker’s research skills, stating that her thesis \"would not have been possible had it not been for her mastery of the various research tools currently used in the humanities.” With only a rudimentary knowledge of Western Medieval Art, Walker turned her interest in the illustration into a work that, according to her professor, offers “an interpretation that explained the contradictory allusions evoked by the image of the wound, and one that also situated the particularities of the image within its broad art historical, historical, theological, and personal contexts.” To find the resources she needed, Walker used both national and local catalogs, databases of images and articles, manuscripts and rare books in Bancroft Library, digitized primary source collections, and books from local and off-site facilities. In her reflective essay, Walker demonstrates both a sophisticated understanding of research tools as well as recognition of the value of serendipitous discoveries in the stacks.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nChristian Duran\n\nLost in Trans-Nation: Unearthing Chicano Identity in Daniel Venegas’s \"Las Aventuras de Don Chipote o Cuando Los Pericos Mamen\"\n\nDuran’s investigation into the biography and identity of author Daniel Venegas is an object lesson in the value of tenacity in research. Before Duran started digging, little was known about Venegas’s personal life. Duran retrieved personal documents from a genealogical resource, scoured contemporary newspapers for references to the author, uncovered issues of a rare publication within Bancroft Library, and found resources to provide historical context to his investigation. What he uncovered allowed him to interpret the author’s novel in a new light and his finished thesis, according to Professor Saul, “will be a significant contribution to Chicano Studies and American literary history.”\n\nAlexandra Polasko\n\nWhat’s in Your Water?\n\nPolasko’s independent study in Civil Engineering examines the bacterium Dehalococcoides and ways to enhance and maintain its biodegradation of the harmful chemical compound trichloroethene (TCE) in drinking water. In her letter of support, Professor Alvarez-Cohen praises Polasko’s research into water contamination, noting her proficiency navigating the library system, and her ability to identify and obtain “an extensive source of information in a wide variety of media sources that contributed to a well-written, comprehensive paper. In fact,” she says, Polasko’s “skill for identifying and acquiring high quality, relevant publications is the most impressive I’ve ever encountered in a second year undergraduate student.” Polasko’s research required searching across academic journals from multiple disciplines, including chemistry, engineering, and biology. She gracefully articulates her engaged and varied research process, noting that “even though the evidence for my thesis did mainly come from those types of sources, the support for my passion about this topic came from the anthropologists, the philosophers, the authors, the lawyers, the economists, the councilmen, and the government.”\n\nDaniel Wikey\n\nMan as Magician, Man as Machine: Narrative, Wonder, and Politics in Twentieth-Century Lie Detection\n\nWikey’s Anthropology Honors thesis offers an interdisciplinary examination of the development of lie detection in America. In her letter of support, Professor Hayden praises Wikey for his “superb use of BerkeleyB collections on early 20th century American religion, feminist and critical race theory, the folklore archives, and the history of science and technology.” Based on that research, Hayden says, Wikey “makes a number of original contributions to histories of the lie detector test, particularly through his attention to the place of American Spiritualism therein.” Wikey’s bibliography attests to the wide range of resources -- books, articles, archival materials, and digitized primary sources – that informed his intriguing study.\n\nJolene Xie\n\nReciprocity at the Elizabethan Court: The Earl of Leicester and Private Gifts in a Political Arena\n\nThis independent study in the History of Art investigates the struggle for representation and autonomy at the Elizabethan court. Xie made extensive use of the Library’s online and print resources, accessing multiple databases, digitized primary source collections, online art databases, manuscript collections, the print collections of the Gardner Stacks, and the Art History Library, as well as resources from other libraries. Professor Honig says that what makes “Xie’s thesis stand out as a piece of exemplary research is that she has balanced so well between primary, secondary historical, and theoretical sources. She read printed primary sources (and online documentary sources) very carefully; she found data and critical interpretations from art historians, historians, and literary scholars; and she reconsidered all of them in the light of modern (and historical) theories of gifting.” In her reflective essay, Xie does an excellent job of articulating the value of iterative research and the importance of reaching beyond her primary discipline for sources.\n\nWinners\n\nKristina Borrman\n\nThe Paradoxical Persistence of James Earle Fraser’s End of the Trail: Nostalgia, Souvenirs, and the Politics of Pictorial Representation\n\nBorrman’s Honors Thesis in History of Art examines the history of a famous sculpture, James Earle Fraser’s the End of the Trail, a portrait of a tired, hunched over Native American warrior on horseback. The small bronze quickly attracted great acclaim and has been reproduced an untold number of times as bronzes, bookends, posters and even bookmarks. This paper leverages close readings of numerous archival documents from The Bancroft Library, including original contracts with artists and advertisements and ephemera related to the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exhibition in San Francisco. The San Francisco Chronicle electronic database served as a source for understanding the reception of the sculpture, while resources at numerous other campus libraries helped her trace the many ways the image has been used in visual culture and how interpretations of the image have evolved. According to her professor, “Borrman’s biography of this singular object, following its permutations in and out of art contexts for over a century, is an important achievement.”\n\nKashi Gomez\n\nWhere Upside Down is Right Side Up: A Study of Ksemendra’s Narmamala and His Theory of Aucitya\n\nThis paper examines the relationship between 11th century Sanskrit author Ksemendra’s theory of literary propriety and satire in his work, the Narmamala. In what her professor describes as “an original work of scholarship in the field,” Gomez’s close examination of primary texts and exploration into Sanskrit literary theory led her to an appreciation of Ksemendra’s work not commonly shared by others in the field. Gomez used a range of Library digital resources, including JSTOR, Oskicat, and Melvyl, as well as Berkeley’s expansive collections in the South and Southeast Asian Library. Professor Knutson believes that she “has accomplished something exceedingly rare for an undergraduate, [which] would have been impossible to do this [with] a lesser institution’s collection.”\n\nPatricia E. Kim\n\nThe Materiality and ‘Enchantment’ of the Gebel el-Arak Knife and the Gerzean Flint Blade Production\n\nMs. Kim’s honors thesis, which her professor describes as “intellectually creative and imaginative,” explores knife and flint blade production in pre-dynastic Egypt. Using her own practical knowledge of stone knapping, Kim analyzes the knife’s material properties, how it was produced, and then links that to scholarship on the imagery of the knife, producing a better understanding of the knife’s contemporary significance. From multiple libraries on campus, the Hearst Museum, and the Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology, Kim was able to access secondary sources such as museum catalogues, scholarly monographs, and journal articles, as well as uncover rich collections of primary sources, including field notebooks, excavation reports, and physical artifacts. Her research extended beyond campus, where her need to acquire foreign or obscure publications required the use of international catalogs and Interlibrary Borrowing Services to retrieve the resources. As Professor Feldman said, Kim’s “creative approach to the topic, thinking about questions of production (stone knapping), cognition, possession, and enchantment, has drawn upon and relied on the incredible breadth and depth of the Berkeley library holdings.”\n\nMatthew Kintz\n\nSmoke and Mirrors? Examining the Relationship Between Medical Cannabis Dispensaries and Crime\n\nGroups for and against medical cannibas dispensaries make conflicting claims that have significant implications for public health and safety, but have gone untested by scholarly analysis. Kintz’s project involved using sophisticated digital mapping tools and demographic data to examine whether and how these dispensaries might be related to crime rates in San Francisco neighborhoods. For his literature review, Kintz relied heavily on OskiCat and Melvyl to find books located in and outside of UC Berkeley’s collections, and a variety of online databases to locate scholarly articles. He worked closely with librarians in the Data Lab and Earth Sciences and Map Library to acquire data on San Francisco and guidance on using the tools required to map the data he found, which ultimately revealed a weak relationship between medical cannabis dispensaries and crime, casting doubt on the claim that the former are “magnets for criminal activity”. Prof. Bimes praised Kintz’s thesis, asserting that “it is both well-written and demonstrates deep engagement with a range of source materials.”\n\nMorgan Shahan\n\nCaged Revolutionaries: An Examination of Inmate Unity During the Attica Prison Riot of 1971\n\nIn 1971, an uprising occurred at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York. Shahan’s history thesis offers a reinterpretation of the riot by integrating multiple primary source accounts written from different perspectives in order to connect cross-racial unity among prisoners to their heightened politicization during the 1960s and 1970s. Using databases that indexed literature from a variety of disciplines and library catalogs, Shahan was able to find secondary sources analyzing the events. First-hand accounts were located at Bancroft Library and retrieved from other libraries using Interlibrary Loan and newspaper articles and film footage provided other primary sources. Prof. Bielenberg praises her persistence and resourcefulness in locating elusive sources and asserts that Shahan’s “paper really is an epic treatment of the Uprising, and will provide scholars in the field with a wonderful body of research to draw upon.”\n\nRyan Landon Swanson\n\nThe Political Economy of Wind Power in China\n\nSwanson’s thesis drew on an extensive and varied array of sources on the growth of wind power on China: Chinese language article databases and government statistics, international energy statistics databases, newspapers, journal articles, policy papers, even social media tools used by energy analysts. His attempt to explain how technical and political challenges have affected China’s wind power growth resulted in what Prof. Bhandari described as “simply the best thesis that I have read in ISF.” Even Swanson recognized this achievement, stating that writing this thesis “marked the turning point in my education when I began to produce knowledge, not just consume and regurgitate knowledge.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nKapil Gururangan\n\nPharmaceutical Companies and Patient Care – The Mixed Effects Model\n\nGururangan’s project broadens the data applied to a critical question – how do pharmaceutical companies influence healthcare at the level of patient health and access to health services? In answering this question, he explored article databases from a variety of disciplines and print resources located in the Gardner Stacks, and the libraries at Haas School of Business and the School of Public Health and used them to compare the positive and negative outcomes produced by treatment innovation and lobbying capability. Prof. Ross stated that “his ability to research and synthesize information across different disciplines, using starkly different methodologies and various types of data makes his paper stand out amongst his peers.”\n\nEthan Prizant\n\nDivergent Prophecies for the Nation: Wu Guanzhong, History, and the Global in early 1980s China\n\nWu Guanzhong may be one of the best known artists to emerge after China’s Cultural Revolution, but scholarship on the artist and his works in English is limited. Prizant’s examination of Wu’s intentions and how his work has been interpreted and received in China and worldwide was accomplished through dogged and persistent searching through Chinese and English library catalogs, print bibliographies, and online databases. This resulted in a sophisticated analysis of Wu’s work that Prof. Berger described as “graduate level work,” one that includes “the most comprehensive bibliography on Wu Guanzhong that [she has] seen.”\n\nWinners\n\nChase Burton\n\nSpare the Cell, Spoil the Child: The History and Philosophy of American Juvenile Justice\n\nFor his honors thesis in Legal Studies, Mr. Burton wrote a history of the American juvenile justice system from 1899-1967, with a focus on changing philosophies and attitudes towards punishment for juveniles. He discovered that the University Library had in its print collection institutional reports from reform and industrial schools, which he used as primary sources. He also used library databases such as Making of Modern Law to read contemporary texts on youth criminology, and was granted access by the Law School to Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis to read the case law. Prof. Musheno, Director of the Legal Studies Program and Lecturer in Residence at Berkeley Law School, wrote that “It is in studying original writings generated over time and correlating these with changes in legal practices that make Mr. Burton’s thesis outstanding.”\n\nChristina Flores\n\nThey Rule the Valley: The Story of How Large Central Valley Landholders Became the Primary Beneficiaries of the Central Valley Project\n\nMs. Flores wrote her senior thesis in History on one aspect of 1940’s federal irrigation regulation in California’s Central Valley. She describes how the Valley’s largest landowners were able to use the Central Valley Project to their own advantage, despite the intentions of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which was managing the project. Ms. Flores used many different types of sources, including congressional hearings and reports, newspaper archives, and the Bancroft Library’s Paul S. Taylor Papers, among others. Kathryn Eigen, Ms. Flores’ thesis advisor, wrote that “Christina has never been satisfied with merely recounting events. Instead, she has worked and reworked her arguments to make them as clear as possible and to make the best use of the materials that she has found.”\n\nHelen Kim\n\n'I Miss Green:' A Comparison of Prison and Space Shuttle Design\n\nIn “‘I Miss Green:’ A Comparison of Prison and Space Shuttle Design”, Helen Kim examines the role of design in two disparate examples of confined space. Using materials available from Doe, Engineering, Environmental Design, Education-Psychology, and Moffitt libraries, as well as articles from numerous databases, she developed an annotated bibliography that allowed her to organize her comparison along three lines: general structure, psychological effects, and economic efficiency. Helen also took advantage of the Library’s Research Advisory Service and Chat Reference to assist her in exploring the “nature of architecture as a mediator of society’s thoughts and interactions.” In the words of her College Writing instructor, Helen’s paper is “an example of outstanding interdisciplinary work.”\n\nZachary O'Hagan\n\nProto-Omagua-Kokama: Grammatical sketch and prehistory\n\nMr. O’Hagan’s Lingustics honors thesis explores the history of several endangered Amazonian languages. He demonstrates that two of these languages, Omagua and Kokama, “were already distinct languages by the time the Jesuits arrived in the Amazon,” as his thesis advisor, Professor Lev Michael, writes. In addition to his fieldwork in Peru, Mr. O’Hagan made extensive use of collections on the Berkeley campus and at NRLF, corresponded with scholars in Europe and South America, and used Interlibrary Loan to access books and letters by early explorers and missionaries to the Amazon region. Professor Michael writes that “Quite simply, Zach increased by a factor of at least ten the amount of Old Omagua material known to linguists by his meticulous and creative searching through the Jesuit materials.”\n\nMark Rodgers\n\nTaste, Gender, and Nation in the Material Culture of Domestic Musical Performance: The Pocket Opera Anthology in England, 1724-6\n\nMark Rogers’s Honor’s Thesis, “Taste, Gender and Nation in the Material Culture of Musical Performance, the Pocket Opera Anthology in England 1724-6,” explores this “small but circumscribed genre of pocket books for gentlemen and ladies… primarily offering songs and arias from Italian operas” for performance by amateurs in domestic situations as apposed to the operatic stage. Despite admittedly sparse documentation on such private performances, Mark’s research was exhaustive, leading him to several libraries, including the Business Library to track down information about Italian businessmen in early 18th century London, and the Environmental Design Library to seek information on 18th century dress “(since the books were designed for pockets)”. Mark also used digital sources from Early English Books Online and Eighteenth-Century Collections Online, as well as availing himself of the rich resources in original 18th century editions in the Hargrove Music Library. Mark’s advisor, Prof. Davitt Moroney, calls his writing “mature and elegant, with intellectual subtlety and wit. He makes full use of all the resource available to him…like a professional scholar…. I am delighted by his vast and playful exploration of the non-musical dimensions of these pocket books, including questions of fashion, dress, iconography…and the all-pervasive issues of class and commerce with studies of print culture.” Prof. Moroney adds that “if the Prize is partly designed to identify young researchers who use library resources, and to encourage them as they go forward in their careers, working with library materials, then here is a truly exceptional candidate.”\n\nPreeti Talwai\n\nPraying through Politics, Ruling Through Religion: The Rajarajeswaram as an Instrument of Economic and Political Unification in the Chola Empire\n\nPreeti Talwai provides an original and multi-layered reading of the Rajarajeswaram temple in 11th century southern India. Through images and words, Preeti demonstrates how she drew from broad and specialized resources of the UC Berkeley Library (in many locations and formats) to construct an informed and engaging paper on the significance of one particular Hindu temple, built between 1003 and 1010 C.E., and during the apogee of the Chola Empire under Rajaran I. She made use of both OskiCat and Melvyl to search across Berkeley collections, and she used the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals, JSTOR, and other electronic article databases to gather both Western and Eastern perspectives on the Rajarajeswaram. The photographs and drawings which didactically and beautifully embellish her paper were scanned from books from the Environmental Design Library or discovered in the Library’s subscription to the ARTstor Digital Library. Preeti’s well-thought out and iterative research strategy included a careful analysis of the temple’s physical space based on primary visual sources, followed by searches for diverse interpretations in secondary literature. Not the likely location for architecture or primary sources on India, Preeti even consulted seminar archives that reside in the Bancroft Library to support her thesis that Rajaraja I combined architectural forms and structure with art, iconography, sculpture, and inscription to create a temple to Shiva that transcended the realm of Hinduism as it was known until his rule.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nCarina Boo\n\nThe Deterrable 'Undeterrables'\n\nCarina Boo’s timely Honorable Mention entry exemplifies the rewards of cultivating an open mind while studying the motivations of suicide bombers in Iraq. Ms. Boo’s work captures the complex voices and experiences of the suicide bombers themselves, as well as the outrage from the blogosphere. Her research began classically, with library databases and trips to the book stacks, then ranged outward through LexisNexis and on to videos of interviews with thwarted bombers. While in her process, she created a web site that organized her research, her notes, and all the components of the project. Her professor wrote, “… in the fourteen years I’ve been teaching first-year composition and research courses, this is the ONLY research project compiled by a student in one of my courses that has earned an A+.” Note should also be made of Ms. Boo’s annotated bibliography, which displays her careful evaluations of the reliability of her sources, and her thoughtful editorial comments. Congratulations to Ms. Boo for writing such a modulated and proficient research paper.\n\nCameron McKee\n\nVisual Anxiety: Deviant gender and depictions of the Jewish male during the Dreyfus Affair\n\nMcKee executed an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing methodologies of gender studies, art history, and cultural history to offer a new and focused study on one specific aspect of the Dreyfus Affair, a political scandal that divided France in the 1890s and the early 1900s. McKee argued that the Dreyfus Affair was a conduit through which the French articulated their social and political anxieties, including using the identity of Alfred Dreyfus as a Jewish man to reinforce those anxieties. Mr. McKee’s GSI, for whose course the paper was written, observes, “McKee’s use of foreign language newsprint, woodprints, contemporary sociological studies, and cartoons is superior; he is successful in his attempt to show how the Affair both fed and was the result of fear of French degeneration. [He] was able, with his strong knowledge of French and with the extensive resources available within the Berkeley system, to incorporate numerous sources that went beyond a typical undergraduate paper. Mr. McKee enlightened students in my seminar, revealing to others the strength of our library.”\n\nMelody Hung\n\nThree Anonymous French Seventeenth-Century Preludes from the 'Parville Manuscript'\n\nMelody Hung's paper undertakes an unusually in-depth investigation of three anonymous preludes for the harpsichord, for which unmeasured notation survives in the seventeenth-century French codex known as the Parville Manuscript. Ms. Hung has investigated the preludes' styles and conventional attributions by attending closely to their manuscript notations. Significantly, she has also researched Baroque improvisational techniques to reconstruct figured bass lines for each prelude as well as to perform compelling interpretations of them. Her professor comments, \"To achieve this unusual performance style required her to undertake a very considerable amount of reading and practice, learning from early modern treatises how to improvise in earlier styles. . . . This is a kind of musicology that is increasingly rare.\" Ms. Hung has made excellent use of early modern primary sources in both manuscript and facsimile, as well as electronic, printed, and microfilm sources from the Music Library's wide-ranging collection.\n\nAshanti Shih\n\nThe Tokai Reprocessing Issue: Japan’s Rise to Elite Nation Status in the 1970s\n\nMs. Shih's senior History thesis explores a diplomatic negotiation between the U.S. and Japan that took place over several months in 1977. At stake was whether a Japanese nuclear energy plant at Tokai would be allowed to reprocess spent fuel from the U.S. despite President Jimmy Carter's nonproliferation policy. Ms. Shih describes how resolution of the negotiations in Japan's favor contributed to its rise as an elite nation. Her investigation led her to books from Berkeley and other Berkeley campuses, the library's subscription to the Digital National Security Archives, and a research trip to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta. Professor Luke Franks writes that, \"Ms. Shih's undergraduate thesis is one of the finest I've ever encountered, and its success is in large part due to her understanding of the importance of primary source documentation, and her determination in seeking these out.\"\n\nWinners\n\nRyan Cohen\n\nClassroom for Improvement: How Decentralization Hinders Argentine Educational Equity\n\nMs. Cohen’s honors thesis examines the motives, methods and results of the decentralization of Argentina’s education system following the educational reforms of President Carlos Menem beginning in 1991. As a result, Argentina’s education policy was drastically altered in response to various stimuli in the political, social, and economic environment including globalization, economic hardship, and the pressure to conform to the neoliberalist ideology advocated by prominent world powers. She collects, analyzes, and synthesizes a wealth of information and data from a variety of sources in both English and Spanish. Prof. Karras notes, “This project paper could not have been done without the library’s help … moreover, she used librarians to make contacts at other organizations and in other schools on campus. [Her thesis] is exceptional [and] beautifully written.”\n\nTheresa Joy Hannig\n\nThe Inconstant Basilica of Constantine\n\nHannig’s paper examines this famous basilica’s several shifts in cultural significance from fourth-century Roman civic work to sixteenth-century Christian symbol. Her research follows the building’s many names over time—Temple of Peace, Palace of Romulus, New Basilica, and others—through materials held by a variety of research repositories, from our Environmental Design and Architecture Visual Resource libraries to the Royal collection at the British Library. Ms. Hannig’s GSI for whose course this essay was written, observes, “I consider both [Theresa’s] hypothesis and her research methods incredibly sophisticated, particularly for a second year Architecture major,” in part because the paper moves “beyond the level of sophistication and historical depth required for the course.” Also exceptional is Hannig’s “creative and rich use of images to develop and support her hypothesis,” with substantial examination via ARTstor, Spiro, and Oxford Art Online of paintings, photographs, architectural drawings, and digital reconstructions of both the basilica and the iconography of its ruins.\n\nRobin Lam\n\nPhotographing the Illusion of Austerity: Fashion Photography and Femininity in Post-WWII Britain\n\nRobin Lam’s senior thesis argues that fashion photography of the immediate postwar years in Britain has been overlooked because of the conservativeness of the images that characterized this period. In fact, however, these images reveal the social and economic conflicts within Britain at that time. Based on analyses of a wide variety of print and microfilm sources and image collections here and abroad, she shows how women’s attitudes in the postwar decade both fed the new ultra-feminine fashion and was fueled by photographic representations of that feminism. Ms. Lam’s advisor comments, “It is the first piece of scholarly work on the rise, dissemination, and uses of fashion photography in post-war Britain…. It is a testament to her ingenuity and industry that she has carved a paper out of a diverse range of sources,” including those she discovered during research trips to the British Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the British Film Institute.\n\nSimeon Newman\n\nYacreta’, Argentina’s White Elephant: Hydroelectric Development, International Capital, and Transnational Resistance\n\nSimeon Newman explores what was once touted as the largest development project ever undertaken by Argentina, the huge hydroelectric project on the Paraná River along the Argentina-Paraguay border, begun in the 1950s that neared completion in the early 1990s. He writes, “The project did end up providing a great deal of electricity to Argentina, … but the reservoir was filled only part way and the hydroelectricity plant only provided 60 percent of the electricity it was supposed to....\" Newman argues that the project failed because the people affected by the project did not allow it to be finished, \"a developmentalist dream that failed to live up to its promises.\" His professor comments that Newman wrote “a paper that is not only powerfully grounded in primary research, particularly of technical reports, disputes, and community mobilization against the dam and its effects, but also deeply informed by important theoretical works.” Newman made extensive use of the Water Resources Center Archives on campus, and interlibrary services to obtain material not at Berkeley.\n\nMatthew Rietfors\n\nPatriotism versus Principles: Perspectives on the Eve of the Mexican War\n\nMatthew Rietfors presents a very balanced and scholarly examination of the circumstances leading up to the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. He carefully describes the rationales that were offered in Congress both in support of, and against, the declaration of war which led to the annexation of considerable Mexican territory, including all of Texas, a substantial expansion of the future Confederacy, and a dramatic expression of our “manifest destiny.” Presenting the war as a definitive point in the history of the United States, Rietfors recognizes characteristic features in American foreign policy that have re-emerged in subsequent American debates contemplating such military actions. Rietfors’ instructors write, “This paper is based solidly on a careful reading of primary sources. He negotiated the vast resouces of the Bancroft Library efficiently and was able to maintain an unerring, deliberate focus on a serious question concerning US foreign relations during the first half of the 19th century.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nJessica Clark\n\nThe Chaco Allure: 150 Years of Archaeological Fascination with Pueblo Bonito\n\nJessica Clark's historiographical research project is an exploration of Pueblo Benito, an ancient Anasazi settlement nestled deep within Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. As Clark notes, “our interpretation of the ancient people and architecture is an ever-changing potpourri of thoughts and ideas applied by a variety of sources throughout time and space… leading to varying conclusions about the site and the inhabitants based on technology, methods of study, and contemporary contexts.” Her research led her, likewise, to a potpourri of library resources, both ancient and contemporary, spanning across the campus, and nestled deep within the stacks of the Environmental Design, Anthropology, Native American Studies, and Main libraries. Her skillful and elegant use of maps, aerial photographs, architectural diagrams, and other primary sources resulted in a strikingly rich and beautiful paper. Her GSI remarked that it “may represent original research not documented elsewhere.” In her own words, Clark’s perspective of the library evolved during the course of the project, changing from “a formidable army of infinite stacks” into “a gold mine of untapped potential.”\n\nLilian Fabela\n\nThe Legal Construction of Racial Identities through Anti-Miscegenation Laws and Court Cases in Arozona, 1865-1962\n\nRacism and the meaning of “whiteness,” marriage rights, the legal and social status of the “other” in Arizona: timely topics that are all touched upon in this History 101 paper. As Ms. Fabela’s advisor notes, her original contributions to the study of race and law are twofold: First, most existing scholarly work on miscegenation law focuses on the South; this paper’s focus on Arizona brings a unique regional context to this subject, addressing the impact of the laws on persons of Mexican descent who were assumed to be “white” in Arizona. Secondly, miscegenation laws in Arizona, rather than serving to police intermarriage, were in fact little more than a tool used by ordinary people for their personal interests in matters of divorce, inheritance, and the like. Fabela’s research took her to Arizona State University’s Law Library and Arizona State Library, Archives, and Public Records. She also utilized the Bancroft and numerous electronic resources provided by the UC Berkeley Library. The resulting paper, her advisor notes, is “original, deeply researched, and important.”\n\nMiriam Paula Rubenson\n\n‘The Purity of the Ballot Box’: How Ex-felons Won the Right to Vote in California, 1966-1974\n\nRubenson's senior thesis explores the legal and political situation in California leading up to the passage of Proposition 10, which restored voting rights to convicted felons who had completed their prison terms. She made extensive use of primary sources in her research, traveling to the California State Archives in Sacramento on a History Department grant and studying materials from the Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Institute archives at Bancroft Library. Through these primary sources, Ms. Rubenson is able to demonstrate that, unlike in other states and contrary to popular belief, the abolition of felon disenfranchisement in California was achieved not through an appeal to racial equality, but via a surprisingly legalistic debate about equal protection and uniformity before the law. In high praise of her work, Prof. Einhorn writes that \"Only a sensitive, flexible, and intellectually alert approach to her primary sources could have produced this original and interesting finding.\"\n\nAlexandra Title\n\nA comparative study of Scleractinian coral diversity in Mo’orea, French Polynesia, and the Great Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nMs. Title’s project studies “island biogeography in the Pacific showing a biodiversity level that decreases from west to east.” Having “an increased knowledge on coral diversity patterns and dispersal can help focus conservation efforts to preserve maximum biodiversity and protect coral reefs from adverse human impact.” She did most of her library research from the field, using proxy connections on remote, tiny islands in the Pacific to access online databases. According to Prof. Mishler, “Alex was one of the very top students in this class, and that is saying a lot because it is a very select group chosen based on their records and interviews… Alex showed unusual creativity and perseverance in eventually finding excellent comparison studies [in an area where it is] difficult to find comparable data in the literature.”\n\nWinners\n\nChristine Russell\n\n\"We Don't Scare Easily\": The Gary Case and Housing Discrimination in Richmond, CA, 1952\n\nChristine Russell’s senior thesis \"We Don't Scare Easily\": The Gary Case and Housing Discrimination in Richmond, Ca, 1952, documents the extreme white opposition towards the Gary family’s move into Rollingwood, a previously all-white Richmond subdivision. In her paper, Christine explores how the police upheld the law in theory, but not in practice, and the importance of the NAACP and community support in supporting the Garys in their fight to remain in their home. The Newspapers/Microforms collection in Doe was essential to Christine’s research with access to the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune and black-owned newspapers like the Sun-Reporter. Even the Communist Party’s Daily People’s World reported on the Gary case. Christine also found an oral history from the Regional Oral History Office and the NAACP archives at Bancroft to be crucial to her report. However, the most important source was a personal interview Christine arranged with Constance Gary, a child of the Gary’s. Christine’s advisor writes “Ms. Russell has written a well conceived, thoughtfully argued, and compelling essay that showcases not only the range of our local and national NAACP collections, but also the strength of the West Coast branch office as evidenced in their files in particular.”\n\nJaimee Comstock-Skipp\n\nWhose Painted Reality? Redefining Orientalism in British Representations of the Sultan Hasan Mosque in Cairo\n\nJaimee Comstock Skipp’s honors thesis, “Whose Painted Reality? Redefining Orientalism in British Representations of the Sultan Hasan Mosque in Cairo, led her from Berkeley to London to Egypt. Aided by travel grants, Jaimee was able to view key works in London museums and archives and then by traveling to Egypt, see the actual sites depicted in the artworks. Jaimee ultimately concentrated her research efforts on the Sultan Hasan Mosque as it was the site where she had both “a profusion of nineteenth century artistic responses” and physical access. Back in Berkeley, Jaimee found published travelogues from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries at Bancroft and the Environmental Design Library that helped to contextualize the artwork in their time period. Her paper’s final selection of images “invites the reader to look at this large corpus from numerous sources never before grouped together.” Jaimee’s advisor writes, “Jamiee’s contribution extends beyond the limits of art history, for the nuanced sensibility and expanded theoretical approach that she argues for will inform studies not only of Orientalist art in the future, but also all fields related to Near Eastern studies, from history to literature to the social sciences.”\n\nJesse Hoffman\n\nA Family of Prophets in 2nd Century Roman Egypt\n\nJesse Hoffman researched five Greek-language papyri from Roman Egypt for his Classics Honors course in classical civilization (H195) for his project, A Family of Prophets in 2nd Century Roman Egypt . Four of the five papyri which were related to a known family archive and the fifth was unrelated but of the same time period. Of the five, three were in The Center for the Tebtunis Papyri (CTP) at the Bancroft; one was in the Beinecke Library (Yale) and the other in the Lunds universitetsbibliotek (Sweden). Jesse first deciphered the handwriting of each document and then created a working transcript of the Greek text. Once he had the transcription, the translation was next, and finally, an analysis of the translated text. In the process of translation and analysis, Jesse searched the Duke Database of Documentary Papyri (DDDP) to find references to relevant published papyri. Through the collections in Doe and Art History/Classics, he was able to locate and study these publications. These resources along with searches of JSTOR and the Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists were essential for his in-depth analysis of the translated text. According to his advisor, “Mr. Hoffman’s senior thesis is a “remarkable piece of professional research. The fact that it is nearly ready for peer-reviewed publication is testament to the rigor with which Mr. Hoffman used the library resources here at Berkeley and at other institutions.”\n\nMark Mallery\n\nMarijuana National Forest: Encroachment on California Lands for Cannabis Cultivation\n\nMark Mallery’s, honor’s thesis, Marijuana National Forest: Encroachment on California Lands for Cannabis Cultivation, began as an environmental problem-solving term paper and as he says, it “turned into an honors thesis and long term public education project.” Mark explored his topic from all perspectives including legal propositions, scholarly research and environmental assessment field notes. When he exhausted these sources, he identified key experts and interviewed them to gather information crucial to the research project. In the process, Mark has produced a thorough review of the topic, including proposals for policies that could change current trends in marijuana production on public lands. Mark’s thesis advisor writes that “Mark has taken many very complex issues that cover a wide range of legal, social and environmental issues and developed a concise and well written thesis.”\n\nKelly Fabian\n\nDissecting Andreas Vesalius's Epitome\n\nKelly Fabian’s enthusiasm for Renaissance art was the spark that caused her to request Andreas Vesalisus’s Epitome from the Bancroft vault for her Undergraduate Seminar on Archival Research project. The Epitome, a monument in the history of printing and culture, was published in 1543 as an anatomy textbook for medical students. Kelly says she was immediately “hooked” when she held the item; its size and image quality were impressive. She adds, “Even better, the pages were stained with the memories of dissections long ago, something I found simultaneously revolting and fascinating.” In her research paper Kelly focuses on the image of the female cadaver on the title page and relates it to the role of the female form in renaissance art. In addition to the Bancroft Library, Kelly found resources through the Art History, Classics and Bioscience Libraries to support her analysis that Vesalius was attempting to probe the secret of human creation in his dissection of the female reproductive organs. Kelly’s advisor writes that she “brought her own perspective, as a student of Renaissance art, and as a modern young woman, to bear on the analysis of the drawings. In them, she deciphers much more than the important anatomical details they were created primarily to depict.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nBenjamin Zumwalt\n\nInterracial Coalitions in the United Farm Workers: The Filipino Experience\n\nBenjamin Zumwalt documented the Filipino farm workers unionization experiences, and explored how Filipinos were marginalized within the United Farm Workers union for his Ethnic Studies 195 class, in his project, Interracial Coalitions in the United Farm Workers: The Filipino Experience. While much has been written on the UFW, little is available from the Filipino point of view. However, with persistence Ben was able to find a number of sources including the oral history of Phillip Vera Cruz, a Filipino union organizer, and the Bancroft papers of BerkeleyB Professor Paul S. Taylor, one of the first scholars to study migrant farm workers. Ben also used the Mexican-American newsletters in the Ethnic Studies Library and the Filipino newspapers in the Newspaper Room in Doe. As part of his critical analysis of the events, Ben even analyzed census data to look at population trends in Kern and Delano counties in the 1960s and 1970s. Ben’s faculty advisor wrote that “Zumwalt chose a challenging research question, and I believe he did a remarkable job given the ten weeks he has worked on this.”\n\nJessica Walters\n\nThe Winds of Change: How a Group of Alaska Native Aleuts Became a Community of United States Citizens\n\nJessica Walters was originally interested in the forced internment of the Aleuts during World War II, but while researching the evacuation, she learned that the Aleuts had been essentially treated as wards of the United States government from 1867 to 1985. Intrigued, she expanded her paper from the three-year internment to this much more complex relationship for her History 101 project, Winds of Change: How a Group of Alaska Native Aleuts Became a Community of United States Citizens. Jessica used a wide range of library resources in including the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Citizens on microfiche in Bancroft, and from the Alaska Digital archives, the daily records of United States agents sent to administer the islands from 1890-1942, as well as many photographs of daily life on the islands. Jessica supplemented these primary resources with books and journal articles about the Pribilof Aleuts, including accounts of early Russian expeditions to the islands to document a long-term suppression of the native culture and language. “Despite these abuses, the Aleuts today celebrate and honor both their native heritage and their American identity. According to Jessica’s advisor, “There is very little written on the Aleuts in general, and nothing on the period and themes she has chosen; her paper is truly an original piece of research.”\n\nSarah L. Fong\n\nChanging Familial Roles in Doi Moi Vietnamese Literature\n\nSarah Fong’s project for her SEA 10 class, “Changing Familial Roles in Doi Moi Vietnamese Literature developed from an observation she made while studying data from the United Nations on urban migration patterns. Sarah noticed that a pattern in the increased number of women entering the workforce and the increased age at which women were marrying in modern day Vietnam. This observation coupled with the short stories read in class, shifted Sarah’s focus from migration to modern literature and the changing family structure in Vietnam as a result of Doi Moi (the economic reforms initiated by Vietnam in 1986). By using a variety of library resources, Sarah was able to find examples of contemporary Vietnamese literature (in English) and numerous secondary sources on Vietnam under Doi Moi. Sarah’s advisor writes that “In her essay, Sarah Fong deftly navigates between literature and politics, links cultural production and the political economy and highlights the power of literature as a lens on swiftly changing familial relations and expectations in a Vietnam transitioning to a market economy.”\n\nSheel Jagani\n\nCommodities and Machines at Work in Surrogate Motherhood\n\nSheel Jagani’s idea for a research project for Anthropology 115 began to coalesce when she realized that a class topic on organ trafficking raised many of the same issues she wanted to explore about surrogacy. Using philosophies of Michael Taussig and Michel Foucault that were discussed in class, Sheel’s paper, Commodities and Machines at Work in Surrogate Motherhood, explores the ethical and legal implications of surrogacy when one treats the womb and child as commodities. Sheel uncovered a wide variety of resources from multiple disciplines on reproductive technology using the Doe, Moffitt and Anthropology libraries, but her paper took a new direction when she discovered Doe’s transcripts of legislative hearings, and was able to add a legal dimension to her arguments. Sheel’s advisor says “The paper itself engages with several different threads of analyst and reveals Sheel’s potential to develop her own unique authorial voice. In a young scholar like Sheel, these are rare traits indeed.”\n\nWinners\n\nMy Chau\n\nThe Power of Patterns: Double Ikat for Textile Exhange in India and Indonesia\n\nIn her honors thesis entitled The Power of Patterns: Double Ikat for Textile Exchange in India and Indonesia, My Chau argues that patola textile has an international appeal across India and Indonesia. She highlights two distinctive textiles: Patola in Gujarat, India and geringsing in Bali, Indonesia from the perspective of \"religious, economic and social systems.\" Her thesis further explores the preservation and the sacred and elite status of patola in various kinds of powder, temple, and palace paintings in Kerala, India. My Chau’s research was conducted through a visual analysis of a geringsing textile in the Musee de Quai Branly in Paris during her study abroad program in fall 2006 and the Gujarati patola textile in the Phoebe Hearst Museum as well as 48 illustrations cited in her thesis. To enrich her primary sources research, she followed up with scholars for more research inquiries in addition to checking out BerkeleyB library resources and requesting interlibrary loan items. Her thesis advisor in the History of Art Department comments that My Chau’s honors thesis \"showed originality, intellectual imagination, and good judgment to produce a plausible new historical and cultural picture. Were she enabled to conduct fieldwork in Gujarat, Kerala, and Bali, this paper could readily be published.\"\n\nLinda Marie Nyberg\n\nThe Collapse of Time: Decennial Anniversaries and the Experience of Time in the German Democratic Republic\n\nLinda Nyberg’s project, her senior thesis for her History 101 class, discusses the collective experience of time and its control and codification by the German Democratic Republic. She chose decennial celebrations of the birth of the GDR to represent how time was manipulated by the government, in response to the realities of everyday life in the GDR. After surveying Berkeley’s primary and secondary literature on her topic, Linda continued her research at the Hoover Archives. Then, funded by a history department travel grant, Linda visited Berlin and spent weeks examining \"...official anniversary publications, pamphlets, Free German Youth brochures, news clips, memoirs, [and] newspaper articles....\" After returning, she discovered a key resource in the Doe stacks, that allowed her to synthesize her ideas. She says, \"I had been to Stanford and to Berlin and back, yet there it was, gathering dust on a Doe library shelf.\" Linda’s advisor also credits the Doe Library source, as the one resource \"...that gave her a way to combine the disparate media sources that she had collected.\" He states that \"Linda has an original, provocative argument and convincingly places the study within the secondary literature on everyday life in the GDR, anti-fascist ideology, and the social history of time.\"\n\nKeith Orejel\n\nBodies, Burials, and Black Cultural Politics: African American Funerals in the Civil Rights Movement\n\nKeith Orejel’s History 101 project grew out of his interest in death, violence, and social movements. Keith spent six weeks doing primary source research at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. After realizing the quantity of material to be found at the Library of Congress, Keith narrowed his project to four major funerals of the Civil Rights Movement: those of Emmett Till; Medgar Evers; the four girls killed in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley; and Martin Luther King, Jr. In Washington, Keith explored primary sources of major Civil Rights organizations, finding pamphlets, flyers, and correspondence related to his topic; he also used the Kennedy and Johnson presidential files. At BerkeleyB, Keith used the Library’s electronic bibliographic resources to find secondary sources, and made extensive use of the Library’s collection of African American newspapers. He says that the research process \"...taught me many new skills and techniques for working with archives. I not only learned how to navigate a complex institution like the LOC, but how to find a wide panoply of primary sources that could be sculpted into a coherent final product.\" One of Keith’s faculty advisors says, \"A remarkable feature of the paper is the sophistication with which it looks at the internal dynamics of these funerals.\" His other mentor says \"Richly primary source based, Keith’s thesis is also sophisticatedly secondary source informed…..he advances a nuanced and imaginative argument about the ironic trajectory of what he refers to as the 'black cultural politics of death.' \"\n\nCarine de la Girond’arc and Alina Xu\n\nThe Comics of R. Crumb: A Mirror of the Artist’s Times and Obsessions\n\nThe original idea for Carine de la Girond’arc and Alina Xu ‘s Archival Research class paper was to provide a comparative analysis of several cartoon artists. When they discovered that the Bancroft, and Doe and Moffitt libraries, hold a significant collection of R. Crumb’s comics, the current project developed. In it, Alina and Carine decided to focus on the forces driving Crumb’s work and to put it into a personal and political context. They used several different sources, including visual media, newspapers and magazines, and interviews with friends and contemporaries of R. Crumb. In the process, they say, \"We also discovered the value of creativity in conducting original research and immense satisfaction to be had in going out and discovering new sources of information. We learned something from every source we investigated, even those explored on a whim...\". Their faculty advisors say, \"For us, the most compelling aspect of the paper is its lively evocation of a highly creative artist who reflects his time and place (including Berkeley and the counterculture) with startling originality....And, like Crumb himself, the authors handle a variety of materials and themes that are unusual and controversial with independence and confidence.\"\n\nWinners\n\nCécile Evers\n\nSlave Language Acquisition in the 18th Century, Gobernación of Chocó, Colombia\n\nCécile Evers' research project, Slave Language Acquisition in the 18th Century, Gobernación of Chocó, Colombia, was developed as an honors thesis for her International and Area Studies 102 course. Her paper tackles an intriguing question that has largely been sidestepped in recent ethno-linguist debates: Why were Creole languages-those languages resulting from prolonged contact between indigenous peoples and European colonists-consistently absent from Spanish colonies in the Americas? Cécile's particular focus of study was on the plantation and mining zones in the Choco region of Colombia. In addition to exploring the rich collections of primary and secondary materials in the Berkeley library, her research included a five-week visit to Colombia. During this time she scoured the archives of the Colombian National Library and several privately-held collections, along with consulting with Colombian scholars and researchers on her topic. This research abroad has both informed and expanded her continuing work in the Berkeley library upon her return. Her advisor in the History Department notes that Cécile's project has \"the makings of an ambitious doctoral dissertation, but even a preliminary entry of the kind [she] achieves is suggestive and fruitful, thanks to her knowledge of languages…[her] resourcefulness in tracking down sources and informants, and her understanding of the issues at stake. She has the basis for a significant entry into…[a]contested field of study [and] has been invited to present her findings to an international symposium in Amsterdam-a wonderful opportunity for her and an affirmation of the importance of the project and promise of her work.\"\n\nAshley Aubuchon\n\nA Means to an End: The Role of Religion in Eastern State Penitentiary during 'The Experiment'\n\nIn her History 101 project entitled A Means to an End: The Role of Religion in Eastern State Penitentiary during 'The Experiment', Ashley Aubuchon investigates the crucial and novel ways in which religion helped to define the rhetoric of prison experience, as well as a substantial part of the prison experience itself in Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary between the years of 1829 and 1849. Her project makes ample and effective use of some of the more obscure and fascinating primary resources in the Doe Library, the Environmental Design Library, and Boalt Library, including annual reports of the Penitentiary inspectors and chaplains, state penal statutes, articles in contemporary journals and newspapers, and various accounts of contemporary visitors to the prison, including Charles Dickens and Alexis de Tocqueville. Her advisor praises Ashley's \"fine and evolving historical sensibility,\" her \"ability to carve out of this massive body of material a well-designed and very smart historical essay,\" and her ability to find her \"own historiographical and critical voice within a variety of literatures.\"\n\nMichael Uy\n\nThe Baroque Viola and Improvisational Style\n\nFor his Music 195 honors project, The Baroque Viola and Improvisational Style, Michael Uy, a viola player himself, attempted to solve an intriguing historical and artistic puzzle regarding the role of his instrument in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: although violas often participated in larger ensembles during this period, there are no parts written for them by composers. So what did viola players play? In order to solve this riddle, Michael plunged into secondary and primarily literature on the baroque viola. Perhaps most central to his research was the discovery of the Tartini Collection, an important collection of nearly 3000 unique and unpublished manuscripts of 18th Century Italian string music. Michael used this collection to analyze when and how composers used viola parts during the Baroque era. To aid him in his research, Michael took the remarkable step of acquiring a baroque viola and bow in order to participate in the University Baroque Ensemble. His advisor comments that purchasing the instrument \"is comparable to a scientist acquiring the technical equipment related to a specific piece of research in the lab,\" and that playing in the Ensemble has served as a \"larger living laboratory for his experiments.\" As an offshoot of his research in the Tartini collection, Michael became interested in a rare, mid-18th Century score by Vincenzo Marcelli and transcribed the original notation into modern musical notation. He is preparing to perform the piece with the Ensemble. His advisor has noted that \"In this way, a musical work preserved in the BerkeleyB Library, a piece that has lain dormant for hundreds of years, will now receive its first modern performance…and will be ready for publication.\n\nSarah Stoller\n\nAmos n' Andy: Revolution or Regression: Controversy and the Formation of African American Identity\n\nSarah Stoller's project entitled Amos n' Andy: Revolution or Regression: Controversy and the Formation of African American Identity was done for her History 7B class this semester. In the paper, Sarah investigates the development of the popular Amos n' Andy radio series created and performed by white actors Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll in the 1930s and 40s, as well as the 1950s television show based on this series. She investigates the varying responses of both the white and African American communities to these shows, focusing particularly on the various protests against the stereotypical characters in the show that arose in the black press at the time. To develop her paper, Sarah utilized a wide variety of primary sources, including documentary film, videos of the television show, radio recreations of the series, and an extensive array of articles found in African American newspapers such as the Chicago Defender and Abbott's Monthly. Her graduate student instructor for the course has commented that \"For many students in lower division survey courses…this type of research can seem wholly daunting. I have found that most students are able to work through those concerns and meet the requirements, but few approach the project wholeheartedly, seeking not simply to meet requirements, but to find their own way to make history tangible. Sarah Stoller, in her first year at UC Berkeley, is already one of those students.\"\n\nWinners\n\nSuzan Sabyl Cohen\n\nChallenges of Enforcing Group Rights in a Common-law Setting\n\nSuzan Sabyl Cohen’s paper, written while she was enrolled in the UC Berkeley Washington Program, explores how legal theory and practice inform each other, in the context of the 1982 Canadian constitutional provisions protecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Cohen writes: “I began my research broadly. I looked for books that would provide me with a thorough introduction to theories of multiculturalism, indigenous rights, and international law. Because the focus of my research was on Canadian indigenous claims, I also did web research on relevant law cases on the website for the Supreme Court of Canada…I also needed to find relevant law review articles that addressed the legal theories of indigenous claims. Lexis-Nexis and Hein Online, databases I could remotely access at the Berkeley library, proved to be invaluable resources to me. I also found using the footnotes from existing sources to be invaluable tools in finding additional sources for my research.” Dr. Goldstein notes of Cohen’s work that: “The paper required analysis of obscure Canadian lower court decisions and the proceedings and controversies surrounding them. It was additionally a new topic, generated by Canada’s recent adherence to an international treaty…the paper could not have been done without the creative and sophisticated use of worldwide library resources. [In addition to using various libraries in Washington, D.C., Canada, and Berkeley] Sabyl also used her contacts at the Woodrow Wilson Center, on the Berkeley faculty, and at the Berkeley Washington Center to identify scholars who may be working on her topic or in tangential areas. She then used library resources to identify published work by these scholars.”\n\nWael El-Nachef\n\nCarbon Monoxide and Waterpipe Smoking in a College-Setting\n\nWael El-Nachef's senior honors thesis presents his study of carbon monoxide exposures in waterpipe smoking, including the results of a protocol he designed that sampled air for carbon monoxide levels in hookah cafes. El-Nachef reflects that: “A crucial element of conducting thesis research is learning how to learn. This fundamental education began last summer, when I started conducting PubMed searches on waterpipe smoking. To my surprise, I identified only twelve articles on this topic. Compared to the thousands of studies on cigarettes, my search yields were startling. I consulted a librarian who taught me many techniques to improve my PubMed search…The improved search still yielded only 40 articles, reflecting the dearth of information on waterpipe smoking. It became imperative that I access all the information available, synthesize what was known…, and decide what areas should be explored. For example, when I found there were no studies on the waterpipe coals, I studied charcoal in general; when I found no research on the health effects from waterpipe-produced carbon monoxide, I studied a doctoral thesis on low-level carbon monoxide exposure.” He adds, “the work of science is not simply the measurement of observations--it is also imperative that scientists recognize the body of knowledge that precedes them and evaluate this knowledge before designing an experiment. The library system has helped me fulfill this critical duty by not only providing candid and multifaceted access to diverse and obscure articles, but by also educating me in how to best access these articles.” Noting that El-Nachef's initial work informed her own work with WHO, Professor Hammond observes that: “For his research Wael is using dozens of original scientific articles in the peer-reviewed literature, government documents…, health alerts, unpublished doctoral dissertations, and commercial product information …. He has found these through systematic review with multiple electronic search engines, tracing references in each article and using the citation literature to track articles others have written which cite key articles he has identified. He has obtained the original scientific articles electronically from the UCB library web site, from the printed journals directly when they were not available electronically, by visiting multiple libraries, and through interlibrary loan…[H]e has learned to read this literature and to synthesize it with his own observations, which continue to become more sophisticated with this knowledge….”\n\nBreeanna Fujio\n\nThe Salton Sea: Forgotten Origins\n\nFreshman Breeanna Fujio’s paper explores the early twentieth century transformation of California’s Salton Basin into the Salton Sea. Regarding her research, Fujio notes: “Pictures were the first magic I discovered. My initial strategy was to search for ‘Salton Sea’ on Pathfinder, which brought up the Giffen Collection of photographs (dated 1905). I found them stunning in the clichéd ‘window through time’ sort of way…I then went to the internet to search for some general information on the Salton Sea from 1906…Which led me to a great discovery: these exact pictures were included in an on-line copy of The Periscope written by a woman named Pat Laflin…I…was amazed to learn that she had in fact conducted the majority of her research at the Bancroft Library and had seen the same pictures I had so recently discovered.” Professor Casey notes that in developing her project, Fujio “quickly found relevant secondary sources in Doe Library and some photographs at Bancroft… Breeanna tracked down an impressive variety of sources concerning the region known variously as the Salton Basin, the Salton Sink, and after 1905 as the Salton Sea. A crucial turning point in her research was the chance discovery of a living writer on the subject…whom Breeanna was able to meet through the Coachella Valley Historical Society.\n\nCamille Pannu\n\nClass, Identity, and Political Solidarity Among British Blacks\n\nCamille Pannu’s senior honors thesis examines the social, political, and economic factors underlying the experiences of two ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom, in order to understand declining participation in the British antiracist movement. Pannu notes about her research experience, “I learned to weed through online search engines to pull graphic information from think tanks, national libraries, and community-funded databases…I learned that the British Library housed the only collection of British ethnic newspaper archives…After applying for funding from several sources, I traveled to London for two weeks to complete my research at the British Library in addition to interviewing local anti-racist NGOs.” She adds, “Despite the challenges and frustrations inherent in engaging meaningfully in research for the first time, I learned how to organize both my approach and my thoughts. I quickly realized that I couldn’t simply walk in, spend a few minutes browsing through catalogues, and then retrieve everything I hoped to find…Throughout this the library has become my lab, an incubator for my ideas and a medium within which I have been able to shape my academic vision.” Lecturer Karras notes that: “Her working hypothesis changed over the course of her research and, while in libraries and at conferences in the UK, she discovered that her assumptions going into the paper were completely wrong. She used, in other words, the libraries to disprove her hyposthesis. Her argument, as a result, is at once strong and clear—and very well grounded in evidence.”\n\nAndrew Strauss\n\nPuissant Pedagogies: Building a Colonial School in French Morocco, 1920-25\n\nIn his senior honors thesis, Andrew Strauss explores colonial and indigenous educational institutions in French Morocco as a means of understanding French assumptions about Islamic education and the ability of French colonial institutions to educate Moroccans. Strauss observes that: \"My experience at the library consistently challenged my notions of the research process. I learned that some research questions, while attractive, were not feasible. This lesson came as a result of my extensive perusal of secondary and primary sources, and the lacunae in the written records which I encountered…Working with the Library's diverse holdings taught me to adopt a flexible, interdisciplinary approach to research. The most enriching conclusions, in my experience, could spring from the most unlikely of sources. After writing this thesis, I recognized that the perceptions of a cross-cultural psychologist could be as relevant to my work as those of a fellow historian.\" Professor Sahlins adds, \"Andrew was never content…merely to research the European side of things, although he did so extremely well, providing a number of important insights. Indeed, his work with the French journal Hesperis, which he was fortunate to locate at Doe, gave him the central sources about French pedagogical practices in Morocco. More critically, he wanted to find out more about indigenous Arabic modes of pedagogy, and sought out primary materials in the library collections. Among his discoveries was an Arabic historical novel from which he creatively interpolated important elements of Arabic pedagogy.\"\n\nAndrina Tran\n\nThe Paradox of Cultural Exchange: a 'Kitchen Debate' at the 1959 American National Exhibition\n\nIn 1959 U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet Union Premier Nikita Kruschev sat down to talk in the model kitchen exhibit of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. Freshman Andrina Tran’s paper examines the ideological and cultural setting of the spontaneous and sometimes heated conversation that ensued, known as the “Kitchen Debate.” Commenting on one strand of her research process, Tran observes: “I was…able to locate the official exhibition pamphlet released by the Office of Public Information. In direct contrast to frank government viewpoints and scholarly analyses, this pamphlet, meant for public consumption, revealed the fair’s every feature while trumpeting its supposed political neutrality. It soon appeared to me that the fair itself served a clear ideological purpose, so researching its little-known context and details would enhance my understanding of the political pressures surrounding the ‘kitchen debate.’” Also, “through Nixon’s memoirs and various newspaper articles, I tried to determine whether events preceding Nixon’s visit may have contributed to the tempers that flared during the debate. Then, since no verbatim transcript of the debate exists, I searched for rough outlines in newspapers, magazines, and Nixon’s own account. The challenge was reconciling different versions to grasp the essential argument.” GSI McEnroe adds: “Her methods demonstrate sensitivity to the difficulties of understanding the relationship between the planning, staging, and public reception of this sort of political event…Andrina’s composition is so skillful that it at times conceals the complexity of the underlying research, but a close reading of the footnotes tells the story of her work.”\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nDorothy Couchman\n\nReading Jonson"
