        "text": "This paper is a comparative ecocritical investigation considering the relationship between man and nature in cross-cultural contexts as reflected in the poetry of two great admirers of nature in England and Malaysia: William Wordsworth and Ghulam Sarwar Yousuf. Both poets have composed poetry that strengthens man's bonds with nature and inspires environmental consciousness. Their nature poetry has been previously studied from different individual perspectives, but none has approached it comparatively from an ecocritical stylistic viewpoint. This study aims at analyzing selected nature poetry to identify the unique philosophy of nature both poets adopted, highlighting the artistic and aesthetic values their poetry are teeming with. The study demonstrates the cognitive development of the poets' environmental consciousness through three phases of attitudes towards nature; the physical, the intellectual and the mystical. Using major ecocritical concepts like ecocentrism, symbiotic interrelationship and ecological consciousness, the study adopts a comparative stylistic approach to scrutinize linguistic and literary representation of nature in the selected poems. It identifies the similarities and differences between both poets concluding that despite differences in their times, places, cultures, language and style, there is an affinity between both poets in their treatment towards nature. The present study responds to the enormous need for literary-linguistic investigation of leitmotifs of nature across geographical, cultural, and linguistic contexts as a means of facilitating environmental sensitivity and sensibility.\n\nThe focus of research study is to explore the bond between man and nature, reflected in the poetry of contemporary Pakistani Pashto poet Abdul Ghani Khan. The nature poetry of the poet reinforces man's connection to nature and promotes environmental awareness. His poetry has been analyzed previously from various viewpoints, but little work has been done from ecocritical and stylistic perspective. This research seeks to examine selected nature's poetry from the poetic collection of the poet to recognize the concept of nature that he has embraced, as well as the creative and artistic qualities that his poetry contains. The paper also shows the poet's environmental consciousness that has developed cognitively involving three phases: physical, intellectual, and mystical. The thesis also examines the linguistic and literary styles in the selected poetry, using the Eco critical notions like eco centrism, symbiotic interrelatedness, and ecological consciousness. The current research addresses the critical need for literary-linguistic research into nature motifs for promotion of environmental awareness and sensibility.\n\nIn the face of global ecological decline, the main obstacles to action continue to be collective inertia, inattention and disconnection. Yet words chosen with art can electrify our senses and ignite the imagination needed to envision and create a different world. It is not a coincidence if we turn to poetry in the hardest times: poetry responds to a deep need to reconnect, to mend and heal broken relationships, including with the planet. Poetry carries deep ecological relevance. The aim of this chapter is to show that poetry is uniquely positioned to pierce through societal inertia because poetry can enhance ecological awareness, that is, awareness of our deep entanglements with the planet. Ecological awareness is the foundational, necessary condition for ecological action. The chapter draws on recent debates on the concept of ecological awareness in environmental humanities (including contributions by anthropologist Tim Ingold and philosopher Tim Morton) and on the efficacy of poetic structures (such as metaphors and synesthesia) in order to advance the argument that poetry is ecology. Methodologically, the chapter proposes a ‘poetic methodology’ based on full participation, attention and affective involvement of the reader /writer. These theoretical and methodological perspectives are grounded in the work of Italian (Friulian) poet Pierluigi Cappello. The analysis of extracts from Cappello’s poems traces a path of ecological awareness that originates in the reawakening of the senses, and through decentering of the human being, grounding, and accepting responsibility for our actions, points to the way ahead towards ecological healing and hope. Keywords: ecological awareness; relationship; attention; affect; poetic methodology.\n\nThe full text is available here http://kata.petra.ac.id/index.php/ing/article/view/18851/18544 Many similar subjects can be traced in world literature; among them is nature since it belongs to man/nature binary opposition. The American poet and philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) employs nature in his works. Throughout his works, the American writer discusses the affinity between man and nature, emphasizing how man takes advantage of it. The contemporary Iranian poet, Sohrab Sepehri (1928-1980), also makes intensive use of nature in his poems; his interest in the subject increases along with his tendency to Buddhism. Sepehri is proficient in using nature either in philosophical or emotional issues. Due to the significance of nature in the works or the two figures, an ecocritical reading of them is not only applicable but unavoidable. This comparative study aims at investigating different approaches towards nature employed by the two poets, emphasizing their points of difference. Although both poets employ nature in their works with romantic tendencies, the postmodern environmental ethics of Sepehri is in direct contrast to the instrumental value viewpoint held by his American counterpart."
