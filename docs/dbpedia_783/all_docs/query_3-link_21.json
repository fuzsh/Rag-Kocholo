        "text": "Christopher Isherwood Prize\n\nMonsters: A Fan's Dilemma\n\nClaire Dederer\n\nBestselling author and essayist Claire Dederer is the winner of the 2023 Christopher Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose for “Monster: A Fan’s Dilemma,” which expands on her popular 2017 essay in the Paris Review titled “What Do We Do with the Art of Monstrous Men?” Sponsored by the Christopher Isherwood Foundation, the award honors exceptional work and encompasses fiction, travel writing, memoir and diary. “Monsters” explores the problematic relationship between masculinity and fame, and considers how we come to love art made by less than perfect humans. Dederer engages the essayist form at its best and the result is both critical, literary and provocative. We can love art despite hating the artist, Dederer’s breathtaking sentences argue, but it always comes with a cost.\n\nInnovator's Award\n\nAccess Books\n\nThe 2023 Innovator’s Award, which spotlights efforts to bring books, publishing and storytelling into the future, will be presented to Access Books. The nonprofit organization will be honored for its work renovating school libraries and ensuring that underserved students and communities have access to quality literacy resources. The work Access Books does in creating comfortable and welcoming environments for students to explore literacy and the world of books is incredibly important and has lasting effects. We are thrilled to honor Access Books with the Innovator’s Award as it continues to improve libraries in the communities that need it the most.\n\nRobert Kirsch Award\n\nJane Smiley\n\nJane Smiley, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “A Thousand Acres,” is the 2023 Robert Kirsch Award recipient. The award recognizes a writer with a substantial connection to the American West. In addition to being an accomplished novelist, L.A-born Smiley has written short fiction, nonfiction and several books for young adults. Whether it's her epic reimagining of King Lear in 'A Thousand Acres,' exploring campus life at Moo University in the hilarious 'Moo,' or her insightful writing about her beloved horses for readers of all ages, Smiley's work brings a deeper understanding of the American landscape and the people (and creatures) that inhabit it. Amongst her acclaimed works are “The Greenlanders” and the Last Hundred Years Trilogy: “Some Luck,” “Early Warning” and “Golden Age.” She has received countless accolades during her career, including the PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Award for Literature."
