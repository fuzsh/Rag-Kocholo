        "text": "Located at the intersections of new modernism, urban, and minority studies, Weimar Contact Zones examines the interplay between modernism, urban imaginaries, and the cultural production of the workers’ movement. While the Weimar Republic has long occupied a paradigmatic place in discussions of modernity and modernism in literary and cultural studies, proletarian literature and the analytical category of class have played only a marginal role. Bringing canonical Weimar literature together with the marginalized tradition of workers’ movement literature, film, and performance, the dissertation demonstrates that urban spaces functioned as contact zones where different groups interacted across lines of class and where hybridizations across boundaries of high and low culture occurred. The cultural production of the workers’ movement becomes visible as a tradition that articulated and appropriated modernist aesthetics to catalyze and represent, from the standpoint of proletarian collectives, social transformation. Understood from this perspective, modernism is not limited to high modernism or the historical avant-garde, but includes alternative cultural forms that articulate modern experiences of the lower classes. Weimar Contact Zones in this way also challenges the opposition between modernism and realism, which typically aligns workers’ movement literature with realism. The dissertation analyzes literary works by Anna Seghers, Franz Jung, Klaus Neukrantz, Kurt Kläber, Karl Grünberg, and the movie \"Kuhle Wampe, Or Who Owns the World?\", among others.\n\nThe article discusses interrelations between working-class performance culture and the German avant-gardist film \"Kuhle Wampe or Who owns the World?\" (1932). Co-produced by Slatan Dudow, Bertolt Brecht, Hanns Eisler, and Ernst Ottwalt, \"Kuhle Wampe\" contributed to the left-wing projects of producing a cinematic counter-hegemony to commercial film and creating alternative images of the proletarian masses. The film did so, the article argues, by appropriating the aesthetics of working-class performances and reimagining them through the editing techniques of modernist cinema. Contributing to the new modernist studies, the article understands the film as a form of labor movement modernism that articulated modernist aesthetics to imagine modernity from the standpoint of proletarian collectives and represented a particular emergent way of relating to and transforming modernity in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThis paper will examine the representation of movement in, and around, queer bodies exemplified in texts such as Junot Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2008) and Vu Tran’s Dragonfish (2016). These genre novels show how migrations disrupt conceptualizations of identity and citizenship across transcultural borders. A symbolic marking of queer individuals (using the expanded definition utilized by Judith Butler and others) is aligned with a literal one, becoming apparent through the movements made by the books’ characters. As José Esteban Muñoz tells us, ‘the here and now is a prison house’, and through the spectre of past and future, their bodies become constrained along axes that are simultaneously theoretical, cultural, and textual. This paper will examine the legacies of those transcultural and transhistorical migrations, linking with Jabir K. Puar’s description of ‘perverse racialized bodies’ to read the multitude of ways that perversion can be read, understood, and displaced to create what Díaz calls a kind of narrative counterspell. Ultimately, I will discuss how these texts are part of a growing corpus of cultural memory that destabilize static borders, often through narrative and genre devices that foreground liminality. Attending to their textual and cultural dynamics, this paper will discuss the implications of these books for a queer re-imagining of the transcultural that can be deconstructed through the world(s) of genre.\n\nAbstract The aim of this thesis is to contribute to a differentiated reassessment of the cultural history of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which has hitherto been hampered by critical approaches which have the objective of denouncing rather than understanding East German culture and society. Approaches such as these rely on schematic black-and-white oppositions, e.g. the dichotomy of conformity and dissidence, and present the East German cultural public spheres in a top-down way as a closed space in which a supposedly monolithic and deceitful Party ideology dictates what can be said or written. In order to reconceptualise these oversimplifying models, this thesis analyses public discourses from below, focusing on case studies of three public intellectuals with very distinct profiles: Wieland Herzfelde (1896-1988), Erich Loest (1926-2013), and Peter Hacks (1928-2003). Based on published as well as archival sources, this thesis examines their contributions to the plurality of public discourses in East Germany, concentrating on the 1950s as the most heavily contested decade of German division and the Cold War, both of which put great pressure on intellectuals. Whereas research has traditionally regarded these three intellectuals as having either a dissident or a conformist profile, this thesis argues that their attitudes were too ambiguous and the dilemmas they faced too complex to be reduced to such a clear-cut, schematic template.\n\nBy reassessing Dreiser’s novel of female development as stemming from the traditional masculinist models of Bildungsroman, this article puts pressure on the gendered dialectic between pleasure and labour in the evolving mode of production that undergirds the traditional Bildungsroman form. Dreiser produces a Bildungsroman that reconfigures the sexual logic of the genre’s relationship to Eros—the human drive to reproduce—into a sensuous depiction of monopoly capitalism’s reproduction itself, in conspicuous consumption and mass culture. Dreiser does so at a time when the Modernists turned to the figure of arrested development to reflect the seismic shift in thinking about subjective formation and its reflection of national time. It is in no way incidental that Dreiser selects a female protagonist for his task; Carrie’s apprenticeship boils down to a dialectical interplay between alienated labour and the sensuous romance of capital as a substitution for the courtship plot. Dreiser uses the homology of the unanchored female protagonist, and what her position reveals to us about the new urban American fabric, to problematise the possibility for realist literary representation to accurately bear witness to modernisation. Realism, perforce, succumbs to Romance as Carrie becomes upwardly mobile in the division of labour; but the knife of this negative dialectic cuts deep and both ways, resulting in a searing critique of America’s reproductive centres."
