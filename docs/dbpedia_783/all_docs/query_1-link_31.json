        "text": "BELGRADE. The telephones that once gave voice to anger and hope are disconnected now, behind what may still he justly called the Iron Curtain, or do not answer when you call. The thousands of people Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union who, only a few months ago, were eager to speak and write in the open have withdrawn into silence. Doors remain closed when you ring, except for the tiny spy holes which eyes flicker like the eyes of animals gone ground.\n\nFor a while, the spirit of freedom that seemed have been rekindled in this part of the world, and that caught the imagination of leaders and common people in the West, was reflected back to Eastern Europe, raising expectations loan even higher pitch. For a brief spell, a Jew in Bucharest could turn on his radio and feel a little less alone hearing the news that demonstrators in New York were picketing Soviet diplomats on behalf of another Jew, Anatoly Shcharansky, who faced trial and possible execution in Moscow.\n\nAnd today, brave manifestoes still circulate among the activists, and wives of dissidents still wait outside the police stations and prisons where their men undergo the endless interrogations that are designed less to obtain information than to break the will. But the human‐rights campaign that crested with the new year of 1977 has ebbed throughout the Soviet bloc. Most of the great hopes are gone. The K.G.B. and its regional satrapies have won another round.\n\nDoes it matter? It may make little difference to the great mass of people under Communist rule whether the human‐rights activists prevail or go under. Détente‐minded Western politicians and diplomats, Americans among them, are wont to point out that vocal dissidents were never more than a tiny minority in Eastern Europe. Any Communist government able to satisfy the demands of its population for jobs, housing, meat, television and cars (more or less in that order) can, it is argued, rule at will. Certainly, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have taken some long steps toward meeting such basic economic needs. Except in Yugoslavia, where there are some 700,000 jobless, nearly everyone in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has a job of some kind, whether he or she likes it or not. The selection of foods, especially in winter, is sometimes dreary, but most people most of the time eat far better than they did a decade ago.\n\nClothing styles, quality and availability are improving. The gulf between the fancy boutiques of Budapest and the Spartan state clothing markets of Sofia remains immense, but even in Bulgaria the improvement in dress is obvious to any visitor. Most families have television sets, many in color. Most also have washing machines and other amenities. The traffic jams along Marszalkowska Street in Warsaw, the Magheru in Bucharest and Gorky Street in Moscow have come in the past two or three years to rival those of Western capitals.\n\nThose who make the system work for them do well by any standard, and it is not even necessary to join the Communist Party, although it certainly helps. The scientist, writer, artist or musician belonging to the appropriate trade union or national academy may, with diligence, aspire to a standard of living that would be envied in New York or Paris. His apartment is likely to be in a picturesque part of town overlooking cobbled streets and medieval alchemists’ laboratories. He may own a Mercedes, a summer resort in the mountains or near the beach, a bank account in hard foreign currency, and even a passport for travel abroad. His children stand a good chance of receiving the kind of education theoretically available to everyone, but in practice accessible only to the offspring of politiAs a rule, membership in an official professional union requires little political involvement beyond the obligatory signing of occasional manifestoes denouncing, say, Israeli military sales to South Africa. Of course, a much more difficult political act is sometimes required—the condemnation of a colleague or friend who has strayed from the fold. Such a betrayal may be required in the form of a letter to the party paper, or a vole to expel the dissident from the union, thereby depriving him of the chance to earn a livelihood in his own field. Most professionals find this kind of task ‘repugnant, but they do it. To refuse would mean putting oneself at odds with the party bureaucrats who rule all professional associations. And that, in turn, would mean joining the outcasts, pariahs and nonpersons.\n\nConsidering the advantages of belonging to the professional elite and the terrible consequences of being cast out of such a society, secret‐police interrogators are seemingly mystified by what they regard as the perversity of human nature. Scores of intellectuals summoned for questioning by the K.G.B. or its equivalents report that they are nearly always asked some variant of this question: “You, gifted by birth with a fine mind, and by our socialist society with the finest education, rose to the very highest rank. You enjoyed universal respect, you had a wonderful apartment and car, you were permitted to attend international conferences abroad, you had the cream of everything. Now you have signed a protest defending a traitor to the nation (or have applied to emigrate, or have committed some infraction) and you have thus thrown everything away. How could\n\nIn a general way, the human‐rights campaign of 1977 was apparently equally mystifying to those who commanded the secret police—Leonid Brezhnev in the Soviet Union, Gustav Husak in Czechoslovakia, Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia, and the rest. The 1976 riots in Poland were the direct result of an abortive government move to raise the price of food, but developments throughout Eastern Europe in 1977 seem to have had more subtle antecedents.\n\nMuch of the impetus certainly came from without. Dissidents throughout Communist Europe say they were powerfully inspired by some of the wording of the Helsinki accord of Aug. 1, 1975. Though not binding on any of the 35 signatory nations and ambiguous in some of its provisions, the accord specifically supported “freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,” as well as “the freedom of the individual to profess and practice, alone or in community with others, religion or belief, acting in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience.”\n\nNothing had seemingly changed within the Soviet bloc, yet Moscow and its satellites had underwritten a document that read like a bill of rights for freedom of belief and expression. Furthermore, the signatory nations would meet in Belgrade in the fall of 1977 to assess compliance with the aims of the Helsinki document. This conference would probably continue well into 1978, and, Western diplomats told friends, would help to “keep the Soviets’ feet to the fire” on human‐rights compliance. (The signatories have now been meeting since Oct. 4.)\n\nAnother piece of legal underpinning came in the form of final ratification of the intergovernmental International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an agreement less well‐known in the West but enormously important to Eastern European human‐rights proponents. The covenant came into effect March 23, 1976, three months after it had been ratified by a 35th nation. Unlike the Helsinki accord, it binds the signatories by treaty. Paradoxically, the covenant was brought to legal force with the signature of one of the most repressive regimes in Europe, that of Czechoslovakia. Ironically, the opening guns of the 1977 rights campaign were fired in Czechoslovakia—with the drafting and world‐wide publication of the dissident appeal called\n\nThe charter charged the Prague Government with violating the constitution and laws of Czechoslovakia by trampling on the legal rights of citizens. Among the victims, the charter noted, were thousands of former followers of the liberalized Communist regime of Alexander Dubcek. The Dubcek people, since Dubcek was overthrown by the Soviet invasion of 1968, have, in many cases, been denied suitable employment, have been confined to inadequate housing, and have had their children barred from proper education. The document carefully stated that its signers had no wish to change the Government of Czechoslovakia or put an end to its Communist system. The signers merely demanded official compliance with the guarantees provided by Czech law.\n\nCharter 77 was a long and verbose document; soundly democratic though its ideas were, they were hardly expressed in the ringing phrases calculated to bring men running to the barricades. It was the subsequent brutal behavior of Husak's police establishment that, more than anything else, focused the attention of Europe and the world on Charter 77.\n\nThe spokesmen fur the 241 initial signers and the hundreds who later signed Charter 77 were Jiri Hajek, Dubcek's Foreign Minister until the Soviet invasion of 1968, and the philosopher Jan Patocka. Through repeated arrests and other forms of repression, Hajek's statements to the world were all but halted, and Patocka was, in effect, done to death. On March 13, 10 days after an 11‐hour interrogation to which he had been subjected by the police, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Acts of of NI dal violence against the signers of Charter 77 became commonplace, and it seemed for a while to make no difference to the authorities that observers from the West (including this correspondent) were sometimes able to give the outside world eyewitness reports on what was happening.\n\nAmong the victims were the playwright Pavel Kohout and his wife. Kohout was fairly well‐known in the West—one of his plays, “Poor Murderer,” had been running on Broadway just before his first arrest—and the police treatment to which he and his wife were subjected brought angry statements from Arthur Miller and many others in the West. Leonard Bernstein canceled a scheduled appearance in Prague, and many other cultural contacts between Czechoslovakia and the West were cut off.\n\nThe Helsinki conferees of 1975: the accord that raised hopes.\n\nThe gross tactics of the 1 Czechoslovak police galvanized every dissident and advocate of human rights in Europe, and most of them sent telegrams or letters of moral support to Hajek in Prague. Inspired by the courage of the Czechs, other East Europeans wrote and signed local adaptations of Charter 77, calling for governmental observance of domestic laws on human rights. Among these was a document drafted by the Rumanian novelist Paul GO= and seven friends; this soon acquired a political impetus of its own.\n\nMeanwhile, President Carter had jolted both Communist and Western leaders by writing a personal letter of support to the Soviet Nobel laureate and dissident, Andrei Sakharov, and by receiving Vladimir Bukovsky, a veteran of Soviet imprisonment and persecution, at the White House.\n\nThe Soviet leaders clearly saw a significant threat in all this, and reacted by taking forceful action against the most visible troublemakers. Among them were members of the so‐called Helsinki Monitoring Group, an association of Soviet citizens organized to assess Soviet implementation—or its lack—of the humanrights provisions of the Helsinki accord. The founder of the group was Yuri Orlov, 52, a world‐renowned physicist and expert in high‐energy particle accelerators. Arrested in February, he was held for months at the infamous Lefortovo prison before authorities got around to charging him with “dissemination of fabrications defaming the Soviet state.” His trial is expected soon. If convicted, he could receive a prison term up to three years.\n\nTo date, some 12 members of the Helsinki Monitoring Group have been arrested. By far the most serious case is that of Anatoiy Shcharansky, a 29year‐old computer expert reported to have been accused of treason and espionage—both capital offenses. One of the main charges against Shcharansky has to do with the fact that he knew an American newspaper correspondent.\n\nThe newspaperman was Robert C. Toth, Moscow correspondent of The Los Angeles Times, who was picked up on June 11 and subjected to daily K.G.B. questioning at Lefortovo Prison for a whole week. Ostensibly, Toth was accused of receiving state secrets from a Soviet citizen—a quasi‐scientific paper having to do with experiments in parapsychology. Much of the questioning, however, had to do with his contacts with various Soviet dissidents, contacts that are normal for most Western reporters within the Soviet bloc.\n\nToth has related that he did not deny acquaintance with many of them but went no further in his testimony. Refused access to any American consular official during his questioning, Toth finally signed the record of the interrogation presented him by the K.G.B. and was told he could leave. Having concluded his assigned tour in Moscow anyway, he left the Soviet Union immediately. Since then, the Soviet press has charged that Toth was a C.I.A. spy, adding that he would have been tried and punished on espionage charges but for the magnanimity of the Soviet authorities.\n\nSuch charges could be dismissed as the nonsense they are except that any Soviet citizen who met Toth can now be charged with being an agent of an Atnerican spy. Therein lies the sinister aspect of the Toth case. To dissidents throughout Eastern Europe, the implication was obvious. Any Western newsman could, at any time, be charged by any Communist government with being a spy, and any local citizen known to have had any contact with him could die before a firing squad. Yet, isolated and under siege as they are, and deprived of any outlet in the domestic press, the dissidents, in most cases, cannot even make a meaningful personal sacrifice unless some outsider is present to record their deeds and statements during the short period before they are silenced.\n\nThe situation is one that has created problems for the correspondents themselves: the recent experience of The New York Times's bureaus in Eastern Europe has been typical. Christopher Wren, Moscow bureau chief, was denounced in Moscow's Literaturnaya Gazeta as a C.I.A. spy. (So were George Krimsky and Alfred Friendly Jr., former Moscow correspondents of The Associated Press and Newsweek.) Wren was set upon by Soviet plainclothesmen while covering a dissident art show, and had several of his teeth broken. Paul Hofmann, Vienna correspondent of The Times, was arrested by Czech authorities on an international train, underwent hours of interrogation, had all his journalistic papers and documents seized, and was finally forced to walk for miles with his suitcase across the Austrian border. As Belgrade correspondent of The Times, have been barred for varying periods from Hungary and Rumania, and permanently from Czechoslovakia, and have undergone intimidating police interrogations in Bulgaria, Rumania\n\nContact with Western newsmen, never safe for most citizens of Eastern Europe, was always a matter of the rendezvous in an unlikely place, of telephone conversations between public phone booths, of words scribbled on a magic slate to guard against the ubiquitous police microphones. Now even these precautions are inadequate. (The exception is Hungary, where anyone can say almost anything to anyone without apparent fear, even in restaurants or other public places. However superficial it may be in some respects, there is a greater impression of freedom of thought and expression in Hungary than in any other East European country, YuE,oslavia included.)\n\nHaving throttled many of the channels between local citizens and West ern newsmen, Soviet‐bloc authorities have meted out exemplary punishment to some of the more influential dissidents and have expelled others to the West. Such punishment, when it falls short of imprisonment, normally means loss of one's telephone, apartment and car, banishment to some town distant from the capital, reduction in employment from a professional level to manual labor, and the barring of the dissident's children from the most desirable forms of education. All this is usually accompanied by a warning that any further transgressions will result in long prison sentences at hard labor.\n\nBut for many dissidents this year, a signature on a protest document has often resulted in a chance to escape to the West. In Rumania, Paul Goma was arrested and suffered all the predictable consequences of his act of political defiance. But many of the others who signed the Rumanian rights appeal were issued passports to emigrate almost immediately. Some had unsuccessfully sought such passports for years. The pattern became so evident that hundreds of persons signed rights appeals in Rumania merely in hopes of obtaining a “Goma passport.” Many Germans and Hungarians were permitted to leave Rumania, as well as a number of Rumanian Jews who had been denied exit earlier, and even a few Rumanians without ethnic claims to emigration.\n\nIn East Germany, the popular dissident folk singer Wolf Biermann was banished to the West, and some 20 of the East Germans who signed a protest against his banishment are said to have been imprisoned. But many other dissident writers, artists and intellectuals have been permitted—in fact, urged—to leave, among them the noted poet Sarah Kirsch. Czechoslovakia has rid itself of a former secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Zdenek Mlynar, the philosopher Eugene Menert, and a number of others, mostly signers of Charter 77. Some of the most vocal and effective critics who were living in Communist countries at the start of 1977 now live in Tel Aviv, Paris, Vienna and New York.\n\nThis combination of direct suppression and emigration, voluntary or enforced, has sapped the activist movement. Equally effective has been the police technique of instilling mutual fear and suspicion among the dissidents. The dark Dostoyevskian psychological underground in which the East European dissident lives is a fertile field for the the kind of anxieties and suspicions that can so easily be planted by the police.\n\nThe Rumanian writer Paul Goma at home before his arrest.\n\nTypically, the dissident's home is a small, cluttered apartment with the tapestries, paintings and objets d'art of an earlier and more gracious life. The apartment is generally in some enormous, ugly block of buildings hurriedly built to alleviate the housing crisis for working families, and nearly always inconveniently distant from the city center. Since the political pariah or would‐be emigrant tends to be better educated and more intellectual than most, he or she generally owns a large stock of books, which overflow the few available shelves and pile up against the walls. Stacks of books, covered by cheap tablecloths, often serve as living‐room coffee tables. There is usually no telephone.\n\nSomewhere outside the labyrinth of passages within the housing complex there is often a cordon of watching police agents, sitting quietly in parked delivery vans, cars and bogus ambulances, monitoring the electronic gadgets that pick up voices through distant walls. Powerful‐looking middle‐aged women carrying heavy shopping bags seem to materialize from nowhere when the dissident or a friend or family member steps outside his house. The plainclothes policewomen make little effort to conceal their purpose, walking right up to their subjects and holding their microphone‐laden shopping bags as close as possible for as long as necessary.\n\nLife is dreary in the daytime. For wives, it means standing in endless lines, trying to make every kopeck or lev or zloty count on the poverty budget on which most dissidents live. But at night things come alive. “We have been bitten in our political throats,” one dissident remarked, “so we ourselves live like vampires—creatures of the night.”\n\nNight is the time of the secret police, and there is a natural instinct for the prey of the police to huddle together in the hours of darkness. Nearly all Communist countries have laws that the police may not make their raids and arrests at the homes of political suspects between the hours of 10 P.M. and 6 A.M., but such regulations seem to be generally ignored. So, each evening, there are commonly 15 or 20 people jammed into some tiny living room, washing down slivers of cheap fruit cake with tea, and talking away their fears.\n\nA casual guest of such a group in Moscow or Prague or Bucharest or Zagreb could well imagine he was passing an evening with bright bohemians with a keen sense of black humor, who lead exciting lives. But the gaiety, such as it is, is laced with tension, and the jokes cover ugly problems. Who will look after Thomas Alva Edison, a dachshund belonging to Pavel Kohout, when he is arrested? Or Goofy, the dog belonging to Paul Goma? Who can lend rina Orlov a hand while her husband Yuri is confined to a Moscow prison?\n\nCorrespondent Robert Toth: accused of being a C.I.A. spy.\n\nMuch of the local news comes from short‐wave radio—the B.B.C., Radio Free Europe. Deutsche Welle, and so forth. Some comes in the form of sum izdal, the clandestine typewritten literary works, pamphlets and news reports that The dissident communities write, type and circulate.\n\nThe dissidents listen to the news about themselves, and brag a little to each other about the biting ripostes they have given their police tormentors. But when the police are rounding up dissidents for questioning, the sense of embattled collective courage has a way of yielding to other feelings. Anyone called in for questioning is implicitly or explicitly threatened with something else—more interrogation, loss of employment, even the possibil ity of t vial and imprisonment. Questioning is always an ordeal.\n\nMost of those called tell their friends they will refuse to answer any substantive questions, especially anything that could incriminate a fellow dissident. But with the police alternately applying threats and blandishments, such resolve sometimes breaks down. The interrogator may say, “Look, we already know that you and so‐and‐so met an American spy at an embassy reception on such‐and‐such a date. You both could be prosecuted. Why don't you tell me which other of your friends have talked to the American?”\n\nMoscow dissident Anatoly Shcharansky: aceused of treason.\n\nSoviet Marshal Kulikov and Czech leader Husak in Prague.\n\nAs the police call in scores or hundreds of people, they spread the word that nearly every dissident interrogated has given them vital information that incriminates many others. And occasionally that is true. Old friends begin to look suspiciously at each other. Innuendoes over tea and fruit cake flare into harsh recriminations. A joke that originated in the Stalin era is in vogue again.\n\nThe story has it that Ivan arrives at the concentration camp and is asked by another inmate why he was arrested. “I was too late,” Ivan says. Asked what he means, Ivan explains:\n\n“Vasily and I were talking last night lie said the beef was getting scarce again, and I said yes, and that there would be another long wait for a new apartment. He said his new suit fell apart the first time he wore it, and I said it was because the party can't do anything right. So it went, until the bar closed and we went home. But at 3 A.M. I woke up and realized Vasily could send me to a concentration camp if he denounced me for what I'd said.\n\n“I also realized I could send Vasily to a concentration camp, but I realized that he realized it, too. Therefore, to prevent me from denouncing him to protect myself from his denunciation, he would have to denounce me first.\n\n“So I got up and went to the police station to denounce him first. But I was too late.”\n\nEven those who dissent from the general view of the dissenters tend to become regarded as traitors, because of the way perspectives are thrown askew by fear. The dissident Roy Medvedev, for instance, is thoroughly unpopular with his Moscow colleagues at the moment for stating publicly that human rights in Russia would make more progress without Western pressure—and part icularly without public statements by President Carter.\n\nThe very Western journalists who tried hardest to expose the dissidents’ plight have sometimes become Objects of the dissidents’ mistrust. In Yugoslavia, the imprisoned writer and critic Mihajlo Mihajlov angrily rejected contacts with several of the journalists who had taken interest in his case, accusing them of bad faith. Another Yugoslav dissident has been telling acquaintances that Western correspondents have fallen under telepathic mind control devised by the police.\n\nIn Moscow, the eminent Dr. Sakharov has charged resident Western correspondents with failing to support the dissidents adequately. On one recent occasion, Sakharov and Valentin Turchin, another leading scientist dissident (who has since been permitted to leave the U.S.S.R.), took a western correspondent to task during an automobile ride, safe from microphones. The correspondent had taken many risks over the years to cover human‐rights developments in Russia, but had written a political analysis of Soviet‐American relations that some of the dissidents regarded as a betrayal.\n\nFor the dissidents, life is dreary in daytime. ‘We live.’ said one, ‘like vampires, creatures of the night.’\n\nMany dissidents, in fact, feel that the whole idea of détente is spurious and damaging to real freedom. Many of them feel the same way about the Vatican's efforts at rapprochement with the regimes of Communist countries with Catholic populations. In Poland, where Roman Catholicism is still powerful, lay Catholics and clergymen often express bitter resentment at these initiatives. “I think,” a Polish Catholic said, “that the Pope wants to go down in history as the bringer of peace between the Church and world Communism. He forgets that while our dogma may have become flexible, theirs has not. They still stand for the rule of Communist dialectics and the destruction of dissent, be it religious social.”\n\nCzech playwright Paul Kohout (right): a cause célèbre.\n\nYugoslav writer Mihajlo Mihajlov at his 1967 trial: still in jail.\n\nWith the waning of the 1977 human‐rights campaign, the morale of the dissidents is low. Yet they point out that activism in the cause of liberalization survived the crushing of the Berlin uprising of 1953, the defeat of the Hungarian rebellion of 1956, the blighting of the Prague Spring of 1968, the suppression of the Polish worker riots of 1970 and many lesser reverses. “Each time,” a Czech said, “we were forced back into another period of hibernation. We usually retired from the struggle and passed the torch on to our sons and daughters. The year 1977 will follow the same pattern, suppose.”\n\nMany dissidents feel the whole idea of detente is spurious and damaging to the cause of freedom.\n\nWhatever happens next, most of the dissidents believe the spark will never die—and for a reason that goes beyond their own ranks. As a Soviet scientist put it: “Never mind those of us who have been forced by circumstances to become professional dissidents. The hope of the future is not so much with us as with those ordinary people of good sense and humane instincts who must, one day, unite to change things. What we do brings that day nearer.” ■"
