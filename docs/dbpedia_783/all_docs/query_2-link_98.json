The author requested that we include quite a few poems from his collection, Pick-Up Legends (Legende vom Abholen, 2011). We are happy to have done so. Edition AZUR in Dresden and Edition Rugerup in Hörby, Sweden are to be commended for their publications of Kunst’s poetry, in particular AZUR’s exquisitely designed 2015 edition of Thomas Kunst’s selections of his poetry, Kunst. Thomas Kunst. Gedichte 1984–2014. We thank our colleague, David Chisholm, for sharing several insights into the nature of Kunst’s sonnets. With the present volume, we are pleased to introduce the work of Thomas Kunst to the English-speaking world. We thank the Peter Lang publishing firm for making this possible.\n\nTucson, September 2015\n\n| 1 →\n\n·I·\n\nINTRODUCING THOMAS KUNST\n\nThomas Kunst was born on the first day of the year 1965 in Stralsund on the Baltic Sea. He grew up in East Germany, then called the German Democratic Republic (or GDR). When Kunst moved inland to Leipzig, he was pressured to join the Communist Party. He refused. A short autobiographical writing indicates why: “My GDR was the Baltic Sea, and it was never deep.” The author’s early experiences of nature flow into the rural setting of his place of residence, Leipzig, the city of Bach, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, and Nietzsche. It is a city of music, poetry, and philosophy, a nearly ideal habitat for the writer, just short of Venice, his favorite city. Although he was never overtly critical of the East German political establishment, Kunst was unsympathetic to its practices. His own experiences of life and his interaction with the lives of everyday human beings matter to him. What lies at the heart of Kunst’s art is not the worker but the individual human being. For Kunst, the political sphere is secondary to the life of art. ← 1 | 2 →\n\nThomas Kunst has received several prizes for his literary writings,1 and his writing has been supported by several fellowships and grants.2 Kunst has been a member of the international writers association P.E.N.* since 2007. On June 27, 2015, the author held an invited reading of his work at the Sarah Kirsch* house as part of the Lillingeröder Discourse Series.\n\nAll of these honors, awards, and fellowships testify to Thomas Kunst’s emerging presence as a poet of note whose work is original, significant, and worthy of attention not only among readers of German but speakers of any number of other languages. Perhaps the most engaging quality of the art of Kunst is the directness, pointedness, and clarity of expression. The Turkish-German writer, Feridun Zaimoglu*, who met Thomas Kunst at the Villa Massimo*, values Kunst’s poetry highly and credits the poet with having brought Rome to light for him. Conversely, Zaimoglu states that Kunst’s art makes the city of Leipzig shine. In his review of one of Kunst’s best collections of poetry, What would I be at the window without whales. Poems (Was wäre ich am Fenster ohne Wale. Gedichte; hereafter Whales) in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Zaimoglu articulated why the world must become familiar with him: “… the poet of whom we speak almost perishes from his feelings, and because he does not wish to take back what he has said and behave himself, and because he does not wish to elevate his aversion to become the defining literary category of his poetry, he glows with rage and with justified hatred of all those who want to know nothing of the reality that as a lover, one ceases to be a civilian. Then he is furious and unrelenting in his own distinctive manner, he sits all day on a chair in some café or in some bar at night, he’s had enough of the pious wishes, the litanies of love, the constant chatter about powerlessness that he hears at the neighboring tables, he opens the newspaper and in the arts section he comes across the names of his colleagues who have once more received some award amounting to 10,000 or 20,000 Euros—and in that very moment he actually ought to knock over the table on which the glass stands with the red wine he has almost finished drinking, he ought to walk by the pretty waitresses who are being eyed by students, he ought to call ← 2 | 3 → out slogans like: Down with the strivers! Down with the pale jellyfishes of poetry! But he doesn’t do that, he pays for his wine in a civilized manner, he folds up the newspaper and hangs it on an arm of the coatrack, and then he leaves the café or the bar peacefully. He unlocks his bicycle, climbs onto the seat, and because he always is overcome by it on the way home, he looks high up into the sky, for the question as to what kind of sky stretches out over a city is not insignificant, up there are signs to be read that only a poet can grasp in words of magic.”3\n\nUpon awarding the writer the F. C.-Weiskopf Prize* from the Academy of Arts in Berlin, the jury remarked that Kunst’s poems and lyrical prose are distinguished for their opulent imagery, musical text composition, and magical use of words. As we have noted, his language is also crystalline. Is there another contemporary German writer who engages, sometimes cruelly, everyday reality with such precision and clarity of expression? Kunst’s pen is like a scalpel. With pen in hand, the writer uproots false pretensions with brutal honesty, enthusiasm, and conviction. At the same time, Kunst’s control of his function is evident in his command of poetic form, such as the sonnet, which is one of his greatest strengths."
