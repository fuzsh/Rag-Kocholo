        "text": "Each week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, James Parker and Adam Kirsch discuss whether reactions to books all come down to taste.\n\nBy James Parker\n\nFacing the deluge, don’t we need our discernment — everything of civilization that survives in our poor Facebook-rotted brains?\n\nMy thoughts about taste — taste, what a nasty word — are rather confused. On the one hand I’m with G. K. Chesterton, for whom good taste was “the last and vilest of human superstitions,” a moldy apparatus for resisting the mind-offending obviousness, the (if you like) vulgarity, of the Truth. “All reality is iconoclastic,” C. S. Lewis said — and what is good taste if not the polishing, the caressing with soft cloths, of icons? Good taste is anti-God. Idolatrous, backward-looking, life-denying. Smash it to pieces. Walk into the light. On the other hand, Chesterton and Lewis, those fine red-faced men, never had to deal with Us Weekly, “Fifty Shades of Grey” and “Amazing America With Sarah Palin.” They never had to deal with the Internet. Facing the deluge, don’t we need — more than ever — our education, our discernment, our sensitivity, everything of civilization that survives in our poor Facebook-rotted and Twitter-colonized brains?\n\nAs an occasional reviewer of books, I use my taste. What else have I got? When Joe Strummer sang about the special detector he kept in his garage, he was singing about taste. Taste is the probe, the sensor, the multi-field meter that you swipe across the incoming object. It is to be separated, whenever possible, from one’s own little personality, which is why I try not to review books by authors I envy or despise or find very attractive. It should not be forced through the kinks of a private predilection or aversion, which is why I have learned to steer clear of the works of Thomas Pynchon: They’re just not my thing. I don’t get them. When it comes to Pynchon, I am tasteless.\n\nAh, but good taste, genuine good taste, is bigger than all that. Good taste precedes the individual. It is an inheritance, an invisible monument, a millennium of exquisite micro-choices all embedded in the fibers of the mind! Surely it will prevail! There’s a wonderful speech in Wes Anderson’s “Grand Budapest Hotel,” delivered by Ralph Fiennes in the role of the perfumed concierge Monsieur Gustave. Gustave is immaculate — a taste vector, a strutting one-man taste explosion. Crossing 1930s Europe on a train, he and his lobby boy Zero have just been delivered from some fascist thugs by the intervention of a well-bred officer. “You see,” a triumphant Gustave tells Zero, “there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity. Indeed,” he continues instructively, “that’s what we” — meaning the hotel staff — “provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant — \" But here Monsieur Gustave stops, and slumps, and utters an expletive, and stares dully out the train window. Inside his head, civilization has just collapsed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
