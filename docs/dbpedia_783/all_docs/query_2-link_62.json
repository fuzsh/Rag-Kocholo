How do you find unceasing inspiration and make your poems travel both in times of global uncertainty and when you yourself are less able to travel?”\n\nextract from Myra Schneider’s reply: “I think creativity, for most people anyway, demands a sense of excitement, the need to feel excited by an idea, a possibility for a poem. This doesn’t mean ignoring and escaping from reality. In spite of the many the problems we all live with nowadays there is much that is positive and beautiful in the world. The need for action on world problems such as poverty and climate change is at last being recognised … ”\n\nMyra Schneider’s collection, Believing in the Planet, which includes her poem following the interview, Grass, is now out, published by Poetry Space.\n\nRead the interview\n\nPand and Gain: Katherine Gallagher, Sarah James/Leavesley, Maggie Sawkins and Ruth Sharman respond to our focal point in this issue\n\nread the article\n\nSecond Light Poetry Competition 2023: read the winning poems by Jenny Hamlett and Kathy Miles, Justina Hart and Pat Marum\n\nPoems as published in the Issue.

Notes from the Forgotten War, the pamphlet’s first poem, is dedicated to ‘my father’ and written in the voice of the son for his father. It is a poem which is hard to bear for its war injury detail, but the poet’s attention to syntax, the half rhyme, the repetition, keep the reader facing forward …\n\nRead the review\n\nThe Self in Poetry … the internal/external roots of poetic imagination explored by Maria Jastrzębska, Jane Routh, Jacqueline Saphra and Margaret Wilmot\n\nread the article\n\n“Why look at a thing again and again?

Can you say a little about why you chose this title, its etymology and how the concept of ‘wild’ relates to the poems?”\n\nIn her response, Borg says “ … Wilderness … is formed now of places set aside such as national parks, places which still nevertheless can teach us about “the etiquette of freedom” – the ethics of living in a way that isn’t primarily led by the ego – and this is contrasted with the wild, which is not a place, but the inner quality, a source of authenticity, which springs up everywhere, between the cracks in the pavement and also in us. This is what I wanted to locate – what is wild in us, what that might mean … ”\n\nRead the interview\n\nSecond Light Poetry Competition, 2022, Adjudication comment by Moniza Alvi and Winning poems by Kathryn Bevis and Jane Routh\n\nread the poems\n\nBreaking New Ground: we invited Sarah Corbett, Rebecca Goss, Angela Leighton, Lorraine Mariner and Kay Syrad to give their views on ambition / widening the scope / moving forward in their work and asked for their take on the topic, whether on their own practice or across the board.\n\nFrom that “first untouched, paddy page, the thrill and the terror … ” of a new jotter (Angela Leighton), through wilderness, interrogation and a brief consideration of writer’s block, to “The Hokusai Wave … ” (Sarah Corbett), our contributing poets consider our theme of breaking new ground.\n\nRead the article\n\nSunflower, by Andria J Cooke\n\nback to menu\n\nARTEMISpoetry Issue 28, May 2022, Focus on Some Women Poets in the Border Country (North East)\n\ne-mail Administrator to buy this issue\n\nIssue 28 … Read extracts.\n\nContents:\n\nFEATURED POETS: KATHERINE GALLAGHER and RUTH SHARMAN\n\n‘BETWEEN APOLLO AND DIONYSUS’ and ‘A SENSE OF PRECARIOUSNESS’ … ANNIE WRIGHT interviews S.J.

She found a striking way to organise her material in her 1992 collection The Wild Iris, where a perspective on matters of life and death is expressed in the voice of plants not people. Her 13th collection, Winter Recipes from the Collective, is also concerned with deep issues (ageing and death among them) and makes innovative use of narrative form.\n\nRead the review\n\nSonnets of Conflicted Feelings: Myra Schneider reviews Hannah Lowe\n\nWhat immediately struck me about Hannah Lowe’s new collection, The Kids, is the total openness of her writing and the skilful way she employs the sonnet, both the traditional sonnet and variations of it, to investigate contemporary urban life, teaching, her own life and changes in it. She uses the form with wit, insight and feeling, all in a conversational tone. This is a considerable achievement.\n\nRead the review\n\nPoetry selected by Kathy Miles.

Two poets who have especially contributed to the development of a distinguished women’s poetry tradition are Judith Wright, (1915-2000) … and Gwen Harwood (1920-1995) … Very different in their backgrounds and tastes, both have stood out by their productivity, range and gifts, and their commitment to Australian poetry.\n\nRead the article\n\nFeatured Poet, Wendy French (back cover)\n\nread the poems\n\nShort reviews by Suan Jane Sims\n\n“This week I attended a memorial, then four days later a baby shower, the two inextricably linked, one celebrating and remembering a grandpa who will never see his grandchild, the other event looking forward to the birth of that child to a mother-to-be grieving for her father, yet excited at the prospect of producing new life.

Are we ‘above’, ‘alone’, a gigantic ‘I’? Alison Brackenbury reflects that “Time brings the gain of the long view.”; Kathy Miles, in relation to Social Media, posits that “these platforms are also places where the perspective of the writer is greatly exposed”, and Linda Saunders that “ – to ‘put things in perspective’ is not an illusionist technique,” note: Linda Saunders’ article continues on 3rd page (p20).\n\nRead the article\n\nFeatured Poet, Caroline Carver (inside pages)\n\nnote: poem the moving of feet has since been published in her collection Cannonball with Feathers (Oversteps Books). read the poems\n\nLives of the Poets: remembering Anne Stevesnon, Bernie Kenny, Jamie Dedes and Joanna Boulter\n\nLives of the Poets: “Poetry Loses A Leading Spirit – Anne Stevenson (1933-2020) … It was a privilege to know this vital, highly-strung, sharp but basically benign personality. Perhaps because her writing style is essentially so clear and direct, the depth and scope of her work may be as yet under-appreciated.” (Dilys Wood). “Shed Poets Remember Bernie Kenny … Bernie went forth and everything delighted her: rasp of wren, life awakening sun, a flowering thistle, always the sea. Each house move became a nesting home, every novice poet a pupil and we were all welcomed.” (Marguerite Colgan). “A Thank You to Jamie Dedes – This amazing woman had to give up her job as a features editor because of severe health problems but although she was on a kidney machine and only had one functional lung and was bedridden she never gave up, never complained but simply went on producing the webzine … Her refusal to give up is a lesson to us all.” (Myra Schneider). Joanna Boulter died in 2019 and an i.m. article by Annie Wright appeared in Issue 24. In issue 26, Annie publicised her plan to publish Joanna’s final collection posthumously on a subscription basis and the book was subsequently published.

It grew out of my Ph.D. on the Gothic. Then, after leaving full-time academia, my life started going in strange directions, and when I began training in counselling and psychotherapy, I began using writing as a form of therapy for myself. I wrote a book of short stories The Eye of the Buddha, and when they were published very easily, by the Women’s Press, I took this as a sign and encouragement that I could be a writer…\n\nRead the article\n\nThe Poetry of Helen Dunmore: Katherine Gallagher reflects\n\nI remember wondering some time back why Dunmore had so turned to fiction, albeit incredibly successfully.

The body speaks. Emily Dickinson’s poems speak. They are sounds, sound-shapes, notes, chords, a singing. They are the life-force of Emily Dickinson, singing, with, it has been said, an ‘unorthodoxy of melodic pattern controlled by key words’. And we can re-breathe the poet’s breath-spirit not only in her mainly hymnal or ballad forms, but specifically within the long or short vowels, in the touch of the consonants, in the rhythmic relationship of vowel to consonant…\n\nRead the article\n\nPoems by Kathryn Southworth – Loving the Scars, Christine Vial – Inked and Dorothy Yamamoto – Cranes in the Snow Country\n\nread the poems\n\nCome Dancing Birds, by Caro Reeves\n\nback to menu\n\nARTEMISpoetry Issue 19, November 2017\n\nEnquire for back copy\n\nIssue 19 … Read extracts.\n\nContents:\n\nEMERGENCY POET: DEBORAH ALMA interviewed by MYRA SCHNEIDER\n\nMAKING POETRY MORE ACCESSIBLE: PATRICIA McCARTHY\n\nPROTEST AND POETRY: FINDING SPACE: DILYS WOOD on BRENDA WILLIAMS\n\nREFLECTION ON REFLECTIONS: DILYS WOOD on ANNE STEVENSON’s poetry lectures\n\n‘STEVIE SMITH INVITES CONTRADICTIONS’: by KATHERINE GALLAGHER\n\nTHE SMALL FURRY ANIMAL EXPLODES: A C CLARKE on cultural context in translation\n\nWITNESS POETS AND WAR: by JOAN MICHELSON\n\nREVIEWS:\n\nR V BAILEY, ALISON BRACKENBURY, A C CLARKE, KATHERINE GALLAGHER, JUSTINA HART, KAYE Lee, MYRA SCHNEIDER, DILYS WOOD and DOROTHY YAMAMOTO on books by Shanta Acharya, Ruth Bidgood, Helen Dunmore, Magi Gibson, Jane Griffiths, Selima Hill, Joanne Limburg, Joan McGavin, Jennifer A McGowan, Joan Michelson, Grace Nichols, Fiona Sampson, Ruth Sharman, Belinda Singleton, Penelope Shuttle, Pauline Stainer,\n\nand short reviews by Dilys Wood: Denise Bennett, Emily Blewitt, Pat Borthwick, Anne Caldwell, A C Clarke, Katherine Gallagher, Cora Greenhill, June Hall, Jenny Hamlett, Joy Howard, Alice Kavounas, Alwyn Marriage, Rosemary Norman, Anne Stewart and Susan Utting\n\nPOETRY:\n\nFEATURED POETS: KATE FOLEY and KAY SYRAD\n\nPOETRY COMPETITION, JUDGE MYRA SCHNEIDER, winning poems by: Jill Eulalie Dawson, Mary Robinson, Liz Diamond, Shirley Wright\n\nand commended poems by: Jill Boucher, Hilaire, Daphne Gloag, Nicolette Golding, Mary Robinson and Martha Street\n\nPOETRY SELECTED BY ANNE STEWART: Carol Beadle, Chris Considine, Lucy Cotterill, Kay Cotton, Wendy Everitt, Viv Fogel, Wendy French, Cynthia Fuller, Jenny Hamlett, Janet Hatherley, Penny Hope, Paula Jennings, Kaye Lee, Caroline Maldonado, Moya Pacey, Jo Peters, Jenna Plewes, Penelope Shuttle, Judith Taylor, Rosy Wilson, Glynda Winterson and Lynne Wycherley\n\nARTWORK: by Andria J Cooke, Viv Fogel, Kathryn Healey, Jenny Herbert and Alison Mace\n\nExtracts, Issue 19 ** All items subject to copyright ©, e-mail for permissions enquiries\n\n“Reflections on Reflections…”\n\nReflections on Reflections – Dilys Wood on Anne Stevenson’s lectures at Ledbury Festival in 2016\n\n“Forgetting identity is clearly as important to Stevenson, as for some poets and critics is ‘finding identity’ – this is one of the thoughts in these lectures that stops us in our tracks, makes us think again.”\n\nRead the article\n\nStevie Smith ‘Collected Poems and Drawings’\n\n“Stevie Smith Invites Contradictions” – Katherine Gallagher, quoting Will May\n\nIn September 2002, when Joanna Cameron and I were co-organising the ten-day Poetry Festival for the Centenary of the Palmers Green poet Stevie Smith, we were amazed to find that the Collected Poems of this ‘national treasure’ were out of print.

Would you say that there is a tension for you between the rival belief systems of science and religion that provides a driving force in your creative work?\n\nJB: I’m not sure I would say there’s a tension between science and religion. I was exposed a lot from an early age to the Bible and hymns, but I think the important thing may be that ‘love of the world’s mysteries’ that you point out.

She has deep reservoirs of skill and knowledge and is an innovator. The decision to work within a line limit seems to inspire new, exciting ways of constructing the approach to each poem.\n\nIt’s a tough assignment to say what’s included in any Khalvati poem in this phase of her work. Her approach is sophisticated, subtle, sometimes indirect. Moods overlap. Formality and informality are made to work in harness.

The use of rhyme to make connections, the employment of upper or lower case and drawing attention to the way in which the word’s physical construction is heightened by its sound (Abut) – and vice versa – plus the courage to allow a single line/image to occupy a whole page (as in now), are all part of the varied process by which Allnutt holds her audience in thrall.\n\nfrom Schneider on Alvi: Athar’s mother is a heroic figure who endures hardship and grief and rises above them. The narrative follows the stages of her exile, the community’s exile: the shock of remote government forcing the families to uproot themselves, the journey, the total disorientation of living in a temporary camp, the heart-rending distress when Athar can’t be found, the gradual settling into a new home and the acceptance of life a different place in spite of the continuing sense of loss. I believe At a Time of Partition will be read by people who wouldn’t normally read poetry because it reads as a compelling story and yet it is very much a poem. How has Alvi made it work?\n\nfrom Wood on Adcock: Glass Wings strongly evidences – in my view more so than Dragon Talk – Adcock’s ‘emotional intelligence’, her ability to tell us more than we know about our own weaknesses. In Having Sex with the Dead, one of the book’s more striking poems, having the somewhat ‘louche’ tone which sometimes crops up in Adcock’s work, the poet succeeds in conveying both the strong physical excitement and the routine irresponsibility of what might have once been called ‘free love’: “They have all forgotten now: forgotten / you and their wives and other mermaids / who slithered in their beds and took their breath”. The reason for forgetting is that the “one time flesh and pulsing blood” has “long been ash and dispersed chemicals”.\n\nRead reviews\n\nPoem by Elizabeth Hare: If Only\n\nread the poem\n\nPoem by Glynda Winterson: Taking It Home\n\nread the poem\n\nback to menu\n\nPAST ISSUES…\n\nARTEMISpoetry Issue 11, NOVEMBER 2013 SOLD OUT – enquire for pdf copy\n\nIssue 11 … Read extracts\n\nContents:\n\nAMONG THE ALREADY OCCLUDED WORLDS: GILLIAN ALLNUTT interviewed by RUTH O’CALLAGHAN\n\nWHO IS POETRY FOR?

And to what end does this NICK become the silent character who, we are told, is always onstage and who “measures things”? The impression grows that this translation intends to offer us words with their remoteness and strangeness still upon them.\n\nIn such a manner Carson advances, with compressions and elisions of the original text, with references to modern thought, with diction which slides into contemporary usage and out of it again, with page layouts capable of slowing movement to a single phrase and with the counter-balance of mysterious illustrations. There is a sense that considerable forces have been marshalled for an assault on an intractable object…\n\nRead review\n\nReview: Myra Schneider on Stag’s Leap by Sharon Olds.\n\nThe moving confession must echo what many have experienced. Indeed the explicit expression of distressing personal feelings, often drawing on everyday matter and body detail for imagery, is the great strength of Olds’ work. It is this which communicates to many people. She then admits: “In me now / there’s a being of sheer hate, like an angel / of hate.” This is almost the only time that Olds allows anger about the break up of the marriage to surface…\n\nRead review\n\nReview: Dilys Wood on Tiger Facing the Mist by Pauline Stainer.\n\nStainer has always been in tight control of language, has always written in a vivid, densely metaphorical, minimalist way. There is no great change – certainly no lapse – except that there is a touch here and there of a new wittiness, a combination of the daring with the laid back. In [the same poem] (Reading by snowlight) where she says “I want to take the weight / out of language”, I felt a slight jolt at the witty use of ‘moccasin’ as a verb: “ … outside, / everything is moccasined…”\n\nRead review\n\nSecond Light Poetry Competition, Second Prize Winner Gill Learner: Chill Factor\n\nread the poem\n\nLapith Woman, copyright © Monica Farthing:\n\nback to menu\n\nARTEMISpoetry Issue 10, MAY 2013 enquire for back copy\n\nIssue 10 … Read extracts\n\nContents:\n\nLISTENING TO THE SILENCES: MIMI KHALVATI interviewed by RUTH O’CALLAGHAN\n\nMY LIFE IN POETRY: RUTH FAINLIGHT\n\nTHE POSSIBILITIES AND PITFALLS OF NARRATIVE: MYRA SCHNEIDER\n\nBREAKING THE GLASS CEILING: the series continues with ADELE WARD on starting a publishing house\n\nMY TRUMPET TEACHER IS A POET – IS THAT COOL?

I thought I started publishing at seventeen. I think it was a bit like the young John Clare hiding his poems in the chimney-breast. Perhaps it began as a way of communicating with my mother when we were separated by showing or reciting them to her when I was taken to see her.

What a treat then to read four women poets in this series. For all of them, despite their different voices, a central theme is women’s fractured, conflicted sense of self along with a questioning of our relationship to language.

In poetry, my impression was that I could use simple language and be much less pretentious. I am not very aware of aesthetic influences during those early years.

Three important senior poets with very different ‘voices’ tell us something about poetry. It’s an art-form almost too close to us, relating to speech which is ‘natural’ and the hall-mark of humans. However, as each of these three poets builds towards a career-length achievement, we appreciate her unique ‘construct’, overcoming the resistance of form and language to her own needs and aims. These poets struggle, tread water, succeed and fail. But, even in a blind reading, we might recognise each mature voice here: its timbre; its own natural / unnatural, highly original expression.\n\nRead reviews\n\nPoem by Helen Jagger: Leaving Home\n\nread the poem\n\nPoem by Astrid Alben: once more\n\nread the poem\n\nHands 2, copyright © Andria J Cooke:\n\nback to menu\n\nARTEMISpoetry Issue 6, May 2011 Read extracts enquire for back copy\n\nARTEMISpoetry – Issue 6 Erratum\n\nWe apologise for the mis-spelling of Allison McVety’ name in the contents list and in the review of her collection, Miming Happiness on page 37.\n\nEditors, ARTEMISpoetry\n\nIssue 6 Contents:\n\nINTERVIEW: Pia Tafdrup interviewed by Ruth O’Callaghan\n\nBREAKING THE GLASS CEILING: Jan Fortune-Wood & Alwyn Marriage\n\nTAKE-OFF INTO A RICHER WRITING UNIVERSE: Alison Brackenbury, June English, Lynda How, Myra Schneider & Anne Stewart on getting into the www"
