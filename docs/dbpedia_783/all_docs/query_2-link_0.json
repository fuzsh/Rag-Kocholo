        "text": "I first came across the poetry of the German poet Sarah Kirsch when studying East German literature. But I returned to her work more recently in an attempt to understand more about how free verse functioned by entering Kirsch’s poems through the close reading and mimicry required when translating.\n\nMy main interest in Kirsch’s poems the second time around, then, was their mechanics. How were her free-verse poems structured? And were there any other salient features that I would have to consider? I was examining them, in short, as a translator would appraise any translation assignment, to discover any elements that would require special attention during the translation process.\n\nOne of the main organising principles of Kirsch’s work, which I discovered in the course of such analysis as well as by trial and error in the initial stage, is underscored in this short poem by the words highlighted in bold. (Ignore the words in red for the moment):\n\nJedes Blatt [Kirsch]\n\nIch sage dir was ich sehe manchmal\n\nJedes Blatt einzeln am Baum oder\n\nAufm Kies kleine Sicheln oder wie das\n\nWeitergeht mit mir: kurze Aufenthalte\n\nAlles wieder zusammenpacken und fort\n\nSince German is a phonetic language, it should be clear even if you don’t read German that the poet is deploying end-line assonance, so I decided to try to replicate this feature in English, as highlighted in bold below:\n\nEach leaf [Stokes]\n\nI tell you what I sometimes see\n\nEach leaf singly on the tree or\n\nLittle sickles in among the stones or\n\nHow things will go for me: short stop-overs\n\nPacking everything up again and off\n\nAs you might have surmised from my rendering, assonance also features throughout Kirsch’s verse, as does alliteration, and both features enrich the sound of the poems. I noted this and attempted to replicate this quality in my English translations, too, as highlighted in red above.\n\nGiven the differences in sound patterning of German and English, the English sounds necessarily differ from the German ones: The German ‘ae’ sound represented by the spelling ‘ei’ is replaced in my rendering by ‘i’ because I wanted to retain as much of the content of Kirsch’s poems as possible and maintaining the German sound pattern in English would have involved too much loss of the original’s denotative and connotative meaning. I also decided that Kirsch’s phonic patterns weren’t symbolic, i.e. it wasn’t the specific sounds in the original’s alliteration and assonance that mattered but the sound patterning per se. Kirsch, in short, uses sound musically rather than suggestively, so I was able to replace German sounds with sounds in English that are different but have a comparable effect.\n\nAnother notable feature of the above poem is the diction. I noticed that Kirsch frequently uses colloquial language and that earlier translators had often overlooked this. In the poem below, for instance, ‘sollen’ was previously translated as ‘reputed’ while ‘Huhnähnliche Wesen die zu / Singen vermochten…’ was rendered as ‘Gallinaceous creatures capable of / Song…’. The register, to my mind, isn’t right, so in my own translations I set out to replicate the simplicity of Kirsch’s language, which also supports the message of this poem.\n\nBäume [Kirsch]\n\nFrüher sollen sie\n\nWälder gebildet haben und Vögel\n\nAuch Libellen genannt kleine\n\nHuhnähnliche Wesen die zu\n\nSingen vermochten schauten herab.\n\nTrees [Stokes]\n\nIt is said that in times gone by\n\nThey formed forests and that birds\n\nAlso called dragonflies\n\nSmall creatures like singing hens\n\nLooked down from them.\n\nThe above poems were written after the poet moved to the West in 1977. But I’ll leave you with a longer and earlier poem by Kirsch in which all of the features mentioned above are already in evidence. Note also Kirsch’s use of run-on lines. What the German writer and critic Peter Hacks termed the ‘Sarah sound’, when the writer first started publishing in East Germany in the late-sixties, is characterised by a sense of flow attained through minimal use of punctuation and by a sliding syntax in which the final part of one clause often serves as the start of the next one as well. Also, as is evident from all three examples, though Kirsch’s use of punctuation varies, commas, when used at all, generally separate out ideas or different geographical or temporal spaces, rather than serving the usual grammatical function in German of dividing clauses. And many of her poems end with a full stop, even if no other punctuation is present.\n\nThe sense of casualness and the ambiguities that result from Kirsch’s diction and syntax were undoubtedly expedient features of critical verse produced and published within the ideological confines of the GDR. But after the poet moved to the West, these elements remained essential features of her style. I consequently retained Kirsch’s punctuation in my translations since it worked equally well in English.\n\nEngel [Kirsh]\n\nIch sah einen er kam im Taxi der Vordersitz\n\nWar flachgelegt so hatte er Platz\n\nMan hob ihn heraus vor dem kleinen Fischgeschäft\n\nGeleitete ihn in einen geschorenen Garten\n\nDa stand er ernst in der Luft überragte\n\nDie ihn stützten seine Augen erreichte nichts\n\nDie Kleider waren verblaßt Goldreste\n\nÜberzogen die Brust er war ohne Flügel\n\nSeine Führer lehnten ihn an einen Karren\n\nBlockierten zuvor die Räder damit er\n\nNicht ins Gleiten käme sich etwa zerschlüge\n\nIch sah seine Hände sie waren leer\n\nHatten wohl vorher den Ӧlzweig getragen oder\n\nEin Saitenspiel jahrhundertelang\n\nJetzt war er taxiert unterwegs auf Wohnungssuche\n\nErst ins Antiquitätengeschäft was wird aus ihm wer\n\nBraucht schon einen Engel der so groß ist\n\nEr füllt eine Küche stände\n\nWo besser ein Kühlschrank steht oder der Tisch mit\n\nDer Brotschneidemaschine, der Ausweg für ihn\n\nWäre ein Kindergarten wenn der ihn beherbergte\n\nWer wüchse nicht gern mit einem Engel auf\n\nAngels [Stokes]\n\nI saw one he came in a taxi the front seat\n\nWas laid flat to make space for him\n\nThey lifted him out in front of the little fish shop\n\nEscorted him into a close-cropped garden\n\nHe hovered there solemnly in the air over-towering\n\nThose supporting him his gaze fixed on nothing\n\nHis clothes were faded gold vestiges\n\nCoated his chest he was wingless\n\nHis guides leaned him up against a cart\n\nWhose wheels they had jammed so that\n\nIt wouldn’t roll off and crash perhaps\n\nI saw his hands they were empty\n\nHad of course held the olive branch earlier\n\nOr for hundreds of years a stringed instrument\n\nNow he was being taxied about hunting for a flat\n\nFirst stop the antique shop what will become of him\n\nWho on earth needs an angel who’s so large\n\nHe fills a kitchen and would occupy space\n\nBetter used for a fridge or the table with\n\nThe bread slicer on it, the alternative\n\nWould be for a playschool to take him in\n\nWho wouldn’t like to grow up with an angel\n\nI translated over 100 poems by Kirsch in the end and learned a lot about free verse along the way. My selection of poems from the ten volumes Kirsch published between 1967 and 2001 is collected in following volume, which also contains a critical introduction to this free-spirited individual’s life and work: Sarah Kirsch, Ice Roses (Carcanet, 2014)."
