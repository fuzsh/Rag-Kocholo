        "text": "Very saddened to learn of Kemmer Anderson’s passing on March 3, 2023. He taught at my high school for 42 years and was my sophomore year English teacher. He was the first “real” poet I had ever met in person and it was through his urging that I read poetry deeply and use that as a path to write poetry.\n\nIt was under his guidance that I eventually published my first ever work in a nationally circulated small press. He was an advocate of poetry as an art form and as a means of connecting society to itself and people to each other. He hosted school coffee houses that merged poetry with letter writing gatherings for Amnesty International. Long after I graduated he’d continue to send me poems and encourage my work, mentoring me as well as so many other classmates that would go on to find writing as important parts of their lives.\n\nHe was patient, a poet philosopher that was always talking about Plato’s cave and our place among its shadows and its flickering lights.\n\n// The Rumpus Poetry Book Club: Zeina Hashem Beck and “O”\n\nWas so lucky to hear Zeina Hashem Beck read what ended up being my favorite poem in her new collection “O”.\n\nJust a couple of weeks before we gathered virtually for the Rumpus Poetry Book Club, I was in the OR for a family member myself. Coincidentally that was when I first encountered “Flamingos”.\n\nThere was even an impromptu original language vs. Google Translate throwdown when discussing one of the poems read aloud in Arabic.\n\nThat led to a fascinating discussion of what emotional temperature the same words can take when read aloud in one language vs. another. And in a true moment of serendipitous performance art, the internet connection became temporarily garbled during a reading of the poem, “Ode to Babel”.\n\nThanks so much to The Rumpus for hosting such a nice session.\n\n// Lives of Luxury and the Hong Kong International Review\n\nGot word today from Kenyon Review legend Nancy Zafris that she was going to take one of my poems for The Hong Kong Review, the inaugural issue of which she will be the Editor.\n\nThe poem was inspired this past summer at the Kenyon Review Writers Workshop during a viewing of the short film, Paul’s Case, based on the short story of the same name by Willa Cather. Cather’s story is about longing for a world that’s aspired to, yet intangibly out of reach, where a high society life can be a temporary placeholder for belonging, but if lacking authenticity (or the societal acceptance of you being authentic), then one’s own life may not even be enough to redeem for acceptance.\n\nHonored by the chance to be a part of a new publication and grateful to Nancy, Kenyon Review and the Hong Kong Review for being allowed inside its first pages.\n\n// A Touch of Incredulity and Alarm\n\n“In more fortunate countries, where human dignity isn’t assaulted so readily, poets yearn, of course, to be published, read, and understood, but they do little, if anything, to set themselves above the common herd and the daily grind . . . The moment always came when poets had to close the doors behind them, strip off their mantles, fripperies, and other poetic paraphernalia, and confront — silently, patiently, awaiting their own selves — the still-white sheet of paper. For finally this is what really counts.”\n\nWIsława Szymborska (1923-2012)\n\nFrom Szymborska’s acceptance speech for the 1996 Nobel Prize for Literature, she calls out what I myself, and other poets I’m sure, have been sensing since we first started putting verse to paper.\n\nI think there’s always a bit of self inflicted imposter syndrome when it comes to poets and writing poetry. There is no public certification, no licensing exam to pass to “become” a poet. Words inked on paper or typed across a computer screen, or simply just speaking into a mic, are really the only qualifiers and even then, at best, are only subjectively good or bad.\n\nSzymborska says, “Contemporary poets are skeptical and suspicious even, or perhaps especially, about themselves. They publicly confess to being poets only reluctantly, as if they were a little ashamed of it.” Because as poets we’re less terrified if someone doesn’t take us seriously when we say, “I’m a poet” than we are when someone does take us seriously. Okay. Now what do I do?\n\nThe sometimes tying of art forms to some kind of money-making profession may be a valid demand for practical reasons (rent, food, Amazon Prime). So in passing conversation, as she continues, “..poets prefer to use the general term ‘writer’ or replace ‘poet’ with the name of whatever job they do in addition to writing.”\n\nSo is poetry what you do? (“This weekend, I went to crossfit, got an oil change, then drafted a poem.”)\n\nOr who you are? (“I’m a manager of financial portfolios equivalent in size to the GDPs of small countries. As a poet, this inspires verse to appear in the margins of my legal pad.”)\n\nSaying “I’m a writer,” can mean a host of things that connect the act of writing down words to the act of paying bills.\n\nSaying, “I’m a poet,” points us to Szymborska’s other observation that, “Bureaucrats and bus passengers respond with a touch of incredulity and alarm when they discover the they’re dealing with a poet.”\n\nBut the National Endowment for the Arts in 2018 does reassure us that poetry is making a comeback. I’m hopeful that along with this resurgence will be an embrace of poetry not just as an art form, but as an act of declaration, documentary, response.\n\nI had a huge privilege to be admitted as part of a community of eighty poets, fiction and creative non-fiction writers for the 2017 Kenyon Review Writers Workshop. I studied there with Carl Phillips and together with a high caliber class, we spent ten intense days isolated on a grassy hill an hour north of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nPast Workshop attendee Molia Dumbleton's blog was all I needed to be convinced to apply for this summer's session and item by item, all eight of her observations became obvious as I worked through my time in Gambier.\n\nThe strong writers surrounding me formed a truly stunning group, their passion for writing and engaging as a community outshining their already impressive accolades, publications and academic fellowships.\n\nThe generative aspect of the Workshop was what made the place so special. Alongside writers that also care deeply about the craft of writing, you are all creating new work from scratch together, experiencing the styles and approaches that have made each of you successful in your own ways. Then your work is critiqued in workshop by a jury of your peers. Your conversations over a coffee or pint of beer aren't just, \"What are you reading?\" but \"What is it about what you're reading that you think makes it such an impactful piece of writing?\"\n\nMy take on the Kenyon Writers Workshop's impact on creative writers is this:\n\n// Can't Stop Won't Stop - To echo Molia's blog above: the week is nonstop, overwhelmingly generative. You extract new work through guidance, prompts and critiques throughout the entire week. It's simultaneously exhausting and rewarding by day ten.\n\n// Nowhere to Hide - Due to a combination of Kenyon College being quite removed from anything other than you, your pen, and your laptop, you will be writing on a hill in the Ohio countryside designed to keep you writing. All excuses, procrastination and distractions are removed (not sure to curse or praise John Legere and TMobile for my not having even a pixel of signal in Gambier). If you need some physical relief, there's the shining Kenyon Athletic Center, full scale indoor and outdoor tracks, tennis courts and gym, otherwise, an idle pen becomes a restless one.\n\n// Kenyon Moments - Whether you're standing in line for a cafe au lait and Better Morning Muffin at Wiggin Street Coffee, stopping along the Middle Path to chat with a fellow writer who's in between thoughts while sprawled in an Adirondack chair, or meeting up for drinks and quesadillas at the VI , you will create a hundred mini, interstitial conferences between yourself and your fellow writers from across all genres, sharing ideas and urging each other onwards. And each night when you gather in front of the entire workshop for readings, it's all at once inspirational, revelatory, celebratory.\n\nPortugal scored the winning goal in the 2016 Euro Cup and the room filled with fist pumps and clapping.\n\nThe surreal part of that whole moment was that it took place in a Iowa City shopping mall over food court Chinese takeout. The big screen television in the center of the seating area was surrounded by clamshell fast food boxes and orange plastic trays.\n\nI tried not to get hot sauce on my notebook.\n\nI had just finished my first Iowa Summer Writing Festival, studying poetry over a weekend in July and drifting through the hallowed campus trails where the Iowa Writer's Workshop took shape nearly 80 years ago and was reflecting on the last couple of days.\n\nI knew I was in the only UNESCO City of Literature in the US when even the local hotel and convention center had an elegant library dedicated to Iowa Writers, including an entire shelf of Pulitzer winners with ties to the Workshop. I also learned that Jorie Graham is everywhere, inside Prairie Lights Books, quoted on posters and sidewalks, making appearances on sculptures hidden in wildlife preserves. That would explain some of the high energy intensity I felt when I heard her read at the 92nd Street Y in New York a few years ago, radiating through time, space and library shelving.\n\nSo in Iowa City, I studied with Katie Ford and seven inspiring classmates by day. And by night, to stay grounded, I had singles of Iowa-local Cedar Ridge bourbon alongside poet Kim Addonizio's new memoir about the pobiz.\n\n\"When we talk about the writing life, \" Addonizio says, \"we don't just mean getting words onto the page; we also mean those times we desperately want to write, but can't.\"\n\nAll surreal enough to startle me back into writing with full momentum.\n\nBroaden the circle of poets and poetic styles that attract you. I like that.\n\nI remember an interview with artist Neil Jenney where his advice to artists wasn't to exhaustively read Van Gogh's letters to Theo or anything, but to just look at art.\n\nTo make good art you have to look at other art, even art that you don't necessarily like, as long as you can lucidly characterize why you don't (or do!) like it. That understanding of your personal tastes of good art vs. bad art leads towards your own growth.\n\nPoetry is the same way -- the wider your \"discourse radius\" the more exposure you will have to the broader world of writing that's out there.\n\nBut Wojahn also extends his reading and collection of information beyond poetry to the wider scope of information itself. Somewhere in there is a source of more poetry.\n\n\"...I use the notebooks mostly as a kind of commonplace book...I tend to read more history, nonfiction, science, biography and various oddball stuff than I read poetry, and the purpose of doing this is sometimes merely to preserve special and eccentric facts that intrigue me.\"\n\nAnd to share advice that he himself received. Better is better.\n\n\" 'Don’t worry so much about your poems—eventually they’ll get better.' This wasn’t exactly profound advice, but somehow it buoyed me. It reminded me that if you put the proper degree of time and effort into your craft, and keep doing it consistently, the odds are that you will get better. \"\n\nSo it's broadening your discourse radius, being open to new information and remaining diligent in its pursuit and ultimately, take the long view:\n\n\"As Auden says, more poets fail from lack of character than from lack of talent. I like to remind my students that if they do the work they need to do, the odds are that in ten years’ time your poetry will improve; in twenty years, it will improve even more...It’s not all over by the time you reach thirty in the way that it is for Olympic athletes.\"\n\nSo stick with it, keep revising the work. The most disruptive way to shake-up your craft is to let it grow, steadily, letting it shape itself. But it can't do that alone.\n\nYou need to be there doing the hard work in guiding it, letting it mature, removing the precipitate, reblending it again.\n\nAnd then you just might be able to raise your glass.\n\nTo check out the entire September 2015 interview, visit Kenyon Review here."
