        "text": "Way back in the comments on Danika Stegeman’s poem “Panacea,” a discussion started about “moves” in contemporary poetry, and I mentioned that I’d seen the poet Elisa Gabbert start pretty awesome discussions about “moves” on her own blog and on the Ploughshares blog. Then she posted the following comment: “Hi Mike, I have definitely talked about moves before, moves I like and moves I don’t like and my own signature moves, but haven’t made a real list, certainly not a comprehensive list, certainly not the DEFINITIVE list. Let me know if you want to collaborate on a list of moves for HTMLGiant.”\n\nWell, I thought that sounded like a terrific idea. So here it is, our stab at cataloging 41 popular moves in “contemporary poetry,” an exercise that’s fraught with peril, what with the competing definitions, camps, roles, and processes of “contemporary poetry,” the nebulousness of calling something a “move,” the inevitable non-definitiveness of such a list, and so on, but hey: dancing is fraught with peril too, and no one’s managed to stop me from doing that. So here we go. 41 moves. With mildly related pictures! In no particular order! Please argue and add in the comments. Many thanks to Elisa Gabbert for the bulk of the work on this list.\n\n1) Exposed revision\n\nExample: Alice Fulton’s “About Face“:\n\nAt least embarrassment is not an imitation.\n\nIt’s intimacy for beginners,\n\nthe orgasm no one cares to fake.\n\nI almost admire it. I almost wrote despise.\n\n1b) Variation: Revision by way of “I mean”\n\nExample: “Confession” by Suzanne Wise:\n\nExample: Jack Gilbert’s “Searching for Pittsburgh”:\n\nThe rusting mills sprawled gigantically\n\nalong three rivers. The authority of them.\n\n3) Abstract epistolary: Using “Dear [abstraction or common object]” in the title or first line.\n\nExamples: Countless. Dear Body: by Dan Machlin, “Dear Final Journey,” by Lynn Emanuel, which begins, “Dear Noose, Dear Necktie, Dear Cravat”\n\nExamples:From “Marriage Proposal” by Sarah Messer: “I want to be trapped by the cage of your ribs”\n\nFrom “Synchronized Swimming” by Angela Sorby: “How did decay work its way into the theater of water”\n\nFrom “I want you to see me” by Kate Greenstreet: “Red and blue and the white of my transparency”\n\nExamples:\n\nFrom “Mezzotint for A” by Ben Lerner: “My better half had left me so I wrote her hemi- / stiches in the half-light of my halfway house, etc.”Jessica Fjeld’s On Animate Life: Its Profligacy, Organ Meats, Etc.\n\n6) Verbing a noun or other nonverb\n\nExamples:From “[when you touch down upon this earth.little reindeers”] by D.A. Powell: “little reindeers / hoofing murderously”\n\nFrom Scape by Joshua Harmon: “perceiving only how vertigo / secretaries me into the office”\n\nExamples:From Farrah Field’s “Things Are Starting to Look Up Again”: “Is it possible / to completely cover someone’s body with semen.”\n\nFrom C.D. Wright’s “Scratch Music”: “How many threads have I broken with my teeth.”\n\nExamples: “What He Thought” by Heather McHugh\n\nAnd poetry—\n\n(we’d all\n\nput down our forks by now, to listen to\n\nthe man in gray; he went on\n\nsoftly)—\n\npoetry is what\n\nhe thought, but did not say.\n\n9) The reversal of size, expectation, etc.\n\nExample: “Ready-Made Bouquet” by Dean Young\n\nThe despair\n\nof loving may lead to long plane rides with\n\nlittle leg room, may lead to a penis full\n\nof fish, a burning chicken, a room filled\n\nwith a single, pink rose. Funny, how\n\nwe think of it as a giant rose,\n\nnot a tiny room.\n\nExamples:From “Brazilian Groom: Dream No. 1” by Kathleen Rooney: “The window? Open. / The curtains? Flung wide.”\n\nFrom “Panopticon” by Brenda Shaughnessy:\n\nExample: From “Snow” by David Berman: “Our voices hung close in the new acoustics.”\n\nExample: “At Peter Pan Mini Golf After the Wedding of Rebecca and Brian, Or Any Binary System” by Dan Boehl:\n\nI could say this guy was like Spicoli,\n\nor I could say this guy was like Sean Penn,\n\nand both would be wrong because really\n\nthis guy is like a guy that works weekends\n\nfor the family mini-golf business.\n\nExamples:From “My Ravine” by Dan Chiasson: “How will you know what my poem is like / until you’ve gone down my ravine”\n\nFrom “Vermont” by Dan Chiasson: “I was the west / once. I was paradise.”\n\nFrom “Why I Am White” by Mathias Svalina: “I wasn’t going to tell you about my boats, / but now I want to tell you about my boats.”\n\nExample: From “The Vandals” by Alan Michael Parker: “In the poem about the vandals, the vandals / Back their Dodge 4 x 4 up to the door”\n\nExample: From “Only So Much Fits in a Petri Dish” by Julia Cohen & Mathias Svalina:\n\nWhen the tree climbs down its bark, I follow\n\nseedlings buried in cake. I’ve hidden the sin in roofing,\n\nde-veined by a plum falling from the child’s hand.\n\nA wolf of her own.\n\nExample: From “Kasmir” by Jon Leon: “I’m sort of in a dunebuggy”\n\nExamples:From “On Old Ideas” by Dorothea Lasky: “O the lovely bankteller, like a moose he / Rode my spirit quite outside my clothes”\n\nFrom “John Albertson in the Summer Sun” by Dorothea Lasky: “O John Albertson, you are so summery / In the summer sun.”\n\nExample: Many from Tao Lin’s You Are a Little Bit Happier Than I Am, e.g. “book reviewers always praise books as ‘life-affirming’ because the more humans there are on earth the better”\n\nExample: From “Let’s Say” by Bob Perelman: “A page is being beaten / back across the face of ‘things.'”\n\nExample: From “Within This Book, Called Marguerite” by Marjorie Welish: “As time separates us / from the evaporating architectonics to sweeten mythopoetic / substances, you start to count heroically, / hurled down upon a profile of an as yet / unrevealed know-how.”\n\nExamples: From “November Elegy” by Mary Jo Bang:\n\nFrom “She Remembers His Hat” by Mary Jo Bang:\n\nFrom “Small on Sunday” by Jennifer Knox:\n\nFrom “Autobiographia” by Karl Parker:\n\nExample: From “Evelyn’s Kitchen” by Shafer Hall (last stanza):\n\nExample: From “Poems for Everyone” by Matt Shears: “Cocktails, little forgotten disasters, Lunesta®.”\n\nExample: From “While You Were Watching Richard Harris” by Ben Mazer: “Simple patter, nothing to write home.”\n\nExample: From “Autobiographia” by Karl Parker: “life is scared. Dogs only rarely eat other dogs”\n\nExamples:\n\nFrom “Situation in Yellow” by Stephanie Anderson: “She does not take paper / clips or protractors.”\n\nFrom “This Is Not About Pears” by Matthew Hittinger: “whole sections left white, not blank, / but the white where light lifts form / into pears (even though this is not / about pears).”\n\nFrom “Lessons in Stalking” by Michele Battiste: “Caveat: This is not a charted series of locations. This is not some coded spygame—pubescent, discarded, outgrown. This is not about getting close or being loved.”\n\nExamples:\n\nFrom “Autobiographia” by Karl Parker: “That was prettymuch the story of my life”"
