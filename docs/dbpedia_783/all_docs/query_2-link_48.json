        "text": "Meena Alexander\n\nI was moved by the poem by J.P.Dancing Bear (though I did not know the poet’s name then)–the lyric grace, the sweet snout of elegy, the fecund redness, then utter pallor of it. The loss flickered in me. A poem I had already started writing, over a year ago, or rather lines of it I picked up from my notebook and worked so it made its own music. This I sent for the telephone project.\n\nCatherine Barnett\n\nA recent study by Daniel Schachter at Harvard says that we can’t imagine the future without being able to remember the past. I was struck by the epigraph of my precursor’s poem (unknown to me at the time), the line from Sappho: “Can you forget what happened before?” The speaker in my poem was hoping to enliven the past in order to rewrite the future.\n\nTara Betts\n\nWhen I first read the poem that inspired mine, I was definitely thinking about a topic that I don’t typically address in my poetry—birds. I wanted to link the poems by using a variation on the last line “diving flocks. Like sparks.” The other image that kept coming back to me was the image of birds that had been falling out of the sky in large numbers in early 2011. It made me think of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, and how pollutants permeate everything in microscopic levels that accumulate and grow into a damaging presence. Each line came like a breath, another chance like numbers of a lottery ticket.\n\nPaula Bohince\n\nMeena’s “Sung (Lacking Words)” is exquisite. I read her poem many times, letting its pacing and images wash over me. I felt myself responding to the emergency she presents, made slow and beautiful by her dream-like timing. Her “hand flourishes” made me think of birds flying to and from a hand, which set my poem going. I also engaged with her “Hands grasp at dew// Which is what my flesh turned to.” I tried to be deliberate with my poem’s birds changing into fruit, then fire, then angels, and back to fire. The final return to fire refers to Meena’s poem, which so elegantly has the last stanza echoing the second. Her unanswerable question mid-poem is a moment I gave to mine. I also think that her fantastic use of “somehow” at her poem’s beginning tilted my poem toward its eventual form.\n\nJenny Browne\n\nWhen I received Gerald Maa’s poem, I was not familiar with Casaubon, but I was drawn to the larger questions his poem considered about bodies and books, and how we spend our time. I was particularly drawn to the line: I saw I could only be a simile for my past self /I fear. This led me to a memory of once reading an old book on the side of a young mountain, and on downhill from there.\n\nStephen Burt\n\nWhen I received Juliana’s contribution (not knowing, of course, that it was Juliana’s) I knew that I wanted to write a poem with sounds and speeches that crossed in the night, with unknown (or vatic or superhuman or mysterious) sources, like the misaligned telephone calls (a literal “telephone poem”) in Juliana’s contribution. I also wanted an excuse to do something long and something a bit uncontrolled compared to the poems that I had been writing, or not writing. And I had been thinking a lot about Belmont, about Rock Creek Park (near where I grew up), about the suburbs at night, about how to make suburbs interesting, and about how to find time to do any writing at all (we have recently had our second child: he’s seven months old, super-cute, and will probably wake up before I finish this paragraph). So those are the ingredients, if you like. I suppose the poem is a sequel to the last poem I wrote with anything like that length and that attitude, which is also in part about Rock Creek Park, “Brief History of North American Youth,” finished five or six years ago. Time, like owls, can fly, especially when it’s too dark to see.\n\nKathryn Stripling Byer\n\nStaring at Alison Benis White’s poem, wondering what I’d gotten myself into with this project, I began to see images from my beloved aunt’s recent open casket bursting in my eyes, like firecrackers. The red painted lips, the blouse with its small buttons, beneath which I could barely see the bulge of the inoperable tumor. The line, “Every word but mouthed erased, ” pointed toward the poem’s culmination, or so I realize now. Without Alison’s poem, I could never have unbuttoned this outcry of grief and incomprehension at the physical reality of her death.\n\nSophie Cabot Black\n\nHow I wanted to write about those horses! I am always tending horses, hence they sneak into everything in my life. But I held off, and, landed first on the title–always wanting more time = wanting time to stand still–how that speaks now to our age of more and more. And too I loved the formality presented by what came down the right hand side of the telephone line (the poem I got to see then: now that all is revealed–how delightful to have the writer matched to the piece–and too to see what came to follow after mine).\n\nSometimes when reading, (hopefully most times), one is transported–so this was where I let myself begin with the blank page of carrying on this game of telephone, this string of poems, into where I knew not. It was great fun and I know that had it been another day something very different would have happened, and I wonder what that means too. And now having read the whole enterprise, do I sense a circling back? If we let this business of poem after poem (in visual art it is called The Exquisite Corpse, no?) go on a little longer, I now wonder would the images come back to themselves, the entire project as some full circle, or perhaps instead an uncoiling spiral…\n\nPeter Campion\n\nMy process moves at different rates at the same time. This time, there were the immediate questions the telephone project uncovered for me: How can the speech of the poem be collective and singular? What action does the poem perform in relation to other poems? Who are you talking to? The very word “who,” from this last (ungrammatical) question got into my ear, thanks to Steve Burt’s owl. This returned me to a line I tried, and failed, to thread into a poem almost ten years ago: “the who you talk to when you’re talking to yourself.” I was also working at the time on a series titled “Salt Water.” All of these directions led me to the poem I contributed.\n\nJennifer Chang\n\nWhen I received the assignment from At Length, I was in the midst of a several-months-long doctor-ordered bed rest due to pregnancy complications. Which is to say, I was a sorry lump in Ohio. I was reading a lot of Frank O’Hara then to keep my mind focused and my spirits up, but it was no use. I kept finding laments – tiny in size, vast in meaning – in every poem. “There should be / so much more, not of orange, of / words, of how terrible orange is / and life” – that’s what I’d say to my veggie burger, my dog, my stubborn belly. And then I got David Caplan’s poem, an observation of a child, the last lines of which articulated the prayer I’d yet to utter “O my little one, O my forever.” His poem humbled me, made me sadder and braver. From this experience, words slowly began to trickle out. I don’t know what my poem is. A record of how my reading intersected with the rhythms of my days and feelings, an utterance forced out in order to combat the silence of the future, a wish for any future that’s not too grievous. Maybe it’s just a sad ditty. I’ve since renamed the poem “Let’s Name Our Son after Frank O’Hara.”\n\nJ.P. Dancing Bear\n\nWhen I first received Kathryn Stripling Byer’s poem, “Look”, there were certain images and ideas that struck me and I felt I could have a conversation with this poem. That I could write from the perspective of a dead woman. There’s so much in our culture about the sensitivities around death and the dead, but there’s also the aspect of having to let go and to move on and what you carry forward. I enjoyed being a contributor to the project; it reminded me that I used to write poems that conversed with other poems a long time ago.\n\nJoanne Diaz\n\nWhen I received David Yezzi’s poem, I was reading about the work of Atsuko Tanaka, a magnificent Japanese avant-garde artist whose most famous piece is The Electric Dress, which I write about here. I knew what was drawing me toward this material—Tanaka’s fascination with and fear of technology—but I didn’t know how to start the poem. When I read David Yezzi’s last line, I was delighted. It’s a daring move to end a poem with a speculation, and I thought it might be an interesting way to start mine. For me, then, this was a very generative exercise.\n\nRoss Gay\n\nIt has been long enough since I’d written this poem, and written it in some kind of response to Jennifer Kronovet’s piece, that I’ve lost track entirely of how I was tethering mine to hers–though that seems fine. Her poem feels especially exciting and weird to me now, and moreso due to my connection to it, which is there but kind of gone. On the other hand, to read Hix’s piece right after feels like the way I like to read a poem (and do sometimes out loud, by myself, talking right back to it: “Really? You think so?”)–his response is so sharp and kind of funny. The project allowed that little sweet wall that sometimes we put around poems to be kicked over–and now I can see my poem a little more clearly, truth be told. It seems, from reading these poems, which are pretty damn good and real different from each other, too, to be a good game to play. And fun.\n\nKimiko Hahn\n\nI am familiar with telephone-style poetry collaborations from renga, Japanese linked verse. I was eager to try this more open approach–and honored to be the one kicking it all off. What did that mean? As Jonathan described, he gave me a Sappho fragment for starters. Jim Powell’s translation, Sappho: A Garland (FSG, 1993) came to mind because years ago I had tried (unsuccessfully) to mimic those translations, using his open and closed brackets. I tried to hang on to those mysterious windows that the damage had left us. Jonathan was giving me the opportunity to resurrect that wish. But I digress! Aside from that initial and personal delight, I wanted for this opening piece a text that would be sharp and magical, but also giving. I hoped to leave ample resonance so those who linked up would enter an open system. I think that’s what I was thinking. Oh, and I am irritated by the closed-systems religious institutions and I hoped to convey that. All this was done with a deadline. (More!)\n\nErnest Hilbert\n\nKristina Jipson’s poem “and Sharply” is a tranquil, meditative poem that inspired me to think of photographic processing from the age of the silver gelatin print, an art and craft that seem oddly remote to the age of instant “photographs” captured on phones and directly uploaded to social media sites and blogs where they may be witnessed by any number of viewers. (Her poem does not actually describe photographic development, though her description of “tin trays with water” into which paper is “slowly dipped” sent me in that direction.) The care and attention required to develop a photograph (or at the very least drop it off for development and then drive to pick it up again), placed certain demands on a photographer. A photograph cost money and time to bring to its final state, so one was, understandably, selective when closing the shutter.\n\nAround the time I read “and Sharply,” I was directed to a website called Internet K-Hole. Urban Dictionary defines an “Internet K-Hole” as “the place you go when you have been surfing the internet mindlessly for too long and lose track of time or what you are doing.” The website itself offers the slogan “endless photos of strangers.” If that intrigues you, then welcome to the age of voyeurism without consequences. Privacy has been abolished. The pornographic resonance of the name Internet K-Hole is not entirely misleading. It is a website on which tens of thousands of photographs from the pre-digital age have been scanned and uploaded in no particular order and without annotation. The images date back to the 1960s and begin to taper off in the 1990s, as digital photography became more prevalent. The subjects of the photos are often “partying,” sometimes in a state of partial or complete undress, smoking pot, drinking beer, mugging and posing for the cameras, generally “letting themselves go.” The terminal line of Jipson’s poem describes a “sun like a hole in the sky, burning,” and so I felt that two loose intuitive filaments had found purchase. A web would soon emerge.\n\nMy first impression upon scanning through the photographs on Internet K-Hole was that I had lifted a cool rock and found a lair teeming with pill bugs. They had been hidden safely down in the protected soil, and I had suddenly aerated their den and exposed them to killing sunlight. Oh, those awful haircuts. Oh, all that wasted time, wasted brain cells. Did people really look like that? Did I? Can’t we just leave it all behind us? Oh, the mercy of oblivion! The photographs on Internet K-Hole were never meant to be “shared” the way digital shots are now or the way in which they are, in fact, now shared on that very site. They were taken for a small group of participants or for a single viewer, who perhaps never intended to share them at all. Yet here they are, pinned up for the world to see. The subjects have since aged, or even died. Surely few if any of the subjects are aware that their photographs have been so rudely exposed to the public.\n\nI decided to reply with an expansive, maximalist gesture, a puffing of the chest. I used the exuberant, wild, popular American dynamism found in Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O’Hara, and John Ashbery. I went full adolescent. I wanted the poem to be big, brawny, as obnoxious as the characters on Internet K-Hole. I wanted it to sprawl and loaf like the boundlessly abundant photographs. It’s a poem about the noise of the modern age. It’s about the death of privacy. It’s about memory. But it is not angry. It’s in the comic mode, a goof. It’s nostalgic. I wanted it to be unabashed, out of bounds, too big for its own good, gawky, feral, vulgar, excited, and, finally, innocent. The website Internet K-Hole is a kaleidoscopic imprint of recent history. It is delightful, shocking, and fun. I can only hope my poem of the same name, conjured from its spirit, can match it.\n\nH.L. Hix\n\nIt happened that on the day I received this poem I was reading Don Mee Choi’s new book, The Morning News Is Exciting. One of the poems in it, “Instructions from the Inner Room,” has this explanatory note attached: “In pre-modern Korea, self-educated, upper-class women wrote instructional poem-songs (kyubang kasa) that were mainly passed down from woman to woman, mother to daughter. These poems, usually recorded in vernacular Korean, hangul, spoke of family genealogy, proper conduct, duty and obedience to husbands, in-laws, and parents.” Inspired by the fortuitous juxtaposition of two very different poems, each attentive to the mother, I tried to write “The Mother” backward, line by line, after the manner of Choi’s take on the instructional poem-song.\n\nKristina Jipson\n\nI got very excited as a teenager once about a “mailbox project” that involved swapping prompts and response poems with some friends through a complicated three-mailbox system–I think the idea was that each box would receive both outgoing and ingoing mail, one dispatching to the next, and then somehow the collaborative project would be compiled in a sort of multiply-stamped scrapbook. I collage-decorated the boxes. I cut fat holes in the top of them in case people decided to send books, pictures, objects from the natural world! instead of their own writing. Then I hung the boxes from strings from my bedroom ceiling. Surely I had talked about this plan with my would-be collaborators? But somehow the the whole thing crashed before it got started at the first reveal of my overwrought boxes. People squirmed. They’d have to think about what to send. Meanwhile, I sent myself a black and white picture of a house on a hill. I wrote a poem with featuring the word clapboard in response. I put the poem and the picture in an envelope, then I put the envelope in a little box with some jacks in it. And so on. It turned out I was the creative tyrant of a postal system for one. Many years later, with considerably less time to paste little pieces of tissue paper into star-patterns on the lids of mailboxes on my bedroom floor, I was grateful for the opportunity to imagine some sort of chain to write into (though as I hemmed and hawed about how to do it, I got some sense of how my poor friends must have felt!). Jonathan’s plan is thankfully less bedazzled than my teenage one, but it seems steeped in the same sort of optimism I remember feeling about people slipping one another little envelopes of inspiration, and in that way making something new together. And how fun that, this time, the mail was sent, it was received, it was sent again!\n\nA. Van Jordan\n\nI decided to title my response with a line from the poem I was given. In my mind, I thought, if we were on the phone and talking about relationships, what might come up. In this sense, the only confession I had to offer was that my life works in cycles. And then the question, “Does yours?”\n\nJee Leong Koh\n\nReading Sappho translated by Sherrod Santos, I was drawn to the use of fragments to characterize the conflicting feelings after a relationship breaks up. Kimiko Hahn’s defiant poem gave me the wax image. The living room in Idra Novey’s poem is taken over by vagrants, and in my poem taken back by a couple of Giants fans.\n\nJennifer Kronovet\n\nIn college I took an installation art course, and for my final project I decided to travel around Illinois knocking on strangers’ doors and asking them to trade a personal object with me that I would then trade with someone else, some other stranger. I started off with a bracelet a friend had made me out of a bicycle chain. I traded that for a section of the cloth a woman had used to make her baby’s first blanket. I traded that for a small knife one man had used as a child when hunting with his father. I traded that for a music box a woman couldn’t bear to keep.\n\nWhen I received Jason’s poem, I felt like I had to treat it in the same way these participants had treated the objects they received. Jason had looked inside and found this pen. I looked inside and found inside had shifted in the months since I’d become a mother. What could I find in there stable, sculptural enough to give away?\n\nQuinn Latimer\n\nAs Dana Levin’s spare poem—her “lyric echo”—is made up of words gleaned from the poem that preceded hers, my poem too (I see now) was built from words that I less consciously pulled from Matthew Zapruder’s poem: glacier, sisters, blue letters. I had just spent some time in the Alps, and the mountains, their idea and fact, were still very much in my head when I sat down to write. (Along with a quote by W. G. Sebald that I had just read: “My ideal station is possibly a hotel in Switzerland.”) In a way, I used the words I gleaned from Zapruder’s poem for their sound and sonic qualities, though I then put them to different meanings. Like some sort of homophonic translation of English to English, but also of the idea of the US and Iran to the idea of Switzerland, of the domestic interior to the natural, wild exterior. Since the political meaning of Zapruder’s “Poem For Delkash” did not really hit me until I read the poem that inspired his—I am ashamed to say—I was most influenced by his very beautiful, circular, quietly singsong cadences. And even if I was abashed to find I had written a love poem under his and the glacier’s influence, it was cool and somewhat reassuring to find that the entire thread began with a fragment by Sappho herself.\n\nDana Levin\n\nIt seems flamboyant to deem my contribution “by Dana Levin;” it reads to me more as a lyric echo, a partial apparition, of the poem written by Mihaela Moscaliuc, especially as it is comprised almost wholly of her words. At the time I was invited to participate in Telephone I was reading and contemplating fragment and erasure; I couldn’t help but read Mihaela’s Amelie through that lens, and conjured up a ghost.\n\nGerald Maa\n\nWhen given this great opportunity, I had been wanting to write a poem on Middlemarch, inspired by Neil Hertz’s phenomenal essay “Recognizing Casaubon.” For a long while, I had had the beginnings of the first handful of lines, but nothing more than those nascent spots of language. I hoped that the Telephone Project would provide the traction necessary to bring the poem back up to speed and then to its end. When I started I wrote with “Simile” off-stage, way off-stage, I confess. I wrote with hopes that “Simile” would swoop in on its own, and it, with its meditation on paternal tutelage, did—to Brechtian effect, laying bare the gulf between meaning and intention, what I wrote and what I meant to say. And thus poetry begat something poetic in its intentions.\n\nErika Meitner\n\nEd Skoog’s “Smoked Tongue” is an evocative, musical poem and when I read it, I immediately thought: barbecue—barbecue and language—so that’s where I started, but things got shifty pretty quickly. It was the summer of 2012 when I wrote this poem. It was hot. The Olympics were on and Oscar Pistorius was competing. This was before the murder charges and trial. Bryshon Nellum, too, was running in the 4×400 relay on team USA; he had been shot in both legs four years before the games, while walking near USC, when gang members mistook him for someone from a rival gang. My poems have been obsessed with gun violence for a while now, but I had been ruminating on the idea that our screen lives are things that don’t appear nearly enough in poems—television, Internet, Facebook, all of our virtual attachments. These are our new tongues, images, languages. Do I even need to say that my son kept interrupting me while I was trying to write this poem? I gave up, and put him in. I also realize this poem is vaguely apocalyptic, because: Ezekiel.\n\nMarilyn Nelson\n\nMy response started with a line from the previous poem, which I used as a title. I didn’t want to write about erotic relationship; wanted to make a leap to a larger context. The idea of “past relationship” led me to think about the past, about history, about relationships between both individuals and peoples. I used as an epigraph a quote from my translation of one of Rilke’s Duino Elegies. I figured nobody else would be writing in forms, so I wrote in rhymed iambic pentameter.\n\nIdra Novey\n\nI wrote this poem on top of the Sunday paper. After spending some time with the poem before mine in the Telephone Project, I paused to read an article about a street in Cincinnati where half of the homes had been foreclosed. One morning, a woman saw smoke escaping from the foreclosed home next door to her. The complexity of that moment, of a women alone in her house looking out to find the vacant home next door on fire, seemed to have all sorts of curious things to say to the Sappho fragment that had triggered the poem before mine. And so, with a little newspaper ink on my elbows, I started “As in Cincinnati.”\n\nPatrick Rosal\n\nThe process begins actively when the poet receives the preceding fragment, but really the process, for me, began when Jonathan sent an e-mail asking if I’d be a part. Dying’s an old mystery, but for an ex-altar boy like me, mystery is just about everything. So the anticipation of the fragment (i.e. anxiety) informed my reading. Would the piece I receive be long? Will I have to read it closely? Do I have time to read it closely? Do I have anything to say in response? And the most compelling question in my head: I wonder who wrote this? The Telephone Project—the poetry project—is like the game of the same name except all the participants are unknown. For one inclined to devotion (see altar boy reference above), this required a good deal of faith.\n\nWhen I received Catherine Barnett’s fragment, three elements struck me the most: the title, the setting of an art gallery, and white string. I compose often in opposites and when I thought of the art gallery (I didn’t know about Richard Tuttle’s work), I tried to think of a contrasting scene. I just came back from the Philippines, only my third trip in twenty-five-some years and thought of the regular goat slaughter on special occasions, one of them being my arrival to the barrio of Santo Tomás, and the innards piled on a chopping block like thick bright twine. And then I remembered the old man come down from the hills rolling that jug (called a burnay in Ilokano) and how he started jamming with my uncle as the goat was slaughtered.\n\n(The language that emerged from the project has now, since, become another poem, though very similar to its cousin here.)\n\nThe last, and perhaps the most rewarding, part of the process is reading the whole string, as it were. Interesting, the juxtapositions, the apparitions, even the visual shifts from voice to voice. Interesting to do this on e-mail. I think we all grew up during a time when you had to actually “dial” a telephone—and they all had lines.\n\nJason Schneiderman\n\nTelephone was exciting because I was being forced into conversation with a stranger (or as it turned out, someone I know and rather like). It was a thrill to respond to a poem—to be commissioned in effect—to find a footing in someone else’s piece, and then to lay down my own poem as the foothold for the next writer. Writing is lonely. I was recently asked by someone if I’d been in a particular journal, but the question wasn’t in the vein of “I might have read your poem because I read that journal”—it was simply a question of fame. “Have you played Carnegie Hall?” I often get exhausted by how referential life is—how everyone is networking all this knowledge in these artificial ways. It was nice to be worked into a net that’s manageable and tangible. Friendly. Comfortable. Intimate. All the things I like, and of which I don’t get enough.\n\nRoger Sedarat\n\nI have to say, the previous poem did redirect my writing. I’m currently translating a great deal (and teaching translation). Only in retrospect do I realize that the inversion of the bee and beekeeper in the previous poem strikes me in part as what the translator does with the source text (relevant for funeral talk too a la Benjamin’s theory and others of the text dying unless revivified–eulogized?–by another writer/translator).\n\nSS\n\nEvie made me think, again, of the dead and what it means to live beside and behind “done seen too much eyes.” I was thinking about the living beside the memory of trauma. Of epic and state-sanctioned trauma. Of how that shapes our love and what we say to each other over breakfast or in the car or the small spaces we go as those who narrowly survived. I was thinking about the horrors we see and don’t talk about. The horrors our loved ones see that project before us as secondary witnesses. I see we both responded to mother father ghosts. I felt such a kinship with her poem. She cleared my walls of nails for the ghosts to walk through.\n\nEvie Shockley\n\nThe title of the poem I received set me off initially. I’ve been reading and thinking a lot about narratives of slavery and the Middle Passage, so when I saw “Salt Water,” the phrase “salt-water negroes” immediately came to mind. The phrase was once used—largely, I believe, by black folks who were born into slavery here—to describe those still being kidnapped into slavery and brought here from Africa on slaveships at a time when that was no longer a common (or “legal”) way to increase the enslaved population. So while it didn’t seem remarkable that I made this connection, what did surprise me was that I heard the phrase as dialogue; someone had something important to say about “them salt-water negroes.” I didn’t know what that something was right away, but as I lifted other words and phrases from the previous poem and placed them in this new context, the warning—as it turned out to be—soon took shape.\n\nJuliana Spahr\n\nIt felt impossible. And then it felt possible. Which is often what working with others feels like.\n\nJoshua Weiner\n\nThe contrivance of the experiment encouraged me to be loose and have fun, playing with rhetoric and figurative language, contemporary reference, and other formal elements, drawing from the previous installment without too much concern about developing or advancing it. To the contrary, I was provoked by the straight-ahead lyric/narrative to disrupt the presumption of a genuine fictive occasion, while still using some of the terms it established. The need to turn, but to do so within audible bounds, taught me something about style and structure, suture and transition, segue and statement: how does a poet create a world? How does another follow a lead without being beholden to it? The idea that a single poem could make a tradition of its own composition has positive implications for the future of poetic composition, generally.\n\nDavid Yezzi\n\nAfter reading Ernest Hilbert’s “Internet K-Hole,” I went to the website that his poem is based on: internetkhole.blogspot.com and scrolled through the countless forgotten snapshots posted there. What struck me was how many pictures and people there were: something that Hilbert’s maximalist poem gets at very powerfully. Working by contrast, I responded to his sweeping inclusiveness with a kind of minimalism–each line with its own lost history and its own point of view.\n\nMatthew Zapruder\n\nWhen I got the poem, I was intrigued by “Delkash.” I found this video, her voice and the song was so beautiful I couldn’t stop listening to it all day. Something in her voice and his also for some reason produced in me some feelings about all the things I don’t know about all the people standing up in unimaginably difficult situations all over the world.\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nMeena Alexander‘s most recent books are the volume of poetry Quickly Changing River (TriQuarterly Books/ Northwestern Univ Press, 2008) and the essay collection Poetics of Dislocation (Univ. of Michigan Poets on Poetry Series, 2009).
