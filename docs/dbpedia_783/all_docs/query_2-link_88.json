        "text": "PoetsWest Directory: Who's Who in Northwest Poetry\n\nThe PoetsWest Directory includes biographical profiles of well known Northwest poets and those not well enough known. While many of the poets have achieved recognition, PoetsWest also acknowledges the strengths and special gifts of other poets. Like so many of us living in the Pacific Northwest, many poets, especially those of an earlier generation, migrated here from other regions. Poets living and writing in the Northwest are often influenced by the expansive landscape, the water, and the weather (rain, usually). They recognize humanity's ambivalent relationship with the region and are witnesses to the effects of environmental destruction and unchecked urbanization. Their poetry often reveals a spiritual connection to the Native American and Asian cultures. The associations with the environment and other cultures, however, are more contemplative or subconscious, so there is not, as one might expect, a \"regional\" style of poetry. Each poet, including the Native American and Asian American, has his or her own style and distinctive voice. Links to individual web sites are highlighted. The list also includes those who have died. The listing continues to expand as we compile the information.\n\nClick on letter corresponding to last name: A B C D | E F G H I J K L | M N O P Q | R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nZara Raab\n\nA fifth generation Californian, Zara Raab writes from the remote, rural world of her childhood in Mendocino and on the Lost Coast, where her parents attended one room schools.

I then threw them away as I felt they had not reflected maturity as a poet. The habit of writing every day, and producing poems very slowly continues to this day. After almost twenty-five years of so writing, I finally produced thirty poems I wanted to keep. They became my first book of poems, Thirty Poems. One reason I produce slowly is that it is my discipline to subject each poem to about 100 drafts, and then to let the poem set unread for six months to a year at which time I do a last draft and release it. Most of my poems have been influenced by the belief that one of our society's deepest repressions is that of our mortality, and of the sufferings of the poor. Therefore, they are, for the most part, poems of darkness and death. An example would be \"The Children's Corner\" or \"Anne\" from Thirty Poems.\"\n\nThirty Poems, published by Sulphur River Literary Review Press, Austin, Texas, in 1998, was nominated for the 1999 Pulitzer Prize. The book is available from University Book Store in Seattle and Open Books: A Poem Emporium.\n\nJames Scofield's second book of poems, Remember Me, Whispers the Dust (Daniel & Daniel Pub, 2003) consists largely of poems begun during those twenty-six years he talks about.

During that time, I studied poetry at the University of Washington, Cornish College of the Arts and received a bachelors’ degree in English Literature from Stanford University.
