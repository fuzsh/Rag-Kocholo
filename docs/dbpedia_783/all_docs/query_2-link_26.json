        "text": "Review: Origin by Dan Brown, published by Bantam\n\nPosted by writerlywitterer on 27/06/2018 · 7 Comments\n\nReview: Origin by Dan Brown, published by Bantam Hardback edition: £20, ISBN 978-0-5930-7875-4 I have had a firm policy for many years not to be rude about other writers’ work.

In Willis and Ironside I feel I’ve found two writers who can carry me back to the past and can show me a time when, amid the brutality and irrationality of politics, there were still great … Continue reading →\n\nAlibis in the Archives at Gladstone’s Library\n\nPosted by writerlywitterer on 18/06/2018 · 4 Comments\n\nThere are times when writing seems a doddle, and other times when all you want to do is sit down and write, but these other things get in the way … I was very grateful to be invited to the annual Alibis in the Archive event, part of Gladfest at the Gladstone Library. For one … Continue reading →"
