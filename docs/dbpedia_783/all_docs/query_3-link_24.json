        "text": "Sarah Kirsch is without doubt one of Germany's most acclaimed contemporary poets, a fact which was endorsed in October of 1996 when she was awarded the prestigious Büchner prize for literature. Over three decades of writing she has developed a unique lyrical style which depends heavily on imagery from the natural world to express themes ranging from the political to the personal. Her poetry has won many admirers throughout the German-speaking world and beyond.\n\nThis book is intended both as an introduction for the general reader and as a resource for the specialist. It contains new poems written by Sarah Kirsch during her stay as writer in residence at the Centre for Contemporary German Literature in Swansea, together with a short interview and a full bibliography. The five contributions by Welsh and English academics cover aspects of her work from the early DDR anthologies of poems right up to the short prose collections of the present day. To complement these essays the book also includes two personal accounts of their reactions to Kirsch's work, one by the poet Günter Kunert and one by the literary critic Heinz Ludwig Arnold.\n\nMererid Hopwood is a Welsh poet, who became in 2001 the first woman to win the bardic Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales. She has also won the Crown (in 2003) and the Prose Medal (2008), making her the only woman to have won all three of the major Eisteddfodd prozes."
