        "text": "Class of 2021 Indiana recruiting target Mason Miller announced his commitment to Creighton on Monday night.\n\nMiller, a 6-foot-9 forward from Houston High School in Germantown (Tenn.), made the announcement via social media just after 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe son of former NBA forward Mike Miller, Mason Miller is the No. 65 player nationally according to the 247Composite. Indiana’s major tie to Miller was associate head coach Tom Ostrom’s relationship with Mike Miller.\n\nMike Miller played at Florida while Ostrom worked as an administrative assistant and video coordinator under Billy Donovan.\n\nLast week, Mason Miller spoke highly of his relationship and potential fit with Creighton in an interview with Inside the Hall.\n\n“I love their offense,” Miller said of the Bluejays. “They have a good offensive build, shooting a lot of threes and getting a lot of shots up. I like that a lot. And also the coaches there. They’re nice, too.”\n\nWhile the Hoosiers were considered a top contender to land Miller’s commitment over the last couple of months, he never made it to campus for a visit due to the NCAA’s recent decision to extend the recruiting dead period through April.\n\nRecently, Indiana conducted a series of virtual meetings with Miller and his family in place of the in-person visits.\n\nOn the other hand, Miller was able visit Creighton this fall and had the opportunity to see the program’s downtown arena, the CHI Health Center, which isn’t on the school’s campus.\n\nAs a junior at Houston High School, Miller helped lead his program to a state championship game appearance before the season was canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nLosing out on Miller is the latest recruiting miss for Indiana coach Archie Miller, who also struck out on top target Trey Kaufman (Purdue) in late October. Indiana currently only has one player – Logan Duncomb – committed in the class of 2021.\n\nWhere the Hoosiers turn next recruiting wise in the frontcourt is a major question mark.\n\nIt’s conceivable that Indiana will lose both Joey Brunk and Trayce Jackson-Davis after this season, which could leave the depth chart in the post severely lacking.\n\nIndiana may have to turn to the transfer market next spring, which is expected to be very active. The NCAA could grant transfers immediate eligibility for the 2021-2022 season, meaning that the transfer portal could act as a defacto free agent market in college basketball."
