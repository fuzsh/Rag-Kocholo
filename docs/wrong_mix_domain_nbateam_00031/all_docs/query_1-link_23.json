        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies were a small part of Jerry West's 60-plus years of basketball excellence, but his five seasons helped shift the narrative on NBA basketball in the Bluff City.\n\nWest, who died Wednesday at the age of 86, was one of the NBA's greatest players and executives.\n\n“The Grizzlies organization is saddened by the news of Jerry West’s passing and sends our deepest condolences to his wife Karen, his family and his friends across the NBA,\" the Grizzlies said in a statement. \"West’s profound impact on the NBA and the sport of basketball as a whole cannot be overstated. We are particularly appreciative of his efforts in Memphis, where he was a meaningful part of the community and served from 2002 to 2007 as president of basketball operations.”\n\nBetween Vancouver and Memphis, the Grizzlies franchised failed to win more than 23 games in their first seven NBA seasons. Memphis won 28 games in West's first season, then that total jumped to 50 wins in 2003-04, leading to West winning the NBA's Executive of the Year Award.\n\nOne of West's first splash decisions in Memphis was when he traded away top-five pick Drew Gooden during his rookie season for a return that included Mike Miller. The risky move worked out for Memphis. Miller went on to be a key contributor during the 50-win season, and he won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2006.\n\n\"Jerry West is a legend of the game of basketball and life in all facets,\" Miller said in a statement. \"I have so many vivid memories with Jerry while he served as General Manager for the Memphis Grizzlies. I'm proud to have been on the team Jerry built to lead the Grizzlies franchise to their first ever playoff berth. I will always remember Jerry for his consistent focus while enjoying life to the fullest. My prayers go out to the West family and I hope hoopers that pick up an NBA ball in the future are no stranger of Jerry's legacy.\"\n\nHUBIE BROWN TALKS JERRY WEST: Hubie Brown reflects on Jerry West's 'God-given talent' as Memphis Grizzlies, NBA general manager\n\nFormer Grizzlies forward James Posey was signed before the 2003-04 season and was another key component to the 50-win team. Posey had his best season and arguably the most productive year of his career that season in Memphis. He averaged a career-high 13.7 points and finished third for the NBA's Most Improved Player Award.\n\nPosey made an Instagram post, thanking West for believing in him."
