        "text": "Mason Miller, a four-star forward who is ranked No. 2 in Tennessee and No. 65 overall in the Class of 2021 according to the 247Sports Composite, committed to Creighton on Monday.\n\nHe is the son of former Memphis assistant and current Houston High coach Mike Miller.\n\n\"I love the play style and it's only like an hour away from my dad's side of the family, so that's good,\" Mason Miller said. \"And they've brought in some good players for my class.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-9 senior picked the Blue Jays over Indiana, which was the other finalist in his top two. He is the highest rated commitment in Creighton's 2021 class, which includes four-star point guards TyTy Washington and Ryan Nembhard and three-star shooting guard John Chistofilis.\n\nCreighton's 2021 recruiting class is ranked 29th nationally and sixth in the Big East. That ranking could improve with the addition of Miller.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who played with Mike Miller in Miami, tweeted \"Congrats nephew!!!\" to Mason followed by emojis of an arm flexing, praying hands, and a crown.\n\nHoops Preview: Memphis area high school boys basketball: Three bold predictions and 20 players to watch in 2020\n\nCoach Mike: Former Memphis assistant Mike Miller hired as Houston boys basketball coach\n\nMiller said that he sees himself playing small forward for the Blue Jays and fitting in well with the offensive system.\n\n\"Creighton shoots a lot of threes and have a lot of movement passing the ball,\" Miller said. \"That's the kind of team I really work well with.\"\n\nHe said Creighton was one of the first schools to start recruiting him.\n\n\"It definitely helped with them being there from day one. I knew them the most,\" said Miller.\n\nHe was the top-ranked prospect in Tennessee until LSU center signee Jerrell Colbert transferred to Houston in September. With two of the nation's top 100 prospects, the Mustangs are among the favorites in Class AAA this season.\n\nMiller was a second-team All-Metro selection last season and helped Houston reach its first boys basketball state tournament berth since the school opened in 1989. But the tournament was canceled due to COVID 19.\n\nHouston opened the season with an 82-59 win over Olive Branch last week."
