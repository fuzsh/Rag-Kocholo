Smith Spotted in Nike Ambassador 7 PEs »\n\nApr 3, 2015 at 4:08 pm | ambassador-vii • shoes\n\nThe Nike Ambassador series, which in my mind is a true take-down LeBron James’ signature shoe (not the Soldier!) could be also considered as Mike Miller’s own. Every now and them… about once a year… King James wears it in an NBA game and that’s how world knows they exist. But it’s Mike who actually […]\n\nMike Miller’s Nike Ambassador 6 Memphis Grizzlies PE »\n\nMar 13, 2014 at 3:22 pm | ambassador-vi • shoes\n\nDespite switching teams Mike Miller has remained loyal to LeBron James’ signature collection. During his days as a member of the Miami Heat he usually laced up Ambassadors including a set of special NBA Finals PEs marking his memorable “I can still shoot three’s even with only one shoe” performance. Now he’s playing for the […]\n\nMike Miller’s Nike Air Max Ambassador 5 NBA Finals PEs »\n\nJul 9, 2013 at 6:03 pm | ambassador-v • shoes\n\nMike Miller went through a couple of pairs of the Nike Air Max Ambassador 5 during the 2013 NBA Finals. His shoes made headlines following the Game 6 when he lost his left shoe during the game and moments later calmly drilled a three-pointer. Here’s a detailed look at the Home and Away edition of […]\n\n@M33M’s Ambassador 5’s and Birdman’s LeBron X Finals PEs »\n\nJun 26, 2013 at 1:35 pm | ambassador-v • shoes\n\nDuring the 2013 NBA Finals many players wore LeBron James’ signature shoes. This included the Spurs’ Danny Green and Manu Ginobili, the Heat’s Mike Miller and Chris Andersen, and of course King James himself. Mike Miller made headlines following Game 6 when he lost his left shoe while battling for rebounding position, but then jogged […]\n\nJames Wears Red Foams Postgame & Equips Team LeBron in Game 7 »\n\nJun 4, 2013 at 1:17 pm | around-the-nba • lebron-james\n\nMost of the Miami Heat squad wore all red or predominantly red kicks in Game 7. This includes LeBron James with his LEBRON X PS Elite Home PE, Chris Andersen with one of James’ LEBRON X Player Exclusives, Norris Cole with the Ohio State edition of the Nike Zoom Soldier VI and Mike Miller in […]\n\nWearing Brons: Cavs and Bledsoe’s new Soldier 6 PEs and More! »\n\nDec 22, 2012 at 3:59 am | shoes • zoom-soldier-vi\n\nLast week we mentioned about various LeBron X sightings around the NBA. A week has passed and seems like half of the league is already wearing LeBron James’ latest team shoes – the Nike Zoom Soldier VI. Apart from basic Team Bank styles, several players have sported Player Exclusive colorways including Daniel Gibson and Tristan […]\n\nWearing Brons: Nate, Bledsoe, Miller, Jones – Nike LeBron 8 »\n\nJan 27, 2011 at 4:45 am | lebron-viii • shoes\n\nWe usually get to see a lot of the Soldier wearings on both NBA and College basketball courts, but the main signature shoe is mostly worn by King James himself. Still, there are some players in the NBA that have been wearing The Eight this season. Some of them are LBJ’s Miami Heat teamates – […]\n\nWearing Brons – More Nike Soldier 3’s and First LBJ7 Sighting »\n\nJan 19, 2010 at 10:21 am | shoes • zoom-soldier-iii\n\nLast month, we posted a “Wearing Brons” report featuring several NBA players wearing LeBron James’ Nike Zoom Soldier III.
