        "text": "CREIGHTON forward Mason Miller is best known as the son of former NBA star Mike Miller – but he is determined to make a name for himself.\n\nMason has big shoes to fill, with his dad reaching the 2000 NCAA title game with Florida before going on to win two NBA titles alongside LeBron James with the Miami Heat.\n\nBut Mason is eager to become a star in his own right.\n\nWhen the pair traveled to the Pangos All-American Basketball Camp in Los Angeles in 2019, Mason asked his dad to walk in 10 minutes after him.\n\n“He didn’t want the other players to know I’m his dad. He wants to be his own man,\" Mike told the Argus Leader.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward joined Creighton in 2021 as a redshirt player and gradually worked his way into the team in the 2022-23 season.\n\nHe played just seven minutes in the March Madness tournament opener against North Carolina before departing with an ankle injury.\n\nMason has been out with a shoulder injury this season but when he has been fit, he has been in top form hitting 45.5% of his threes.\n\nHe is now working his way to get back to his best as Creighton prepares for a run at March Madness.\n\n“It definitely feels a little bit better,” Mason said of his shoulder injury.\n\n“I’m still doing stuff with it, trying to get it better.\n\n\"I’ve just had to kind of work on my shoulder a little bit, kind of strain to the outside rotator cuff, but it’s feeling a lot better now...\"\n\nAs the son of an NBA veteran, Mason had some incredible experiences growing up – including playing video games with future MVP Nikola Jokic in Denver.\n\n“He’s a great dude,” Mason told the Denver Gazette.\n\n“He’s really a kid, honestly. That’s what everyone said, that he’s a kid.\n\n\"And I didn’t believe it until I saw him, but he really is.”"
