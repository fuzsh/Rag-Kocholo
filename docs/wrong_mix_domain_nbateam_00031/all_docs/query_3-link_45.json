        "text": "Yet another former Magic guard will be on the bench at the University of Memphis next season.\n\nMike Miller, who played for Orlando from 2000 to 2004, will join Penny Hardaway’s coaching staff, according to reports.\n\nWho’s Penny calling next? Scott Skiles? Darrell Armstrong? Elfrid Payton?\n\nMiller, who played at the University of Florida, was drafted by the Magic with the fifth pick in the 2000 NBA Draft. He was named Rookie of the Year after averaging 11.9 points and 4.0 rebounds. In two-plus seasons with the Magic, Miller averaged 14.1 points and shot 38 percent from three before being traded in 2003 as part of a deal for Gordan Giriceck and Drew Gooden.\n\nMiller played for seven teams during his 17-year career, including seven seasons as a member of the Memphis Grizzlies, where he was named Sixth Man of the Year in 2005-2006. He captured two titles playing alongside LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. Miller spent 20 games with the Denver Nuggets during the 2016-2017 season before being waived."
