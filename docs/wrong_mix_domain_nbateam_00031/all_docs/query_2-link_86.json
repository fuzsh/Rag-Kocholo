        "text": "LAS VEGAS — U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said three days wasn’t enough time to evaluate everyone properly during the team's weekend minicamp.\n\nThe Americans already decided not to drop anyone from the roster this weekend, but the makeup of the team could emphasize defense and shooting.\n\nAll 17 players will be invited back when the team reconvenes on Aug. 13, though not all are expected to return. Also, Greg Oden will join the squad at that point if he is recovered from his tonsillectomy.\n\nThe roster must be trimmed to 12 before the FIBA Americas tournament begins Aug. 22. The Americans must finish in the top two to clinch a berth in the 2008 Olympics.\n\nBoth Krzyzewski and USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo have said Kevin Durant has a real shot the make the team, and the No. 2 pick in the draft was superb in the second half of Sunday's intrasquad game, when he scored 16 of his 22 points.\n\nBoth teams worked on the zone defense that assistant coach Jim Boeheim, who uses one of the NCAA’s best at Syracuse, put in. The Americans have struggled against it in recent years because of shaky perimeter shooting, but former Gator Mike Miller could make a big difference because of his 3-point shooting.\n\nHe was third in the NBA in 3-pointers made last season, and looked comfortable behind the international 3-point stripe that at 20 feet, 6.1 inches, is more than 3 feet closer than the NBA distance. He hit four 3-pointers and scored 17 points in the second quarter, giving the white team a 56-49 lead at halftime.\n\nKobe Bryant, however, remains the biggest NBA star in Las Vegas.\n\nBryant scored 26 points, including the go-ahead jumper with 6.6 seconds left, to lead the blue team to a 105-104 victory.\n\nFive months after he was the MVP of the All-Star game here, Bryant took over down the stretch in his long-awaited first game in a USA jersey. He scored seven points in the final 2 minutes, including a 3-pointer over LeBron James that tied the game at 101 after the blue trailed by double digits earlier in the fourth quarter.\n\nBryant also forced James into a tough shot at the buzzer that missed.\n\nCarmelo Anthony picked up where he left off last year, when he was the best U.S. player at the world championships, scoring 28 points.\n\nJames scored 18 for the white.\n\nThe game occasionally broke down into a series of fast breaks, but the play of the game came on defense. Bryant was attempting a reverse layup or dunk on a fast break in the third quarter when James jumped to block the shot as it was leaving Bryant’s hands, knocking Bryant to the ground.\n\nJason Kidd looked sharp in his return to the national team, setting up James for three dunks in the first half. The Nets point guard didn’t attempt a shot until the final minute, with his layup giving the white a 104-103 lead before Bryant’s winning jumper."
