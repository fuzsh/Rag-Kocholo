        "text": "NBA Comparison: Lamar Odom\n\nStrengths: A small forward who can shoot, pass, and dribble. His dribbling skills are phenomenal for a 6-8 player. A good athlete, Mike showed the ability to shine in crunchtime with his last second drive against Butler when he hit the game winning shot with 3 tenths of a second on the clock. His patience and composure in the situation were amazing for just a sophomore. He has great intangables, good leaping ability, and a very good outside shot. Very cerebral and creative player."
