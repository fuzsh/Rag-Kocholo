        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA pure and clutch shooter with excellent range. Also a well-rounded, instinctive playmaker; takes smart shots and makes savvy plays. Able to start at either guard spot and small forward effectively. Solid as a rebounder too. A good teammate and a veteran leader. Injury-prone, and years of NBA play has taken its toll on his body. Occasionally defers to teammates too much when he could provide a better shot. A solid help defender but not a one-on-one stopper who will post big steals numbers."
