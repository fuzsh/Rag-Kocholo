        "text": "Memphis senior Raynere Thornton slammed home an easy dunk in the first 10 minutes of the Tigers' blowout exhibition win over Christian Brothers last week.\n\nTigers coach Penny Hardaway quickly spun around for a gesture that would have been unthinkable just seven months ago. He leaned over to high-five assistant coach Mike Miller.\n\nThis was another bonding moment in a budding partnership unlike any other in college basketball. Two former NBA stars – who earned a combined $219 million in salary, who both settled in Memphis after their playing careers ended, who both sponsored AAU programs – were working collectively to navigate unfamiliar territory.\n\n\"Look, I know it sounds cliché,\" Miller said. \"But really, it was like it was meant to be.\"\n\nDuring an offseason in which Memphis basketball went from struggling to relevant, Hardaway and Miller became the two most prominent faces associated with the program.\n\nThey met twice in April, after Hardaway was hired, to discuss how they could be part of the Tigers' revival. One is the point guard who became head coach. The other is the sharpshooter who understood his role.\n\nTogether, they might just be exactly what Tigers basketball needs. Fans will get their first chance to see the dynamic when Memphis opens the season at 7 p.m. Tuesday against Tennessee Tech at FedExForum (600-AM, 102.7-FM).\n\n\"I realized that this is his baby,\" Miller said. \"I'm here to assist and help. If I see something, we'll talk about it. But whatever he says, that's what we are going to do.\"\n\nContrasting rookies\n\nHardaway's coaching career is something his former Orlando Magic assistant coach Tom Sterner believes was in the works from his early playing career.\n\nSterner never will forget the moment Hardaway approached him in the Pfister Hotel on a road trip to Milwaukee about 20 years ago.\n\n\"We need to talk,\" Sterner recalls Hardaway telling him.\n\nThey moved away from the \"rock star\" atmosphere in the lobby to Hardaway's room, where the assistant and his point guard cleared the air after an impassioned shootaround that morning. Sterner used film to criticize parts of Hardaway's game, and the young guard needed to explain his frustration.\n\n\"It was mature beyond his years,\" Sterner said. \"Not all players would do that. But it said a lot about him that he was man enough to ask for that interaction and also be willing to listen. He was still young at the time, but you could tell he just had it.\"\n\nBut Sterner could not predict the magnitude of Hardaway's return to Memphis, or that he would be joined by Miller, another one of his former players.\n\nSterner was an Orlando Magic assistant coach for 15 years (1990-2002, 2005-07). He coached Hardaway from 1993-99 and Miller from 2000-02, which included both of the former players' rookie seasons. The only other assistant to coach both Miller and Hardaway in the pros briefly was NBA journeyman Jim Boylan.\n\n\"My perspective is different because I've gotten to know them outside the game of basketball,\" Sterner said. \"I'm someone who spent time with both of these guys every day.\"\n\nAnd what he discovered was their personalities couldn't be more contrary.\n\nHardaway was cerebral. He was quiet. He was intense.\n\nMiller was upbeat, lively and inquisitive.\n\nHardaway brought a serious edge to a team led by lighthearted Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nMiller was the easygoing shooter to complement Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady.\n\nBut both were invested heavily in their Magic team.\n\n\"Penny Hardaway was such a student of the game, it was almost to a fault,\" Sterner said.\n\nIt's a statement that comes with no objection from Hardaway, who admitted that as a rookie he studied so often he sometimes would overthink.\n\n\"That was part of being young,\" Hardaway said. \"Every rookie is going to have their ups and downs. But the one thing I did do: I knew the game, for sure.\"\n\n'Interesting dynamic'\n\nBut those contrasting personalities are what makes this coaching dynamic between Miller and Hardaway so fascinating.\n\nIt takes more than being one of the NBA's great shooters to be trusted in Hardaway's circle. To work alongside Hardaway, it requires someone who can match his knowledge of the game. To get this right on the first try, Hardaway needed the correct fit.\n\nAnd he sees all of that in Miller, despite the fact that he \"didn't know what to expect\" when he hired the assistant in April. Hardaway and Miller didn't know each other before the NBA, and they were only acquaintances when the assistant joined the Tigers.\n\n\"It's certainly going to be an interesting dynamic to see how they choose to approach different things as a unit,\" Sterner said.\n\nHardaway, at AAC basketball media day last month, called Miller \"brilliant.\" He also noted that his assistant's days as a great perimeter shooter serves him well while coaching younger talent and complement what he was able to do in the NBA as a point guard.\n\nIt's metaphoric the way their temperaments play off each other, the same way a knockdown shooter pairs with an elite distributor.\n\n\"Mike had a unique enthusiasm about him as a player,\" Sterner said. \"... Penny was more cerebral. He's more reserved and introverted. He fits as the head coach, the guy you can't necessarily get a great read on (as) a player. You have one that's more of an extrovert and one that's an introvert, so together, I think they are going to be a great combination.\"\n\nIt's a dynamic that shapes the Tigers' focus on the recruiting trail.\n\nAs Memphis attempts to lure some of the top players in the country, parents of recruits like the father of top-five 2020 prospect R.J. Hampton claim Miller uses his energetic personality to connect with the players, while Hardaway spends more time communicating with parents.\n\nIt's an area the duo figured they could dominate given their past connections in AAU basketball and their experience in the NBA.\n\nPerhaps outside of personality, the two coaches had so much in common dating to their separate days in Orlando that Miller knew at the very least he and Hardaway shared the same coaching and recruiting philosophies.\n\nCoaching patience\n\nListen to the Memphis bench as an opponent crosses half court, and both Miller and Hardaway will be shouting toward their defense to pressure the ball.\n\n\"It wouldn't surprise me that Mike is one of the more vocal coaches, but it would surprise me if he's yelling about defense,\" Sterner said jokingly.\n\nMiller laughed when he heard Sterner's comment, and said he finds it funny because at Memphis he does more directing on the defensive end than on offense. It's a sign of how much he's grown since his days as a 20-year-old sharpshooter in Orlando.\n\nWhen looking back, both Hardaway and Miller feel like completely different people. Now they're more worried about parenting than doing the necessary conditioning to play every day.\n\n\"Everything at first was full speed,\" Hardaway said reminiscing on his days with Sterner. \"I've learned a lot of patience since then. As you get older, you're supposed to learn how to relax and how to get things across much easier.\"\n\n\"Having kids will do that on its own,\" Miller added.\n\nPatience is the reason Sterner listened to Hardaway when he approached him in the Pfister Hotel lobby about 20 years ago. He knew it was important to listen to his players' perspective.\n\n\"I didn't agree with everything he said when I walked out,\" Sterner said. \"But he was better off once he got his frustration off his chest and I told him, 'Penny, I hear you.'\"\n\nThat's a lesson impossible for Hardaway to miss after spending 15 seasons in the NBA.\n\n\"I hope these players can appreciate everything that we are doing for them,\" Hardaway said.\n\nMemphis basketball: Five observations from coach Penny Hardaway's exhibition games"
