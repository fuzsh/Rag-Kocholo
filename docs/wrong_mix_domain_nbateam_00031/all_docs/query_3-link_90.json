        "text": "Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nThe Miami Heat finalized yet another free-agent signing today, though this one will fly under the radar in comparison to one of the team's last ones.\n\nLast week, as we all know, the Heat struck deals with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.\n\nAnd even more recently, the Heat re-signed Udonis Haslem and added James' former teammate, Zydrunas Ilgauskas.\n\nAll of these moves were done in order to build a decent team around the three superstars, rather than having a bunch of average guys surrounding the trio.\n\nAnd today the Heat added another free agent in guard Mike Miller. Miller joins the team from the Washington Wizards.\n\nFor Miller, he escapes one Southeast Division team for another. But the difference is much larger than that.\n\nLast season, Miller was traded to the Washington Wizards following stops in Orlando, Memphis, and Minnesota.\n\nKnown as a reliable shooter with a nice three-point shot, Miller was expected to team up with Gilbert Arenas and Co. last season and jump-start the Wizards back into playoff contention following their dismal 2008-09 season.\n\nAt least that is what everyone thought.\n\nWhat happened, though, was an entirely different story.\n\nArenas ended up in major legal trouble after his whole gun incident, and the Wiz ended up trading Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison.\n\nAnd just like that, a team that was expected to contend in the East was blown to shreds and headed for the bottom of the conference.\n\nOf course, the Wizards then landed No. 1 draft pick John Wall. But the Wiz are still in rebuilding mode and don't really have a need for Miller with Wall, Arenas returning, and Kirk Hinrich arriving to Washington via trade.\n\nSo Miller navigated the free-agent market.\n\nAnd surprise! He hit the jackpot with the Heat. He now joins a team favored to win it all next season.\n\nHe should fit in nicely and be a solid role player."
