        "text": "Mike Miller\n\nDrafted by: Orlando, Round: 1, Pick: 5\n\nCollege: Florida\n\nHeight: 6-8\n\nWeight: 218 lbs.\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nBirthDate: Feb. 19, 1980\n\nBirthplace: Mitchell, SD\n\nHighlights\n\nExpert Analysis \"While not overly quick, Miller is certainly not slow of foot. He moves well, and is decisive in his movements. That decisiveness sometimes led Miller to commit unnecessary turnovers, but most were a result of trying to do too much. Miller needs to get stronger, and must improve his intermediate-range game and his decision-making. As a defender, Miller will be able to compete favorably, and has been compared to Miami's Dan Majerle (although Miller is taller than Thunder Dan).\" -- ESPN's Jay Bilas\n\nEarly-entry candidate for the 2000 NBA Draft.
