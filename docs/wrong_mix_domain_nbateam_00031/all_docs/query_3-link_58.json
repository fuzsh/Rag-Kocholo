        "text": "Miller coached seven seasons, going 12-17 this year\n\n2/27/2012 1:24:00 PM\n\nCHARLESTON, Ill. - Eastern Illinois University athletic director Barbara Burke has announced that Panthers men's basketball head coach Mike Miller's contract ending on April 30 will not be renewed.\n\nThe Panthers concluded the regular season on Saturday night at Eastern Kentucky as they were eliminated from the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament race on the final day of the season. EIU was 12-17 this season.\n\n\"I want to take this opportunity to thank Mike Miller for his service to Eastern Illinois University and in particular to our men's basketball program,\" Burke said. “He is a quality individual who has worked extremely hard and dedicated many hours to our student-athletes and the Panther basketball program.\"\n\nMiller led the program to the OVC Tournament in 2009 and advanced to the semifinals of the OVC Tournament in 2010 winning 19 games and posting the school's first winning season since the 2000-01 season. In 2010 EIU won eight straight games to end the season setting a school record for consecutive wins in the program's Division I era. The 19 wins are the second highest win total for EIU since joining the OVC. The Panthers were not able to maintain that success the last two years failing to make the OVC Tournament both seasons.\n\n“I appreciate the opportunity I was given to lead the program at Eastern Illinois and the support and friendships we have developed in the community,” said Miller. “I want to thank the members of my staff especially associate head coach Chad Altadonna who has worked tirelessly the last seven years to improve this program. I want to thank all the players who have played for us and represented the program.”\n\nA national search for Miller's replacement will begin immediately. The three current assistant coaches will be retained until a new coach has been hired and makes decisions on the new coaching staff."
