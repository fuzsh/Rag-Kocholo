        "text": "NBA agent and former NBAer Mike Miller was “resistant to the idea at first” when LIFT Sports Management co-founder Donnie McGrath asked him if he wanted a role with the firm, according to Mike Vorkunov of THE ATHLETIC. Now, 2 1/2 years later, LIFT Sports has “been crafted in his vision.” The agency “made a splash in June” when client F Paolo Banchero went No. 1 to the Magic. LIFT, which “started as a five-person operation, has nearly tripled” since it began in mid-2020. McGrath said that the agency “represents eight NBA players and has roughly 25 clients, including pro athletes and college ones signed to name, image and likeness deals.” While Miller is the President and “face of the company,” McGrath now “handles its business affairs and is its CEO.” The company has also brought in former T'Wolves Exec Noah Croom as an SVP along with longtime NBA agent Dan Frank who was “front and center at LIFT’s inception as its first certified agent.” LIFT also brought in former Knicks Dir of Scouting Kristian Petesic as its Dir of Basketball Operations. Vorkunov writes it has been a “quick ascent for a young agency, especially in an industry known to be notoriously competitive.” But LIFT feels “it can differentiate itself even in that saturated market, with Miller at its core as an ex-NBA player who believes he can guide current players through the wisdom he gained during his 17 seasons in the league.\" McGrath said he \"considered approaching more established agents,\" but Miller was \"a no-brainer.\" The agency \"gets its name from one of Miller’s favorite phrases;\" they are the \"Let It Fly Team.\" Miller is now \"one of three NBPA-certified agents at the company, and just one of seven former players to be certified by the union after he passed the agent certification exam in 2021\" (THE ATHLETIC, 1/26)."
