He methodically led the program to national prominence, as the 1996 season was the program’s first 20-win campaign — producing an overall record of 20-8 — and first NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nA coach set on teaching principles both on and off the court, Miller’s teams have always achieved in the classroom, evidenced by repeated appearances at the top of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll.\n\nMiller's integrity and dedication to women's basketball has given him the opportunity to serve as a member of the Commonwealth Conference Games Committee and as a member of the NCAA Ranking Committee. He currently serves as a WBCA MAC Commonwealth Captain and as a selection committee member for the prestigious WBCA Jostens Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nMike and his wife of 40 years, Norma, live in Mechanicsburg, Pa. They have two children, Taylor Keener '14, and son Michael (Gordon College '12). Miller is also a grandfather of four grandchildren, Theo, Ellie, Lexi, and Isaac.\n\nCOACHING BY SEASON\n\nMESSIAH WOMEN'S BASKETBALL\n\nSeason Overall Record Conference Record Conference Finish NCAA Appearance 1986-87 9-12 4-6 --- 1987-88 12-11 4-6 --- 1988-89 10-13 3-7 --- 1989-90 14-10 2-8 --- 1990-91 14-10 3-7 --- 1991-92 13-11 2-8 --- 1992-93 9-15 3-7 --- 1993-94 11-13 7-7 --- 1994-95 15-8 10-4 Quarterfinal --- 1995-96 20-8 10-4 Runner-Up Second Round 1996-97 13-11 6-8 --- --- 1997-98 17-8 10-4 Semifinal --- 1998-99 18-7 9-5 Semifinal --- 1999-00 22-6 13-1 Semifinal Second Round 2000-01 27-5 14-0 Runner-Up National Runner-Up 2001-02 23-4 12-2 Champion Second Round 2002-03 25-4 14-0 Champion Elite Eight 2003-04 23-4 14-0 Runner-Up Second Round 2004-05 25-4 12-2 Champion Sweet Sixteen 2005-06 26-3 13-1 Champion Second Round 2006-07 26-3 13-1 Champion Second Round 2007-08 30-3 10-0 Champion National Runner-Up 2008-09 23-5 11-1 Semifinal Second Round 2009-10 24-5 11-3 Champion Second Round 2010-11 19-8 12-2 Runner-Up First Round 2011-12 22-6 12-2 Semifinal Second Round 2012-13 25-5 16-2 Runner-Up Sweet Sixteen 2013-14 21-8 14-4 Champion Second Round 2014-15 13-13 9-7 Semifinal --- 2015-16 19-8 12-4 Runner-Up --- 2016-17 25-3 14-2 Champion First Round 2017-18 27-3 15-1 Champion Sweet Sixteen 2018-19 28-2 16-0 Champion Sweet Sixteen 2019-20 25-4 15-1 Champion Sweet Sixteen (halted for COVID) 2020-21 11-0 10-0 Champion -- No Tournament -- 2021-22 23-4 14-2 Champion First Round 2022-23 26-3 16-0 Champion Second Round 2023-24 23-6 13-1 Runner-Up Second Round Seasons: 38 759-255 398-120 15 Championships 2 National Runner-Ups .746 winning % .768 winning %\n\nLast updated: 07/23/24\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
