        "text": "Barrrett has had a strong stretch of games recently, the latest coming in Sunday’s win over the Heat. The No. 3 pick had 23 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals. He hit 7 of 10 shot attempts and eight of 10 from the free-throw line. “He was so balanced. He scored the ball in different ways,” Miller said. “His command, his confidence level, just everything. He made the right plays consistently. They tried to trap him, he kept finding the open guy that led to the next pass. He was patient enough to know I beat the trap here, let him make the next pass. He made some really good basketball plays.”\n\nIf Porzingis had stuck with the Knicks, Mike Miller would be his fifth coach in five seasons. He got along well with Fizdale, but never got a chance to play for him. “Honestly, it is what it is,” Porzingis told the Daily News. “For him — I liked him as a coach and as a person for the time I was around. They had to sacrifice somebody. I’m almost glad that. …” Porzingis paused and smiled. Stinging words for the organization were at the tip of his tongue, but the 24-year-old again fell on the side of diplomacy. “It is what it is and they didn’t have the start that they wanted,” he continued. “It sucks that those kind of things happen, but at the end it’s a business and they had to make a move.”"
