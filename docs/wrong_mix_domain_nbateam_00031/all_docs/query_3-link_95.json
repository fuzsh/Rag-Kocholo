        "text": "Like so many other members of the 2021 class, Mason Miller expected these summer months to play out differently.\n\nAAU tournaments, important recruiting decisions, visit schedules — all parts of the recruiting process either off the table or firmly in limbo amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Miller is staying patient through it all.\n\n“Right now, I’m just waiting it out, seeing what happens,” Miller told IndyStar.\n\nBest IU coverage anywhere:\n\nIU basketball recruiting tales: A.J. Guyton bet on himself, wasn't afraid of Bob Knight\n\nWhat it cost for IU football to play in the Gator Bowl\n\nIU football: Resolution of canceled games could become murky\n\nA four-star forward with a soft shooting touch and a father who spent more than a decade in the NBA, Miller is hearing most often from IU, Ohio State and Creighton at the moment. He talks regularly with Indiana associate head coach Tom Ostrom and Ohio State assistant coach Jake Diebler.\n\n“I’ve been texting a lot of coaches,” Miller said. “Ohio State’s been texting me a lot. Indiana too. I have a pretty good relationship with coach Ostrom.”\n\nMiller has even been able to take virtual visits like the one IU set up, which included a bird’s-eye view of the city of Bloomington, a tour of facilities and a look at the gameday atmosphere through the lens of a camera.\n\n“It’s actually pretty cool,” Miller said.\n\nThat sort of communication has comprised the bulk of recruiting movement for Miller in recent months, with everything slowed down by the pandemic.\n\nA 6-9 forward ranked No. 51 in 2021 by 247Sports, Miller can stretch the floor with his shooting ability in addition to providing a big body in the frontcourt.\n\nHis father, Mike, recently left his role as an assistant coach at Memphis, another school on Miller’s offer list. Miller has been putting work in during the break with his father, and teammates at Houston High School in Germantown, Tenn.\n\n“I’ve been doing a lot of individual workouts with my dad, a lot of shooting workouts with him,” Mason Miller said, “and I’ve done a few workouts with my school team, six people at a time.”\n\nFor the moment, pandemic-related NCAA rules still don’t allow in-person contact, meaning prospects cannot take visits. Miller plans to schedule his officials once he’s able.\n\nIn the meantime, he’s not rushing anything, with no hard-and-fast timetable set for a decision. Like so many of his classmates, Miller is taking the current situation in stride.\n\n“(A decision date is) really nothing I’m worrying about yet,” he said.\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman."
