        "text": "Were the 1999 Oscars the last compelling best-original-song Race?\n\nThis year’s best-original-song category at the Oscars is . . . fine. Respectable. An aggressively decent set of songs, and these days, that's about the best we can hope for in that category.\n\nThere are a few reasons for these lowered expectations. Nobody's really writing hit pop songs for movies anymore, and with a general dearth of songs people truly care about, the category has become a dreadful bore. Looking back, the last hurrah for a truly compelling best song lineup was 1999, and as last hurrahs go, this one was pretty memorable. Let's set the stage with the nominees:\n\n“Save Me,” from Magnolia: The designated cool entry on this list, harnessing the cred of singer/songwriter Aimee Mann, who provided the bulk of the songs on the film's soundtrack album.\n\n“Music of My Heart,” from Music of the Heart: A Diane Warren-penned ballad (this was her fifth career nomination at this point; she's still never won) performed by Gloria Estefan and ’N Sync.\n\n“Blame Canada,” from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut: A surprise nominee from the TV-series adaptation that turned out to be a crackerjack screen musical, with music and lyrics co-written by Broadway vet Marc Shaiman.\n\n\"You'll Be in My Heart,” from Tarzan: With music and lyrics by Phil Collins, this was the year's designated Disney nominee, from a movie that, while it's never been remembered particularly fondly as far as Disney movies go, still finished sixth at the box office for all of 1999.\n\n“When She Loved Me,” from Toy Story 2: The second of what would end up being three nominations for Randy Newman from the Toy Story series, this one sung in the movie (and at the Oscars) by Sarah McLachlan.\n\nBy 1999, the best song category was already in decline. It had been a steep fall from the glory days of the 1980s, when the best song lineups would regularly feature multiple number-one singles. In 1984, all five nominees hit the top of the charts at one point or another (the lineup included “Footloose,” the theme from Ghostbusters, and winner “I Just Called to Say I Love You.”) As the '90s hit, the category shifted into an era of Disney dominance, with animated films taking 6 out of 10 awards and 17 of 50 nominations. Then came the 2000s and the wasteland era. Sure, there was always a “Lose Yourself” or a \"Let It Go\" to prop up the Billboard stats. Sure, there were enough “Skyfall”s and “Falling Slowly”s to placate the critics. But if you can recite more than five words from songs like “Into the West” or “I Need to Wake Up,” or either of Randy Newman's winning songs from Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 3, Vanity Fair will mail you one thousand dollars. (No they won't.)\n\nThe 1999 lineup doesn't represent the best in the category's history, just the last time that there was enough interest and intrigue in the songs involved for it to be memorable. And when it was all said and done, there was plenty of intrigue.\n\nThe previous year’s winner was “When You Believe” from The Prince of Egypt, yet another animated musical, though this one from DreamWorks. Still, Disney was looking to return to the top with Tarzan, technically not a musical, but with a soundtrack composed by Phil Collins, since going the Brit crooner route worked out so well for Elton John and The Lion King. Collins’ place in the 1999 competition remains its weakest link, and the easiest target for charges that the category does not achieve true greatness. Well, that and another nominee.\n\nThis is especially unfortunate when looking at the potential nominees that didn’t make the cut in 1999:\n\n“Beautiful Stranger”: Madonna's underrated little dance gem from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was nominated for a Golden Globe but, true to form, Madonna doesn't get Oscar nominations unless she's singing songs written by Broadway legends.\n\n“The World Is Not Enough”: If you feel so inclined, you can see Adele’s win for “Skyfall” in this category two years ago as reconciliation for inexplicably passing over Garbage's title song for Pierce Brosnan's third Bond film. Shirley Manson’s voice was made to sing songs like this. Truthfully, I'd put it up with “Goldfinger” and the best Bond themes.\n\n“Wild Wild West”: This is trash, sure, but it’s still more iconic and flat-out fun than anything in Tarzan. Sisqo on the hook is actually kind of fantastic.\n\n“New”: Nominating No Doubt's song from Go would have solved a few problems for the Academy. They’d have upped the cool quotient on their Best Song category rather significantly. And they wouldn't have gone down in history as not having recognized the greatness of Go in any category.\n\n“The Great Beyond”: R.E.M. wrote a new song for the Andy Kaufman bio-pic Man on the Moon, a movie that got its title from an R.E.M. song written about Andy Kaufman. How did this slam-dunk narrative (plus a pretty great song) miss?\n\nHad even one of these above songs been nominated, we'd be talking best lineup of all time. None of the above options (or at least not as many of them) would have even been necessary if Aimee Mann hadn’t given her superior song “Wise Up” to the Jerry Maguire soundtrack three years earlier. There, it went largely unnoticed. Paul Thomas Anderson, however, used it as the centerpiece of his sprawling, multi-character film Magnolia, and had it been eligible, the optimist in me thinks it could have easily won, due to its prominence within the film alone. Alas, it wasn’t. As consolation prizes go, for Aimee Mann, getting a best song nomination for one of the songs she did write expressly for the film, \"Save Me,\" is still pretty great. As it stands, it's probably one of the highest quality songs to have been nominated in the last 25 years.\n\nThe final two nominees came from animated movies, though not in the way best song nominees usually arrived back then. Toy Story 2, like Tarzan, and more importantly like the decade-plus of Pixar movies that would follow, was not a musical. But Sarah McLachlan’s performance of \"When She Loved Me\" was deployed to heartstring-destroying effect mid-movie, telling the micro-story of a doll and the girl who outgrew her.\n\nAll of this would simply add up to the story of any old best-song category were it not for the fifth nominee: “Blame Canada” from South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. By the time award nominations were being handed out, skeptics were still warming to the idea that, rather than simply a cash-in on a popular TV show, the South Park movie had stealthily presented itself as a clockwork-structured work of movie-musical genius. And while it was certainly too much to expect Academy voters to have ushered in gleefully vulgar songs like “Uncle Fucka,” “Blame Canada” was comparatively tame. Its inclusion was one of the more pleasant surprises of nomination morning.\n\nAt the Oscars, Williams performed with a cast of dozens, including a kick-line of dancers dressed as Mounties. Equally festive were Parker and Stone, who showed up to their big night dressed to make a statement, in replicas of dresses famously worn by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez at award shows. (Parker and Stone have also recently claimed to have been tripping on acid that night, which must’ve made E!'s red-carpet coverage seem even more terrifying.)\n\nThat Collins would ultimately triumph for “You'll Be in My Heart” from Tarzan couldn’t have come as a huge surprise. He did win the Golden Globe, after all. But Parker has said on multiple occasions that while he wasn’t expecting to win, he wasn't prepared to lose to something so square as a Phil Collins song. They got their revenge, though, by making Collins and his Oscar the butt of jokes in two separate episodes of South Park the subsequent season. When has any Oscar race been this deeply felt since then?\n\nA year later, Björk would get a miraculous and awesome nomination for “I've Seen It All” from Dancer in the Dark, Bob Dylan would win for a decent but forgettable song from Wonder Boys, and they’d be joined in the category by three songs you've never heard in your entire life. The 2000s had begun, and for every “It’s Hard out Here for a Pimp,” there were six “Scarlet Tide”s. The closest the category would ever come to a controversy was last year’s disqualified nomination for Alone Yet Not Alone, a movie that literally no one saw. Even Eminem just didn't show up for his “Lose Yourself” win. Not so much as a Sacheen Littlefeather or anything.\n\nDid we even know how good we had it in 1999? Of course we didn't. But in the 15 years since, the best song category has fallen into sad disrepair. This year's lineup is encouraging in its own modest way, with the Lonely Island facing off against John Legend and, yes, Diane Warren. But we used to have Aimee Mann. We used to have Kyle’s mom."
