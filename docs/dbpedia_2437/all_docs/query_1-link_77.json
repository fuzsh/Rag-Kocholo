His 22-0 record includes an 12-0 mark in BIG EAST play, along with a 11-0 mark at the Orange Bowl and a 11-0 record on the road. Coker’s start at Miami is the best of any first-time head coach in the “modern era” of college football (post-1950) for wins without a tie or loss. Oklahoma’s Barry Switzer started out 21-0-1 in 1973-74, but suffered a tie in his second game as head coach. Coker’s unbeaten/untied start is the best by a first-time Division I-A head coach since Walter Camp of Yale led the Bulldogs to 28 consecutive victories before a loss in the 1888-89 seasons.\n\nCoker led Miami to an undefeated season in his first year as a collegiate head coach with the 2001 Hurricanes. Coker was named Miami’s 19th head football coach on February 3, 2001. Coker was named National Coach of the Year for 2001 by the American Football Coaches Association (an honor shared with Maryland’s Ralph Friedgen) and was recipient of the 2001 Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. The 2002 season marks Coker’s eighth overall at Miami, after serving as the Hurricanes’ offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 1995-2000. Prior to 1995, Coker was an assistant coach at Ohio State (1993-94), Oklahoma (1990-92), Oklahoma State (1983-89) and Tulsa (1979-82).\n\nMIAMI-SYRACUSE SERIES HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMiami and Syracuse have met 20 times since 1960 with the Hurricanes holding the 13-7 series lead. The record includes an 8-2 mark in BIG EAST play since in 1992.Miami is riding a three-game win streak in the series and has won those games by a combined score of 130-13 (43.4 – 4.3), a 39.1-point margin of victory. Additionally, the Hurricanes have won the last two meetings with the Orangemen by an 85-0 margin, 26-0 at the Carrier Dome in 2000 and 59-0 at the Orange Bowl in 2001. The two SU victories in the BIG EAST series occurred in 1997 (33-13 in Miami) and 1998 (66-13 at Syracuse).The overall series record is broken down into a 6-2 all-time mark on the road at Syracuse (4-1 at the Carrier Dome, 2-1 at Archibald Stadium) and a 7-3 record at the Orange Bowl. Additionally, Syracuse holds a 2-0 advantage in neutral site games with a 15-14 win in the 1961 Liberty Bowl and a 25-15 victory at Buffalo’s Rich Stadium in 1979.Miami and Syracuse was the first BIG EAST rivalry. Prior to round-robin conference play that began in 1993, Miami and Syracuse finished 1-2 in each of the 1991 and 1992 BIG EAST standings, respectively. The Hurricanes were crowned conference champion in both of those seasons by being the higher ranked team in the final regular season USA Today/CNN Top 25 Coaches’ Poll. Additionally, Miami played for the national championship in 1991 and 1992, winning the 1991 title.In 1995, Miami was not eligible for the conference title, but defeated Syracuse, 34-25, in the Orange Bowl to deny the Orangemen at least a share of the title with Virginia Tech. SU finished the league schedule at 5-2 to the Hokies 6-1 record.In 1996, Miami, Syracuse and Virginia Tech, shared the league title with 6-1 records apiece. Then-16th ranked Orangemen had a shot to win the championship out-right, but were upset by the 23rd-ranked Hurricanes, 38-31, at the Carrier Dome in the regular season finale.The 1998 season saw Syracuse capture the league championship with a 66-13 win over Miami at the Carrier Dome, yet finish behind the Hurricanes in the final seasons polls. UM’s worse conference defeat was in large due to a stellar performance from senior Donovan McNabb in his final regular season game and placed the Hurricanes in a tie for second. UM rebounded to defeat UCLA, 49-45, at the Orange Bowl the routed N.C. State, 46-23, in the Micron PC Bowl. Florida downed Syracuse, 31-10, in the Orange Bowl Classic.

The current 32-game win streak, including bowl games, continues Miami’s school record and surpassed the 29-game streak set from 1990-92. The streak also is the 7th longest win streak in college football history.\n\nIn the regular season, UM has won 30 consecutive regular season games dating back to a 47-10 victory at West Virginia on Sept. 23, 2000. The longest win streak in the regular season for Miami is 36 games, accomplished from a 48-20 win at Rice on Sept. 14, 1985, to a 31-30 loss at Notre Dame on Oct. 15, 1988.\n\nORANGE BOWL WIN STREAK AT A NATIONAL-BEST 21 GAMES\n\nMiami’s 28-21 win over Pittsburgh extended the Hurricanes’ Orange Bowl win streak to 20 games, dating back to a 28-20 win over West Virginia on Oct. 30, 1999.\n\nThe 21-game home win streak is currently the longest in the nation following Nebraska’s recent home loss to Texas on Nov. 2.

In non-conference games during the streak, Miami has outscored eight opponents 372-141 (46.5-17.6 per game – 28.9 UM margin of victory). Against the BIG EAST, Miami has outscored the league 580-97 (44.6-7.5 per game – 37.1 UM margin of victory) in 13 home contests. Against the six ranked teams defeated at the Orange Bowl during the streak, Miami outscored the opposition 248-100 (41.3-16.7 per game – 24.6 UM margin of victory).\n\nDuring the streak Miami’s lowest point total is 27 points in a 27-24 thrilling win over No. 1 Florida State on Oct. 7, 2000.

FAMU totaled 17 points in the 2002 season opener at the Orange Bowl, marking the first time in a nine-game home span the opponent scored more than seven points.Prio to Pittsburgh’s first quarter touchdown on Nov. 21, the last touchdown recorded by a BIG EAST opponent at the Orange Bowl was in the first quarter vs. Boston College on Nov. 25, 2000 – 23 straight quarters over six league games.Over the last 13 home games since defeating Pittsburgh, 35-7, on Nov. 11, 2000, the Hurricanes have outscored home opponents 598-115 (46.0-8.8 per game – 37.2 UM margin of victory).Including the home loss to Penn State in 1999, Miami has won 25 of 26 home contests since a 26-14 loss to FSU on Oct. 10, 1998.\n\nCURRENT ROAD WIN STREAK AT 16 GAMES\n\nMiami has won a national-best 16 straight games away from the Orange Bowl, including the 2002 Rose Bowl and 2001 Sugar Bowl, since defeating West Virginia in Morgantown, 47-10, on Sept. 23, 2000.\n\nRegular season only, Miami has a current 14-game road win streak since that win over the Mountaineers.

The Hurricanes’ road record in the 19 seasons beginning with 1983 is the best among all NCAA Division 1A football institutions. Miami has a record of 83-19-0 (.814) in road games at the opponent’s home.
