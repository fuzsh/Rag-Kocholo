        "text": "28-4-17\n\nThe Gustav Sonata by UEA alumna Rose Tremain has been shortlisted for both the Royal Society of Literature’s Ondaatje Prize and the Independent Bookshop Week Book Award (adult category). The novel was also recently nominated for the 2017 Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction. Rose (pictured) graduated from UEA with a BA in English in 1967 and later returned to the university to teach on the Creative Writing MA and, more recently, to become the University’s first female Chancellor. Among her many other acclaimed novels are Music and Silence (1999), which won the Whitbread Novel Award, and The Road Home, which won the 2008 Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction. She was made a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 2007. The winner of the Ondaatje Prize, which is worth £10,000, will be announced on 8th May. The winner of the IBW Book Award, which is coordinated by The Booksellers Association will be announced on 23rd June."
