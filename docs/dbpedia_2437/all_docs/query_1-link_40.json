        "text": "Who wrote it?\n\nMaggie O'Farrell (1972- ; active 2000- ), born in Coleraine in County Derry/Londonderry in Northern Ireland, but grew up in Wales and Scotland. She studied English Literature at the University of Cambridge, before working as a journalist, including a stint as deputy literary editor of The Independent. She lives in Edinburgh with her husband, the English novelist William Sutcliffe, with whom she has three children.\n\nHer nine novels to date have been widely acclaimed and awarded, from her first novel After You'd Gone (2000) which took the Betty Trask Award for young debut novelists, through the Costa-winning The Hand That First Held Mine (2010), Instructions for a Heatwave (2014), which was shortlisted for the Costa, and Hamnet which won the National Book Critics Circle award in addition to the Women's Prize. She has also written two children's books, published a memoir (I Am, I Am, I Am) in 2017, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2021. Her latest novel, The Marriage Portrait, was shortlisted for the 2023 Women’s Prize.\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nHamnet is a creative imagining of the story of the death of Shakespeare’s only son. Despite its title, it focuses predominantly on the bard’s wife, here called Agnes (pronounced Ann-yis, and as named in her father’s will) though typically better known as Anne Hathaway. It’s a non-linear narrative with its substantial first section moving back and forth in time between the events leading up to Hamnet’s death from the bubonic plague, and the early days of William and Agnes’ relationship, covering the birth of their three children, first Susanna, whose conception leads to their marriage, and later the twins Judith and Hamnet.\n\nThe novel begins with Judith the one seemingly doomed to succumb to the plague; the ‘weaker’ twin, she is laid low with a heavy fever and tell-tale buboes. We find Hamnet searching the streets of Stratford for any of his relatives who can help, but all are absent - William is off in London, his career in the theatre already blossoming; the nature-attuned Agnes off tending her bees; and various other relatives nowhere to be found. Although we learn relatively little about Hamnet, he is presented as intelligent and caring, the model child looking to help his sick sister.\n\nJumping to the past, we are introduced to a young unnamed ‘Latin tutor’ working at the house of the Hathaways. Evidently bored with his work, the young Shakespeare first spies Agnes emerging from the forest bearing her adopted pet kestrel, and seems to instantly fall for her. Some rather racy encounters involving the literal and metaphorical upsetting of apple carts occur, and lead to the young William asking Agnes’ stepmother, the harsh and contrary Joan, for her hand in marriage, which she laughs off.\n\nThe first two-thirds of the book jumps back and forth between these two scenarios, largely focusing on the domestic situation of Agnes and her children, living at close quarters with Shakespeare’s parents - the fearsome and feckless John and the motherly but traditional and practical Mary. Agnes is an otherly presence in the Shakespeare household, regarded with suspicion by most in the house (and town) as something of a witchy oddball, but the families integrate and we see them working together through the toil and hardship of sixteenth century domestic life. Shakespeare himself is more of an absence - purposefully never referred to by name, he is barely there in the ‘present day’ sections and in the early parts (save when upsetting apples with Agnes) his mind is clearly wanting to be elsewhere.\n\nThe last third of the book is dominated by the devastating impact of Hamnet’s death, primarily on Agnes, who blames herself for her lack of attention to her son and descends into a deep depression, losing interest in her previous focus on natural remedies, leaving Susanna to become the ‘mother’ of the house and restlessly searching for signs of connection from her dead child. Unthinkably to Agnes, William almost immediately returns to London, convinced that if he stays he will be stuck in Stratford and never leave. In his long absence through Agnes’ grief, a strange relationship develops between the two, in which Agnes’ hatred for him is punctuated by signs of their love when he makes brief visits back to Stratford - including to buy her the largest house in town, the fruits of his burgeoning success.\n\nThe final pages, masterfully handled, bring the pair back together in suitably dramatic fashion. Upon learning that William has, without telling Agnes or his daughters, named his latest play after their lost son (we learn in the book’s introduction that ‘Hamnet’ and ‘Hamlet’ were ‘entirely interchangeable’ names at the time,) Agnes determines to go to London and try to understand what her husband is up to. Initially baffled to the point of disgust by the play and its perceived disconnection to her son, she is brought round by the story in which Shakespeare plays the ghost of Hamlet’s father, an artistic attempt to reverse the roles and bring his child back to life on stage, a father wishing he could have given his own life in place of his son’s.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nThis is the second book by Maggie O’Farrell that I’ve read, and like the more recent The Marriage Portrait it is utterly beautifully written. It’s somehow rich while maintaining absolute clarity throughout, and poetic without being remotely difficult. A joy to read.\n\nLike The Marriage Portrait, Hamnet uses shifting timelines to really good effect. I particularly liked the way that in the final section, following the death of the title character, the time-shifting stopped - moving us from a seeming never-ending interplay between past and present into a more relentless, doom-laden evocation of the linear march of time.\n\nIt’s a book that sometimes catches you off guard, in a really good way. Much of the long first section is a gorgeously immersive but not entirely unpredictable evocation of the time and place and people that captivates without surprising. But this only makes its diversions the more impactful. The section detailing the bizarre oddities of fate that led the virus on its journey to the Shakespeare household comes out of nowhere and is a dazzling tour de force when it arrives, to take only the most spectacular example.\n\nThe final section of the book is exceptional from start to finish. It begins with one of the most starkly-rendered and devastating renditions of grief that I have ever read (or encountered in any art form) - the interplay between Agnes and the left-behind twin (‘Is there a word for that?’ - wah!) Judith is especially heartbreaking.\n\nAgnes and her brother Bartholomew’s journey to the ‘hellscape’ of London is also hugely memorable. Previously, like Shakespeare himself, the capital has been a mysterious absence in the book, with Agnes left to speculate on what it might be like. Here though, Shakespeare’s London with all its sounds, smells and severed heads on sticks is briefly brought to life with an exhilarating jolt.\n\nThe book’s conclusion (like much, in fact, about this book) could have been cheesy, mawkish, overly predictable, but in fact is incredibly well-handled. This, and the whole of part II of the book, made me understand why this book in particular is held in such high esteem, and why some (though I personally really enjoyed it) may have been relatively disappointed by contrast with The Marriage Portrait.\n\nWhat I didn’t like\n\nAs I’ve said above, I think this is required in order for the latter surprises and developments to have impact, but I didn’t immediately understand the great love for this book. It spends quite a long time being enchanting rather than invigorating as a read, so could potentially lose some readers in its earlier stages. This is no major criticism though - it more than won me over with its incredible final section.\n\nFood & drink pairings"
