Her paternal great-grandfather is William Thomson, who was Archbishop of York from 1862 to 1890.\n\nShe was educated at Francis Holland School, Crofton Grange School, the Sorbonne (1961–1962) and the University of East Anglia (BA, English Literature).

The marriage lasted about five years. Her second marriage, to theatre director Jonathan Dudley, in 1982, lasted about nine years; and she has been with Richard Holmes since 1992. She lives in Thorpe St Andrew near Norwich in Norfolk.\n\nWriting\n\nHer influences include William Golding, author of Lord of the Flies, and Gabriel García Márquez's 1967 novel 100 Years of Solitude and the magical realism style.\n\nShe is a historical novelist who approaches her subjects \"from unexpected angles, concentrating her attention on unglamorous outsiders.\"\n\nIn 2009, she donated the short story The Jester of Astapovo to Oxfam's \"Ox-Tales\" project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the \"Earth\" collection.\n\nShe became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1983.
