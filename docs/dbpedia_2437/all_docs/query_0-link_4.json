        "text": "On Wednesday evening, my new novel, Merivel: A Man of His Time failed to win the handsome Wellcome Trust book prize, open to both fiction and non-fiction, and founded to celebrate \"medicine in literature\". Merivel tells the story of a roguish 17th-century doctor's attempts to anatomise his own life.\n\nThe prize went to Thomas Wright for his historical biography of William Harvey, Circulation.\n\nOver a lifetime in writing, I've had numerous opportunities to perfect the art of not winning. I've been shortlisted for but not won the Man Booker prize, the Whitbread book of the year, the Costa novel prize, the Orange prize (won at the second attempt in 2007) the Frank O'Connor short story award, the Impac award, the Galaxy \"Book of the Year\" award and the Radio 3 short story award. These ubiquitous non-wins meant that, last night, my facial muscles were so well practised in the \"non-winners smile\" that it could be summoned in a nanosecond.\n\nMy mind, too, has become nicely obedient to correct \"non-winning thought\", which is a slightly more difficult and complex thing. I could compare it to a military operation in which defeat appears to loom, but where the wise general decides to retreat, in order to protect the forces that remain. Those remaining forces are the book itself. It's still there, after all. It hasn't even suffered the wounding that can sometimes be inflicted by critics. It has just \"not won\". It has almost won, but not quite. It is evidently vain to see this as a catastrophe.\n\nSome measure of depression, however, almost always creeps in. A \"non-win\" is of course a loss. My hero, Robert Merivel reflects \"how astonishing it is that Man attempts any Thing of Significance … when part of him knows that if he fails, all his former contentment will be lost.\" I think that he, who dreams of presenting learned monographs at the Royal Society, would agree that being shortlisted for a major prize is a Thing of Significance, even if, we, the authors didn't precisely \"attempt it\" – our publishers attempted it, but it was the book that failed. And here arises the further difficulty to be surmounted by correct non-winning thought: the non-winner is inclined to feel guilty at letting the publishers down.\n\nWe feel it because we know how much they care about it, or at least about the enhanced sales that prize-winners trail in their wake. I was slightly amazed, for instance, at last year's Booker dinner, by how choked with dread were the Cape contingent at the idea of a non-win for Julian Barnes for The Sense of an Ending. I suspect that, cool and clever as he is, he would have coped better with this outcome than his publishing team, on whose behalf he might well have felt guilty. (He won, right? So he didn't have to endure this.) But author/publisher guilt is, in my view, strenuously to be fought. Although it is certainly self-imposed, having to suffer it doesn't seem fair or just.\n\nAssume, then, that the non-winner can lay this aside, there is a yet third hurdle to be scrambled over. The most significant hurdle of all is finding the resources to defeat the almost inevitable 48-hour blues that follow the non-win, and the energy to return to the work in hand, unaffected by what's just happened to a different book. Every writer I know feels more or less contented or discontented with day-to-day life according to how his or her writing is going. Many, many things will affect this, but I know that the non-win of a prize can seem to infect the ongoing work with a badness-virus and lay the author low. What's on the page or screen – in which there had been stubborn belief, perhaps even garlanded a bit with excitement – can suddenly appear less than first-rate. Sentences crease and bend. Dialogue sounds wan. Even the ideas which inform the book can buckle at the knees.\n\nThe art of surviving this is simply the art of keeping on. Time and hard work will heal the poor ravaged thing. In the work lies the future. In the future may lie other shortlists and other wins or non-wins. And so the whole darn desperate process begins again …\n\nMy greatest ally in the art of not winning is the late HarperCollins editor and humourist, Patricia Parkin. It was her amused ghost I summoned on Wednesday to keep my smile in place and my mind steady. She was among a group of close friends who attended the Frank O'Connor award non-win with me in 2005. (The prize was deservedly won by the marvellous Chinese writer, Yiyun Li.) My contingent had flown to Cork, Patricia's cancer notwithstanding, put up at a hotel where a water-feature cascaded down the walls of the bar, changed into smart clothes, drunk some Guinness, and climbed unsteadily into a people carrier. By this time, we were all definitely in the mood for winning.\n\nThe event took place in a part of the town hall that seemed to resemble a school gymnasium. Laid out on tables was a buffet, whose principal offerings were plates of potato sandwiches. And when my non-win was announced, Patricia brought me some of these. \"Look! A potato sandwich, Rose!\" she said. \"What greater compensation could you ask for?\" Since then I've always referred to my numerous non-wins as \"potato sandwiches\". In my family, the \"potato sandwich\" has become a code for failing to get what the world of football calls a \"result\", and it is very useful in the disappointment arena because it never fails to make us all smile. But on that distant evening in Cork I also remember Patricia's silently-mouthed fury on my behalf: \"B*****! S***! F***! And B***** again!\" Quite so. And that's the delirious, uncool version of the non-winning response, to which – despite all the rationalisation I've just indulged in – I can so easily give way."
