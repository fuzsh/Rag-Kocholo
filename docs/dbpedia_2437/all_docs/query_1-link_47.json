        "text": "British author Ali Smith has won the 2015 Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction with her sixth novel How to Be Both (Hamish Hamilton).\n\nThe Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction is the UK’s only annual book award for fiction written by a woman celebrating excellence, originality and accessibility in women’s writing from throughout the world.\n\nAt an awards ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, London – hosted by broadcaster, author and DJ, Lauren Laverne – the 2015 Chair of Judges, Shami Chakrabarti, presented the author with the £30,000 prize and the ‘Bessie’, a limited edition bronze figurine. Both are anonymously endowed.\n\nShami Chakrabarti, Chair of Judges, said:“Ancient and modern meet and speak to each other in this tender, brilliant and witty novel of grief, love, sexuality and shape-shifting identity.”\n\nEstablished in 1996 to celebrate and promote international fiction by women throughout the world to the widest range of readers possible, the Prize – now in its twentieth* year and the second of a three year partnership with new headline sponsor, Baileys – is awarded for the best novel of the year written by a woman. Any woman writing in English – whatever her nationality, country of residence, age or subject matter – is eligible.\n\nThe judges for the 2015 Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction judges are:\n\nShami Chakrabarti, (Chair), Director, Liberty\n\nLaura Bates, Writer and Founder of The Everyday Sexism Project\n\nGrace Dent, Columnist and Broadcaster\n\nHelen Dunmore, Novelist, Poet and Winner of the Inaugural Orange Prize for Fiction\n\nCathy Newman, Presenter, Channel 4 News\n\n“Congratulations to Ali Smith whose winning novel How to Be Both reflects the brilliance and originality that the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction proudly celebrates,” commented Syl Saller, Chief Marketing Officer, Diageo. “This year’s shortlist showcased an outstanding variety of female talent and Baileys is passionate about working with the Prize to share their extraordinary works with more people than ever before. Ali follows in the footsteps of 19 brave and talented Women’s Prize winners, and she is an inspiration for aspiring female writers all over the world.”\n\nNovelist & Co-Founder of the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction, Kate Mosse, said: “In this, our twentieth year, it is wonderful to see our partnership with Baileys going from strength to strength. Our retail and media partnerships in 2015 have been hugely successful in promoting outstanding fiction by women to an even wider range of readers, both in the UK and throughout the world.”\n\nAli Smith\n\nAli Smith was born in Inverness in August 1962 and lives in Cambridge. She won the Saltire First Book Award and a Scottish Arts Council Award in 1995 for her first collection of stories, Free Love and has since published three further collections including Other Stories and Other Stories and The First Person and Other Stories.\n\nShe is the author of several novels including Hotel World, which was shortlisted for the Booker and the Orange Prize, and The Accidental which won the Whitbread Novel Award. Her non-fiction includes Artful, which won the 2013 Bristol Festival of Ideas/Best Book of Ideas.\n\nHow to Be Both was shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize and 2015 Folio Prize and won the 2014 Costa Novel Award, 2014 Goldsmiths Prize and Saltire Literary Book of the Year 2014 award. In 2007 Ali Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and was made a CBE for Services to Literature in the 2014 New Year’s Honours List.\n\nAbout How to Be Both\n\nHow to Be Both is a novel all about art’s versatility. Borrowing from painting’s fresco technique to make an original literary double-take, it’s a fast-moving genre-bending conversation between forms, times, truths and fictions. There’s a renaissance artist of the 1460s. There’s the child of a child of the 1960s. Two tales of love and injustice twist into a singular yarn where time gets timeless, structural gets playful, knowing gets mysterious, fictional gets real – and all life’s givens get given a second chance.\n\nPick up your copy online here!\n\nPrevious winners are – Eimear McBride for A Girl is a Half-formed Thing (2014), A.M. Homes for May We Be Forgiven (2013), Madeline Miller for The Song of Achilles (2012), Téa Obreht for The Tiger’s Wife (2011), Barbara Kingsolver for The Lacuna (2010), Marilynne Robinson for Home (2009), Rose Tremain for The Road Home (2008), Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for Half of a Yellow Sun (2007), Zadie Smith for On Beauty (2006), Lionel Shriver for We Need to Talk About Kevin (2005), Andrea Levy for Small Island (2004), Valerie Martin for Property (2003), Ann Patchett for Bel Canto (2002), Kate Grenville for The Idea of Perfection (2001), Linda Grant for When I Lived in Modern Times (2000), Suzanne Berne for A Crime in the Neighbourhood (1999), Carol Shields for Larry’s Party (1998), Anne Michaels for Fugitive Pieces (1997), and Helen Dunmore for A Spell of Winter (1996).\n\nThe awards took place in The Clore Ballroom of the Royal Festival Hall, central London. In addition to the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction winner announcement, aspiring novelist Claire Rilett was named as the winner of the Baileys Women’s Prize/Grazia First Chapter Competition for unpublished writers.\n\nBaileys and the Prize share a mutual purpose, to celebrate brilliant women and their shared ambition is to bring the best women’s writing and female storytellers to ever-wider audiences.\n\nIn November this year, Baileys launched their latest campaign celebrating the power of female friendship and the great things that happen when girls get together. The campaign sees the introduction of the brand’s new endline ‘Here’s to us’, which invites women to get out there with their girls, wherever they are in the world, and toast them with a Baileys.\n\nBaileys was the world’s first cream liqueur, the perfect balancing act of aged Irish whiskey woven with fresh Irish dairy cream, a hint of cocoa and vanilla. It’s also the world’s biggest seller, with over 82 million bottles sold world wide each year. Every minute of every day over 2000 people around the world are enjoying a Baileys. (And it’s IRISH, just thought I’d throw that in, Ed)"
