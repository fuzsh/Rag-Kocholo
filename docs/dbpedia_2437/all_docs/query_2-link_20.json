        "text": "The Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction has been awarded to the British author Rose Tremain for her 10th novel, “The Road Home.” The prize, awarded annually for the best novel written by a woman in English and published in Britain in the previous year, was presented at a ceremony Wednesday night in London. Ms. Tremain, who writes novels, short stories and screenplays, received £30,000, or nearly $59,000, for the novel, which tells the story of Lev, a shy Eastern European widower who comes to Britain in search of work and experiences the dissonance of the immigrant diaspora. Recent Orange Prize winners include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie for “Half of a Yellow Sun” in 2007 and Zadie Smith for “On Beauty” in 2006."
