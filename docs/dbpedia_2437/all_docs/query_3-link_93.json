        "text": "Winners Will Be Honored At Awards Ceremony On November 13th In New York City, Co-Hosted By CBS News' Dr. Emily Senay And CNN's Dr. Steve Salvatore\n\nShare This Story:\n\nTweet\n\nSeptember 16, 1999 -- New York -- The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, PBS, The Learning Channel, HBO, Discovery Health, NIH, ABC News, and HBO are among the winners of the 1999 International Health & Medical Film Competition, known as the \"Oscars of Medicine.\" Winners will be presented with the coveted FREDDIE Award at a black-tie ceremony in New York City on November 13th. The announcement was made by Donna Hill Howes, executive producer.\n\nThe International Health & Medical Film Competition has evolved into the world's preeminent film festival devoted to educational health and medical films for both professionals and consumers. The Competition, which brings together Hollywood and medicine, attracts feature-length films, documentaries, shorts, video, and new media from around the world that are dedicated to exploring health-related issues. Filmmakers compete in 40 categories for the coveted FREDDIE, the Competition's bronze statue.\n\nThe FREDDIE Awards are sponsored by many of America's leading and emerging health companies. The 1999 corporate sponsors are listed below. Special Award Sponsors for 1999 are DISCOVERY Health Media, Inc., Glaxo Wellcome, Medscape, and Medsite.com.\n\nThe awards will be presented at a black-tie gala 25th anniversary celebration in New York City at the Pierre Hotel on November 13th, to an audience of over 600 pharmaceutical and advertising executives, producers and celebrities. Joining Time Inc Health in hosting the event, will be Dr. Emily Senay and Dr. Steve Salvatore, medical correspondents for CBS News and CNN, respectively. Discovery Health and CNN will be airing the program following the event. CNN will also tape the entire awards program and provide feeds for other networks to air.\n\nTime Inc Health, a division of Time Warner, purchased the Competition from the American Medical Association last year. Time Inc Health is a leading provider of health news and information to consumers. Launched in 1987, its flagship publication, HEALTH, is the country's premier healthy lifestyle title and a four-time National Magazine Award winner. The Company also produces trade books; custom publishing products for managed care, pharmaceutical companies, and other healthcare clients; a daily health spot on the CBS radio network. Time Inc Health will also launch HEALTH.com later this year.\n\nSource: Time Inc Health"
