        "text": "The award was won by internationally acclaimed artist Steve McQueen, for his film and video works. In awarding him the prize the jury admired the poetry and clarity of his vision, the range of his work, its emotional intensity and economy of means.\n\n1999 saw attendance rise to a record 140,000, with an average of 2,000 visitors a day. Media coverage was dominated by Tracey Emin’s work My Bed – an installation of her unmade bed complete with dirty sheets and detritus – which provoked an extreme critical response. The high visibility of My Bed in the tabloid press prompted culture secretary Chris Smith to criticise the jury for deliberately selecting ‘shock’ installations that gave the country a bad name abroad. However, the award was won by internationally acclaimed artist Steve McQueen, for his film and video works."
