        "text": "Show Off\n\n1999 Darwin Award Winner\n\nUnconfirmed by Darwin\n\n(August 1999) A 27-year-old man, bent on impressing three boys, dove into the ocean from an 80-foot cliff. He was knocked unconscious by the impact with the water. One of the boys, unimpressed, climbed down the cliff and dragged the man from the sea while his friends called for help. The impetuous man was airlifted from Skrinkle Haven to Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, where he was declared dead on arrival. Police reported that that the rescuer, an 11-year-old boy, acted very bravely. His 14-year-old comrades were also commended for their presence of mind.
