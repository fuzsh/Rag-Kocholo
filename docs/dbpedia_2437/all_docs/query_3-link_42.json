        "text": "It was 1999 when Gwyneth Paltrow won Best Actress at the 73rd Oscars for her leading role in Shakespeare in Love. Wearing a pink Ralph Lauren gown she clutched the gold statuette and fought back tears as she thanked a long list of people. The win was controversial at the time with Glenn Close later saying that it “didn’t make sense”.\n\nIn an interview with the TODAY Show overnight, the actress recalled what she learnt through the experience. “I think it was probably around the time of winning the Oscar where you go from people kind of being curious about you or discovering you or rooting for you to it all being upended, and people really wanting to tear you down and take great pleasure in it,” she said.\n\n“Which ends up being a really beautiful lesson in knowing who you are,” Paltrow continued. “Loving the people you love. Being totally in integrity. And like f**k everybody else.”\n\nPaltrow went on to appear in films such as Shallow Hal and the Avengers but said in a past interview on SiriusXM’s Quarantined with Bruce, that at 26 she realised she “didn’t love acting as much as she thought”. Since her Oscars win, the actress was thrust under intense public scrutiny which led to Paltrow eventually launching her own wellness newsletter Goop in 2008 and stepping back from Hollywood. In 2016 she took over Goop as CEO."
