Andrew Holgate, Literary Editor of The Sunday Times completes the line-up. The award is worth £30,000 to the winning writer.\n\nThe Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award is a hugely respected international prize open to any novelist or short story writer from around the world who is published in the UK. Last year’s winner was Jonathan Tel, the first Briton to win the prize. Previous winners of the prize include three Pulitzer Prize-winning American authors – Junot Díaz, Anthony Doerr and Adam Johnson – as well as the celebrated Chinese American writer Yiyun Li, CK Stead from New Zealand and Kevin Barry from Ireland. Shortlisted authors have include Colum McCann, Petina Gappah, Hilary Mantel, Emma Donoghue, David Vann and Gerard Woodward.\n\nThe judges are looking for an outstanding English-language story of 6,000 words or under. The winner will receive £30,000, and the five shortlisted writers will each receive £1,000. The deadline for entries this year is 6pm (GMT) on 29 September 2016 and entry forms can be found here. A longlist will be announced in February 2017, followed by a shortlist of six in March 2017. The winner will be announced at a gala dinner in London on Thursday 27th April 2017.\n\nAnne Enright comments:\n\nThe best gifts come in small packages. A good short story leaves nothing out, it is just the right size for itself, says something both old and unexpected, and leaves a wonderful silence in its wake. Writers do not produce short stories for money but for pleasure. They write a story because it is there. This competition puts value where the market does not; it celebrates the least of prose forms and the best.\n\nAndrew Holgate comments:\n\nThe Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award has always been known for its striking judging panels, but this is one of the strongest and most experienced panels we have ever had, and I am hugely grateful to all four of my fellow judges for their belief in the prize and its aim to celebrate short fiction. The award, which has been generously sponsored right from the beginning by the private bank EFG, is now firmly established as one of the highlights of the literary calendar, and this year, the eighth in which it has been given, promises to be something special.\n\nFor full details of the Award visit: www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/shortstoryaward\n\nKeep up-to-date with the Award via Twitter #STEFG and Facebook\n\nDownload the full press release >>\n\nMore about the judges\n\nAnne Enright\n\nAnne Enright was born and now lives and works in Dublin.
