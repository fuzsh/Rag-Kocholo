        "text": "Who wrote it?\n\nRose Tremain (1943- ; active 1976- ), born London, UK. She was born Rosemary Jane Thomson, marrying Jon Tremain in 1971. though the marriage lasted only five years. She studied at the Sorbonne for two years before studying English Literature at the University of East Anglia in Norfolk (where she still lives).\n\nShe has written fairly prolifically, with 16 novels, 5 short story collections, a children’s book and a memoir amongst her output. Her debut Sadler’s Birthday (1976) attracted attention from the literary establishment and marked her out as ‘promising’. Her first award was the 1984 Dylan Thomas Prize, then for young authors, by which time she was already a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nShe was Booker shortlisted in 1989 for Restoration, a historical novel set in the reign of Charles II (a tough year: The Remains of the Day, one of my favourites, went on to take the Prize). She had judged the Booker in 1988, and went on to do so again in 2000, but to date has not been shortlisted again. She won the Whitbread Prize in 1999 for Music and Silence (another historical novel) and was shortlisted again (in the Prize’s later Costa incarnation) for The Gustav Sonata in 2017, which was also longlisted for the Women’s Prize. Her most recent novel is Lily: A Tale of Revenge (2021) and in 2020 she was awarded a Damehood for her services to literature.\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nThe Road Home focuses on Lev, a middle-aged widower from an unspecified Eastern European country (possibly Poland), as he travels to London with the goal of making money to support his young daughter who stays back home with his mother. The novel begins as one of survival, as Lev acclimatises to the harsh realities of living in London with no money and no job. He initially sleeps rough and makes small change delivering leaflets for a kebab shop, before landing a job as a dish-washer (or “nurse”) in the high pressure kitchen of GK Ashe, a fine-dining, Gordon Ramsey style establishment. He eventually finds himself a (child size) room with recent Irish divorcee Christy, with whom he forms an endearing friendship.\n\nAlong the way, he rejects the advances of his well-meaning compatriot Lydia, falls for GK Ashe sous chef Sophie, and manages to disgrace himself with both women, in the latter case finding himself sacked from the restaurant. For a time, he falls into despair and moves to the East Anglian countryside and lives as a vegetable picker with other immigrants, having seemingly lost hope of improving his lot in life. Via regular calls to his best pal back home, Rudi, he discovers that the government back home is planning to erect a dam in the vicinity of his home village that will flood the area and lead to forced evictions. This spurs him back to action, formulating a plan to support his family and friends back home and play a role in the regeneration of his region. The novel ends with him having achieved his goals, but still pondering what has been lost along the way.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nIt’s an easy, compelling read. A page turner, for sure. I was invested in the well-drawn central character and keen to find out where life took him. It’s one of the more straightforwardly ‘readable’ winners of the two major Prizes I’ve been reading. It’s a simple, linear narrative with no deep subtext or particular showiness.\n\nIt’s funny, in fact feeling broadly comic in tone despite tackling some ‘issues’ along the way. The humour is relatable, down to earth, and not the sort of bleak humour that often permeates prizewinners. Rudi and his ’Tchevi’ reminded me very much of the humour in Everything is Illuminated - a warm-hearted comic portrayal of a certain type of Eastern European.\n\nAs reviewers even at the time commented, it’s a bold move by Tremain as an English writer to tackle immigration so thoroughly from the perspective of an immigrant. Yet it’s a broadly successful risk - her depiction of Lev is humane and likeable, and it feels like Tremain has a deep empathy for him and his counterparts. As I note below, it’s not flawless but in general it’s done well.\n\nNovels dealing with very timely and contemporarily relevant issues feel surprisingly few and far between among the major prizewinners,. so it’s always somewhat refreshing when they do show up like this.\n\nIt’s a deeply felt and emotional book in places, particularly around the two men’s relationship with their young daughters.\n\nWhat I didn’t like\n\nIn general, it felt a little too ‘cosy’ for my liking. I get that that’s probably a part of its popularity, but it rarely feels truly reflective of the way the world works. It’s a broadly optimistic novel, determined to find the good in everyone and everything, and ends up on occasion feeling a little oversimplified and ‘inspirational quote’-like. I can’t help but feeling that it’s a product of its time - reflecting a liberal positivity towards immigration that is hugely commendable but leads to a lack of real interrogation of the pernicious forces that we’re all too aware of now that oppose immigration, and were undoubtedly present at the time in more threatening forms than we see in The Road Home. I guess we’ve been through a lot as a country since 2008. I’d almost love to see Tremain return to Lev’s story somehow post-Brexit and see if that spirit of optimism bears scrutiny in 2022.\n\nThere’s also a little too much reliance on coincidence and unlikely happenings. Quite a lot of suspension of disbelief is required for what’s essentially a realist novel, from the minor (Lev has to scrape together the pennies to eat but has seemingly infinite phone calls available to dial Rudi & co back home) to the more significant (Tremain speeds through his unlikely rapid accumulation of a large sum of money with the speed of an uplifting montage in a cheesy movie - we’re not given any insight into life working 2 jobs for 6 days a week, it’s just a convenient way of having him - supposedly quickly - rack up the necessary cash).\n\n(Perhaps I’m being a bit harsh here - Make it bleaker! Make it less fun! - but it just feels a bit fluffy compared to many prize winners)\n\nI really didn’t enjoy the caricatures of London celebs being used as significant characters. GK Ashe is pretty obviously Gordon Ramsey but just about bearably not exactly the same, whereas the guy that essentially is Damien Hirst was just too irritating for my liking. Their existence made me think of that later period Adrian Mole book where he works in a London kitchen. Either that or something out of a Bridget Jones book. Much as I love Mole, too incongruous by far here.\n\nOK, after all that, let’s examine the real crime here: that cover. We all know never to judge a book by it, but this one is surely is taking that challenge and running with it.. to an extreme?! Can someone please explain to me what it has to do with a book that’s primarily based in the gritty urban landscape of London? If it was a dammed reservoir, or something, fine, or an asparagus field (pretty sure it’s not that at least) but otherwise… WTF?\n\nFood & drink pairings"
