        "text": "Zone of Interest begins, for a seemingly inordinate length of time, with a black screen and a formless drone music. But when the music stops and the screen clears we are in an idyllic setting: trees, bushes, a sparkling clear stream in the middle ground, and in the middle of all this green a small group of people mostly in white. Their whiteness, and the fact that they are people, makes us focus on the group. But we don’t go close, we can’t really make out what they are doing, we can’t hear what they are saying. Perhaps a family group, a picnic? Someone is splashing in the river, some of the men seem to be preparing to swim, the women and the youngest children are gathering things together and heading off towards the left. When the camera finally drifts away from this scene we see what seems to be the entire group making their way through dense undergrowth. Yet still we are not close to these people, still we are not required to pay attention to anything they might be saying. We guess, and it will soon be confirmed, that among this group are the central figures of this film, but we can’t identify them with any certainty. Indeed, if this opening tells us anything, it is that these people are unimportant, that we should not pay too much attention to them.\n\nRather, what struck me about this opening was the colour. The whiteness of the people is supposed to be symbolic of purity, but that is not how I interpreted it. Because the people are diminished by the setting in which we see them, and that setting is green. Indeed it is impossible to count how many shades of green are displayed by this crowd of trees and bushes. And green is the colour of life, of freshness, of rebirth. Against that backcloth, the people are not white but colourless, a gap, an emptiness in this profusion of life and growth. I already knew, from the posters for the film, how visually important the green lawn up against the wall of the camp was. Green: we never see inside the camp (other than the anonymous roofs of a few buildings and, of course, the chimneys), but I will lay odds that green is not a colour that was seen much inside the camp. This opening emphasis on green, therefore, is potent precisely because it makes us pay attention to absence, to what is not being shown in the film.\n\nAnd this is a film that is all about what is not on the screen.\n\nThe other thing that this opening tells us about how to watch the film is also referred to above, when I say that we are not required to pay attention to what the characters say. There is, so far as I remember, no major element in the film revealed through dialogue. In fact the sheer banality of most of what is said is a large part of the point of the film. Writing about Adolf Eichmann, Hannah Arendt talked of the banality of evil, and this film, concentrating on someone a few rungs lower down the extermination ladder, seems like a literalization of that perception. We see a prisoner deliver a large black bag to the house; it is taken off him wordlessly, no thank you, nothing, his presence is not acknowledged. There is a local Polish girl who works as a servant in the house, again she never receives a thank you, in fact practically the only time she is spoken to is when she is admonished. They live in a silence that excludes everything around them, except there is no silence, as I will mention later.\n\nThe house is quite large, fitting for their status, but in terms of decor and furnishings it is nothing special, a rather dull suburban home because these are rather dull suburban people. Only its location makes it special. The bag that the prisoner delivered contains a selection of clothes which the lady of the house and her close friends share out between them; a stylish gown, a long fur coat. These have presumably been confiscated from new arrivals at the camp; everything that these people have to give them an appearance of glamour or stylishness is stolen from the prisoners. The fur coat has a ripped seam that will need to be repaired, presumably where its original owner tried to secrete some valuables.\n\nThe woman is Hedwig Höss, the wife of Rudolf Höss, the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz. They are dull, ordinary people with nothing of interest to say. They owe their position to Rudolf’s willingness to carry out the ruthless dictates of the regime without anything that comes close to a qualm. Their house, with its garden tended by anonymous prisoners, its lawn and pool, are all that really matter to them. When Rudolf is transferred to Oranienburg outside Berlin, Hedwig chooses to stay at Auschwitz because she values the house and, presumably, the status it confers. It is said that one of the reasons Höss was transferred is because he was having an affair with one of the communist prisoners. This is alluded to when we see a drab-looking girl in prison uniform come into his office and begin to take off her shoes, then later Höss goes to a washroom and very carefully begins to clean his genitals. But the film makes no explicit link between this incident and the transfer. Höss is, if anything, more alive when we see him talking to a couple of engineers about a new design of the crematorium which would allow the ovens to be in constant operation.\n\nMostly, what we see is everyday stuff with nothing of any import happening. Officers gather to wish Höss a happy birthday. Höss rides the few yards from his home to the camp upon his beloved horse. Hedwig’s mother comes to visit, and wonders whether one of the camp inmates is a posh Jewish woman she used to know and didn’t like. Children play in the garden and pool. Höss goes fishing in the river. The dialogue is as everyday as the events we witness. But that is not where our interest lies. Because although we see nothing of the camp beyond the upper stories of a couple of nondescript buildings, and smoke rising from a couple of chimneys, the camp is ever present, and it is the noise of the unseen camp that is the focal point of the film. Always present but never acknowledged, there is shouting, screams, gunshots, and various other noises. These are indistinct, when there is shouting we can never tell what is being shouted, but it never goes away. It settles over the tidy suburban life of the household just as, we imagine, ash from the constantly belching chimneys settles over the washing hung out on the line. When Hedwig’s mother visits, she wakes in the night to noises that sound louder and more threatening than ever (I thought for a moment that it was the sound of battle, but the internal chronology means this must have been the summer of 1943, far too early for Russian forces to have started approaching Auschwitz). In the morning, she has left before anyone else in the household has risen. This is the only acknowledgement in the film that anyone in the household is even aware of the immediate, looming presence of the camp. What we see in the film is people choosing to ignore; what we hear on the soundtrack is what they are ignoring.\n\nOne final point: the film takes its title from a novel by Martin Amis, but it is not the film of the novel. I dislike Amis’s writing, so I haven’t read the book and probably never will. But I checked it out when I knew I was going to see the film. Amis does not use the real names of Höss or his family, and the novel concerns a fictional affair between Hedwig and another officer. None of this appears in the film; so far as I can see, only the setting and the title derive from the novel.\n\nAnd the film spells nothing out. There is, towards the end, a brief glimpse of women cleaning exhibits in the Auschwitz Museum, but otherwise there is no reference to after the war. The household right against the wall of the camp is the entire universe, without beginning or end. We learn, only after returning home to do some research, that Rudolf Höss was hung in 1947, that Hedwig lived into her 80s, that their youngest child, seen only as a baby in the film, has publicly bemoaned the fact that modern Germans cannot celebrate Nazism. Perhaps there is no end, perhaps there is no after.\n\nI’m sure it will come as no surprise to anyone reading this blog that I like books about literature, about literary history, and about literary criticism. So I was always going to be the target audience for Peter Kemp’s Retroland: A Reader’s Guide to the Dazzling Diversity of Modern Fiction. And I am glad I picked it up. I do have probably as much in the way of gripes and criticisms as I have praise for the book, but that is almost inevitable in a work like this. But in the main I found it an exhilarating romp through primarily English fiction since about 1970. That starting date is arbitrary, and not really explained, but it does give us a half-century of literature to consider, and I suppose it means Kemp gets in ahead of what is likely to be a rush of books in the next couple of years that will be looking back at the first quarter of this century, or perhaps starting in 1975 to compare the last quarter of last century with the first quarter of this, or even more expansively perhaps considering the century from 1925. I don’t know about you, but I’m already getting a vague sense that the 1920s are starting to crop up in books more frequently than I remember, though that could just be the direction my own interests take me.\n\nThe first thing to be said about Retroland is that the sub-head is irrelevant. There are a lot of novels covered in this volume, so it is diverse in that sense, but the book is not about diversity, it is not about the dazzle. Kemp has a theme, and the book focuses narrowly on how the fiction of the last half-century has stuck to that theme, explored it and played games with it. Which in a very real sense is the opposite of diversity.\n\nKemp’s theme is history, and his thesis is that the novelists (at least the British novelists) of the period have overwhelmingly turned to the past for their subject, their inspiration, or their model. Kemp’s focus on this is so narrow that any writer (by which I mean mainstream novelist, I will come later to discuss Kemp’s engagement, or lack of it, with genre fiction) who deals exclusively with the present (Ali Smith, Iain (no-M) Banks) does not appear in the book, which can rather skew the perspective. But okay, I will concede the point, since so many of the contemporary novelists that I return to again and again (Kate Atkinson, William Boyd, Sarah Perry, Graham Swift) do turn frequently, sometimes exclusively, to the past.\n\nThere is, of course, an issue here that I don’t think is adequately addressed in the book; two issues, in fact. The first is: what does it mean that so many contemporary writers have turned to the past in this way? Are they saying that today can only be thoroughly understood by examining yesterday? Are they saying that the ills of today have their source in the wrongs of yesterday? Or, by contrast, are they saying that the well-formed past holds up a mirror to the ill-fared present? I don’t know, but Kemp has so much ground to cover that he must perforce spend more time on the ways the past is addressed and not on why it is so addressed. But then there’s another issue that only occurred to me as I was writing this: is the past really a phenomenon peculiar to post-1970 fiction? Let’s face it, British writers (and something like 90% of the writers covered here are British) have been writing about the past since at least Walter Scott. Dickens was an historical novelist, so was Stevenson, so were heaven knows how many others. How many of the interwar crime novelists (Dorothy L. Sayers) infused their work with references to the Great War; or turned even further back (Josephine Tey)? So, are we talking about a mode that fell out of fashion only to become prominent again after 1970, or something that had always been there? The answer to that question would change our perspective on the works considered here, but I’m not sure the question is even asked.\n\nYet, although I was aware of these niggles, they didn’t bother me as I was reading the book, I was too caught up in the narrative. Now a book of this nature inevitably comes down to lists, and there are a lot of them spread through the book. When you are reading such lists your mind inevitably snags on the names that are missing, and these clearly indicate gaps in the author’s knowledge. In one list there is an allusion to Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life, but neither she nor the book are named anywhere in this volume; so he knows of the book but is not familiar enough with it, or anything else by Atkinson, to recognise how she fits within his thesis. In a chapter devoted to updatings of the story of Frankenstein there is no mention of Poor Things by Alasdair Gray, indeed Gray appears nowhere in the book which seems to me like a fatal shortcoming. But no one can read everything, be aware of everything, and Kemp covers a lot of ground, writers I like and writers I have never previously heard of. So yes, there are writers I would have thought central to the thesis that are absent, but that hardly undermines what the book does achieve.\n\nAnd the lists, let’s face it, are not the be-all-and-end-all of the book. Far more interesting and valuable are the longer, more considered, more detailed accounts of particular authors or works. I can hardly fault him here, for he takes us into the work of writers I rate highly (David Mitchell, Pat Barker, Peter Carey, Hilary Mantel, William Golding, Angela Carter, and a writer he returns to several times and who is, I feel, one of the very best novelists of the last half-century, Barry Unsworth) or whose work I’ve only dipped in to and feel I need to study more (J.L. Carr, Toni Morrison, Jim Crace, Sarah Moss). It’s a book that makes you excited about books, there’s a feast of stuff here I want to grab immediately and read all at once.\n\nNot that Kemp is uncritical; far from it. You can tell his favourites (Unsworth, A.S. Byatt), but he is not afraid to turn a sharp critical attention upon writers usually considered critical darlings. Salman Rushdie: “For an author who attaches such significance to storytelling, Rushdie is curiously inept at telling stories.” Jeanette Winterson: “Amid a jumble of researched scientific data that characters reel out, the basic lineaments of Mary Shelley’s Gothic fable — science over-reaching itself, hubris hideously punished, malformed loneliness tragically wreaking havoc — get peculiarly garbled.” Margaret Drabble: “This dismissal of psychological fiction and Freudian thinking comes strangely in a trilogy whose most pervasive character is a psychiatrist.” There are skewering one-liners all through the book which contribute immensely to its liveliness, the sense that some great novelists and some not-so-great novelists are producing work that we really should be paying attention to, and conversely that there are supposedly great novelists who should be paying more attention to their work.\n\nPeter Kemp is a reviewer for the Sunday Times and the author of books on Muriel Spark and H.G. Wells, a background which, you might think, might open him to writing that doesn’t follow a straightforwardly realist model. And it does, but not in the way you might think. The second of the five parts that make up this book concentrates on the fictions that show how an individual’s past shapes their present. One of the examples of this motif is the way childhood trauma, and particularly child abuse, are repeatedly shown to lie behind the darkness in a character. He presents several fictional examples of this, but as I was reading it I kept thinking how frequently I have seen this pattern in crime fiction, it is, for instance, a regular feature in John Banville’s Benjamin Black novels, and yet neither Black nor crime fiction more generally feature among his examples. Crime fiction does appear in the book, but usually in other forms, the historical crime fiction of C.J. Sansom, Steven Saylor, or Lindsey Davis, for example.\n\nUnexpectedly, science fiction fares better. But that is partly because so many otherwise mainstream novelists have ventured into the form. And where science fiction does appear it is usually from writers not normally identified as science fiction authors: Martin Amis, P.D. James, Kazuo Ishiguro, Angela Carter. He is never dismissive of sf, and it clearly forms part of his overall vision of literature, but you get a sense of unease when he ventures into the territory. He spends some time discussing Ronald Wright’s updating of The Time Machine, A Scientific Romance (and he is clearly besotted with Wells’s original), but his reading of the book felt slightly off to me. He is outside his comfort zone, but at least he is willing to give it a go.\n\nThere is, I am sure, no such thing as a perfect book about literature. Any such book depends upon the taste and interest of the author, and a reading list that can at best only be partial. Though I suspect that it is such partiality (in both senses of the word) that is what makes these books interesting to me. And this is a pretty good example of the form.\n\nThe first of the Book Marketing Council’s “Best Young British Novelists” promotions in 1983 came at an odd time. The British publishing industry was struggling, mostly due to outdated methods, and a quick and dirty fix was needed. Hence the promotion. And it worked. Well, it did for me at least. Christopher Priest was the only one of the featured writers whose work I was already familiar with (by this time I’d read Philip Norman’s book on The Beatles, Shout!, but I’m not sure I associated the Philip Norman featured in the promotion with the author of that book), but I read the associated issue of Granta cover to cover (one of the few times I can say that of the magazine) and discovered a good handful of writers whose work interested me. For a while after that I would religiously buy each new book by Pat Barker, Julian Barnes, William Boyd, Kazuo Ishiguro, Adam Mars-Jones, Ian McEwan, and Graham Swift. I’ve read, with pleasure, the occasional novel by Rose Tremain and Lisa St Aubin de Teran, without consistently following their work, and though I’ve tried the occasional book by Martin Amis I’ve never really got on with his writing. Over the years, I stopped following most of these writers (Ishiguro I dropped quite quickly, then picked up again later and do now follow him). So today only Boyd and Swift are writers whose new work I religiously buy and read.\n\nWhich brings me to the latest William Boyd novel, Trio. What I like about Boyd is his storytelling, which is why it is no surprise that along the way he has written a couple of very effective spy stories. He does come up with some quite arresting metaphors and descriptive passages, but in the main his prose can be a little pedestrian. But his control of pace, revelation, drama, is powerful enough to keep you reading even if the writing might limp a little. Even so, I was a little startled by how flat the opening of this novel seemed:\n\nElfrida Wing stirred, grunted and shifted sleepily in her bed as the summer’s angled morning sun brightened the room, printing a skewed rectangle of lemony-gold light onto the olive-green-flecked wallpaper close by her pillow.\n\nYeah, that reads like someone trying too hard, like a writing-class exercise in stuffing as many descriptive words as possible into a single sentence. Then you turn the page to the start of chapter two (the chapters are short in this novel, mostly only two or three pages, which is one reason that the lumbering, over-emphatic description feels too much), and you read: “Talbot Kydd woke abruptly from his dream.” Then another couple of pages and another chapter begins: “Anny Viklund woke up and, as she did every morning as consciousness slowly returned, she wondered if this day was going to be the day that she died.”\n\nThree successive chapters beginning in exactly the same way: the full name of the character followed by a description of them waking up. It is laboured, repetitive, and it is hardly the most inspired or inspiring way to introduce the three central characters who make up the Trio of the title. I’ve come to expect fancier footwork than this from Boyd, even at his most pedestrian.\n\nWe are well over half way through the novel before it begins to dawn on us what Boyd is doing here. Elfrida is an alcoholic one-time novelist who hasn’t written anything other than fanciful titles for never-to-be-written books in over ten years. At the height of her fame, and to her perennial disgust, she was always called the new Virginia Woolf. It doesn’t help that she can’t stand Woolf’s work, which may be one of the reasons why she stopped writing. But now, between drinks of vodka from the countless old Sarson’s Malt Vinegar bottles she has stashed around the house, she gets an idea for a new novel, one that will lay the old ghost while getting her back into print: She will write a novel about the last day of Virginia Woolf.\n\nInevitably, she gets no further than the first paragraph, which she rewrites over and over again. A typical example reads:\n\nVirginia Woolf was sleeping. On the wall by her bed a pale parallelogram of lemony early-morning sunlight crept towards her face. When the sunlight hit her eyes, she grunted and turned over, but consciousness had indisputably dawned in her brain and was urging her awake.\n\nThe openings of the first three chapters are all variations on the opening of the Virginia Woolf novel. Elfrida herself grunts and shifts with the lemony light. Talbot’s dream figures in several of the putative openings, and his own story that follows will take the form of an awakening to a clearer understanding of what is going on around him (he is a film producer out of step with the modern world of the late-1960s, coming to terms with his own homosexuality, and also coming to recognise that his trusted partner is defrauding him). And Elfrida’s various opening paragraphs always end with Woolf recognising that “this was going to be the last day of her life”, echoing Anny’s own premonition. Anny is a young American film star brought to Britain to add cachet to the film Talbot is currently producing, but she also brings with her a host of troubles, mostly initiated by her former husband who is now a wanted terrorist, and the more she tries to run away from things the fewer places she has to turn, until the story does indeed end in her death.\n\nSo we have it: the three interweaving stories that make up this trio are all variations on the last day of Virginia Woolf. Elfrida herself is, of course, the most Woolf-like. At one point, frustrated that no publisher wants the novel she is planning (1968, when most of the novel takes place, was the nadir of interest in the Bloomsbury crowd) and beginning to suffer from DTs, and therefore in a mental state closely resembling that of Virginia Woolf in March 1941,she buys a secondhand fur coat, stuffs stones into the pocket, and plans to march into the Ouse near Woolf’s home at Rodmell. A farcical intervention stops this happening, and she ends up drying out in a religious establishment outside Taunton.\n\nIf Elfrida offers the closest parallel to Woolf, Talbot and Anny are the more engaging characters. This is because Elfrida has been defeated, knows it, and is complicit in her own downfall. Talbot and Anny are both bemused by events but are still trying to keep ahead of the game. Talbot succeeds, Anny doesn’t, perhaps ending as Woolf herself did (thought there is an unresolved mystery here), but at least there is more sense of them playing an active part in their own lives.\n\nThinking of Elfrida, I wonder how Boyd pitched this novel to his publisher. Things have moved on since 1968, the Bloomsberries are fashionable again, so to that extent he had an easier job. But still: “It’s a novel about the last day of Virginia Woolf, only it is set in 1968 and Woolf never appears.” Actually, Leonard Woolf is seen at a distance once, still living at Monk’s House and irrascibly chasing away would-be sightseers. In the end it’s a clever book, but perhaps more clever than good, a satisfying intellectual confection rather than something more engaging.\n\nWilliam Boyd, of course, would never think of giving one of his books such a dull title. Would he? But several times during the course of his new collection of short stories, The Dreams of Bethany Mellmoth, one or other of his characters will have written a novel, or a film script, or some such endeavour, called Oblong. It is clearly a joke, but not a very funny one.\n\nThe real joke is that Oblong would probably have been an appropriate title for the collection. It would, at least, suggest something of the continuity between the stories that he seems to be striving towards but signally fails to achieve.\n\nThese are, after all, virtually without exception, stories about novelists, film makers, art dealers, or would be members of such professions. Boyd has, himself, of course, experience in all three areas, so there is an insider feel to much of what we get here. But insider feel alone is not enough.\n\nI hold Boyd in high esteem, he has remained one of the most consistent and reliable of the novelists of that generation. While some of his contemporaries, Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, have become dull or irrelevant or self-satisfied, his work has tended to remain fresh, engaging, and well worth reading. Some of his novels (I would pick The New Confessions, The Blue Afternoon, Any Human Heart, and Sweet Caress) are, I think, particularly good. What makes them good is that Boyd is interested in story; there is always a strong plot thread running through his work which keeps us interested in the drama of what we are being told. Which may be why he is also so effective as a screenwriter and even as a director. The cross-over effect is obvious in his fiction not in the usual way, the jump cuts and dialogue that can make so many recent novels read more like film scripts, but in the way he focuses, the way small things acquire significance.\n\nUnfortunately, he has never carried those talents into his short fiction (there is one exception in this collection, but it is an odd exception and I will come to that later). This is the third or fourth of his five short story collections that I have read (if I read On the Yankee Station it was so long ago that I have forgotten all details, hence the hesitation; the collection, The Dream Lover, I know about only because it is listed with his other works in this volume, I don’t recall ever even seeing a copy). And I think the fact that I persist is a perfect example of the triumph of hope over experience: I always expect better of Boyd, I am always disappointed.\n\nBoyd simply seems to have forgotten the importance of story in stories. Instead he indulges in some overly familiar formal literary experimentation. One story of a relationship is told backwards from break-up to first meeting, adding nothing to the countless times we have seen exactly the same thing before. There’s a story told in diary entries, in which each of the diarists witness the same event, interpret it differently, and never fully understand what actually happened. Another story is told entirely through unsent letters. Actually this one is curious, an opportunity missed. Epistolary fiction is, of course, just about as old as English Literature, so the fact that the letters are unsent seems like a novelty, giving vent to rage and frustration. However, so much of the short fiction here is built around that good old typically English emotional experience, embarrassment; so if the letters had been sent the story could have acquired another emotional level as the author then rowed frantically back on his accusations and self-justifications. Maybe not; my thoughts turned this way only because I found the unsent letters themselves so unsatisfactory as a story.\n\nWhen he is not playing with form, Boyd’s stories tend to be concatenations of vignettes that are vaguely linked without ever really seeming to form a whole. The prime example here is the longest piece in the book, the novella, “The Dreams of Bethany Mellmoth”, which describes a series of brief encounters over two years in the life of a young woman. Bethany drifts from boyfriend to boyfriend, doomed to be disappointed by each one in turn and head back home to mother. She drifts from dead-end job to dead-end job, usually acquired through her mother who seems to be extraordinarily rich and well connected (this is not unusual, most of the stories are about rich and well-connected people, or people who move freely in such circles; it is an achingly middle class book). She drifts from artistic aspiration to artistic aspiration: at various times she is going to be an author, an actress, a photographer, a singer, without ever making much effort to pursue these aspirations. And at the end she drifts away from the story, and we re left to wonder what that was all about.\n\nOccasionally, Boyd seems to respond to some atavistic memory that there is supposed to be story in here somewhere. Thus in “Humiliation” a novelist gets revenge on the critic who savaged his latest book by feeding the critic a tainted oyster, which somehow feels more petty than dramatic.\n\nIn all of this, Boyd remains a fine writer. On a sentence-by-sentence level the work is engaging; the problem is that the sentences don’t seem to add up to anything. But there is, as I said, an exception: the very last piece in the book, a novelette called “The Vanishing Game: An Adventure …”, which, after what had gone before, I fell upon with cries of joy (so one does vaguely wonder whether the contrast makes it seem more, but I dismiss such thoughts as irrelevant). The story begins, oddly enough, with a quotation from Isaac Asimov; I wouldn’t have Boyd pegged as an Asimov fan, and there is certainly nothing science fictional in this or anything else he has written.\n\nThis is, in all honesty, a piece of nonsense that never quite makes sense, but it is also a story of constant action and intrigue somewhat in the manner of The Thirty-Nine Steps. The narrator is a second rate actor who makes a living appearing in cheap action films where he is usually the one who gets bumped off. He has been burgled, his car has been damaged, and his latest audition has turned into a fiasco. Then he is offered £1,000 in cash to drive a car up to a remote village in Scotland. He is happy to accept the offer, but ten suspicious things start to happen. He spots the same hitchhiker at different points along the journey; he realizes he is being followed by a mysterious black car; and so on. Then, when he gets to the place where he is supposed to make his delivery, he finds the woman who hired him apparently dead, though her body has disappeared by the time he gets the police to the spot. What follows is a fast-paced adventure set in a bleak Scottish moor. What makes the story is that the way he responds to each new threat, and the complicated plans he puts into effect to solve the puzzle are all derived from the cheap thrillers he has appeared in. The effect is both ludicrous and gripping, in fact the whole thing would make a good comedy drama for TV; indeed, I wonder if it wasn’t originally pitched as such. It is not as subtly done as the spy novels he has written, Restless and Ordinary Thunderstorms, and the resolution doesn’t quite work, yet the story stands head and shoulders above everything else in this collection precisely because it is a story."
