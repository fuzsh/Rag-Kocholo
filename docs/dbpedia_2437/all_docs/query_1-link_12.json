        "text": "Music and Silence by Rose Tremain 454pp, Chatto, £16.99\n\nMusic and silence, as Rose Tremain knows, are not necessarily opposites. They inhabit each other. Silence is given meaning by the music built around it. And much of the meaning of music resides in the unique character of silence that it engenders at its end. As I was reminded at a Prom recently, this is a truth unknown to those who begin clapping on the very instant that the music has stopped sounding. A work's one true live performance, with seconds of contemplative reverberance dissolving into stillness, can only happen on its world premiere - as happily was the case with David Matthews's thrilling Fifth Symphony, when the philistines were not forewarned of the finish. Hereafter, one glumly supposes, it is doomed to violent truncation.\n\nTremain's central character, Peter Claire, is a lutenist, and the lute embodies precisely this symbiotic intermingling, for the sound of a plucked string begins rapidly to fade as soon as it is sounded: the music is filled with a thousand tiny deaths. On the other hand, this superb novel, humming with music real and imagined, literal and figurative, knows very well the limits of the application of musical aesthetics to life: one character is determined that her love affair \"cannot end like this in a slow fading to silence\". Divorced from the taming, creative influence of music, silence becomes an avatar of despair.\n\nIt is 1629, and Peter Claire has arrived at the palace of King Christian IV of Denmark to join the court orchestra. Christian loves the spectral reverberance of music so much that he requires it to inform a whole performance, confining his players to a dank cellar, whence their sound floats up through an ingenious arrangement of pipes and trapdoors to waft around the King's comfortable listening room. They are a motley bunch, these musicians plucked from all over Europe, but their harmonies are famous, even though they must share a freezing dungeon with irritable, squawking hens. (Peter's colleague Jens remarks with comic mordancy that his sincere loves, of God and of music, serve merely to \"remind me that the world is a hideous and darkling pit from which I hope soon to escape.\" Meanwhile, Christian's wife Kirsten is dreaming of her flagellatory encounters with a certain Count, confiding her lascivious schemes to her \"private papers\" for our eyes. Kirsten's new serving-woman, Emilia, meets Peter in the court grounds and they fall in love at first sight. But then the adulterous Kirsten is banished from the court, taking Emilia with her.\n\nChristian, however, who calls Peter his \"angel\" on account of the lutenist's blond good looks, is not about to let the musician go; and besides Peter has grown to admire his King as they sit up for hours at night, discussing everything from the parlous state of Denmark's finances to the epistemology of love. The obstacles to the young pair's happiness are considerable.\n\nAway from the main road of this plot, we are also privy to the jottings of an Irish countess and the internal monologues of a five-year-old boy, Emilia's brother Marcus, whose thoughts are said to be (just as is Peter's lute music) \"plucked from the air\". With their skittish imaginary logic, these make up perhaps the best small-child ventriloquy in literature since William Faulkner's Vardaman, who is perhaps an influence here: \"She told me I killed my mother and now my mother can see me from the cloud where she lies and when it rains on the water in the horse trough that is her crying for me just in that little place.\" Marcus's father tells him he is in despair, not knowing what to do with the strange little boy. Marcus interprets him thus: \"I think Despair is a village. There is an inn and some houses there and an old man who sharpens knives.\"\n\nIt would be facile to say that Tremain's remarkable ability with first-person characterisation produces a harmonious polyphony. Of course musical polyphony requires simultaneity, which prose, no matter how energetically it intercuts between scenes, can only fake. As if to emphasize such formal incommensurabilities, Tremain gives us a wonderful sub-plot, one of many parables with which this story teems, involving a man who one night awakes from a beautiful dream of music and goes slowly mad trying to reproduce the phantom song on his keyboard. As the major plotlines drive along at gripping pace, Tremain still finds time to lavish attention on painterly miniatures, such as when Christ ian imagines how a waterfall can freeze in mid-flow, or laments his increasingly friendless middle age, \"in a grey desert where the horizon is unpeopled yet the ground is covered in shadows\".\n\nHow refreshing, by the way, to have a Good King as a major character. The crowning virtue of this novel is Tremain's restlessly probing sympathy, so that if no character is of totally unblemished virtue, neither is anyone thoroughly bad: life just has more \"teasing complexity\" than that. Tremain is especially virtuosic in managing our relationship with Kirsten: as soon as we are in danger of despising her selfishness, we are mollified by kittenish wit or a beam of kindness. Another character, the miserly Queen Sofie, softens in our judgment when she is given this touchingly generous explanation of Kirsten's behaviour: \"It is as though she is searching, by one means and another and all of them disreputable, to understand why she is alive.\"\n\n\"Denmark is full of ghosts,\" Christian tells Peter on their first meeting, and it is as though Hamlet's last words haunt the story as a warning: if Christian does not find some magic hoard of silver to restore his country's prosperity, or if Peter does not find his way back to Emilia, the rest will indeed be silence. Perhaps the idea of Shakespeare's unrivalled poetic genius, largely an artefact of the 18th century, was not quite so widespread in 1629 as it is made to seem in this novel, but Music and Silence is a wonderful, joyously noisy book.\n\nIf you would like to order a copy of Music And Silence at the special discount price of £13.99 (plus 99p p&p per order), call the Guardian Culture Shop on 0500 600102."
