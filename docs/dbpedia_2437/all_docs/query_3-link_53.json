        "text": "U.S. Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold Share 10th John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award\n\nBoston, MA, May 24, 1999 - The two U.S. Senators who reached across the aisle to join forces in a bi-partisan effort to reform the way political campaigns are financed were honored today by members of President Kennedy's family as the winners of the 1999 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, who sought to address their respective party's fundraising excesses and regulate the torrent of special interest money pouring into each party's coffers with the introduction of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation, were presented the prestigious award for political courage at a ceremony attended by President Kennedy's children, Caroline and John, his brother, Senator Edward Kennedy, and his sisters Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford, and Jean Kennedy Smith. Saturday would have been President Kennedy's 82nd birthday. It is the tenth Profile in Courage Award and the first to be shared by two elected American politicians.\n\n\"Senators McCain and Feingold demonstrated the kind of political courage my father admired most,\" said Caroline Kennedy, President of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. \"They defied the extraordinary pressures of partisan politics and special interests and stood up for what they felt was best for the country. In doing so, they suffered the displeasure of their party leaders and key constituency groups and even risked reelection to office. In a time when politics and government have been marked by incivility and partisanship, these senators distinguished themselves by their political courage and by their vision of what was right for the country.\"\n\nKennedy presented McCain and Feingold each with a sterling silver lantern representing a beacon of hope. The lantern, designed by Edwin Schlossberg, Inc. and crafted by Tiffany & Co., was accompanied by a $25,000 prize which Senators McCain and Feingold have instructed be donated to charity.\n\nIn presenting the Profile in Courage Award, Caroline Kennedy read the following citation:\n\nUnited in the belief that America's very democracy is threatened by the flood of money in our electoral system, two men, quite different in personal and political background, came together to propose real change and reform in the financing of this country's elections. In so doing, they have dedicated themselves to an issue that at first blush appears to have little public reward. Still, they have fought for their position with a determination and vigor that has put their public lives or political ambitions at risk.\n\nOne man, Senator Russell Feingold, seeking his first re-election to the United States Senate unilaterally adopted the financial restrictions he had proposed in the Senate - while his opponent was free to raise and spend money at will. While ultimately successful, a once comfortable race for re-election came as close to the edge of defeat as possible.\n\nThe other man, Senator John McCain, intent on his first attempt at capturing his party's nomination for the Presidency, stood in open and painful opposition to the position taken by his party's leadership. Despite the intense pressures and feelings that are unique to such internal political struggles, this man has once again in his life not wavered or sought relief from his situation.\n\nSuch acts of courage are of greater meaning in the context of today's public cynicism about whether people in elective office have the steel or resolve to stop the corrosive effect of money on the electoral process.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy warned that the \"high court of history\" would judge all elected officials one day on whether they were people \"with an honor mortgaged to no single individual or group, and compromised by no private obligations or aim, but devoted solely to serving the public good and the national interest.\"\n\nJohn McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, are two courageous men who have nothing to fear before the court of history.\n\nDescribed by one recipient as the \"Nobel in Government,\" the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award is presented annually to an elected official who has withstood strong opposition from constituents, powerful interest groups or adversaries to follow what they believe is the right course of action. The award is named for President Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer prize-winning book, Profiles in Courage , which recounts the stories of eight U.S. Senators who risked their careers to fight for what they believed in. The award, which is accompanied by a $25,000 stipend and a silver lantern representing a beacon of hope, was created by the Kennedy Library Foundation in 1989 and is presented annually, on or near May 29, in celebration of President Kennedy's birthday.\n\nSenators Feingold and McCain were chosen as the recipients of the tenth Profile in Courage Award by an 11-member committee whose chairman is John Seigenthaler, Chairman of the Freedom Forum at the First Amendment Center, Vanderbilt University. The committee's other members are: David Burke, former executive vice president of ABC News and president of CBS News; Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund; Edward M. Kennedy, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts; Caroline Kennedy, author, attorney, and president of the Kennedy Library Foundation; John F. Kennedy, Jr., editor, attorney and vice chairman of the Kennedy Library Foundation; David McCullough, historian and author of the Pulitzer prize-winning biography Truman; Mary Reed, entrepreneur and chairperson of the Kennedy Library Foundation's Education Committee; Alan Simpson, former U.S. Senator of Wyoming, and director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government; Olympia Snowe, U.S. Senator from Maine; and William vanden Heuvel, attorney, investment banker, and former special assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nConsidered to be the most vocal supporter of campaign finance reform in the Congress, Senator McCain first approached Senator Feingold in 1994 and asked him to join in drafting legislation that would limit the influence of private money in public life, level the political playing field between incumbents and challengers, and eliminate corruption.\n\nRepublican leadership strongly opposed the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation because it eliminated the advantage held by the Republican party in raising \"soft money,\" a euphemism for political donations that can be made without limit, through a loophole in the present laws, to a political party. And because the proposed legislation also reduced the financial advantage incumbents enjoyed over challengers, it enjoyed only the nominal support of many Democrats holding office. Although the bill had support from Common Cause, Public Citizen, the League of Women Voters and Public Campaign, its detractors -- including the ACLU, National Right to Life and the National Rifle Association -- argued that it would limit free speech.\n\nMcCain and Feingold nevertheless campaigned relentlessly for radical campaign finance reform, especially the ban on \"soft money.\" McCain's position put him in direct conflict with his party's leadership, particularly with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Senator Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nAlthough the McCain-Feingold legislation failed in the Senate, Senator Feingold still refused all offers of \"soft money,\" and some hard money in the form of contributions from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in his 1998 re-election bid against Wisconsin Republican Congressman Mark Neumann. Because of his own refusal to accept \"soft money\" and his opponent's acceptance of millions of dollars worth of negative advertising by the Republican Party, anti-abortion forces and other interest groups opposed to his reelection, Senator Feingold saw his 15 to 20 point lead in the polls over Neumann disappear. Feingold narrowly won his reelection by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, Senators McCain and Feingold re-introduced the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999.\n\nPast winners of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award are former U.S. Congressman Carl Elliott, Sr. of Alabama; former U.S. Congressman Charles Weltner of Georgia; former Governor of Connecticut Lowell Weicker; former Governor of New Jersey James Florio; U.S. Congressman Henry Gonzalez of Texas; former U.S. Congressman Michael Synar of Oklahoma; Calhoun County, Georgia School Superintendent Corkin Cherubini; Charles Price, Circuit Court Judge of Montgomery County, Alabama; and Garfield County, Montana Attorney Nickolas C. Murnion. In December, 1998, a special Profile in Courage Award was presented to eight political leaders of Northern Ireland and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, the chairman of the peace talks, in recognition of the extraordinary political courage they demonstrated in negotiating the historic Good Friday Peace Agreement.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Library and Museum - which celebrates its 20th birthday this year - is the nation's official memorial to John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States. Designed by architect I.M. Pei, the Library sits on a ten-acre, waterfront park on Boston's Columbia Point. The Kennedy Library is a presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration and supported, in part, by the Kennedy Library Foundation, a non-profit organization. The Kennedy Library and the Kennedy Library Foundation seek to promote, through educational and community programs, a greater appreciation and understanding of American politics, history, and culture, the process of governing and the importance of public service.\n\n-30-\n\nFurther Information:\n\nTom McNaught (617) 514-1656\n\nThank you. I am deeply grateful for the honor of this award. As often as we are targets of public abuse, politicians are also the beneficiaries of undeserved acclaim. After awhile, one keeps both scorn and praise in perspective. They come with the job.\n\nToday is different. I am genuinely moved by this award, and humbled by the high ideal it is intended to honor, and the excellent company that I keep as one half of the first shared Profile in Courage Award. In his last campaign, Russ Feingold gave to this nation an inspiring example of civic courage. It is one of the great privileges of my political career to be his partner in this, as yet unfinished, endeavor, and whatever comes of our effort, his friendship has made it a rewarding experience.\n\nThe cause of campaign finance reform serves two important purposes for me. One, which I will address in a moment, should be the common concern of all public officials – our honor. The other is the progress of conservative political reforms.\n\nI am a conservative, and I believe it is a very healthy thing for Americans to refrain from expecting too much from their government. Self-reliance is the ethic that made America great, not consigning personal responsibilities to the state.\n\nI like to think that we conservatives practice the self-reliance that we so devoutly believe to be a noble public virtue, and rely on our ideals and our integrity to enlist a majority to our cause, rather than subordinate those ideals to the imperatives of fundraising.\n\nI would hope that we would fight for those ideals as hard and as effectively as Ted Kennedy fights for his. I believe we need to reform government, make it smaller and less removed in style and substance from the people it serves. I believe we should reform our tax code. I believe we need to save Social Security and Medicare. I believe we need to reform liability laws. I believe we should genuinely deregulate the telecommunications industry. Indeed, there is virtually no end to the reforms I feel are important to the country, and which should be priorities on any conservative’s agenda.\n\nBut we will never achieve these reforms until we first reform the way we finance our political campaigns. As long as the influence of special interests dominates political campaigns, it will dominate legislation as well. Until we abolish soft money, Americans will never have a government that works as hard for them as it does for the special interests. That is a sad, but undeniable fact of contemporary politics.\n\nDuring hearings for the 1996 Telecommunications Act, every company affected by the legislation had purchased a seat at the table with soft money. Consequently, the bill attempted to protect them all, a goal that is obviously incompatible with competition. Consumers, who only give us their votes, had no seat at the table, and the lower prices that competition produces never materialized.\n\nWe can never agree on HMO reform because agreement is impossible when trial lawyers give lots of money to Democrats and insurance companies give lots of money to Republicans.\n\nIn truth, we are all shortchanged by soft money, liberal and conservative alike. All of our ideals are sacrificed. We are all corrupted. I know that is a harsh judgment. But it is, I am sorry to say, a fair judgment. And even if our own consciences were to allow us to hide from it, the people we are privileged to serve will not.\n\nMost Americans believe that we all conspire to hold on to every political advantage we have, lest we jeopardize our incumbency by a single lost vote. Most Americans believe we would let this nation pay any price, bear any burden to ensure the success of our personal ambitions – no matter how injurious the effect might be to the national interest. And who can blame them. As long as the wealthiest Americans and the richest organized interests can make six figure donations to political parties and gain the special access to power such generosity confers on the donor, most Americans will dismiss the most virtuous politician’s claim of patriotism.\n\nIn John Kennedy’s memorable phrase, “without belittling the courage with which men have died, we should not forget the courage with which men have lived.” I’ve seen more than my fair share of both kinds. And I could not forget them if I wanted to.\n\nI wish I could pretend to you and to myself that my efforts were comparable to the courage with which I have seen many good men live and die, and whose inspiration has given me heart in difficult times. But I cannot. For my actions are less a profile in courage than a profile in shame.\n\nWhen I was a young man, and all glory was self-glory, I responded aggressively and often irresponsibly to anyone who questioned my honor. I still remember how zealously a boy would attend the needs of his self-respect. But as I grew older, and the challenges to my self-respect became more varied and difficult, I was surprised to discover that while my sense of honor had matured, its defense mattered even more to me than it did when I believed that honor was such a frail thing that any empty challenge could threaten it.\n\nThe courage of the living and the dead taught me that. They taught me to dread dishonor above all other injuries. They taught me to be afraid of shame.\n\nI believe public service is an honorable profession. I believed that when I entered the Naval Academy at seventeen and I believe it still. I am an old man now, and I should be content with a life that has been more blessed than I deserve. But the people whom I serve believe that the means by which I came to office corrupt me. That shames me. Their contempt is a stain upon my honor, and I cannot live with it.\n\nThat is why I support the cause that you distinguish with this award. I thank you for it, and pledge that I will try to remain worthy of the honor.\n\nThank you.\n\nRemarks delivered by U.S. Senator John McCain, recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award Ceremony, May 24, 1999.\n\nUnited in the belief that America’s very democracy is threatened by the flood of money in our electoral system, two men, quite different in personal and political background, came together to propose real change and reform in the financing of this country’s elections.\n\nIn so doing, they have dedicated themselves to an issue that at first blush appears to have little public reward.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.\n\nThis is the tenth year of this annual award. It was instituted a decade ago by the Kennedy Library Foundation as a memorial to my brother, and as a way to encourage contemporary political leaders to be more willing to take on the tough issues, and to demonstrate the quality of political courage that my brother so admired and that is all too rare in public life today.\n\nOur goal in these awards is to honor political courage in contemporary elected officials, at whatever level of government they serve -- federal, state, or local. By doing so, we also hope to encourage the American people to value political courage more highly in their elected representatives.\n\nAs a young Senator in the 1950's, President Kennedy won the Pulitzer Prize for his book \"Profiles in Courage,\" which recounts the stories of famous Senators and other elected officials in American history who demonstrated political courage to an unusually high degree, by challenging their party leaders and powerful special interest groups in ways that often risked their own re-elections and careers.\n\nPresident Kennedy would have been especially proud of this year's award. The recipients are two especially courageous Senators, and the goal they have sought so courageously is at the heart of the integrity of our democracy — election campaign finance reform.\n\nAs Mark Twain once said, we have the finest political system that money can buy -- and it's a disgrace to our democracy. Money is the root of all evil in politics today, and it is responsible in substantial measure for the widespread and increasing alienation from the political process of citizens of all ages and in all parts of the country.\n\nJohn McCain and Russ Feingold had the political courage to face that challenge head-on, and to demand that Congress take a stand for principle and for clean campaigns, regardless of intense pressures from party leaders and special interest groups.\n\nIn the McCain-Feingold Bill, these two impressive Senators insisted that it is time to close the most scandalous loopholes festering in our election laws, and end the corrosive and corrupting power of big money in federal elections.\n\nIn a sense, the former Prisoner-of-War and the former Rhodes Scholar are the odd couple - but they are making common cause for true reform. And in doing so, they are bringing us a giant step closer to the ideal of clean elections, and a democracy that fully and fairly reflects the will of a free people. They are true profiles in courage for our time. I'm honored to be here with them today, and I wish we had more like them.\n\nRemarks of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on the presentation of the 1999 Profile in Courage Award to Senator John McCain and Senator Russell Feingold, May 24, 1999."
