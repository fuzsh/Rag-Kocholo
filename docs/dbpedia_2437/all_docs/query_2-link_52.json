Restoration was short-listed for the Booker Prize in 1989 and made into a film in 1995. The sequel, Merivel, was published to rapturous acclaim in 2012, and theTelegraph described the character of Robert Merivel as ‘one of the great imaginative creations in English literature of the past fifty years'.
