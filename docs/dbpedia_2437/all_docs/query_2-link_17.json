        "text": "Tremain was the bookmakers' favourite and she beat five other writers to the £30,000 women-only award.\n\nThe Orange Prize: reviews of shortlisted books\n\nIt is her 10th novel and success was all the sweeter because The Road Home was shortlisted for the Costa Book Award last year but failed to win.\n\nThe main character is Lev, an Eastern European who travels to Britain to seek work following the death of his wife. He arrives with no money and little English, and the story charts his struggle to adapt to life in an alien land, first in London and then in rural Suffolk.\n\nKirsty Lang, the broadcaster and chair of the judging panel, described the book as \"a powerfully imagined story and a wonderful feat of emotional empathy told with great warmth and humour\".\n\nTremain, who lives in Norfolk and was awarded the CBE for services to literature in th 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours, has won many literary prizes over her career, including the Whitbread Novel of the Year and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, but the Orange Prize has eluded her until now. She was nominated in 2004 for The Colour but lost out to Andrea Levy's Small Island.\n\nExplaining the subject matter for The Road Home, she said: \"I believe that when we think about people in a collective way – as, for instance, 'immigrants, 'foreigners', 'outsiders' etc – we tend to lack empathy with them and, almost invariably, to see their contribution to our society in a negative light. But the moment we become engaged with an individual story, empathy arrives and our attitudes alter.\"\n\nThe awards ceremony took place at the Royal Festival Hall on London's South Bank and much of the talk amongst the audience was of Lang's suggestion that men could be invited onto the judging panel for the first time.\n\nThe Orange Prize was set up 16 years ago in the belief that women writers were being overlooked for major literary awards, and the judges have always been female. Lily Allen, the pop singer, was included on this year's jury but dropped out due to problems in her personal life.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the ceremony, Lang said she was \"open-minded\" about the idea of a mixed panel. \"It would be an interesting debate for organisers to have. Seventy per cent of fiction is bought by women, so having a panel of women judges means they know what women like. But I thinkt it could be quite interesting to have a man on the panel.\""
