Rose Tremain collected the 'Bessie' award

Author Rose Tremain has been named as the winner of this year's Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction for her tenth novel The Road Home.

She won through a shortlist of six writers to take the prize, together with a Â£30,000 cheque, at London's Royal Festival Hall.

Author Joanna Kavenna won the new writer's award for novel Inglorious.

The awards were set up in 1996 to celebrate novels in English by women throughout the world.

Tremain, 65, who was also shortlisted for the prize in 2004, dedicated the award to Penny Hoare, her editor of more than 30 years.

She said her award added to a series of literary wins for female authors in the past year, including Doris Lessing's Nobel Prize.

"There is a lot to celebrate," proclaimed Tremain to cheers from the audience.
