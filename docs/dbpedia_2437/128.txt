‘The American Lover’ by UEA alumna Rose Tremain has been shortlisted for the 2014 BBC National Short Story Award. Rose (pictured) graduated from UEA with a BA in English in 1967. During her degree she was taught by both Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury, and later returned to the university to teach alongside Bradbury on the Creative Writing MA. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2000 and was made a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours of 2007. Her first novel ‘Sadler’s Birthday’ was published in 1976, and she has since published twelve more novels, four collections of short stories, one book for children and plays for radio and television. She won both the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award for ‘Music and Silence’ in 1999 and the Orange Prize for ‘The Road Home’ in 2007. Last year she was announced as the University’s new Chancellor, the first writer, the first woman, and the first UEA graduate to take on the role. This is the second time that she has been shortlisted for the BBC National Short Story Award, which is worth £15,000 to the winning author. The prize is run in partnership with Booktrust and the outcome will be announced on 30 September.
