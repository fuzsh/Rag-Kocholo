        "text": "The Suns wanted size, defense, rebounding and leadership and went for it in 32-year-old center Tyson Chandler.\n\nThe Suns kicked off free agency by setting on a five-year, $70 million contract with guard Brandon Knight, which matches Eric Bledsoe's deal from September, and added Chandler to fortify their middle as they continued pursued of star free agent LaMarcus Aldridge.\n\nRELATED: Suns make big pitch for LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nSources confirmed agreements for Knight and Chandler with ESPN.com reporting that Chandler's deal will be worth $52 million over four years. The Suns entered free agency with $12 million of cap space but could create more space. They have $16.2 million in cap holds for Brandan Wright and Gerald Green and a $5.5 million trade exception from the Goran Dragic deal.\n\nPHOTOS: Top NBA free agents of 2015\n\nChandler is a 14-year veteran who was the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2011-12. The 7-foot, 235-pounder has ranked in the NBA's top 10 for rebounding six times, including last season. He was a 2013 All-Star, an All-NBA third-team selection in 2011-12 and won an Olympic gold medal with Team USA in 2012.\n\nON FACEBOOK: Give us your reaction to Suns' deals\n\nMaking $14.6 million last season, Chandler averaged 10.3 points and 11.5 rebounds (fifth in the NBA) over 30.5 minutes per game. He is also an able pick-and-roll player who made 67 percent of his shots last season, keeping efficiently to opportunistic scores around the basket. Chandler is also a respected teammate and leader who will have the respect of the locker room and be able to mentor Suns 22-year-old center Alex Len.\n\nProfile: Tyson Chandler\n\nKnight, 23, was a restricted free agent but the Suns avoided any other team signing him to a four-year offer sheet by agreeing to give him a five-year contract. It is the same $70 million contract total that the Suns gave to Bledsoe after a summer-long standoff last offseason.\n\nMORE: NBA free agency getting off to a wild start\n\nThe Suns plan for Knight and Bledsoe to play together, although that rarely happened last season after Knight was acquired in February and missed 16 of the last 17 games for an ankle injury that required offseason surgery.\n\nKnight, who is 6-3, was an All-Star candidate in his fourth NBA season, averaging 17.8 points, 5.4 assists, 3.2 turnovers and 1.6 steals in 52 games for Milwaukee. He shot 43.5 percent from the field, 40.9 percent on 3-pointers and 88.1 percent on free throws.\n\nProfile: Brandon Knight\n\nWhen Dragic asked for the Suns to trade him before the February deadline, the Suns dealt Dragic to Miami and replaced him with Knight in a three-team trade that involved Philadelphia. Dragic, 29, reportedly agreed to a five-year, $90 million deal with Miami.\n\nMORE: Suns' target DeMarre Carroll agrees to contract with Raptors\n\nIn 11 games with Phoenix, Knight averaged 13.4 points, 4.5 assists, 2.1 turnovers and 0.5 steals with 35.7 percent field goal shooting, 31.3 percent on 3s and 82.8 percent on free throws. However, the Suns remained impressed with his potential when healthy, his work ethic and his maturity to be a future leader."
