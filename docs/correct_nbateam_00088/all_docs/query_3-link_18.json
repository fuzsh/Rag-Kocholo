        "text": "At times it’s been as if Tyson Chandler never left, as if his three-year absence was just a nightmare somehow shared by all Mavericks fans.\n\nHis 31 double-doubles, his lionesque lording of the painted area and crowd-imploring roars have been reminiscent of his inspired play during Dallas’ NBA championship run.\n\nAlas, this isn’t 2011 anymore. An erratic regular season relegated the Mavericks to a No. 7 playoff seed, a slot from which teams have mustered five series wins in 62 attempts.\n\nThen again, aren’t challenges like No. 2 seed Houston the reason Dallas brought Chandler back last summer? Does anyone who saw Chandler swat away Golden State forward Marreese Speights’ shoe believe he won’t challenge MVP candidate James Harden at the rim and bow up to Dwight Howard?\n\nThis season began with a palpable “Tyson’s back!” buzz. Despite the roller coaster regular season, to many fans the 7-1, 245-pound Chandler still represents hope, however seemingly slim.\n\n\"I can't say enough about the fans,\" Chandler said. \"The support I've received coming back, throughout the community and just stepping on the court, has been truly unbelievable.\n\n“I feel thankful every time someone comes up and thanks me for the part I played in our championship — and everything I bring to the team.”\n\nAfter averaging double-figure points and rebounds in each of the season’s first four months, Chandler saw his numbers dip considerably after a Feb. 24 hip injury. But evidenced by his 13.1-point, 12.7-rebound April averages, he is healthy and primed for a strong playoff push.\n\nJust as in 2011, though, Chandler is among several Mavericks who are in the final year of their contracts. Is it possible that the most impactful and popular center in Mavericks history could have his career here confined to two bookend seasons three years apart?\n\n“I’m trying, honestly, not to look so far in advance and just appreciate the moment, every time I step on the court,” Chandler said. “Whenever my last game here will be, I don’t know. My time here, long term or short term, I’m going to appreciate it.\"\n\nAlways there with an assist\n\nThis is 32-year-old Chandler’s 14th NBA season. He’s played for five franchises, including Dallas twice. He’s played in six home cities, counting Oklahoma City, where the New Orleans franchise temporarily relocated after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nNaturally, Chandler and his wife, Kimberly, would love for him to finish his career in Dallas, especially now that two of their three children are school-aged. Sacha-Marie is 8, Tyson II is 6 and Sayge is 4.\n\nNot that Tyson and Kimberly are complaining. At each of Tyson’s NBA stops, the Chandlers try to immerse themselves in that city, largely through philanthropic efforts.\n\n“Whatever community he’s playing in, for however long that period of time is, that’s the community we like to focus on,” Kimberly said.\n\nIt’s a team endeavor that began in 2001, almost immediately after 18-year-old Tyson signed his rookie contract with the Bulls, shortly after jumping straight from Dominguez High in Compton, Calif., to the No. 2 overall NBA draft pick.\n\nThanksgiving and Christmas charitable events became annual Chandler family staples, with Kimberly’s parents and Tyson’s mother, Vernie Threadgill, usually flying in from California to assist.\n\nAfter Katrina, the Chandlers enlisted help from other New Orleans players and wives to provide household items to families. When superstorm Sandy wreaked devastation in 2012, a few days before the start of Tyson’s second season with the Knicks, the Chandlers organized a similar donation effort in Queens’ Rockaway neighborhood.\n\nThe Chandlers’ return to Dallas and the city’s causes proved as seamless as Tyson’s slipping back on his No. 6 Mavericks jersey.\n\nAs part of an NBA Cares initiative, the Chandlers led a group of Mavericks players, wives, Mavs Dancers and ManiAACs in serving meals to single-parent families at Vogel Alcove. At Christmas, the Chandlers treated six single-parent families to a shopping spree at a Target near Love Field.\n\nAs usual, the Chandler children participated in both holiday efforts.\n\n“I want my children to understand how blessed and fortunate they are. They need to see what reality is for the world,” Tyson said.\n\n“Serving and graciousness and humility are things we’ve always felt were important to instill in our children,” Kimberly said.\n\nLearning responsibility\n\nChandler said his social consciousness no doubt comes from his upbringing.\n\nVernie Threadgill raised Tyson, sister Erica (who played basketball at Pepperdine) and three brothers as a single parent — with help from her parents and siblings, initially on their family farm in Hanford, Calif.\n\nVernie credits her father, Cleotis, for instilling in young Tyson Cleotis Chandler “how to be a gentleman and respect people.”\n\nIt also was Cleotis who also nailed a peach basket to a tree, giving young Tyson a literal and metaphoric basketball goal between slopping pigs, milking cows and cultivating crops.\n\nTyson grew to 6 feet at age 9 and would sprout to 6-10 by eighth grade. In between, wanting to improve her family’s financial outlook, Vernie moved off the farm, beginning an odyssey that resulted in Tyson’s attending an estimated six elementary schools because his mother was always in search of better employment.\n\nOften, mother and son had to have frank discussions about apartment rent, bills, clothes, food.\n\n“She’d say, ‘I want you to know there are certain things you can’t have that I know that you want, that other kids have,’” Tyson recalled. “‘I want you to know it’s not because I don’t love you.’\n\n“Those conversations kind of woke me up at an early age.”\n\nHis burgeoning basketball skills eventually led him to transfer from San Bernardino more than an hour away to tradition-steeped Dominguez, with CBS' 60 Minutes profiling then 14-year-old Tyson as part of a story about the rising influence of AAU coaches and shoe companies and the potential trappings of being a young sports star.\n\nIn many respects, Chandler was the national high school celebrity prequel to the mania that accompanied LeBron James’ 2003 senior season in Akron, Ohio.\n\nAmid his own chaos, which thankfully for him predated social media, Chandler realized he needed to work harder at separating what he calls his two personas: “the character that basketball created and the person I actually am.”\n\n“I had to mature fast and be wise beyond my years if I wanted to keep a level head,” he said. “If I wanted success, I couldn’t get caught up in that mess.”\n\nDuring his junior year, shortly before his 17th birthday, a mutual friend introduced him to Kimberly, a senior at Esperanza, across town in Orange County.\n\n“He’s literally at 32 that same guy I met when he was 16 turning 17,” Kimberly said.\n\nShe said her parents quickly were drawn to an aura Tyson had about him — not the basketball kind.\n\n“It was his sense of responsibility,” she said.\n\nChandler thought he knew everything about his path to the NBA and adulthood, but his return to Dallas produced an epiphany last Nov. 20.\n\nAs he drove to the Thanksgiving event at Vogel Alcove, he phoned Vernie. She’d had a schedule conflict and couldn’t make it to Dallas.\n\nShe told Tyson how fortunate he is to be in a position to help others. She reminded him that for several years, when he was 10 to 12 years old, she’d gotten his Christmas present from an Orange County giveaway program called Santa’s Christmas Shop.\n\nVernie assumed she had confessed years ago that she hadn’t paid for that annual present she’d wrapped and placed under the tree. Tyson’s long silence told Vernie that, in fact, he hadn’t known or remembered.\n\n“Me and her just had a moment together,” Chandler said. “Here I was, on my way to help serve Thanksgiving meals, realizing that about 20 years ago the roles were reversed.”\n\nAsked during a phone interview to recount that conversation with Tyson, Vernie began to speak, but her voice cracked.\n\n“Oh my goodness; this is emotional,” she said. Her words came somewhat more easily when asked how she feels about the way Tyson has been embraced by Dallas fans.\n\n“As a mom, I’m somewhat overwhelmed with it because he is such a nice, warm child,” she said. “It’s a joy to have people come up to me and say, ‘You raised such a wonderful son.’”\n\nGiving back\n\nThe Mavericks’ decision after the championship season not to extend long-term contract offers to Chandler and several other key members of the team stunned Chandler.\n\n\"I was certain I would be back, and things didn't turn out that way,\" he said. \"That's why I'm not getting caught up in [wondering] now.\"\n\nHis three years in New York certainly had positives, not the least of which was the four-year, $60 million contract the Knicks gave him.\n\nHe was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2012. That summer he played on the United States’ Olympic team in London.\n\nThe gold-medal-game victory over Spain occurred on the night of Aug. 12. At 7 the next morning, Tyson, Kimberly, Vernie, Kimberly’s parents and brother headed for the airport and a flight to Africa.\n\nUNICEF had asked Tyson to become the first NBA player to be a national spokesperson for the organization. Chandler said he would consider it, but only after seeing UNICEF’s work first-hand.\n\nEntrusting a friend to bring home his gold medal, Chandler and his family spent two weeks traveling through Tanzania, primarily to facilities that assist homeless children and single mothers with AIDS.\n\n“How many guys give up the glory of going home with a gold medal on their neck to go help kids who don’t even know who they are?” asked UNICEF president and CEO Caryl Stern, who accompanied the Chandlers through Africa.\n\n“He was amazing,” Stern added. “He helped deliver supplies, he was down on the ground, talking to kids about why they need an education. There is nothing prima donna about this guy.”\n\nThree weeks ago, Stern and the Chandlers reunited at Dallas’ Esperanza Hope Medrano Elementary.\n\nThey were there to announce the participation of 11 Dallas schools and two youth centers in what will become a nationwide UNICEF initiative.\n\nStudents wear Kid Power bands that monitor their physical activity. Each mile they collectively compile raises funds to provide ready-to-use therapeutic food packets that are distributed to malnourished children around the world.\n\nIn Dallas, the UNICEF program is partnering with Mayor Mike Rawlings’ 4-year-old Youth Fitness Initiative.\n\n“Tyson’s my man,” Rawlings said. “He’s my favorite, the big guy underneath the rim. Those nine months he was here before took our game to the next level.”\n\nSpeaking personally, but also in a way for the city, Rawlings added, “I sure hope we re-sign him.”\n\nThat was a day off for the Mavericks. They had lost the previous night at Indiana. To a packed auditorium of kids hanging on his every word, Chandler thanked the kids for giving him perspective.\n\n“This reminds me of what life is all about,” he told them. “Last night, tough loss, but then you come here and you see kids who are actually making a difference. I want you to understand that what you are doing is actually saving lives.\n\n“When I’m on the basketball court, I might give you guys a moment to turn on the TV and enjoy and experience something, but it’s not saving anyone’s life.”"
