        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have been a bit of a mess this season. After LeBron James made his decision to join a young, but talented Lakers squad, the world lost its mind. The best player in the world was bringing the spotlight back to Hollywood.\n\nBut things haven’t gone according to plan for Magic Johnson in LA. With the Lakers holding at 5–6, questions have started swirling this organization. There’s much speculation as to what’s wrong with the Lakers, but the addition of veteran C Tyson Chandler may have a bigger impact than you realize.\n\nIf You Remember Tyson Chandler\n\nTyson Chandler was drafted 2nd overall in 2001 with sky-high expectations. Propestourly touted as the “next Kevin Garnett,” Chandler never came close to that. Chandler did, however, come in with towering size at 7’1” 240 lbs with insane athleticism. Though he never capitalized on physical intangibles, Chandler went on to have a very solid career.\n\nChandler was an anchor on defense, Tyson Chandler was basically Rudy Gobert in his prime. Although not the prodigious shot blocker Gobert was, Chandler was still a solid shot blocker and an elite rebounder. Chandler’s biggest asset has been his rebounding, a career per 36 minutes average of 11.3 RPG.\n\nMost of Chandler’s offensive game is near the paint. A rim runner who is a staple part of any team’s P&R game, Chandler shot a career average of 59.6 FG%, including one season of a career-high 64.7 FG%. Chandler’s biggest impact has been on defense and on the boards.\n\nAs Chandler hit his twilight years, he’s still remained an effective player. After running on fumes the last few seasons for the Suns, Phoenix decided to draft DeAndre Ayton as their center of the future. This made Chandler expendable and Phoenix proceeded to buyout Tyson Chandler on November 4th.\n\nTurmoil In LA\n\nThere were set to be growing pains when this team came together, but nobody expected the Lakers to struggle like this. Coming in at 5–6 has the Lakers’ president of basketball operations Magic Johnson calling out head coach Luke Walton.\n\nIt’s not all on Walton however, the Lakers need time to come together. The Lakers have been playing atrocious defense. The Lakers are ranked 23rd in defensive rating, they’re simply not communicating and helping out on defense. This is a team with tremendous individual defenders, they just haven’t come together on that side of the ball.\n\nThe Lakers have been putting up a lot of points, mostly due to their pace, but they still rank 9th in offensive rating. For all the offensive stars on this team, LeBron, Ingram, Kuzma, you would expect that number to be even higher. The Lakers have looked good at times, but errant passes and lack of chemistry have limited this team from reaching their full potential.\n\nThose are simple, fundamental issues that will be solved with time. As the Lakers spend more time together, they will learn to play better as a team. This is a very talented team, but the key cog that is keeping them afloat is the presence of C JaVale McGee.\n\nMcGee has been spectacular on offense, averaging a career-high 14.5 PPG along with fantastic averages of 63.1 FG% and 7.2 RPG. McGee has been a perfect fit for this offense, his prowess in the P&R game as the roller is fantastic. He has been a huge benefactor of playing alongside fantastic passers like Rondo, LeBron, and Ball.\n\nMcGee’s biggest impact comes on defense, however. He’s a versatile help defender and a tenacious shot blocker, averaging a pristine 3.1 BPG in just 26.1 MPG. It’s fair to wonder how bad this defense would be without McGee.\n\nThe one concern for LA is the durability of McGee. They have been hesitant to give McGee 30.0+ MPG with concerns that his body would break down. The Lakers desire small lineups where they can play LeBron or Michael Beasly at the 5, but their defense won’t hold up if they do that. So what’s the solution? I’m glad you asked.\n\nIs Chandler The Answer?\n\nAfter Tyson Chandler was signed just a few days ago, he was immediately inserted into the rotation for a Lakers team that has been gushed for the most opposing paint points per game this season. Chandler stepped in and put up 4 points and 8 rebounds (4 offensive) in just 23 minutes of action.\n\nChandler gives the Lakers another big physical big man who will alleviate the pressure of McGee. Chandler is by no means the player McGee is, but at this stage in his career, Chandler is still an elite rebounder and defender.\n\nThe Lakers have actually been a solid defensive team when McGee is on the floor. The moment you take him off, the Lakers just fall apart. Adding Chandler on this team will give the Lakers a lot of the same tough, physical presence and defense that McGee gives you.\n\nAfter 11 games, NBA fans are claiming that the Lakers need another star to even compete in this league, but it’s the little things that will make this team reach their elite potential. Tyson Chandler may not be a flashy name, but he is a solid player who will make a serious impact on a team looking for an identity."
