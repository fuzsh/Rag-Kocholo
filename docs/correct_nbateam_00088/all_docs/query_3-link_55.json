        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA tough, elite defensive true center: uses his huge wingspan, great size, and superb quickness to dominate as a rebounder and man-to-man stopper. Mobile at over seven feet, with the agility of a small forward; can both run the floor and post up. Has good hands and timing for alley-oops. Hits for a very high field-goal percentage. Despite his defensive dominance he is not quite the shot-blocker he can be. Somewhat limited offensively, especially in creating his own shot in the post. An average free-throw shooter. Has struggled with injuries throughout his career in the NBA (and age is certainly not helping the matter)."
