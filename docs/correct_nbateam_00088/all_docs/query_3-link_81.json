        "text": "It was a typical training camp scrimmage for the Suns - until Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson got a little too physical with one another. There was some holding and grabbing and then they fell to the floor together, Jackson lying on top of Chriss.\n\nEmotions boiled over. Words were exchanged. Practice was stopped.\n\nThe players gathered at midcourt but it wasn’t coach Earl Watson who spoke to them. It was veteran center Tyson Chandler.\n\nThe same scene was repeated a week later when a player complained about a call during practice. Practice was halted. The players gathered in a circle. Chandler, his voice loud enough so everyone watching could hear, talked to his teammates about trust.\n\n“Sometimes a coach can say only so much,” Watson said. “It takes that accountability from within to move forward.”\n\nAt 35, Chandler is the outlier to the Suns’ youth movement. Think of it this way: Chandler is starting his 17th season in the NBA; Dragan Bender has been on the planet 19 years.\n\n“Yeah, I’m the old guy,” Chandler said.\n\nChandler’s value to the Suns is unmistakable, though. Before the Suns sat him down the final 25 games of last season he averaged 8.4 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. Had Chandler played enough games he would have ranked eighth in the league in rebounding.\n\nBut it’s his leadership that truly defines his worth. Chandler – as well as forward Jared Dudley – are the voices the young Suns listen to, the voices that teach, encourage and hold them accountable.\n\n“I think he and Jared Dudley are remarkable as far as the experience they have,” Watson said. “I get on (the players) as much as possible and then it’s like a feel thing. I’ll feel it’s time for them to get on one another and I’ll let Tyson get in on that discussion.”\n\nChandler said being a leader has become “extremely natural” for him the past seven or eight years as he got older and the rest of the NBA got younger.\n\n“I feel like I’ve been a leader but you find your voice later on in your career,” he said. “Now I’m in a place where I’m the elder statesman. I feel it’s my duty to stand up and say something. And it’s more important for the players to police themselves than the coach.\n\n“You want to hear it from somebody that’s right next to you. I feel like it means a little more. Coach can hold the team accountable but it’s more important that we hold each other accountable. That’s when you take it to the next level. It can’t just be the coach constantly having to get guys going.”\n\nIt’s not easy for Chandler, winding down his career on a team that won just 24 games last season and likely is at least two years away from making the playoffs. But he understands that his leadership is even more valuable during down times. It’s why he “pushes the hell out of these guys” during practice. It’s why, he said, he practices even harder now than he did four or five years ago.\n\n“When you’re on veteran teams you worry less because you can get back on the court and know you just have to lock things in and you’ll win the next game,” Chandler said. “Whereas young players I almost feel a duty to teach them how to work. I have to set an example.”\n\nIt's the example he learned from his grandfather, Cleo Threadgill, whom he credits for being the biggest influence in his life. Threadgill worked on farms in Hanford, California, and Chandler can recall him getting up at 5 every morning, working 12 to 14 hours without complaint.\n\n“He never felt like he was owed anything. That set a tone in my life,” Chandler said. “He was literally my everything. He set so many examples without even speaking.”\n\nOne of those examples: Don’t rely on others what you can do yourself.\n\n“I’m a light sleeper now because when I lived with my grandfather I would wait for his feet to hit the ground and I would pop up because he said only if I’m up would he let me go to work with him,” Chandler said. “I would beg him and he’d say, ‘I’m not going to wake you up. You have to wake yourself up.’\n\n“It taught me at a young age to do things on your own, be responsible, have a work ethic.”\n\nChandler is now passing those lessons on to the Suns.\n\n“He looks after me like one of his little brothers,” Chriss said. “When I first came to this team he took me under his wing and helped me learn a lot. He’s trying to teach me things he learned later on in his career. It’s helped a lot.”"
