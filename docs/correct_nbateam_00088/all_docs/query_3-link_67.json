        "text": "Los Angeles native Tyson Chandler is on the verge of signing a contract with the Lakers after being placed on waivers by the Phoenix Suns.\n\nAfter a contract buyout freed Chandler from the final year of his contract with the Suns, he targeted his hometown team.\n\n\"We love the fact that we're going to get another veteran,\" Lakers star LeBron James said Saturday night. \"A guy who plays hard, a guy who's very smart and another champion to add to the champions that we have in this system here today, and it adds depth in our frontcourt, which we have had trouble with at times.\"\n\nThe Suns officially announced the buyout on Sunday. \"We want to thank Tyson for his contributions to the Suns over the past three-plus seasons,\" vice president of basketball operations James Jones said in a statement.\n\n\"With respect for Tyson's accomplished career, today's move gives him the chance to pursue a new opportunity while allowing our younger players to continue developing. Tyson is a consummate professional and we wish him all the best.\"\n\nChandler's playing time was diminished this season due to the presence of standout rookie center Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\n\"I am grateful for my time in Phoenix and want to thank my teammates, my coaches, the front office and the fans for an amazing experience,\" Chandler said in a statement. \"I wish them the best and I am excited for the next stage in my career.\"\n\nChandler, 36, is in his 18th season, and was slated to make $13.6 million this season in the final campaign of a four-year contract with Phoenix.\n\nSky Sports is the new home of the NBA in the UK with live coverage throughout the week, including selected live games free to all Sky subscribers via Sky Sports Mix."
