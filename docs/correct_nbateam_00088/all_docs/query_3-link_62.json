        "text": "When they stand next to each other, a frequent occurrence these past three months, Tyson Chandler and Dereck Lively II literally see eye-to-eye and uncannily close to mirror-image.\n\nMavericks great Chandler, 41, stands 7 feet and remains close to his playing weight of 235 pounds. Mavs rookie Lively, 19, stands 7-1 and officially is listed at 234 pounds.\n\nMentor Chandler is a West Coast millennial; pupil Lively is an East Coast Gen Z. Fortunately for the Dallas franchise, though, these similarly cerebral giants have had an ESP-like connection almost from the moment the Mavericks acquired No. 12 pick Lively on draft night, June 22.\n\n“It’s a breath of fresh air; something I didn’t expect,” Chandler said. “He’s like a little brother. A little brother I didn’t know I had.”\n\nNo doubt that is a pleasing assessment for Mavericks fans who have longed for a rim-protecting franchise center since Chandler’s regrettably brief Mavericks stints of 2010-11 and 2014-15.\n\nNot that MFFLs should get ahead of themselves by expecting Lively to be an immediate savior, even as coach Jason Kidd projects that he’ll be the season-opening starting center Oct. 25 at San Antonio.\n\nSpend a few minutes speaking with Lively or watching him on the court and it’s striking how advanced he is — for his age. By NBA standards he’s raw. Chandler, remember, was 28 when the Mavericks acquired him before their 2010-11 NBA championship season.\n\nBy then Chandler was nine seasons into a career that began in choppy waters, for a Chicago team coming off a 15-win season, and with Chandler getting drafted No. 2 overall straight out of Compton’s Dominguez High School.\n\nLike Chandler, Lively was a McDonald’s All-American and a state champion, at Westtown School near Philadelphia. Lively, though, also got to play a season at Duke, averaging 5.4 points and 2.3 blocks in 19 minutes.\n\n“And the difference between him and me is I didn’t come into a team like this,” Chandler said. “He’s coming into a team that’s ready for him, a sound organization. What he’s coming into is way more stable.”\n\nA big part of that stability is Chandler, who retired in North Texas following his last NBA season, 2019-20, and is beginning his third season as a part-time assistant to Kidd.\n\nTwo seasons ago Chandler primarily worked with Moses Brown and Willie Cauley-Stein, and last season he mostly worked with Christian Wood, but Chandler-Lively seemingly is a consummate pairing in every way.\n\n“I’m grateful,” Lively said. “It’s kind of funny that we’re built the same. We both are tatted on the right arm [and] tatted on the left leg.\n\n“At first I wasn’t really familiar with Tyson’s game, until I started to do my homework. Then I realized, ‘Wow, we really do play the same.’ We have the same demeanor. He’s 40-something and he has the same energy as me. We kind of reflect off of one another, you know?”\n\n‘He’s not running from it’\n\nMinutes after the Mavericks acquired Lively’s rights, Mavericks vice president of basketball operations Michael Finley said that Lively during pre-draft workouts “reminded me of a younger Tyson Chandler.”\n\nFinley emphasized that he wasn’t strictly comparing the players and didn’t want to put pressure on Lively, but, rather, he viewed him as having potential to someday become a Chandler-caliber player.\n\nBeing mentioned in the same breath as Chandler didn’t seem to bother Lively that night, nor since.\n\n“He’s not running from it; not at all,” Chandler said. “My goal, though, is not to make him the player I was; I want him to be a better player than I was.\n\n“Not that I’m trying to put that pressure on him in any kind of way. I’m not trying to put that out there for him to live up to anything. I think he’s a special player in his own right. I’m just trying to give him every tool that I learned along the way — earlier than I got.”\n\nThrough three overseas preseason games — two against Minnesota in Abu Dhabi and one in Spain against Real Madrid — Lively has modest averages of 3.3 points, 5.0 rebounds and 19 minutes.\n\nRelated:Who will start for the Mavericks? Early signs indicate at least one, perhaps both rookies\n\nThose numbers, however, are as meaningless as Dallas’ 0-3 record. At this stage of Lively’s development, progress is best assessed by how quickly he’s grasping the offensive and defensive systems.\n\nAnd by exceptional moments, such as the second quarter of last Saturday’s game against Minnesota, when as a help defender he deftly blocked Troy Brown Jr.’s driving layup; and the third quarter, when he came from nowhere and swatted Kyle Anderson’s floater into the stands.\n\nLively is averaging two blocks in limited court time, but even more promising is how often he’s altered shots or forced penetrating opponents to pass to the perimeter.\n\nAnother important intangible that Lively has in common with Chandler: He is vocal on defense, calling out warnings and keeping teammates tied together.\n\n“It’s gonna be hard with the packed stadium, but you guys [reporters] are probably going to hear my voice whenever you’re on the sideline,” Lively said.\n\nProfessor Chandler has been impressed by how quickly Lively is learning other nuances, including pick-and-roll coverages.\n\n“Being a big is tough because it’s like being a point guard,” Chandler said. “You’ve got to manage everything, especially defensively. You see everything that comes in front of you.\n\n“Most of the young bigs don’t talk. It’s hard to get younger bigs to talk. But he’s pretty vocal for a young guy.”\n\nStudent and teacher\n\nScoring will not be a priority for Lively this season, but the Mavericks cannot afford for him to be an offensive liability.\n\nHe needs to be a solid screener and adept at rolling to the basket at the optimal time and angle to catch lobs from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. When smaller defenders switch onto him he needs to punish them down low, if not with his frame then with his 7-foot-7 wingspan and leaping ability.\n\n“He’s savvy down there when he catches the ball,” Chandler said. “He’s not rushed. He’s getting into his moves, shooting his hooks.\n\n“A lot of times young players get down there and turn the ball over because they’re moving too fast. He’s getting down there comfortably, seeing what he’s supposed to be looking at, deciphering when to get rid of the ball or go make a play.\n\n“That all happens so fast, it normally takes a little while to learn. But he’s picking it up, I would say, faster than anybody I’ve seen at his age.”\n\nChandler is far from alone in that assessment. Mavericks players and coaches, almost to a man, have remarked about Lively’s head-turning play and willingness to listen.\n\nPick-and-roll coverage will be an ongoing challenge because over the course of an 82-game season, opponents will throw myriad plays and variations at the rookie.\n\n“I think he has the right mentality to pick it up very quickly, quicker than most bigs, with his with his motor, with his athleticism, with his ability to move his feet,” incumbent starting center Dwight Powell said. “But most of all, with his mind. He’s hungry to learn.”\n\nThe Mavericks returned Wednesday from their 12-day, 16,500-mile trek, the longest in NBA preseason history. They aren’t scheduled to resume training camp until Monday.\n\nWhile much of the attention is leading to the season opener in San Antonio and beyond will be on the ability of Doncic and Irving to gel, perhaps the Mavericks’ second-most important dynamic will be the Lively-Chandler relationship.\n\nThe 41-year-old teacher and 19-year-old student. The best center in Mavericks history and the franchise’s current and future hope.\n\nLively said it’s been comforting, and constructive, to have Chandler as a constant presence, whether during and after practices or in film sessions.\n\n“He’s always there to have something to say, whether it’s telling me when I’ve done something right, or telling me how I can correct myself,” Lively said. “He’s always telling me not just what I want to hear, but what I need to hear.”"
