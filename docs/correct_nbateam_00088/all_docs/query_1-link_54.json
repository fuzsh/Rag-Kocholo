        "text": "NBA fashion gets more out there with every passing year, whether it be Russell Westbrook bold printed shirts or the Miami Heat's embrace of pastel-color pants. The days of 17-button suits are over, at least among everyone who doesn't have a job analyzing games on NBA TV. The fashionista movement has gone so far that now players even argue about who started certain trends.\n\n[Adrian Wojnarowski: NBA hoping to generate more revenue with World Cup of Basketball proposal]\n\nYet there are still many unexplored territories of NBA fashion. The way things are going, though, it seems likely that we'll reach them eventually. For proof, just know that New York Knicks center and Defensive Player of the Year Tyson Chandler owns and wears several capes. From Women's Wear Daily, as related by Jian DeLeon at Complex (via TBJ):\n\n\"Probably the most dramatic pieces in my wardrobe would be capes,\" the center reportedly said. \"I wouldn't consider myself Goth, but I love Gothic pieces,\" he continued.\n\nThe article describes Chandler's off-the-court demeanor as an \"art-loving hipster with a beard and a passion for photography and friends.\" No stranger to style, Chandler probably feels comfortable exploring different types of fashions with teammates like Amar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony also making regular appearances at fashion shows and stylish ceremonies like the Met Gala.\n\nChander likes that New York has a lot of different types of clothes for sale, whether it's dark designers or high-end tailoring. \"When I'm in other cities, you can't just pop up at Rick Owens….You can't just go down to Tom Ford,\" he said.\n\nIt's likely that capes would be the most dramatic pieces in any wardrobe, seeing that they're most associated with crimefighters, 19th-century British men, and, as Trey Kerby photoshopped at TBJ, Frank Costanza's lawyer. They're not exactly subtle, nor is there a clear social situation for them. Unless Tyson Chandler works as a high school drama tech on the side, that is.\n\nIt's enough to make you wonder where NBA players are headed after capes. Will Dwyane Wade wear a monocle or use opera glasses to identify reporters after a game? Might Kevin Durant opt for a suit of chainmail? Could Nick Young wear the robes of a Hare Krishna?\n\nThese are difficult questions that I'm not able to answer. The way things are going, we'll probably get answers soon enough."
