        "text": "The Knicks have made many moves this off-season to become a contender in the Eastern Conference. The expectations are higher than they have ever been as the Knicks seek their first title in over thirty years. The way I see it, the Knicks still have more moves to make if they want to compete with the Miami Heat. Lets compare the projected starting lineups.\n\nNew York Knicks Miami Heat\n\nRaymond Felton Mario Chalmers\n\nJR Smith Dwyane Wade\n\nCarmelo Anthony LeBron James\n\nAmare Stoudemire Shane Battier\n\nTyson Chandler Chris Bosh\n\nA lot of this season will depend on how well Amare Stoudemire can play. We all know that Melo will be the same guy he was for the United States Olympic team and that Tyson Chandler will continue to be a powerhouse defender. But there are many questions surrounding Amare who had an injury plagued season in 2011 and has not been able to prove that he can play with Carmelo Anthony. This is the make or break season for Stoudemire. He averaged eight less points last season than in the 2010-11 season. STAT needs to turn that STAT around and start hitting his jump shot if the Knicks have any chance of making a playoff run.\n\nAnd what about the point guard position? For a while, New Yorkers believed that Steve Nash would be the starting point guard. Then it was Jeremy Lin. Fans thought there was no way that management would let the big hit Linsanity leave New York City. They were wrong. Raymond Felton is the starting point guard with Jason Kidd backing him up.\n\nFelton is 28 years old and has the potential to be a great distributor on the court. When he played with the Knicks in 2010, he had career highs with 17 points and 9 assists per game. Since then, his numbers have decreased but unfortunately his weight has increased. He was definitely looking a little chubby last season in Portland.\n\nBut if Felton can get back into shape and start nailing his jump shot, the release of Jeremy Lin will not seem as crazy as most people thought. Lin struggles with turnovers way more than Felton and Raymond’s pick and roll style meshes quite well with Stoudemire according to the 2010-11 season. Felton could actually be a good fit for this team.\n\nThe problem for the Knicks is depth and three-point shooting. It’s not so much that the Knicks lack depth, but the Heat are just an incredibly deep team. The best three-point shooter in the history of the National Basketball Association is the BACK-UP shooting guard for the Heat. Ray Allen was part of the big 3 for the Celtics and yet now he is coming off the bench for Miami! Udonis Haslem is the second string power forward even though he would start for most teams in the NBA. He is a great rebounder and defender making him a great asset to have off the bench. Proven sophomore point guard Norris Cole will chip in some minutes for the much-improved Chalmers. And the Heat were able to bring in another veteran three-point shooter in Rashard Lewis.\n\nWith so many lights out shooters on this team (including Mike Miller if he is healthy), they will be almost impossible to defend. Every time Wade or LeBron drives to the lane, one of these guys will be wide open for the three. The Knicks do not have enough firepower to keep up with the Miami Heat if they do not make a few tweaks.\n\nNew York does have a great back-up center in Marcus Camby but until Iman Shumpert comes back, the starting five will have to lead this team throughout the regular season. Jason Kidd will most likely split minutes with Felton and the Knicks best shooter Steve Novak will come off the bench. Other than that, this team has a bunch of guys that have no value. The Heat are much deeper and they have better shooters. Not to mention, LeBron James is the best player in the league.\n\nI believe that the Knicks need to make more moves right now. Carmelo and Tyson are in the prime of their career and it is time to surround them with as much talent as possible. I know that is what the organization is trying to do, but I think there are more free agency signings and trades that could be made.\n\nThe Knicks definitely need a solid power forward coming off the bench. Right now they are pursuing Kenyon Martin. If they get him, it is a huge bonus. But if K-Mart decides to sign elsewhere, who will back up the aging Stoudemire? If they could, I would say that New York should trade the former All-Star but I don’t think any team would be willing to take on his lucrative contract. So what should the Knicks do?\n\nThey could sign a guy like Ben Wallace who is an old veteran that can still play solid defense. However, I think having Wallace and Chandler on the floor at the same time would decrease New York’s offensives efficiency substantially. That is why the Knicks need Kenyon Martin or even a guy like Matt Barnes who can play defense and shoot. He is more of a small forward but Carmelo could always move to power forward. Another option is to sign free agent Josh Howard who averaged 20 points in 2007-08. Although his numbers are in a steady decline, he is 32 years old and still has something left in the tank.\n\nThe Knicks are without a doubt a top five team in the Eastern Conference. This year it is crucial for them to shoot for the #2 seed in order to avoid playing the Heat until the Eastern Conference Finals (assuming they make it that far). Iman Shumpert could not come back soon enough and I believe that the Knicks need to go after guys like Kenyon Martin or Matt Barnes if they want be considered a serious contender.\n\nRight now I have the Knicks finishing as the 4th seed but if they make the right moves, who knows what could happen? The regular season is full of unknowns. Maybe some minority bench player who has been cut from multiple teams will come out of nowhere becoming the best player on the team and start an entire movement? Hey, it’s happened before…\n\nThe Knicks have made many moves this off-season to become a contender in the Eastern Conference.

Hey, it’s happened before…\n\nMatt’s Projected Eastern Conference Standings\n\n1. Miami Heat– With the acquisitions of Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis, and the spectacular play by the big three in the playoffs last year, I don’t see anyone coming close to defeating the Heat. Projection: 62-20\n\n2. Boston Celtics– The Celtics lost Ray Allen, however, they also acquired Jason “The Jet” Terry, a leader and great in clutch moments. Avery Bradley seems to be a solid back up shooting guard along with Courtney Lee. The Celtics were also able to re-sign Brandon Baas and Jeff Green. Kevin Garnett re-signed and will mentor the two rookies Jared Sullinger and Fab Melo. And they still have Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, the best playmaker in the league. This team is incredibly deep and should go far. Projection: 56-26\n\n3. Indiana Pacers– Donnie Walsh has returned to the Pacers and I expect this team to build off of last year’s break out season. I actually believe that the Pacers will have a very similar season as last year as they did not make many moves. They re-signed 7’2” Roy Hibbert and added Point Guard, DJ Augistin. Danny Granger should lead this team to another winning season. Projection 50-32\n\n4. New York Knicks– Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler. Arguably, the best front court in the league. With the additions of veterans Jason Kidd, Raymond Felton, Marcus Camby, Kurt Thomas, and Ronnie Brewer, the Knicks will have a huge amount of pressure to go far this year. Knicks fans always say, “This is our year.” Well folks, its now or never. Projection 49-33\n\n5. Chicago Bulls– The only reason that I do not have this team up higher is because Derrick Rose is going to miss at least half the season and there is no way of knowing if he will return 100% healthy. Without D-Rose, the Bulls lost in the first round to the Sixers last year and barely put up a fight. Boozer and Noah are solid, but the Bulls offense runs through Rose, and without him, this team will struggle. Projection: 45- 37\n\n6. Brooklyn Nets– the Nets will make the Playoffs their first year playing in Brooklyn. With Deron Williams, Brook Lopez and Gerald Wallace signing long term contracts, this team is going to be talented for a long time. All-Star Joe Johnson has left Atlanta and has joined Deron and the Nets. With Marshon Brooks off the bench and Kris Humphries at Power Forward, this squad should be very deep and fun to watch. Projection: 44-38\n\n7. Orlando Magic- They may have a lot of controversy, and they may lose Dwight Howard before the trade deadline, but for now, you can’t count them out. Projection: 42-40\n\n8. Atlanta Hawks- Although they lost Joe Johnson and Marvin Williams, they still have Josh Smith and Al Horford. They won’t be as good as last year, but they will still make a push for the Post-Season. Projection: 41-41\n\nEveryone knows that to be considered one of the greatest athletes, you have to win a championship. No matter what sport it is, you will never be a superstar if you have not won it all and proven that your team is the best in the world.\n\nPrime example… LeBron James. LeBron James was/is the most scrutinized player in the history of sports. I used to make jokes about him only having 75 cents because he had no fourth quarter and that I put my phone on Lebron mode during class…Ringless. But all of LeBron’s haters (including myself) must now shut up and give credit where credit is due. He has finally won a ring. He is a champion. And he is one the greatest basketball players to ever play the game… still not as good as MJ though.\n\nSo now that the pressure is off of King James to win a championship, who has that pressure shifted to? Chris Paul, Deron Williams, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard? Those are just a few names that come to mind. But I think the most pressure will be on Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks to win within the next two years.\n\nAnthony can do it all on the offensive end of the court. He can drive, he can pass, he can pull up from the top of the key, and he can drain buckets from beyond the three point line. He has that attack mode instinct in him and he is extremely clutch. Yes, he has been criticized for his lackadaisical defense at times, but when he actually tries and with some coaching, he can be a great defender.\n\nCarmelo is surrounded by talent and arguably has the best frontcourt in the league containing Tyson Chandler, Amare Stoudamire, and Melo himself. The Knicks have made a lot of off-season moves in order to make a title run NOW. They have brought back Raymond Felton to run the point and re-signed J.R. Smith to start at the 2 guard until Iman Shumpert returns from his injury. They have brought in three veterans who know how to win such as J Kidd, Marcus Camby, and Kurt Thomas. This team is built to win NOW.\n\nNo more excuses Melo! You have had enough time to get used to playing with Amare and Tyson. It might take a little bit to get on the same page with Felton, but this is it. This is your chance. You are 28 years old now and in the prime of your career. Win a championship or be just another under achiever in New York City. The pressure is on…"
