The Cavaliers defeated the Suns 101-97. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are at a pivot point in their season and could use the addition of Tyson Chandler.\n\nThroughout the course of his career, Tyson Chandler has been known as a superb rim-protector. Even at 34, he’s continue this stellar reputation. Luckily, the Cleveland Cavaliers need his services.\n\nIn an article that I wrote earlier this month, I went into detail about how the Cavaliers need a shot protector:\n\nMore from King James Gospel\n\nWhile the numbers may have changed a bit, the concept is still the same. The Cleveland Cavaliers need a shot-blocker. While many of the young shot-blockers of the league like Nerlens Noel may cost the Cavaliers too much, aging veterans like Tyson Chandler would be steals for the Cavaliers.\n\nTyson Chandler, who won Defensive Player of the Year in the 2011-2012 season, was a key part of the Dallas Mavericks championship run in which they beat the LeBron James led Heat during his first season in Miami. Chandler has also made the NBA All-Defensive team three times throughout this career.\n\nIf those aren’t the accolades that makes GM David Griffin move to action, I don’t know what are. While no trade rumors have surrounded Chandler, the 11-25 Suns who are in dead last in the West could easily fall for a trade involving Tyson.\n\nWith that said, let’s take a look at what Tyson’s stock is currently at.\n\nDec 31, 2016; Salt Lake City, UT, USA; Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler (4) reacts to referee Matt Boland (18) during the first half against the Utah Jazz at Vivint Smart Home Arena. Mandatory Credit: Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhat Is Chandler’s Value?\n\nThis season, Chandler has averaged 7.7 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. His rebounding average is fourth-most in his career. For a 34-year-old, his minutes are high as well as he averages 27.3 minutes per game.\n\nWhile Chandler does shoot an alluring 68.8 percent from the field, his offense is usually overlooked. His defense is why Chandler has made a living in the NBA. Even though he is not a big-time shot-blocker, Chandler’s physical presence at 7-foot-1 is the key reason that he is such a crucial target. Even during his DPOY campaign in 2012, Chandler only averaged 1.4 blocks per game.\n\nThe big man also snags down 2.3 contested offense rebounds per game which would help the Cavalier’s 85.3 shots per game which is 18th in the NBA.\n\nStats alone are not the reason that Chandler would be an easy target. The position of the Suns is the key factor. The Suns, like they have been the past several years, are nowhere near the playoffs. The Suns currently also have two young power forwards in Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss and one young center in Alex Len.\n\nThis puts them at a crossroads where a trade for an aging veteran becomes an imminent decision, and they need to made the right decision.\n\nDec 7, 2016; Phoenix, AZ, USA; NBA referee Ken Mauer and Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler (4) against the Indiana Pacers at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Pacers defeated the Suns 109-94. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Trade\n\nCavaliers get C, Tyson Chandler\n\nAccording to the ESPN trade machine, the straight up swap for a much younger Iman Shumpert does not just work due to Chandler’s high salary.\n\nCavalier fans must remember that they have four trade exceptions that they can use. The Anderson Varejao exception is worth $9.64 million. This would be enough to allow this trade to go through and give Phoenix a bit more of an incentive.\n\nThis trade would therefore work, and it would allow each team to improve. The Suns could clear a front court logjam, and it would allow the Cavaliers a useful big. With the coming onto the seen of Jordan McRae, the Cavaliers could use him as the main PG/SG off of the bench.\n\nJan 3, 2017; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) and center Tyson Chandler (4) talk on the court in the first half of the NBA game against the Miami Heat at Talking Stick Resort Arena. Mandatory Credit: Jennifer Stewart-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Suns New Look\n\nWith Iman Shumpert now on the Phoenix Suns, they would most likely be looking to play him at the small forward position- a position that Shump plays only 5% of the time. It would also allow the Suns to put P.J. Tucker on the trading block.\n\nTucker, who could be crucial to a playoff contender, could be traded just as Kyle Korver was recently traded. Along with accepting an offer for Tucker, the Suns could move Dragan Bender to center behind Len.\n\nThe fit could also work for the Suns since they have Eric Bledsoe, a drive-heavy point guard. His athleticism could open up the floor for Shumpert who would come on and be the Suns third-best three-point threat.\n\nThis could be an upgrade for the Suns, and it would certainly be worth checking into if general manager David Griffin called. Griffin has been active, and sources say that this is just the beginning of the Cavaliers domino effect of trades.\n\nMar 10, 2015; Dallas, TX, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) drives against Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler (6) at American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New Look Cavaliers\n\nThis trade would be big for the Cavaliers especially after the acquisition of Kyle Korver.\n\nChandler would play behind Thompson.\n\nChanning Frye would slide to the backup power forward spot and James would most likely see a reduction in his power forward play, where he’s played 27 percent of his minutes. The Cavaliers may then try to trade for a backup point guard or sign a player like Mario Chalmers or Norris Cole.\n\nThis would certainly give the Cavaliers a new dimension for them to attack their opponents. If you add this along with a point guard to the Cleveland Cavaliers, they could easily be the favorite not only in the East but also in the entire NBA.\n\nThis is the second move in this domino effect. The Cavaliers would benefit greatly from the addition of Chandler, and it could be possible for them to snag him for even less than a rotational player in Shumpert.\n\nDo you think this is a good trade? If not, tell us at KJG, and we will discussion how this Cavaliers team can improve even more."
