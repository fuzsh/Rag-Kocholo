Now Tyson has been nominated for the NBA’s 2013 Community Assist Award, which honors the NBA player who best reflects the passion that the league and its players have for giving back to the global community. The winning player receives a $25,000 donation to the charity of his choice. Tyson has designated the U.S. Fund for UNICEF as his charity. A fan vote determines the winner, so we need your help!\n\n© UNICEF/Paul Joynson-Hicks"
