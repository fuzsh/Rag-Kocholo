        "text": "Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Creativity in Innovation - ECCI 2022 (9-10 November 2022) - https://books.aijr.org/index.php/press/catalog/book/154. In our analysis, we would like to expose some ideas on creativity, promotion of creativity and destruction of creativity. Our general intent is to show that creativity is not reserved for geniuses but, on the contrary, belongs to all individuals. Moreover, we aim to describe how creativity can be promoted in individuals in different ages of their life. Finally, we wish to expose that creativity is a disposition which always needs to be cultivated with all possible care: for creativity can be easily damaged or even destroyed because of a false education of the individuals or due to negatively organised work environments. For our investigation, we shall take elements from different sources: we shall analyse ideas expressed in the works of Teresa Amabile, we shall consider the criticism of traditional pedagogy exposed in the meditation of Paulo Freire, we shall propose some examples of the black – namely the poisonous – pedagogy contained in the work of Katharina Rutschky, we shall present Alice Miller’s criticism of determined models of education, and we shall the inquiry into the concept of innovation exposed in the research of Tina Seelig. The works of Teresa Amabile will show that creativity is a faculty which belongs to all individuals, not only to the most endowed ones. Amabile shows in her book different examples of the ways in which creativity and motivation are improved both in schools and in companies; she analyses how, on the contrary, creativity and motivation are damaged and destroyed in schools and in companies. With the help of Amabile’s inquiries, we shall show the importance of making progress in the work both in schools and in the work environments: people and their progress ought always to be supported in order that the disposition to creativity can function. People always need positive consideration in schools and in work environments. Rutschky’s analysis of the poisonous pedagogy will show us how certain methods of education lead to the destruction of any creativity whatsoever and of the whole personality of the individual. Alice Miller’s works will give further examples regarding the destruction of autonomy through traditional methods of education. Thanks to Paulo Freire’s meditation we shall see how creativity depends on the models of society: in particular, concepts like the bank account of education and internalisation can teach us how the individuals in the schools are transformed into a completely passive audience, thus losing any capacity whatsoever of proposing innovation in the work and in the society. The structure of society and the aims of society determine the models of schools operating in society. The works of Tina Seelig will finally give us the possibility of seeing the different components needed for the development of creativity: for instance, imagination, knowledge, resources, and culture will prove to be essential components of creativity.
