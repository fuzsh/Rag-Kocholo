The teams compete in groups of four or three teams (League C). The eight best teams in League A (first and second places) immediately go to the final tournament. There they join the host country, Switzerland.\n\nThe remaining seven passes are to be played in two rounds of playoffs. In the one-way first round, the third- and fourth-placed teams in League A face the group winners and the top three second-placed teams in League C. The eight winners advance to the second round.\n\nElsewhere, the four group winners and the top two runners-up in League B play the remaining two runners-up and the four third-placed teams in League B. The six winners advance to the second round.\n\nIn the second round of the playoffs, 14 national teams directly play for seven tickets to the final tournament of EURO 2025, where a total of 16 participants play.\n\nThe paths of the teams in the play-off matches are to be adjusted, if necessary, taking into account the performances of Switzerland, which plays in League B, but will be represented at the Euro as the host country.\n\nIf Switzerland finishes first, second, or third in their B League group, the fourth-best team from that division will enter the playoffs.\n\nPromotion and relegation\n\nIn parallel, teams will also compete for positions in the next Nations League, which begins the 2025-2027 cycle:\n\n— winners, holders of second and third places in League A groups will remain in League A;\n\n— the second-place winners and the three best third-place winners in League B groups will remain in League B;\n\n— the winners of the second, third, and fourth places in the groups of League C will remain in League C;\n\n— the winners of the groups in the B and C leagues will move to the higher division;\n\n— the fourth-place finishers in League A and B groups, as well as the worst third-place finisher in League B, will be relegated.\n\nWomen's EURO Qualifiers.
