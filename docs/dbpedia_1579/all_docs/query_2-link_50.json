        "text": "Creativity at the workplace is a process largely affected by social interactions. Social interactions inevitably generate conflict. At the workplace, where people, skills, perceptions, cultures, interests, and goals are not always aligned, conflict becomes a normal and natural process. However, while conflict is a normal part of any social and organizational setting, the challenge lies in how people choose to deal with it. Ignoring it, avoiding or suppressing it undermines team cohesion and productivity, fuels tensions and politics and increases stress and job dissatisfaction. Since organizations cannot avoid conflict, the best way to deal with it is to embrace it. By accepting or even encouraging conflict, leaders set the foundations for creativity, innovation and change. Keywords: conflict, teams, workplace, creativity\n\nPart of managing for innovation is creating the appropriate climate so that people can share and build upon each other&#39;s ideas and suggestions. Yet, there are increasing pressures and potential unproductive levels of tension within organizations. This article points out the distinction between two forms of tension that appear within the research on organizational climates for creativity as well as the conflict management literature. The Debate dimension is described as reflecting a more productive idea tension and the Conflict dimension suggests a more non‚Äêproductive personal tension. A series of studies, across multiple levels of analysis, are summarized and a new study is reported in order to highlight the finding that relatively higher levels of Debate, and lower levels of Conflict are more conducive to organizational creativity and innovation. A practical model for the constructive use of differences is shared, along with a few strategies for reducing the negative tension as...\n\nConflict management is the task where in the aspect of conflict leads to a disagreement between two or more individuals or groups, with each individual or group trying to gain acceptance of its views or objections over others. When employees do not cope-up with the conflict situation, there is an increased absenteeism and exit of employees from the organisation and work. On the other hand it has been opinioned that conflict is good for the organization as it produces new ideas, increases competitive spirit, cohesiveness in the team and instils an atmosphere of brotherhood in the organization. This is only possible if ideas are properly channelized and there is proper delegation of authority, empowerment and autonomy in functioning. Conflict is a dynamic situation which may take the organisation to greater heights when it is positive or may ruin the organisation if it is negative. By and large conflict is the most necessary aspect in the changing scenario of business as there are plenty of things that changes and teaches to the managers and other stake holders of business."
