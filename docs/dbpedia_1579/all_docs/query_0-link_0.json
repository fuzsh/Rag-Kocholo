        "text": "PLEASE READ\n\n1. All summer transfers should be submitted as immediate (starting from the start of the game, NO future transfers).\n\n2. Duration on loaned players should be -1 year. Example: if a loan ends on June 2025 (in real life), the loan should be submitted until June 2024 (on site). If a loan ends on December 2024 (in real life), the loan should be submitted until December 2023 (on site). Loans MUST be more than 3 months duration.\n\n3. Those who submit STAFF changes, please provide an official source that shows the transfer/release. Transfermarkt isn't always trustworthy when it comes to staff.\n\n4. If a transfer/staff change IS NOT accepted more than 2 times, that means something. So please, avoid spamming in this crucial period. Time is important.\n\nThanks"
