        "text": "An exciting striker David Moyes wanted to bring to West Ham United has been ruled out for over a year after picking up a serious injury playing in Europe.\n\nAs West Ham fans know only too well, Moyes elected not to sign a striker in the summer window.\n\nThat has left West Ham with injury prone Michail Antonio as the club’s only proper striker.\n\nMoyes wanted exciting young striker from Ajax after selling Haller\n\nThat’s despite Moyes shipping out Sebastien Haller to Ajax way back in January.\n\nHammers fans were sure Moyes would identify and sign a forward given he had six months to do so.\n\nOne player he did reportedly want to bring to West Ham was the exciting talent Haller was providing increased competition for at Ajax – Lassina Traore.\n\nMORE WEST HAM STORIES\n\nInsider claimed Moyes interest in Traore was genuine but Ajax did not want to sell\n\nAfter selling Haller, West Ham were said to be very keen on then Ajax youngster Traore according to De Telegraaf via Voetbal Primeur.\n\nAnd West Ham insider ExWHUemployee backed up those claims when speaking on The West Ham Way podcast at the time.\n\nFootball London also reported West Ham’s interest claiming Moyes faced competition from Premier League rivals Wolves.\n\nBut in the end Ajax reportedly told West Ham they did not want to sell, hoping they could tie the young forward to a new long-term deal.\n\nCut-price move to Shakhtar followed in the summer as Ajax feared losing young star for nothing\n\nWest Ham signed Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United in January instead and used him as a second striker.\n\nThen in the summer 20-year-old Traore – who was about to enter the last year of his contract – moved to Shakhtar Donetsk for around £8 million.\n\nNow the man Moyes reportedly wanted at West Ham has been hit by a cruel blow in his young career.\n\nShakhtar have confirmed that Traore faces a year out after a devastating injury during the Champions League game against Inter.\n\nMan Moyes wanted at West Ham ruled out for a year with devastating injury\n\nThe game was only seven minutes old when Traore and Denzel Dumfries both went for the same ball. The former West Ham target’s foot was accidentally caught under the Inter man’s body with his ankle and knee ending up at an unnatural angle.\n\nTraore was stretchered off in agony and now his club have released an update on his condition.\n\n“The knee joint structures are damaged,” explained chief medic Artur Hlushchenko on the club website.\n\n“In two weeks, he will be operated on. It takes time for the swelling to decrease to ensure sufficient knee joint flexion.\n\n‘The injury is really serious’\n\n“The injury is really serious. Traore’s recovery may take anywhere between nine months and a year.”\n\nIt is always sad to see any player injured, especially such a promising young star who had been linked with West Ham.\n\nLet’s hope he makes a full recovery and is back on the pitch next season with his whole career still ahead of him.\n\nMore West Ham news:\n\nWest Ham in Premier League top four by rights say football data experts.\n\nMichail Antonio releases Jamaica statement and it is great news for West Ham."
