        "text": "Part of the context to this great piece of investigative journalism is provided by the Russia Report published by Parliament's Intelligence & Security Committee in 2020. Despite the actions taken since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the core of its criticisms of the UK Govt still seem relevant. Some key lines... Intelligence and Security Committee questions whether Government took its eye off the ball on Russia, finds that they underestimated the response required to the Russian threat and are still playing catch up: ÔÇ∑ Russian influence in the UK is the new normal. Successive Governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London ‚Äòlaundromat‚Äô, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures. ÔÇ∑ This has led to a growth industry of ‚Äòenablers‚Äô including lawyers, accountants, and estate agents who are ‚Äì wittingly or unwittingly ‚Äì de facto agents of the Russian state.\" Several aspects of this report suggest that, more than 4 years on from the Russia Report, we're still playing catch up...\n\nEarlier this week, in yet another a landmark moment for the Committee on Foreign Investment, President Biden blocked a Chinese-owned deal locating next to an Air Force missile base in Wyoming. As background, CFIUS reviews real estate and business acquisitions if they result in control by individuals in foreign countries. The list of countries is long and includes many of the US's closest allies. For real estate deals, CFIUS jurisdiction can apply to deals located 99 miles from critical infrastructure, like air and sea ports, military bases, nuclear facilities, and others. Technically, \"greenfield\" acquisitions (for example, a ground up manufacturing facility) are exempt, but Orders like this one call into question the prudence of a project that relies entirely on that exemption. On this deal, importantly, the company did not file for CFIUS clearance in advance. The \"non-notified\" team found them. The Order specifically mentioned - as a major problem - that the company failed to notify CFIUS of the transaction in advance. Now the deal is dead and the company has to unwind the transaction immediately. The lesson? \"Trust is the coin of the realm\" is a common phrase for those of us who work with CFIUS. Fewer and fewer projects are relying on the greenfield exemption, and that trend will only continue after this Presidential Order. The conclusion? Filing a declaration with CFIUS will be part of diligence for many more FDI economic development deals. Let me know of any questions about deals involving foreign acquisition of a US business or real estate anywhere in the United States. https://lnkd.in/euGqfzaT\n\nüëâ A new push for the European #DeepTech ecosystem! The European Investment Fund (EIF) has just launched the Defence Equity Facility to invest in private funds (VC and private equity funds) with investment strategies targeting firms developing innovative defence technologies and dual-use potential. According to Commissioner Br√©ton, the goal is to be the first step in improving #access to finance, contribute to sending a positive signal to the market and stimulate private investment in support of defence innovation. Similar models are ongoing, such as NATO - Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and the NATO Innovation Fund (NIF). In 2023, I developed a project on #NATO Defense Innovation and Deep Technologies: Measuring Willingness and Effectiveness, at Carnegie Europe.
