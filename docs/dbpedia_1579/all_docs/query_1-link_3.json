Are we so focused on reinventing the wheel that we're neglecting incremental improvements to existing systems which can drive exponential improvement? Are we really solving the true needs of the clients or just trying to flog what we think is the ‚Äòright‚Äô solution? Perhaps the key lies in striking a balance - enhancing current #infrastructure while selectively integrating #transformative solutions. After all, true progress often comes from building upon solid foundations, not always starting from scratch. Looking forward to diving deep into these discussions with industry leaders and visionaries. What are your thoughts on balancing innovation with #optimization in the cross-border payments space?
