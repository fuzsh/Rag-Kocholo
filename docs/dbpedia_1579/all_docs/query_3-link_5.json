These include searches for stop and sbottom particles in a variety of decay modes, as well as for flavour-changing neutral current top-quark decays. The modeling of the Standard Model backgrounds to these processes is difficult and vital to the success of the searches. This talk presents recent results from ATLAS and CMS on searches for rare top processes and stop and sbottom pair production, using the data collected during the LHC Run 2.\n\nThird Generation Biofuels via Direct Cellulose Fermentation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDavid B. Levin\n\n2008-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP is a system in which cellulase production, substrate hydrolysis, and fermentation are accomplished in a single process step by cellulolytic microorganisms. CBP offers the potential for lower biofuel production costs due to simpler feedstock processing, lower energy inputs, and higher conversion efficiencies than separate hydrolysis and fermentation processes, and is an economically attractive near-term goal for ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÅthird generationÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÂ biofuel production. In this review article, production of third generation biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks will be addressed in respect to the metabolism of cellulolytic bacteria and the development of strategies to increase biofuel yields through metabolic engineering.\n\nThe Third International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect: Conference Highlights.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBesharov, Douglas J.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nPresents highlights from the Third International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect.

In this work, using the third-generation industrial computed tomography developed at the IPEN, a gas absorption column, used as a simulator column for industrial process was evaluated. It is a glass cylindrical tube of 90 mm diameter and 1400 mm height constituted the following parts: random packed column, liquid circuit (water), gas circuit and analysis was used as a simulator column. Gamma ray tomography experiments were carried out, using this simulator column empty and filled with water. In this work the scanner was setting for 90 views and 19 projections for each detector totalizing 11970 projections. The resulting images describe the presence of liquid or gas phases and are possible to evaluate the linear attenuation coefficients inside the column. In this case, linear attenuation coefficient for water was 0.0813 cm-1. It was established that the newly developed third-generation fan-beam arrangement gamma scanner unit has a good spatial resolution acceptable given the size of the column used in this study.

Experiments were performed in a heterotrophic bubble column bioreactor. The study focused on the evaluation of the bioreactor (batch and fed-batch of different operational modes and the analysis of biofuel quality. Results indicate that fed-batch cultivations improved system performance, elevating biomass and oil productions to 12.0 g Lâ1 and 1.19 g Lâ1, respectively. The composition of this oil is predominantly saturated (60 % and monounsaturated (39 %, resulting in a biodiesel that complys with U.S., European and Brazilian standards. The technological route developed indicates potential for sustainable production of bulk oil and biodiesel, through the minimization of water and chemical demands required to support such a process.\n\nStatic third-harmonic lines in widely variable fiber continuum generation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTu, Haohua; Zhao, Youbo; Liu, Yuan; Boppart, Stephen A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn intriguing phenomenon of third-harmonic generation under fiber continuum generation is the emission of an anharmonic signal. One popular interpretation of this effect has developed into a general theory of fiber third-harmonic generation. Here we produce \"static\" third-harmonic lines dictated fully by fiber properties independent of pump parameters, in contrast to the signals of all known phase-matched nonlinear optical processes that vary dynamically with these parameters. We argue that the anharmonic signal is an illusion of the continuum generation, that it is in fact harmonic, and that this theory should be reevaluated.\n\nThird Generation Coaching\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nStelter, Reinhard\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGerman abstract: Auf der Grundlage aktueller Sozialforschung, neuer Lerntheorien und Diskurse der PersonalfÃ¼hrung entfaltet sich ein neues VerstÃ¤ndnis von Coaching und Coaching-Psychologie.

We find that competition between the group velocity mismatch and phase mismatch leads to third-harmonic generation that is sensitive only to interfaces. In this case, the spatial resolution is determined by the group velocity walk-off length. THG of modern femtosecond lasers in optical solids is a bulk process, without a surface susceptibility, but bears the signature of a surface enhancement effect in z-scan measurements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the model, by showing the agreement between the predicted spectral intensity and the measured third-harmonic spectrum from a thin sapphire crystal\n\nChild Home Care Allowance: Transition to Second- and Third-Order Births in Finland\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPajunen, Anni\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn this study, I study the relationship between the use of the child home care allowance and second and third births among women aged 19-44 in Finland. I use register data from the Finnish Census Panel (FCP) on 254 465 women who had a second or third child during 1993 to 2007. I apply discrete-time event-history analysis to examine whether women using the child home care allowance while their previous child was under the age of three have a higher risk to proceed to subsequent childbearing â ...\n\nTowards Second and Third Generation Web-Based Multimedia\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nOssenbruggen, Jacco; Geurts, Joost; Cornelissen, F.J.; Rutledge, Lloyd; Hardman, Lynda\n\n2001-01-01\n\ntextabstractFirst generation Web-content encodes information in handwritten (HTML) Web pages.

The science and technology community is now turning its attention toward the definition of a future third generation of FLIR sensors, based on emerging research and development efforts. Modeled third generation sensor performance demonstrates a significant improvement in performance over second generation, resulting in enhanced lethality and survivability on the future battlefield. In this paper we present the current thinking on what third generation sensors systems will be and the resulting requirements for third generation focal plane array detectors. Three classes of sensors have been identified. The high performance sensor will contain a megapixel or larger array with at least two colors. Higher operating temperatures will also be the goal here so that power and weight can be reduced. A high performance uncooled sensor is also envisioned that will perform somewhere between first and second generation cooled detectors, but at significantly lower cost, weight, and power. The final third generation sensor is a very low cost micro sensor. This sensor can open up a whole new IR market because of its small size, weight, and cost. Future unattended throwaway sensors, micro UAVs, and helmet mounted IR cameras will be the result of this new class.\n\nManufacture of Third-Generation Lentivirus for Preclinical Use, with Process Development Considerations for Translation to Good Manufacturing Practice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGÃ¡ndara, Carolina; Affleck, Valerie; Stoll, Elizabeth Ann\n\n2018-02-01\n\nLentiviral vectors are used in laboratories around the world for in vivo and ex vivo delivery of gene therapies, and increasingly clinical investigation as well as preclinical applications. The third-generation lentiviral vector system has many advantages, including high packaging capacity, stable gene expression in both dividing and post-mitotic cells, and low immunogenicity in the recipient organism. Yet, the manufacture of these vectors is challenging, especially at high titers required for direct use in vivo, and further challenges are presented by the process of translating preclinical gene therapies toward manufacture of products for clinical investigation. The goals of this paper are to report the protocol for manufacturing high-titer third-generation lentivirus for preclinical testing and to provide detailed information on considerations for translating preclinical viral vector manufacture toward scaled-up platforms and processes in order to make gene therapies under Good Manufacturing Practice that are suitable for clinical trials.\n\nThird party processing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nClark, S.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe importance of Canada's natural gas industry to remain competitive on a global level was discussed. Third party processing is a tool that the Canadian gas industry can use to overcome the relative disadvantage of smaller, and therefore more expensive, gas processing plants in Canada, and to maintain, and even improve, its competitive position vis-a-vis its US counterparts. The principal role of a third party processor is to provide midstream services such as raw gas gathering, field compression, gas processing, sales gas transmission, and natural gas liquids fractionation. Some third party processors also provide marketing services. Third party processors add value to the gas producer by reducing risk, reducing cost, improving reliability, and improving netbacks. The many variables involved in determining the economic viability of third party processing, including the quantity and deliverability of the raw resource, facility capacity, capital investment, operating costs, technology, fee structures, operational reliability, and speed, among others, were examined and the significance of each variable was explained\n\nA Third Branchial Pouch Cyst Presenting as Stridor in a Child\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nWasson, Joseph; Blaney, Sean; Simo, Ricard\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe present a rare case of a third branchial pouch cyst in an 18-month-old child, presenting with stridor and a lateral cervical cystic mass.

Third generation nuclear plants are equipped with dedicated systems to insure that if the worst accident were to occur, i.e. total core meltdown, no matter how low the probability of such occurrence, radioactive releases in the environment would be minimal. This article describes the EPR, representative of this \"Generation III\" and a few of its competitors on the world market.\n\nA Third Branchial Pouch Cyst Presenting as Stridor in a Child\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWasson, Joseph; Blaney, Sean; Simo, Ricard\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe present a rare case of a third branchial pouch cyst in an 18-month-old child, presenting with stridor and a lateral cervical cystic mass.

Also the future prospect is described. PF (2.5 GeV), SRS (2 GeV) and NSLS (2.5 GeV) were the second generation facilities in Japan, Europe and USA, respectively. The new technology for the third generation appeared in latter 1970s, and one of them is 'inserted light source'. The epoch-making development is the concept of low emittance ring. The third generation facilities are the new facilities which enable high brilliance synchrotron radiation by combining undulator with this low emittance ring. The features of the third generation synchrotron radiation are shown. The third generation facilities in X-ray and soft X-ray regions in operation and planning stage in the world are listed. In Japan, the SPring-8 on the largest scale in the world was completed, and the plans of University of Tokyo and Tohoku University are presented. These are explained. As the expected researches using the third generation facilities, the research on phase type X-ray CT, the utilization of micro-beam and others are mentioned.

John; Jack, Michael D.; Pettijohn, Kevin L.; Schlesselmann, John D.; Norworth, Joe\n\n1998-03-01\n\nSBRC is at the forefront of industry in developing IR focal plane arrays including multi-spectral technology and '3rd generation' functions that mimic the human eye. 3rd generation devices conduct advanced processing on or near the FPA that serve to reduce bandwidth while performing needed functions such as automatic target recognition, uniformity correction and dynamic range enhancement. These devices represent a solution for processing the exorbitantly high bandwidth coming off large area FPAs without sacrificing systems sensitivity. SBRC's two-color approach leverages the company's HgCdTe technology to provide simultaneous multiband coverage, from short through long wave IR, with near theoretical performance. IR systems that are sensitive to different spectral bands achieve enhanced capabilities for target identification and advanced discrimination. This paper will provide a summary of the issues, the technology and the benefits of SBRC's third generation smart and two-color FPAs.\n\nDouble Ion Implantation and Pulsed Laser Melting Processes for Third Generation Solar Cells\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEric GarcÃ­a-Hemme\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the framework of the third generation of photovoltaic devices, the intermediate band solar cell is one of the possible candidates to reach higher efficiencies with a lower processing cost. In this work, we introduce a novel processing method based on a double ion implantation and, subsequently, a pulsed laser melting (PLM process to obtain thicker layers of Ti supersaturated Si. We perform ab initio theoretical calculations of Si impurified with Ti showing that Ti in Si is a good candidate to theoretically form an intermediate band material in the Ti supersaturated Si. From time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements, we confirm that we have obtained a Ti implanted and PLM thicker layer of 135ânm. Transmission electron microscopy reveals a single crystalline structure whilst the electrical characterization confirms the transport properties of an intermediate band material/Si substrate junction. High subbandgap absorption has been measured, obtaining an approximate value of 104âcmâ1 in the photons energy range from 1.1 to 0.6âeV.\n\nChild Home Care Allowance and the Transition to Second- and Third-Order Births in Finland.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nErlandsson, Anni\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUsing register data from the Finnish Census Panel, this paper studies the relationship between the use of the child home care allowance and second and third births among women aged 20-44 in Finland during the period 1992-2007. Discrete-time event-history analysis is applied to examine (i) whether women taking up the child home care allowance while their previous child was under the age of 3 have a higher risk to proceed to subsequent childbearing, (ii) whether these women proceed to a further birth more quickly, and (iii) whether the risk to proceed to a subsequent birth is related to educational level. The results show that women using the allowance have a higher risk of having a second and a third birth than women not using it. The risk of having a second birth is higher than that of having a third birth. Also, women using the allowance get their subsequent child sooner than women not using the allowance. No large educational differences in the effect of allowance use are found for second or third births.\n\nTechnological challenges of third generation synchrotron radiation sources\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCornacchia, M.; Winick, H.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nNew ''third generation'' synchrotron radiation research facilities are now in construction in France, Italy, Japan, Taiwan and the USA. Designs for such facilities are being developed in several other countries. Third generation facilities are based on storage rings with low electron beam emittance and space for many undulator magnets to produce radiation with extremely high brightness and coherent power. Photon beam from these rings will greatly extend present research capabilities and open up new opportunities in imaging, spectroscopy, structural and dynamic studies and other applications. The technological problems of the third generation of synchrotron radiation facilities are reviewed. These machines are designed to emit radiation of very high intensity, extreme brightness, very short pulses, and partial coherence. These performance goals put severe requirements on the quality of the electron or positron beams. Phenomena affecting the injection process and the beam lifetime are discussed. Gas desorption by synchrotron radiation and collective effects play an important role. Low emittance lattices are more sensitive to quadrupole movements and at the same time, in order not to lose the benefits of high brilliance, require tighter tolerances on the allowed movement of the photon beam source. We discuss some of the ways that should be considered to extend the performance capabilities of the facilities in the future. 14 refs., 1 fig\n\nOptical Third-Harmonic Generation in Graphene\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSung-Young Hong\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available We report strong third-harmonic generation in monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition and transferred to an amorphous silica (glass substrate; the photon energy is in three-photon resonance with the exciton-shifted vanÂ Hove singularity at the M point of graphene. The polarization selection rules are derived and experimentally verified. In addition, our polarization- and azimuthal-rotation-dependent third-harmonic-generation measurements reveal in-plane isotropy as well as anisotropy between the in-plane and out-of-plane nonlinear optical responses of graphene. Since the third-harmonic signal exceeds that from bulk glass by more than 2 orders of magnitude, the signal contrast permits background-free scanning of graphene and provides insight into the structural properties of graphene.\n\nTHIRD-GENERATION FOAM BLOWING AGENTS FOR FOAM INSULATION\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThe report gives results of a study of third-generation blowing agents for foam insulation.

At very high carrier densities, carrier-carrier collisions dominate over carrier-lattice collisions and carriers begin to behave collectively to form plasma. Here, we apply a short-pulse laser to generate third-harmonic radiation from a semiconductor plasma (electron-hole plasma) in the presence of a transverse wiggler magnetic-field. The process of third-harmonic generation of an intense short-pulse laser is resonantly enhanced by the magnetic wiggler, i.e., wiggler magnetic field provides the necessary momentum to third-harmonic photons. In addition, a high-power laser radiation, propagating through a semiconductor imparts an oscillatory velocity to the electrons and exerts a ponderomotive force on electrons at the third-harmonic frequency of the laser. This oscillatory velocity produces a third-harmonic longitudinal current. And due to the beating of the longitudinal electron velocity and the wiggler magnetic field, a transverse third-harmonic current is produced that drives third-harmonic electromagnetic radiation. It is finally observed that for a specific wiggler wave number value, the phase-matching conditions for the process are satisfied, leading to resonant enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency.\n\nResonant third-harmonic generation of a short-pulse laser from electron-hole plasmas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKant, Niti; Nandan Gupta, Devki; Suk, Hyyong\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn semiconductors, free carriers are created in pairs in inter-band transitions and consist of an electron and its corresponding hole.

In this letter, the negative slope of the THG efficiency for high intensity ultrashort IR pulses is revealed to be a passive stabilization mechanism for energy jitter reduction in UV. A reduction of 2.5 times the energy jitter in UV is demonstrated in the experiment and simulations show that the energy jitter in UV can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude if the energy jitter in IR is less than 3%, with proper design of the THG efficiency curve, fulfilling the challenging requirement for UV laser stability in a broad scope of applications such as the photoinjector of x-ray FELs.

The relative importance of these two objectives changes as the nuclear program develops and the interim milestones are reached. This paper describes the three typical stages of nuclear power development programs. The first and the second generations are development phases with the third generation reaching self sufficiency. Examples are presented of European and Far East countries or regions which have reached or are about to step into the third generation phase of development. The paper concludes that to achieve the objectives of a nuclear power self sufficiency, other than merely filling the need of economical electric power, a careful technology transfer plan must be followed which sets realistic and achievable goals and establishes the country as a reliable and technically competent member of the nuclear power industry\n\nPower: towards a third generation definition\n\nOpenAIRE\n\n13250612 - Zaaiman, Stephanus Johannes\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPower is a well-established concept in the social sciences especially in the political sciences.

The ponderomotive force of laser causes density perturbations in cluster electron density which couples with wiggler magnetic field to produce a nonlinear current that generates transverse third harmonic. An intense short pulse laser propagating through a gas embedded with atomic clusters, converts it into hot plasma balls via tunnel ionization. Initially, the electron plasma frequency inside the clusters Ï pe > \\\\sqrt{3}{Ï }1 (with Ï 1 being the frequency of the laser). As the cluster expands under Coulomb force and hydrodynamic pressure, Ï pe decreases to \\\\sqrt{3}{Ï }1. At this time, there is resonant enhancement in the efficiency of the third harmonic generation. The efficiency of third harmonic generation is enhanced due to cluster plasmon resonance and by phase matching due to wiggler magnetic field. The effect of cluster size on the expansion rate is studied to observe that the clusters of different radii would expand differently. The impact of laser intensity and wiggler magnetic field on the efficiency of third harmonic generation is also explored.\n\nThird international seminar on horizontal steam generators\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe Third International Seminar on Horizontal Steam Generators held on October 18-20, 1994 in Lappeenranta, consisted of six sessions dealing with the topics: thermal hydraulic experiments and analyses, primary collector integrity, management of primary-to-secondary leakage accidents, feedwater collector replacement and discussion of VVER-440 steam generator safety issues.\n\nThird international seminar on horizontal steam generators\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe Third International Seminar on Horizontal Steam Generators held on October 18-20, 1994 in Lappeenranta, consisted of six sessions dealing with the topics: thermal hydraulic experiments and analyses, primary collector integrity, management of primary-to-secondary leakage accidents, feedwater collector replacement and discussion of VVER-440 steam generator safety issues\n\nThird international seminar on horizontal steam generators\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1996-12-31\n\nThe Third International Seminar on Horizontal Steam Generators held on October 18-20, 1994 in Lappeenranta, consisted of six sessions dealing with the topics: thermal hydraulic experiments and analyses, primary collector integrity, management of primary-to-secondary leakage accidents, feedwater collector replacement and discussion of VVER-440 steam generator safety issues.\n\nPhase-matched third harmonic generation in a plasma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRax, J.M.; Fisch, N.J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nRelativistic third harmonic generation in a plasma is investigated. The growth of a third harmonic wave is limited by the difference between the phase velocity of the pump and driven waves. This phase velocity mismatch results in a third harmonic amplitude saturation and oscillation. In order to overcome this saturation, the authors describe a phase-matching scheme based on a resonant density modulation. The limitations of this scheme are analyzed\n\nSilicon nanostructures for third generation photovoltaic solar cells\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nConibeer, Gavin; Green, Martin; Corkish, Richard; Cho, Young; Cho, Eun-Chel; Jiang, Chu-Wei; Fangsuwannarak, Thipwan; Pink, Edwin; Huang, Yidan; Puzzer, Tom; Trupke, Thorsten; Richards, Bryce; Shalav, Avi; Lin, Kuo-lung\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe concept of third generation photovoltaics is to significantly increase device efficiencies whilst still using thin film processes and abundant non-toxic materials. This can be achieved by circumventing the Shockley-Queisser limit for single band gap devices, using multiple energy threshold approaches. At University of NSW, as part of our work on Third Generation devices, we are using the energy confinement of silicon based quantum dot nanostructures to engineer wide band gap materials to be used as upper cell elements in Si based tandem cells. HRTEM data shows Si nanocrystal formation in oxide and nitride matrixes with a controlled nanocrystal size, grown by layered reactive sputtering and layered PECVD. Photoluminescence evidence for quantum confinement in the Si quantum dots in oxide agrees with the calculated increase in PL energy with reduction in dot size. Resistivity measurements with temperature give tentative proof of conduction and we are investigating junction formation in these materials. We are also using similar Si quantum dot structures in double barrier resonant tunneling structures for use in hot carrier solar cell contacts. These must collect carriers over a limited energy range. Negative differential resistance has been observed in room temperature I-V on these samples, a necessary proof of concept for selective energy filter contacts\n\nThe third generation of nuclear power development\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTownsend, H.D.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nDeveloping nations use the nuclear plant option to satisfy important overall national development objectives, in addition to providing economical electric power. The relative importance of these two objectives changes as the nuclear program develops and the interim milestones are reached. This paper describes the three typical stages of nuclear power development programs. The first and the second generations are development phases with the third generation reaching self sufficiency. Examples are presented of European and Far East countries or regions which have reached of are about to step into the third generation phase of development. The paper concludes that to achieve the objective of a nuclear power self sufficiency, other than merely filling the need of economical electric power, a careful technology transfer plan must be followed which sets realistic and achievable goals and establishes the country as a reliable and technically competent member of the nuclear power industry.

I exploit a unique data set of linked confidential use birth records in California and Florida from 1970-2009. The confidential data allow me to link mothers giving birth in 1989-2009 to their own birth certificate records in 1970-1985 and to identify second-generation siblings. Thus, I can analyze the relationship between the parental exogamy of second-generation Hispanic women and the birth outcomes of their offspring controlling for grandmother fixed effects as well as indicators for second generation's birth weight. Despite their higher socioeconomic status, third-generation children of second-generation intermarried Hispanic women are more likely to have poor health at birth, even after I account for second-generation health at birth and employ only within-family variations in the extent of assimilation. I find that a second-generation Hispanic woman married to a non-Hispanic man is 9 % more likely to have a child with low birth weight relative to a second-generation woman married to another Hispanic. These results largely reflect the higher incidence of risky behaviors (e.g., smoking during pregnancy) among intermarried Hispanic women.\n\nSearch for third generation squarks at the LHC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWeber, H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe present the results of searches of ATLAS and CMS experiments for third generation squark production in the context of supersymmetry. In many scenarios of supersymmetry the super-partners of the bottom and top quark are the lightest squarks. These particles could therefore be the first sparticles observed at the LHC. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have a wide variety of searches sensitive to third generation squark production that have been conducted with the 2011 data sets. Their results are interpreted in simplified models where limits on different production and decay channels of stop and sbottom quarks have been set.

We show that quasi-phase matching between the third-harmonic signal and the fundamental mode is provided in this geometry by coupling to the continuum of radiation modes above the light line. This process sustains third-harmonic generation with a relatively high efficiency and a substantial bandwidth limited only by the slow light window of the fundamental mode. The results give us insights into the physics of this nonlinear process in the presence of strong absorption and dispersion at visible wavelengths where bandstructure calculations are problematic. Since the characteristics (e.g. angular pattern) of the third-harmonic light primarily depend on the fundamental mode dispersion, they could be readily engineered.\n\nThird-generation cephalosporins as antibiotic prophylaxis in neurosurgery : What's the evidence?\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nLiu, Weiming; Neidert, Marian Christoph; Groen, Rob J.

The third-harmonic pulse maintains both its peak intensity and energy over distances much longer than the characteristic coherence length. We argue that this is due to a nonlinear phase-locking mechanism between the two pulses in the filament and is independent of the initial material wave-vector mismatch. A rich spatiotemporal propagation dynamics of the third-harmonic pulse is predicted. Potential applications of this phenomenon to other parametric processes are discussed\n\nChild Adjustment and Parent Functioning: Considering the Role of Child Driven Effects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYan, Ni; Ansari, Arya\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBased on 13,694 mother-child dyads from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), this study examined the bidirectional relations between parental and child functioning from kindergarten through third grade. Results from the cross-lagged models demonstrated that child-driven effects co-occurred with parental effects and these effects were comparable in size. At the same time, however, results from the latent profile analysis revealed idiosyncratic patterns of parent and child functioning. Compared with children in the least optimal functioning profiles, those in the average and above average profiles elicited greater improvements in parentsâ functioning over time. Although children characterized by poor academic performance at kindergarten appeared to precede parents characterized by harsh parenting at third grade, there was a threshold in the evolving strength of the overall child-driven effects. Taken together, the results from this study underscore the importance of considering reciprocal processes in the parent-child dynamic while also underscoring individual differences in these processes across the early to middle childhood years.

Perturbative nonlinear optics predicts that the TH signal will oscillate periodically with the relative phases of the two-colour driving laser fields due to the interference of TH signals from a direct third-harmonic-generation (THG) channel and a four-wave mixing (FWM) channel. For the first time, we show unequivocal experimental evidence of this effect. A modulation level as high as 0.35 is achieved by waveform control of the two-colour laser field. The modulation also offers a promising way to retrieve the relative phase value of the two-colour laser field.

[Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana -Iztapalapa, Division de Ciencias Basicas e Ingenieria (Mexico)\n\n2009-06-15\n\nThird-order nonlinear models are commonly used in control theory for the analysis of the stability of both open-loop and closed-loop synchronous machines. However, the ability of these models to describe the electrical machine dynamics has not been tested experimentally. This work focuses on this issue by addressing the parameters identification problem for third-order models for synchronous generators. For a third-order model describing the dynamics of power angle {delta}, rotor speed {omega} and quadrature axis transient EMF E{sub q}{sup '}, it is shown that the parameters cannot be identified because of the effects of the unknown initial condition of E{sub q}{sup '}. To avoid this situation, a model that incorporates the measured electrical power dynamics is considered, showing that state measurements guarantee the identification of the model parameters. Data obtained from a 7 kVA lab-scale synchronous generator and from a 150 MVA finite-element simulation were used to show that, at least for the worked examples, the estimated parameters display only moderate variations over the operating region. This suggests that third-order models can suffice to describe the main dynamical features of synchronous generators, and that third-order models can be used to design and tune power system stabilizers and voltage regulators.

In the third-plus generation, black and Hispanic children have higher rates of nearly all conditions. Health care, socioeconomic status, parents' health, social support, and neighborhood conditions influence child health and help explain third-and-higher-generation racial/ethnic disparities. However, these factors do not explain the generational pattern. The generational pattern may reflect cohort changes, selective ethnic attrition, unhealthy assimilation, or changing responses to survey questions among immigrant groups.\n\nPharmacodynamics and common drug-drug interactions of the third-generation antiepileptic drugs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStefanoviÄ, SrÄan; JankoviÄ, Slobodan M; NovakoviÄ, Milan; MilosavljeviÄ, Marko; FoliÄ, Marko\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAnticonvulsants that belong to the third generation are considered as 'newer' antiepileptic drugs, including: eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, perampanel, brivaracetam, rufinamide and stiripentol. Areas covered: This article reviews pharmacodynamics (i.e. mechanisms of action) and clinically relevant drug-drug interactions of the third-generation antiepileptic drugs. Expert opinion: Newer antiepileptic drugs have mechanisms of action which are not shared with the first and the second generation anticonvulsants, like inhibition of neurotransmitters release, blocking receptors for excitatory amino acids and new ways of sodium channel inactivation. New mechanisms of action increase chances of controlling forms of epilepsy resistant to older anticonvulsants. Important advantage of the third-generation anticonvulsants could be their little propensity for interactions with both antiepileptic and other drugs observed until now, making prescribing much easier and safer. However, this may change with new studies specifically designed to discover drug-drug interactions. Although the third-generation antiepileptic drugs enlarged therapeutic palette against epilepsy, 20-30% of patients with epilepsy is still treatment-resistant and need new pharmacological approach. There is great need to explore all molecular targets that may directly or indirectly be involved in generation of seizures, so a number of candidate compounds for even newer anticonvulsants could be generated.\n\nSingle nano-hole as a new effective nonlinear element for third-harmonic generation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMelentiev, P N; Konstantinova, T V; Afanasiev, A E; Balykin, V I; Kuzin, A A; Baturin, A S; Tausenev, A V; Konyaschenko, A V\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this letter, we report on a particularly strong optical nonlinearity at the nanometer scale in aluminum.

Besides adding mobility to the internet, 3G systems will provide location-based services, as well as personalized information and entertainment. Low cost, high dynamic-range radios, both for base stations (BS) and for mobile stations (MS) are required to enable worldwide deployment of such networks. A receiver's reference sensitivity, intermodulation characteristics, and blocking characteristics, set by a wireless standard, define performance requirements of individual components of a receiver front end. Since base station handles multiple signals from various distances simultaneously, its radio specifications are significantly more demanding than those for mobile devices. While high level of integration has already been achieved for second generation hand-sets using low-cost silicon technologies, the cost and size reduction of base stations still remains a challenge and necessity. While silicon RFIC technology is steadily improving, it is still difficult to achieve noise figure (NF), linearity, and phase noise requirements with presently available devices. This paper will discuss base station specification for 2G (GSM) and 3G (UMTS) systems, as well as the feasibility of implementing base station radios in low-cost silicon processes.\n\nThird generation synchrotron radiation applied to materials science\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKaufmann, E.N.; Yun, W.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nUtility of synchrotron radiation for characterization of materials and ramifications of availability of new third-generation, high-energy, high-intensity sources of synchrotron radiation are discussed.

Subjects and methods. Envelope randomization was used to make up two groups, each comprising 10 patients, operated on for gastric cancer in the scope of gastrectomy. A control group received parenteral nutrition having the following components: Lipofundin MST/LST 20%, (500 ml daily + Nutriflex 48/150 (B. Braun (1000 ml daily, 1744 kcal/day. The study group patients were given Lipoplus 20% (500 ml daily + Nutriflex 48/150 (1000 ml daily, 1745 kcal/day. Parenteral nutrition was used on postoperative days 1 to 5. Results. Nutritional status evaluation revealed a significant increase in the concentration of total protein and albumin in the control and study group patients on postoperative day 6. The use of both second- and third-generation fatty emulsions caused a significant increase in the concentration of triglycerides on day 6 after surgery; no differences were found between the groups. On day 6 following surgery, there was a significant decrease in IL-4 in both groups (p<0.05. At the same time the Lipofundin MST/LST group showed a significantly lower concentration of IL-4 than did the study group (p<0.05. After termination of a parenteral nutrition course, the study and control groups showed a significant decrease in one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines â IL-6. Conclusion. In the study group, the serum anti-inflammatory activity of IL-4 was more evident than that in the control group and the proinflammatory activity (IL-6 concentration decreased, which can support that as compared with the second-generation fatty emulsions, third-generation ones with a balanced omega 3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio (1:2.7 had a normalizing effect on systemic inflammatory processes and cytokine balance with increased anti-inflammatory and reduced proinflammatory activities.

Significant enhancement of the third-harmonic generation is obtained due to the disturbance of the additional plasma.

It is shown that the plasma induced cancellation of destructive interference [Y. Liu et al., Opt.

Among the various NLO phenomena the third-harmonic generation (THG) is at the core of the effective operating mechanism of broadband wavelength conversion, in all-optical devices. Here, we aim to understand how the third-order susceptibility and the electric field may be effectively effect on the localization properties of the light in the THG process when included in a two-mode cavity coherently perturbed by a classical field. We address a stable-unstable transition due to the combination effect of the aforementioned factors. We report a reliable evidence confirming the appearance of chaos in THG under suitable conditions. By tracing the signatures of adjacent-spectral-spacing-ratio (ASSR) distribution and participation ratio, we also find a critical point (Éc ,Îºc) =(3 . 1 , 0 . 35) for which a pronounced delocalized response is seen. This study may have profound findings for practical devices, and ushers in new opportunities for practical exploitation of the electric field and the third-order susceptibility effect in nonlinear optical devices.\n\nSpectral and spatial characteristics of third-harmonic generation in conical light beams\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPeet, V.E.; Shchemeljov, S.V.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nGeneration of resonance-enhanced third harmonic in Bessel and other conical beams is analyzed from a simple picture, where the fundamental light field is decomposed into elementary configurations of crossed plain-wave sub-beams.

The first MTG satellite, MTG-I1, which is scheduled for launch at the end of 2018, will host two imaging instruments: the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Lightning Imager. The FCI will provide continuation of the SEVIRI imager operations on the current Meteosat Second Generation satellites (MSG), but with an improved spatial, temporal and spectral resolution, not dissimilar to GOES-R (of NASA/NOAA). Unlike SEVIRI on the spinning MSG spacecraft, the FCI will be mounted on a 3-axis stabilised platform and a 2-axis tapered scan will provide a full coverage of the Earth in 10 minute repeat cycles. Alternatively, a rapid scanning mode can cover smaller areas, but with a better temporal resolution of up to 2.5 minutes. In order to assess some of the data acquisition and processing aspects which will apply to the FCI, a simplified end-to-end imaging chain prototype was set up. The simulation prototype consists of four different functional blocks: - A function for the generation of FCI-like references images - An image acquisition simulation function for the FCI Line-of-Sight calculation and swath generation - A processing function that reverses the swath generation process by rectifying the swath data - An evaluation function for assessing the quality of the processed data with respect to the reference images This paper presents an overview of the FCI instrument chain prototype, covering instrument characteristics, reference image generation, image acquisition simulation, and processing aspects. In particular, it provides in detail the description of the generation of references images, highlighting innovative features, but also limitations. This is followed by a description of the image acquisition simulation process, and the rectification and evaluation function. The latter two are described in more detail in a separate paper.

O.; Fedotov, A. B.; Ivanov, A. A.; Alfimov, M. V.; Zabotnov, S. V.; Naumov, A. N.; Sidorov-Biryukov, D. A.; Podshivalov, A. A.; Petrov, A. N.; Fornarini, L.; Carpanese, M.; Ferrante, G.; Fantoni, R.; Zheltikov, A. M.\n\n2003-09-01\n\nSecond- and third-harmonic generation processes are shown to allow the detection of absorptive agglomerates of nanocrystals in transparent materials and the visualization of optical breakdown in nanocomposite materials. Correlations between laser-induced breakdown and the behavior of the second- and third-harmonic signals produced in SiC/PMMA nanocomposite films are studied. The potential of second- and third-harmonic generation for the on-line visualization of laser breakdown in nanocomposite polymer materials is revealed, with the ablative material removal being monitored by the decay of the second- and third-harmonic signals. The second and third harmonics generated around the optical breakdown threshold by 75-fs pulses of 1.25-Î¼m Cr:forsterite laser radiation are respectively more than two and four orders of magnitude more intense than the second and third harmonics produced under identical conditions by 40-ps pulses of a Nd:YAG laser. The breakdown threshold for PMMA films doped with 10-20-nm SiC nanocrystals forming absorptive agglomerates are demonstrated to be more than an order of magnitude lower than the breakdown threshold for crystalline SiC and about an order of magnitude lower than that for nondoped PMMA films.\n\nCognitive processes associated with child neglect.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHildyard, Kathryn; Wolfe, David\n\n2007-08-01\n\nTo compare neglectful and non-neglectful mothers on information processing tasks related to child emotions, behaviors, the caregiving relationship, and recall of child-related information. A natural group design was used. Neglectful mothers (N=34) were chosen from active, chronic caseloads; non-neglectful comparison mothers (N=33) were obtained from community agencies serving families. Participants were administered the IFEEL Picture task to assess maternal perceptions of infant emotions, eight vignettes of young children's behavior to assess attributions for child behavior across different scenarios, and a passage recall task to assess information processing problems. A measure of depression was used as a covariate to control for this variable. Neglectful mothers were significantly less likely to recognize infants' feelings of interest, more likely to see sadness and shame, more inaccurate at labeling infants' emotions, and had a more limited emotion vocabulary. They also made more internal and stable attributions for children's behaviors in situations where it was not clear whether a child was at risk of harm, and had poor recall of information. Depressive symptoms had little effect on these findings with the exception of information recall. Neglectful mothers show significant problems in information processing concerning their child's emotions and behaviors, which may affect their childrearing behavior. Cognitive-behavioral interventions to improve parents' abilities to recognize their child's emotions and to address maladaptive attributions may be of value.\n\nHole expansion test of third generation steels\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAgirre, Julen; Mendiguren, Joseba; Galdos, Lander; de ArgandoÃ±a, Eneko SÃ¡enz\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe trend towards the implementation of new materials in the chassis of the automobiles is considerably making more complex the manufacturing of the components that built it up. In this scenario materials with higher strengths and lower formabilities are daily faced by tool makers and component producers what reduces the process windows and makes the forming processes to be in the limits of the materials. One of the concerns that tool makers must face during the definition of the tools is the expansion ratios that the holes in the sheet may reach before producing a breakage due to the stretching of the material (also known as edge cracks). For the characterization of such limits, a standard test, the hole expansion test, can be applied so that the limits of the material are known. At the present study, hole expansion tests of a third generation steel, Fortiform1050 with a thickness of 1.2 millimeters have been carried out and compared them to a mild steel, DX54D with a thickness of 0.6 millimeters. A comparison for each material in terms of technology used to punch the hole, mechanical punching vs laser cutting has also been conducted. In addition, the measurement technique (online measurement vs offline measurement) followed in the Hole Expansion Ratio (HER) identification has also been analyzed. Finally, differences between both materials and techniques are presented.\n\nThird Dutch Process Security Control Event\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nLuiijf, H.A.M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOn June 4th, 2009, the third Dutch Process Control Security Event took place in Amsterdam.

The dielectric constant at incident and third harmonic wavelength is calculated using \"PARAV\" computer program. 1064 nm wavelength of Nd: YAG laser is incident on thin film and third harmonic signal at 355 nm wavelength alongwith fundamental light is obtained in reflection that is separated from 1064 nm using suitable optical filter. Reflected third harmonic signal is measured to trace the influence of Bi and Zn on third order nonlinear susceptibility and is found to increase with increase in Bi and Zn content in (GeSe3.5)100-xBix, and ZnxSySe100-x-y chalcogenide thin films respectively. The excellent optical nonlinear property shows the use of chalcogenide thin films in photonics for wavelength conversion and optical data processing.\n\nUltrafast third-harmonic generation from textured aluminum nitride-sapphire interfaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStoker, D. S.; Keto, J. W.; Baek, J.; Wang, W.; Becker, M. F.; Kovar, D.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe measured and modeled third-harmonic generation (THG) from an AlN thin film on sapphire using a time-domain approach appropriate for ultrafast lasers. Second-harmonic measurements indicated that polycrystalline AlN contains long-range crystal texture. An interface model for third-harmonic generation enabled an analytical representation of scanning THG (z-scan) experiments. Using it and accounting for Fresnel reflections, we measured the AlN-sapphire susceptibility ratio and estimated the susceptibility for aluminum nitride, Ï xxxx (3) (3Ï;Ï,Ï,Ï)=1.52Â±0.25x10 -13 esu. The third-harmonic (TH) spectrum strongly depended on the laser focus position and sample thickness. The amplitude and phase of the frequency-domain interference were fit to the Fourier transform of the calculated time-domain field to improve the accuracy of several experimental parameters. We verified that the model works well for explaining TH signal amplitudes and spectral phase. Some anomalous features in the TH spectrum were observed, which we attributed to nonparaxial effects\n\nThird Generation Flywheels for electric storage\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRicci, Michael, R.; Fiske, O. James\n\n2008-02-29\n\nElectricity is critical to our economy, but growth in demand has saturated the power grid causing instability and blackouts. The economic penalty due to lost productivity in the US exceeds $100 billion per year. Opposition to new transmission lines and power plants, environmental restrictions, and an expected $100 billion grid upgrade cost have slowed system improvements. Flywheel electricity storage could provide a more economical, environmentally benign alternative and slash economic losses if units could be scaled up in a cost effective manner to much larger power and capacity than the present maximum of a few hundred kW and a few kWh per flywheel. The goal of this project is to design, construct, and demonstrate a small-scale third generation electricity storage flywheel using a revolutionary architecture scalable to megawatt-hours per unit. First generation flywheels are built from bulk materials such as steel and provide inertia to smooth the motion of mechanical devices such as engines. They can be scaled up to tens of tons or more, but have relatively low energy storage density. Second generation flywheels use similar designs but are fabricated with composite materials such as carbon fiber and epoxy. They are capable of much higher energy storage density but cannot economically be built larger than a few kWh of storage capacity due to structural and stability limitations. LaunchPoint is developing a third generation flywheel â the \"Power Ring\" â with energy densities as high or higher than second generation flywheels and a totally new architecture scalable to enormous sizes. Electricity storage capacities exceeding 5 megawatt-hours per unit appear both technically feasible and economically attractive. Our design uses a new class of magnetic bearing â a radial gap âshear-force levitatorâ â that we discovered and patented, and a thin-walled composite hoop rotated at high speed to store kinetic energy. One immediate application is power grid\n\nTheory of third-harmonic generation using Bessel beams, and self-phase-matching\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTewari, S.P.; Huang, H.; Boyd, R.W.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nTaking Bessel beams (J 0 beam) as a representation of a conical beam, and a slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) we obtain the results for the theory of third-harmonic generation from an atomic medium. We demonstrate how the phenomenon of self-phase-matching is contained in the transverse-phase-matching integral of the theory. A method to calculate the transverse-phase-matching integral containing four Bessel functions is described which avoids the computer calculations of the Bessel functions. In order to consolidate the SVEA result an alternate method is used to obtain the exact result for the third-harmonic generation. The conditions are identified in which the exact result goes over to the result of the SVEA. The theory for multiple Bessel beams is also discussed which has been shown to be the source of the wide width of the efficiency curve of the third-harmonic generation observed in experiments. copyright 1996 The American Physical Society\n\nSecond/Third Generation Asian Business Entrepreneurs in the Uk\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSpinder Dhaliwal\n\n2004-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The âgrowthâ of Asian enterprises has been a much commented feature of the small business population. Asian entrepreneurs have been eulogized by the popular press keen to laud free enterprise heroes. More detached academic commentary has also sought to identify the key success factors for this entrepreneurial minority. This paper seeks to explore the role of the second/third generation of British Asian entrepreneurs who were brought up and educated in the UK. In order to analyze the position of second/third generation Asians in business, a series of qualitative interviews were undertaken with 10 respondents, five men and five women. The questions asked focus upon second generation banking, management style, use of technology and expansion. This paper sheds light n a number of neglected issues within the increasingly important area of ethnic entrepreneurship. First a clearer picture will emerge of the roles, responsibilities, vision and practices of this new generation of entrepreneurs. Second, methodologically the paper will be novel in so far as the gender and ethnicity issues are both taken into account. Half the respondents are women. Hence the study also aims to examine the hitherto neglected issue of womenâs experiences in managing enterprises. Finally, policy makers are increasingly reminded to appreciate the need of the diversity of ethnic minorities in business.\n\nSearches for direct pair production of third generation squarks with the ATLAS detector\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMeloni, Federico; The ATLAS collaboration\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis document summarises recent ATLAS results for searches for third generation squarks using 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collision data collected at $\\\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Despite the absence of experimental evidence, weak scale supersymmetry remains one of the best motivated and studied Standard Model extensions. Supersymmetry can naturally solve the Standard Model hierarchy problem by preventing a large fine-tuning in the Higgs sector: a typical natural SUSY spectrum contains light third generation squarks (stops and sbottoms). Both R-Parity conserving and R-Parity violating scenarios are considered. The searches involve final states including jets, missing transverse momentum, electrons or muons. Simplified models predicting pair production of third generation squarks have been excluded at 95% CL up to about one TeV in the most favourable scenarios.\n\nImaging theory of nonlinear second harmonic and third harmonic generations in confocal microscopy\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nTANG Zhilie; XING Da; LIU Songhao\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe imaging theory of nonlinear second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) in confocal microscopy is presented in this paper. The nonlinear effect of SHG and THG on the imaging properties of confocal microscopy has been analyzed in detail by the imaging theory. It is proved that the imaging process of SHG and THG in confocal microscopy, which is different from conventional coherent imaging or incoherent imaging, can be divided into two different processes of coherent imaging. The three-dimensional point spread functions (3D-PSF) of SHG and THG confocal microscopy are derived based on the nonlinear principles of SHG and THG. The imaging properties of SHG and THG confocal microscopy are discussed in detail according to its 3D-PSF. It is shown that the resolution of SHG and THG confocal microscopy is higher than that of single-and two-photon confocal microscopy.\n\nDoes intergenerational transmission of trauma skip a generation? No meta-analytic evidence for tertiary traumatization with third generation of Holocaust survivors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSagi-Schwartz, Abraham; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J\n\n2008-06-01\n\nIn a series of meta-analyses with the second generation of Holocaust survivors, no evidence for secondary traumatization was found (Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Sagi-Schwartz, 2003). With regard to third generation traumatization, various reports suggest the presence of intergenerational transmission of trauma. Some scholars argue that intergenerational transmission of trauma might skip a generation. Therefore, we focus in this study on the transmission of trauma to the third generation offspring (the grandchildren) of the first generation's traumatic Holocaust experiences (referred to as \"tertiary traumatization\"), and we present a narrative review of the pertinent studies. Meta-analytic results of 13 non-clinical samples involving 1012 participants showed no evidence for tertiary traumatization in Holocaust survivor families. Our previous meta-analytic study on secondary traumatization and the present one on third generation's psychological consequences of the Holocaust indicate a remarkable resilience of profoundly traumatized survivors in their (grand-)parental roles.\n\nEmotion at Work: A Contribution to Third-Generation Cultural-Historical Activity Theory\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRoth, Wolff-Michael\n\n2007-01-01\n\nSecond-generation cultural-historical activity theory, which drew its inspiration from Leont'ev's work, constituted an advance over Vygotsky's first-generation theory by explicitly articulating the dialectical relation between individual and collective.

In the case of alkali atoms, some ionization signals appear as a result of gas density effects (dimers or quasi-collisions) as previously discovered by Collins and his collaborators. These have been termed hybrid-resonances. By contrast, in the case of the rare gases, certain resonance ionization signals disappear with increasing gas density. The disappearance of the ionization signals in the rare gases is due to the interference of excitation of the third-harmonic and fundamental laser beam. At low pressure (10 -7 to 10 -5 torr) we have studied (1) mass spectra, (2) kinetic energy released in ionic fragmentation, and (3) photoelectron kinetic energy spectra using time-of-flight mass analysis and a 160 0 spherical sector electrostatic energy analyzer. These experiments, combined with two-color dye laser experiments, can often offer an unambiguous and detailed description of the MPI and subsequent fragmentation events. The major part of this talk will be devoted to the production and the use of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light from third-harmonic generation (THG) in the rare gases\n\nA third generation mobile high energy radiography system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFry, D.A.; Valdez, J.E.; Johnson, C.S.; Kimerly, H.J.; Vananne, J.R.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA third generation mobile high energy radiographic capability has been completed and put into service by the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The latest version includes upgraded and enhanced portability, flexibility, all-terrain operation, all-weather operation, and ease of use features learned from experience with the first and second generation systems. All systems were required to have the following characteristics; all-terrain, all-weather operation, self-powered, USAF airlift compatible, reliable, simple to setup, easy to operate, and all components two-person portable. The systems have met these characteristics to differing degrees, as is discussed in the following section, with the latest system being the most capable\n\nTheory of the effect of third-harmonic generation on three-photon resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization in focused beams\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPayne, M.G.; Garrett, W.R.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nMultiphoton ionization in the region near a three-photon resonance is treated for focused, plane-polarized Gaussian beams with diffraction-limited beam divergence. In this situation, a third-harmonic field is generated within the laser beam. At, and very near, three-photon resonance the driving rate for the upper-state probability amplitude due to one-photon absorption of third-harmonic light becomes nearly equal to the corresponding three-photon rate due to the laser field, but these effects are 180 0 out of phase. As a consequence of this cancellation between two pumping terms, the three-photon resonance line essentially disappears at moderate concentrations and the observed ionization has a line shape that is close to the phase-matching curve for third-harmonic generation. The ionization signal, near but not on the resonance, is due almost entirely to absorption of third-harmonic photons plus other laser photons; three-photon resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization by the laser is much weaker. This is particularly true on the blue side of the three-photon resonance at detunings where phase matching occurs. The problem is treated quite generally with predictions of the full line shape for n-photon ionization and third-harmonic light generation near three-photon resonance, including the rather strong influences of positively dispersive buffer gases. We also show that the cancellation between the one-photon and the three-photon process is partially spoiled in the presence of a counterpropagating beam at the same frequency\n\nThird-harmonic generation in isotropic media by focused pulses\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTasgal, Richard S.; Band, Y.B.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFor focused pulses of light in isotropic nonlinear media, third-harmonic generation can be strongly affected by group-velocity mismatch between the fundamental and third-harmonic. There is a characteristic time determined by the group-velocity mismatch and the Rayleigh range of the focused pulse. The dynamics depend on two dimensionless quantities, namely the ratio of the characteristic time to the pulse duration and the phase-velocity mismatch times the Rayleigh range. Pulses shorter than the characteristic time have physics described by simple analytic formulas. Pulses near the characteristic time have an intermediate behavior given by an explicit but more complicated formula. Pulses longer than the characteristic time tend to the continuous-wave case\n\nThird generation of lead slowing-down spectrometers: First results and prospects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlexeev, A.A.; Belousov, Yu.V.; Bergman, A.A.; Volkov, A.N.; Goncharenko, O.N.; Grachev, M.N.; Kazarnovsky, M.V.; Matushkov, V.L.; Mostovoy, V.I.; Novikov, A.V.; Novoselov, S.A.; Ryabov, Yu.V.; Stavissky, Yu.Ya.; Gledenov, Yu.M.; Parzhitski, S.S.; Popov, Yu.P.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nAt the same neutron-source intensity S, lead slowing-down spectrometers (LSDS) for neutrons possess luminosity 10 3 -10 4 times as great as that of time-of-flight spectrometers with the same energy resolution ÎE/E(bar sign) (for the former, ÎE/E(bar sign)â 35-45% at a mean energy E(bar sign) less than 50 keV). In combination with high-current proton accelerators, third-generation LSDSs can operate at S values exceeding those acceptable for second-generation LSDSs coupled to electron accelerators by a factor of 10 2 to 10 3 . At the Institute for Nuclear Research (Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow), the first third-generation LSDS facility called PITON (about 15 tons of lead) has been operating successfully and a large LSDS (more than 100 tons of lead) is now under construction.

For the third fermion generation Î¼ is the value of the dynamical techniquark mass (â¼250 GeV). We discuss how this possibility can be implemented in a technicolor scenario, and how the mass of the intermediate generation is generated.

Although both child and classroom characteristics have been implicated as contributors to children's success, there has been scant research linking child temperament, teacher-child relationship quality, and peer interactions in the same study. The purpose of this study is to examine children's early temperament, rated at preschool age, as a predictor of interactions with peers (i.e., aggression, relational aggression, victimization, and prosociality) in third grade while considering teacher-child relationship quality in kindergarten through second grades as a moderator and mediator of this association. The sample (N=1364) was drawn from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Results from structural equation models indicated that teacher-child conflict in early elementary grades mediated links between children's temperament and later peer interactions. Findings underscore the importance of considering children's temperament traits and teacher-child relationship quality when examining the mechanisms of the development of peer interactions.

In the current study, we examined the bidirectional relationship between children's depressive symptoms and dependent family stress. Results suggest that children's baseline level of depressive symptoms predicted the generation of dependent family stress 1 year later. However, baseline dependent family stress did not predict an increase in children's depressive symptoms 1 year later. In addition, we examined whether a larger context of both child chronic strain (indicated by academic, behavioral, and peer stress) and family factors, including socioeconomic status and parent-child relationship quality, would influence the stress generation process. Although both chronic strain and socioeconomic status were not associated with dependent family stress at Time 2, poorer parent-child relationship quality significantly predicted greater dependent family stress at Time 2. Child chronic strain, but neither socioeconomic status nor parent-child relationship quality, predicted children's depression symptoms at Time 2. Finally, gender, maternal depression history, and current maternal depressive symptoms did not moderate the relationship between level of dependent family stress and depressive symptoms. Overall, findings provide partial support for a developmental stress generation model operating in the preadolescent period.\n\nContribution of the magnetic resonance to the third harmonic generation from a fishnet metamaterial\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nReinhold, J.; Shcherbakov, M. R.; Chipouline, A.; Panov, V. I.; Helgert, C.; Paul, T.; Rockstuhl, C.; Lederer, F.; Kley, E.-B.; TÃ¼nnermann, A.; Fedyanin, A. A.; Pertsch, T.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nWe investigate experimentally and theoretically the third harmonic generated by a double-layer fishnet metamaterial. To unambiguously disclose most notably the influence of the magnetic resonance, the generated third harmonic was measured as a function of the angle of incidence. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when the magnetic resonance is excited by a pump beam, the angular dependence of the third harmonic signal has a local maximum at an incidence angle of Î¸â20â. This maximum is shown to be a fingerprint of the antisymmetric distribution of currents in the gold layers. An analytical model based on the nonlinear dynamics of the electrons inside the gold shows excellent agreement with experimental and numerical results. This clearly indicates the difference in the third harmonic angular pattern at electric and magnetic resonances of the metamaterial.\n\n[The Process of Healing Child Physical Abuse: Sprouting and Twining].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChang, Hsin-Yi; Feng, Jui-Ying; Tseng, Ren"
