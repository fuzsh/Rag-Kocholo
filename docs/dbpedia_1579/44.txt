Both teams had UEFA Youth League games this week. The Miners’ head coach Oskar Ratulutra has fielded in the starting XI all those who played against Inter Milan U19.

Goal and assist by Honcharuk

The match began with an early goal by the Donetsk side. Already in the 4th minute, Artem Veklenko fed the onrushing Andriy Buleza who brought Danyil Honcharuk one on one with the Kyiv goalkeeper. The forward beat the keeper to score his tenth goal this season. The first half was bossed by Shakhtar lads, and in the 35th minute they managed to double the lead. Danyil Honcharuk burst into the penalty area and, after masterfully beating three opponents, sent it right to Anton Hlushchenko who just had to flick the ball into the back of the unguarded net, making it 2-0.

Dynamo's chance

The Kyiv outfit started the second half more actively, often challenging Shakhtar defenders and earning free-kicks. One of the hosts' free-kicks could have ended in a goal if Nazar Voloshyn had not seen his effort just shatter the post. The rest of the deliveries and shots were not so dangerous. Towards the end of the meeting, the White-Blues had more possession of the ball, but it did not lead to any scoring chances.

Shakhtar have won the 10th match out of 10 in the Ukrainian Youth Championship and continue topping the table with the biggest performance figures possible, being six points ahead of their Dynamo counterparts. Also, the Miners have outplayed the rivals in the third head-to-head meeting in a row. The Orange-and-Blacks will play their next match at home against Zorya Luhansk U19 on October 14.
