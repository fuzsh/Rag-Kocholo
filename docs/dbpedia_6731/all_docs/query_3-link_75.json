        "text": "The issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has long been a major source of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, and most of the international community. The Trump administration has now, however, stated that settlements are not inconsistent with international law.\n\nHere is a brief guide to what it is all about.\n\nSettlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nThis includes the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The West Bank and East Jerusalem had previously been occupied by Jordan since the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nAccording to the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now, there are 132 settlements and 113 outposts, external - settlements built without official authorisation - in the West Bank. The group says more than 413,000 settlers live there, with numbers increasing year on year.\n\nIt says there are 13 settlements in East Jerusalem, inhabited by about 215,000 settlers.\n\nIsrael also established settlements in the Gaza Strip, seized from Egypt in the 1967 war, but it dismantled them when it withdrew from the territory in 2005. It also built settlements in the Sinai Peninsula, seized too from Egypt in 1967, but removed them in 1982 as part of a peace agreement with Cairo.\n\nThere are also dozens of settlements on the occupied Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 war.\n\nBuilt-up settlement areas occupy about 2% of the West Bank but critics point out that the land controlled by settlement activity, such as agriculture and roads, amounts to much more than that, external and requires a heavy military presence.\n\nSettlers themselves choose to live in these communities for a range of reasons - from economic, encouraged by government subsidies, to religious, based on the belief that God gave the land to the Jewish people.\n\nPalestinians say the presence of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land they seek for a future state - make such a state with contiguous territory impossible. They have demanded Israel freeze all settlement activity as a precondition for resuming peace talks.\n\nPalestinians' freedom of movement is also restricted by hundreds of checkpoints, roadblocks and other obstacles used to protect both settlements and Israel from militants.\n\nA UN Security Council resolution in December 2016 said settlements had \"no legal validity, external and constitute[d] a flagrant violation under international law\". However, like previous resolutions on Israel, those adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter are not legally binding.\n\nOn 18 November 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration was reversing the stance of the previous administration.\n\n\"The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law,\" Mr Pompeo said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also overturned decades of US policy by recognising Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights - to the outrage of Palestinians - making the future of Jewish settlements there much more secure.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also gone further than ever before by declaring his intention to effectively annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea in the eastern West Bank, without fear of rebuke by the US. According to media reports, the plan is consistent with Mr Trump's vision for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, expected to be released in the near future.\n\nThe Palestinians have warned that if Israel extends sovereignty to the settlements, it will kill the peace process.\n\nMost of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal.\n\nThe basis for this is the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, external which forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory.\n\nHowever, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied.\n\nIsrael says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power.\n\nIt says the legal right of Jewish settlement there as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine was preserved under the UN's charter."
