        "text": "There are countless places in the world that I dream of reaching.\n\nCities I really want to visit.\n\nIntriguing historical sites.\n\nIf there's one thing I really like to learn, it's about other cultures. Different from the one I live in.\n\nOne of the places that surveys me is the huge Buddha of the city of Leshan, in China.\n\nHow did they manage to carve this giant statue into a rock?\n\nThe Buddha is located east of Shan City, Sichuan Province (China), where three rivers converge: the Min River, the Qingi River and the Dado River.\n\nThe statue is the most famous landmark of interest in the city.\n\nIn December 1996, the Buddha site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nStarting in 713 during the Tang dynasty and ending in 803, it took more than ninety years to carve this statue.\n\nDuring these years, thousands of employees invested their efforts and wisdom in the project.\n\nThe Giant Buddha, considered the largest Buddha carved in the world, is mentioned in poems, poems and stories.\n\nIn front of the river, buddha has a stable buddha and a symmetrical appearance that has been wonderfully captured in their festive silence. He is 71 meters high (about 233 feet) and his fingers are 8.3 meters long. The foot 9 meters wide (about 30 meters) is large enough to accommodate 100 people, and its shoulders are 24 meters wide (about 79 meters) wide enough to accommodate a basketball court.\n\nAs an architect, I'm always thrilled with the architecture of antiquity. The same luxury buildings that UNESCO cares about preserving, and recognizing. Not just for the environment in which they were built and harvested. It's, first and foremost, for all of us. That we humans will recognize. We'll teach them. We'll appreciate them. And most importantly, we will keep them, for the benefit of those who follow us.\n\nUnfortunately, as technology advances, we lose the beauty of traditional architecture, and ancient construction methods. Therefore, it is important to document and preserve them in every country and region.\n\nWant to know more about luxury buildings and polling places?\n\nYou are welcome to contact me by phone: 050-9847484 or 077-7020014\n\nOr write to me directly from here\n\nwwww.efratmeiri.co.il\n\nFor more information and details, fill in the details on the form and get back to you as soon as possible\n\nΔ\n\nMore articles on luxury buildings and intriguing places around the world\n\nMadayan Saleh Mada'in Saleh\n\nMudhif Mudhif House\n\nBäderarchitektur Resort Architecture – Resort architecture\n\nColorful crosswalk\n\nBosco Verticale - Bosco Verticale\n\nBerlin's underground tunnels\n\nArchitecture, buildings, art and what's built\n\nLuxury Buildings – Kinzua Bridge The Kinzua Bridge\n\nConstruction in the Ancient World – The Great Wall of China\n\nComments on Facebook\n\nComments on Facebook"
