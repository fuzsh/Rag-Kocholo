        "text": "Destroyed heritage\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a natural disaster, sorted by continent, then by country.\n\nCultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types—tangible and intangible cultural heritage. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, archaeological sites, and movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture.[1][2] This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectible heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored.\n\nDeliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as that carried out by ISIL and other terrorist organizations, is regarded as a form of cultural genocide.[3][4]\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nEgypt\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Library of Alexandria was destroyed during the Palmyrene invasion of Egypt and the following Roman counterattack during the 3rd century AD.[5]\n\nIn the late 12th century, Sultan Al-Aziz Uthman demolished part of the Pyramid of Menkaure.\n\nThe Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was heavily damaged by earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries, before being demolished[6] in 1480 to make way for the Citadel of Qaitbay. Some stones from the lighthouse were used in the construction of the citadel, and some other remains have survived underwater.\n\nVilla Aghion, Alexandria.[7]\n\nRock-cut portion of the Temple of Gerf Hussein, flooded by Lake Nasser.\n\nObjects stolen from the Mosque of Taghribirdi and Al-Rifa'i Mosque.[8]\n\nInstitut d'Égypte, destroyed on 17 December 2011 during anti-government demonstrations of the Arab Spring.[9][10] It reopened in December 2012.[11]\n\nLibya\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2011 Libyan Civil War, various sites were vandalized, looted, or destroyed.[12]\n\nIn March 2015, during the second civil war, the Islamic State destroyed Sufi shrines near Tripoli.[citation needed]\n\nThe Islamic State completely destroyed the tomb of Zuhayr ibn Qays, located at the As-Sahabah Mosque in Derna, in 2012 and May 2014.[13][14]\n\nMadagascar\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 1995, a fire broke out in the Rova of Antananarivo, a royal palace complex that had served as the home of monarchs in the Merina Kingdom since the 17th century. The fire destroyed or severely damaged all of its buildings.[15] The last 2 phases of the Manjakamiadana's (Queen's Palace) reconstruction was started by 2010, and by July 2020 the entire structure has been fully refurbished.[16]\n\nMali\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Great Mosque of Djenne was allowed to fall into disrepair after the conquest of Djenne by Seku Amadu in 1818. It was rebuilt in 1907, however.\n\nParts of the World Heritage Site of Timbuktu were destroyed after the Battle of Gao in 2012, despite condemnation by UNESCO, the OIC, Mali, and France.\n\nNigeria\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Benin Expedition of 1897, the British Empire launched a military campaign against Benin City, the capital of the Kingdom of Benin, and looted and burned the city. The Walls of Benin and the Royal Palace of the Oba of Benin were destroyed, while the Benin Bronzes are currently kept in the British Museum.\n\nDuring the 18th-19th century Fula jihads of West Africa, Fula jihadists destroyed Ngazargamu, the capital of the Bornu Empire.\n\nDuring the Battle of Gawakuke, the Sokoto Caliphate destroyed the Hausa city-state of Gobir.\n\nSudan\n\n[edit]\n\nFaras Cathedral, flooded by Lake Nasser, paintings salvaged and now in the Faras Gallery in Warsaw in Poland and the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum.\n\nSouth Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2021 Table Mountain fire partially or completely gutted several historical and/or culturally significant buildings and collections in the University of Cape Town, including Mostert's Mill (South Africa's oldest working windmill, built 1796) and the university's Special Collections Library, which held over 1,300 collections and over 85,000 books and other items, including a historically significant Bible, an original illustration of The Jungle Book, drawings, maps and transcripts of stories from the indigenous peoples of the Cape, a major dictionary of the Xhosa language, copies of historic Xhosa language newspapers, papers by Ray Alexander Simons, and archives of papers relating to many anti-apartheid movements.[17][18][19] It is known that the fire completely gutted the library's Reading Room but that a fire detection system prevented the fire from reaching the rest of the library, likely preserving most collections; however, some rare collections were likely lost.[20] A later assessment found that a vast majority of the African Studies Published Print Collection (about 70,000 items) and the entirety of the African Studies Film Collection DVDs (about 3,500 items) had been destroyed, along with documents relating to the university itself as well as any manuscripts or archives being kept in the Reading Room for digitization or after being digitized, but that the rare and antique collections kept underground, including significant documentation and works of the San and Khoi people who lived in the area in the 1870s, had been preserved.[21][22]\n\nZimbabwe\n\n[edit]\n\nGreat Zimbabwe has faced some damage since the colonial era. The removal of gold and artifacts in amateurist diggings by early colonial antiquarians caused widespread damage,[23] notably diggings by Richard Nicklin Hall, who was determined to find evidence that the monument was not built by indigenous Africans until he eventually relinquished this belief.[24] More extensive damage was caused by the mining of some of the ruins for gold.[23] Reconstruction attempts since 1980 caused further damage, leading to alienation of the local communities from the site.[25][26] Another source of damage to the ruins has been due to the site being open to visitors with many cases of people climbing the walls, walking over archaeological deposits, and the over-use of certain paths all have had major impacts on the structures at the site.[25] These are in conjunction with damages due to the natural weathering that occurs over time due to vegetation growth, the foundations settling, and erosion from the weather.[25]\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nAbkhazia\n\n[edit]\n\nA fire in 2024 destroyed the National Art Gallery in Sukhumi and all but 150 of its collection of 4,000 paintings.[27]\n\nAfghanistan\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Soviet invasion, large-scale looting occurred in various archaeological sites including Hadda, ancient site of Ai-Khanoum, the Buddhist monastery complex in Tepe Shortor which dates back to the 2nd century AD, and the National Kabul Museum. These sites were ransacked by various pillagers, including the pro-Russian government forces, destitute villagers, and the local crime rings. The National Museum of Afghanistan suffered the greatest damage, in which the systematic looting has plundered the museum collection and the adjacent Archaeological Institute. As a result, more than two-thirds of one hundred thousand pieces of museum treasures and artifacts were lost or destroyed.[28]\n\nA pair of 6th-century monumental statues known as the Buddhas of Bamiyan were dynamited by the Taliban in March 2001,[29] who had declared them heretical idols.\n\nArmenia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1870, a report by the Viceroyalty of the Caucasus recorded 269 Shia mosques in the region.[30] After 1917, many of the city's religious buildings were demolished in accordance with the Soviet government's modernization and anti-religious policies.[31] A mosque in Yerevan was pulled down with a bulldozer at the beginning of the year 1990, which was done as a result of Azerbaijan destroying the Armenian church in Baku.[32] Today there is only one mosque remaining in the city.\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n[edit]\n\nAzerbaijani authorities destroyed the Armenian cemetery in Julfa in December 2005 in the region of Nakhchivan.[33] The Azerbaijani representative of Nakhchivan denied that there was an Armenian cemetery there in the first place.[34]\n\nAzerbaijani authorities demolished the Church of the Holy Virgin in Baku in 1992 as part of their \"de-Armenisation\" campaign which also took place in Nakhichevan. The rest was turned into a restaurant.[35][36]\n\nAzerbaijani authorities demolished the Kanach Zham of Shusha, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, between December 2023 and April 2024.[37]\n\nBahrain\n\n[edit]\n\nAt least 43 Shia mosques, including the ornate 400-year-old Amir Mohammed Braighi mosque, and many other religious structures were destroyed by the Bahraini government during the Bahraini uprising of 2011.\n\nBangladesh\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral landmarks associated with the founding leader of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, were destroyed or damaged in arson attacks and looting that followed the Non-cooperation movement (2024), including his former residence in Dhaka, which was converted into the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum, as well as the Mujibnagar Memorial Complex. Other cultural institutions were also destroyed in the violence, including the 19th-century Bir Chandra Public Library in Comilla.[38][39]\n\nCambodia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Cathedral of Phnom Penh was the first building to be destroyed by the Khmer Rouge after the establishment of their regime,[40] as they considered it a physical symbol of everything they opposed. The Cathedral of Battambang was also destroyed in 1975 for the same reasons.\n\nChina\n\n[edit]\n\nThe historical Famen Temple went through several periods of destruction. First erected during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220), it was destroyed during the years of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–581). After being rebuilt, it was destroyed again by an earthquake during the Longqing's years (1567–1572) of the Ming dynasty. After another reconstruction, it was destroyed again during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976. The present structure was completed in 1987.\n\nThe Huang Chao rebellion (874–884) devastated the city of Chang'an, a historical capital of several ancient Chinese empires. The city was sacked and occupied by the rebels who looted and demolished the buildings, whose materials were then reused to build the subsequent capital city of Luoyang. Chang'an never recovered after this obliteration, and it was followed by the decline of the Tang dynasty. Huang Chao's former lieutenant Zhu Wen completed the destruction by dismantling Chang'an and transporting the materials east to Luoyang. A medieval Chinese source claimed that Huang Chao killed 8 million people.[41] Huang Chao's army in southern China committed the Guangzhou massacre against foreign Arab and Persian Muslim, Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian merchants in 878-879 at the seaport and trading entrpot of Guangzhou.\n\nDuring the systematic persecution of Buddhists in AD 845 by the Taoist Emperor Wuzong of Tang, more than 4,600 Buddhist temples were destroyed across the empire.[43]\n\nIn 955, Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou ordered the systematic destruction of Buddha statues due to the need for copper to mint coins. The ordinance led to the destruction of 3,336 of China's 6,030 Buddhist temples.[44]\n\nIn 1739, the Pagoda of Chengtian Temple was destroyed after a large earthquake struck the city of Yinchuan. The pagoda was subsequently restored in 1820.[45]\n\nThe Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, which dates back to the 15th century, was destroyed during the course of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864). A modern life-size replica was built in 2015.[46]\n\nIn 1860, much of the Old Summer Palace, a Qing-era imperial palace, was set on fire and sacked during the Second Opium War. The palace was later sacked again and destroyed by the Eight-Nation Alliance when they invaded Beijing.[citation needed]\n\nBeijing city fortifications which date back to the 15th–16th century were destroyed through the course of the decline of the Qing dynasty in the late 19th to early 20th century. They were severely damaged during the Boxer Rebellion (1898–1901), with the gate towers and watchtowers destroyed and troops of the Eight-Nation Alliance tearing down much of the outer city walls. After the collapse of the Qing in 1912, and end of the Republic of China in 1949, the fortifications were dismantled to build modern ring roads around Beijing. Today, nothing of the Outer City remains intact.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1921, Buddhist murals at the Mogao Caves were damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers fleeing the Russian Civil War.[47]\n\nOn 8 June 1928, the soldiers of warlord Sun Dianying ransacked Qing Imperial tombs including the tombs of Empress Dowager Cixi and the Qianlong Emperor.\n\nBuddhist murals at the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves were damaged by the local Muslim population. The eyes and mouths in particular were often gouged out. Pieces of murals were also broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals.[48][49]\n\nDuring the Kumul Rebellion in Xinjiang in the 1930s, Buddhist murals were vandalized by Muslims.[50]\n\nYongdingmen, the former front gate of the outer city wall of the Beijing city fortifications, which dates back to 1553, was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the new road system.

The fire is believed to have been caused by the ongoing restoration, though an investigation is ongoing.[196]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nMany historically and architecturally significant buildings were destroyed or severely damaged during World War II and the post-war period as a result of the Allied policy of area bombing of cities aimed at destroying or weakening infrastructure and war-related industry in the German Reich, as well as demoralizing the population by destroying urban cores and residential neighborhoods. Several hundred cities were destroyed, many of them by more than 80 percent. Striking examples are palaces like Berlin Palace, Monbijou Palace, and City Palace, Potsdam, as well as churches like Dresden Frauenkirche, Berlin Cathedral, and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Several have been rebuilt since 1990 (including all those mentioned except Monbijou Palace and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church).\n\nThe Paulinerkirche was a medieval church from 1231 in Leipzig.

The Ottoman army fortified the Acropolis of Athens and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine and a shelter for members of the local Turkish community. On 26 September, a Venetian mortar round blew up the magazine, and the explosion blew out the building's central portion. About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which caused fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes.[199][200] The Parthenon was extensively and permanently damaged when Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin and ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (occupiers of Greece in the early 19th century), who admired the Parthenon's extensive collection of ancient marble sculptures, began extracting and expatriating them to Britain in 1801. More damage to the site's heritage came after independence, when all Medieval and Ottoman features of the Acropolis (most notably the Frankish Tower) were destroyed by Heinrich Schliemann in a project to rid the site of all post-Classical influence.\n\nHungary\n\n[edit]\n\n(Destroyed buildings of Budapest and Destroyed buildings of Hungary, both in Hungarian)\n\nNumerous historical buildings in Budapest were damaged or destroyed during World War II, including the Hungarian Parliament Building, the Chain Bridge, and the Sándor Palace.
