        "text": "The geographical characteristics of Israel and of the areas under its control (the territory that had been Palestine under the administration of the British Mandate) over the twentieth century have undergone a metamorphosis, which from a comprehensive geographical approach embraces developments no other country has experienced in modern times. The wide range of factors, processes, and developments, and their by-products, from which what became known as the \"Palestine Problem\" has evolved, has created realities that cannot be fully comprehended without a reasonable acquaintance with their original and contemporary geographical attributes.\n\nThe territorial extent of the State of Israel is small (somewhat larger than Wales); however, the variety in its physical features, in its climatic conditions, in its natural and cultural landscapes is almost unique for such a limited area. It ranges from fertile, well-watered, very densely inhabited Mediterranean plains in the northwest, to the extremely hot and arid almost uninhabited lowest depression on earth, in the southeast. On the human side, its population has grown, over the last century, nearly twenty-fold (from approximately 600,000 to over 11 million); its average population density per sq km has increased from approximately 22 to over 420. The changes in the pattern and dispersion of settlement in the ethnic, demographic, and occupational characteristics of its population were also unparalleled. The share of the urban population, which was nearly 30%, has risen to 90%. The processes of transformation involved the abandonment of nearly 400 villages and hamlets, and the establishment of over 1200 new urban and rural settlements. At one stage nearly one-third of the country's [End Page 152] inhabitants left their homes to seek refuge, over 3 million immigrants from over 60 countries became its new citizens. This was accompanied by rapid and extensive urban and rural development, and provision of the modern efficient services and infrastructure of an advanced state.\n\nThe science of Geography was closely involved in the highly diversified transformation process, which Israel underwent in the twentieth century. Numerous studies continuously explored various aspects of the changes and their causes, which the environment, both physical and human, underwent under the impact of an almost unceasing sequence of political, economic, and social events. Lessons derived from some of these studies had conspicuous impacts on policies, practices, planning, and development projects of central and local authorities. Israeli geographers played prominent roles in governmental teams assigned to produce national, regional, or urban master plans and development projects. They were also involved, in an advisory capacity, in the evolvement of national and local policies and initiatives applied to problems such as boundaries, preservation of environmental qualities, and resources. Geographical factors are eminently interwoven in the texture of the \"Palestine Problem\"; however, most of the literature devoted to these aspects focuses on geopolitical, historical, and economic approaches.\n\nOutstanding and unique, in this respect, are the studies of Professor Elisha Efrat, one of Israel's veteran and most prominent geographers, who in his comprehensive studies over the last 45 years, has embraced and monitored most geographical aspects and phases of the geographical transformation of Israel (Palestine) and their reflections on the \"Palestine Problem\". His publications are, most probably, the best manifestations of geographical perceptions of the evolvement of realities of the \"Palestine Problem\" and of the present semblance of Israel and the territories under its control.\n\nEfrat was born in 1929 in the free city of Danzig (Gdansk), from which he and his family were expelled by the Nazis in 1939. They settled in Jerusalem where he earned his Ph.D. in Geography from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In his capacity as geographical adviser and later as director of planning in regional and urban development projects of the Ministry of Interior (1960–67), he was the first Israeli geographer to play a leading role in the initiation of national guidelines and control in the shaping of the future image of the recently born State of Israel. He was one of the founding fathers of the Department of Geography (1967) in the newly established Tel-Aviv University, where he held a dominant..."
