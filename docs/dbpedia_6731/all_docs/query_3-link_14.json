        "text": "1. Battle Hill\n\nA hill approx. 1,300 feet high at the western approach to Gush Etzion. This is where 35 of the armored Corps and Palmach’s finest soldiers fell in 1948 after setting out to bring help and supplies to besieged Gush Etzion settlements. Their story became an Israeli legend.\n\n2. Haritoun Cave\n\nA beautiful, natural karst rock cave on Tekoa River at the eastern edge of Gush Etzion, bordering on the Judean Desert.\n\nAccess is along a marked path. The cave is the longest in Israel (approx. 4.5 km.). There are some 4,000 hermit caves in the area dating back to the early Christian era.\n\nEntry with authorized guide only!\n\n3. Massuot Yitzhak\n\nRuins of the only remaining building (a convalescent home) on Massuot Yitzhak, a religious kibbutz which was founded in 1946 and was destroyed, along with three others Gush Etzion settlements, with the declaration of the State of Israel. The site has a JNF forest with playground facilities.\n\nAn educational farm dedicated to Gush Etzion’s heritage and an excellent venue for religious-secular meetings.\n\nObservation point with wonderful views over Jerusalem mountains and Judean plane.\n\nPhoto: Ron Peled\n\n4. Gush Etzion Springs\n\nEin Hatzvi (Ein Saj’ma), a spring emerging from two natural niches, used to flow into a small pool and from there to a larger one, 4.5 ft. deep. Irrigation terraces are cut into the base of the spring, a reminder of ancient agricultural methods. Shepherds’ caves are also carved out nearby.\n\nEin Massuot (Ein Hubela) A spring flowing through an underground tunnel into a pool at ground level. The spring was used by local residents during the Biblical and Second Temple eras.\n\nIn the 1940s the spring became a landmark and resting place for Palmach patrols and also served residents of Massuot Yitzhak.\n\n5. Path of the Patriarchs and Milestones\n\nThe Path of the patriarchs is a dirt path built over an ancient Roman road where milestones were also discovered, as well as a large ritual purification bath (mikve) dating from the 2nd Temple era. The mikve’s location – at the side of the main road between Jerusalem and Hebron – indicates that it was used by pilgrims on their way to the Temple in Jerusalem. The partition wall, steps, lobby and double entrance separated those descending into the mikve and those leaving it. “All utensils found on the way towards the plunge-bath, in Jerusalem, are unclean; those found on the way from the plunge-bath are clean: for they were not carried down to the plunge-bath the same way that these were carried up from the plunge-bath”. (Mishnah, Tractate ShekalimVIII: b). At the end of the road, in the northern part of Neve Daniel, is an observation point (2,275 ft.) over the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean. According to tradition, this was the place where the Patriarch Abraham looked out for the first time over Mount Moriah.\n\nPhoto: Ron Peled\n\n6. Biar Aqueduct\n\nAn enjoyable hike through water in a 27 ft. deep underground tunnel, which was part of a complex system of aqueducts built by Herod the Great to carry water to the Temple (according to the Talmud, the water was used to wash away the blood of sacrifices).\n\nOn this exciting walk through a conduit, the water sometimes reaches knee level.\n\n7. Herodion\n\nA desert hilltop fortress at the edge of the Judean desert called Herodion, to the East of the Gush Etzion settlements. Built by Herod the Great and named for him, the site was an important base of operations during the Great Revolt and the Bar Kochba Revolt, when Jewish zealots built a synagogue at the summit.\n\nThe interior of the mountain conceals impressive underground tunnels and cisterns, and the base houses a luxurious palace with a bathhouse and a huge swimming pool.\n\n8. Kfar Etzion Field School\n\nThe Field School was founded after the Six Day War along with the renewal of Jewish settlements in the area.
