        "text": "Tourism in Israel is a major economic sector and a significant source of national income. Israel offers a plethora of historical and religious sites, beach resorts, natural sites, archaeological tourism, heritage tourism, adventure tourism, and ecotourism. For practical reasons, this article also covers tourism in the West Bank and the Golan Heights, since it is closely interconnected with the mass tourism in Israel. In 2019, Israel saw a record 4.55 million tourist arrivals,[1] with tourism contributing NIS 20 billion to the national economy in 2017.[2][3][4][5]\n\nJerusalem is a central destination for tourists, home to sites such as the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Dome of the Rock. The city also offers numerous cultural and historical attractions, including the Israel Museum and Yad Vashem. Tel Aviv is renowned for its lively nightlife, cultural festivals, and Mediterranean beaches, and the \"White City\" district, appealing to both local and international visitors. Other notable attractions include the Dead Sea, famous for its high salinity and therapeutic benefits, Haifa and its Baháʼí Gardens, and archaeological sites like Masada, Beit She'an and Caesarea. The Negev Desert offers natural tourism opportunities at locations such as Ramon Crater and Timna Valley, with activities including hiking, camel trekking, and stargazing, while Eilat's Coral Beach Nature Reserve, located in the Red Sea, attracts diving enthusiasts. The Galilee provides a variety of activities such as boating, cycling, and bird watching, alongside its religious sites. Israel has the highest number of museums per capita in the world with over 200 museums.[6][7]\n\nReligious tourism is very popular in Israel and in the West Bank. Over the millennia, the Holy Land has been amongst the most visited lands in the world.[8] Many sites in modern Israel are considered holy in Christianity and Judaism due to their mention in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. As of 2007, the Western Wall and the Tomb of Rashbi were the most visited Jewish religious sites.[9] The most visited Christian holy sites include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth. The most visited Islamic religious sites are the Temple Mount (Al-Aqsa Mosque) in Jerusalem and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.\n\nIn 2017, the most popular paid tourist attraction is Masada.[10] The most visited city was Jerusalem and the most visited site was the Western Wall. The largest percentage of tourists came from the United States accounting for 19% of all tourists, followed by Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, Italy, Poland, and Canada.[11]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring Ottoman rule of the Holy Land, there was frequent travel from Mediterranean countries to the Holy Land despite wars between the Ottoman Empire and Christian states of the region. By the early modern period, people considered of lower social class were making pilgrimages to the Holy Land as well.[8]\n\nTourism to the Holy Land was mostly of religious nature until the 19th century, consisting of pilgrimages, with multiple monasteries and hospices hosting the pilgrims. In the 19th century, popular tourism began to reach the region with the advent of package tours by Thomas Cook and Son.[12] Cook's company arrange travel for 12,000 people, among them Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II.[12] With European powers taking more interest in the Holy Land by the second half of the 19th century, there was an increase in travel from Europe and the United States (a notable example is Mark Twain's tour of the Holy Land). In the 20th century mass tourism to Israel began.[8]\n\nMost-visited cities\n\n[edit]\n\nJerusalem\n\n[edit]\n\nJerusalem is the most-visited city with 3.5 million tourist arrivals annually as of 2017. One of the oldest cities in the world, it is the proclaimed capital of,[Note 1] and largest city of Israel, if the area and population of Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem are included. It is a holy city to the three major Abrahamic religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – and hosts many historical, archaeological, religious and other attractions.[13]\n\nWest Jerusalem was built starting in the 1800s with the expansion beyond the Old City walls, gradually expanded throughout the British Mandate, and continued after the creation of Israel in 1948. Selected tourist attractions in this area are:\n\nThe German Colony, a Temple Society settlement, with a colorful mix of architectural styles.\n\nMea Shearim, established in the nineteenth century and inhabited largely by ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews, retains the flavor of an Eastern European shtetl.\n\nYad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum.\n\nEin Karem, the traditional birthplace of John the Baptist, is one of the four most-visited Christian pilgrimage sites in Israel.[14]\n\nMount Zion, the traditional resting place of King David.\n\nMount Scopus, site of the Hebrew University and standing at 2710 feet or 826 meters above sea level, offers a panoramic view of the city. Both the Temple Mount and the Dead Sea are visible from this location.\n\nEast Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-day War and considered by the international community as Palestinian territory held under Israeli occupation, although it was effectively unilaterally annexed in 1980 under the Jerusalem Law. It is the location of:\n\nThe Old City of Jerusalem, traditionally divided into four parts: the Armenian, Christian, Muslim and Jewish Quarters. Notably, it contains the Temple Mount (known in Arabic as Haram ash-sharīf, the Noble Sanctuary), site of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem with only the Western Wall at its foot remaining, and now with the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nThe Mount of Olives and Kidron Valley: with its lookout point, Tomb of Absalom, and other Jewish tombs and burial grounds dating back 3,000 years[15][16][17][18][discuss], and Christian sites such as Gethsemane, the Church of All Nations, Dominus Flevit, and the Church of Maria Magdalene (Russian Orthodox Church). Various locations have been proposed as the Tomb of Jesus and/or as Golgotha, the nearby hill where he was crucified. Traditionally both have been believed to be in the vicinity where the Church of the Holy Sepulchre stands. Immediately south of the Jewish Quarter lies the City of David with archaeological digs including the Siloam Tunnel.\n\nThe controversial status of East Jerusalem has been an issue when attempting to market Jerusalem to international tourists. In 2009, 2010, and again in 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled against a series of Israeli Ministry of Tourism advertising campaigns that displayed images and information about tourist sites located in East Jerusalem. The Authority wrote in its ruling that \"the status of the occupied territory of the West Bank was the subject of much international dispute, and because we considered that the ad implied that the part of East Jerusalem featured in the image was part of the state of Israel, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead.\" Israel rejected the ruling, with the Ministry of Tourism releasing a statement that said the ad provided \"basic, accurate information to a prospective UK visitor\". The ruling from 2009 also included criticism about Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights being shown as part of Israel.[19][20]\n\nTel Aviv\n\n[edit]\n\nWith 2.3 million tourist visits in 2013,[21] Tel Aviv is Israel's second-largest city and a cosmopolitan, cultural and financial global city. The city's greater area is the largest with 3 million inhabitants. Tel Aviv exhibits a UNESCO world heritage area of Bauhaus architecture. The nearby historical city of Jaffa is experiencing a tourism boom. In 2010, National Geographic ranked Tel Aviv as one of the world's ten best beach cities.[22]\n\nTel Aviv is called the \"city that never sleeps\" by the locals because of its vibrant nightlife scene. Tel Aviv was named \"the gay capital of the Middle East\" by the Out magazine.\n\nSafed\n\n[edit]\n\nSafed is one of the four holy cities in Judaism, where much of the Jerusalem Talmud was written and the study of kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) developed. Famous for its artisans. The grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is in nearby Meron.\n\nAround the city, there are many nature reserves and archaeological sites notably the ancient synagogues.\n\nAcre (Akko)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Acre\n\nOld City and its Knights Hall\n\nEl-Jazzar Mosque\n\n(Baháʼí) Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh, resting place of Bahá'u'lláh as well as a Unesco world heritage historical town.\n\nHaifa\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Haifa\n\nCarmel\n\n(Baháʼí) Shrine of the Báb, its terraces, and the Baháʼí World Centre and the buildings (a Unesco world heritage).\n\nStella Maris Monastery\n\nTel Shikmona\n\nCave of Elijah\n\nMahmood Mosque\n\nTiberias\n\n[edit]\n\nTiberias is one of the four holy cities in Judaism, overlooking the Sea of Galilee.\n\nSaint Peter's house at Capernaum, Tabgha and the Mount of Beatitudes.\n\nNazareth\n\n[edit]\n\nNazareth is known as the 'Arab capital of Israel'.\n\nVisit Nazareth's old city and historical sites around the city\n\nJesus's hometown and the site of many of his reported acts and miracles.\n\nMany churches, including The Church of the Annunciation, the largest church building in the Middle East.

Regional capital of the Negev desert. It serves as a starting point for exploring such sites as the Ramon Crater or the UNESCO world heritage Nabataean Incense Route (Shivta, Avdat, Mamshit).\n\nEilat\n\n[edit]\n\nEilat, Israel's southernmost city, located on the Red Sea coast, is a hot, sunny year-round travel destination. Popular destination for skin and scuba diving, with equipment for hire on or near all major beaches, the Eilat Mountains are similar to those in Sinai and there are trail roads for hiking, where one can also find animals like dorcas gazelle, rock hyrax, striped hyena and Nubian ibex.

It is Israel's second busiest airport and served by a number of direct flights to and from Europe.\n\nAshkelon\n\n[edit]\n\nAshkelon is a city between Gaza City in the Gaza Strip and Ashdod. The city offers many hotels and Mizrahi Jewish restaurants.

Herod the Great built palaces for himself on the mountain and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE.

The researchers felt that increasing the number of international tourists by 2011 from 1.9 million to 4–5 million was a feasible goal. The report stated that Israel's most attractive feature for international markets was its religious culture and history and the great diversity it offers within a very small country.[63] According to the researchers, Israel's different cultures and religions, its diverse landscapes, the contrasts between cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv), and combination of European, North African and Middle Eastern culture produced a \"very high density of experience.\" The report recommended that Israel adopt appropriate marketing strategies to counter any perceived negative imagery associated with political developments.\n\nIn 2010, Israel won the title of \"most outstanding stand\" in all categories at the world's largest tourism fair, ITB, held in Berlin.
