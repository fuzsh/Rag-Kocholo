        "text": "To make this vacation different, here’s some great advice from trip-planning experts around the world. From the classic city outings to far off the beaten path\n\nT\n\nhe Big Apple has an abundance of shopping, museums, and famous landmarks. But the Tristate area is a gold mine for trips, with its mountains, plethora of magnificent parks, and of course, the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTRIP ADVISOR: Sarah Einhorn of Beentheredonethattrips.com\n\n“For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a fascination with outings,” Sarah relates. “Legend has it that when I was a baby, the way to get me to sleep was by strapping me into my car seat and driving around the block. Since then, my obsession with trips of all types has grown exponentially — the world is so big and there is so much to see!”\n\nSarah shares trip ideas on her blog, covering places all over the world, including New York, Europe, and Eretz Yisrael. She is also an avid photographer, and her work has been circulated in various publications.\n\nSomething Indoors: Northlandz\n\n“Before we visited Northlandz,” Sarah relates, “I thought it was made just for little boys. I sure was pleasantly surprised to see that it is suitable and even fascinating for adults and children alike.” Northlandz features 100 mini trains chugging along over eight miles of tracks. The railroad travels through various landscapes and crosses 40 bridges that stretch across manmade canyons. The museum was created and built by Bruce Zaccagnino Williams over 35 years ago, and he still maintains it together with his wife. Northlandz also offers an outdoor train ride on a genuine steam engine train and a doll exhibit featuring a 94-room dollhouse.\n\nGetting There\n\nLocated in Flemington, New Jersey, the museum is about an hour and 15 minutes from both New York City and Lakewood. Free parking is available onsite.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nStroller accessible.\n\nLunchtime\n\nThere is an onsite cafeteria where you can bring your own food.\n\nSomething Outdoors: Nyack Beach State Park\n\nAlthough the actual beach is miniscule, and no swimming or wading is allowed, there is a magnificent walking path near the Hudson River with views of the Tappan Zee Bridge. The path goes alongside the river on one side and has towering cliffs on the other. There is a five-mile out-and-back hike. At the one-and-a-half-mile mark, the path has an option to veer left and continue to Rockland Lake State Park.\n\nGetting There\n\nThe park is about 25 minutes from Monsey and an hour from the Brooklyn Bridge. There is parking on site.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nThe path can be rocky, so make sure you have a good-quality stroller.\n\nLunchtime\n\nThere are plenty of picnic tables by the parking lot and alongside the trail. Grilling is allowed.\n\nSomething Adventurous: Helicopter Ride\n\nAwesome is definitely what comes to mind when describing a helicopter flight over New York City. Wing Air Helicopters offers 45-minute tours leaving from Westchester County Airport, not too far from Monsey. The trip is by no means inexpensive, but it’s certainly one of a kind. Book a late afternoon flight at no extra charge to catch a spectacular sunset over the city.\n\nGetting There\n\nFlights operate out of West Harrison and Purchase, New York.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nChildren under two can fly free sitting on a parent’s lap. Infant headsets are available. Up to six passengers are allowed per flight.\n\nLunchtime\n\nNo food is allowed in the helicopters.\n\nSomething Free: Overpeck County Park\n\nParks are a great way to enjoy the day without spending lots of money, and Overpeck County Park, in Bergen County, New Jersey, features walking paths, kayak and canoe rentals, and a huge playground.\n\nWhen arriving at the park entrance roundabout, make a right and cross over the two wooden bridges. The first parking lot is for Overpeck Park Kayak Center. They rent out canoes, as well as single and tandem kayaks. Kayaking probably won’t be open yet, but there is a scenic walkway alongside the water that leads to the playground. You can also drive to the playground and park there. The playground is huge! There is a large climbing area, a toddler area, swings, a monkey bar area, and the highlight of the park: several 15-foot rope climbing structures with a small trampoline in the center.\n\nGetting There\n\nThe park is about a half an hour away from Brooklyn and Monsey, and an hour from Lakewood.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nYes.\n\nLunchtime\n\nThe grounds have plenty of picnic tables.\n\nSomething for Everyone: Roosevelt Island\n\nThere’s nothing like seeing New York traffic from above! Roosevelt Island is a narrow two-mile-long island in the East River, located between Manhattan and Queens. It can be accessed through the Arial Tramway, near the FDR Highway on the East Side. The tram ride lasts just a couple of minutes but provides a fascinating view of the infamous traffic below. Since it’s part of the New York City transit system, you need a Metro Card to ride. Up to three children under 44 inches tall can ride the tram for free when accompanied by a fare-paying adult.\n\nOnce you get to the island, there is plenty to do: playgrounds geared for different age groups, a walkway alongside the river where you can ride bikes or take a leisurely stroll, and open fields that are great for ball games or flying kites.\n\nGetting There\n\nCatch the Tramway at E. 59th Street and 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. Metro cards can be purchased there.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nYes.\n\nLunchtime\n\nPack along a picnic lunch to eat on the island.\n\nAlthough London is known for its gray weather, it is a city full of rich history and colorful attractions, including the Tower of London, Big Ben, and Buckingham Palace. The city is also home to Stamford Hill, Golders Green, and Edgware — the main neighborhoods where London’s large and diverse frum community lives.\n\nTRIP ADVISOR: Mrs. Dolly Scharf & Mrs. Channi Israel of Shoshanim\n\nShoshanim provides the largest children’s after-school and holiday program in Stamford Hill and has become a brand name to families in the area. Children from 12 different schools participate in after-school homework sessions and extracurricular courses, including first aid, CD productions, and culinary skills. During the winter and summer holidays and before Pesach, approximately 600 children partake in day trips and innovative projects and activities. Mrs. Scharf and Mrs. Israel have been running the program for over 15 years.\n\nSomething Outdoors: Woburn Safari Park\n\nThe Safari is not a cheap expedition, but it offers a day packed with adventure. Take a wild ride through the jungle and watch out for the lions, tigers, zebras, and giraffes. Afterwards you can meander by foot through forests and plains full of monkeys and kangaroos. For the non-animal lovers, there are assorted leisure activities, including a train ride, indoor soft play, boating, and an outdoor playground.\n\nGetting There\n\nThe Safari is about an hour’s drive from London.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nYes.\n\nLunchtime\n\nThis is a full day’s trip, so make sure you bring along plenty of food.\n\nSomething Indoors: The Snow Centre\n\nWith rain perpetually in the forecast, leave it to the English to bring the great outdoors inside. The Snow Centre is an indoor winter sports facility, where visitors can ski or snowboard on manmade snow-covered slopes reminiscent of a Swiss mountainside. Lessons are available for adults, kids, and families; it’s recommended that you book in advance. For the less adventurous, try snow tubing down the Ringo Slide or sledging, the British equivalent of sledding. The facility provides equipment, including helmets and boots, but make sure to bring along warm clothing and waterproof gloves. It’s cold, and yes, the snow is real!\n\nGetting There\n\nThe Snow Centre is located in Hemel Hempstead, near Golders Green, and is accessible by car or public transportation.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nThere is an upper gallery where you can relax and watch the slopes below.\n\nLunchtime\n\nNo. Eat at home.\n\nSomething Child Friendly: Kidzania\n\nHistorical excursions and major adventures aside, here is a trip custom-made for the little ones. Kidzania is a miniature city where kids earn and spend money and learn various trades. Children dress up and train in assorted jobs, from fighting a fire to piloting a simulation airplane to hairstyling at a beauty salon. After opening a bank account and earning cash at his new job, your little tyke can then spend his earnings on various attractions. Kidzania is a favorite with younger kids, up to around age ten. Older kids tend to get bored quickly.\n\nGetting There\n\nKidzania is located in the Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd’s Bush, and is accessible by car and public transportation.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nIt’s stroller-friendly, and there are lifts inside the building.\n\nLunchtime\n\nSome of the activities involve non-kosher food. But they can easily be avoided, and there are plenty of other “jobs” to choose from.\n\nSomething Adventurous: Clip ’n Climb\n\nIf you’re afraid of heights, this jaunt is definitely not for you. But if you’re looking for serious adventure — like rock climbing and a vertical slide drop — get ready to climb, jump, twist, and slide up the walls and through the air at this indoor climbing venue for adults and kids. Climbing sessions are generally around 90 minutes. Equipment and training are provided.\n\nGetting There\n\nClip ’n Climb is located in Chelsea and is accessible via public transportation. There is no on-site parking, but parking may be found in the vicinity.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nChildren age four and above are allowed to climb. There is an upper gallery where non-climbers can view the action. Prams or buggies are not allowed.\n\nLunchtime\n\nNo outside food allowed.\n\nSomething Free: Alexandra Park\n\nYou’ve guessed it: We’re headed off to the local park. Alexandra Park is named after the wife of King Edward VII, Great Britain’s monarch in the early part of the 20th century. It is dominated by Alexandra Palace, which was built in the 1860s in honor of the Danish Princess Alexandra, when she married Prince Edward. The scenic grounds provide plenty of opportunities for picnicking, cricket, and kite flying. The park’s sloping hills offer striking views of London spread out below.\n\nGetting There\n\nLocated in North London, the park is accessible by public transportation.\n\nBaby Friendly?\n\nYes, although some sections of the park are hillier than others.\n\nLunchtime\n\nTake advantage of the ample grounds and pack a picnic lunch."
