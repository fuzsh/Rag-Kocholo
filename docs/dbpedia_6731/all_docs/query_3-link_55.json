        "text": "Israel is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, and tourists from around the world flock to this country to experience the stunning landscapes, historical landmarks, and diverse cultural attractions. One of the very popular activities for domestic and international tourists alike is exploring Israel’s many nature preserves and national parks, which are home to a wide variety of beautiful flowers and plants. Among the many stunning blooms that can be found in Israel, the lupine flower, known locally as Turmus, is a particular favorite, thanks to its striking unique beauty.\n\nLupines are a type of flowering plant that is native to the Mediterranean region, and they are widely cultivated for their colorful and fragrant blooms. In Israel, lupines can be found in many different settings, from the wildflower meadows that dot the countryside to the carefully tended gardens and parks that are scattered throughout the country. Visitors to Israel can expect to see lupines in a range of colors, from deep shades of blue and purple.\n\nOne of the best places that I have experienced Israel’s lupine flowers over the years is in the Shomron region, which is located in the country’s center mountain area. Here, visitors can explore the scenic hiking trails that wind through the region’s rolling hills and valleys, taking in the stunning views of the surrounding landscape and the vibrant lupine blooms that carpet the hillsides. Other popular destinations for lupine spotting include the Carmel Mountains and the upper Galilee region in the north which are home to a wide range of native plant species. But don’t miss the remarkable density of this flower that exists in Jerusalem’s Armon HaNatziv Mitzpeh Tal hilltop lookout points that also provides an incredible panoramic view of Gush Etzion in the with the iconic centerpiece Herodium, and an amazing view of the mountains of Moab in Jordan to the east and to the north a breathtaking of you of all of Jerusalem with the old city in its Center surrounded by the Mount of Olives and the modern city to the west.\n\nOf course, with great natural beauty comes great responsibility, and Israel is committed to protecting its unique and valuable ecosystem. As a result, the country has implemented a range of laws and regulations aimed at protecting endangered and threatened plant species, including many of the flowers and plants that are popular with tourists. These laws cover everything from picking wildflowers to hiking in unmarked trails and hurting the wildlife, and they are administered by Israel’s National Park and Nature Authority.\n\nOne of the most important laws protecting Israel’s flora is the Wildflowers Protection Law, which was first enacted in 1985. This law prohibits the picking or uprooting of wildflowers from their natural habitats, as well as the sale or transport of these flowers without a permit. Violators of this law can face fines, imprisonment, or both, depending on the severity of the offense.\n\nIn addition to the Wildflowers Protection Law, Israel also has a number of regulations in place to protect specific species of plants and flowers. For example, the country’s Red Book of Plants is a comprehensive list of all the threatened and endangered plant species found in Israel, and it provides guidance on how to protect and preserve these species for future generations. Similarly, the Israel Plant Gene Bank is a national repository of seeds and genetic material from native plant species, which is used to ensure the long-term survival of these species in the face of environmental threats.\n\nOverall, Israel’s commitment to protecting its natural heritage is admirable, and it is a testament to the country’s deep connection to its land and its people. By protecting its beautiful flowers and other natural treasures, Israel is ensuring that future generations will be able to enjoy these wonders for years to come. Whether you’re a seasoned botanist or simply a lover of natural beauty, a visit to Israel’s lupine-filled gardens, parks or open spaces is an experience you won’t soon forget.\n\n—- David Ha’ivri is a professional tour guide based in Jerusalem, Israel.
