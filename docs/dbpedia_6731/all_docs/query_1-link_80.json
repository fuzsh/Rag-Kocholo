        "text": "JERUSALEM: Israel has conducted a systematic policy of prisoner abuse and torture since the start of the Gaza war, subjecting Palestinian detainees to acts ranging from arbitrary violence to sexual abuse, Israeli rights group B'Tselem said in a report.\n\nIt said the report, issued on Monday, was based on interviews with 55 Palestinians from Gaza, the West Bank and Israel detained in Israeli prisons since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that set off the war, most of them without being tried.\n\n\"The testimonies clearly indicate a systematic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,\" the report said.\n\nThe Israeli military, which runs some detention facilities where Palestinian prisoners have been held, said that it operated according to the rule of law and any specific claims of abuse were investigated.\n\n\"The IDF categorically rejects allegations of systematic abuse, including sexual abuse, in its detention facilities,\" it said, adding that monitoring mechanisms were in place to ensure facilities were run in accordance with the law.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service said that all prisoners were treated according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.\n\n\"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" the spokesperson said, adding that detainees had the right to file complaints that would be fully examined and investigated.\n\nThe B'Tselem report was issued days after the Israeli military detained nine soldiers accused of severe abuse of a prisoner in a military facility in the Negev desert. Israeli press reports said the soldiers were accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit.\n\nThe report detailed allegations that Palestinian prisoners were subjected to arbitrary beatings, degrading and humiliating treatment and sleep deprivation, as well as \"the repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity\".\n\n\"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,\" it said.\n\n'Utter humiliation'\n\nFathiyeh Abu Mousa said the treatment she received was routinely humiliating and that she was held in handcuffs and chains even as she was being released from detention in July without charges being laid.\n\n\"The food is very bad and they give it to us in a humiliating manner,\" she told Reuters. \"They gave us two meals a day, no clothes or shampoo to bathe or shower. My face flared up with a rash from the mattress. It was utter humiliation there.\"\n\nAllegations of prisoner abuse have surfaced repeatedly during the Gaza war, adding to mounting international pressure on Israel over its conduct of the 10-month-old conflict.\n\nThe report from B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the direction of the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nThe prison service spokesperson said that since the Oct. 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered that prison conditions be made more strict to reverse an improvement in conditions allowed previously.\n\nQadura Fares, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Detainees Affairs, reiterated a call for an international commission of inquiry into the treatment of prisoners to hold Israel accountable.\n\n\"We have documentation of the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinian detainees in its prisons and we have horrific testimonies of what detainees are subjected to, whether related to torture, rape and other crimes,\" he said.\n\nCAIRO: Israeli forces pressed on with their operations near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Monday amid an international push for a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and block a slide into a wider regional conflict with Iran and its proxies.\n\nPalestinian medics said Israeli military strikes on several areas of Khan Younis on Monday killed at least 16 people and wounded several. Meanwhile more families and displaced persons streamed out of areas threatened by new evacuation orders telling people to clear the area.\n\nAs fighting continued in several areas of the Gaza Strip, Hamas reacted skeptically to the latest round of Egyptian and Qatari-brokered talks due on Thursday, saying it has seen no sign of movement from the Israeli side.\n\nThe group said in a statement on Sunday mediators must force Israel to accept a ceasefire proposal based on ideas by US President Joe Biden, which Hamas had accepted, “instead of pursuing further rounds of negotiations or new proposals that would provide cover for the occupation’s aggression.”\n\nTwo sources close to Hamas said the group was convinced the new call for talks was coordinated beforehand with Israel to deter responses from Iran and Hezbollah to the assassination of the group’s chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a top Hezbollah leader in Lebanon.\n\n“It is a mild rejection you can say. Should Hamas receive a workable plan, an Israeli positive response to the proposal it had accepted, things may change, but so far Hamas believes Netanyahu isn’t serious about reaching a deal,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation effort.\n\nHamas’ reaction to the talks came as preparations for a larger scale confrontation grew, with Washington ordering a guided missile submarine to the Middle East and the Abraham Lincoln strike group accelerating its deployment to the region.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that Iran was making preparations for a large-scale military attack on Israel, Barack Ravid, a normally well-sourced reporter for Axios News reported on Twitter.\n\nIsrael has been braced for a major attack since last month when a missile strike killed 12 youngsters in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel responded by killing a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.\n\nA day after that operation, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran, drawing Iranian vows of retaliation against Israel.\n\nThe potential escalation underlined how far the Middle East has been thrown into turmoil by the war in Gaza, now into its 11th month.\n\nThe Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip killed some 1,200 people, with more than 250 taken into captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies, in one of the most devastating blows against Israel in its history.\n\nIn response, Israeli forces have flattened Gaza, displaced most of the population and killed around 40,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, in a war that has caused horror around the world.\n\nOn Saturday, scores of people were killed in Israeli strikes on a school building in Gaza City that the military said targeted fighters from the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nGaza health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians but Israel says at least a third are fighters. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza.\n\nTEHRAN: Iran’s former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with major would powers, on Monday announced he had resigned from his new post as vice president.\n\n“I resigned from the position of vice president for strategic affairs last week,” Zarif said in post on X, less than two weeks after the newly-elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian chose him as his deputy.\n\nZarif cited several reasons for his resignation, most notably his disappointment with the line-up in the newly-proposed 19-member cabinet.\n\n“I am ashamed that I could not implement, in a decent way, the expert opinion of the committees (responsible for selecting candidates) and achieve the inclusion of women, youth and ethnic groups, as I had promised,” he said.\n\nPezeshkian on Sunday presented his cabinet, which included one woman, to parliament for approval.\n\nThe proposed list drew criticism from some among Iran’s reformist camp, including over the inclusion of conservatives from the government of late president Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nZarif pointed out that he also faced pressure after his appointment as vice president because his children hold US citizenship.\n\n“My message... is not a sign of regret or disappointment with dear Dr. Pezeshkian or opposition to realism; rather it means doubting my usefulness as a vice president for strategic affairs,” he said, noting he would return to academia and focus less on Iran’s domestic politics.\n\nZarif, who was Iran’s top diplomat between 2013 and 2021 in the government of moderate president Hassan Rouhani, became known on the international stage during the lengthy negotiations for the 2015 accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\nThe deal was effectively torpedoed three years later when then-president Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed crippling sanctions on the Islamic republic.\n\nBut it made Zarif a figurehead for a more open, outward-looking Iran that Pezeshkian pledged to strive for during his campaign, during which he was frequently joined by the former top diplomat.\n\nKASSALA: Amna Hussein sat grieving in a disaster relief tent in eastern Sudan, where she fled with her children after deadly floods displaced thousands in a country already reeling from war.\n\n“My father died in the floods,” Hussein said in Kassala, a state on the border with Eritrea.\n\nSudan has experienced an intense rainy season since last month, with intermittent torrential flooding mainly in the country’s north and east.\n\nAuthorities have not released an updated death toll, but 34 people have died in the northern town of Abu Hamad alone, according to the Sudanese Red Crescent.\n\n“All our houses have collapsed. Mine has been totally destroyed. We’re sitting in the street with nowhere to go,” flood victim Umm Ayman Zakarya Adam told AFP in Abu Hamad.\n\nAuthorities in Kassala on Friday issued an “urgent call” to the international community, asking for “immediate assistance to rescue victims” of the flooding.\n\nThey said that in Kassala “thousands of people have been affected by the floods which have destroyed many homes.”\n\nEvery year between May and October peak flow on the Nile is accompanied by torrential rains, destroying homes, wrecking infrastructure and claiming lives, both directly and through water-borne diseases.\n\nThe impact is expected to be worse this year after nearly 16 months of fighting that has displaced millions of people into flood zones.\n\nIn Wadi Halfa, in the north of the country, near the Egyptian border, “around 3,000 homes and health facilities were severely damaged,” according to local authorities.\n\n“I’m speaking to you from a hilltop where my family and dozens of others took shelter last night after we were completely surrounded by rising waters,” said Mohammed Othman, a resident of Wadi Halfa, speaking to AFP by phone.\n\nFlood-hit communities\n\nMore than 73,000 Sudanese have been affected by the floods, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nAmong those, over 21,000 have been displaced and 14,300 had their homes destroyed.\n\nIn Kassala, despite health authorities spraying insecticide at the displacement camps, an AFP journalist reported that swarms of flies were making living conditions even more difficult for the displaced.\n\nA doctor in Kassala, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported a rise in cases of diarrhea, particularly among children.\n\nMedical worker have said this may indicate a rise in cholera, which health authorities have struggled to control with the war decimating Sudan’s health care system.\n\nSince April of last year, a war between the Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displaced millions of people both within and outside of Sudan.\n\nBoth sides are accused of war crimes, including the deliberate targeting of civilians and blocking of aid, worsening the country’s already stark humanitarian crisis.\n\nAccording to the UN, more than 260,000 people have been displaced to Kassala state by the war.\n\nMassive displacement\n\nOmar Babiker and his family took refuge in Kassala after the RSF arrived on their doorstep in Sudan’s central Al-Jazira state.\n\nThe floods forced Babiker to move again to a camp for the displaced, where he is still vulnerable to the rains.\n\n“The floods caught up with us when the waters surrounded our tents,” he told AFP.\n\nIn Aroma, a town 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the east of Kassala, floods submerged entire houses, forcing residents to take refuge on a roadside.\n\nHumanitarian organizations have warned that the rainy season could isolate entire regions, making rescue efforts even more difficult.\n\n“Some have been displaced three or four times since the start of the conflict. They have lost their belongings, including food rations,” said Olga Sarrado, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).\n\nThey “are facing significant challenges in accessing clean water and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases,” she added.\n\nTo the west of Kassala, white tents stretch out over five square kilometers (two square miles).\n\n“These tents don’t protect us from the rain,” said Fathiya Mohammed, a displaced mother trying to light a fire despite the ever-present dampness.\n\nLike others in her situation, Mohammed counts on a single daily meal distributed by a kitchen staffed by volunteers.\n\n“We know it’s not enough, but it’s all we can provide,” a volunteer said.\n\nFRANKFURT: German airline group Lufthansa said Monday it was extending the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran, Beirut, Amman and Irbil through to August 21 because of continued tensions in the region.\n\nIt said it would also avoid using Iranian and Iraqi airspace until August 21, an extension from a previous date of August 13.\n\nAffected passengers can rebook or cancel their journeys free of charge, Lufthansa said, adding that it regretted the inconvenience caused “due to the current situation.”\n\nAlso on Monday, Air France and its subsidiary Transavia France again extended the suspension of their flights to Beirut, through Wednesday August 14.\n\nThe flights have been suspended since July 29 and their resumption “will be subject to a new assessment of the situation on the ground,” Air France said in a statement. The French carrier continues to serve Tel Aviv’s airport.\n\nOther airlines have also modified their flight schedules in the region recently.\n\nTensions have soared as Iran and its allies vowed revenge for the high-profile killings of Hezbollah’s top military commander Fuad Shukr in Lebanon and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran late last month, both blamed on Israel.\n\nHezbollah has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israeli forces across the border between Lebanon and Israel."
