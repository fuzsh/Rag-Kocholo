        "text": "Efrat Shvily’s New Homes in Israel and the Occupied Territories is a series of black-and-white photographs of houses and suburban neighborhoods that sometimes faintly echo the forms of “the ideal city.”\n\nThe disconnection of the buildings from their surroundings points to the problematic relationship between the Israelis and their land. The series arose in response to the large number of Jewish settlements that were realized in Israel and in the Occupied Territories in the 1990s.\n\nThe New Homes series was part of the exhibition [based upon] True Stories at Witte de With (January 24 – March 30, 2003).\n\nIn June 2003, the first book by Efrat Shvily, titled Palestinian Cabinet Ministers, 2000 was published by Witte de With."
