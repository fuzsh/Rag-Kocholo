        "text": "By bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are numerous bus routes from Jerusalem (near the Central Bus Station) to Gush Etzion. They are generally armored, so you do not have to worry about possible sniper fire targeting Israelis in the West Bank. The fare from Jerusalem is always about ₪7. Some of the more important routes are as follows:\n\n380/381/382 - runs down route 60 (the main north-south road in Gush Etzion and the West Bank as a whole) on the way to Hebron, stopping at each junction along the way. It is the most frequent route (several times an hour), and the fastest, if your destination is close to route 60. However, most places in Gush Etzion are not in walking distance. Efrat's southern entrance is 5 minutes walk from road 60, but most of Efrat is not within walking distance of the southern entrance. The only settlements that are adjacent to the road are Elazar and Alon Shevut.\n\n361/362/364 - go into all the small settlements west of route 60. This can make for a long nauseating ride if you're towards the end of the route. Looking out the window rather than at your phone can help with the nausea. Frequency is about hourly.\n\n367/369/377 - runs the length of Efrat. Frequency is about hourly.\n\nBesides the Central Bus Station, these routes stop at the Malcha mall and the trempiada (the southernmost intersection before leaving Jerusalem, in the Gilo neighborhood, officially known as Tzomet HaMinharot) before leaving Jerusalem.\n\nUntil 2017, these routes had numbers in the 160s (such as 160 and 167), so don't get confused by references to the old numbers.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you don't have a car, the fastest, cheapest and easiest travel option is hitchhiking, or in Israeli English, \"to catch a tremp\". Any time between 6am and 1am, you're likely to be picked up by a kippah-wearing, smiling nice guy which will take you for the 12-20 minutes ride to Gush Etzion.\n\nThe main hitchhiking hub is in the southern exit from Jerusalem, a place called \"Tzomet HaMinharot\", or informally the trempiada. Get on any Jerusalem local bus that reaches the Gilo neighborhood (buses # 30,31,32,71,72), and ask any of the passengers for directions to the Trempiada.\n\nYou will notice a large group of people waiting on the other side of the road. That's who you're looking for. The rule is first come - first serve, so don't push. On the other hand, don't be too soft. The tremps will stop in the bay, and the driver will announce his destination.\n\nThere are two entrances to Efrat, so drivers to Efrat will say which one they'll be entering from, the southern entrance (\"Efrat Darom\") or the Northern Entrance (\"Efrat Tzafon\"). Another common destination is Tzomet HaGush, the road junction at the center of Gush Etzion. From here you can get another tremp to a specific settlement, although many Israelis consider it unsafe to hitchhike here (in the past, it has been the site of kidnappings and shootings by Palestinians). But you don't need to risk this: if you wait a bit longer at the Jerusalem trempiada, someone will likely come for your specific settlement.\n\nWhen you enter the car, say \"Todah\" (Thank you), buckle up, and switch your cell phone to vibrate. Try not to talk during the ride, unless the driver initiates the conversation - they might not enjoy a stranger's background noise during their daily commute. When getting off, make sure you took your belongings, and thank the driver once again. There is no need to pay him/her.\n\nFrom Beit Shemesh, hitchhiking is easiest, but the 409 bus also runs several times a day."
