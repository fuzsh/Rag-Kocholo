        "text": "Jerusalem, city of Gold is the MOST talked about city in the world! The capital of Israel, the “City of Peace”, One can find all types of people it’s a melting pot of people, from the Jewish Quarter of the Old City to trendy Katamon and Baka, suburban Har Nof and Pisgat Zeev, and eclectic Nachlaot, Jerusalem has something for everyone. The diverse community and lifestyle options mean that you can find everything from a home in a quiet residential street to an apartment that’s right in the middle of busy, city life. Whatever neighborhood you choose, you are sure to be surrounded by fascinating sights, interesting people and all of the amenities of any modern city. Meet the Anglo’s who are now living in Jerusalem, Israel\n\nIn addition to being one of the biggest neighborhoods in Jerusalem, Ramot (Hebrew for “heights”) is also one of the most diverse. The six sections of Ramot differ wildly from one another, just as the 40,000 people who live there come from a wide variety of backgrounds. What they share is the panoramic view, because Ramot was built hundreds of meters above sea level. Ramot is one of the newer Jerusalem neighborhoods, as construction first began in the 1970s. The different sections of Ramot were built by different architects and for differing purposes. Ramot Aleph (or Ramot One) was built for families of moderate income. The result is an area of attached, tiered apartment buildings, which together resemble a giant beehive.\n\nResidents of these apartments tend to be Orthodox Jews with large families, even though the apartments themselves are not that big. In sharp contrast, Ramot Bet (Ramot Two) boasts rows of spacious private homes. Living in a private house, and in particular an unattached house, is a luxury in Jerusalem, where the majority of people live in apartments.\n\nRamot Bet is therefore known as a prosperous neighborhood, populated mainly with a mix of Modern Orthodox and secular Jews. Many English-speaking immigrants choose to live in Ramot Bet, since the lifestyle is similar to that which they left behind. The remaining four neighborhoods of Ramot present variations of the spectrum between these two extremes.\n\nRamot Six, for example, is comprised of private homes, but most of these are attached and not as large as the houses in Ramot Bet.\n\nAre you an Oleh or perhaps for looking for a new community in Israel? Let’s talk about Netanya, City Center – for everyone who loves the City & the sea – Netanya could be your next community! Netanya is the largest city in the Sharon area and one of the most beautiful, is a desirable tourist city, rightfully known as “The Israeli Riviera”. Offering green parks and nature reserves, one of the most advanced sports stadiums in Europe, Museums, galleries and a wide range of cultural events. A magnificent 14-km coastal strip boasting 10 well-kept and attractive beaches. The famous “Winter Puddle,” a rare 74-acre nature reserve in an urban landscape. The green and open Iris Reserve, all these make Netanya an attractive real estate and tourist city where its residents enjoy an endless vacation atmosphere. Come and hear what the locals have to say about living in Netanya and learn about an exciting new real estate project – Savyon City, the new luxury tower from famed developers Africa Israel Residence!\n\nIr Yamim is a large area in the southwestern part of Netanya, built with the sea as its focal point. Proximity to the sea assures its success, according to real estate developers. Netanya is the favorite destination for many overseas residents who want a holiday home in Israel; it is located in the center of the country and is a seaside town. In relation to the total population, Netanya has the largest number of overseas residents. According to rough estimates, it has an overseas population of nearly 9 percent, most of whom have a house or an apartment that they use as a holiday home. Ir Yamim was designed with these people in mind. Its high-standard design and construction has much in common with the modern architectural motifs of Mediterranean seaside towns. Ir Yamim has nature on three sides: to the west, the Mediterranean Sea; to the south, the Poleg Nature Reserve; and to the east, the Irusim Nature Reserve. The buildings are designed so that the maximum number of apartments have sea views. As is typical of a quality development near the sea, the dwellings are not cheap – and they’re not meant to be. The closer an apartment in Ir Yamim is to the seashore, the more it costs."
