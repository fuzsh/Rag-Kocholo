        "text": "“Always keep in mind the existence of those individuals, whether relatives or great friends, who believe that reality must adapt to their immediate impulses and desires. Those who created opportunities to hurt you, and then find it funny to watch your pain, sometimes pointing it out to others, instead of protecting your privacy and helping you comfort yourself.”\n\n― Efrat Cybulkiewicz\n\n“I have lived in many places, and I have met many people, but only a few have appreciated me, for who I am, selflessly... these people I remember the most.”\n\n― Efrat Cybulkiewicz\n\n“Whenever i find myself losing faith in humanity, i come back to the classical music. They are a great reminder that we are also able to produce beautiful things made out of strong and barely controllable emotions.”\n\n― Efrat Cybulkiewicz\n\n“Loan me a canvas and I will let down my guard. Loan me a paintbrush and I will reach into my soul. Loan me jars full of colors and I will submerge in a sea of possibilities. Loan me the time and you will see infinite versions of my being re-born.”\n\n― Efrat Cybulkiewicz\n\n“Every form of life communicates. Listen. There is something fascinating about Distance, it keeps more mysteries than we could digest in a lifetime, although at some level it represents an abstraction, it is so palpable that it is even experienced in the skin. Possibly a long stretch (gap, interval, or space) that protects us but through which we extend a strong bond, which ends up linking us with that something that seems to be beyond our range, or perhaps, has been all the time within us, waiting to be discovered. Guessing, the mere fact of thinking about Distance carries an insinuating load, which attracts, or perhaps emanates, complex emotions. Thus giving this thought a function, an intention, a direction, life, and purpose.”\n\n― Efrat Cybulkiewicz"
