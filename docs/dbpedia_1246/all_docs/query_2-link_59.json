        "text": "Balázs Szokolay is an all-round outstanding talent among the young generation playing folk music. As a self-taught talent he became one of the most virtuoso saxophone, clarinet, recorder players in Hungary. He is interested in all forms of traditional music in the Carpathian-region, but also free jazz and contemporary music.\n\nDue to his open-mindedness and flexibility, he performs in bands of very different characters, as the Vasmalom, the Kampec Dolores, or the Dél-Alföldi Szaxofonegyüttes."
