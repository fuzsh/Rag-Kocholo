        "text": "Natascha and Nigel have collaborated their classical/jazz backgrounds to form a unique duo transcribing and re-arranging some of their favourite music for clarinet and accordion.\n\nNatascha completed her Bachelor of Music Diploma at the Sydney Conservatorium and then spent 17 years studying and freelancing with orchestras and as a soloist in Munich and London before returning to Sydney with her family and three daughters.\n\nShe has performed with orchestras like Opera Australia, Sydney Chamber Opera and in recent years tutored at the SYO Summer Schools. Natascha has over 30 years of teaching experience and is currently full-time staff at Ascham School.\n\nNigel started playing accordion at the age of 7 but gave it up soon after in favour of the trumpet which he studied through to tertiary level, attaining his Associate Diploma in Jazz Studies at the Sydney Conservatorium. He has over 30 years of teaching and freelance playing with various big bands, rock & roll bands and jazz ensembles.\n\nIn his early twenties, it was The Buddy Holly show that gave him a role playing the accordion, and the instrument that had been in its case for far too long began to be played at jazz gigs with The Moods Band.\n\nIn the past 5 years Nigelâs interest in French and alpine music has seen him play regularly at the German beer halls, cafes, markets and French breakfasts at private schools.\n\nNigel currently teaches trumpet from his home studio and over the past 3 years conducted the bands at Balgowlah North Public together with his wife."
