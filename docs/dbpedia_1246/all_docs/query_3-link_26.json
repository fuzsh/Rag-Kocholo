Yes, that divine calm: there are no questions, merely the certainty of the flow of notes. The perfect ground for contemplation. As a Franciscan monk, Porta knew all about meditation. He knew about timeless prayer, and may well have been touched by shining quietude, for he dedicated his life to it. (...) Porta is dear to my heart, I confess, and it surprises me even today how neglected he is in musical life. This album thus meets a long-awaited need.
