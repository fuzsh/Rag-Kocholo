The Archbishop of Armagh is an archiepiscopal title which takes its name from the city of Armagh in Northern Ireland. Since the Reformation, there have been parallel apostolic successions to the title: one in the Roman Catholic Church and the other in the Church of Ireland. The archbishop of each denomination also holds the title of Primate of All Ireland.

In the Church of Ireland, the archbishop is John McDowell, who is the ecclesiastical head of the Church of Ireland and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Armagh.[1] He was elected as archbishop in March 2020 and translated to the role on 28 April 2020.[2][3]
