A sophisticated system of ecclesiastical courts, working subject to the archbishop, is revealed. A picture of an entire society, its organization and its mentality, emerges from the accounts of dispossessed priests, illegally married couples, forgers, perjurers and a myriad of litigants and offenders who came before the officials of the courts to reveal their stories and make amends for their faults."
