        "text": "Architect, of Armagh, Drogheda and Dublin. Francis Johnston was born in Armagh in 1760, the second son by the first marriage of WILLIAM JOHNSTON[1] WILLIAM JOHNSTON[1] , architect and builder in Armagh, and younger brother of RICHARD JOHNSTON[1]. RICHARD JOHNSTON[1]. The Johnstons, originally from Scotland, settled in Armagh in the seventeenth century, and Francis Johnston's great-grandfather, another William, was present at the siege of Derry. Francis Johnston probably attended the Royal School in Armagh, which was under the patronage of Richard Robinson, Archbishop of Armagh. In 1778 the Archbishop sent Johnston to Dublin to become a pupil of his architect THOMAS COOLEY THOMAS COOLEY . Johnston remained with Cooley until 1782, when he entered the office of SAMUEL SPROULE SAMUEL SPROULE , who appears to have been a relation. After the death of Cooley early in 1784, Johnston was appointed his successor as architect to Archbishop Robinson's building projects in Armagh. He also carried out works for the archbishop on his estates at Dunleer in Co. Louth, and was involved in the design of Rokeby Hall, the archbishop's new house at Dunleer. During the ten years between 1784 and 1794 Johnston appears to have lived in - or near - Drogheda, where he was responsible for a number of buildings. He received the Freedom of Drogheda on 8 October 1787. Following the Archbishop's death in October 1794, Johnston moved to Dublin, though much of his work was still in north Leinster. This included the commission from Blayney Townley Balfour to design Townley Hall, near Drogheda, generally considered to be Johnston's masterpiece. In March and April 1796 he made a tour of England and Wales, which he recorded in a diary.\n\nBy the early years of the new century, Johnston was well established in Dublin. He won two important competitions: for the new church of St George in Hardwicke Place in 1801 and for the conversion of the Irish Parliament House into the Bank of Ireland in 1803. He was officially appointed architect to the Bank of Ireland on 30 May 1803 and the following year he was allowed an assistant. He continued to be paid by the bank until 1825 or 1826. In 1805 he was appointed architect to the Board of Works in succession to ROBERT WOODGATE ROBERT WOODGATE . His work for the Board, though often very minor, included the Chapel Royal at Dublin Castle, 1807-14, and the General Post Office, 1814-18. JAMES SHIEL JAMES SHIEL may have been a clerk in his office during the earlier part of this period. In 1822 his cousin WILLIAM MURRAY WILLIAM MURRAY was appointed his assistant; the following year he was said to be ill with a rheumatic complaint. He retired on half pay in 1826 and was replaced by Murray on 14 February 1827. As architect to the Commissioners for the Erection of Lunatic Asylums, it was with Murray that he designed the general plan for the new asylums which were erected during the 1820s in Belfast, Carlow, Armagh and Derry.\n\nBy the end of his career Johnston was a wealthy man. He formed a collection of paintings, sculpture, books, objets d'art and curiosities, which became well-known and was much visited. He was generous in his benefactions, which included the gift of a peal of eight bells to St George's Church. He was one of the fourteen founder members of the the Royal Hibernian Academy, incorporated in 1821, and succeeded William Ashford as president in 1824. At his own expense he designed and built the Academy's premises in Abbey Street, which he leased to the Academy in perpetuity for a nominal rent. The building was destroyed by fire in 1916; only the upper storeys of the fa√ßade survive (2008).\n\nJohnston died on 14 March 1829 and was buried in the burial ground of St George's Church in Whitworth Road, Drumcondra, in a simple grave which he is said to have designed himself. He has been described as delicate in constitution, lame, and retiring in manner. He had married in 1790 Anne, a daughter of Robert Barnes, a prosperous and well-connected Armagh man, from whom she inherited property in Dublin. There were no children of the marriage. The year after her husband's death, Anne Johnston paid for the addition of a sculpture gallery to the Royal Hibernian Academy's premises. She survived her husband until 1841. FITZGIBBON LOUCH FITZGIBBON LOUCH , whose family was friendly with the Johnstons, remembered accompanying his grandmother as a child to the 'splendid mansion' of the widowed Mrs Johnston, where 'each room was fitted as a museum' and there was 'a peal of Joy bells in the tower at the end of a large garden at the river - which was the stable offices'.\n\nJohnston's movable property has been dispersed in various sales, the first being held in Dublin 24 March-5 April 1845. Other Johnston property was sold at Kilmore, Co. Armagh, the seat of George Hamilton Johnston, a collateral descendant, in June 1920, and later by his son, Richard Graves Johnston. A list of Johnston's library is in the Royal Irish Academy. A bust of Johnston by EDWARD SMYTH EDWARD SMYTH and JOHN SMYTH JOHN SMYTH is in the Ulster Museum; a plaster cast of this bust was presented to the RIAI by ALBERT EDWARD MURRAY ALBERT EDWARD MURRAY in 1924. The portrait by Thomas Clement Thompson which was engraved by H. Meyer in 1823 is also in the Ulster Museum, as is a group portrait of Johnston, his wife and two nephews by Martin Cregan. The portraits of Johnston and his wife by Cregan which were in the Royal Hibernian Academy were destroyed in the fire of 1916. According to the DNB, Johnston was also drawn or painted by the miniaturist, William Comerford.\n\nJohnston subscribed for sixteen copies of William Stitt's The Practical Architect's Ready Assistant; or Builder's Complete Companion (Dublin, 1819), which was dedicated to him by Stitt as the person 'who first inculcated to my young mind, the early and salutary lesson of improvement in my profession'.\n\nIn addition to William Murray, Johnston's pupils and assistants included FREDERICK DARLEY [2] FREDERICK DARLEY [2] and JOHN WILLIAMSON [1]. JOHN WILLIAMSON [1].\n\nThe Irish Architectural Archive holds a large body of Johnston's architectural drawings in the Murray Collection (Acc.92/46) as well as two plans of Glanmore Castle, 1803,(Acc.88/90) and a design for a portico at Ballycurry, 1810 (Acc. 78/36.B2). It also owns Johnston's copy of Placido Columbani's New Book of Ornaments (1775) , which appears in the 1843 sale catalogue (Acc. 77/6.1).\n\nAddresses: Work: Lower Castle Yard, 1820-1827.\n\nHome: 6 Eccles Street, 1795-1807; 34 Eccles Street, 1808-20; 48 Eccles Street, 1821-23; 55 Eccles Street, 1824-27.\n\nSee WORK and BIBLIOGRAPHY.
