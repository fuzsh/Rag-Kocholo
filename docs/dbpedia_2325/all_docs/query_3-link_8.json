        "text": "Pope Francis emphasizes the importance of praying for political leaders, inviting us to join him in praying for this intention this month.\n\nIn the video accompanying his message, produced by his Worldwide Prayer Network, the Pope reminds us that we cannot “move ahead toward universal fraternity without good politics,” and to be grateful for “the many politicians who carry out their duties with a will to serve, not of power, who put all their efforts toward the common good.”\n\nEven though “politics doesn’t have a very good reputation” today, Pope Francis invites us to see politics as “one of the highest forms of charity,” in search of the common good.\n\nBy the Pope’s Worldwide Prayer Network (Apostolate of Prayer): https://www.popesprayer.va\n\nTo see other videos and content about the Pope’s prayer intentions, go to: https://www.thepopevideo.org/\n\n2\n\n'... we still have the\n\ntraining wheels on our bicycles ...'\n\nJulieann Moran @synodalpathway discusses the pathway towards a Synodal Church, ahead of the next session in Rome this October of the #SynodonSynodality\n\nJulieann Moran is the General Secretary of the Synodal Pathway of the Catholic Church in Ireland.\n\nFor more info - https://www.synod.ie/\n\n1\n\nThe Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem HB Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa reflects on the situation in the Holy Land since the 7 Oct attacks. While not optimistic, he holds on to hope which he sees as having a purpose in the midst of the suffering.\n\n11\n\nJustin Kilcullen, the former Exec Director of Trócaire 1993 -2013, while speaking at IEC2012 in Dublin, reflected on what drew him to join Trócaire in 1981.\n\n'... was that from the outset it had been given this justice mandate by the Irish bishops, who on its foundation had said it is our Christian duty to demand that the political authorities always act with justice and responsibility towards the less fortunate countries.'\n\n0\n\nJulieann Moran looks back at the progress of the synodal pathway for the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Universal Synod on the theme of synodality called by Pope Francis.\n\nSee Synod.ie for all videos and documents featured in this video produced by iCatholic\n\n10"
