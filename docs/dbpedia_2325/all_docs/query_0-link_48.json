It also probes how the new dominance of the Protestants was exercised, what it meant throughout the island, and what were its limitations. Alongside the activities of the governors in Dublin Castle and the nearby parliament, the seemingly humdrum business of ruling the localities is investigated in detail not before attempted. The study necessarily rests heavily on records left by the privileged Protestants. However, these are used to investigate neglected aspects of daily life in the provinces. Much of the text deals with official institutions and those who manned them. Through the officials and their activities, it is possible to recover something of the impact of the British state in Ireland, even on the majority of inhabitants who lacked formal opportunities to participate in public ventures. Accordingly, the strengths and weaknesses of the confessional state erected in Ireland in the late seventeenth century, and maintained for almost a century thereafter, are revealed.\n\nvii\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1: Land and Peoples\n\nIreland before 1641 The English intention to rule Ireland had first been acted on when (in 1169) Henry II, king of England and duke of Normandy, was authorized by the pope to invade and annexe the island. Until the sixteenth century, English control waxed and waned. During those centuries, its authority seldom extended beyond the capital, Dublin, a narrow corridor of land around Dublin and the eastern seaboard (known as the Pale from the ditch which demarcated its boundary), and a few ports strung along the coast, such as Waterford, Cork, Drogheda and Limerick. In 1541, worries over security made Henry VIII’s advisers assert English authority in Ireland more aggressively. This aggression matched similar initiatives in the north and far west of England and in Wales. The most legible sign was an act, devised in England and passed by the Dublin parliament, which declared Henry VIII king of Ireland. Before this, he and his predecessors were styled simply as the lords of Ireland. The act for the kingly title of 1541 announced an ambition: to bring Ireland completely under English rule and to turn it into a provincial dependency little different from northern and western England or Wales. Distance, an unwillingness of England to spend heavily on the venture, the interference of other European states, and – above all – the distinctive cultures and attitudes of the inhabitants of Ireland conspired to defeat the scheme. Notwithstanding the setbacks, reputation obliged successive English monarchs to persist with efforts to subject Ireland. Moreover, arguments of security warned that England itself would never be safe so long as Ireland eluded proper control. The Tudors and Stuarts were surrounded\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nby potential and actual enemies: pretenders to their thrones and rivals among continental monarchs. Ireland offered ground from which troublemakers might assault England. Accordingly, the troublesome and costly English engagement with Ireland continued. Throughout the sixteenth century, and into the seventeenth, efforts were concentrated on trying to extend the systems of English law and administration deeper into the Irish provinces. The creation of shires throughout the kingdom was followed by the introduction of law courts – assizes and quarter sessions – in each. From the 1530s, the danger of Ireland either being wrested from English control or used as a base to destabilize the Tudor or Stuart monarchy became intertwined with the question of religion. Once the Tudors had opted for Protestantism as their state religion, they had to impose it across all their territories. By the end of the sixteenth century, this had been accomplished throughout much of England and portions of Wales, but notoriously not in Ireland. The stubborn devotion of Ireland to Catholicism challenged the contemporary axiom that religious disunity within any state risked serious destabilization. Before 1641, English progress towards its goals in Ireland was erratic and disappointing. Methods alternated between minimalism, recommended as cheap and less likely to provoke local uproar, and force. The recalcitrance of many local leaders – landowners, priests and lawyers – expressed itself through obstruction in the occasional parliaments, non-cooperation in the localities and (more rarely) in open rebellion. Conspiracies and uprisings strengthened the hands of those impatient with conciliation, and keen on rougher methods. If, as seemed the case, the obstinate Irish would never willingly accept the religion and habits of lowland England, then they should be swept from power and replaced by the tractable. This political thinking chimed well with the economic pressures which were impelling emigrants westwards from England, Scotland and Wales. Ireland had long beckoned to those seeking seasonal work, permanent betterment, or freedom from the constraints of their own communities. The relative ease of sailing across the narrow, although often stormy, waters between Britain and Ireland meant that many from the western margins already knew Ireland and had kindred and connections there. In the sixteenth century, as more from Britain uprooted themselves to try new lives in America, the popularity of Ireland as a destination for the restless also grew. The government and private investors traded on these impulses, and encouraged immigrants to establish themselves on the properties confiscated from the unruly Irish. First, in the Irish midlands – King’s and Queen’s Counties, later known as Laois and\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n3\n\nOffaly – then more widely in the southern province of Munster during the 1580s and most conspicuously in the northern province of Ulster early in the seventeenth century, settlement by Protestants from Britain (and beyond) was promoted. The official schemes supplemented the spontaneous movement of peoples westward into Ireland in search of subsistence or improvement. The resulting settlements seldom achieved the size or economic and social impact that had been desired. Yet, in a few districts – the northern counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down and Londonderry and in south Munster around the towns of Youghal, Tallow, Bandon and Kinsale – changes were apparent. By 1641, perhaps 15,000 newcomers from Britain had been attracted into eastern Ulster; and 22,000 into Munster. By 1660 each of the two provinces may have had as many as 30,000 Protestant inhabitants. Thereafter, natural increase among the existing residents added to the stock in Munster. In Ulster, renewed immigration, primarily of Scots, driven out by grim conditions at home, swelled numbers, especially in the 1690s. The landscape took on fresh aspects as English and Scottish styles of building and cultivation were introduced. Houses of stone and lime with chimneys and glazed windows were erected. They were surrounded with orchards, and the holdings fenced, ditched and hedged. Small towns hosted a larger if still restricted range of specialist craftsmen. Forty-six new parliamentary boroughs were incorporated during James’s reign, almost doubling the previous total. More settlers were granted the rights to hold markets and fairs in their townships in the hope that they would stimulate trade and industriousness. Over 500 sites were authorized between 1600 and 1641, but many remained on parchment.1 Not all welcomed the immigrants. Those forced from lands to make way for the newcomers understandably schemed how to regain what had been lost. Even those who had adjusted to – and often profited from – the newcomers watched warily. The government in Ireland, having invited the newcomers, favoured them, treating them as exemplars of Protestantism, industry and civility. Favours included grants of the most fertile and accessible lands, and appointment to local and national offices. By 1641, it was difficult to thrive in this world of English Ireland unless a member of the established Protestant church, the Church of Ireland. Catholics, having for so long controlled property and power, were understandably discomfited. Some converted to Protestantism, but most protested and considered how best to reverse the trends. Notwithstanding the arrival of Protestant immigrants and the pressures on Catholics to embrace\n\n4\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nProtestantism, the percentage of Protestants in the kingdom remained small: hardly 10 per cent before 1641. Without mass defections of the Catholics, natural increase was not likely to transform Ireland into a Protestant kingdom, and so threatened to delay indefinitely that vital precondition for making it peaceful and prosperous.\n\nNatives and New Settlers Two uprisings by the Catholics – during the 1640s and between 1689 and 1691 – challenged the trends. Their failure precipitated further social and economic engineering. On both occasions, the defeated were stripped of property and offices. The redistribution of land in the 1650s, after the Cromwellian reconquest, aimed to introduce approximately 35,000 new proprietors in place of the old. The Catholics’ share of land plummeted. In 1641, they had owned an estimated 59 per cent of the profitable acreage; by 1688, only 22 per cent. Further seizures following a fresh war and further defeats for the Catholics between 1689 and 1691 reduced their total to about 14 per cent. This dramatic change in property-ownership was the basis for the emerging Protestant ascendancy. A few Catholics managed to avoid loss of lands and status. This was easiest west of the River Shannon, in the province of Connacht, but not impossible elsewhere, even in the Pale close to Dublin. The fertile county of Meath was noted at the end of the eighteenth century for a heavy concentration of Catholic notables.2 The exceptions hardly masked the fact that this was a revolution unlike any seen in either England or Wales, or indeed in Scotland, during the period. The dethroning of a long-established élite paralleled what happened in other European counties: for example, in Bohemia after 1620, where Protestants were supplanted by Catholics. In Ireland, the redistribution of property was conceived as the prelude to a more thorough imposition of English manners and religion. Successes were at best patchy and frequently superficial. Fewer than hoped of the new owners came to reside on their estates. A landed élite consisting of 3000 to 5000 families emerged. Absentee owners leased their holdings to others, often on generous terms which allowed the principal tenants to flourish. Most landlords expressed a preference for Protestants as tenants. Except in eastern Ulster, there were too few to permit the exclusive ordinance to be enforced. Catholics were able to rent the farms which once they had owned. Even then, by a law of 1704, they were debarred from taking leases longer than 31 years. Legal trusts allowed these\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n5\n\nprohibitions to be evaded. Ingenuity and subterfuges were required for Catholics to retain even a semblance of the possessions that they enjoyed before 1641, and left them a constant prey to insecurities lest their sleights be discovered and denounced. Ardent Protestants, having willed this situation and enthusiastically backed the seizures of land, questioned the results. By the eighteenth century, it was alleged – but without compelling evidence – that Catholics had consoled themselves for the loss of lands by moving into urban trade.3 The stated intention behind English policy was to rid Ireland of those traditionally identified as subversives: the Irish Catholic magnates, priests, lawyers and soldiers. The corpus of Catholics, having been decapitated, would be content to toil as hewers of wood and drawers of water. And indeed the bulk of the labouring population, whether in countryside or town, was composed of Catholics. At the same time, towns, long conceived as agencies of Protestantism and industry, were to be made into Protestant preserves. The government of chartered boroughs was turned into a Protestant monopoly during the 1650s. This control was eroded in the 1670s and briefly overturned in the 1680s, only to be firmly re-established after 1690. Contemporary wisdom made towns, with their councils and trading guilds, ‘the best school for the vulgar to learn and to practise virtue and public spirit’. By excluding Catholics and (after 1704) rigid Protestant dissenters from full membership, much of the population was debarred from the associational education which might train them in citizenship.4 It was easier to enforce an exclusively Protestant policy on urban office-holding, which was the key to parliamentary representation in the 109 borough and eight county borough constituencies, than in trade and property-owning. Legal barriers had been raised against Catholics owning houses in the strategically important walled towns and ports in the aftermath of the Cromwellian conquest, but these were either lowered or evaded. Nevertheless, Protestants tended to own the most desirable properties in towns, as well as in the countryside. But, just as farms could not be tenanted and worked without Catholics, so few towns outside eastern Ulster would thrive unless they shared trade and work with Catholics. Realists knew that an expulsion of ‘Irish papists’ would lay waste ‘most of our towns and lands which are mostly tenanted by them’.5 Some Catholics clawed their way upwards into the middling ranks. Obliged to be reticent and frugal so as not to attract the attention of vindictive Protestants, they generally crouched in the shadows. Only as an aggregation can the importance of the Catholic town-dwellers be\n\n6\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nsensed. In Dublin, probably by the middle of the eighteenth century, the Protestant preponderance in numbers – itself a product of the 1640s and 1650s – ended. Elsewhere in the island, Catholics had remained a majority notwithstanding the penalties. In 1732, Catholics constituted about two-thirds of the population of Cork city, maybe 70 per cent in Limerick, slightly over three-quarters in Drogheda and perhaps four-fifths in Kilkenny. In the western port of Galway, Protestants may have been no more than one-eighth of the total.6 Catholics tended to be pushed into the poorer districts – often called Irishtowns – beyond the town walls. This tendency can be discerned in Galway in the 1720s. Within the walls, Catholic households constituted 63 per cent of the 343. However, the extramural dwellings divided between 360 Catholics and 75 Protestants. In general, Catholics lived in less commodious houses. In Athlone – within the walls – the average size of the 99 Protestant households was 2.4 hearths; that of the 79 neighbouring Catholic dwellings, 1.7 hearths.7 Even so, in inner Galway, Catholics had houses with an average of three hearths.8 This contrasted with the situation at Limerick, with Galway a traditional Catholic stronghold. There Protestants had a bare majority within the walls, owning 50.7 per cent of the houses. Only 5 per cent of the 539 Catholic houses in intramural Limerick had more than three hearths. The average was 1.6.9 Catholics come into focus chiefly when the authorities harassed them. They were suspected of attachment to the foreign enemies of England or of involvement in local unrest. Their worship, clandestinely practised early in the eighteenth century, but more openly thereafter, helped to define them, both in their own and in their adversaries’ eyes. A fondness for relics, pilgrimages, resort to holy wells and the continuing celebration of festivals were noticed.10 More reticent communal activities, focused on sodalities and confraternities, are harder to spot.11 The traditionalism in the beliefs and behaviour of much of the Catholic laity did not invariably delight their spiritual directors. Priests imbued with the ideals of the counter-reformation and lay-people besotted with the new dogmas of politeness and respectability shuddered at habits which smacked too much of carnival, clannishness, vendetta, riot and superstition. Rifts opened – as in Protestant communities – between the avowed reformers and those content with the customary ways. Sometimes they coincided with divergent political stances: whether to accept the new Protestant order or adhere still to the exiled Stuart dynasty.12 The nuances in Catholic practice interested Protestants less than the resilience of much that was proscribed. By the 1720s, Protestants were aghast that\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n7\n\nstringent laws passed during the previous 30 years were failing to destroy the ordained priesthood or the cult to which it ministered. The cultural differences tended to coincide with and be reinforced by social and economic diversification. Protestant Ireland, estimated to number 300,000 to 400,000, had a gilded pinnacle of the prosperous and professionals, but the solid foundations lay among artisans, cottiers and labourers.13 Neither Catholics nor Protestant dissenters had many high in society, and were disproportionately well represented among the poorer sort. Remote rural areas were, by the late seventeenth century, being drawn more forcefully into a commercial instead of a barter economy. Markets and fairs proliferated. At them, the humble labourer sold what had been garnered – often dairy produce like butter – in the hope of earning enough to pay the rent and buy necessities, such as salt, tobacco, cloth and meal. Beef preserved in barrels and animal skins and fat rendered down into tallow were other staple products in demand among local consumers and as exports. Few required great technological skill or were manufactured. One critic lamented ‘that lazy, sleepy, easy way of getting so much money as will just buy them brogues and sneezing and strong beer’.14 Early in the 1760s, it was reckoned that it took £5 8s 6½d to support a householder in the west for a year. The same household, it was thought, could earn an annual £13. On the Sligo estate of the enquirer who made these calculations, a skilled carpenter was paid 1s 6d daily. Shearers, hired seasonally, received either 10d or 3d each day, depending on age and experience. In contrast, the unskilled hired to cut and save turf and to gravel paths, each received a daily pay of 5d. The least regarded, ‘spalpeen labourers’, were given anything from 2½d to 5d for a day’s toil. In 1772, it was still supposed that peasants earned no more than five to seven old pence for a day’s labour.15 These sums resembled those in rural Wales at much the same date.16 Further east, especially in the towns, better wages were to be had. In Dublin, journeymen in the textile industries agitated for a rise in weekly wages beyond nine shillings. Craftsmen routinely earned a daily 12d, but it could reach double that figure; general labourers, 10d. Skilled needlewomen and dressmakers could make 4s 6d per week.17 However, much of this work was intermittent and even seasonal, so the sums guide imperfectly towards annual incomes among the skilled and laborious. Reformers despaired of the uncertainties when so much employment depended on the vagaries of the weather and the passage of the year. The same uncertainties condemned much of the population to poverty and – notably in the 1720s, 1740s and 1750s – to starvation. Poverty\n\n8\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nlevelled members of the different religious denominations. During the eighteenth century, the numbers and proportion of the population with annual revenues between £5 and £20 slowly increased to 30 per cent. The fortunate minority purchased more commodious housing and more varied food, clothing and furnishings. In these ways, through modes of living and dress, the middle rank differentiated itself more sharply from the drudges and drones. At the same time, even in the 1790s, almost 60 per cent of the population existed on £5 per annum or less.18\n\nIdeas of Government Throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, rulers and ruled argued about the proper relationship between Ireland and Britain. Theories diverged from practices, and this discrepancy often upset the inhabitants of Ireland. The theory, set out in treatises and official declarations, is recovered more easily than what was happening across the island. The lives of those resident in Ireland is the principal theme of this account. However, a brief review of how Ireland was conceived by those who made policy may be helpful. Ireland, ruled by the king (or queen) of England and (after 1603) of Scotland, was described succinctly in 1541 ‘as united and knit to the imperial crown of the realm of England’. Later, in 1689, William and Mary, the new monarchs, were flattered to be told that Ireland was ‘one of the most considerable branches of your mighty empire’, but still a ‘subordinate kingdom to the crown of England’.19 The latter proposition did not go down well in Ireland, where, it was reported in 1709, ‘there is indeed a great reluctancy in all sorts of people here in having it thought that they are a conquered and dependent kingdom’. Despite the Irish misgivings, an act of the Westminster parliament in 1720 announced that the kingdom of Ireland, ‘hath been, is and of right ought to be, subordinate unto and dependent upon the imperial crown of Great Britain, as being inseparably united and annexed thereunto’.20 These characterisations introduce concepts of conquest, consent and contract, aspirations to the same liberties enjoyed by ‘free-born’ Englishmen, and relationships of equality or subordination. As a kingdom, Ireland and its peoples notionally possessed rights. In practice they often failed to match those enjoyed by the subjects of England, Wales or even Scotland. The mismatch between theory and practice irritated. By the 1640s, it was noticed that English rule failed to deliver automatic\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n9\n\naccess to English common law, despite the fact that there existed in Dublin and throughout much of the kingdom a replica of the English legal system.21 Then there were disagreements as to whether Ireland was a conquered territory, whether some of its inhabitants had voluntarily consented to the rule of England, or whether it was a colony peopled from England, Scotland, Wales and Normandy. Whatever the way in which English power over Ireland had come into being, questions arose as to how it was to be wielded. All agreed that sovereignty reposed in the English monarch. How then that figure was to exercise authority was less clear. Did the monarch act alone by virtue of his or her prerogative, in partnership with the English privy council, or through the English parliament? The Westminster parliament, increasing its assertiveness throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, meddled in Irish matters. The peoples of Ireland felt that English MPs were frequently less friendly than the monarch and his – or her – ministers. Accordingly, some in Ireland were inclined to cry up royal power at the expense of that of the English parliament: an attitude which could only worsen English MPs’ suspicions of Ireland. The latter were perturbed by what they took as their kings’ wish for freedom from parliamentary surveillance and inclination towards authoritarian styles of rule akin to those favoured in continental Europe. Many in Ireland, especially the Catholics, were suspected of sympathy with these royal ambitions. Suspicions worsened under the Catholic James VII and II (1685–8). A Catholic from Ulster excitedly told the king that, if it lay in his co-religionists’ power, ‘they would make you as absolute in Ireland as your heart could wish’. Furthermore, Ireland ‘by the king’s prerogative is at his disposal independently of the parliament of England’.22 Such notions made Ireland central not peripheral to the Stuarts’ programme. Successive monarchs and their advisers tried to tap its resources. Royal interventions in Ireland were interspersed with parliament’s. In 1642, the Westminster parliament decreed that lands belonging to insurgents should be used to repay investors, mainly from England, Scotland and Wales, who were underwriting the reconquest of the kingdom. Next, in the 1660s, Irish trade in live cattle was stopped; in 1699, the export of wool and woollen goods was similarly inhibited. More momentous still was the statute which in giving the English throne to William III and Mary II automatically installed them as rulers of Ireland as well. Shortly afterwards, oaths were imposed by an English statute which ensured that, from 1692, Catholics were debarred from the Irish House of Commons. Then, in 1720, Westminster\n\n10\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\ndeclared Ireland’s constitutional subordination to England. It did so to silence acrimonious and inconclusive assertions in Ireland about the powers of its own institutions, particularly the right of the upper chamber of the Dublin parliament to be the final court of appeal in contested legal cases. Such peremptoriness hardly endeared Westminster, England or their German monarchs to the Irish. A few were provoked to look for an alternative ruler and even to declare Ireland’s independence; rather more explored ways in which the practical inconveniences might be lessened and effective control of their own affairs could be regained. This last quest, it will be argued, succeeded triumphantly. Commentators placed Ireland within the ‘empire’ of first the Scottish, then the Dutch, and finally the Hanoverian rulers of England. These placements reveal the hybrid nature of the state of which Ireland was a part. It was a motley, collected over the centuries by inheritance, conquest or chance. The Stuarts’ and Hanoverians’ kingdoms had numerous parallels: the territories ruled by the kings of Denmark, France and Spain, the Habsburg emperor, and the Polish–Lithuanian commonwealth.23 Each posed, with variants, problems similar to those faced by the Stuarts and Hanoverians in Ireland. So long as English possessions were largely limited to Europe, Ireland was most obviously compared in its rights and treatment with Wales and Scotland, and with the outlying provinces in other composite monarchies. James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne in 1603. The resulting regal union further complicated dealings with Ireland. The Scots had long concerned themselves with the neighbouring island, the coasts of which were only a short voyage away. Some Scots soldiered there; others colonized accessible lands. Shared culture linked the highlands and islands with Irish Gaeldom. Long-standing ties tightened early in the seventeenth century when the governments in London and Edinburgh, now under a single king, encouraged a joint venture to pacify and exploit Ireland. Scots and English were granted estates in Ulster seized from troublesome locals, notably the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell. Official sponsorship merely consolidated already strong connections. The presence of Scots, particularly in the north of Ireland, introduced fresh problems rather than solving existing ones. Distinctive habits and religious practices added to the diversities of Ireland. When the Scottish settlers were attacked during the war of the 1640s, Scotland came to the rescue. In the wake of this warfare, more Scots settled, and a distinctive ecclesiastical system of Presbyterianism was imported and\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n11\n\nentrenched. Yet, the kingdom of Scotland had no constitutional standing in governing Ireland. By the end of the century, the way in which their English rulers treated the two separate kingdoms diverged. Presbyterianism was recognized as the state cult in Scotland; in Ireland, despite its strength, it was penalized, along with other forms of Protestant dissent. One Presbyterian in Belfast observed ruefully that, north of the River Tweed ‘all trust’ was allowed to a Presbyterian regime, yet elsewhere none of that persuasion was favoured with any.24 In Scotland, a distinctive legal system was also preserved; in Ireland, indigenous codes – the brehon law – were to be eradicated. Scotland, although invaded and subdued by the English in 1650, suffered no expropriation of its occupying owners; in contrast, the defeated Irish lost lands and positions. In 1707, fears that the Scots might prefer their own dynasty, the Stuarts, rather than the Protestant Hanoverians, after Queen Anne died, led to a treaty of union which yoked the Scots to the English. Ireland, although considered as a candidate to be united with Britain, was not incorporated except briefly and awkwardly during the 1650s. Occasionally, a belief that union would improve the condition of Ireland, or specifically the trade of Protestants there, beguiled a few.25 In practice, the advantages of not being legally united were appreciated. The Scots gained representation at Westminster and lost their own parliament. This loss, it has been suggested, in time diverted vibrant social and intellectual activity into an eighteenth-century Scottish enlightenment. Meanwhile Dublin retained its own parliament, which, as is shown below, became regular and dynamic from 1692. At the same time, something akin to an enlightenment, but more practical than speculative, flourished among the Protestants who crowded into the Irish capital. Scots and Irish were well aware of the parallels and differences in their situations. Both disliked English incursions. But, other than in the 1640s, they hardly coordinated their resistance. As England’s overseas possessions increased, so Ireland was seen, according to taste and need, as a kingdom in a multiple monarchy or as an appurtenance of empire, comparable to the North American colonies or the expanding Asiatic settlements. The uncertainties were further revealed by other portrayals of Ireland. In 1682, an English entrepreneur long settled in Dublin crowed that Ireland, or the parts of it known to him, ‘is become West England’.26 In doing so he expressed an aim which had inspired the lengthy English entanglement with Ireland. Other observers over the next century commended changes in proportion to the degree that they brought Irish economy, society, religion and\n\n12\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\npeoples closer to the English standard. Ireland was conceived as a distant province, in character and potential little different from west Wales, northern and south-western England, all of which had gradually been assimilated to wholesome English ways. Cheeriness was expressed by one Protestant in the Ireland of 1747. He asserted that ‘we are now one people; nor is there any material difference between a free Briton born in England and one born in Ireland, more than between a man of Yorkshire and a man of Kent’.27 These self-assessments overlooked those who prided themselves on their Irishness. Until the mid-eighteenth century, loud declarations of Irishness were seen as a quirk of Catholics rather than of Protestants.28 Commentators looked for and found different Irelands: a kingdom, a province, a collection of provinces, congeries of settlements of varying vintages, a near and ancient colony. Depending on the perspective of the viewer, it was portrayed as an unexploited El Dorado, grim Golgotha where the bleached bones of settlers, soldiers and natives attested to the repeated efforts to establish stable English communities, or an Eden forfeited by the transgressions of the occupants. Apprehensions and aspirations were projected into the landscape, so that contradictory descriptions resulted. These Irelands were not all imagined. The island accommodated a rich mixture of peoples, settlements, agrarian societies and towns. Some reminded of the tales of the exotic or barbarous; others matched what travellers saw in Britain and western Europe. Climate and ecology conspired against uniformity. Much of the kingdom seemed underdeveloped and under-peopled, notwithstanding pockets of pleasing industry. In 1719, a sympathizer reported that ‘one half of the people of Ireland eat neither bread nor flesh for one half of the year, nor wear shoes or stockings’. He concluded that ‘the hogs in England and Essex calves lie and live better than they’.29 By 1738, it was contended that Irish agriculture lagged one hundred years behind the rest of Europe. Disappointment at the slow pace with which Ireland was being made a second England provoked numerous proposals as to how to quicken the process.30 However, confidence that Ireland could be transformed was not universal. The glum uncovered structural differences between the two, supposedly sister kingdoms. But, common to virtually all these characterisations was the location of Ireland, physically and typologically, in Europe, albeit on its westerly margin, and alongside Britain, portrayed as an elder sister, even the stern but doting mother. Such observations lacked statistical precision, but testified to the way in which the perceived deficiencies in the Irish hinterlands offended the\n\nLAND AND PEOPLES\n\n13\n\nlovers of industry and populousness. Conditions in Ireland recalled those of peasants beyond Britain. During the 1720s, an Ulsterman likened the humble houses around Oldenburg without chimneys and with animals sharing the accommodation to those in rural Ireland. The observer linked material backwardness to systems of absolute government.31 In Ireland, it was easy to blame primitivism on religion. Apologists thought English (after 1707, British) rule a benign system perverted only by the obstinacy of the Catholics. Certain benefits were clear. In the mid-seventeenth century, the population was about 1.3 or 1.5 million. Within a century, it almost doubled. By the mid-eighteenth century, Ireland enjoyed a faster rate of population growth than any other European country.32 It accelerated as the century progressed. Existing towns expanded and new ones were founded. The growth ensured more labour and greater demand for staples. Few had access to land other than as tenants, cottiers or workers. Wages were small, and diet monotonous, if adequate, thanks particularly to the widespread consumption of dairy produce and the large-scale cultivation of the nutritious potato. Already in the 1650s, an observer stated that the versatile tuber was ‘most part of the poor’s food … Every one hath his potato garden.’33 Delight at this welcome increase in the labouring population turned into consternation when famine recurred, most horrifyingly in 1740–1. The shallow roots of the dramatic growth alarmed the thoughtful.34 Old projects were revived. Crops and methods which had increased agricultural productivity elsewhere were trumpeted. The manufactures which gave work to town- and country-dwellers in England and Wales were espoused. However, the clover, sainfoin and turnips which flourished in English soils did not always thrive in Ireland. Efforts to weave cloth, forge iron, blow glass or pot utensils seldom answered extravagant expectations. Nor did schemes to grow madder, hops and broccoli invariably succeed.35 Adventurous entrepreneurs sometimes lost heavily. Making textiles, from the wool and (later) flax which abounded, employed large numbers profitably. Unfortunately, the industry was prone to recession and embargoes. Undismayed, optimists, subscribing to the dogma of improvement, persevered. They sought to refine techniques and introduce novel products. At least with linen, it seemed by the mid-eighteenth century that they had triumphed. By 1751, linen and hemp amounted to half the value of goods exported from Ireland. At the start of the century, the commodities had provided no more than 8.4 per cent by value of Irish exports. In the same period, cattle products had fallen from more than half to 36.5 per cent of the worth of exported goods.36\n\n14\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nAnother fillip to the torpid economy was to people Ireland with immigrants from Britain. This strategy would simultaneously bring the island more firmly into the English ambit, implant scarce skills and diffuse prosperity. From 1172, settlers arrived. Sometimes the newcomers were accused of going native. Inevitably the distinct populations pollinated one another. Arresting sports resulted. By the close of the seventeenth century, pride in ethnic or geographical origins was often reinforced and sometimes complicated by confessional alignments. In general those who cherished an Old Irish ancestry remained Catholic. Among those who insisted on their Englishness, there was greater variety. The seed of planters before 1534 boasted of being ‘the English of Ireland’. They were aptly referred to as the ‘Old English’. They borrowed from the bible the phrase, ‘bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh’, to plead for friendly treatment by England.37 The Old English, in the main, adhered to Catholicism. Settlers arriving since the mid-sixteenth century – the New English – were usually (but not invariably) Protestant.38 A visitor to the south of Ireland in 1701 remarked that many inhabitants tried, despite the mixing, to maintain the separate terms of ‘Irish’ and ‘English’. The former ‘are the Roman Catholics and ancient natives; the latter, the Protestants, whose predecessors came out of England and Scotland; they are not pleased to be called Irish at home’.39 Instead, they described themselves proudly as the English of Ireland, or, if of Scottish ancestry and settled in the north of Ireland, as ‘British Protestants’. However, from the middle of the seventeenth century, religious confession was becoming the easiest way to sort the population. Confessional affiliation, adopted almost as a shorthand by governments, was widely used by the governed to explain and define differences, some of which were more invented than actual.40\n\nChapter 2: Rebellions and Reconquests, 1641–1691\n\nThe Uprising of 1641 Late in October 1641, Catholics in Ulster killed Protestant neighbours, ejected more from their homes and seized the settlers’ properties. The insurgents had intended to synchronize their actions with the capture of the English governors in Dublin. Once they controlled the government, it was expected that mastery of all Ireland would soon follow. But the Dublin plot was forestalled. Despite this reverse, others throughout the kingdom soon joined the bands in Ulster. The insurrection was not suppressed until early in 1653. Immediately questions propose themselves. Why did Ireland rebel? Why did the revolt last so long? The readiest answer is that the insensitive measures imposed by England estranged the indigenous political élite (or substantial sections of it). Provocations worsened in the 1630s, particularly under Charles I’s abrasive deputy in Dublin, Sir Thomas Wentworth. Yet, the rebels were not as one either in their timing or intentions. The trouble spread quickly beyond small groups of disgruntled landowners, lawyers and priests, to a wider constituency, sometimes disparaged as ‘the rascal multitude’.41 In time it would be convenient to blame the uprising on those outside conventional politics. Many more Catholics than MPs, landowners, lawyers and office-holders joined the struggle. Desperation, arising from physical privations, helps to explain the widespread activism. Undoubtedly there were tangible resentments: loss of lands, livelihoods and status to the newcomers. Debts bred discontents. Then, too, late in the 1630s, bad weather depressed already modest means, bringing more\n\n15\n\n16\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nto – and over – the brink of destitution. The humble, although unlikely to have access to the printing presses or to have their manifestos and utterances preserved, indeed in many cases not functionally literate, were not all innocent of sophisticated political and religious notions. Scotland rebelled against Charles I in 1637. Inevitably events there touched the Scots in the north of Ireland, who had remained in close contact with their kinsfolk in the northern kingdom. Stirrings of discontent in England as Charles I gravitated towards Rome, suspended representative institutions and collected novel taxes, also affected Ireland, where it was suspected similar policies were in preparation or already being applied. Around Europe, disgruntled subjects schemed to bring rulers to account. Both the theories through which they justified their resistance and the tactics which they then adopted were readily copied. Imitation is clearest and easiest to explain among the traditional leaders of Catholic Ireland. In particular, Catholic priests had studied in continental Europe before they returned to the Irish mission. Traders had set up around the north Atlantic littoral and sustained their co-religionists still in Ireland. Numerous soldiers, enlisted in the armies of Spain, France and the empire, picked up a miscellany of ideas and tactics, which they then spread through Ireland. Political sophisticates took their messages into their communities. The Irish rebels, like their counterparts elsewhere, declared that they fought for law, custom, faith or king. It was not always clear what they meant by these protestations and whether all protestors meant the same.42 If events in continental Europe affected the structure and dynamics of insurrection in Ireland, so too did the developing crisis in the Stuarts’ triple kingdoms. The upheavals also resulted from factors in train since at least 1541, and arguably from 1169. The results of the Confederate Wars of the 1640s and subsequent Cromwellian reconquest and settlement shaped Ireland for the next 150 years. The revolts, first triggered by localized grievances, protested against the rough methods of the English. During James VI and I’s reign (1603–25), even those who had not been stripped of lands were excluded from national office, and from influence over policy. Subtle politicians and lawyers, especially from the region of the Pale around Dublin, did not despair of regaining power. They skilfully exploited the embarrassments of their English rulers, proffering help through taxes and soldiers. Opportunities had opened in the 1620s when James VI and I and Charles I were at war first with Spain and then with France, but closed before the Irish Catholics could negotiate a durable deal, enshrined in a series of demands known as ‘The Graces’.\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n17\n\nThe multiplying difficulties of Charles I after the Scots rose in 1637 once more suggested that he might seek help from Ireland, where his Catholic subjects seemed best positioned to assist. During the 1630s, Lord Deputy Wentworth (later earl of Strafford) experimented with policies designed to strengthen royal and English authority over Ireland. Wentworth’s programme for Ireland had implications – at least potentially – for Scotland and England as well. Strafford was removed from office and eventually beheaded in 1641. He served as a scapegoat for the unpopular policies of the previous decade. His execution guarded against such measures being reintroduced, but created a vacuum in the government of Ireland. The absent king, preoccupied with problems closer to home, left Ireland to drift. On one side, those Irish hopeful of reversing the anti-Catholic programme of recent times saw and seized their chance. They advertised their optimism that soon their plight would be mended. The Catholic cheerfulness alarmed already apprehensive Protestants. The Catholics, while confident about the king’s good intentions, doubted his ability to put them into practice. Instead, throughout 1640 and 1641, Charles’s opponents, the militant Covenanters in Scotland and their allies in the Westminster parliament, gained ground. The ascendancy of the opposition heralded an intensification not a softening of the offensives against Catholics. A few Irish Catholics, rather than submit to these ominous developments, decided to take advantage of an increasingly confused situation in Britain. Accordingly, they plotted to recover their lost properties and to resume the government of Ireland. The protestors had their equivalents throughout Europe. Across the continent, many, once powerful, saw their customary rights eroded by administrations bent on centralization and greater uniformity. Most of the discontented professed conservative intentions: merely to restore things as once they had been – or were imagined to have been – and to free their monarchs from evil counsellors. Nostalgia for a distant, and no doubt mythical, golden age in which the now depressed had their due tripped off their tongues. Snobbery gripped others: they derided the newly arrived as uncouth. Conservative aims had often to be forwarded by means which looked (and were) radical, even revolutionary. In particular, as the rising in Ireland spread, it acquired a momentum which swept aside moderates and the undecided. Later, in attempts to extenuate the violence, notables lamented how the insignificant had been emboldened to enter the public scene. Pressures from outside the conventional political élites undoubtedly widened the conflict. Old grudges were also settled.\n\n18\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nOpportunists robbed neighbours, carried off clothing and furnishings, felled timber, maimed livestock, snatched horses, and pillaged barns and mills. On occasion, the robbers desecrated objects, notably bibles, sacred to the Protestants, and even dug up their corpses from graveyards. Whether this was a symbolic act aimed at removing the pollution arising from heretics or a device to make saltpeter needed for gunpowder can be debated. Protestants were killed. Reports soon put the total at 154,000. Panic resulted, and did not make for a cool appraisal of what was afoot. Modern research has reduced the deaths to a more plausible, but still alarming, 3000–4000. Soon the tides of war surged unpredictably, inundating some zones, especially those on frontiers between different regions, but leaving others unscathed. The writ of the king’s government in Dublin, despite the panoply of lord lieutenant, council, parliament and law courts, scarcely ran further than a narrow belt of the Pale. Its proclamations and edicts were increasingly irrelevant to what was happening in the interior of the island. The insurgents set up a rival government at Kilkenny in October 1642. Soon it governed a larger area than Charles’s truncated administration in Dublin. In time it gave a name to the whole movement – the Confederation of Kilkenny. The confederation proclaimed its loyalty ‘to God, king and country’. What it meant by the last – ‘patria’ – remains uncertain: whether an area coterminous with the island of Ireland or a more restricted and even mythic community.43 The leaders at Kilkenny had difficulty in imposing orders in remoter districts. As rebellion engulfed the kingdom, neither Catholics nor Protestants were united in their reactions. For many, sauve qui peut was the dominant maxim. In this spirit, they turned to whichever side offered the best prospect of material aid. The attitude of magnates could decide allegiances in their territories. Large landowners like the earls of Antrim, Clanricarde, Cork, Inchiquin and Ormond themselves paid troops. The paymasters then dictated where and how they should be used. Longer than in England, where aristocratic leadership of local forces gradually gave way to central payment and control, grandees in Ireland accounted for some of the local variations in alignment and action, giving the wars a baronial aspect. However, the peers’ rentals, in the case of the richest – Cork and Ormond – approaching £20,000 annually, could not finance protracted fighting. Ormond, burdened alike as the king’s deputy in Ireland and by his own debts accumulated over several generations, saw his disposable income drop to £600 by 1645.44 Each peer had local rivals keen to clip his power. The burden of paying contingents\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n19\n\noverstretched the resources of individuals, bequeathing debts which would never be redeemed and which in some instances – Antrim, Inchiquin and Ormond – contributed to the eventual eclipse of the families as major political actors. At the start of the 1640s, the aristocratic tenor of the revolt was pronounced, as indeed it was in Scotland and England, and Catalonia, Portugal and France. The course of the war not only weakened aristocrats financially, but their poor performance as leaders cast doubt on the notion that they should be, by virtue of their lineage and standing, the natural leaders in times of peace and war. The language, courtesies and gestures of deference continued to be employed long after the 1640s, but the realities of economy, confessional difference and politics attenuated the role of the lay peers. Even in the early episodes of the war, members of modest landed families moved to the fore.45 On each side, the clergy played disproportionate roles: greater than in the English civil wars. In large measure, it reflected the confessional character of the Irish conflict where the Catholic majority ranged themselves against the Protestants.\n\nWar, 1641–1649 Throughout the 1640s, the allies at Kilkenny upheld in theory as well as practice the continuing rule of the Stuarts over Ireland. Only a few dissented. Yet Charles was unable or unlikely to grant all that the Irish Catholics asked. In consequence, the bold pondered alternatives to the Stuart monarchy. Since the 1570s, Irish Catholics, when uprooted from their homeland, put themselves under the protection of the king of Spain. Many exiles settled in one or other of his territories: the Iberian peninsula; the Spanish Netherlands; Milan or the Two Sicilies. Catholics from Ireland travelled to other places, where the sympathetic responses of their princes meant that the pope, the duke of Lorraine, the Austrian Habsburgs and the Bourbons in France were courted as potential protectors of Catholic Ireland. Exploring these options in the 1640s – and later – excited controversy and split Catholic Ireland. Some Catholic theorists, usually priests, had been schooled in doctrines which elevated royal power above the constraints of law and representative institutions. The fieriest contemplated a total repudiation of England’s and the English king’s authority, and an independent Ireland as ‘a free state’. There were precedents for this stance, such as the United Provinces when they threw off Spanish overlordship in the late sixteenth century.46\n\n20\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nComplete independence for Ireland appealed more as a rhetorical extravagance than as a practicable policy. The fissiparous nature of power in Ireland, still strong despite the unity revered by England, was intrinsic in the system of Gaelic lordships which the English were overthrowing. The idea that a native ruler for the entire kingdom might be found in the person of the successor of the earl of Tyrone, an earlier victim of English pressures, was aired. However, if English rule was to be repudiated, the help of others would be needed. One foreign prince would be substituted for another. Whether Ireland as a distant province of Spain, France or the Habsburg empire would have suffered less intrusive government and colonization and would have reacted positively, even happily, is far from clear. Foreign princes were uninterested in the plight of the Catholics of Ireland except as sources of money and men which might then afforce their campaigns in continental Europe. In short, French and Spanish concern with Ireland differed little from that of the Stuarts. The pursuit of foreign alliances further complicated the politics of Ireland in the 1640s, supplementing but sometimes cutting across the schemes to strike deals with Charles himself or – in the cases of Ormond in Dublin and erstwhile royalists – with the Westminster parliament. During the 1640s, the Catholic diplomats enjoyed one asset which they soon lost. Governing much of the kingdom and commanding substantial armies, the representatives from Kilkenny negotiated from strength. This position did not bring any helpful alliance. After 1649, negotiators, although toppled from power, could boast of the great potential of Catholic Ireland to supply soldiers and (maybe) money. However, it was hard for foreign powers to take these overtures on trust and in return invade Ireland. In general, Catholic princes bothered with Ireland only when enmity with the rulers of England made campaigns in Irish waters or on Irish soil useful to distract from the main battlegrounds. Later, in 1689, the deposed James persuaded Louis XIV to back his bid to regain Britain from Ireland, and thereby return the Stuarts’s territories to the Catholic and pro-French camps. Again, as in the 1640s, the experience, a failure which spelt ultimate disaster for Catholic Ireland, emphasized the interdependence of Ireland, Britain and continental Europe, and the low place customarily taken by Ireland in the ordering of British and European priorities. In the unfolding crisis in Britain, Charles I was pitted first against rebels in Scotland and then in England and Wales. In Ireland, responses were increasingly governed by the factor which since the mid-sixteenth century divided the inhabitants: religious confession. Catholics, subject\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n21\n\nto irksome legal discrimination, explored how best to reverse it. If most hoped that their English king would of his own volition relax or cancel the offensive laws, there were doubts as to how best to extract the desired concessions. The cautious advocated diplomacy; the impatient wanted – like the Covenanters who had risen in Scotland or the English parliament which battled against Charles from 1642 – to force him to revoke the obnoxious laws. The leverage of the insurgents was strengthened by their hold on most of the kingdom other than Dublin itself and the eastern fringe of Ulster. At the headquarters in the inland city of Kilkenny, an assembly convened. More important was the executive agency in the shape of a supreme council of 24, recruited from the four provinces of Ireland. Under it, provincial councils for Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster, were designed to meet quarterly and had judicial as well as administrative functions. Across the country, at the several levels of province, county, town and barony, mechanisms were devised to deliver money, men and materials for the government at Kilkenny. The Catholics’ regime raised between £60,000 and £70,000 annually and in 1646 had perhaps 20,000 men under arms. These efforts strained weary civilians. New mulcts imposed originally as temporary devices were continued, sometimes under other guises, even after peace returned. The levies further impoverished an already debilitated Ireland.47 In the large areas loyal to Kilkenny, Catholic worship was publicly sanctioned. For the first time, the impact on Ireland of the CounterReformation was openly displayed. However, the king would not concede one important demand relating to Catholic rites. Pre-Reformation church buildings were not to be restored to the Catholics. The leaders at Kilkenny disagreed about the importance to be attached to this request. Lawyers, such as Nicholas Plunkett, Richard Bellings and Patrick Darcy, and landowners like Lords Mountgarret and Muskerry, pressed secular grievances relating to land and office. Accordingly, they demanded that office be reopened to Catholics on subscription to a simple oath of allegiance to Charles. They also wished that the Irish parliament function as the legislature of a kingdom, by according it greater freedom to initiate bills without prior reference to England, as required by Poynings’s Law of 1494. In contrast, clericalists agitated to extend the bare liberty of worship conceded to the Catholics and to put on a surer legal footing what they had achieved in many districts under their control. They reverted to objectives for which the Old English had pressed during the 1620s; similar requests recurred over the next century and a half. In the event, it proved impossible to agree any formula which distinguished\n\n22\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nbetween secular and religious allegiances, and allowed the readmission of Catholics to a place in civil government. The arrival of emissaries from the pope – first Scarampi (in 1643) and then (in 1645) Rinuccini – made the clergy more insistent that they repossess the churches built before the Protestant Reformation. Priestly intransigence widened the existing rifts within the supreme council and complicated the task of reaching any durable agreement with the king. The administration centred on Kilkenny built on structures already in place and added others which copied wartime innovations of the Scottish Covenanters, the English parliamentarians and the English royalists. These expedients have been highly praised. The confederates, it is suggested, governed ‘a unitary state’. In addition, this ‘highly sophisticated system of government’ was the chrysalis from which – in time – ‘modern Irish nationalism’ sprang.48 The military machine, once dismissed as disorganized, disorderly and unsuited to Irish conditions, has more recently been reassessed and adjudged successful. The lessons of siege warfare learnt in campaigns in the Low Countries and Central Europe, where numerous Irish Catholics had been fighting since the 1620s, suited the Irish terrain. The armies, at their peak numbering perhaps 20,000, won important engagements. Notable was that at Benburb in 1646. Scottish Covenanters who had come to the aid of the beleaguered Protestants of Ulster were routed by O’Neill’s northern force. In relation to the population and wealth of the island, the scale of the mobilization compared favourably with that of the Scots and the English parliamentarians.49 Yet, the Irish, like the insurgents in Scotland and England, aspired to more than they achieved. The confederates never fielded their full military force: at best, 11,000 of their men combined in any single assault.50 Central committees at Kilkenny – as in Dublin – struggled to be obeyed in the more distant parts of their jurisdictions. Before 1641 government was underdeveloped throughout much of the island. The confederates inherited and did not overcome localism and noncompliance. How loudly the issues of power and religious freedom resonated among the humbler inhabitants is impossible to detect. In Ireland, no less than in England, Scotland and Wales, locals resented paying ever heavier taxes and seeing those taxes spent on forces which soldiered outside their localities. Civilians, intimidated and coerced by troops supposedly friendly to their interests, fell victim to freebooters and marauders as well as to the enemy. The authority of the leaders at Kilkenny fluctuated in south Munster, west of the Shannon in Connacht, and in Ulster. In many details, these\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n23\n\nproblems merely reproduced endemic obstacles to uniform administration encountered by all national governments in Ireland. The mechanisms through which to rule remained fragile and incomplete; logistical problems prevented any quick communication of orders from the centre. The personnel manning local institutions had priorities rather different from those of their distant masters, and the latter frequently lacked the means to ensure absolute obedience. In time, as in England, Wales and Scotland, working relationships between centre and localities were hammered out. At least nominally, functionaries in the boroughs and counties complied with the formal requirements, such as swearing confessional oaths and periodically accounting for their stewardship to Dublin. In return, officials in Dublin and London did not enquire too minutely into what their local representatives did so long as they did not trigger more unrest or too flagrantly disobey instructions. The disunity among the leaders at Kilkenny during the 1640s worsened the centrifugal tendencies in the countryside. The failure of the Confederation to bind all whom it governed into a coordinated campaign helped to explain why it lost the war. Indicative of and an addition to these problems was a divided military command. Thomas Preston and Eoghan Rua [Owen Roe] O’Neill returned to Ireland in 1641 with experience of continental warfare. Preston was associated with the Pale and north Munster; O’Neill, with Ulster. Each represented a different strand of Catholic opinion: Preston, that of the Old English; O’Neill, the arguably more uncompromising attitudes of the uprooted native Irish. Each operated in his own region. The generals cooperated reluctantly and uneasily. Nor were matters helped by the Confederation itself retaining final control over strategy: a situation which paralleled the attempts by the Long Parliament in London to dictate to its commanders and armies. Only belatedly was the administration at Kilkenny streamlined. Local powers were overridden in the hope that all Catholics could be united in a national campaign. The king’s parallel administration, based in Dublin, had even less success in unifying the scattered redoubts of Protestants into a system able to resist and defeat the ascendant Confederates. As the area under Protestant control steadily contracted, so the difficulties of maintaining even a skeletal authority throughout the entire kingdom worsened. A parliament continued to meet in Dublin, but it was reduced to a Protestant rump when the Catholic members streamed away to the rival assembly in Kilkenny. The earl (from 1642 marquess, and later – 1660 – duke) of Ormond governed in the name of Charles I. Something of\n\n24\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\na protégé of Wentworth, Ormond had his role formally recognized when he was commissioned as the king’s lord lieutenant in 1643. He was assisted by a council. It was not as one. A few councillors questioned the wisdom of looking to Charles, while he was so preoccupied with his other kingdoms. A minority in Ormond’s council felt it would be wiser to rely on the Westminster parliament to defeat the Confederation. These divisions were as nothing to those which split Protestants elsewhere in Ireland. In Ulster, scene of the first and perhaps most violent stages of the uprising in 1641 and also the area of most intensive settlement by Scots, many pinned their hopes on their kindred among the rebellious Covenanters in Scotland. The Covenanters did indeed send forces to protect the north of Ireland. By 1644, the Scottish contingents under Robert Monro numbered 6500. Thanks to this help, the planters kept a toe-hold in the province. It was threatened by the successes of O’Neill, notably at Benburb. Bit by bit, as the insurgent Catholics were first contained and then repulsed, Scottish influence increased, and with it political and confessional divisions. In the other main district of recent settlement, south Munster, strategy differed. Settlers split between those who remained steadfast for Charles and those who preferred his enemy, the English parliament. By 1644, the latter looked better placed and keener to assist the embattled Protestants of Munster. Not only did Charles’s own sorry condition disable him from sending material assistance, it made him amenable to concessions to the Confederates. Charles, in dire straits, contemplated a deal with his Catholic subjects of Ireland. In return for a guaranteed share in future of the power and property of the kingdom, the Catholics at Kilkenny would divert their resources into the royalist war effort in England. In 1643, a truce was signed on the king’s behalf in the hope of freeing part of the royal army in Ireland for service in Britain. Five thousand of the men commanded by Ormond were shipped over to Wales and England, but they soon melted before the heat of parliamentarian fire. Instead of helping the king’s cause, they blemished it, since the English did not distinguish between these loyalist troops and the supposedly ferocious Irish who were said to have butchered the Protestants of Ireland in and after 1641. Charles, now desperate, in 1645 embraced the more ambitious but hazardous scheme of making peace with the alliance at Kilkenny. Through sizeable concessions, he hoped to buy an army of 10,000 from them. The discussions, pursued throughout 1645 and 1646, deepened the existing tensions at Kilkenny, in Dublin, at the king’s headquarters in\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n25\n\nOxford, and among the Protestants in the Irish provinces. Surreptitiously (and duplicitously), Charles sent personal envoys – Glamorgan and Digby – rather than relying on the wooden Ormond to strike a deal. The treaty was signed too late to deliver Charles from defeat in England, and was immediately disowned by the clerical party headed by Rinuccini. Protestants in Ireland, knowing that the king and his advisers were scheming to strip them of their privileges, recoiled. In Munster, for example, the provincial leader, Inchiquin, and his deputy, Lord Broghill, a son of the earl of Cork and later earl of Orrery, defected from the king’s to the English parliament’s side. The Westminster parliament, close to victory in England and Wales, appointed its own lord lieutenant for Ireland, Viscount Lisle: a rival to the king’s man, Ormond. In 1646, Lisle landed with parliamentary forces in the south of Ireland. The expeditionary army did little to contain a resurgent Confederation. By 1647, the latter menaced Dublin itself. The total loss of English control over the island loomed. In this crisis, the king’s viceroy, Ormond, more concerned to uphold English than Stuart authority over the kingdom, surrendered Dublin to the English parliament in July 1647. He calculated that the parliament was likelier to keep it from falling to the Catholics loyal to Kilkenny. On 8 August 1647, the confederate army under Preston was defeated. The threat to the capital receded, but most of the island continued in the confederates’ hands. Late in 1648, Ormond stitched together an incongruous alliance of confederates and Irish Protestants loyal to Charles. One weathercock, Inchiquin, swung back to the king. Many former combatants abstained from or opposed Ormond’s coalition. In particular, Owen Roe O’Neill, powerful in Ulster thanks to the hereditary influence of his dynasty in the province and his victories over the Scots there, held aloof. The nephew of Tyrone, who had fled from Ireland in 1607, he was rumoured to harbour regal ambitions. Were Catholic Ireland to set up in earnest as ‘a free state’, then O’Neill would be its most plausible head. In the Protestant camp, instincts of self-preservation directed notables in Munster, such as Broghill, and in Connacht, Sir Charles Coote, towards the powerful English parliament.\n\nCromwellian Reconquest, 1649–1660 The English parliament needed to be secure in England and Wales before it could spare energy and resources for Ireland. In August 1649,\n\n26\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nit acted. An army of 12,000 commanded by Oliver Cromwell was shipped to Ireland. Cromwell’s task was eased greatly by a defeat inflicted on the Confederates outside Dublin at Rathmines shortly before he landed. Thereafter, superior numbers, supplies and finances, together with calculated savagery, concession and luck, enabled the invading force gradually to re-establish English control over the country. In the period between 1647 and 1649, the forces of the Confederation had tended to retreat into their fastnesses. Rinuccini’s influence waned, even among some of the bishops. The representatives of Catholic Ireland redoubled the search for allies. Envoys journeyed to Rome, Paris and Madrid. Despite their exertions, no reinforcements arrived in Ireland. This in the end made the difference between victory and defeat. The Protestants of Ireland were saved, first by the tenacious Scots, and then by the enormous English army. This repeated the way in which earlier revolts had been suppressed and prefigured the war won by William of Orange. Other than for modest subsidies and the few ardent cavaliers who repaired from England, Wales and Scotland to Ireland, the alliance at Kilkenny lacked outside assistants. By 1652, with the surrender of the strongholds of Limerick and Galway on the west coast, reconquest was virtually complete. In the interval since Ulster rose in 1641, much had changed. In England, the king had been executed, monarchy abolished and a republic created: changes which strained relations with Scotland, involved in the joint enterprise of regaining Ireland. Neither France nor Spain had provided the expected help for the insurgents. The foreign powers, locked in a protracted and seemingly unending struggle of their own, although not uninterested in what was happening in Ireland and Britain, concerned themselves only intermittently with those distant places. During the 1640s, substantial Catholics in Ireland recovered much of what they and their ancestors had lost in the previous century, and resumed the government of localities and nation. These gains had not been free of discords: among the notables at Kilkenny over tactics; in the localities, over heavy taxes, oppressive government, overbearing priests and potentates, and soldiers on the march. All shared defeat. Soon enough, the backbiters would snap at each other with accusations of wrong-headed policies. However, the immediate aftermath of war brought more urgent problems. Cromwell, by 1649 the most renowned cavalry commander in parliament’s New Model Army, needed rapid successes. In the past, famed commanders like Queen Elizabeth’s favourite Essex, lost their reputations\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n27\n\nin the defiles and bogs of Ireland. Cromwell had to reassure his paymaster, the Westminster parliament, senior partner in the infant English republic, that its heavy spending on the Irish expedition was doing the trick. He had also to hurry to Scotland, where, in 1650, the friends of the king of the Scots, Charles II (Charles I’s heir), were preparing an offensive against the new regime. Cromwell, in taking two strongholds on the east coast – Drogheda and Wexford – used a savagery seen in England only during the closing phase of the Second Civil War. Otherwise, the killings reminded more of The Thirty Years War in continental Europe than of soldiering in Britain. In letters to the Speaker of the English parliament, Cromwell gloated over what had happened. Not just the garrisons, but civilians in the towns, had been killed. It looked as if military discipline, for which elsewhere Cromwell was famed, had broken down and his men had run amok. However, indiscipline was not the impression that Cromwell wished to convey. He wrote immediately after storming Drogheda: ‘I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgement of God upon these barbarous wretches who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood, and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future.’51 It was possible to argue that exemplary savagery of this kind would shorten the task of reconquering Ireland. In the longer term, it would save money, and repay more quickly those in England who had invested during the 1640s in the recapture of Ireland. At the same time, Cromwell expressed vengeful feelings towards the Catholics and Irish, groups now seen as synonymous. They had massacred Protestants and begun the rebellion. Elated by a string of victories in England, he – and others – cast the New Model Army as divine agents. These emotions fortified existing feelings that the Protestants of England were a, perhaps the, chosen people, with a God-given mission to bring their brand of Christianity and civility to a benighted Ireland. The lurid propaganda generated by the uprising of 1641 deepened religious and ethnic animosities towards the Irish Catholics. The English, bent on taking over the island, demonized the Irish. The Catholicism of the Irish was fused with earlier images of primitivism, even of savagery. Cromwell did no more than air the prejudices common among his compatriots. However, by publicizing and apparently rejoicing in the killing, Cromwell provided much of the evidence, which determined and darkened his subsequent reputation. Cromwell’s adversaries had only limited access to print. Their unflattering picture of him was fashioned and communicated chiefly through\n\n28\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\noral traditions. In the demonology of Catholic Ireland, Cromwell competed against more local villains, such as Ormond, often seen as the betrayer of Irish interests, and William of Orange, who completed what Cromwell had begun. Polemicists adopted a tit-for-tat approach. The distinct ethnic and confessional communities argued over which had committed the worst crimes. During the next centuries, Protestant partisans expatiated on the number of their forebears who had suffered at Catholic hands in the 1640s. Catholics lingered over the gory details of Drogheda, Wexford and their subsequent losses. They, as much as their Protestant supplanters, viewed themselves as a chosen people whose present sufferings would eventually be forgotten in a triumphant restoration. The contradictory uses of distinct pasts and essentially similar readings of Old Testament history and prophecy deepened the differences within the island arising from faith and ethnicity. In the shorter term, they comforted the dejected and emboldened the victors. After 1641 and again after 1688, the Protestants magnified what they had suffered. Indeed, in the 1640s, a black legend took hold. Catholic rebels were accused of slaughtering 154,000 Protestants: many more than Ireland then contained. This myth, as intended, determined English policy, justifying a retributive element. It convinced Cromwell, and helped to account for, if not to excuse, his conduct at Drogheda and Wexford. In the longer term, the stories inflamed and perpetuated anti-Catholic and anti-Irish feelings both in England and Scotland, and also among later generations of Protestants in Ireland. Through writings and rituals, the notion that there was an irreconcilable opposition between the fundamentals of Catholicism and Protestantism infected the institutions and culture of English Ireland.52 More immediately, this sombre reading of recent events led to acts of self-defence and revenge. The supposed perpetrators of the uprising and subsequent ‘massacres’ were easily identified as the groups traditionally powerful in Irish society: the clergy, the landed magnates, soldiers returned from continental Europe, and the lawyers. All were singled out for punishment. Catholic priests and monks were exiled. If they evaded the bans, they were to be rounded up and held in inhospitable locations, such as islands off the west coast, or executed.53 Only Protestants were to be permitted to practise in the law courts. Landed Catholics lost their property, and with it any likelihood of resuming their accustomed places in local and national government. Catholic freeholders in Connacht were said to have voted in 1661.54 Thereafter, with neither freeholds nor freedom of municipal corporations, the Catholics were disenfranchized. These\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n29\n\nexclusions were an augury of the more comprehensive bans enacted after 1691. During and after 1649 disease and famine ran through the population. Mortality was high: maybe as much as 20 per cent of the population died in the aftermath of the war. The catastrophe added to the practical and psychological impact of the defeats.55 It cast long shadows over both the victors – 18 per cent of the invading soldiery may have died – and the vanquished.56 The former entered onto a depopulated country, denuded of livestock, buildings and crops. Those representing the puny English republic after 1649, mostly strangers arrived recently from England, came with presuppositions about what they would find and what they should do. Few of these ideas boded well for the surviving population. The island had long been seen as backward, even barbaric. Evident underdevelopment combined with, and was explained by, the pervasive Catholicism. Both economy and religious ideology cried out for change. The methods now to be employed recalled in essentials those which had been tried repeatedly by the English in Ireland. The latest reverse for the Irish Catholics allowed familiar palliatives to be resumed. In particular, the confiscation of rebels’ property and its transfer to malleable Protestants from Britain, the basis of the smaller settlements of Ulster and Munster, would be extended into much of the island. A process already in train, the banishment of the indigenous Catholics to remoter and poorer lands, either in the uplands or on the western side of the country, would be accelerated. In 1653, it was planned to corral the remaining Catholic owners west of the River Shannon, either in the province of Connacht or in the neighbouring county of Clare.57 Two and a quarter million acres were to be redistributed.58 The fresh settlement continued the principles and processes long favoured in England. Lands would go to the soldiers who had recently recovered Ireland and the civilians who, since 1642, invested money to finance the recovery. If the bare lineaments recalled earlier plantations, the scale of the confiscations of the 1650s surpassed them. For this reason, the importance of the Cromwellian land settlement in creating the substructure on which Protestant dominance was based is entirely justified. It is shown most clearly in the simple statistic that, whereas in 1641, 59 per cent of the profitable lands in Ireland had been owned by Catholics, by 1688, the Catholic share had dropped to 22 per cent. An incipient Irish Protestant ascendancy came into being during the 1650s.\n\n30\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nResettlement and Restoration, 1653–1685 A vacuum had been created by the removal of so many. It was hoped that Protestant immigrants would fill it. The numbers of newcomers envisaged – upwards of 36,000 – failed to arrive. Many soldiers stationed in Ireland traded their rights to small portions of land and returned eagerly to Britain. Similarly, the officers, impatient to receive their entitlements and then disappointed when the grants often proved to be meagre, infertile and unprofitable, disengaged themselves. Few of the 1043 civilians who were recompensed for their investments of the 1640s with grants in Ireland took up residence on the properties. Instead, they deputed management to others on the spot. In some cases, they sold the holdings. In 1670, of the notional 36,043 new proprietors from the Interregnum, only 8000 had their grants of Irish property confirmed. Not all of them then settled in Ireland.59 The non-arrival of many intended beneficiaries of the Cromwellian land settlement left the field to Protestants already in Ireland. At first, the planters established before 1649, often termed the ‘ancient’ or ‘Old’ Protestants, feared that they might be swamped by the pushy agents of the English republic. Quickly, the revolutionary regime, fragile even in England, recognized that any likelihood of its making itself permanent was remote so long as it relied on an expensive and obtrusive army of occupation and a few headstrong administrators from England. It needed support from the local communities, and so turned increasingly to the settlers in and around Dublin, the midlands, Ulster and Munster. In the balmier climate prevailing from 1655, Old Protestants climbed into much that had been vacated by the longer established Catholic grandees: seats in parliament, the running of counties and boroughs, the professions, notably law, and trade, especially in ports such as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick hitherto dominated by Catholic merchants. What is more, fortunate Protestants acquired lands taken from the defeated Catholics, either by outright purchase at bargain prices or through long leases at low rents. The Old Protestant successes were displayed when Ireland, briefly united with England and Scotland, had to send 30 members to the Westminster parliament. Two-thirds of those elected in 1654 and 1656 came from the Protestant community established before 1649. A yet clearer sign of the new dominance of the Old Protestants was the composition of the representative body – the General Convention – summoned to Dublin early in 1660. Its brief was to watch over Irish Protestant interests in\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n31\n\na dangerous interlude when it was unclear how soon and on what terms the Cromwellian protectorate would give way to a restored Stuart monarchy. One hundred and forty-four delegates from the Irish provinces assembled. All were Protestant. Of those who can be identified, 98 sprang from families which had come to Ireland before 1649. Only 40 had arrived more recently. Of that minority of 40, 27 had soldiered in the recent Irish campaigns.60 The new Protestant monopoly over power and public offices was clearly visible. The Protestant interest had been fortified and, in time, would evolve into a Protestant ascendancy. The Protestants’ control, so lately won, was endangered by the return of Charles II in May 1660. He, and his brother and eventual successor, James VII and II, reverted to the stance of their father, Charles I. None of the trio subscribed to the adage beloved by militant Protestants throughout their three kingdoms: that Catholics were, by their very faith, imperfect subjects. The hostile contended that the Catholics’ fealty to the pope overmastered and might cancel their allegiance to the Stuart king. Both Charles II and James VII and II saw concrete advantages in using Catholics to rule Ireland. The Protestants there were a small minority, inadequate in numbers and local influence for the multiplying tasks of government. Moreover, their record was one of tergiversation or outright disloyalty. In addition, the royal brothers, in exile during the 1650s, encountered some from Catholic Ireland, such as Richard Talbot, later earl of Tyrconnell, and Theobald Taaffe, earl of Carlingford, and appreciated their sacrifices for the Stuarts. In the event, regal inclinations to recompense the Irish Catholics were translated into occasional and erratic gestures. After 1660, a few were helped, recovering lost lands and positions; more were disappointed. Soon disappointment turned to disgruntlement. The disgruntled rediscovered their predecessors’ stance of watching and waiting at the Stuarts’ and continental monarchs’ courts. The patient believed that a moment would come when the Stuarts, again desperate for Irish support against other adversaries, would grant what the Irish Catholics craved. The cautious tactics continued traits evident in the politics of Catholic Ireland earlier in the century and during the Confederation of the 1640s. The Old English, adamant about their loyalty and their standing as ‘the English of Ireland’, were chagrined not always to be believed by English politicians or their monarch. The loyalists contended that the débâcle of the 1640s discredited those who had turned away from the English king to others. According to this thinking, defeat after 1649 proved the folly of cutting the ties binding Ireland to the English monarchy.\n\n32\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nAfter 1660, the apparent sympathy of the Stuarts and the access to them enjoyed by notables such as Talbot recommended a return to the ‘Old English’ strategy. So far as the English government was concerned, calculus more than sentiment approved a policy of basing English rule in Ireland on well-disposed Catholics. Some Protestant loyalists within Ireland supported the more inclusive approach. Typical of the stance were Sir Maurice Eustace, the Irish lord chancellor from 1660 to 1665, and the first duke of Ormond, lord lieutenant between 1661 and 1669 and again from 1677 to 1685. Both descended from Old English families, many of whose members remained Catholic. Others, including Eustace’s successor as lord chancellor, Michael Boyle, also in turn archbishop of Dublin and of Armagh, were suspected of affection for the Catholics because they had married into their families. Archbishop Boyle indeed had allied with the Old Irish O’Briens, now anglicized enough to be ennobled as earls of Inchiquin and Thomond. So far as the Stuart monarchs were concerned, sharing power with reliable Catholics would ease their problems of ruling the kingdom. Catholics, therefore, were commissioned as magistrates and army officers, and appointed as sheriffs of counties and judges in the four central courts in Dublin. Such concessions were loudly opposed by Irish Protestants. Self-interest made the latter clamour for the maintenance of the monopoly that they had only lately acquired. They played on anxieties over the continuing peril of ‘popery’ and ‘papists’, shared by Protestants in Scotland, England and beyond. The uprising of the 1640s and the ultramontanes’ seeming willingness to switch rulers, lent plausibility to these accusations. In Ireland, the effects of debarring Catholics from public offices on grounds of their alleged untrustworthiness differed sharply from the impact of the same exclusions in Britain. It reduced the pool from which place-holders were drawn to maybe 15 or 20 per cent of the total Irish population, rather than the 95 per cent who were Protestant in Britain. Irish Protestants’ strictures about the disloyalty of the Catholics sat oddly with their own wavering allegiances. Many had abandoned the defeated Stuarts and rallied to the Cromwellian conquerors: an opportunism which would be repeated when they speedily jettisoned James VII and II and embraced William of Orange. After 1660, Irish Protestants were perturbed by the pro-French and pro-Catholic orientations of Charles and James. The worried in Ireland allied with the kings’ English critics. A few Irish Protestant grandees, such as Lords Anglesey and Orrery, dividing their time between Ireland and London, were well-placed to connect the opposition in the two kingdoms. Such links were important\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n33\n\nto Irish politics throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. When Irish politicians adopted the rhetoric and tactics of the parliamentary – and indeed extra-parliamentary – opposition in England, it was no accident. As in the 1630s, so in the 1670s and 1680s, what was happening in Ireland warned of what the Stuarts might try in Scotland and England. Monarchs, less trammelled in Ireland by the need to summon parliament and with an overwhelmingly Catholic population, used their prerogative uninhibitedly to bring Catholics back into full membership of the state. Opponents in Ireland, powerless to stop these initiatives, relied on sympathizers in the Westminster parliament or in the courts and streets of London to question and thwart the schemes. As early as 1672, the corporation of Dublin, fearful that its character as a Protestant monopoly would be diluted, mimicked Londoners’ opposition to Stuart rule.61\n\nThe Reign of James VII and II, 1685–1691 Protestants were unnerved by the pace with which their precarious ascendancy was weakened. Catholics, naturally, were heartened. The calculations of the Old English, guided by Richard Talbot, were vindicated. James, ascending the throne in 1685, rapidly dismantled the Protestant dominance. Catholics were appointed to the privy council, the judicial bench, the magistracy and other county offices. Above all, two appointments symbolized the Catholic resurgence. Tyrconnell was appointed lieutenant-general of the army in Ireland. He cashiered Protestants and commissioned and promoted his fellow Catholics. Early in 1687 the king made him lord deputy, and so head of the civil administration. The return of local offices to Catholics prepared for a parliament in Dublin, which, like its English counterpart, was expected to approve James’s measures. The 117 boroughs, which elected the majority of members to the Commons, were put into reliable hands. As in England, Protestant dissenters as well as Catholics were favoured. The former no less than the latter, it was maintained, would benefit from the king’s more inclusive approach, and so would endorse his measures. Those Irish Protestants, out of favour during the heyday of Ormond and the returned cavaliers during the 1660s and early 1680s, looked for better times under James. Most soon realised that they would be outnumbered by the emboldened Catholics, but hesitated openly to oppose the king.\n\n34\n\nTHE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, 1641–1760\n\nA second harbinger of the ending of this precarious Protestant ascendancy was the intrusion of two Catholics into fellowships at the Protestant seminary of Dublin University, Trinity College. This echoed the furore when James appointed a Catholic to head Magdalen College in Oxford. Trinity College, Dublin, a much smaller institution than either Oxford or Cambridge universities, could not mobilize the same extensive network of alumni and allies. Nevertheless, the interference, resolutely resisted by the college, presaged an assault on the privileged position of the Church of Ireland, with which it was intimately linked. The anxieties were increased when a recent convert to Rome, Peter Manby, was installed as dean of the cathedral of Derry.62 As yet, this was an isolated episode. More ominous was an inclination not to fill vacant bishoprics: inaction which brought the episcopal revenues into the royal coffers and would in time deprive the established Protestant church of its leaders. Equally unsettling was the encouragement to Catholic parishioners to withhold the payment of tithes: the principal income of the Protestant clergy. There were also hints that a target of the Catholics in the 1640s – the physical repossession of pre-Reformation church buildings – was once more sought by the militants.63 Isolated incidents warned of a popular hostility to the personnel and property of the Church of Ireland. At Kilmallock in County Limerick, an officiating minister of the established Church, was killed in the graveyard.64 Episodes of this sort brought predictions of more widespread violence reminiscent of the bloodshed in and after 1641. Trinity College as a precaution tried to transport 4000 ounces of its silver plate to England on the pretext that it needed to be refashioned, but in reality to guard against the possible depredations of rivals. The shipment was blocked by Tyrconnell.65 Private landowners found it equally difficult to convey their valuables back to Britain. Remitting rents from Ireland to England became increasingly troublesome. Protestants in Ireland, chary about quixotic gestures of opposition, sullenly acquiesced in the royal measures. Those able to do so removed themselves from Ireland to the England, Wales or Scotland whence they (or their forebears) had come.66 A few, despairing of making careers in the new Catholic Ireland, relocated themselves in the Low Countries, happy to soldier with William of Orange. Charles II and more particularly his openly Catholic successor, James, reversed many of the disabilities under which substantial Catholics had laboured. However, in two matters they proceeded more cautiously than impatient Catholics wished. Protestants granted land in the 1640s and 1650s were not summarily stripped of the new possessions. Tortuous\n\nREBELLIONS AND RECONQUESTS, 1641–1691\n\n35\n\nlegal processes between 1663 and 1667, overseen by a Court of Claims in Dublin, obliged Protestant proprietors to disgorge as much as a third of the recent grants. Others would be required to exchange attractive portions for lands in remoter and infertile regions. Ardent Protestants contended that the nascent Protestant interest would be weakened and the pacification and enrichment of the kingdom – rather than of themselves – would be retarded. The Dublin authorities, charged with implementing the proposals during the 1660s, resorted to subterfuge, intimidation and cajolery to overcome the opposition. In particular, the lord lieutenant, Ormond, deputed the management of parliament to others: a herald of tactics that became common in the next century. Chief among the managers was the earl of Orrery, younger son of the most important settler family in Munster, the Boyles, whose head was earl of Cork. Orrery saw himself as more attuned to the worries of fellow Protestants than Ormond. Personal jealousy towards Ormond was rationalized by Orrery, who contended that Ormond, although unswervingly loyal to the Stuarts throughout the 1640s and 1650s, had too many ties of blood, friendship and interest with the Irish Catholics to be a reliable English governor for Ireland. Orrery, through his dexterity first in exciting and then quieting Irish Protestant fears, hoped not only to make himself indispensable to Ormond as a political fixer, but also to demonstrate to the king and his ministers in London that he would make a better viceroy than the indolent Ormond.67 Orrery never persuaded English rulers to let him govern Ireland. Yet, his ambitions destabilized government as he looked constantly for ways to belittle and besmirch Ormond. In this, Orrery prefigured the factiousness which regularly unsettled Protestant Ireland. More constructively, Orrery, in pursuit o"
