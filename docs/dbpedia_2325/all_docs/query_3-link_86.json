        "text": "Hugh Boulter (1672-1742) was born in London. Educated at Oxford, he was made Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1719, Boulter served as chaplain to Hanover, on behalf of King George I. 1 In 1724. George nominated Boulter to the Primacy of the Protestant church in Ireland, then vacant, which he hesitated to accept. 2 He arrived in Ireland in November of that year. The sending of English-born Bishops to Ireland was viewed by the Westminster government as 'an indispensable condition of the preservation of English supremacy in the government of Ireland'. 3 During his time in the country, Boulter quickly established himself as a central figure in the government of Ireland where he assiduously promoted the English interest which also meant the Protestant interest, in the country. In accordance with the latter aim. Boulter was involved in a number of projects to found schools for the conversion of Catholics. They were largely unsuccessful."
