        "text": "There were few sights, wrote the Wrexham historian Alfred Palmer, which “refreshed” his eyes as much as the early 18th century vicarage of Berse Drelincourt and its setting. Fortunately for us, the house is still visible. The surroundings have sadly changed since Palmer’s time, with the “noble” avenues of trees leading to Croesnewydd house now obscured by the Wrexham bypass, but the house’s simple, gracious architectural style is one of the few reminders of the district in a time before the Industrial Revolution reshaped it for ever.\n\nBerse Drelincourt is not in Brymbo township, but is one of the main landmarks on the old road between it and Wrexham. North of the house stands a small church of the same period, without a specific dedication though sometimes called ‘St Paul’. The church, unusual in a landscape of mainly 19th century chapels, recently closed and is now converted to a house. The church and house were both built by the same family, the Drelincourts; though they themselves lived in London or elsewhere much of the time, the presence of the church and an associated charity school, set up in and around the house, ensured that their influence lingered in the area long after their departure.\n\nThe head of the family was Peter Drelincourt (1644-1722), an Irish churchman of French Hugenot extraction. He was Dean of Armagh, and it seems likely that he rarely if ever set foot in his Welsh estates. His wife Mary, on the other hand, certainly lived in the area after her husband’s death. Their daughter Ann, although spending much of her time in London, also had fairly close connections with Wrexham parish. She married a Scottish peer, Hugh Primerose, 3rd Viscount Primerose, and both her and her husband are buried at St Giles in Wrexham.\n\nSome older texts state that Mary Drelincourt’s maiden name is unknown, but in more recent times it has been suggested that she was the daughter of Peter Morris or Maurice, who was briefly Dean of Derry before his death in early July 1690 (another of Morris’s children, Theodore, became Archdeacon of Tuam). Alfred Palmer, on the other hand, confidently asserts that she was the daughter of John Vesey, the Archbishop of Tuam, although as usual without giving his sources. Either way she clearly moved in the same Irish ecclesiastical circles as Drelincourt, but I think the Maurice explanation to be rather closer to the truth, as both Mary Drelincourt and an “Edward Maurice” were involved with administering the estate of Theodore Maurice.\n\nThe presence of Mary Drelincourt in north-east Wales is another puzzle. Other than his status as Dean, nothing more is recorded about the origins of her supposed father Peter Maurice. Mary has been suggested to be a “Welsh heiress” as explanation of how the Drelincourt family came to acquire land around Broughton and Bersham. ‘Maurice’ certainly sounds Welsh enough, though there are also Irish (and English) derivations of the name. The rather distinctive name ‘Theodore’, borne by the Archdeacon of Tuam, does hint at the large, ancient and extremely influential Maurice family of Lloran Ucha in Denbighshire, other members of whom also used the name. A further hint is given by the chalice once used for Berse Drelincourt church, cruelly characterised by Palmer as “very inartistic“, and which was the gift of one “Mrs Eleanor Morris of Penybont“. Penybont was one of the several houses attached to the Lloran Ucha estate, so perhaps Eleanor was a relative of the chapel’s benefactress Mary Drelincourt, as there are certainly few other explanations of why she might have donated plate to this obscure place of worship.\n\nThe Drelincourts’ estate in Wrexham parish, despite its name, lay mostly within Broughton township rather than Bersham; it was, however, formed of land which had in previous centuries been part of the Higher Berse estate. The latter had once been one of the area’s most important houses, occupied by a junior branch of the Puleston family. The Pulestons of Higher Berse, descendants of a formidable-sounding 15th century knight who had hacked his way into favour at Bosworth Field, had intermarried with several of the old freeholding families of Bersham, as well as our old acquaintances the Griffiths of Brymbo. Despite being one of the leading families of 16th and early 17th century Wrexham, they were long gone by Mary Drelincourt’s time: John Puleston of Berse died in 1693, and his house (like nearby Lower Berse) was reconstructed by the owners of Plas Power in the 19th century, and now has little trace of its former status. The farm of Middle Berse, then apparently known as “Morgan’s Farm” after its tenant John Morgan, was also part of the old Puleston estate, and was added to the Drelincourts’ possessions at some point. They also had some land in the parish of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd. It is unclear exactly when Peter Drelincourt came into possession of this and the land in Broughton, but he talks rather generally of his “estates in Wales” in his will, drawn up in 1716, and it seems probable that his wife’s origins had some hand in it.\n\nAs is often the case with these things, the answer to both problems – Mary Drelincourt’s ancestry and how her Franco-Irish husband ended up with land in Wrexham parish – has already appeared in print, just in a place so obscure few people would have looked. An early 19th century book called Memoirs of the Author of Indian Antiquities, written by Thomas Maurice, contains a fuller explanation. Maurice was – rightly or not – convinced he was a descendant of the Maurices of Lloran Ucha, and quoted a letter received from “Mr Corbet[t]”, their senior descendant. Corbett wrote:\n\n“The last possessor of the estates of the Maurices, in the parishes of Whittington and Sellattyn near Oswestry, in Shropshire, was Edward Maurice, of Pentre Kenry, in the parish of Sellattyn, who left one son, Pryce Maurice, born and registered in 1699. Edward Maurice married the daughter of Mr. [Edward] Pryce, of Fynogion, near Ruthin, and Bersham, near Wrexham, in Denbighshire, now the property of Veesey, Lord Dawtrey, or Cremorn, left from her family totally by the Viscountess Primrose, only daughter of Dean Drelincourt, and his wife, the sister of Edward Maurice, of Pentre Kenry”\n\nSo, here we have a conclusive explanation of Mary’s origins – she was indeed a Maurice, seemingly of the branch of the family who owned Pentre Kenrick in Whittington parish. This is perhaps her baptism, recorded in the Whittington registers of 1669: Dec. 3. Mary, d. of Edward Maurice, gent., of Pentrekynricke, and Eleanor, his wife; borne on the 20th day of Nov… bap. Theodore Maurice of Tuam was a near relation, explaining the Irish connection. Moreover this explains her relation to Berse, which Mr Pryce of Ffynnogion must have obtained from the Pulestons , or their executors, before its passing to the Maurices and then the Drelincourts.\n\nBack, in any case, to Peter Drelincourt’s will. In it he allows £700 to build a charity school on these estates, and by 1719, when a surviving document gives a list of subscriptions towards the school, it had been settled that it would be built “at Berse“. The list shows Drelincourt only contributing £100, a fact Palmer coyly notes as “difficult of explanation“. The next biggest contribution came from Mary Myddelton of Croes Newydd, with others coming from the perennially charitable Lady Dorothy Jeffreys, John Roberts of Hafodybwch, and other local notables. Despite all this it was to be over thirty years, and well after Peter Drelincourt’s death in 1722, before the school was actually built at Berse. In the interim, Mary Drelincourt had constructed a small but handsome mansion there – probably in the 1730s – and lived in it, her name appearing in the rate books from 1742 onwards. 1742 is also the date given to Mary Drelincourt’s small chapel, built at the end of what was once an avenue of beeches leading from the house. The locals inevitably referred to it as the Capel Madam, ‘Madam’s Chapel’, though a number of other people had a hand in funding it too. Like its founder and many of the original subscribers, several were women. One of them, Elizabeth Bennett, was one of the several close female acquaintances who lived with Mary Myddelton at Croesnewydd; she gave £20.\n\nYou are probably wondering what became of the charity school. Well, Palmer notes an indenture dated 13 November 1751 in which Mary and her daughter Ann reiterate their intention to found it, so at that point it was clearly still not set up. They do, however, state their intention to fund its maintenance out of the rent of Berse Drelincourt, several parcels of land in Broughton, and a rentcharge on other properties. Dean Drelincourt’s £700 (or £100) and the money subscribed in 1719 is mentioned nowhere, and what actually became of it, if it was ever paid, is a matter of speculation.\n\nThe school finally got off the ground soon after, but Mary Drelincourt died not very long after its founding. Palmer could not find a date but notes she disappeared from the rate books after 1754. Her will was, in fact, proved in June 1755, at which point she was still described as of London, and where she was presumably buried. A local tale that she was buried in the chapel she had founded is likely based on the fact that a commemorative tablet was set up there: this encouraged the congregation, while fidgeting on their pews, to practice the same virtues as her, whereupon “thou wilt most assuredly Meet with a Reward“.\n\nAnn, Lady Primerose, continued running the school and church, making, as Palmer described it, “the most minute provisions” for their management. She also set the curriculum for the twenty poor girls of Wrexham and Llanfair parishes, which seems to have mostly consisted of reading, knitting, spinning, and “all manner of housewifery“. In addition, she personally chose both the scholars and the mistresses, although directing the trustees to do so after her death. In the wider world, Ann left her mark on history as an active supporter of the Jacobite cause, and the charity school at Berse was the subject of some persistent stories centreing on its Jacobite connections. One of these was that it was used to educate Jacobite orphans, rather than the poor children it was intended for. There is also the usual vague cloak-and-dagger stuff about secret tunnels running from house to church (this kind of tale seems to spring up everywhere: there were supposed to be similar tunnels running from Brymbo Hall to the church, although the latter dates only from the 19th century). Although scarcely credible, such stories perhaps a little more understandable when you consider the strongly Jacobite strain in the upper echelons of Wrexham society during the late 17th and first part of the 18th century. After the death of Sir Griffith Jeffreys of Acton, in 1695, its most powerful currents were to emanate from Wynnstay, where Sir Watkyn Williams-Wynn was the subject of regular Establishment scrutiny. His Jacobite ‘club’, the Cycle of the White Rose (sometimes stated to have been founded in 1710, and sometimes in 1723, the date on its earliest surviving list of regulations and members) included several landowners from the district around Berse: John Robinson of Gwersyllt, George Shakerley of Lower Gwersyllt, Robert Ellice of Croesnewydd and Richard Clayton of Brymbo Hall, whose wife Mary had previously been married to Sir Griffith Jeffreys’ heir, Robert.\n\nThe Cycle, despite more romantic accounts emerging from the fevered imaginations of 19th century novelists, had little opportunity to do more than drink and perhaps encourage trouble at election time (though Sir Watkin and Thomas Eyton of Leeswood, at least, were seen as likely to join in any actual rebellion should the opportunity present itself). A more practical means of support for the Stuart cause lay in Lady Primerose’s efforts to channel funds to the Young Pretender, which she apparently did quite effectively. (He even, allegedly, appeared at one of her London parties in 1750; “to her ladyship’s great dismay“, as Palmer put it). And even if the political cause to which she devoted herself fizzled out, the school she had helped to set up survived for many years – a far more lasting legacy than the ineffective plotting of her male colleagues."
