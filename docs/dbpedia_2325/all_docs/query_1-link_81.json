Commen&aton) tRote from fbie (Brace tbc %ovt> iprimatc \" The Pdace^ Armagh, Feb. 21, 1911. \" / have the greatest possible pleasure in commending the persevering and painstaking work of the Rev. James B. Leslie in the compilation of the History of the Clergy and Parishes in the Diocese of Armagh. Far too little interest has hitherto been taken in such valuable antiquarian research; and my friend Mr. Leslie is well qualified by diligent and accurate scholarship to produce such a book, both readable and of general interest. I anticipate for it a wide circle of readers. JOHN B. ARMAGH, Primate and A rchbishop. ' ' — •*• — ARCHBISHOP GROZIER. The printing of this book having been almost completed before the Election of the Primate, it was not possible to include in the List of Primates, at foot of page 6, more than Dr. Crozier's name. The following particulars are therefore given here instead : — 1911— John Baptist Crozier, T.C.D. B.A. (Jun. Mod. Eth. & IvOg.) 1872 ; M.A. 1875 : B.D. and D.D. 1888 ; Downes Prize 1875 ; Div.

THE aim of this work has been to give Succession Lists of the Clergy of the Church of Ireland in the Diocese of Armagh from the earliest possible period, together with biographical and genealogical information under each name, and historical notes about each parish, so that it might be readable and of general interest. References to the sources of information have, as a rule, been given : this being a prominent feature of the book. Few persons can form an adequate conception of the immense labour and research involved in the work. The names in the Index, though of Clergy alone, number over 2,400. The Diocese of Armagh is rich in manuscript material for such research, as can be seen from the List of Authorities used. The connection of Bishop Reeves with the Diocese was to it a veritable endowment ; for, although he published little concerning it, he left behind him many manuscripts, in his beautifully concise writing, full of information for a Diocesan historian. If he were alive to-day, no one would be more delighted, I believe, at the issue of such a book than Bishop Reeves, at whose hands I received Deacon's Orders. The preparation of this work was first suggested to me by one to whom I have been much indebted during the past eleven years for help — ^parochial as well as literary — un- grudgingly rendered, — namely, Mr. John Ribton Garstin, D.L,., Past Pres. R.S.A.I. and V.P. R.I. A., who was associated with Dr. Brady in the compilation of his Records of Cork, Cloyne and Ross and with Archdeacon Cotton in the pre- paration of his Fasti. Mr. Garstin (who contributes an Appendix), kindly revised my manuscript and corrected the proofs ; and his accurate scholarship and extensive knowledge of antiquities and of family history kept me from making many mistakes. To him also I and my readers are indebted vi. Preface. for the View of Armagh Cathedral, taken from Ware's Works, and for the loan of the rare Map of the Diocese reproduced as a frontispiece. I have also to thank Rev. H. J. Lawlor, D.D., Professor of Ecclesiastical History, T.C.D., who revised part of my manuscript and read the proofs, suggesting many corrections and improvements. Dr. I<awlor is engaged in the preparation of a Calendar of the Ancient Armagh Registers, which, when published, will be a boon to all interested in Irish Church History. Rev. C. K. Irwin, B.D., Diocesan Registrar (who placed at my disposal his own MS. Succession List), Rev. H. B. Swanzy, M.A. (to whom I am indebted for much genealogical information, &c.), and Mr. Tenison Groves, B.A., Record Agent (who has given me much help regarding the Common- wealth period), also kindly read and corrected the proofs. My thanks are also due to Mr. James Mills, Deputy Keeper, and Mr. H. F. Berry, D.Ivitt., Assistant Deputy Keeper, and the Officials of the Public Record Office for faciUties for research in that office; to the Board of Armagh Public Library for facilities in consulting MSS., and to Rev. Precentor Morgan, LL.D., Keeper, and Rev. C. Paris, M.A., Assistant Librarian of that Library ; to the Librarian and Assistants in the Library of T.C.D., the National Library, and the British Museum ; to Mr. C. H. Miller, M.A., Assistant Registrar T.C.D. ; to Rev. C. T. M'Cready, D.D., for assistance rendered in the office of R.C.B. ; to the late Dr. Francis Crossle, of Newry, who kindly copied for me from his Collection of Northern Newspapers all references to Armagh Clergy in them since 1750 ; to Colonel G. H. Johnston, of Kilmore, for copies of his Pedigree Collection relating to Armagh Clergy ; to Major R. R. G. Crookshank, for correcting some of the proofs and for genealogical information. My brethren, the Clergy of the Diocese of Armagh, as a rule, were helpful to me, and granted me facilities for research in their Parish Registers and Vestry Books. Preface. vii. In this connection my thanks are due to the following : — Ven. the Archdeacon of Armagh, D.D. ; Very Rev. the Dean of Armagh, B.D. ; Revs. F. S. Aldhouse, M.A. ; E. F. Allworthy, M.A. ; J. W.

My thanks are further due to the following — viz., The Lord Bishop of Cork, D.D. ; Revs. Canon S. C. Annstrong, M.A. ; Canon Lett, M.A., M.R.I. A. ; Canon G. Mahaffy, M.A. ; R. J. Merrin, M.A. ; W. Ball- Wright, M.A. ; W. J. Latimer, M.A. ; and T. Gogarty, C.C. To Colonel M. Carpendale, Colonel T. J. Jones, Captain Lowry, V.L. ; F. Elrington BaU, Esq., M.R.I.A. ; W. H. Maitland, Esq.; J. H, Porter-Hatton, Esq.; Mrs. Ross, Mrs. Montgomery, Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Long, Miss M. Brabazon ;, Miss A. Maclean, Miss Lee, Miss Sandford, Miss Carpendale, and many others. Considerable care has been taken to have the information included herein as accurate as possible ; yet no doubt errors may have crept in. I shall be grateful for any additions viii. Preface. or corrections sent to me : especially if the encouragement accorded to the Work shall warrant a Second Edition or Supplement. Finally, I must heartily thank the subscribers to the work — among whom I have the honour to include not onlj'' the recently elected Primate of All Ireland and his revered Predecessor, but also the Primate of All England, and many other distinguished men. The book is noteworthy as a creditable specimen of Irish Provincial printing, and evinces not only the skill of the printer, but the sound judgment and s)niipathetic care bestowed by Mr. Tempest on the work. I hope that the book will throw light on the History of the Church of Ireland, and be found useful in rescuing from oblivion the names of many servants of God, who having been faithful in their day and generation, then \"fell on sleep.\" JAMES B.

The ordinary Clerical Directories have of course been con- sulted, such as Crockford's, Charles', (now Irish Church Directory), The Irish Clergy List (Tempest, Dundalk, 8 years from 1904), Lea's Ecclesiastical Calendar 1814, Robertson's « Irish Church Directory 1840; Oldham's, 1858; Erck's Ecclesi- astical Register, 2 editions, about 1820. There is also Brad- shaw's Directory of Co. Armagh, &c., 1819 BOOKS RELATING TO BISHOP'S AND CLERGY Ware's Bishops. This is the first of the two volumes of Walter Harris's edition of the Whole Works of Sir James Ware, origin- ally in Latin. Two editions were published, foUo, Dublin, 1739 and 1764, the latter being a mere re-issue not brought up to date. Besides plates in the text there are 18 full-page engravings, chiefly of Cathedrals about 1739. A copy with all these is very rare. The view prefixed to this work is taken from this. The book has copious information about Bishops only down to 1739. . . . . . . Ware. Cotton's Fasti — viz.. Fasti Ecclesiae Hibemicae.

ARCHBISHOPS OF ARMAGH, PRIMATES OF ALL IRELAND. [It lias not been thought necessary by the Author to give more than a bare list of the Primates (with a few notes), since the Succession, and an account of these prelates is so fully given in Ware and Cotton, and more recently and correctly in Stuart's History of Armagh edited by Rev. Ambrose Coleman, O.P. (Dundalk : Wm. Tempest, 1900). Mr. J. R. Garstin, F.S.A., has given in that work a full account of the post- Reformation Primates of the Church of Ireland.] 445 — St. Patrick. The generally accepted date of his landing in Ireland is 432, but see Dr. Olden's The Church of Ireland, Appendix H., and the Author's Mission of St. Patrick, where strong reasons are shewn that this date is not correct, but that his landing in Ireland took place earlier. 455 — Benignus, d. 9 Nov., 467. 467 — Jarlath, d. in 481. 481 — Cormac, d. 17 Feb., 497. 497 — Dubthach I, d. in 513. 513 — Ailild I, d.

Feb. 18, 1470. 1471 — John Foxall, d. in 1475, having never seen his diocese. 1475 — Edmund Connesburgh, res. in 1476. 1478 — Octavian de Spinellis, more usually known as Octavian de Palatio ; d. in June, 1513 ; bur. in St. Peter's, Drogheda. 1513 — John Kite, res. 12 July, 1521, for Archbishopric of Thebes aud Bishopric of Carlisle ; d. at Stepney, London, 19 June, 1537 ; bur. in Stepney church. 1522 — George Cromer. Was a supporter of the Pope against the Crown at the Reformation ; but evidently after a time ceased his opposition, for he was deposed by the Pope in 1539 on account of heresy. The Pope appointed Robert Wauchope to succeed him, and from Wauchope the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland counts its Succession of the Primates. Cromer died on March 16, 1543. 1543 — George Dowdall, Prior of Ardee ; consecrated by Staples, Bishop of Meath and other bishops Dec, 1543, having been nominated by the Crown. He had previously accepted a pension from the Crown on the dissolution of his priory at Ardee, and was R. Clonmore 1542, and Vicar General of the Diocese under Primate Cromer for two years. Though evidently accepting the Royal Supremacy — he styled Henry VIII \" Supreme head on earth of the English and Irish Church \" (D.R.) — he seems to have refused to accept the Reformed Service Books under Edward VI, because they involved changes of doctrine. On account of his opposition he was in October, 155 1, deprived by the Crown of his title of \" Primate of All Ireland,\" and he soon afterwards fled from Ireland. (See below.) 1552 — Hugh Goodacre, on Dowdall's flight and abandonment of his See, was appointed by the Crown, 28 Oct., 1552, and consecrated Feb. 2, 1553. He d. in Dublin May i, 1553, and was bur. in St. Patrick's Cathedral on the same day. — {Reg. of St. Patrick's.) 1553 — George Dowdall re-appointed. Queen Mary issued a mandate for his recall on Nov. 23, 1553, and in his Patent of appointment by her. Mar. 12, 1554, he is said to have been \" deprived of the Primacy and Archbishopric con- trary to justice.\" Queen Mary, a Roman Catholic, seems to have had no doubt about his having been lawful Primate and Archbishop, though Wauchope was the Primate ap- Archbishops of Armagh. 5 pointed by the Pope. In a Consistorial Act of 23 Jan., 1553, he is proposed without being named for the Arch- bishopric of Armagh as \"he who at another time, without the provision of the ApostoHc See had interfered in the government of it \" — (Brady's Episcopal Succ. I., p. 218). He died in London Aug. 15, 1558. On the death of Dowdall, Terence Daniel, the Dean, was appointed guardian of the spiritualities, and was actually- recommended for appointment to the Primacy (see Deans). The Crown, however, appointed in 1562— Adam Loftus, B.D. (Cant.). He had been pres. by Philip and Mary to V. Gedne (Lincoln) 13 May, 1557. Translated Aug. 8, 1567, to Dublin ; d. in the Palace of St. Sepulchre's, Dublin, April 5, 1605 ; bur. in S. Patrick's Cathedral, DubHn. 1568 — Thomas Lancaster. He seems to have been consecrated as Bishop of Kildare in July, 1550, and again as Archbishop of Armagh on 13 June, 1568 ! (See Guardian 18 Nov., 1896). He d. in 1584, and was bur. in St. Peter's, Drogheda, in the vault of Primate Octavian. His Will was proved in 1585 (Dublin Consistorial Collection). 1584 — John Long, D.D.

DEANS. [1206-16 — \" Richard, Dean \" witnesses between these years a confirmation by Archbishop Eugenius {Chart. St. Mary's Abbey I., 149), but as his name follows those of inferior dignity he was probably not Dean of Armagh, but a rural Dean.] 1238 — Marcus appears {Cal. Doc. I, Ap. 4, 1238 ; P. R. Eng.), [1246 — G appears as \"Arch-Presbiter,\" i.e., either Dean or Rural Dean {Cal. Doc. I., 2910). 1256 — Abraham O'Connellan, \" Arch-Presbiter of the Church of Armagh,\" is placed by Cotton among the Deans. Query, was he Rural Dean ? He was made Archbishop in 1257.] 1256 — Joseph appears {Cod. Clar. 46) and is Dean till 1262 {Chart. St. Mary's Abb. I, 327. His seal is given in the Dublin Penny Journal, Vol. II, 112. The matrix is in the Museum of the R.I.A. (see Reeves in U.J. A., Original Series, IV, 219, and C.F. Ill, 375). 1283 — Henry de Ardagh. Protection to Master Henry de Ardagh, Dean of St. Patrick's, Armagh, going to Ireland {P.R. Eng., Vol. for I279ff., p. 56). 1293 — Brieius — Dean of Armagh, pays for certain tithes at Easter in this year {Cal. Doc. I. 1293, p. 18). Cotton puts his date as 1272, and says he was Dean in the time of Abp. Nicholas and so continued about 30 years, and that his name appears to a deed of 1301, giving Reg. Swayne and Reeves' Down, p. 248, as his authorities. But Cotton evi- dently made a mistake. It is probable that the clause about the deed was intended to follow Denis, who suc- ceeded. 1301 — Denis was Dean till 1330 {D.R.). His name appears to a deed of 1301. In 1303 he was elected Archbishop by the Dean and Chapter, but declined it {D.R.). He is men- tioned in the Pipe Rolls of 1313 as owing £g for a carucate of land in Colverton, Co. I^outh. In 1319, acting for Roland the Primate, absent in England, he confirmed the election of Michael Mcl,oughlin to the Bishopric of Derry. In 1325 he is witness to the publication of a Papal Bull at Armagh {Theiner, p. 229 ; Coleman's Stuart, p. 114). 1334 — David O'Hiraghty appears to have been Dean, being promoted this year to the Archbishopric {Cal. Pap. Lett. 11, 1335)- 1362 — Christopher O'Fearghila, Dean, is deceased this year {CaL Pap. Pet., p. 533). 8 Deans of Armagh. 1362 — Patrick O'Korry [O'Curry] succeeds him {D.R.). The appointment was confirmed by Pope Urban V on 7 Ides Aug., 1366 {Cal. Pap. Pet., p. 533 ; Cal. Pap. Lett., IV, 63). He is living in 1370 {D.R.). 1372 — Odo Mecdanim, Dean, is witness to a deed, dated 7 Sep., 1372 {Cal. Ch. Ch. Deeds, 216). He was Dean in 1374 {D.R.). 1380 — Maurice O'Corry, called Deory in Cod. Clar. 46, but Maurice O'Corrj- under 1397 (cp. V.B. at Armagh). He was deprived in 1398. Cotton has Maurice O'Dovey as Dean in 1372 — evidently wrong. 1398 — John O'Goband [O'Gowan]. Papal mandate to Abp. of Armagh to collate him (being a priest of the Diocese of Kilmore) to the Deaner>^ of Armagh, value not ex- ceeding 70 marks, void by the death of Odo Mecdanim, Maurice O'Corri, priest, who unlawfully detains it being re- moved {Cal. Pap. Lett. V, 180). 1406 — Thomas O'Lucheran who had been a Canon in 1397, appears as Dean in 1406 {D.R.). He was also R. Donough- more, q.v. In 1414 Denis O'Culean, who received a Papal mandate to be made Dean — value not exceeding 60 marks — and R. Donoughmore, reports that Thomas O'Lucheran, Dean of Armagh, has been guilty of simony and that he (Denis) cannot safeh- meet him in the city of Armagh. The Pope commands the Abbot of Newry to examine these charges and deprive Thomas {Cal. Pap. Lett. VI, 477). O'lyucheran died in 1416. 1416 — [Deanery- is vacant. See C.F. Ill, 62]. 1416 — Denis O'Culean (see above) was probably appointed Dean about this time. He appears as Dean in D.R. from 1425 to 1441. 1443 — Charles O'Mellan is Dean to 1475 {D.R. ; see King's Primacy, p. 41.) 1477 — Thomas Machamayl []\\IacCav,'ell] binds himself for the first fruits of the Deanery vacant \" per devolutionem ad Curiam \" June 6 {Ann. Hih. 8). He was Dean in 1485 {D.R.), and must have died soon afterwards. 1487 — Peter O'MuImoy [O'Molloy] binds himself for the first fruits of the Deanery vacant \" per cbitum Thome Macha- mayl \" and for the Priory of the Culdees vacant \" certo modo,\" April 26 {Ann. Hib. 9 ; see also Ann. Hih. 23 and MS. T.C.D. F. 4. 30). He seems to have been deprived of the Deanery in 1492, but was probably restored again. Deans of Armagh. 9 1492 — Donald Macrivayr a priest of Clogher Diocese binds himself for the first fruits of the Deanery, vacant \" per privationem in forma juris,\" and for the R. of Donagh- more (Clogher Diocese) and the Priory of the Culdees, Feb. II {Ann. Hib. 10). 1505 — Peter O'Mulmoy [O'Molloy] vacates the Deanery by death {Ann. Hib. 12). 1505 — Edmund Mackmayll [MacCawell] binds himself for the first fruits of the Deanery and Priory of the Culdees vacant through O'Molloy's death {Ann. Hib. 12). He appears again in 1518, and in 1548 his name is written\" McAvenyll \" {D.R.). He died on St. Agnes's Day, Jan. 21, 1549 (Reeves' Ancient Churches of Armagh, U.J. A. Original Series, IV, 21). 1550 — Terence Daniel, called in Irish Tirlagh O' Donnelly, first appears as Dean of Armagh on 30 April, 1550, when \" Terence Danyell, Dean of Armagh,\" had a pardon (Morrin's P.R., Vol. I, 202). He was probably Dean in 1549, for the Dean of Armagh then complains of Con O'Neill {Cal. Carew Pap. I, 217). He was a member of the ancient and noble family of the Ua Donnghaile, who at a remote date settled in the County of Tyrone, in the parish of Donaghmore, at a place called after them, Baile O'Donghaile (Bally O'Donnelly), now known as Castlecaulfield. The family name was derived from DonnghAi, fourth in de- scent from Domhnall, King of Ailech, son of Aed Finnliath, monarch, who d. in 879. (See App. to O'Donovan's Four Masters, pp. 2426-2430). The head of this family was hereditary Marshal of O'Neill's forces. Shane O'Neill, son of the first Earl of Tyrone, was fostered with Tirlagh O'Donnelly at Ballydonnelly ; and the Dean acted for many years as a mediator between the Crown and Shane, whose strongest supporters were the O'Donnellys. Terence Daniel's name appears in many State Papers of the period. We give as follows a short calendar of passages in which his name appears : — 1550,May 31 — Terence Danyell, Dean, appointed Master or Rector of the College of the Culdees (D.R.). 1551, Oct. 27 — Marshal Bagenal to Lord Deputy, states \" the Dean of Armagh gives false information as to the distance of Shane O'Neill's country.\" (S.P.I.). 1553, June 9— He carries letters to the North (S.P.I.). 1553, Nov. 20 — Queen Mary gave \" a grant of English liberties to Terence or Tirlagh O'Dougale of the Irish nation and blood ; . . . and confirmed the estate ... he had in the Deanery of Armagh \" (P.R.). 1554-5 — Named by Queen Mary in Commission for Co. Meath and in a Commission for Co. Louth and Drogheda, 1556-7 {P.E.). 0 Dean Daniel or O'Donnelly. 1558, July 5 — Presided as Primate's Commissary at a Diocesan Synod, held at St. Peter's, Drogheda {D.R.). 1559, May 4 — Instituted, as Guardian of the Spiritualities, sede vacante, Thos. aynche to the Preb. of Duleek (D.R.). 1559, July 3 — Presided at a Synod of the Clergy \" inter Anglos \" at St. Peter's, Drogheda (D.R.), and on Aug. 18 instituted William Pomrell to St. Pete/'s, Drogheda. 1559 — Shane O'Neill sends letters to the Queen by him, and on Sep. 18, 1560, he with Patrick, Dean of TuUyhog, and Sir John Garvie are Shane's Commissioners to negotiate with the Lord Deputy (S.P.I.) 1561 — In answer to a conge d'clire sent to the Dean and Chapter to elect Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Armagh, he says : \" that the Chapter there, whereof the greater part be temporall men and Shane O'Nele's horsemen be sparkeled and owte of ordre as he can by no meanes assemble them to procede to the election \" [S.P.I ; see also Shirley's Letters, 45, 120). 1562, May 5— Is appointed by Queen Elizabeth one of the Comrs. to hear and determine controversies between Shane and gentlemen of the Pale (8.P.I.). 1562— July 31, Aug. 1, Aug. 17, Aug. 27. He and John Garvie, Archdeacon of Meath, confer, for the Crown, with O'Neill [S.P.I.). 1562 — Is named with others on Dec. 6 by the Queen, one of the Com- missioners to exercise spiritual jm-isdiction and correct errors, etc., in the Province of Armagh (P.R.). 1563 — Minute in Cecil's handwriting, dated Wyndsor, 7 Aug., 1563 — that the Dean of Armagh may be Primate — that the Primate may be Bp. of Kildare and Dean of St. Patrick's— that the Bp. of Kildare may be Bp. of Meathe — the chantor of Armagh [Patrick Darelle] to be Deane. Daniel ...\" wold promesse to doe moch with Shane O'Neyle and some think he cold performe it \" (Shirley's Letters, p. 124). On Oct. 15 the Queen writes similarly to Sussex (S.P.I.). Loftus was, however, appointed Primate. 1563 — Helps to make agreement with O'Neill that, inter alia \" at the feast of All SS. tlie ward is to be removed from the Church of Armagh and the Church shall be restored to O'Neill \" (S.P.I.). O'Neill gives a bond at Benburb Nov. 16 \"for the restoration of the Church of Armagh to Divine Service as her Majesty has removed her garrison therefrom at his petition \" (S.P.I.). The Dean is desired to remain in the North, that his presence may have a good effect with O'Neill (see Hore, U. J. A., Orig. Series, VIII, 56). When Richard Creagh, appointed Primate by the Pope, brought letters from the latter to Shane, he found O'Neill desirous that the see should be given to Daniel {Ibidem ; see also Shirley's Letters, pp. 163-171). Several letters of Daniel in 1564 and 1565 to the Lords Justices show he was acting intermediary with O'Neill. In Oct., 1564 he was appointed on a Commission with the Primate and others to enforce attendance at Church and cause all Bishops to subscribe to the Royal Supremacy (P.R.). In 1565 O'Neill sent him as envoy with presents to the Queen to England (Shirley's Letters,^. 222). [1566, Aug. 16 — Thos. Lancaster reports that O'Neill has broken down the Metropolitan Church of Armagh (S.P.I.). R. Creagh, writing to Cecil, states he did it for the \" safeguard of his coimtry \" ! Shane was slain on June 2, 1567.] 1567, July 6 — The Queen nominates Daniel to be Archbishop (S.P.I. ; see also Shirley's Letters, p. 307). Loftus seems to have worked to prevent his appointment ; and the Archbishopric was given to Thomas Lancaster. Deans of Armagh. ii After Shane O'Neill's death Tnrlogh Leynagh — one of the O'Donnellye — seems to have given much trouble to the Government, which was assisted by the Dean, through whose efforts a treaty was concluded with him on Jan. 20, 1571 and again in 1579. Turlogh died in May, 1583 {S.P.I.). In 1574 we find him writing from Drogheda on April 7 — That he had lost all his goods in the rebellion of Shane O'Neill, and had no profit of his Deanery {8.P.I.). In 1583 he prays to be restored to the Parsonage of Rath wire (Meath), October 20 {8.P.I.). He died in 158.5, and his Will, made 10 Aug., 1585, \" in Edw. Connell's bowse in the new forte at the black watter in the presence of . . . Patrick Melee, Chaplin, Mellaghlene OffaUegane, chapline, and hugh O Shenan, chaplen, with divers others \" was proved before Primate John Long on 9th Feb., 1585-6. In it he desires to be buried in the Cathedral of Armagh, towards the building of which he left £11 \" at ye discrecon of ye Mr. of ye Workes . . . and my nephew, Bamabye Danyell.\" Left certain profits of the parsonage of Rathwire to be divided between his nephew Bamaby and his friend, John Cusacke. His nephew made sole Exor. (See Reeves' MS. Memoirs of the Deans of Armagh for further information concerning him.) 1587 — \" Salamon, servant of Tirlagh Leynagh ... if learned and qualified to have Deanery of Armagh, the Dean [who he was we have not been able to ascertain] being placed elsewhere \" {P.R., May 12, 29 Ehz., No. 46). [1588 — John Garvey, who in March following was translated to the Archbishopric, received \" the Deanery of Armagh \" in commendam with the Bishopric of Kilmore (Morrin's Cat. P.R., 30 Eliz., p. 178, Mar. 21). Query, was this a mistake of Morrin's for \" the Deanery of Kilmore \" ? ; for Wood was Dean in or before 1588. See next entry.] 1588 — Owen Wood was Dean in or before 1588 (Bliss' Wood's Fasti Oxon.). He was a Welshman, second son of Hugh Wood, of Tullylyn, in the Isle of Anglesey (who was second son of William Wood, descended from Wood, of Woodhall, in Ivancashire) by his wife Jane, dau. of Hugh Prys ap Howell, of Mossoglen, Esq. He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he grad. B.A., 1581 ; M.A., 1584, and was probably appointed Dean soon after Terence Daniel's death. He was married in 1595, as appears from a letter, dated 16 Nov., 1595, from Rowland White to Sir Robert Sydney, in which he says: \" My noble and worthy Cosen, Mr. Dean Wood, the Queen's Chaplen, is married to Kitch Ballet's widow of Cheapside ; he hath got by her £300 a yeare Jointer and she is besides worth £4,000 \" (Sydney's Letters and Memorials of State, Vol. I, p. 361). \" Humphreys states Dean Woods wife was Joywan, daughter of Richard Cledden, Chaplain to the Queen and J.

I have collected the following notices of him : — 1589 — \" Eugene Woods, Dean of Armagh,\" is witness to the Will of Ocheus O'Hanlon, 7 May, 1589 (Wills P.R.O.I.). la Dean Wood. 1590, May 11 — Ordered by Lord Deputy Perrot \"to preach on the vanity and absurdity of a Bull of Pius V, found in a house in Ross, which D.

He was the second son of John Maxwell, M.P., of Calderwood, in Lanarkshire, and came to Ireland at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign at the request of King Deans of Armagh. 13 James (VI of Scotland, afterwards I of England) to secure an interest for him in that kingdom (Archdall's Lodge). King James, writing to Sir A. Chichester, July 15, 1609, says that Maxwell \" has painfully laboured [in Ireland] for certain years past in his ministry, and the king designs to confer upon him some ecclesiastical dignity in his gift \" {S.P.I.). It is therefore probably the same who was nom- inated Chancellor of Connor in the Charter of July 20, 1609, and who held that position also in 1622. Cotton thinks that it was a different R.M. who held the Chancellor- ship in 1622, but as a new Chancellor was appointed in 1624, it is more probable that it was vacant then through the Dean's death, which took place after 12 April, 1622. It is said that he debarred himself from further prefer- ment by opposing Primate Henry Ussher, who had intended to lease the See lands of the Primacy in a fee farm grant for £1,500 per annum for ever to a dependant of the Duke of Buckingham on the latter's solicitation {Lodge and Old See Rental). He received a grant of denization 20 May, 1617 {P.R.). He received a grant of the Dean's Demesne in Armagh and also the territory of Derrynoose 27 Feb., 1613 {P.R.). In 1622 he was \" taken with a dead palsie.\" The Deanery was rated in the King's books at £35 ; value £120 ; Resident at Armagh. \" His charge is at the Cathedrall. The Deanery consisteth only in land. He hath a poore house in Ardmagh opposite the land of the Deanery\" (B-V. 1622). He seems to have died the same year. Reid says in his History that he was murdered in 1641 by Sir Phelim O'Neill, but he probably mistook him for his eldest son Robert, Preb. of Tynan (see Arboe and Clonoe), who was not murdered, but who suffered a great deal in 1641. Dean Maxwell married Isabella Seaton of the Scottish Seatons, and had issue Robert (ancestor of the Earls of Farnham), Henry of Finnebrogue, and James, and a daughter Eliza- beth, who married Robert Barclay, Dean of Clogher, and died 29 Aug., 1635 and was bur. in Armagh Cathedral {Funeral Entries). Dean Maxwell is confused by Cotton and others with his son Robert. There is an elaborate pedigree of his family in Ulster's Office (see the several Peerages and Baronetages and Foster's Scottish M.P's.). i622^George Mackeson (or Mackeston) pres. by the Crown Oct. 29 {P.R. ; Cotton has \" Oct. 25 \" in error). On the same day he received Letters of Naturalization in Ireland {P.R.). He was the 2nd son of Alexander M. of Athconry in Scotland ; born circa 1579. I ^^^ \" '^^- Mackeson Lecturer of Christ Church [Dublin] \" mentioned on 15 Feb., 1622 {Ussher' s Works, Vol. XVI, p. 390). He was pres. 14 Deans Mackeson and Frey. by lyord Falkland (to whom he was chaplain) to the Chan- cellorship of Clogher and R. Galloone on May 13, 1624 {P.R. ; Cotton, in error, says he received the Precentor- ship of Clogher by patent from the Crown). He seems to have res. the Chancellorship in 1631, as he does not appear on the Clogher Lists in R. V. 1633. He was pres. a second time, according to Cotton, to the Deanery on May 12, 1627 {P.R.). He gave a good deal cf trouble and annoyance to Primate Jamea Uasher in connection with the Deanery lands. In the time of his pre- decessor. King James had settled 16 townlanda of Dcrrynoose on the Deanery, in Ueu of the Rectories and Vicarages belonging to it which the Dean had surrendered, but tlirough some error, Loughgilly rectory was excepted. Dean Mackeson claimed the right of presentation to it against the Primate and tock proceedings in the King's Courts, but- either withdrew or was defeated in his endeavours. The King, writing to Lord Falkland on May 12, 1627, speaks of the Dean as \" a very able Churchman, who hath received some loss by the not payment of £40 per annum out of the defalcations of his weekly lecture at Christ Church.\" Dean Mackeson m. Dorothy, dau. of Richard Funnett, of Canterbury, by whom he had one son Archibald and three daus. — Ellinor, Margaret, and a third whose name is not recorded. He died at Legacorry (Richhill) on Aug. I3> 1635 {Funeral Entries). He was bur. in Kilmore Church, where a monumental slab has the following in- scription (now partly defaced) around its edges : — \" Georgius Mack[es]on | [qu]ondam[D]ecanus Ecclesiae Cathedralis | [Armachane Prov]|idu8 vir et eximius Predicator vere Divinus | . , . Anno Dni 1635 Aetatis sue 56 | \". See Memorials I, 59. 1635 — James Frey (Fray, Frye, or Fry) ; name variously spelled in F.F.R. of 1635-7 5 was pres. by the Crown (having been recommended by Primate James Ussher) to the Deanery on Sep. 15. His ftdl name was John James Frey, and he was born at Basle on 6 June, 1606, being the son of John Henry Frey, a merchant, and Esther Ostein his wife. From a tract by Daniel Tossanus in the National Library, Dublin, entitled : \" Oratio Panegyrica in obitum Reverendi et Clarissimi viri, Domini M. Jo. Jacobi Frey, Professoris Graeci in Academia patria et Designati Decani Armachani in Hibernia\" (4° Basle, 1636) we learn that at the age of 19, in 1625, he travelled through Switzerland and France and came to England to study in the libraries of Oxford, where he became a member of Christ Church and took his M.A. degree. Becoming acquainted with Robert Boyle, Earl of Cork, he was made tutor to his eldest son, Lord Dungarvan, with whom he came to Ireland and lived in Lismore in Jan., 1630. He was ord. D. in Westminster Abbey on May 16, 1630. He was appointed at the end of 1630 \" Profectus Margaretanae Ecclesiae \" in Basle, to which Deans of Armagh. 15 he had returned. Having again come to Ireland, he travelled with lyord Dungarvan on the Continent, where he seems to have been engaged in researches for Primate Ussher. Soon after he was appointed Professor of Greek in the University of Basle. He m. Catherina Guntzer, dau. of Sebastian Guntzer and widow of James Bernoulli, in 1634. Having been nominated to the Deanery of Armagh, he resolved to come to Ireland for institution, but took suddenly ill, and died in his 29th year on Aug. 26, 1635. Cotton gives the date of patent as \" Nov. 25 \" ; it should be Sep. 15. It is probable that the news of his death had not come to Ireland at the time. It is curious that his name occurs in the First Fruits Returns of 1635, 1636 and 1637. The Deanery must have been vacant until Mar, 1637. (See also Notes and Queries, No. 277, Feb. 17, 1855, and Ussher's Works, Vols. XV and XVI). 1637 — Peter Wentworth, D.D., pres. by the Crown Mar. 4 {P.R.) ; May 29 (F.F.T.). Another Pat. was passed for his pres. on Feb. 23, 1638 {P.R.). He was the son of Thomas Wentworth, Recorder of Oxford, and M.P., and grandson of Sir Nicholas Wentworth, Knt., of Lillingstone-IyOvell, Yorkshire, and a kinsman of the celebrated Earl of Strafford. Reeves, misled by a passage in one of Laud's Letters {Works VII, 296), gives him in error a different parentage. (See History of Three Branches of the Family of Wentworth, by WiUiam Loftie, Rutton, London, 1891). He entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, 13 March, 1618, and afterwards became a Fellow of Balliol Coll ; B.A., 1621 ; D.D., 1633. His sermons before the University are said to have con- verted some of the members from puritanical notions. Laud refers to him in his Letters to Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, Lord Deputy of Ireland ; thus on Nov. 15, 1636, he says : — \" I hear ycu have found out Dr. Wentworth at Oxford [the patent was not passed till the following year] . . . The man hath good parts in him. This summer I heard him preach well to the King at Wood- stock. If he can master his learning it will never be the worse for him. I believe the Primate will like liim well.\" Again, on Dec. 5, he says, \" God give Dr. Wentworth joy of the Deanery, and though I do not think his name only got him the prefer- ment from you, yet ceteris 'paribus you had no reason to pass his name over\" (Laud's Works VII, 296 and 300). And again, April 7, 1637, he speaks of \" the soberness of his carriage, and the goodness of his learning and of so well-tempered a disposition \" (VIII, 339-40). It seems, from a letter of Laud to Strafford on Nov. 15, 1636, that the Earl of Leicester desired the Deanery for his Secretary — \" a deacon, young, with nothing in him or about him like a man in Orders, with long hair, his clothes all in the fashion,\" and to Laud's eyes \" moat unfit every way to be a prime Dean \" (VII, 296). i6 Deans Wentworth and Marsh. During the vacancy in the Deanery, a new Charter incor- porating the Dean and Chapter was issued by the Crown, and a settlement was, after the death of John Symons, R. of Armagh, in 1637, arrived at, whereby the Rectory and Vicarage of Armagh (with the R. and V. Clonaule, Clonconchy and Ballymoyer) were united to the Deanery ; and the Deanery surrendered, in return, to the Primate the territory of Derrynoose. This settlement was long afterwards, however, held to be void in law. Dean Went- worth fled from Ireland in Oct., 1641, on the outbreak of the rebellion, and was made Archdeacon of Carlisle by Abp. Ussher, then having the oversight of the diocese of Carlisle. Carlisle was besieged and taken in 1645 by the Parliamentary Forces, so that he could have profited little by the change. He lived obscurely during the Com- monwealth and had charge of the parish of Buriton, Hamp- shire, in Jan., 1658. In 1660 he refused to return to Ireland even to accept a Bishopric there, and res. his Archdeaconry and accepted the R. of Great Hasely in Oxfordshire. He d. at Bath, July 22, 1661, aged 60, and was buried there in the Abbey Church near the grave of Bishop James Montague. In his epitaph engraven on a brass plate fastened to a plain white stone lying over his grave he is thus characterised : \" Patriciorum proles, Doctrinae Maritus, Summus Hyberniae Decanus, Angliae praeconuin primus.\" The celebrated Henry Stubbe (ob. 1676), the Bath Physician, was buried in his grave. Wentworth's arms are emblazoned on the windows of Balliol College, Oxford, in token of his being a benefactor to it. His widow held lands in the parish of Glendermot, Derry {C.F. Ill, 331). He left an only son Thomas, who died young. (See History of Three Branches of Family of Wentworth, and Wood's Fasti Oxon.). Cotton erroneously states that William Sley was pres. to the Deanery in 1643. See Chancellors. 1661 — Francis Marsh, D.D., pres. by the Crown, June 19 (P.R.). He was the son of Henry and grandson of Francis M., both of Edgworth in Gloucestershire, where he was born 23 Oct., 1626. He was educated at Emmanuel and Caius College, Cambridge, of which last he became a Fellow like his father-in-law the great Bishop Jeremy Taylor. That Prelate invited him over to Ireland in 1660. On Jan 26, 1661, he was admitted M.A. ad eundem of Dublin Uni- versity. Taylor was consecrated Bishop of Down and Connor on Jan. 27, and one of his first acts was to ordain Marsh, then 35 years old, deacon and priest on the same Deans of Armagh. 17 day. Marsh was pres. to the Deanery of Connor on Feb. 8, 1661, which he res. in June for the Deanery of Armagh. In 1664 he became also Archdeacon of Dromore and R. Clonfeakle, which he held with the Deanery till 1667, when he was consecrated Bishop of Limerick on Dec. 22 at Clonmel. He held with the Bishopric, in com- mendam, the R. Tradery in Killaloe {S.P.I.). On Jan. 10, 1673, he was translated to Kilmore with Ardagh, and on Feb. 14, 1681, was promoted to the Archbishopric of Dublin with which he held in comniendam the Treasurership of St. Patrick's, Dublin, and the Prebend of Desertmore, Cork. (See Mason's St. Patrick's, p. 202). He fled from Dubhn in 1688-9, leaving Dr. Wm. King (afterwards Archbishop) as his Commissary, and was attainted by King James's Parlia- ment. He returned soon after the Revolution, and died on Nov. 16, 1693, at the Palace of St. Sepulchre's and was buried in Christ Church near the Communion Table, but no monument to him now remains. He m. Mary, 2nd dau. of Bishop Jeremy Taylor, who survived him. They had three children, the second of whom, Jeremiah Wm., b. 1667, T.C.D. B.A. 1686, D.D. 1700, succeeded his father in Treasurership of St. Patrick's a few days before his death ; became Dean of Kilmore in 1700, and died in 1734. By his 2nd wife Elizabeth, dau. of Dr. Simon Digby, Bishop of Elphin, the latter had a son Jeiemy, b. 1712, who became R. Athenry and d. 1790, leaving three sons (1) Francis, ancestor of the Queen's County Marshs ; (2) Robert, a clergyman, father of the late Sir Henry Marsh, Bart., M.D. ; and (3) Digby, S.F.T.C.D., who died in 1791 (see Life of Jer. Taylor, p. 354). The Bible and other relics of Abp. Francis Marsh are in the possession of Col. Jeremy Taylor Marsh, R.E., of London. Mr. Garstin, F.S.A., has at Braganstown a fuU pedigree and a collection for a history of the family. Francis Marsh should not be confounded with his namesake Narcissus Marsh, whom he consecrated, and who succeeded him in the Archbishopric of Dublin, where he founded \" Marsh's Library \" in St. Patrick's Close, and eventually became Primate (see also Baronetages and B.L.G.; Evdyn's Diary' oi Feb. 26, 1680; C.F., etc.). His Will, a very short one, dated Oct. 24, 1693, bequeathed all his estate real and personal to his wife Mary, who was sole Exor. ; £5 to his eldest son Francis ; £10 to his dau. Barbara Chantrell ; £20 to his son Jeremy with all his books. Will was proved 20 Nov., 1693. 1667 — James Downham (or Downam) — described as D.D. — pres. Oct. 29 [Lih. Mun., but Book of Pres. has Aug. 29) ; inst. Jan. 10, 1667-8 {Bishops Returns). He was the son of George Downham, Bishop of Derry, by his first wife Anne, dau. of William Harrison, Preb. of Windsor {Funeral Entries and Bliss's Wood's Fasti Oxon.). In 1634 his father appointed him Preb. of Moville. In 1655 we find him Commonwealth Minister at Ballyshannon ; and Minister at Moville from 24 Dec, 1656, at ;^I20 per annum {Comm. Papers). In 1661 he was made Preb. of Tynan {q.v.) and R. i8 Deans Downham and Vigors. Derry noose, which he res. on being made Dean. With the Deanery he held also the R. and V. of Armagh. The Patents for the Deanery aeem to have been expensive in those daya, for we find (S.P.I. 1661-9, p. 471) a letter from Sh- Geo. Rawdon to Viscount Conway, dated 16 Oct., 1667, saying \" the Deans of Armagh and Connor are both to seek for £200 or more to pass their Patents and ceremonies. ... I cannot help them as I desire.\" In S.P.I. 1666-9, p. 674, dat. iMarch, 1668, \"Mr. Downam \" is described as \" Dean, a grave man £400 [income].\" His step-mother. Dame Margery Roe (widow of Sir Francis Roe), who between 1616 and 1622 m. Bishop Downham as his 3rd wife, leaves in her Will, proved 1656, her house, churchlands, cliattels and plate to her \" well beloved sonne-in-law Jame^ Downham, sen and heir to the late Bishop of Derry \" as her best friend, and sole Exor. Under this will lands in Ballyclog, Desertcreat, and Clonoe passed to him. He died in 1681, and by Lis P. Will, made 10 June, 1681, proved 13 July, 1681, he left to his dau. .Jane Coy)e his ready money and plate, and to his daus. Jane [wife of Walter Cope of Drumilly] and Ann [wife of Arthur] Newborough the residue of his estate in equal shares. i68i — Bartholomew Vigors, pres. by the Crown June 29 {P.R.) ; inst. July 5 {F.F.T.). On Oct. 10 of the same year he was coll. to R. and V. Armagh, and inst. R. and V. Clonfeacle on the pres. of T.C.D. He held these livings with the Deanery. His grandfather, Rev. Louis Vigors, b. 1578 of a North Devon family was the first of the name to settle in Ireland, was ord. D. and P. 5 Nov., 1603, by Bishop of Exeter ; in 1615 was beneficed in the Diocese of Ross, where he became Treasurer of the Cathedral in 1631, and died in Devonshire in 1642, as did his widow in 1651. Their son. Urban Vigors, was beneficed 1634-7 in the Dioceses of Cork and Ross, and in 1645 was Chaplain to the 1st Earl of Orrery. He m. about 1635 Catherine Boyle, sister of Richard. Bishop of Ferns, and Robert, Bishop of Clogher. Their eldest son. Urban, of Old Leighlin, was High Sheriff of Carlow County in 1700 and ancestor of the Carlow family of Vigors. Their 4th son was Bartholomew. (See B.L.O.I.). Bartholomew Vigors was b. at Bishops Tauton, Devon, 1643 ; bapt. 18 Feb. ; ent. T.C.D. May 23, 1663 ; Sch. 1663 ; LIv.B. 1666 ; I^I^.D. 1675. The editor of Wood's Athenae who calls him \" Balthazar Viguris \" states that he was a member of Exeter College and afterwards M.A. of St. Alban's Hall, Oxford ; ord. D. at Wexford Feb. 10, 1667, and P. at Leighlin June 11, 1667 ; was V. Tacum- shane 1667-81 ; Vicar-General of Ferns 1666-81 ; Chanc. Ferns 1668-81 ; R. Wexford 1673-81. Eminent as an ecclesi- astical lawyer, being joined in Commissions of Visitation with Dudley Loftus in 1679 and 1681. In 1691 he was consecrated Bishop of Ferns on Mar. 8 at Christ Church Cathedral. He died on Jan 3, 1721 and was bur. in the memorable tomb of his relative the \" Great \" Earl of Cork in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He m. about 1674 Martha, sister of Bev. Benjamin Neale, Archdeacon of Leighlin, by whom he had one son and six daus. By his P. Deans op Armagh. 19 Will, proved 1721, he left a farm value £548, and £300 to enrich the See of Leighlin ; and he built a \" manse house.\" The late Col. P. D. Vigors, of Holloden, Bagenalstown, left a large MS. collection for a history of the family of Vigors. (See C.F. II and III ; Ware's Bishops ; Reeves' Memoirs of Deans; B.L.G.I.). 1691 — Peter Drelineourt, pres. by the Crown Feb. 28 to Deanery, R. Armagh and R. Clonfeacle [P.R.) ; inst. Mar. 14 {D.R.) ; T.C.D. M.A. 1681 ; IvI..D. 1691. He was the 6th son of Charles Drelineourt, a well-known writer and pastor of the Reformed Church in France, who was born in Paris Julj'- 22, 1644 and who d. in 1696. He received Holy Orders and came to Ireland, and was made Chaplain to the Duke of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant, and private tutor of his grandson while a student at Oxford. Became Prec. Christ Church, Dublin 1681-1722 ; Archdeacon of Leighhn 1683- 91, and R. Powerstown and Shankill (Leighlin) 1683-92. He published \" A Speech to the Duke of Ormond and Privy Council to return the humble thanks of the French Protestants,\" etc., 4° Dublin, 1682. He does not seem to have resided much at Armagh, more frequently in London, and sometimes in Dublin. \" He was very generous with his money, — during his lifetime beauti- fying the Cathedral, building a church at St. Dolough's and founding an educational hospital for boj'-s in Dublin \" (French's Protestant Exiles II, 222). He died in London on March 7, 1722, aged 76. Hia widow erected a beautiful monument to his memory in Armagh Cathedral with a recumbent figure of the Dean, — the work of the famous sculptor Rysbrack. The long Latin inscription and English elegy carved thereon are given in Rogers' Memoir of Armagh Cathedral, pp. 134-5, and a translation in Stuart's Armagh, p. 519. Archbishop King does not geem to have held the same opinion of him as the writer of this inscription, for, writing to Primate Lindsay circa 1722, he says \" Your Grace is sensible what a clog and how useless the last Dean was to the Church.\" The date of his death is erroneously given in both P.ogers and Stuart \" 8 March, 1720 \" and on the monument \" 7 March, 1720,\" while the Historical Register for 1722 has \" March 15, Dyed Peter Drelineourt, Dean of Armagh ;\" and in the Appeal Case to the Lords concerning the Rectory of Armagh (Crown v. Primate) it is said he died on \" 8th March, 1721 \" [i.e., 1721-2]. The monument further errs in saying he was but 75 year^* of age. By his Will, made Jan. 19, 1716, proved in London in the Perogative Court of Canterbury, he leaves all his real estate to his wife Mary, who was sole Exor., subject to £200 to be given to his dau. Ann as a marriage portion, but if she marries Avith her mother's consent [as she did] she is to receive £5,000 more, otherwise £2,000 to be given to Mrs. D's. relatives and £3,000 to be disposed as follows— viz., £700 to build a charity school on his estate in Wales, £800 to be given to the \" Blew Boys Hospital in Dublin,\" £500 for the use of the poor of the ConformiBt French Church at Dublin, and £1,000 to be laid out in pious 20 Deans Drelincourt and Daniel. and charitable uses in either of the parbhes of Armagh or Clonfeacle ; he also bequeathed £100 to his god-daughter, Mary Margaret, dau. of Archdeacon Maurice. (See Desertcreat). His widow founded the Drelincourt School at Armagh in 1732, and died in May or June, 1755 ; and his dau., who m. in 1739 Hugh, 3rd Viscount Primrose, died in 1775, leaving £1,000 to Armagh, which was utilised in providing a water supply for the city. (See also Stuart's Armagh ; Bayle's General Dictionary, Vol. IV, London, 1736 ; Agnew's Protestant Exiles from France, II and III ; Burn's History of Foreign Protestant Refugees ; Swift's Works ; Mrs. Delany's Autobiography ; and Reeves' MS. Memoirs of the Deans). 1722 — Richard Daniel, pres. by the Crown June 28 ; inst. July 5 ; installed July 30 {D.R.). Owing to a lease given by the late Dean for 21 years, the profits of the Deanery were then reduced to less than £100 per annum {Letter of Abp. King to Primate Lindsay). The Primate therefore wished both Rectory and Deanery of Armagh to continue united and to be given to Nathaniel Whaley. The latter was not a persona grata to the Government, who pres. Daniel to the Deanery. The Primate coll. Whaley to the Rectory. The Crown then claimed the advowson of the Rectory and pres. Daniel to it in 1723, and in 1727 brought a writ of Quare impedit. The House of Lords decided on appeal that the right of pres. to the R. was not for that time vested in the Crown. Richard Daniel was a son of Henry Daniel , lawyer ; was born in Dublin about 1681 ; ent. T.C.D. July, 1696 ; B.A. 1701 ; M.A. 1704 ; ord D. Jan. 10, 1704; P. April 18, 1705 ; held the Archdeaconry of Killaloe 1714-32, which he res. with the Deanery of Armagh for the Deanery of Down 18 Feb., 1731-2. He published : — A Dream, or an Elegaic Poem occasioned by the Death of William III. (4to, Dublin, 24pp., 1702.) A Poem on the Return of His Majesty King George from Hanover (Fol., Lond., 8 pp., 1717). A Paraphrase on some Select Psalms (8vo., Dublin, 132 pp., 1722). The Royal Penitent — A Paraphrase on the Seven Penitential Psalms (Svo, Lond., 64 pp., 1727). He does not seem to have resided in Armagh during his tenure of the Deanery. He was twice married. His 2nd wife was Cassandra, 4th dau. of John Cooke, of Cookesboro', Co. Westmeath (M.L. dated 11th July, 1715) by Elizabeth, dau. of Col. Foster, of Pimlico, near Dublin, sister of Bishop Nicholas Foster, of Raphoe. His eldest dau. Anne, bapt. 1719, m. 10 March, 1738, Clotworthy, 5th Viscount and Ist Earl of Massereene as his first wife, and d.s.p. 24 Mar., 1740. Another dau., Elizabeth, m. Simon Digby, M.P., 1749, and d. 21 Jan., 1755. Another was the first wife of the imfortunate John McNaghten (see U.J. A. VIII, 134). Dean Daniel died on 30 April, 1739, and was buried in St. Michan's Church, Dublin, on 2nd May (Register). His P. Will, made 15 March, 1738, was proved on 7 May, 1739. He left £100 towards rebuilding Downpatrick Cathedral, £200 to the Bluecoat Hospital, £100 to Steeven's Hospital, £100 to Mrs. Mercer's Deans of Armagh. 21 Hospital, £50 to St. Michan's Charity Boys and Girls. Bequeathed to his daus. Elizabeth and Mary £4,000 and real estate after his wife Cassandra's death. Desired to be buried in St. Michan's in Lord Blaney's vault, where his fii-st wife and two children were buried. Mentions his \" sister Marlay \" and his \" sister Mitchell.\" He seems to have owned seven or eight Rectories in Kerry (Smith's History of Kerry ; see Reeves' MS. Memoirs of the Deans). 1731-2 — John Brandreth, pres. by the Crown March 21 (P.R.) ; inst. March 24 ; installed March 31 {D.R.). Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became B.A. 1717 ; M.A. 1721, and also Fellow. Came over to Ireland as Chaplain to the Duke of Dorset, Lord Lieutenant, and tutor to his eldest son. Lord Middlesex ; was Preb. of Cloneamery (Ossory) and R. Knocktopher 1730-6 ; succeeded Daniel as Archdeacon of Killaloe as well as in the Deanery, but usually resided at Knocktopher. In 1736 he res. his three dignities for the more lucrative post of Chancellor of Armagh and R. Kilmore, exchanging the Deanery of Armagh with Dr. James Auchmuty for the Deanery of Emly. It does not appear that he ever married. His P. Will, dated 29 August, was proved 25 October, 1764. In it he left the Rev. Dr. Richard Wilmot, his wife Dorothy W., and his son Staunton W. all his estate in the parish of Mouseley, in Leicestershire, and his estate in the manors of Balsall and Barstown, Warwickshire ; to Rev. George Brough, R. of Staunton, his two houses in Tamwerk ; to his Curates in Kilmore (Thos.
