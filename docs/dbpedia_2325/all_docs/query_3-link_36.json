        "text": "Archbishop of Armagh\n\nFace coverings are the new Church norm, as faith leaders unite to ask for masks\n\n\"It has become increasingly clear that the wearing of face coverings is likely to reduce the spread of coronavirus, thus helping to protect others,\" say Irish Church leaders.\n\nNew Church of Ireland Primate pays tribute to the GAA\n\n\"Surely the most remarkable and influential cultural and sporting organisation in Ireland today” - Archbishop John McDowell.\n\nArchbishop drops-in to Simon Community hostel in Armagh\n\nIt was humbling to visit Simon Armagh to offer our support and to speak and pray with the residents and staff, says Archbishop Martin.\n\nThe name of God is Mercy, says Archbishop of Armagh\n\n“We are at a Kairos, a turning point, a time of opportunity,” said Archbishop Eamon Martin on Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nWe will come through pandemic, as surely as Christ rose at Easter, says Dr Eamon Martin\n\n\"We will come through this, hopefully as better people, strengthened by the experience,\" says Archbishop of Armagh.\n\nCall to Pray at 3 p.m. today\n\nIreland’s Church leaders are calling on the faithful of all denominations to join in prayer from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. today.\n\nThe initiative is in response to the absence of normal Palm Sunday liturgies because of the ban on public communal worship during this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Catholic [...]\n\nChurch is showing solidarity while ‘distancing’ says Archbishop Eamon Martin\n\n“I may be looking out at empty pews, but in my mind’s eye and with the eyes of my heart, I can see you in your living rooms, in nursing homes, hospital wards or perhaps driving in your cars, all linked spiritually in the ‘family of families’ that is the Church,” said Archbishop Eamon Martin.\n\nPrimate’s St Patrick’s Day prayer in pandemic : ‘Dia idir sin agus an olc’\n\n\"When we ask God for his protection, like St Patrick did, we are asking for serenity and peace of mind,\" says Archbishop Eamon Martin amid rising anxiety about coronavirus spread.\n\nBishop John McDowell elected as new Church of Ireland Primate\n\nCatholic Church leaders welcome the House of Bishops' selection of the Bishop of Clogher as Archbishop Richard Clarke's successor.\n\nPrayers for Purfleet: Archbishop of Armagh appeals for help to end human trafficking\n\n“Let us resolve to raise awareness, to keep our eyes open and to cooperate at all levels of society for an end to this evil in our midst,” says Archbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh.\n\nLaudato Tree project aims to create corridor of trees across Africa\n\n“I think this project could especially catch the imagination of the young people of Ireland, in their youth groups, schools, colleges and workplaces,” said Archbishop Eamon Martin.\n\nMarch for their Lives protests Northern Ireland abortion law\n\n\"More than 20,000 people, from every tradition, attended the March because people are outraged that Westminster has hijacked our democratic process and has sought to impose abortion on Northern Ireland.\"\n\nBringing faith to politics is not an optional extra, Archbishop Martin tells summer school\n\n“These values are defended by the Church precisely because they are human even before they are Christian; they are rooted in the natural law and accessible to reason.”\n\n“This sculpture is much more than a work of art”\n\nArchbishop Eamon Martin unveils new statue of St Oliver Plunkett by Dony MacManus in honour of martyrs yesterday, today and tomorrow.\n\nEucharistic adoration to become more prevalent as Mass numbers decline\n\n“In the future when weekday and even Sunday Mass is not available, some of you might be formed to lead a period of guided adoration with prayers, praise and sharing of the Word of God.”\n\nBe fearless in your work to restore hope, Armagh Archbishops say in joint Easter message\n\n“We can use the energy and power of Christ’s resurrection to bring hope and purpose into our own lives and into the lives of others.”\n\nUnite behind pro-life medical professionals, Bishop urges\n\n“Catholics and people who hold that all human life is sacred from the first moment of conception have no obligation whatsoever to obey this law.”\n\nArchbishops urge faithful to think of the homeless this Christmas\n\n“Think for a moment of what it would be like this Christmas to be without a home. To be without a place of shelter. To be out in the cold. To be on your own, living on the streets.”\n\nBishops’ online Advent calendar has more features than ever\n\n\"Advent also prepares us for the second coming of Christ at the end of time. As Christians, we must always be prepared for the coming of the Lord.\" – Archbishop Eamon Martin.\n\n“To remember the dead is important to the practice of our faith.”\n\nCan we learn from their shared sacrifice, a full century after the so-called “war to end all wars’? asks Archbishop Eamon Martin in an interfaith service in Belfast.\n\nPilgrimage of hope and peace to Ulster and Irish war graves\n\n“The pilgrimage will be a witness to hope and will enable us to forge even greater friendships and work yet harder for peace together in the future.”\n\nNew book of meditations by CofI Archbishop launched\n\n‘Shouldering the Lamb: Reflections on an Icon’ by Dr Richard Clarke of Armagh contains 11 meditations on the ancient figure of the shepherd carrying a lamb across his shoulders.\n\nReconcile the Reformation and build Church Unity\n\nI am convinced that in the midst of an increasingly secular world, we in the various Christian traditions are called to combine our efforts, says Archbishop Eamon Martin\n\nPrimate cautions against “disrespect for life” in rush to repeal 8th\n\n“I think there is a huge groundswell for the protection of life.”\n\nPrimate outlines vision for parishes and dioceses of the future\n\n“It will be impossible for us to hold on to the ways we lived parish in the past. The parishes of tomorrow will be ‘communities of intentional disciples’ sustained by committed and formed lay people.”\n\nFestival Day of St Oliver Plunkett to be celebrated today\n\n\"In new and unfamiliar countries the Irish pub, GAA club, provide a kind of home from home, a familiar place to gather, but so too the Church can provide a sense of home from home.”\n\nRelics of St Oliver Plunkett return to Kilmore\n\nOn Tuesday 7 June, the relics will arrive at Kilmore diocesan centre at 10am and will be available for veneration until 10pm that evening."
