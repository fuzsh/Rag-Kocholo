I have known John for many years in his role as Bishop of Clogher. He is a man of immense wisdom, intellect and deep spirituality.\n\n“I welcome his words of encouragement on working together for the common good, which are so relevant during these difficult times. I look forward to engaging with him and all Church leaders in the time to come.”\n\nThe deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “I offer my warmest wishes to Archbishop John McDowell as he takes up the office of Primate of All-Ireland.\n\n“I was really encouraged by the Archbishop’s recent message where he spoke about reconciliation, saying that ‘reconciliation is always unfinished’. I think this is an important and timely message to us all; and something we should all be mindful of as we seek to build an inclusive and peaceful society for all by working together.”\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nFor media enquiries, contact The Executive Office: press.office@executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk.
