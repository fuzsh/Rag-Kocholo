        "text": "The Bishop of Killaloe ( kil-ə-LOO) is an episcopal title which takes its name after the town of Killaloe in County Clare, Ireland.[1] In the Roman Catholic Church it remains a separate title, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other bishoprics.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Diocese of Killaloe was one of the twenty-four dioceses established at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111. The boundaries of the diocese consisted of almost all of County Clare, the northern part of County Tipperary and the western part of County Offaly. Its Irish name is Cill-da-lua (Church of Lua), so named from St Mo Lua, an abbot who lived in the late 6th century.[2] At the Synod of Kells in March 1152, Killaloe some lost territory when the dioceses of Kilfenora, Roscrea and Scattery Island were created.\n\nFollowing the Reformation, there are now parallel Killaloe dioceses: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn Church of Ireland\n\nThe pre-Reformation Cathedral Church of St Flannan, Killaloe continued as the Church of Ireland bishop's seat (cathedra).[3] The Church of Ireland title was united with Kilfenora in 1752, and again with Clonfert & Kilmacduagh in 1834. Since 1976, it has been part of the united bishopric of Limerick and Killaloe.[1]\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church\n\nThe Roman Catholic bishop's seat is located at St Peter and St Paul Cathedral in Ennis, County Clare. The current bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe is the Most Reverend Fintan Monahan who succeeded on 25 September 2016.\n\nPre-Reformation bishops\n\nPre-Reformation Bishops of Killaloe From Until Incumbent Notes unknown 1098 Domnall Ua hÉnna I died 1 December 1098 dates unknown Gilla Pátrick Ua hÉnna unknown 1131 Domnall Ua Conaing [A] translated to Cashel in 1131 c. 1131 c. 1137/38 Domnall Ua Lonngargáin [B] translated to Cashel c. 1137 or 1138 c. 1138 1161 Tadg Ua Lonngargáin died in office c. 1161 1164 Donnchad mac Diarmata Ua Briain died in office bef. 1179 1194 Constantín mac Toirrdelbaig Ua Briain died in office 1194 1195 Diarmait Ua Conaing died in office bef. 1201 1216 Conchobhar Ua h-Énna died in office; also known as Cornelius 1216 unknown Domnall Ua h-Énna II elected 1216; confirmed by Pope Honorius III 1219; consecrated 1221; also known as Donatus 1217 1221/26 Robert Travers elected before 14 January 1217; consecrated after 14 January 1217; deprived 1221, and again May 1226 1231 1252 Donat O'Kennedy elected before 1231; died before 1252; also known as Donatus 1253 1267 Ísóc Ó Cormacáin elected before 5 April 1253; appointed and consecration 23 June 1253; resigned before 10 November 1267; also known as Isaac 1268 1281 Mathgamain Ó h-Ócáin elected before 20 March 1268; died 12 August 1281; also known as Matthaeus 1281 1298 Mauricius Ó h-Ócáin elected 23 November 1281; died before October 1298 1299 1317 David Mac Mathghamna elected 7 January 1299; consecrated May 1299; died 9 February 1317; also known as David Mac Mahon 1317 1322 Tomás Ó Cormacáin I elected before 2 July 1317; died 31 July 1322 1323 c. 1325 Brian Ó Coscraig elected before 1 August 1323; died c. 1325; also known as Benedictus 1326 1342 David Mac Briain elected before May 1326; appointed 25 May 1326; died 12 December 1342; also known as 'David of Emly' ? 1326 1334 Unatus O Heime possibly elected in 1326; died 1334; also may known as Uaithne Ó hÉnna unknown 1354 Tomás Ó h-Ógáin died 30 October 1354 1355 1382 Tomás Ó Cormacáin II elected before May 1355; appointed 27 May 1355; died 1382 1389 1400 Mathghamhain Mág Raith appointed before August 1398; died before February 1400; also known as Matthaeus 1400 1421 Donatus Mág Raith, O.S.A. appointed before 8 February 1400; consecrated before 9 April 1400; died after August 1421 1409 Robert Mulfield, O.Cist. appointed 9 September 1409, but did not get possession; acted as a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Lichfield c. 1418 to 1440 1418 1431 Eugenius Ó Faoláin translated from Kilmacduagh; resident in a portion of the diocese; died before 24 July 1431 1423 1443 Thaddaeus Mág Raith I appointed 25 October 1423; consecrated after 5 November 1423; died before July 1443 1429 1443 Séamus Ó Lonnghargáin translated from Annaghdown 9 December 1429; consecrated c.
