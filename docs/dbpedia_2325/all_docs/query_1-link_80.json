        "text": "This article examines the origins and implications of the Irish Toleration Act of 1719. It makes three related arguments. Firstly, it highlights what Britons during the early eighteenth-century thought religious toleration was meant to achieve and to whom and under what circumstances religious toleration might be extended. Secondly, it demonstrates the steady desacralization of post-revolutionary British politics, even in a country like Ireland so obviously riven along confessional lines. Finally, it contends that both the arguments for and against the Irish Toleration Act illustrate that the established churches in the composite post-revolutionary British state were functionally civil religions.\n\nWhile for us the central question of republicanism is whether a country has a king or not, in the eighteenth century a republic or “commonwealth” was about whose wishes government reflected and whose benefit was paramount. While originally associated with Cromwell's Commonwealth, the period after 1690 saw republican ideas being reintroduced and rehabilitated. This paper explores that project through three Irishmen involved Robert Molesworth (1656-1725), John Toland (1670-1722) and Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746). Talk given at What is a Republic conference, held at Maynooth University on 23rd May 2016 (with footnotes and images added)."
