Unlike the period from 1793 until 1815, external factors had little influence on the campaign. The great disturbing factor, the sudden succession of four prime ministers came in the final two years.\n\nThe famous Catholic Association was short-lived, lasting but two years. Those involved in the agitation kept together and maintained their unity after its suppression. Those who favoured emancipation, seeing that many Catholics strongly objected to a veto suggested that instead the Government should be given two other securities, the payment of the clergy and the raising the qualification for voting in parliamentary elections.\n\nAgitation continued with ever-greater intensity, and various tactics were invented to circumvent the suppression of the Catholic Association. Agitation against Emancipation also developed strongly.\n\nThe Catholic Association (April 1823 to June 1825)\n\nThis association had a comparatively short life, but the spirit that inspired the movement could not be suppressed, and those involved carried on the campaign through various expedients.\n\nEarly in 1823 a meeting was held in Glencullen in Co. Wicklow at the house of a gentleman named OMara who was a friend of both OConnell and Sheil to explore if there were grounds on which they could co-operate. This did not mean that they had to like or trust each other, but to see if there was any formula of words that could bridge the now quite narrow gap between the vetoists and anti-vetoists. However desirable to some of an Emancipation Act entirely without securities, it seemed obvious to most people that a Bill without some nod in the direction of royal control would never be adopted by their parliamentary representatives, and would never pass the Commons, let alone the Lords. On the other hand, OConnell had come to recognise that the securities were so watered down as to be no more than a recognition of existing practice. It was totally pointless striving for an Act without official securities when the first thing the Pope would do in practice regarding an appointment was to consult the British Government. The main problem for OConnell was to bring his followers around to this position. The re-establishment of the Catholic Board does not seem to have been an issue. What was necessary was co-operation before and during Aggregate Meetings. But under the restless OConnell it became more than that.\n\n[April 1823] According to Purcell OGorman the first meeting of the Catholic Association was held on the 24 March 1823 (DEP 28 Feb 1824). This appears to have been a private meeting, for no details were released to the press. OGorman may have been referring to the meeting between Shiel and OConnell. Before it could be properly organised, a leading Whig politician and promoter of Parliamentary Reform, Sir Francis Burdett, decided for his own reasons to bring matters to a head. On the 17 April 1823, when several petitions were being presented Sir Francis rose to express his most unqualified disapproval of the annual farce. His point seems to have been that the Emancipation Bill could only be passed if the cabinet were united behind it, and if pro-Catholic ministers like Canning all tendered their resignations Lord Liverpool would be forced to resign and it would be possible to construct such a united pro-Catholic cabinet. Canning in reply denied that he had said that the question was hopeless as Burdett had averred. Brougham accused Canning of truckling with the Lord Chancellor, Eldon, to get the whole inheritance. Canning blurted out That is false and was forced by the Speaker to withdraw the remark. There is no doubt that Cannings acceptance of the Foreign Office annoyed the Whigs. Milner wrote to Rome to complain about Plunkets proposed securities, but Rome refused to get involved. The Opposition proposed that the debate should be adjourned for six months, i.e. until after this session, was defeated, but a motion that House adjourn was passed. Technically it was a victory for Plunket, but the question was not raised for another two years. What seems to have sparked off the row was a simple remark of Canning that it was still not possible to form a ministry other than on the open principle. But on getting the Foreign Office Canning had less to do with Catholic affairs prompting suspicion that he had done a deal to get office (SNL 21 April 1823, DEP 22 April 1823, Ward III).\n\nThe first real meeting (what the Post called a preliminary meeting) of the Catholic Association took place on 25 April 1823 with Lord Killeen, Fingalls eldest son in the chair. Fingall retired into private life, and henceforth his son took his place. (There is a deed in the Fingall Papers dated 24 Jan 1822 by which the earl, in return for an annuity, handed over his estate to his son who undertook to pay his fathers debts.) Both sides were represented. It was proposed to hold an Aggregate Meeting, and OConnell proposed reviving the Catholic Board on the grounds that the Orangemen were organised. (The Orange Order was still in existence, but largely inactive, and those who were loosely called Orangemen in Dublin, despite suspicions, do not seem to have taken any steps to co-ordinate their activities. Joseph Hume, the Whig leader, was particularly suspicious of them and strongly suspected the Orange magistrates of protecting members of the Order.) The date for the Aggregate Meeting was fixed for the 10 May. The gentlemen met again on 30 April under Sir Edward Bellew to prepare the resolutions for the Aggregate Meeting. OConnell said,\n\nHe thought it the duty of the Aggregate Meeting to pass, on behalf of Mr Plunket, a resolution declaratory of gratitude and confidence, and couched in as ardent an unqualified terms as the language could afford (loud applause). He looked upon Mr Plunket as a perfect martyr to his public duty. He was now actually standing the brunt of a persecution more audacious, persevering, and malignant than any other being, even in this country of persecution, had ever before to encounter (DEP 3 May 1823).\n\nStripped of its hyperbolic rhetoric, the speech meant that OConnell was prepared to back Plunkets Bill with its innocuous securities. Presumably this was the substance of the agreement with Sheil. OConnell stuck to his bargain. The reference to the persecution of Plunket apparently is to an attempt by the Ascendancy faction to get Plunket dismissed. Resolutions to address the king and to support Plunket were agreed. Not all were anxious to see the Association or Board revived, but OConnell pressed hard for it.\n\n[May 1823] The Aggregate Meeting was held on Saturday 10 May 1823 in Townsend Street chapel, with Lord Killeen in the chair. It was resolved to address the king, and motions of confidence in Plunket and Donoughmore were passed. It was proposed by Nicholas Mahon and Sheil to form an Association, and it was agreed at OConnells insistence to meet to form such the following Monday 12 May. Aggregate Meetings still continued as they always had been, public meetings open to all who chose to attend, Catholic or Protestant, whether belonging to the Association or not. From their nature large public meetings are not useful for discussing matters in detail and so were normally called to assent to a resolution or petition already agreed in private. Those proposing the resolution could therefore claim wider public support.\n\nOn the following day, Sunday 11 May 1823, Archbishop Troy died at his home in Rutland Square, Dublin, aged 84. He had been a bishop for 47 years and archbishop for 39 Years. He was born in 1739, and became archbishop of Dublin in 1784 having previously been bishop of Ossory since 1776. His co-adjutor, Archbishop Murray, automatically succeeded as archbishop of Dublin. He had only to apply to Rome for the pallium of an archbishop.\n\nOn Monday 12 May 1823 the gentlemen met in Dempseys tavern in Sackville Street with Lord Killeen in the chair. It was agreed that the name should be the Catholic Association, that it should consist of such members who annually subscribe one guinea (about fifty pounds nowadays), and that Nicholas Mahon should act as treasurer. Purcell OGorman, already confirmed as Catholic Secretary, acted as secretary to the Association. Forty five gentlemen subscribed before leaving the room (SNL 13 May 1823).Reynolds noted that the original membership consisted of one viscount, the younger son of a baron, two baronets, a knight, a Carmelite friar, nineteen barristers, twelve attorneys, three editors of newspapers, one surgeon, eleven merchants, and ten landed gentlemen. That it was intended that the Association should be an exclusive one of gentlemen is clear from the annual subscription. The Association had the drawback that it was largely a Dublin one, and so could not claim to be a representative one. No doubt many of its members saw this as an advantage, for it was clearly outside the scope of the Convention Act.\n\nOn 13 May a committee consisting of Sir Edward Bellew, OConnell, Sheil, E. MacDonnell, N. Mahon, H. OConnor, Ronan, Hayes, Scanlan, Lonergan and Calanan was appointed to draw up rules. Goulburn reported to Peel,\n\nAlthough Lord Fingall, Sir Edward Bellew and others stated privately their disapprobation of the Association, they did not conceal that they dared not set themselves against it (Reynolds).\n\nDistrust might be a better word than disapprobation. Another reason for objecting to a Catholic Association, shared by the Marquis Wellesley, was that if the Catholics organised themselves into an association the more extreme Protestants would do the same. And so it proved. Wellesley wished to suppress it but Parliament would not vote the necessary powers (Brynn). Whether Emancipation would have come sooner without OConnell and the Association is a point that will never be settled. No doubt it would have come eventually, and without the divisiveness caused by OConnells Association. During the first year of its existence there was little enthusiasm for it. On more than one occasion it lacked a quorum. On one famous occasion OConnell persuaded two students from Maynooth who were buying books to stand in for a few moments, as all clergymen were ipso facto members, to get a resolution passed. As the others feared, OConnell used it as a vehicle to pursue objectives other than petitioning Parliament for Emancipation. One of his first points was to attack the Dublin Grand Jury for appointing a Catholic chaplain to Newgate gaol not approved by the Catholic archbishop. OConnell itched to attack those he considered Orangemen on every possible pretext while the others did not. On this particular occasion he had to be told by Nicholas Mahon that the Catholic Association was not yet in existence (DEP 23 May 1823).\n\nIn May 1823 Lord Nugent with the support of Peel introduced Bills to give to English Catholics the same rights as Irish Catholics. Both passed the Commons but were lost in the Lords. Peel noted that English Catholics could not vote, could not become magistrates, and were excluded from more offices than Irish Catholics. The reason for this was that the Irish Catholic Relief Act (1793) went further than the earlier English Relief Act. But a Bill was eventually passed to allow anyone to take a post connected with the Revenue with only the obligation to take the oath of allegiance. Another Bill was also passed to allow the Duke of Norfolk, now a Catholic, to exercise his functions as Earl Marshal of England (Ward III). The Unlawful Oaths Act (1823) was passed against secret societies. It had the effect of forcing the Loyal Orange Order to drop their oath. Though this Act was directed against secret oath-bound societies, whether agrarian terrorists or violent trade unions, the effect on the Orange Order was just to place it on the same legal footing as the Catholic Association. The Orange Order met on the 4 August 1823 and dropped all oaths and secrets except the password (SNL 2 Dec 1823). Earlier in the year, in the course of a debate, Peel said he never had any contact with any Orange lodge, not even to receive an address. This did not save him from being called Orange Peel by OConnell.\n\n[June 1823] The English Catholic Association was now formed on the same principles as the Irish one on 2 June 1823 (Ward III). The English Association made Catholic priests ipso facto members of the Association, and OConnell quickly copied this on 14 June. Sheil proposed that they should not have a vote but was over-ruled. Sheil also with some foresight proposed that the Association be called the National Association, implying that Protestants should be admitted equally, and that it was unwise to depict the campaign as one of Catholics against Protestants, but his suggestion was not adopted. An early proposal that Protestant members should not have the vote was not adopted either. The aim of the English Association was to involve the clergy in any action from the very start, and so to prevent unseemly rows like those between Milner and Butler. Milner failed to get Rome to condemn Butler, so he decided in his own diocese to treat him as a rebel to ecclesiastical authority and a public sinner (ibid.). In Ireland the effect was to draw the Catholic clergy into secular politics, and there they remained for the next hundred years. The bulk of the rural clergy came from those groups who backed OConnell most fervently, and these priests were to become his most devoted and uncritical lieutenants. It was never OConnells intention to exclude Protestants, but he certainly believed in an Ireland with a certain Catholic ascendancy with the highest offices in the state going automatically to Catholics. This was a view which most Irish Catholic priests could support. OConnell emphatically did not believe in a secular state. (Indeed his views of the relationship of the Irish State to the Pope were curiously like those of Henry VIII.)\n\nThe earliest meetings of the Catholic Association were devoted to combating the Orangemen. There can be little doubt that this was what OConnell had in mind when he so enthusiastically promoted the New Association. Mr OConnor of Mountjoy Square said the chief problem was not with Peel, who was straightforward in his opposition, nor with the judges, but with the Grand Juries (DEP 13 May 1823). At one meeting Sheil proposed to return to an old medieval custom in Ireland where juries were selected de medietate linguae, six Irish-speakers and six English-speakers, but now with six Catholics and six Protestants on each jury. Purcell OGorman said that every Catholic gentleman entitled to bear arms should get a sword and defend himself, another inappropriate piece of medievalism. In explanation he said that every Catholic gentleman had a right to defend his family if attacked by Orangemen. But the fat was in the fire. Goulburn was suspicious of the Association from the start, but now Plunket the attorney general would have to take notice. The fatal shadow of Wolfe Tone still lay over the Catholics regardless of the fact that he was a Protestant.\n\nOnly Eneas MacDonnell maintained that the main issue was being lost sight of, the need to petition Parliament for Emancipation, and he objected to petitions against Orangemen. Sir John Burke said he favoured continuing to petition, but admitted that OConnell was against him. He added that he was glad OConnell was not present for he feared the lash of that gentlemans superior talent (DEP 12 June 1823). Burdetts intervention seems to have revived OConnells desire not to seek Emancipation from an unreformed Parliament. Purcell OGorman, the following February, reported that the Association in its first eleven months had held 34 regular weekly meetings, and 10 meetings of committees. In view of the number of times it was inquorate, we can suppose that few members attended regularly.\n\nIn June 1823 the Association drew up a petition to be presented by Henry Brougham protesting against the evils of the Orange administration. This, whether or not it was intended, included Wellesley and Plunket. In the ensuing debate the Whigs, faced by Peel who had an encyclopaedic knowledge of Ireland, found themselves long on grievance and rhetoric but short of actual facts. They requested that in future they should be supplied with the facts. The Association undertook to find the facts, at least such facts as favoured their cause. The grievances were still the same as in 1794, that Catholics were excluded from trade guilds and corporations of towns, from Grand Juries, and the magistracy to which they were legally entitled to belong. Yet the Catholics themselves from 1805 onwards had made admission to Parliament their principal object. OConnell was preparing petitions on twelve different subjects when Parliament rose on 22 July 1823.\n\n[September 1823] Pius VII died after being Pope for 24 years. There were only two Popes since Pius VII became Pope in 1775, and there were only two Popes between 1831 and 1878. But there were two short-lived Popes between 1823 and 1831 Leo XII 1823 to 1829 and Pius VIII 1829-30.Consalvi ceased to be Secretary of State, being replaced by Cardinal Somaglia. Consalvi was made Prefect of Propaganda but died a few weeks later. Consalvis aim in life was to adapt the Church to the modern political scene. Cardinal Somaglia was expected to be elected, but the obscure and reactionary Cardinal della Genga was elected. The British Government was glad that none of the cardinals being promoted by the various Catholic powers was elected (SNL 11 Nov 1823). The new Pope was elected to reverse such advances towards liberalism as his predecessor had allowed. But papal policy regarding Ireland remained unchanged. Also, as no matter was referred to Rome by any party during these brief pontificates, there were no repercussions in Ireland A funeral service for the late Pope was held in the Catholic chapel of Moorfields just outside the old walls of London. There was a large crowd of foreign ambassadors, eminent Catholic clergy, and Catholic and Protestant gentlemen. No Catholic church had survived in the traditional square mile of the city of London, but a chapel had been built in the fields just outside the walls in 1710. The northern fields were called the moor fields. The chapel in Lincoln Inns Field was built in 1687. That in Warwick Street in Soho, the Bavarian chapel attached to the Bavarian embassy dated from 1730. Mass was always said in the chapels attached to the Spanish, Portuguese, and French embassies.\n\nIn Dublin, Archbishop Magee was again at the centre of a row, when the sexton on his orders forbade a Catholic priest, the redoubtable Dr Michael Blake, to say prayers at a Catholic funeral in a Protestant cemetery. The Catholic Association involved itself in this affair also. The row proved to have been based on a misunderstanding. The archbishop, correctly in canon law, had stated that no clergyman was to conduct any rite in any Church property, unless that rite and that clergyman was approved by the bishop. This was just part of the general tightening up of discipline in the Church of Ireland. A local vicar would no longer be able to invite a passing clergyman of note to preach. The Catholic priest in question was aware of this and was merely leading the mourners in private prayer, which was not forbidden. A law was then passed allowing Catholics to establish their own cemeteries, but many of them for nearly a hundred years more insisted on using the family plot in the traditional cemetery.\n\nThe Catholic Association continued to meet but was often inquorate.\n\n[January 1824] Lord Lansdowne became leader of the Whig Party. This party which had drifted in a rather rudderless fashion under ineffective leaders for twenty years after the death of Fox began to pull itself together. The effect was to be seen some years later when Lord Liverpool died and Lansdowne found it possible to bring his group of supporters to back Canning. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, Lord Lansdowne, was Irish by parentage and title but lived in England for his entire life.\n\nAs the Catholic Association appeared to be dying OConnell proposed the collection of a Catholic Rent from every parish in Ireland to generate adequate funds, and also to give every parish in Ireland a direct interest in the struggle. A committee was formed to see if this plan could be put into execution. OConnell busied himself with drawing up petitions with regard to various topics like tithes and vestry cesses.\n\n[February 1824] It seems to have been at a mid-week meeting of the Association in mid-February when the Association was meeting in a room over Coynes bookshop that OConnell made up the quorum by persuading two students looking at books in the bookshop to make it up. His scheme for the Rent was now complete. If one million Catholics paid a farthing a week or a penny a month or a shilling a year, the annual sum raised would be £50,000. (Four farthings equal one penny; twelve pennies equal one shilling. The farthing was the smallest coin, but by adopting it even sums could be paid for the month and the year.) This calculation was to mesmerise the Catholic Ultras for many years, and OConnell maintained the collection of the Rent until the day he died. In practice the problem was how to sustain public interest. In times of great excitement the Rent soared, but then fell rapidly away. To arouse public interest OConnell set out the following objectives to be achieved by means of the Rent. Petitions could be presented from every parish on all sorts of subjects. A London agent could be maintained to transact their business with Parliament. The liberal press could be supported by buying advertising space in liberal papers in Dublin and London. Money could be set aside to pay the fees for Catholics being tried by Orange magistrates. Then £5,000 could be set aside for Catholic education, £5,000 to educate priests to go to America, and £5,000 for building schools and chapels. (To get the modern equivalent multiply the sums by about forty.) He said if the nabob of Arcot could maintain members in Parliament so too could the Catholics. He was not saying that seats could be bought, but if they had money they could be represented (SNL 5 Feb 1824).(OConnell was the first president of a Catholic Orphan Society formed by Dr Michael Blake which was supported largely by penny-a-week subscriptions, Ronan)\n\nOrganisationally, by basing the collection on the Catholic parishes it would be comparatively easy to get from the various bishops the names of the parish priests in their respective dioceses, and the post towns from which they collected their mail (SNL 10 May 1824). At this period everyone collected and paid for their letters in the post offices in the post towns. The Catholic priests would also recommend honest and trustworthy men to act as local collectors in their parishes.\n\nParliament opened on 3 February 1824. On 18 February, at a meeting of the Catholic Association, Mr Frederick Conway was asked to take the chair. The level of attendance had not improved, but there was much activity among those who did attend. OConnell defended the use of abusive language like haughty and erratic neighbours when referring to the English.\n\nWas it not notorious that the Catholic cause never presented so dreary and unpromising an aspect  an appearance so destitute of hope? This should be met by some corresponding, some powerful excitement; something which would show that every vein through which circulates the lifeblood of Irishmen throbs with anxiety for the removal of Catholic disabilities (hear, hear) and the attainment of Emancipation (SNL 19 Feb 1824).\n\nAn Aggregate Meeting was held in Townsend Street chapel on 27 February 1824 with Sir Thomas Esmonde in the chair. In a speech, one of those present, Stephen Coppinger referred to Napoleon that bravest and greatest of the sons of men. Loud and deafening shouts of applause which lasted a considerable time followed the mention of this name. As members of the police as well as reporters from the press attended these meetings this outburst would have been speedily reported to the Government. This was apparently before OConnell and Sheil arrived. OConnell, in his speech referred pointedly to the part his family played in the struggle against Napoleon, and how his relative and friend of his youth was killed at the siege of San Sebastien fighting under Wellington. Sixteen resolutions were proposed and adopted (SNL 28 Feb, 2 Mar, DEP 28 Feb 1824).\n\n[March 1824] Various county meetings were held in different parts of the country as the barristers from Dublin attended the assizes. Plunket as a Member of Parliament refused to recognise the Association and communicated with OConnell as with a single gentleman. Only corporations with charters could petition as bodies (SNL 21 February 1825). It was claimed that the first petition from any body which was distinct from a group of parliamentary electors came from the Dublin Trades Union in the time of Earl Greys ministry 1830-32 (Speech of Marcus Costello, SNL 17 February 1832). Donoughmore had no objection to receiving petitions from the Catholic Association. However the words Catholic Association were not mentioned in the petition. Grey and Brougham advised the Catholics to omit from their petition any reference to the Established Church, or the need to exclude Orangemen from the magistracy or from juries, for such references would only injure their cause. Herein lay the difficulty of trying to get seats in Parliament, and to remedy lesser abuses at the same time. To get biased Orangemen removed from the bench or from juries, or to attack the iniquity of tithes and church cesses, one had to be specific in ones charge as the Whigs had pointed out. But pointing them out risked alienating those Protestants whose support in Parliament was essential. There was the other problem with OConnells approach and that was that if he and others were to rouse the masses to enthusiasm in support of the cause it was necessary to use high-flown and abusive rhetoric. Sir Thomas Wyse later commented that it became necessary to hold separate meetings of Catholics and Protestants (Wyse). Later still, the nationalists of Young Ireland deplored the division of Ireland into Catholic and Protestant. But that was the way OConnell was. Conway noted that the Orangemen had never been so numerous or so well organised. Whatever OConnell did the Orangemen always strove to surpass him. As the Protestants in most parts of Ireland were a richer and more cohesive group feeling themselves under attack they always succeeded in rivalling and surpassing OConnells activities. But all his life OConnell preferred rabble-rousing and Orange-bashing to working with the moderate Protestants. His language had been noticed by the king also, who in November wrote to Peel saying he was considering acting like his father and not allowing the open principle in the cabinet. In other words, as under Spencer Perceval, only those who opposed Emancipation would be allowed into the cabinet (Ward III). According to Luby, after Emancipation was finally gained, Stephen Coppinger told OConnell, half in jest and half in earnest, that notwithstanding OConnells efforts to the contrary, they had finally got Emancipation.\n\nThe Irish Catholic bishops were at this time petitioning for a better way of educating Irish children other than by giving money to a Protestant Society, which many Catholics feared was of a proselytising character. Hence the bait in the scheme for the Catholic Rent to allocate some of it to Catholic schools. Much activity of the Association at this time was taken up with refuting a remark of an MP named North that the Catholic clergy neglected education, and that the education of Catholic schoolchildren was largely left to hedgeschools where the Life of Feeney the Robber and Moll Flanders were used as textbooks. The charge was not without substance, as the Catholic bishops were aware, but they also knew that without Government help they could not maintain any schools, let alone Catholic schools in rural areas (Keenan II). Much effort too was strangely put into opposing Plunkets Bill for cemeteries not under the control of the clergy of any Church. Apparently the point was that if a Catholic parish provided itself with a new cemetery a Dissenting clergyman could claim the right to officiate in it. But the Government did not want to have a multitude of cemeteries in each parish, one for every denomination.\n\n[May 1824] Frederick Conway acted as secretary to various Catholic meetings in the absence of OGorman.\n\n[June 1824] OConnell refused to abate the language of the Address, so Grey, when presenting it said there was much in it he did not agree with. Plunket too, in presenting the petition in the Commons expressed reservation (SNL 3 June 1824). It had been decided in Parliament not to move on the petition that year, and as Grey pointed out, the Catholics would have plenty of time to remove the more objectionable phrases. Parliament rose early that year on 25 June.\n\nAbout this time, OConnell proposed in the Accounts Committee of the Catholic Association that an efficient secretary should be appointed and paid £160 a year to relieve Purcell OGorman of routine business. One member called Kirwin asked at a meeting of the Association why an efficient secretary was required at £160 a year when a suitable clerk could be found for half that money. He referred to the old debts and moved that they be paid, including the considerable sum due to Edward Hay. His motion was not seconded. Dwyer was however elected by the Association. The fact was that OConnell wanted to employ Dwyer a friend of his whom had to be persuaded to return from Liverpool in England. OConnell said that the debts arose under the Catholic Board, so money from the Catholic Association could not be used to pay them off. To which Kirwin replied that they were behaving like litigants, not honourable men (DEP 22, 29 June 1824). Conway in the Post considered that the old debts should be paid, and shortly afterwards resigned from the office of pro-secretary, but declined to give reasons.\n\n[July 1824] The Association, having met regularly for 10 months adjourned until October. The Rent was beginning to come in, and it was no longer a sickly child. Several of the aristocratic party had written to Dr Curtis warning him not to get too involved with OConnell as anything he did would be viewed with suspicion by the Government. He supported OConnell in this matter but wished to preserve peace with the aristocratic faction (Curtis to Dr. Plunket 21 May 1824, Cogan). Later in the year, with regard to a proposed mission of OConnell, Sheil, and Woulfe to London, Curtis wrote to Poynter saying that OConnell was the only one of the three he was acquainted with and he had no hesitation in pronouncing him one of the most sincere and most practical Catholics I ever knew (Ward III). The Finance Committee of the Catholic Association, often with Frederick Conway in the chair, continued to meet weekly.\n\n[October 1824] Dr Plunkett of Meath, one of the bishops involved in the veto controversy in 1799 recommended to his clergy to collect the Rent. The Dublin Evening Post noted that the Association now had about 1,000 members and an income of about £1,000 a month. Dr Curtis and Dr Doyle expressed their approbation. Archbishop Murray and Dr MacMahon the co-adjutor of Killaloe joined. Lord Gormanston, Lord Netterville, and the Earl of Kenmare and his brothers either joined or expressed support. The third series of full meetings of the Catholic Association commenced on 16 October after the summer break, and meetings were by now quite crowded. It was proposed to have a new petition ready for the first day of the Parliamentary session.\n\nThe Association moved its regular place of meeting to rooms in the Corn Exchange which were larger. They leased the upper floor of the Exchange from the Corn Exchange Committee. (The Corn Exchange was built to allow corn merchants to buy and sell corn for export on the basis of samples. This avoided the need to pay the toll to bring the goods into Dublin and to bring them out again.) Here it was protected from attacks by students from Trinity College, for there were many Catholic coal porters nearby on the quays, who could be summoned if any attack were made. The Association had first met in rooms in Capel Street, and then moved to Homes Hotel where students from Trinity College were liable to interrupt. On 27 October 1824 the students tried to raid the new premises but were driven off by the coal porters. (Some Protestants considered these porters excessively officious and inclined to get rough with any strangers who approached OConnell.)\n\n[November 1824] The first meeting in the Corn Exchange was held on 15 November 1824. On 3 November 1824 Wellington wrote to Peel to say that if they could not get rid of the Catholic Association civil war in Ireland was inevitable (Ward III).\n\n[December 1824] A Parliamentary Agent living in London was appointed. The person chosen was Eneas MacDonnell, whose chief interest now was in opposing proselytisers. Luby states that he was appointed because he was not on friendly terms with OConnell. The great series of theological debates between the Catholics and the so-called biblicals, those who belonged to Protestant Bible Societies spread over Ireland and proved very popular. The bishops at first gave their consent, but finding that they were generating more heat than light tried to stop them. This proved easier said than done for the sport was very popular. Some Catholics then took to attending Protestant religious meetings and reading out speeches of Sheil and other Catholics.\n\nAn Aggregate Meeting was held in Clarendon Street chapel on 2 December 1824 with Sir Thomas Esmonde in the chair. OGorman reported that the membership was now 3,000. It was resolved to petition Parliament. It was also decided to send a mission consisting of OConnell, Sheil, and Woulfe to England, with Mr Bric as secretary. In the event they did not go. It was decided to entrust their petition to Sir Francis Burdett. The attorney general, Plunket, endeavoured to get OConnell tried for seditious speech but the Grand Jury did not find a true bill. His own rhetoric carried OConnell away when speaking of his own hero Bolivar. He never in his life advocated the use of arms, but had he ever done so an armed mob would have instantly rushed to his side. Later his own supporters in Young Ireland would deplore the way he spoke as if he intended leading an army but always backed down.\n\n[February 1825] Though the Catholic Association was flourishing, the Government was considering how to suppress both it, the Orange Order and the Ribbon Societies. Some of the supporters of the Catholics in Parliament considered that their Bill would have a better chance of success if the Catholic Association were dissolved. Parliament opened on 3 February 1825 and in the Kings Speech, reference was made to dangerous associations in Ireland and left it Parliament to devise ways of dealing with them. The associations were those which have adopted proceedings irreconcilable with the spirit of the Constitution, and calculated, by exciting alarm, and by exasperating animosities to endanger the peace of society (DEP 8 Feb 1825). (These were certainly things OConnell excelled at, and are the reason why most of the associations he founded were suppressed.) The cabinet had of course already decided what it was going to do, and Goulburn gave notice of a Suppression Bill. Wellesley sent to the cabinet proposals for a Catholic Relief Bill to accompany the suppression of the Association but this was rejected by the Cabinet (SNL 2 March 1829). Plunket also envisioned the Suppression Bill as an adjunct to the Relief Bill, and in this spirit he supported Goulburns Suppression Bill.\n\nThe members of the Catholic Association were well aware of their danger, and Lord Killeen took the chair on the 9 February before the greatest gathering yet of the Association. The next meeting took place on 10 February, with Lord Gormanston in chair. It was resolved to send a large deputation to London. It was decided to call an Aggregate Meeting and it met on 15 February 1825 in Townsend Street chapel with Lord Killeen in the chair. Killeen advised caution but Jack Lawless, standing on the altar called on the meeting to return blow for blow. Living as he did in Belfast Lawless prided himself on knowing the mind of ordinary Protestants, but as later events were to show he had no more idea of the mentality of most Ulster Protestants than OConnell himself who never went to the North. On the same day OConnell, Sheil, Lord Killeen, the Hon. Mr Preston (of the Gormanston family) and other Catholic gentlemen sailed for England.\n\nThe problem facing the Government was how to frame a law which respected freedom of speech and freedom of the press, freedom of association, freedom to criticise the Government which was the pride of the British Constitution, without allowing Ireland to degenerate into two armed hostile camps. Robust criticism of the crown and the Government was permitted and widespread, and mobs could express their opinions by breaking the windows of unpopular politicians. Wellington was to have his windows broken over Emancipation. But there was no danger in England that two sides would arm themselves to fight a civil war. (Whether orators could rouse up the people of Ireland to take up arms to a sufficient extent to cause a civil war was never put to the test.)\n\nGoulburn introduced the Unlawful Societies (Irish) Suppression Act (1825) in the Commons on 10 February which was intended to, among other things, emend the Convention Act (1793). He claimed that the Catholic Association was virtually a representative body, and shielded from the law only by the ingenuity of its promoters. It could not be denied that OConnell was seeking to represent every Catholic parish in Ireland, and to collect a voluntary tax from them, which could be used to attempt the redress of grievances, and he did not confine his activities to petitioning Parliament for redress (SNL 14 February 1825). Plunket supported the Bill, saying it was not aimed solely at the Catholic Association, and the cause of Catholic Emancipation would not be harmed by its suppression. He felt that the system of collecting the rent, though not illegal, was unconstitutional.\n\nIn the Lords on the same day, Lord Liverpool moved for the setting up of a select committee to enquire into the state of Ireland. A similar committee was set up in the Commons. Primate Curtis, Archbishop Murray, Dr Doyle, Lord Killeen, OConnell, Sheil, and Anthony Blake were among those called to give evidence on the state of Ireland before each of the Houses. The English Catholic Association and the leading Whigs made the Irish delegates welcome. Poynter organised a welcome for the Irish Catholic ecclesiastics summoned to London for the Enquiry Committees.\n\n[March 1825] On 1 March 1825, Burdett moved for a committee of the whole House to examine the Catholic claims. He was supported by Canning, Plunket and Brougham amongst others. The motion was passed by a majority of thirteen. A committee of Parliament was appointed to draw up the Bill and included those just mentioned. OConnell wrote (7 March) that he was permitted to draw up the rough draft of the Bill, which would contain no securities. The Government would pay the clergy, and the threshold for the franchise would be raised from forty shillings to ten pounds. These additions came to be known as the wings for they would help the Bill to fly. OConnell made no objection. In fact OConnell believed that the Ten Pound freeholders were likely to be more independent of their landlords and less likely to vote as directed by them than the Forty Shilling freeholders. Not everyone shared OConnells belief, and considered that the proportion of Protestants with the franchise would rise with respect to the number of Catholics. Conway of the Post agreed with raising the franchise but considered £5 sufficient.\n\nThe Unlawful Societies (Irish) Suppression Act (1825) always referred to as the Algerine Act received the royal assent on 9 March 1825 to come into force on Saturday 20 March. On the nickname see Keenan III.) It was to last two years, and then until the end of the next session of Parliament (SNL 12 July 1827).\n\nOConnells letter was read out at the next meeting of the Catholic Association on 9 March, though it surprised many, produced no particular reaction. At a meeting on Wednesday 16 March with Major George Bryan of Jenkinstown in the chair, Sheil who had returned from London, gave an account of events there. They first went to Burdett who warmly welcomed them, and he recommended Plunket as the proper sponsor of the Bill. The delegates said they had no discretion in this matter but allowed Burdett to use his own. They then went to the House of Common where the question was heard whether counsel should be heard at the bar of the House with regard to the Suppression Bill. Sheil praised Plunket for his advocacy on this point. Next they went to meet the Duke of Norfolk and were warmly welcomed, and any former suspicions they had of the English Catholics evaporated. Next they had a meeting with their parliamentary representatives on the best manner to proceed. These latter wished to defer the Relief Bill until after Easter so that it should not seem to be connected with the Governments Suppression Bill, but OConnell was for immediate action. Regarding the wings Sheil was of the opinion that if they are absolutely necessary they should be conceded, especially as the other side had given up the veto. With regard to payment of the clergy, he had told Peel at the Select Committee, that Emancipation should precede State Provision, that the Government should have no part in the appointment of the clergy, and that the money should be paid out of taxes, not as a Government grant. (The point seems to have been that it would be an ordinary law of the land, not a special Government favour.) He and others said it was better to leave matters until the last meeting of the Association that would be on Friday 18 March.\n\nAt this point Jack Lawless entered the fray, claiming, despite what OConnell claimed, the Bill differed little from Plunkets previous Bill. There was still to be a commission to exclude foreigners and to examine the credentials of those elected bishops. But what really annoyed him was the sacrifice of the Forty Shilling freeholders. Here Lawless, the democrat, differed sharply from OConnell. OConnell considered them unreliable because they were often in debt or in arrears with the rent, they could not afford to register themselves, and were registered by their landlords if and when needed, and most landlords expected that those to whom they gave tenancies would vote as directed by them. Lawless on the other hand valued what was at the time a quite wide franchise. In theory, a tenant with a lease of four acres for three lives who could swear that he could sublet an acre at two pounds (forty shillings) an acre and could swear he was a Forty Shilling freeholder. He did not actually have to sub-let the land or receive any rent, or get an independent valuation, but only to swear when registering his vote that he was in a position to do so. In his evidence to the House of Lords OConnell considered that by raising the threshold to £10 much perjury would be avoided. Later, Dr Doyle had to issue stern warnings against perjury directed at those who wished to register as freeholders. (The respective theories of Lawless and OConnell were never tested, for in the 1828 election, it was only at the end of the first day of voting when OConnell was ahead did a landslide in his favour occur. Had he been behind at the end of the first day a landslide for his opponent was highly likely.)\n\nThe person behind the attack on OConnell was William Cobbett, a strongly self-opinionated journalist, whose writings were widely read and admired at the time despite the fact that he was usually out of touch with economic reality. Cobbett claimed that OConnell had been tricked by the Government, and had sold out the Catholics to get advancement in his profession. According to Cobbett, OConnell had arrived in England on 18 February, and saw Cobbett on 20th, who then warned him that the Government would try to trick him. (Cobbett refused to recognise that Lord Liverpool, the Lord Chancellor, and the Home Secretary were opposed to the Bill, which was a private measure). On 27 February OConnell had dined at Mr Broughams with the Duke of Leinster on one side of him, and the kings brother the Duke of Sussex on the other. On 2 March OConnell saw Mr Plunket, and on the following day, visited him again along with Lord Killeen. Following the first visit OConnell had visited Cobbett and spoke highly of Plunket. Cobbett said that this alarmed him for he felt that the blandishments were having their effect. On 5 March Lawless, who had added himself to the delegation, complained to Cobbett about the wings. Cobbett supported Lawless. Further proof of the alleged sell out could be seen in the fact that Sheil was questioned by one of the Select Committees regarding a patent of precedence in the courts to be given to OConnell (Letter of Cobbett to the People of Ireland 19 July 1825 in SNL 27 July 1825). (Plunket later explained that the proposed patent of precedence would merely allow precedence in the courts over barristers junior to him who had been promoted because they were Protestants. It was in recognition of his outstanding legal talents not his political opinions. When cases were called in the courts, those involving kings counsel were called first.) A letter from Lawless on the alleged sell out was printed in Saunders Newsletter on 18 March 1825.\n\nOConnell was caught in the same trap he had set for others. In the eyes of Cobbett and Lawless the evidence was damning. He had sold out to a minister for personal gain. But OConnell claimed that State Provision would have brought annually £600.000 into Ireland and the Government would have gained nothing from their expenditure. Also that the Forty Shilling franchise in actual fact was worthless. Those in the delegation were split on the matter. There was a question of taking away a valued right of the poorer classes (i.e. the status it conferred) for the benefit of a few rich Catholics. Lord Killeen disliked the wings but probably would not have opposed them.\n\nBurdetts Bill did in fact provide for a veto and exequatur, but the commissioners were to be Irish Catholic bishops. Milner opposed this, but all the others regarded the provisions as harmless (Ward III).\n\nThe Catholic Association met for the last time on Friday 18 Mar 1825 with Col. Butler in the chair and Frederick Conway acting as Secretary. A letter from OConnell, unaware of his danger, dated 16 March was read out. He said Lawless was not a delegate and that the delegates had made no contracts with anyone. He regarded State Provision as a natural consequence of Emancipation. There was no intention to alter the franchise where it was held, as in England, in fee simple, a lease forever with no rent. (The was the original meaning freeholders, but in Ireland over the centuries, it had been watered down to mean a tenant subject to rent for an indefinite period like three lives, i.e. until the death of one of three persons named in the lease, regarded as equivalent to a lease of 31 years. A lease of 31 years, being a definite period of time, could not confer the freehold.) It was not retrospective, so existing freeholders could continue to exercise their vote, and thirdly, the value would not exceed £10. (In line with what was said above, this would include all those who could swear that they had an extra five acres they could let at £2 per acre. This would have included most tenants with above eight or ten acres.) The way of computing the forty shilling surplus after all charges on the land was not clarified at the time. Some farmers considered that if, through their own labour, the land produced two pounds a year, it counted (DEP 30 April 1825). OConnell later made plain that his own preference was for universal suffrage, but this was not on offer. The draft of the Freeholder Bill made it clear, that the Irish freehold must consist of lives renewable forever (SNL 27 April 1825)\n\nSome of those present wished to discuss the questions raised by Lawless, but a majority preferred not to mar their last meeting with rows. An Address to the People of Ireland prepared by Conway was adopted and ordered to be printed. Conway said it was left to him to propose the last Resolution. He had been an active member of the Association since the beginning. He proposed that the Association should adjourn sine die, and this was adopted. The funds of the Association were to be placed in the hands of Lord Killeen who would ensure all its debts were paid. In practice, the banker Nicholas Mahon continued with the administration of the money. A vote of confidence in OConnell was passed. Thanks were voted all round. The Association then dispersed. The Orange Order followed suit.\n\nOConnell was still in London, being examined by the select committees. He was examined at length, and his sober and informed replies on all aspects of Irish society gave great satisfaction to all. He was on his best behaviour, and careful not to give offence. Many of the leading Whigs were anxious to meet him, and he was anxious to dispel any fears that he was a wild or erratic person. With regard to State Provision he said he had consulted certain bishops and priests on the matter and they were satisfied. The person who was examined a greatest length by the parliamentary committees regarding the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church in Ireland was Dr. Doyle. Doyles replies are to this day an excellent source of information on the contemporary practice of the Irish Church, and by extension of the American Catholic Church where Irish-born and educated priests were becoming increasingly influential. Burdetts Bill on Emancipation was given its first reading on 23 March 1825. There were to be two other bills, one on the Forty Shilling freeholders and another on State Provision for the clergy, which were to be introduced separately.\n\n[April 1825] Before the Second Reading was introduced, an Aggregate Meeting of the Catholics was called, and met on 14 April 1825 in Clarendon Street chapel, with Viscount Gormanston in the chair. Mr Conway read the requisition for the meeting that was called to address the king, and asked all speakers to keep strictly to the purpose of the meeting. OConnell attended the meeting but did not speak until called for by the crowd. A resolution to address the king was taken and a delegation was chosen.\n\n[May 1825] On 21 April 1825 the Bill passed its Second Reading as expected by 268 votes to 241, and was carried on to the Committee Stage on 6 May. It passed the Third Reading on 10 May and was carried to the Lords. The other two Bills successfully passed the initial stages. There was great indignation when the kings brother, the heir presumptive to the throne, Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany, spoke out strongly against the Catholics. George III had fifteen children, but very few legitimate grandchildren. His eldest son had only one child, who died before him. The succession to the throne then passed in succession to his next brothers who had no legitimate issue between them. The next son, the Duke of Kent was hastily told to marry, and produced the Princess Victoria who became third in succession after the death of her father. The prospect of the Duke of York becoming king was far from pleasing. Predictably the Bill was rejected in the Lords at the Second Reading. It would have been impolite to the Commons to reject it at its First Reading. The other two Bills were not proceeded with. Sir John Coxe Hippisley died on 3 May 1825.\n\n[June 1825] Another Aggregate Meeting was held in Anne Street chapel on 8 June when the delegates had returned from London. Lord Gormanston took the chair. It was estimated that several thousand people packed into the chapel and Gormanston, Sir Edward Bellew, and O'Connell had the greatest difficulty in getting in. It was resolved to petition again for Emancipation. Lawless was hissed until OConnell asked that he be allowed to speak. But his efforts to get amendments to the Freeholders and State Provision Bills got no support. Sir Edward Bellew proposed the establishment of a new Association. Nothing can be read into this as the Resolutions and proposers were agreed in advance. After the meeting, the crowd drew OConnells carriage to his home in Merrion Square. [Top]\n\nAftermath of the Algerine Act (June to December 1825)\n\nCounsellor Bellew gave it as his opinion that no new association could be formed for the following reasons. No meeting could assemble for longer than fourteen days, no delegation could be given even for the purposes of petitioning Parliament, and no money could be collected except to cover the costs of petitioning (DEP 28 June 1825). If OConnell had no reason to found a new association before this he now had one - to prove Bellew wrong. The reason which he had used two years earlier to prove the necessity of a Catholic Association, namely that the Protestants had an Orange Association, was no longer valid, for it too had been suppressed. The Orangemen, in fact, being the better organised, and more woven into the fabric of society, had lost more than he had. All that was required now was to follow the lead of Lord Fingalls party, hold Aggregate Meetings to petition. If necessary these could assemble for up to fourteen days to arrange resolutions and petitions and collect money to pay costs. To try to start a new association would stimulate the Orange faction to organise a better and more effective one. In the event both Catholics and Protestants started ostensibly charitable associations neither of which generated much enthusiasm. In both cases they were probably a waste of time and money. But we suspect the aim for OConnell was primarily to prove Bellew, and later Plunket, wrong.\n\nAs usual with OConnell his motives are rarely clear. In the present instance, merely to accept the Algerine Act and work within its restrictions would have played into the hands of Lord Fingalls faction. There is no indication at this time that he wished to seize social and political leadership from the aristocracy, or that he wished to embrace a new career as a parliamentarian rather than as a judge. But he seems to have been fascinated with the Rent, and with all he personally expected to be able to accomplish with it.\n\nA private meeting was held on Friday 10 June 1825, following a resolution at the Aggregate Meeting to decide how an association could be set up which would not fall under the Act. The new Association met in the Corn Exchange on Wednesday 22 June 1825 and a ballot was held for a committee of 21. Five lists were circulated and balloting continued from 12 oclock to 4 p.m. Purcell OGorman, the Secretary said that 321 had balloted and asked for an adjournment until the morrow to allow him to make the calculation. Mr Sheil secured most votes namely 317, closely followed by Lord Killeen and Sir John Burke with 313, Captain Bryan and Nicholas Mahon with 312, Daniel OConnell with 311 and Sir Thomas Esmonde with 309. In the list of 21 the success of the aristocratic party was noticeable, but then they were always stronger in Dublin. That OConnells popularity was slightly damaged by the wings controversy is shown by the fact that one of his strongest critics Nicholas Mahon was preferred to him. Neither Lawless nor Sir Edward Bellew were elected. OConnell announced that the new Association would be started after the end of the parliamentary session and not before, for two reasons. The first was in case the two Associations would be confused. The other was in case the Government would rush through new legislation to suppress the new one.\n\nThe general legal idea behind the new association was that there were all kinds of associations in existence for legal purposes. In these gentlemen could combine to attain an end, raise funds, have regular meetings, and correspond with similar societies, and even form a national alliance of associations for a similar purpose. These were associations for the promotion of education, agriculture, science, art, recreation, and so on. The exceptions were associations for illegal purposes, or for political purposes. The aim of the latter was to prevent attempts to emulate the Volunteers National Convention of 1782 or the French National Convention of 1792.\n\n[July 1825] Parliament was prorogued on 6 July 1825. On 12 July 1825 a Catholic meeting was held in the rooms in the Corn Exchange the 21 members presented their Report, but there was a difficulty because O'Connell had taken home the draft copy to have a fair copy made out. The committee of 21, having completed its task dissolved and a committee of 31 was chosen to prepare an Aggregate Meeting.\n\nThis was held in Clarendon Street chapel on 13 July with Lord Gormanston in the chair and Purcell OGorman as secretary. The proposals for the new association were set out. It must be open to everybody; there must be no oath; it would have no power of instituting prosecutions in the courts; it would have no secretary or delegate, or correspond with any other society, or in any way contravene 6 George IV (Algerine Act'); nor would it petition Parliament to remedy any grievances. It could promote peace and concord among His Majestys subjects; encourage education; ascertain the population of Ireland and the respective numbers of Catholics and Protestants; help to construct Catholic churches; establish Catholic burial grounds; promote manufactures, agriculture, and commerce; encourage a liberal press; and rebut charges made against Catholics. Every person paying one pound could become a member. Petitions to Parliament would be adopted at one-day Aggregate Meetings that could adjourn daily for up to fourteen days, and would have no connection with the New Catholic Association. The collection of the Rent would continue, but not by the new Association. OConnell personally, as a sole person, would be responsible for its collection and management (SNL 14 July 1825).Sheil made a powerful speech against the Duke of York which gave great offence, not only to the king his elder brother, but to his younger brother, William, Duke of Clarence (William IV) neither of whom ever forgave him (Luby).\n\nIt is not clear what exactly this association was intended for, except perhaps as an act of defiance to the Government, and to allow OConnell to collect and keep the Rent centrally. Probably, it was envisaged that the Dublin newspapers would report the meetings, and so provide valuable publicity. The Catholics later adopted local meetings very successfully, and the Fourteen Day Aggregate meetings to petition Parliament were more to the point and more effective. But there seems to have been no objection to its establishment by any party. Sheil came to the fore at this time and stressed that the Catholics, far from falling into a moody silence, should step up their campaign of agitation (McCullough). Predictably, the disbanded Orange Order set up a similar association to promote the welfare of Orangemen, The Loyal and Benevolent Orange Institution.\n\nThe New Catholic Association met for the first time on 16 July with Mr Redmond in the chair and Mr Bric secretary for the day. It never gained the popularity or esteem of the old Association. Moderate Catholics would have preferred to pursue aims like the promotion of farming or industry through broader based non-sectarian organisations. The clergy of all denominations regarded even secular education like the teaching of arithmetic as falling within their exclusive sphere. While, for Catholic hard-liners, it was a toothless and ineffective body. Still, it continued to meet until the expiration of the Algerine Act when it changed back into the Catholic Association. OConnell noted that the Association could not correspond with another Association, like the English Catholic Association, but could correspond with individual members of that body. A rules committee could be set up to ensure that all their activities remained within the existing law. Frederick Conway was among those chosen for the committee (SNL 18 July).\n\nCobbett disapproved of the new Association and kept up his attack on OConnell, by writing a Letter to the People of Ireland. He alleged that before he came to London he was threatened with prosecution for a criminal and seditious libel. But after he had come to London he sought out Plunket in the House of Commons, allegedly for private business. But Cobbett believed that OConnell had been offered a patent of precedence in the courts to take effect after the Emancipation Bill was passed. This information he had from Sheil who regarded it as a proof of the Governments benevolence. For Cobbett, this was clear evidence of a sell-out. Whether there was anything in Cobbetts suspicions is hard to tell. Cobbett was a man with deeply felt convictions; OConnell on the other hand usually gives the impression of being a lawyer using legal tactics which are abandoned if they are not yielding results. But most of those involved in Ireland just wished to put the matter into the past. As might have been expected OConnell retaliated in kind and abused Cobbett. The two were well matched when it came to invective. OConnell said Cobbett was only funny when he intended being serious. (The Times of London, no friend of Cobbett, printed an unflattering comment about him referring to  his still incorrigible habits of lying and swearing and swaggering and libelling and praising without the slightest regard for truth, propriety, subsequent detection or self-contradiction 6 Jan 1820. The notice on Cobbett in the DNB does not contradict this evaluation.)\n\nA meeting of the New Catholic Association held on 30 July with Counsellor OBrien in the chair and Frederick Conway as secretary for the day. It was reported that 151 gentlemen had subscribed as members, and these included Sir Edward Bellew, Sir Thomas Esmonde, and Nicholas Mahon. A proposal was made to ask for two persons in each parish in Ireland who would collect the Rent and furnish information. Sir Edward Bellew asked if any uniform had been decided on for the new Association for he had seen some gentlemen wearing buttons with the inscription New Catholic Association. He was told that it had been decided that there would be no common uniform, that the buttons were a private speculation, and that Mr OConnell would probably soon cease to wear the uniform he had devised for the Association. This uniform consisted of a blue frock coat with covered moulds, an inscribed button under the collar, a buff vest, and white pantaloons. Mr OConnell and some other gentlemen had worn it at the last meeting (SNL 1 August 1825). OConnell loved dressing up in uniforms. Any club or society could prescribe a form of dress to be worn at their meetings or on public occasions like parades. (It is not clear what exactly the word moulds refers to, whether buttons or piping OED.)\n\n[August 1825] Several meetings were held in August, but as most of those connected with the bar had dispersed to the various legal circuits to which they were attached to attend the assizes. (Barristers were assigned to one of the six circuits, and formed the bar of that Circuit. OConnell belonged to the Munster bar, and his appearances in courts outside Dublin were normally within the Munster circuit. He was best known and received his greatest support in the counties in Munster that comprised the Munster circuit. He had little personal contact with gentlemen in the counties comprising the other circuits.) The Catholic barristers, especially OConnell and Sheil, attended and spoke at numerous Catholic meetings in various places. Sheil never trusted himself to speak extempore, so all his speeches were carefully prepared. Also, unlike OConnell, he disliked repeating himself, so the speech for each meeting required long and careful preparation (DNB).\n\nThere was a well-attended meeting on Saturday 20 August in the Corn Exchange where Lord Gormanston took the chair. When the campaign for emancipation was over various people claimed to be the originators of the various strategies adopted. But at this point it would seem to have been Sheil who suggested plans for a systematic organisation, and for the systematic co-option of the Catholic clergy in Ireland in the campaign for better education which was one of the avowed objects of the Association . He began by proposing to the meeting that the secretary should get the name of every parish priest in write to him asking for his help.\n\nThus an individual and personal intercourse will be kept up with every parish priest, and we shall have an active and powerful agent in every parochial sub-division of the country.\n\nHitherto we have been desultory and irregular in our movements  one county petitioned at one time, another at a different period. There was no accordance in time or place, nor any simultaneous stirring of the nations mind. We must learn to kneel down together  we must be instructed in this exercise of genuflection; on the same day and at the same hour let there be a meeting held under the direction of the parish priest in every closet in Ireland (loud cheers). Offer to yourselves in anticipation the effect of such a proceeding. The cry for liberty sent up from the altars of God will reach into the cabinet, make its way to the throne, echo through the chambers of Westminster, and make even Eldon start. [ Eldon the Lord Chancellor of England was an inveterate opponent of the Catholic claims.]\n\nBut, I may be asked, can the Association effect all this? Not all. We have no right to petition for the redress of our grievances, but we are entitled by a specific clause to promote education. We shall array the clergy for an end which is perfectly legal, and when they have been once marshalled  when once the political apparatus has been prepared, it will be the office of another Association which can sit for fourteen days (the period allowed by law to an association for the redress of grievances to hold its sittings) to make use of the instruments with which they will have been previously provided (SNL 22 August 1825).\n\nA committee of 7 was appointed to choose members for an education committee as education was the principal object of the new Association. Among those proposed for the Education Committee were Primate Curtis, Archbishop Murray, Dr. Doyle, Lord Killeen, Lord Gormanston, Sir Edward Bellew, OConnell, Sheil, Nicholas Mahon, Frederick Conway etc. (DEP 20 Aug 1825). Sheil then proposed an adjournment of the Association until November, for the absence of so many gentlemen from the city might show the Association in a poor light. But an open Committee, which every member might attend, would be held every week.\n\nThe potentially valuable work of the Education Committee was negatived by the action of the Catholic bishops who preferred to treat education as a private concern, and to negotiate directly with the Government. The Government decided to negotiate with the bishops and not the Association and the National Education Act (1831) was based on the negotiations of the Government with the bishops. The result was that Catholic bishops, priests, brothers and nuns controlled almost all aspects of Catholic education in the nineteenth century in a manner inconceivable in the following century. It would seem that a great opportunity was lost of preventing the decline of education into pure sectarianism. There was also the fact that OConnell was extremely reluctant to spend the money collected for anything but political aims.\n\nActivity of the Committee virtually ceased during the autumn season, but many local meetings were held throughout the country.\n\n[October 1825] A meeting to petition was held in Co. Louth to petition parliament. Sir Edward Bellew was in the chair. The question of the wings was raised again, but there was no great feeling against OConnell. It was pointed out that Dr Doyle was prepared to concede them, though under protest.\n\nA rather surprising event occurred in October. The Lord Lieutenant, the Marquis Wellesley, now a widower, married a Catholic woman. After the official wedding according to the rite of the Established Church, Archbishop Murray performed the Catholic rite in the vice-regal lodge in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, the official residence of the Lords Lieutenant. His bride was a granddaughter of Mr Charles Carroll of Carrollstown, Maryland, the only Catholic to sign the American Declaration of Independence. Lord Liverpool took no action against him. The long-standing champion of Catholic interests in the Lords, the Earl of Donoughmore died and was succeeded in the title by his brother Lord Hutchinson. Lord Farnham, a leading anti-Catholic, succeeded him as an Irish representative peer. Lady Farnham was a leading proponent of the Second Reformation in Cavan. A general election was due the following year, and already moves were being made to select or oppose candidates. On 29 October 1825 a small meeting, the first since the adjournment, met, and OConnell called for a small Aggregate Meeting which would discuss the procedures for petitioning Parliament.\n\n[November 1825] The Little Aggregate Meeting was held on 2 November in the Corn Exchange. Mr Bric was called to the chair, and Conway acted as secretary. There was an entrance fee of one shilling and one penny. (Presumably, though the Irish currency had just been abolished, the sum was counted in Irish pennies of which 13 Irish pence made an English shilling, against twelve English pence.) Presumably this was necessary as the meeting was not to petition but to explain the procedures for petitioning, and also to ensure it counted as a private not public meeting. OConnell proposed concomitant meetings each week, one of the New Catholic Association, the other of successive meetings to petition. A committee of eleven was appointed to prepare petitions, including as always now Frederick Conway. The Little Aggregate Meetings were also called Separate Meetings. Though minutes were taken they were not read out and approved at the next meeting. These Separate Meetings were the most useful in the struggle for Emancipation for they enabled an organisation to be kept continuously in being. Any person who missed a meeting would have to ask someone who had attended what had happened, or get the minutes privately from the secretary. The efficient secretary Ed Dwyer seems to have been retained, for OConnell made him responsible for handling cash sent in as Rent. Real public Aggregate Meetings to adopt petitions, and Fourteen Day Meetings, could of their nature be held only rarely.\n\n[November, December 1825] A second small Aggregate Meeting was held on 9 November, again in the Corn Exchange, with Purcell OGorman in the chair and Mr FitzSimon as secretary. The faction led by Nicholas Mahon who opposed the wings in all circumstances still wanted to make a major issue of it, but Sheil defended OConnell. The latter still maintained that the freeholder vote was an illusion, as they were forced to vote for their Orange landlords. Some wanted to proceed with large provincial meetings, and Fourteen Day Meetings, but OConnell said it was necessary for these latter to wait for six months after the passing of the Act. Little Aggregate Meetings, and meetings of the New Catholic Association continued alternately throughout November and December, the one dealing with petitioning and the other with the other business. At a Little Aggregate Meeting OConnell had to warn the secretary not to read the minutes of the previous meeting. Nicholas Mahon continued striving to get a formal exclusion of the wings and Sheil deplored, to loud cheers, the perpetual raking over of who said what and when. Like Sheil, most gentlemen seem to have deplored the wings but realised that if their backers in Parliament introduced them they would have to accept them. It was a strict principle with all MPs and Lords that Parliament legislated not negotiated. The meetings were usually held on different days, but OConnell sometimes called a Separate Meeting before or after an Association meeting. Jack Lawless found it difficult to keep track of which was which.\n\nIt was proposed to revive the Catholic Association for fourteen days in January, for the purposes of petitioning on various subjects. It was also proposed that numerous local petitions should be adopted in the various counties, towns and parishes so that several of them could be presented every day that Parliament sat. It is not clear who first devised this tactic. It was used on a wide scale by the campaigners against slavery, and later in the decade by Protestant groups opposed to Emancipation. The idea put forward by Sheil of getting the addresses of each parish priest in Ireland made the scheme feasible. (A Catholic Directory covering all the dioceses in Ireland would not be published for another ten years.) OConnell recommended that several different specimen copies of petitions for Emancipation should be circulated. They should just petition for unqualified Emancipation and avoid any other topic.\n\nOn 14 and 15 December 1825 the Leinster Provincial Meeting took place in the Catholic chapel in Carlow with Lord Killeen in the chair to petition Parliament. A committee met on the 14th to prepare the petitions. At the meeting on 15th Dr. Doyle, whose lived in that town entered the meeting to give his account regarding the wings. He stated that he had reluctantly accepted the pensioning of the clergy, but if the Act had passed he would have resigned rather than accept Government money. Doyles exact reasoning is not very clear. OConnell considered that the priests could take the money and act independently of the Government as they always did. Nor was there any objection to prison chaplains, or army chaplains in India taking Government money. Nor was there later any objection by most of the clergy to Catholic priests, Brothers, or nuns taking Government money for schools. Sheil and OConnell were present and spoke. It was not exclusively a Catholic meeting. Sir Henry Parnell and Lord Cloncurry sent apologies (SNL 19. 20 December 1825)\n\nOn 19 December 1825, at a Separate Meeting, OConnell stated that the law officers of the crown were of the opinion that the Catholic Association itself could not re-assemble even for fourteen days. There was no point in quarrelling with their friends in the present administration over this point, so he proposed calling the Fourteen Day Meeting in January, the Catholic Association of 1826. A requisition calling for such a meeting was thereupon published in the newspapers under the names of Fingall, Gormanston, Killeen, Sir Edward Bellew, the brothers of the Earl of Kenmare etc. [Top]\n\nThe Campaigns of 1826 and 1827 (January 1826 to March 1827)\n\n[January 1826] The meetings of the New Catholic Association and the Separate meetings continued regularly. Frederick Conway was the secretary of the Education Committee of the New Catholic Association, and kept in touch with some of the Catholic bishops who kept him informed of the dealings between the bishops and Wellesleys Education Commissioners who were charged with implementing the Report of the Commission of Enquiry into Irish Education. OConnell still believed that the work of the New Catholic Association with regard to education was essential, and that the £50,000 that the Rent would provide would prove a powerful lure for the Catholic clergy. (When in 1831 the National Board of Education was set up to partially fund local primary schools, parish priests would have been delighted to get assistance from the Rent. But by that time the Rent was being used for other purposes.)\n\nPreparations were being made for the first of the Fourteen Day Meetings. Lawless proposed that instead of a subscription of £1 to cover the fourteen days, separate subscriptions for each day should be allowed. For he said that his experience of Catholic politics enabled him to say that the most pure and honest were to be found among those who were only able to pay a shilling for their admission. When it was put to the vote Lawless was defeated by 44 votes to 4. There can be little doubt that this means that the strongest opponents of the wings, and supporters of Lawless, were to be found among the tradesmen of Dublin (SNL 12 Jan 1826).OConnell claimed he had purchased the first ticket for the new temporary association. The Connaught Provincial Meeting met on 10 January 1826 in Ballinasloe with Lord Ffrench in the chair. On the same day a Catholic meeting was held in Monaghan with the local Catholic bishop in the chair.\n\nOn 16 January 1826 the Roman Catholic Association for 1826 met, and Lord Gormanston took the chair on the first day. Lord Fingall sent his apologies from Cheltenham in England where he was taking the medicinal waters. Killeen, seconded by OConnell proposed the Resolutions establishing the temporary association and they were quickly adopted. A governing committee consisting of Sir Edward Bellew, Sir Thomas Esmonde, Sir John Burke, the Hon. Mr Preston, the Hon. Mr Ffrench, and Messrs Sheil, Whyte, Russell, Grainger, Coppinger, and Lawless were appointed. The chair was taken on the second day by Lord Ffrench, and on the third day by Lord Killeen, and so on. Each session was occupied to the full. A Resolution calling for unqualified Emancipation without the wings was passed, though Sir Edward Bellew had a hesitation regarding the clerical wing, for the bishops were divided on the issue. It was decided to entrust the main petition to Lord Landsdowne in the Lords and to Sir Francis Burdett in the Commons. Mr Corley said he would prefer Mr Plunket which nearly made Lawless speechless. (Lawless put forward a motion condemning Plunket but it was not seconded.) OConnell eulogised Plunket. OConnell brought forward an alternative petition on the grounds of the breach of the Treaty of Limerick. (The alleged broken treaty of Limerick, like Cromwell, always had a prominent position in Irish national grievances. It was not a treaty but a capitulation of a city and was signed by the respective generals and ratified by William III after the siege of Limerick in 1692. It set out the terms on which the Jacobite largely Catholic army and their dependants, besieged in the city, could depart to France keeping their arms, and fixing a date for their submission to William. On their arrival in France the Catholic officers offered their services to the French king, as by the terms of the capitulation they were perfectly free to do. But in doing this they did not submit to William by the prescribed date.) After the 13th meeting on 29 January 1826, the Association adjourned sine die. All the meetings were reported at length in the Dublin newspapers (SNL 17 to 30 January 1826). This, the first of the Fourteen Day Meetings was the most successful. Friction and time wasted were at a minimum. All were united with regard to the kind of petitions to be put forward. The whole of the fourteen days were taken up with drafting petitions, discussing and revising them, and agreeing on strategy. Despite the efforts of Lawless, the wings issue was largely ignored, for it was realised that while the Catholics might express preferences the wording of the Bills would be out of their hands.\n\nThe Irish Catholic bishops were in Dublin at the same time to discuss their response to the proposals of the Education Commissioners. OConnell proposed that Lord Killeen, Sir Edward Bellew, and the Hon. Mr Preston should wait on the bishops. The bishops however did not discuss educational matters with them, and merely furnished them with a copy of their own resolutions on the subject. (These Resolutions of 1826 were to be a bone of contention among the Irish bishops for half a century, for some bishops regarded them as irreducible demands formally endorsed by all the bishops, while other regarded them as optimum requirements some of which would not be conceded.)\n\nThe only incident to mar the harmony arose when Mr Coppinger wished for a formal reply from the meeting to be sent to a meeting in New York which expressed sympathy with the oppressed Irish Catholics, and suggested separation from England as the remedy. This echo of the United Irishmen displeased many including Killeen, Bellew, OConnell, and Sheil. The proposal was put to the vote and defeated  amid a scene of uproar and confusion which we are unable to describe. OConnell and Sheil called for a public repudiation of the word separation used by Anthony Marmion of Co. Louth. This was done by acclamation. Marmion was one of the leaders of those attacking OConnell over the wings. The very last thing most Catholics wanted was to have their movement tainted by association with the United Irishmen (SNL 28 Jan 1826).\n\n[February 1826] Parliament resumed its sittings on 2 February 1826. A full Aggregate Meeting was held in Clarendon Street chapel on 14 and 15 February 1826 with Lord Killeen in the chair. The Hon. Mr Brown proposed that the petition be adopted, and he was seconded by Mr Thomas Wyse. Wyse had had an interesting career after parting with Ball and Woulfe in Rome in 1816. He travelled widely in the Near East, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Sicily along with Charles Barry, the architect of the House of Commons, sketching and measuring temples. Re-visiting Rome he met Napoleons brother Lucien, and married his daughter. He returned to Ireland in 1825. In a Resolution designed to undo the damage caused by the unfortunate word separation Sir Edward Bellew, seconded by Mr John OBrien, expressed the undivided loyalty of the Catholics. Lawless proposed a motion against the Algerine Act that was adopted. The Petition for Emancipation adopted by the Fourteen Day Meeting was adopted. OConnell called for a Twelve Day Board, and it was approved. This was to attend to the forwarding of the petitions to London, and so was legal (SNL 15, 16 February 1826).\n\nIn February a dinner was given to the prospective Liberal candidate for Waterford, Henry Villiers Stuart , a grandson of the 1st Marquis of Bute, at which Lord Killeen presided.\n\n[March 1826] The Accounts of the Old Catholic Association up to 18 March 1825 were published in the Dublin Evening Post. They showed that £8,886 had been collected in 1824, and £10,442 in the first three months in 1825. Cash in hand on that date was £14, 897 (about £600,000 nowadays; to arrive at this figure the pre-1914 value of the pound is multiplied by forty.) By July 1826 the sum in hand was reported to be £13,000 and there was considerable discussion if and how it could be used.\n\n[April 1826] On 17 April 1826 Lord Landsdowne presented the general Irish Catholic petition in the Lords, and paid tribute to the late Earl of Donoughmore. Grey introduced Lawlesss petition against the Algerine Act. Burdett introduced the general petition in the Commons. There were no motions on the petitions.\n\nOn 19 April 1826 Dr Milner passed away. He was active to the very end in his self-imposed task of saving the Catholic Church from itself.\n\nLandsdowne informed the Irish Catholics that if they insisted on an immediate motion on their petition he would hand over its direction to others. Lord Killeen, Sir Edward Bellew, and Sheil considered that they should defer to his judgement. OConnell and Sir Thomas Esmonde thought they should press on regardless. It was back to 1805.Without Landsdowne, the support of the senior Whigs in the Lords would be lost.\n\n[May 1826] An Aggregate Meeting was called for 9 May 1826 to resolve the dispute. It met in Clarendon Street chapel with Lord Gormanston in the chair. A committee was appointed to see that a motion, if practicable, was made in Parliament. A Resolution was passed that they would, at the coming General Election, support only those candidates who favoured Emancipation. A Mr Darcy Mahon proposed that £1,000 be given towards the relief of the distressed weavers in the Dublin Liberties, but was told that a special meeting would have to be called for this. This was not called by Purcell OGorman because of alleged irregularities in the signatures calling for one. Purcell OGorman received a vote of thanks for refusing to allow Catholic funds to be diverted (SNL 10, 22 May, 1 June 1826). OConnell said that one of those who had signed the requisition on behalf of the weavers was Sir Edward Bellew, a man who had never paid a penny towards the Rent. Bellew replied that he always paid in his own parish as they had been instructed to do.\n\nA letter from Joseph Hume MP, a leading Whig, was read out at a meeting saying the reason for the delay was that a General Election was imminent, and it was feared several of their supporters might lose their seats if too closely identified with the Catholic cause. Almost imperceptibly the character of Protestant objections to Catholic Emancipation were changing. At first it was chiefly political, a refusal to changed the order established in 1688 when the Protestant William replaced the Catholic James. But the evangelical movement was growing stronger almost by the day in England and Ireland. Objections now tended to be based on the need to combat the religious errors of Popery or to prevent the encroachments of Popery. Peel, within three years, was to feel the full force of this wave. The character of Protestant opposition in Ireland was changing too. Since the coming of the Marquis Wellesley it was no longer the opposition of an entrenched ruling class, relying on their positions and patronage to block reform. For the next thirty years, indeed until after the death of Peel, the old Ascendancy faction was to be in opposition. It was now more strongly than ever based on the religious prejudices of the ordinary grass roots Protestants. Protestant newspapers now flourished despite the fact that all Government subsidies were withdrawn from them. The officials in the Irish Government were now for the most part, and increasingly, in favour of Emancipation. Within a few years the great majority of the Protestant gentlemen in the counties were to support the Catholics.\n\n[June 1826] On 2 June 1826 Parliament was dissolved and a General Election was called. Plunket was returned unopposed for Dublin University. OConnell was active in some constituencies and wrote to influential people in others. He and Nicholas Mahon were very active in Dublin County which was always more liberal than the city. In Dublin county Lord Killeen proposed one of the candidates. Pro-Catholic candidates made some gains in Ireland but lost some in England where the strength of the anti-Popery faction was growing. The over-all balance in the Commons was unchanged, and Lord Liverpool remained prime minister.\n\nThe General Election in Ireland in 1826 is famous for the fact that the Whigs began to see a slight change in their direction. Ascendancy candidates who had been entrenched in constituencies like Louth and Waterford for as far as living memory stretched were seen to be vulnerable. Frequently in the past elections were uncontested. Contested elections were extremely expensive, and the total costs had to be borne by the candidate. A preliminary canvass was sometimes held among the great landowners, to see how they intended voting. If the result was clear one party might put up two candidates for the two seats, or the two parties might agree to put up one candidate each, and were declared duly elected by the sheriff. But if three or more candidates stood for election a public ballot had to be held. But often the great landowners agreed among themselves beforehand. The Beresfords had long dominated Waterford, and the Fosters had controlled Louth. In Waterford Thomas Wyse led the campaign of Henry Villiers Stuart against the Tory candidate Lord George Beresford, and Stuart won. OConnell joined in the campaign in Waterford. He was proposed and seconded as a candidate to enable him to address the voters indicating that he intended to withdraw, and telling them how to cast their votes. The papers reported the Mrs Bonaparte Wyse accompanied by a few other ladies sat in the gallery of the courthouse. If the sheriff decided that there must be a poll, he fixed the date and caused hustings (a raised platform) to be built outside the courthouse. (Mrs Wyse later left her husband and returned to France, but Bonaparte was retained by the Wyse family as a given name for over a century.) It was estimated that Wyse spent £10,000 of his own money on the election, about £400,000 nowadays. OConnell did not register himself as a freeholder and disbursed nothing from the Rent (Reynolds).\n\nIn Louth, a Whig gentleman named Alexander Dawson, decided to stand, and Sheil went to the county to assist him. Sir Edward Bellew became chairman of Dawsons election committee and proposed him. The Dublin Evening Post recorded that Lord Oriel (John Foster) had 397 registered voters among his tenants, Alexander Dawson 130, Sir Edward Bellew 118, and so on (DEP 20 June 1826). Landlords registered as many tenants as they felt they needed or could afford, and paid their registration fees. The Tories put up two candidates and the Whigs one. Curtis wrote to Murray that Sheil had come to an agreement with Fosters agent only to put up one candidate. It was the first contested election in Louth for fifty eight years. The decision to run a Whig candidate was taken only forty eight hours before the election. As Dawson was not wealthy it was agreed to assist with his expenses, and to engage Sheil from Dublin as principal speaker. Alexander Dawson and Leslie Foster were returned, Dawson polling 850 votes, Foster 550, and Fortescue 544. In Louth 1944 votes were cast, but many potential voters were not registered or were incorrectly registered. (Alexander Dawson had 356 votes rejected, Leslie Foster 162, and Mr Fortescue 106. The Whigs in Louth decided that next time, with proper organisation, they could take both seats. The Tory candidates in Waterford and Louth were not particularly anti-Catholic and had objection to retaining Catholic barristers. But the Whigs sensed that the log-jam was beginning to break, and with proper organisation many hitherto safe Tory seats could be taken. Dawsons total expenses in Louth was put at £2,000.OConnell proposed establishing an Order of Liberators whose purpose would be to organise elections. In some counties like Louth, Liberal Clubs were formed to promote the Whig interest. The problem with these was that the gentlemen of the county were still expected to pay all the expenses, and did not relish the idea that they would have to pay all the expenses of any candidate the Club put up. But these were problems for the next decade.\n\nSome of the Ascendancy faction was startled. The Westmeath Journal called for wholesale evictions of recalcitrant tenants, and distraining for arrears. OConnell claimed that actions against the tenants had begun. In Louth Lord Oriel, and Lord Roden the owner of the borough of Dundalk denied that they had any intention of retaliating.\n\nThere was an entirely different problem with regard to evictions, and this was caused by the fact that improving landlords were commencing to prohibit subletting, for in many parts of Ireland, lands were let, and then sub-let, and sublet again so that there could be as many as five landlords in a chain, the pieces of land getting smaller with each sub-letting. So eventually a farm of 1,000 acres could be parcelled out to 1,000 cultivators each with one acre. Each successive letting was naturally for shorter and shorter periods. To break the series, when the head lease of perhaps 99 years expired, the landowner had to evict the head tenant, who evicted his sub-tenants, who evicted his tenants and so on. Then the landowner could grant leases, probably to many of the same tenants, with an explicit clause prohibiting sub-letting. Because a large number of long leases came up for renewal around the same time, a Sub-Letting Act (1826) was passed in 1826 to regulate the matter ( Keenan II). Or they could evict a tenant at the end of his freehold lease, and offer him a leasehold in its place. Long leases had gone out of fashion, and were replaced by shorter leases. As communications improved so too did the value of agricultural land. Many landlords who had granted long leases at fixed rents found they derived no profit from the high prices for agricultural produce during the War, all of which went to the tenant. For this reason also evictions followed by short leases were preferred by landowners. Some could be offered land without a lease, and became tenants-at-will who could be evicted if ever the rent was not paid. Eviction was an emotive term, but it could amount to little more than a notice of eviction to compel the tenant to accept a more disadvantageous lease such as leasehold for freehold.\n\nThe other problem was caused by the fact that in the case of almost all tenants the first half years rent was not claimed, but remained due. This was called a hanging gale and the landlord could call it in at any time. Because of these two factors, the uncertainty regarding the renewal of the lease, and the hanging gale that could be called in at any time, most tenants preferred to humour their landlords. OConnell was perfectly aware of this, and knew that the Forty Shilling freeholders were most vulnerable to landlord pressure.\n\nThe resumption of land into the landowners hand was unconnected with elections, and proceeded steadily throughout the nineteenth century. But it was always possible for an unscrupulous person like OConnell to cry that the landlords were evicting. On the other hand, if a tenant was badly in arrears, and his chief use to the landlord was that he would vote as directed, if he failed so to do he was likely to be evicted. As OConnell argued, a steady tenant with a £10 freehold, and his rent paid up to date was unlikely to be evicted, for landlords would be very unwilling to evict steady tenants. There was also the point that while the rent was due to the landlord, it was collected by his agent, and that the agent, for this or any other reason might proceed with eviction notices. From notices in the newspapers it would seem that in Louth Baron Foster and Lord Roden stepped in to prevent evictions for the time being. Alexander Dawson confirmed that in Louth the landowners were not evicting, but their agents and understrappers were (DEP 31 August 1826).\n\nIndeed, any evicted tenant could claim that he was being evicted because he voted according to his conscience, and claim recompense from OConnells Rent. It was always possible that a tenant and his landlord could collude to get the rent paid up to date. OConnell refused to allow any of his Rent to be used to recompense alleged victims, and proposed that a separate collection should be made to assist them.\n\n[July 1826] At a meeting in July OConnell expressed the hope that the clergy would help in the collection of the Rent. Lawless feared that any attempt to directly involve the Catholic clergy might provoke a backlash among moderate Protestants, but OConnell said that if they did not undertake the relief they could be charged with betraying the people into misery (SNL 10 July 1826). He was determined however that the funds of the Old Catholic Association should be protected, and a special rent organised by the New Catholic Association should be used. Sheil suggested that Catholic ladies could be used to collect the Rent, as Protestant ladies distributed Bibles, and the Catholic ladies of Dublin had displayed great activity in getting Turnerellis altar erected in the new church in Marlborough Street. Later, in 1828, strict rules were drawn up; only those recommended by their parish priests could get relief; the lease and the landlords receipts for the previous twelvemonths must be produced; the recipient must enter into bail with some solvent person to repay the loan within a reasonable time; the parish priest should decide how much the applicant himself could pay; and finally the parish priest should decide if the distraint was normal, or whether it was solely due to voting against the landlords expressed wish (SNL 12 Aug 1828). Collection of the New Catholic Rent or Freehold Rent commenced in July. But, as usual activity came virtually to an end until the holiday season was over. It was OConnells custom, after the summer assizes to retire to his home in Kerry and remain there until the law courts re-opened for the autumn term.\n\n[August, September 1826] Reporting on the progress of the Catholic census, Conway had to report little success. This was an interesting project, for estimates regarding the ratio of Catholics to Protestants ranged from 6 to 1 to 3 to 1. Speculations regarding the revenues of the Established Church were equally vague. Of course, few at that time considered that if Catholics outnumbered Protestants by three to one they should have three quarters of the seats in Parliament. For Protestants had at least three quarters of the wealth, and so paid three quarters of the taxes. That the mob or hoi polloi, just because it outnumbered the rich, should decide the taxes and public spending was a view ruled out by Aristotle, and his view was accepted by succeeding generations. That was why, in the Middle Ages, to be allowed even to vote for a member of Parliament, one should have a freehold with at least forty shillings of taxable revenue. (The first decennial census which included a question on religious alle"
