        "text": "Subject: Collins on Trollope\n\nDate: Mon, May 29, 2000, 10:42 am\n\nTo forward to the Trollope list\n\nThe work attributing anonymous pieces in The Leader to Collins was done by an American professor Kirk H Beetz (Victorian Periodicals Review XV No.1 Spring 1982 pp 20-29. Beetz used Collins's letters, then unpublished, to attribute 51 pieces definitely to Collins and a similar number probably to him. They appeared between 1851 and 1856. Sadly Beetz did not fulfil his plans to publish Collins's collected items from The Leader. My role has been checking Beetz and copying the pieces for my own use.\n\nThe evidence for Collins's authorship of the review of The Warden is a letter from Collins to Edward Pigott, then the owner and editor of The Leader. On 3 February 1855 Collins wrote\n\n\"...Is anybody at work on Wolfert's Roost? or The Warden? - both of which I think of tackling this week.\"\n\nThose reviews appeared in The Leader on 24 February 1855 p187-188 (Wolfert) and 17 February 1855 p164-165 (The Warden) respectively.\n\nUnfortunately this important letter was not included in the recently published The Letters of Wilkie Collins, Baker and Clarke, Macmillan 1999.\n\nSadly The Leader is a very rare publication and few people have seen it or read Collins's pieces. Most were reviews of books, art, or plays, but he did write on a few other things. The Wilkie Collins Society plans to republish two of the items in the forthcoming issue of its Newsletter. More may follow.\n\nPaul Lewis\n\nmailto:paul@paullewis.co.uk web www.paullewis.co.uk\n\n47 Hereford Road, Acton, London W3 9JW United Kingdom\n\ntel 020 8993 2361 - fax 020 8992 1753 - mob 07836 217311\n\nI replied to all:\n\nRe: The Unsigned Notice in the Leader on The Warden\n\nIn response to Angela, Paul, and Joan,\n\nThe review printed as anonymous in Donald Smalley's Trollope: The Critical Heritage (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul & New York: Barnes & Noble, 1969), pp. 36-38, is dated 17 February 1855. It is the one identified by Prof Kirk H Beetz as by Wilkie Collins.\n\nWhat fascinates me most is the complete lack of any identification of the Leader as a socialist paper. Here in the USA where there is no socialist party or any effective organisation of socialists of any kind this is understandable. However, one of the publishers is English, and in the interests of historical accuracy as well as understanding why the reviewer takes the positions he does, one might think the real context or framing of this piece would be brought up. Not so. I should say I have talked to people about this Smalley production and it has been more than hinted that it has errors, does not pick the best of criticism by any means, and shows ignorance in some areas (this last comment comes from Skilton's book on reviewers and Trollope, Trollope and His Contemporaries). Of course no book is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and Smalley had only so many pages allowed him.\n\nStill were one to know that the paper was socialist, it would become clear where some of the writer's -- Collins's -- criticisms of The Warden are coming from. Throughout the piece Collins testifies to the highest respect for the author of The Warden. That Trollope starts with a real and important subject as opposed to most novels ('in these days ... people sit down to compose fictions, having nothing in the world to write about'), that Trollope fully reveals that the way the charity is administered is an egregious abuse of what was intended, that the man who exposes the abuse is the 'accepted lover of the good Warden's youngest daughter', and that the Warden himself is a well-meaning good man who has assumed he is fulfilling the terms of the bequest by 'bestowing the most watchful kindness and attention on the fixed number of destitute men whom the rules of charity place under his charge' -- are all strongly commended by the reviewer as a superb subject for a novel. What is assumed is a novel reaches so many people. Collins admires the 'delicacy and truth to nature' with which the Warden is drawn', the 'feeble old Bishop, his truculent and intensely clerical son', and 'the old men who live on the mismanaged funds'.\n\nWhat does the reviewer object to? 'The defective part of the book is the conclusion, which seems to us careless and unsatisfactory'. Alas, Collins does not make explict what he refers to here, but I suspect it is that the resolution does not come out clearly for or against how the charity has been perverted from its original intentions to support the ecclesiastical establishment. This complaint is made explicit in the Eclectic Review: \"A moral is wanting. To say nothing of the fact -- in itself significant -- that the views of the author on the subject of ecclesiastical revenue are not apparent, there is no fitting end attained by all which is done' (The Critical Heritage, ed. D Smalley, March 1855, nx. ix, 359-361, p. 39). What we see here is the Victorian educated reader read the novel as political fable. In Collins's case he looks for a political comment.\n\nBut Trollope's ultimate interests are elsewhere: in human nature, in realism, in paradigms of Trollope's own autobiography as seen in other of his novels (e.g., An Old Man's Love).\n\nAnother thing of interest are the three further complaints: Collins argues that Trollope 'speaks far too much in his own person in the course of the narrative'. It would seem an aesthetic standard is asserted here, but if we look at the example presented to explain what Collins means it seems it is also a matter of an upper class bias. Somehow it is higher art not to talk directly to an audience as a clown does in an pantomime. Great comedians, Collins says, never address their audiences directly. This is music hall stuff.\n\nCollins also objects to the 'want of thorough earnestness in the treatment of the subject'. Trollope distances himself too much; he mocks Eleanor's conflicts between love and duty when he should enter into them fully. James R. Kincaid's argument that Trollope was a subversive writer is vindicated here. Again Collins refers for his standard to an upper class standard: he alludes to Horace, the kind of text gentleman studied.\n\nI take this to be part of the objection to Trollope's mockery of Dickens and Carlyle. This kind of \"farce\" is a mistake, says Collins: \"Trollope is far too clever a man, and has far too discriminating an eye for character to descend successfully to such low literary work as that\". Note the use of the word \"low\". Again it's class bias; there is something vulgar, too practical and not removed enough from the realms of art in Mr Trollope. In its place in the review it is also clear that to Collins such farce disturbs the social and political criticism which the Leader wants to assume is Trollope's central purpose. The scene the reviewer quotes is the one by Grantley in which he threatens the old men with losing everything if they seek this improvement. They should be grateful for what they have. This is just the argument used today in many a debate: don't go for an improvement in health care because you might end up with something worse, or lose the little you have. It is a brilliant resonating emblem. Nonetheless, politics is not the final shaping element in The Warden or Trollope's art.\n\nI hope Angela's partner, Paul Lewis, or Prof Beetz make it more widely known that this review, familiar to all those who own the Critical Heritage is by Collins. It would go far to explain it and also how The Warden was originally read and partly intended. For I have no doubt that Trollope meant this novel to be read partly and strongly as a political statement as he meant his first & early works: two Irish books, The New Zealander and La Vendée\n\nCheers to all,\n\nEllen Moody\n\nDate: Mon, 29 May 2000 21:05:06\n\nReply-To: trollope-l@egroups.com\n\nSubject: [trollope-l] Further Unsigned Leaders in the Critical Heritage\n\nAllow me to add that there are a number of unsigned pieces from the Leader on Trollope's novels. The closest in time and voice to that on The Warden are on Barchester Towers (date 23 May 1857) and The Three Clerks (date 19 December 1857). These two read as if written by the same man who wrote the review of The Warden. Dr Thorne (29 May 1858) and The Bertrams (25 April 1859) were also written about in the Leader and enough is given of the first of these to suggest it is again the same man who is writing.\n\nCheers to all,\n\nEllen Moody\n\nDate: Sat, 03 Jun 2000 09:37:20 +0100\n\nReply-To: trollope-l@egroups.com\n\nSubject: Re: [trollope-l] The Unsigned Notice in the Leader on The Warden\n\nThank you Ellen for responding so thoroughly. There are many points about the Leader and the review of the Warden that are interesting. It was an anti-establishment paper which criticised the Church (and reminds me of the paper in the Warden itself).\n\nWhat struck me about Collins' tone was the sheer confidence of the 20 something who had after all very few novels under his belt. Its interesting that his very first novel, Iolani, which he couldn't get published, also addressed the reader directly. I was initially thinking how presumptious it was of him to write in this tone about a more established author, but when I checked I could see that they were both pretty much on a par as would-be successful novelists. I suppose Trollope didn't need to earn money writing reviews at that time, as Collins did, because he was in the civil service.\n\nPaul will be going to the Library today to check out the other unsigned pieces you identify but he is not confident they will prove to be by Collins. Apparently, he had a falling out with the Leader over religious views and may not have been writing at that later date.\n\nThanks for giving this so much thought.\n\nAngela\n\nMeanwhile people had begun to talk about church politics in the Barsetshire series:\n\nRe: [trollope-l] Pre-ramble to Barchester Series\n\nJill Singer had responded to something Gene Stratton wrote:\n\nThe discussion about the contemporary problems facing the Church and the difference between High/Low Church are enlightening. I wonder if someone would be kind enough to wax even more basic and provide the basic \"hierarchy\" of Church officials. Being Jewish, I have always been fairly vague about who ranks above whom in the novels.\n\nJill Singer\n\nSo Gene replied:\n\nJill: Please don't take the following as gospel (no pun intended) but this is my understanding of the hierarchy under the Anglican Communion:\n\nThe head of the Church of England is the King or Queen. However, the sovereign is now but a figurehead and Parliament reigns supreme and, within political tolerances, can make or change whatever church rules it wishes. This was one of the concerns of many Victorian Tories who were only lukewarm at best about the church being \"established\" by law, for they feared \"half-atheist\" members of parliament might be able to appoint the bishops and completely change the complexion of the church.\n\nThe two highest clerics are the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York, with Canterbury having somewhat more powers than York. England is divided into so many bishopric sees subordinate to one or the other of these two archbishops. L. G. Pine, The Story of Titles, 1969, [note the possibility of Pine being outdated now] states that \"The Archbishop of York is Primate of England and Canterbury Primate of all England, behind which distinction is a long history of unseemly bickering.\" I guess the number of bishops has changed over the years, and someone else might have today's division between Canterbury and York. Pine has the total number of Lord Bishops in the Established Church as 43.\n\nArchbishops are termed Right Reverend and Most Honourable, and they are addressed as Your Grace. Interestingly in regard to our discussion of Archbishops, according to Pine there is still a Protestant Archbishop fo Armagh and he is Primate for all Ireland. Bishops rank next in the hierarchy and are responsible for their respective sees. Pine says that most bishops are termed Doctor, even though few of them have such degrees, earned or honourary.\n\nDeans appear to be next in rank and are addressed as Very Reverend. The dean is the head of a cathedral, or perhaps more properly a cathedral chapter, which means all the clerics assigned to a given cathedral, each of whom is generally known as a canon, in addition to his other title(s). Or a cathedral may be headed by a provost. Pine says that in the modern church of England there are 14 provosts and 29 deans (interestingly totaling 43, the number of bishops with sees, and I believe there is a cathedral in every see). Barchester Cathedral has a dean.\n\nArchdeacons are the administrative heads of the sees, and might be termed the diocese's business head. They are termed Venerable Sir, and called Mr. Archdeacon in speech.\n\nThe head of a given church may be a rector or a vicar or parson, and he (or she in current times) is frequently said to hold the \"living.\" The living is a feudal power whereby someone has the frequently hereditary right to appoint a clergyman to a vacant church. Sometimes this power is vested in an important local landowner, and sometimes in a bishop or dean, or other.\n\nThe rector need not assume charge of his church in person, but may appoint a curate to handle day-to-day or year-to-year or decade-to-decade affairs. One of the abuses attacked in Victorian times was the favoritism shown to some influential clerics who could be appointed rectors to one or several churches at, say, 800 pounds a year each, and then be absent, say, in Paris, for many years, paying a curate perhaps 80 or 100 pounds a year to handle all sermons and other church matters. This was known as pluralism. The Rev. Dr. Vesey Stanhope in Barchester Towers was an absentee vicar living many years in Italy.\n\nThe above is a quick and dirty sketch, but it may suffice for some to put the titles in the Barchester stories in proper perspective. I'm sure some others can improve on this and perhaps correct parts. I'm also sure that it would be tremendously difficult to explain the entire Anglican Church hierarchy in any kind of outline form, for there are too many exceptions. Think of it as the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; every time some politician wants to do a constituent a favor, new exceptions are made to the Code, and in the Church of England this has been going on for over 400 years. Case in point: Probate is (or perhaps was, for I may be somewhat behind times) handled by the local diocese. Probates crossing diocesan lines are handled by the Probate Court of Canterbury (PCC) or Probate Court of York (PCY). However, if you are trying to locate an old will, you have to know that exceptions were always being made so that some probates are/were handled by clerical authorities known as Peculiers (note the spelling).\n\nAnother example which may show how difficult it is to make straight, short, simple definitions comes up when we try to decide if a given church is under a vicar or rector. In the Anglican Church a rector is the head of a church \"where the tithes are not impropriate\" (from Chambers English Dictionary). A vicar is the parson of a parish church who receives only the smaller tithes or a salary. I don't pretend to know the distinctions, but only know that some fine distinctions exist. Archdeacon Grantly was the rector of Plumstead Episcopi. Dr. Stanhope was the vicar of Crabtree Canonicorum. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about the Church of England could tell us if some of these distinctions have dissolved over the years.\n\nThere are numerous other titles in the Church, such as a prebendary, a resident clergyman who enjoys a share in the revenues of a cathedral or collegiate church; and a precentor, who is the choir leader (such as Mr. Harding). Note that Mr. Harding was a both precentor and a warden of an almshouse.\n\nThis may tide you over until better information is available.\n\nGene Stratton\n\ngwlit@worldnet.att.net\n\nGene wrote again:\n\nSubject: [trollope-l] Pre-ramble to Barchester Series\n\nI don't think the following is a spoiler, but some people might be more fastidious than I about such matters, and so I want to give them a chance now to press the delete key. Essentially the following discusses some Church of England background to the first two Barsetshire novels.\n\nList members know or will soon find out that the Reverend Mr. Septimus Harding is the protagonist of The Warden, and in fact -is- the Warden. David Skilton in his Introduction to the OUP World's Classics series of The Warden says that Mr. Harding had held his position \"since before the days when such things as the disportionate size of a warden's income were considered abuses.\" This is both possible and likely, but I think it could give an erroneous impression.\n\nThere seems to be a popular misconception that at the time The Warden was written (1855), the public was just beginning to become aware of financial abuses by the Church of England, when actually the public had been long aware of them.\n\nI'm reading Owen Chadwick, The Victorian Church, 2 vols., 1966 & 1970, Oxford Univ. Press, which C. P. Snow in his biography Trollope calls \"essential reading for the Barchester novels.\" This may be somewhat exaggerated, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have some familiarity with the Anglican Church of Trollope's times when reading these novels.\n\nLet me give a thumbnail sketch of the background of the Victorian religious situation (with profound apologies to those who are already well aware of it). Henry VIII (died 1547) split from the Catholic Church when the Pope would not allow him to divorce his first wife so he could marry the second of his six wives. Much beheading and burning at stakes followed, and the Church of England was born. It was still essentially Catholic, but no longer Roman, and now had the King (or Queen) of England (Defender of the Faith) as the head instead of the Pope.\n\nCatholics remained strong even into the late 17th century, when James II was ousted in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 by his own daughter and her Dutch husband, who jointly ruled as William and Mary. During the Reformation in Europe, England, too, saw the rise of many \"dissenting\" Protestant churches, later followed by Quakers and Methodists. But the Church of England was the official church, established by law, which required, among other things, that everyone pay tithings to it even though they attended some other church. All wills, even for dissenters, had to be probated through the Church of England. This Church of England, or Anglican Church, also had a number of other privileges in law that other churches lacked, such as its bishops' being automatically members of the House of Lords. Non-Anglican church members at various times and to varying degrees suffered various forms of persecution, although the general trend was to allow them more freedom. Eventually dissenting religionists were allowed to be Members of Parliament, but still no Catholic or Jew could be.\n\nThe following comes from Chadwick, who in his books points out that the Whigs were eager for Catholic emancipation as early as 1829. And this is the real point of my ramblings, that it was around 1830 that popular feeling became enraged against the abuses of the Church of England, some 25 years prior to the writing of The Warden. Chadwick also observes that this was not the first time that the Church had come under attack.\n\nThis was also the time of the 1st Reform Bill, when the electorate was enlarged and various political, as well as Church, abuses began to be corrected. The 1st Reform Bill was finally passed and enacted into law in 1832, but earlier it had suffered several defeats. When reform was defeated in the House of Lords in 1831, with the aid of the votes of the Bishops, popular enmity against the clergy raged hot. There were mobs in the streets, and the recent Tory Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington (once England's hero following his 1815 victory over Napoleon at Waterloo) was villified, with rioters even throwing stones through the windows of his London residence, Apsley House.\n\nOne popular method of non-violently attacking the Church was by displaying placards showing the fantastic incomes of various high-ranking Church leaders. But signs of real revolution were in the air, feared alike by the clergy, the Whigs themselves, and the level-headed Tory politician Robert Peel, who around this time thought that the monarchy could not last more than another six years in England.\n\nAnd, horror of horrors for the later Trollope (who was only around 16 years old at this time), there was even a strong movement \"to end parsons who hunted.\"\n\nI mention this to show that long before Trollope wrote The Warden (triggered as it probably was by some specific Church abuses of the time that he conceived the idea) the Church was not only unpopular with many people, but Church and political leaders had been under much stronger attack than I had believed before I started reading Chadwick. By the time of the Barchester novels, this enmity against the Church was entering its second generation.\n\nAnd this was still just the beginning. Darwin's publication of The Origin of Species in 1859 began a new kind of intellectual challenge to the Church of England, but that's another story. The amazing thing seems to be how on earth was it able to continue as the State Religion even into our own times? (N.B. This is all reportorial and is not intended to be offensive to members of any faith.)\n\nAnd now for a question: I know that England has two Archbishops, those respectively of Canterbury (the premier Archbishop) and of York. But Chadwick (1:31) refers to three (!) Archbishops voting in the House of Lords in 1832. Who was the third? Did the Anglican Church in Ireland (called the Church of Ireland) have at that time its own Archbishop?\n\nNow don't you wish you had pressed that delete key? ;-)\n\nGene Stratton\n\nTo which Michael O'Neile replied:\n\nGene,\n\nI much appreciated your background on the evolution of the Church of England. Would the third Archbishop have been Westminster?\n\nA question for you (two-parts) - how did the High/Low church split occur? which is the basis of \"The Warden\"?\n\nMichael\n\nHe was answered by Virginia Preston:\n\nEither Ireland or Wales I think. The Irish Church was disestablished in 1869 and the Welsh Church in 1919, at which point they lost their episcopal representation in the Lords - I don't know which of them had an archbishop there. Michael suggested it might be Westminster, but actually there isn't an Anglican Archbishop of Westminster - it's a Roman Catholic post, currently held by Cardinal Hume (and of course not in existence at the time we are discussing, as the Catholic hierarchy had not been restored then).\n\nVirginia\n\nvpreston@icbh.ac.uk\n\n(drawing breath for a discussion of what high and low mean in the Church of England)\n\nGene Stratton:\n\nHi, Michael. Thanks for your message. Let me answer the first part now and perhaps attempt the second later. Unfortunately the answer will not be satisfactory. The third archbishop must have been the Anglican Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. So far, so good. But although I'd read this before, the significance must have passed over me until I rechecked it: On pp. 53-54 Chadwick points out that the Church of Ireland, a distinct minority in Ireland, received tithing from all the Irish, although often the rectors \"maintained the common and courteous habit of not troubling the [local] Catholic priest for his tithe\"!!! More to the point, this church seemed a bit top-heavy with 4 archbishops (!!!) and 18 bishops. We seem to have a surfeit of archbishops. Could it be that only the Archbishop of Dublin was in the House of Lords? I just don't know.\n\nFor an interim quick-and-dirty attempt at answering your 2nd question, I'd say that High Church essentially leaned toward Roman Catholic rites and was non-evangelical, and Low Church was both evangelical and more bare-bones Protestant. I believe the High-Low Church division enters more into Barchester Towers than The Warden, for after the death of Bishop Grantly, the contest both to become the new bishop and to dominate the diocese following the new bishop's election is between the Archdeacon Grantly high-church group and the Proudie/Slope low-church group. However, this explanation may be simplistic, and if I find it is, I'll address your 2nd question again. In real life during Trollope's time, we see some high-church Anglican dignataries eventually converting over to Roman Catholicism, with Newman and Manning becoming cardinals in that church.\n\nGene Stratton\n\ngwlit@worldnet.att.net\n\nI replied to Gene, Michael and Virginia:\n\nRe: Pre-ramble to Barchester Series\n\nLike Gene, I am going to tell some details of the book in the following; all of these come from the opening 3 chapters of the book. However, if you do not want to read about these chapters as yet, do not read on.\n\n**************************************\n\nI too enjoyed Gene's historical account; what's more he brings to the fore the background to the book a modern reader won't assume. Many people reading this book see it as a sweet story about an apparently mild man who demonstrates an unusual moral courage. So far, so good. In the background they feel a pastoral at work and much nostalgia; what they don't know is that Trollope is also writing a political novel about a hot issue of his day. One may see in the psychological give-and-take of the political events of the book a subtle parable about the way politics works, but it's not just allegorical. It is grounded in the real world of 1852.\n\nWhen we open the book we discover a story about a church official who does almost nothing; who is, in comparison with the rest of society at the time, leading a supine, comfortable life, and gets an enormous income. At the sametime, very early on, we learn the people whom the founder of the wardenship meant to have the money are only receiving what is a pittance when the founder meant them to have some sort of independence from their income, even if a very modest one. The story begins when someone begins publicly to protest this egregiously unbalanced distribution of income. In the Trollope Society edition of the novel, Chadwick points out that Trollope did have a specific real incident in mind that had become something of a cause célèbre in the press. When we get started we will have the details before us.\n\nStill even without these, if we know the background as we begin to read, we could liken The Warden to a cherry bomb thrown at a barricade on one side of which are those who are angry at the use of their money (tithes are taxes). This anger leads to protests against the lack of real religious spirit in the upper clergy; their use of curates to do the ministerial work; the way they are chosen based on who they know, how much money they can pay or who they are. The average person in England worked a long workweek for very little. On the other side of the barricade are those who would of course stand firm on behalf of their lifestyle and privileges, their caste. Michael Sadleir argues The Warden is a book about caste-arrogance as much as anything. (Castes include lawyers like Sir Abraham Haphazard.) Characteristically Trollope does not call our attention to a profligate: rather he shows us an ordinary man who has been lucky; he has been offered this income, place, and has to the best of his small ability, done what he could for his men -- without of course taking away from himself the life offered him by the place. Who would refuse this? Most of us leap at offers we are given -- and sometimes all the while knowing just how corrupt and unfairly the positions are allotted out and the incomes (I think of the modern American university system.) So on the other side of the barricade there is this one man. As we are told almost upon meeting him, he has even gotten into debt and been bailed out by his son-in-law (Archbishop Grantly) because he loves music and wants to publish learned works on it. We may conclude that if the Warden had not lucked into his income, he might not have fared very well in this world.\n\nThe 'crisis of conscience' of the book is thus not a private matter at all. Nor one which is not still relevant to us and our attitudes towards work and money today.\n\nAnd the more we know about the hot political background the more we'll get out of the book. I didn't know about the riots Gene mentioned nor the larger history of the 1830s with respect to the church.\n\nEllen Moody\n\nSomeone asked for some distinction between high and low church and how these terms came about:\n\nVirginia Preston wrote:\n\nHigh Church as a term starts being used in the 17th century, I think, to describe people like the Arminians who wanted to go on being as Catholic as possible, preserving many of the pre-Reformation traditions, stressing the sacraments (I believe that officially the CofE only has 2, as opposed to the RC 7, but High Churchmen will often promote practices like auricular confession) and the authority of bishops. After the Restoration of Charles II they were quite strong, then I think they declined a bit and came into their own again in the 19th century - the Oxford Movement is extremely High Church, with Keble and others writing Tracts (the first one was published in 1833) in defence of Catholic doctrines. Newman eventually published one (1841) which tried to prove that the 39 Articles are compatible with Catholic theology and was very unpopular with the Evangelicals.\n\nI don't know when people started using the term 'Low Church' but it means those who emphasise preaching, the centrality of the Bible and the importance of the Reformation. At the end of the 18th century and early 19th, there was an Evangelical revival which was also connected to the anti-slavery movement and things of that kind - the Earl of Shaftesbury was an Evangelical. They then got tied up fighting the High Church/Anglo-Catholics.\n\nThen there is the Broad Church, which attempts to avoid the fights between both these movements. Bishops weren't actually very keen on the Oxford Movement, and I think a lot of them belonged to the Broad Church - they didn't like Biblical literalism either, preferring to emphasise the national comprehensiveness of the Church of England, and prepared to consider the results of contemporary scientific and historical study. Benjamin Jowett (Master of Balliol 1870-93) was a Broad Churchman and so was Charles Kingsley.\n\nArchibald Tait, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1868 was one of those who protested against Newman's Tract. He was personally low church, but like the 'Broad Church' believed in the comprehensiveness of the Church of England and vetoed prosecutions for ritualism.\n\nVirginia\n\nvpreston@icbh.ac.uk\n\nThen Tyler Tichelaar added:\n\nReply-to: trollope-l@onelist.com\n\nSubject: [trollope-l] High and Low Church\n\nFrom: 96TICHELAAR@wmich.edu\n\nI have consulted Daniel Pool's What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew about the question between High and Low Church. He breaks down the difference as primarily being that the High Church tended to go in more for ceremony and ritual, while the Low Church preached the desperately sinful nature of man and they abhorred ceremony and ritual. Part of the separation is due to the ceremeony in the High Church which was bordering upon Catholocism. If I am remembering my history rightly, eventually this problem even caused the High Church groups to have splits, and people like John Henry Newman, a member of the Oxford movement, who advocated the Anglican church becoming almost completely Catholic eventually left the Anglican Church and converted to Catholicism, as did John Henry Manning. This desire for a return to Catholicism was also a desire for medieval reform, growing out of the popular Victorian medievalism. Pool says that in 1874 was passed the Public Worship Act which tried to find a middle common ground between the two factions. As a result, many Anglican churchmen actually went to jail for introducing \"allegedly\" Catholic practices into their worship. Pool also mentions the Proudies as part of the Low Church establishment, while Archdeacon Grantly was of the old-fashioned High Church group, which would have disliked the Proudie's low Church feelings, and the newer, more Catholic faction inside the High Church.\n\nTyler Tichelaar"
