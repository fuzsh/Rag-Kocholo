        "text": "The abbots, bishops and archbishops of Armagh are listed on a panel on the north wall. The succession is unbroken since Patrick. Until the Reformation, this Cathedral was a centre of an undivided Irish Church. However, by the Acts of Supremacy of 1534 and 1559 Henry VIII and Elizabeth I renounced the jurisdiction of the Pope. The first Act declared Henry ‘the only supreme head on Earth of the Church of England’. The second made Elizabeth its Supreme Governor, a title still in use today. As the Reformation was extended to Ireland, the succession of archbishops of Armagh divided. In 1539 The Pope deprived George Cromer for suspected heresy. Although the succession was re-united under Queen Mary, from 1558 the Roman Catholic succession follows Donagh O’Tighe (1560). That of the Church of Ireland follows Adam Loftus (1563).\n\nThe cathedral contains a number of monuments to previous archbishops, especially from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."
