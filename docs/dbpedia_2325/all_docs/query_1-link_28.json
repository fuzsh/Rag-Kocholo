        "text": "This book is not available for download. It explores a key diocese of the Irish Church during the age of Reformations in unprecedented detail and succeeds in presenting as much as we can possibly know about pastoral care, ministry, church administration and finance in a 16th Irish diocese, and it dissects in as much detail as the evidence allows the impacts of the religious policies of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary in Armagh diocese.\n\nDespite modern writers noticing the importance of Premodern historiographical phenomena for a deeper comprehension of both Theory of History and History of Historiography, the Irish contribution to the subject is often left aside. Topics such as the Seanchas Tradition and Medieval Irish Classicism are not well integrated into such historiographical narrative. The Seanchaidh, the Irish Artifex of the Past, for example, is broadly mentioned as not a historian, but a chronicler, antiquary, genealogist, hagiographer or pedigree systematizer. This article addresses these issues and, more specifically, we focus on two Irish narratives produced in 7th century by Muirchú and Tírechán. Since they belong to the world of orality and bilingual literacy of Early Christian Ireland, perhaps their works could be understood as bounded by the Seanchas Tradition and Medieval Irish Classicism, hence, both could be considered as great examples of the producers of History and Historiography at the time."
