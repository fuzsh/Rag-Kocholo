        "text": "Archiepiscopal title\n\nFor other uses, see Archbishop of Armagh (disambiguation).\n\nThe Archbishop of Armagh is an archiepiscopal title which takes its name from the city of Armagh in Northern Ireland. Since the Reformation, there have been parallel apostolic successions to the title: one in the Roman Catholic Church and the other in the Church of Ireland. The archbishop of each denomination also holds the title of Primate of All Ireland.\n\nIn the Church of Ireland, the archbishop is John McDowell, who is the ecclesiastical head of the Church of Ireland and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Armagh.[1] He was elected as archbishop in March 2020 and translated to the role on 28 April 2020.[2][3]\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, the archbishop is Eamon Martin, who is the ecclesiastical head of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, metropolitan of the Province of Armagh and the ordinary of the Archdiocese of Armagh. He succeeded on 8 September 2014, having been ordained Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh on 21 April 2013 at St Patrick's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Armagh.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the medieval Irish church, the earliest bishops doubled as abbots, with the bishop becoming the junior of the two positions. From the 8th century, if not earlier, the house of Armagh claimed foundation from Saint Patrick, and the position of comarba Pátraic (\"successor of Patrick\") was held by the abbot of Armagh until the position of abbot and bishop were merged again in the 12th century, with the creation of the archbishopric of Armagh.\n\nEarly abbots and bishops of Armagh\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly abbots and bishops of Armagh Tenure Ordinary Notes. dates uncertain Saint Patrick\n\nIrish: Pátraic Founder of the bishopric in around 444; resigned, but date unknown; died 17 March, but the year is uncertain, the Annals of Ulster record the repose (i.e., death) of three bishops of the same name in 457, 461 and 493; also known as Patricius or St Patrick. d. 447/8 (or 457) (Saint Secundinus\n\nIrish: Sechnall mac Restituit) Occurs in the list in the Book of Leinster; served as an assistant to Bishop Pátraic; considered to be the founder of Dunshaughlin (Domnach Seachnaill); died 27 November 447/8 (or 457); also known as Seachnaill and St Secundinius.[5] dates uncertain (Sen-Phátraic) Occurs in the list in the Book of Leinster, but may not really existed; his name means \"Old Patrick\"; died 24 August, but the year not recorded, however, the Annals of Ulster record the \"repose (i.e., death) of the elder Patrick\" in 457. d. 467/8 Benignus of Armagh\n\n(Saint Benan; Benén mac Sescnén) Died 9 November 467 or 468. d. 481 Saint Iarlaithe mac Treno Died 11 February 481; also known as Saint Jarlath. d. 497 Saint Cormac of Armagh Called bishop and abbot; styled heres Patricii in the Annals of Ulster, 'first abbot' in the official list; died 17 February 497. d. 513 Dubthach the First Called bishop; also known as Dubtach. d. 526 Saint Ailill the First Called bishop; died 13 January 526; also known as Ailid or Olild . d. 536 Saint Ailill the Second Called bishop; died 1 July 536; also known as Ailid. d. 548 Saint Dubthach the Second Called abbot; perhaps identical with Bishop 'Dauid Farannaini' (Dauid mac Guairi ui Farannáin), whose death is appended in a late hand in the Annals of Ulster in 551; also known as Duach, but see entry for Fiachra mac Colmain. d. 558 Saint Fiachra mac Colmain Called abbot. d. 578 Saint Fedelmid Find Called abbot. d. 588 Saint Carláen Called bishop; died 24 March 588; also known as Cairlan, Ciarláech and Cairellán. d. 598 Eochu macDiarmaid Called abbot; also recorded as Eochaid. d. 610 Saint Senach Called abbot. d. 623 Saint Mac Laisre Called abbot; died 12 September 623. d. 661 Saint Tómméne Called bishop; died 10 January 661; also recorded as St Tommine . d. 688 Saint Ségéne Called bishop; died 24 May 688; after Ségéne the Book of Leinster inserts an unnamed Forannán with the reign of 1 year. d. 715 Saint Fland Feblae mac Scandláin Called abbot and bishop. d. 730 Saint Suibne Called bishop; died 21 June 730; also known as Suibne nepos mac Crundmaíl or Suibne nepos Mruichessaich. d. 750 Congus Called bishop (also scribe) Source(s):[6][7]\n\nLater abbots and bishops of Armagh\n\n[edit]\n\nAbbots of Armagh\n\n[edit]\n\nLater abbots of Armagh Tenure Ordinary Notes. d. 758 Célé Petair Also known as Céile Petair from Crích Bresail, or Cele-Peter. d. 768 Saint Fer dá Chrích mac Suibni ? res. c. 772 Cú Dínaisc mac Conasaig Possibly resigned c. 772; died 791. d. 793 Dub dá Leithe I mac Sínaig Member of the Clann Sinaig. dep. 793 Fóendelach mac Móenaig Deposed. d. 794 Airechtach ua Fáeláin Died on the same night as Bishop Affiath; also known as Airechtach grandson of Faelán alias grandson of Fledach. d. 795 Fóendelach mac Móenaig (again) Re-installed. d. 806 Gormgal mac Dindataig Also abbot of Clones; omitted from the list together with Fland Roí mac Cummascaig, who took the abbey by force (his grandfather, Conchobar, was killed in 698), rival to Fóendelach; also known as Gormgal mac Dindanaig, mac Dindagaid, or mac Indnotaig. d. 807 Condmach mac Duib dá Leithe Member of the Clann Sinaig; in opposition to abbots Fóendelach and Gormgal; recognised as coarb in the Annals of Ulster in 804. d. 808 Torbach mac Gormáin Died 16 July 808. d. 809 Toicthech ua Tigernaig Not in the official list. d. 812 Saint Nuadu of Loch Uama Also bishop of Armagh and anchorite. d. 826 Flandgus mac Loingsig Also known as Fergus mac Loingsig. deposed 827/8 Artrí mac Conchobair Acted as abbot and Coarb (or possibly on behalf of Flandgus) in 818, 823, 825; also was bishop of Armagh from 794; died 833. d. 830 (?
