        "text": "In 1738 an English clergyman, William Preston, travelled to Ireland to settle himself in comfort and dignity as rector and vicar of the parish of Tullow in County Carlow. Of Ireland he knew little; of County Carlow nothing. After coming down from Oxford, Preston had spent two years as a tutor with the Southwell family near Bristol, and a further two years as a curate in Hertfordshire.1 His luck turned when Tullow fell vacant and the proprietor of the advowson, the absentee Lord Arran, asked the Southwells for a recommendation. The rectory must have seemed a plum, for it had been much envied when the previous incumbent had been installed.2 However, Prestonâ€™s apparent good fortune proved a mirage."
