This book is therefore the first one-stop volume of Irish historical facts and figures, a book that will, we hope, assist scholars, students, journalists, civil servants, and general readers to avoid endless hours of rummaging through obscure and hard-to-find files and publications. Choosing what to include in a publication such as this can often be the most difficult task. In deciding, we have had to consider relevance, accuracy, reliability, availability and completeness. This is no easy task, especially when it is accompanied by the perennial constraints of academic publishing, namely space, deadlines and teaching commitments. Nevertheless, the team at Pearson Education have been unstinting in their encouragement and support. Our work colleagues have also been generous, both in supplying encouragement and, in many cases, informed corroboration. In view of the help we have received, it might be wise to reaffirm that the final responsibility for the accuracy of this book lies with the authors. In doing so, we acknowledge the possibility for human error, and the problems inherent in certain sources. It is partly for that reason that we have striven to include sources. But their inclusion will also allow readers to follow up the information contained herein should they chose to do so. Two sources in particular deserve special mention: the annual yearbooks published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland, Dublin, and by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NIAAS), Belfast. There are, of course, many other sources, institutions, and people who have helped us at various stages, including: Ark: Northern Ireland Political and Social Archive; Bodleian Library, Oxford; British Academy; Garda Museum and Archives; Greyfriars, University of Oxford; Honourable Society of King’s Inns, Dublin; Institute of Historical Research, University of London; Institute of Irish Studies, Queen’s University Belfast; Law Society of Ireland; Linen Hall Library, Belfast; Main Library, Queen’s University Belfast; Northern Ireland Court Service; Nuffield Foundation; Presbyterian Historical Society; St Patrick’s College, Maynooth; Trinity College, Dublin and the Wesley Historical Archive, Belfast.
