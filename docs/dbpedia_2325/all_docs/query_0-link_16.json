ON the 4th day of the creation, at noon, according to Kennedy, the earth first received its diurnal motion.\n\n3015. Universal corruption overspread the world. Destruction of men resolved on.\n\n1921. The number of false divinities multiplying, gave occasion to the vocation of Abraham.\n\n604. By order of Necho, king of Egypt, some Phoenicians sailed from the Red Sea round Africa, and returned by the Mediterranean.\n\n331. A great many Roman ladies poisoned their husbands; 170 of them suffered death for it. This was the first example of such a crime.\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nAfter Christ.\n\n26. Nine hundred Roman soldiers taking shelter in a wood, having been cut to pieces, after a noble defence, by the Frisians, a people beyond the Rhine, it had such an effect on the Roman army in general, that 400 other soldiers that had retreated within a house, fearing they should be betrayed, killed each other to a man.\n\n47. A new island appeared in the Aegean sea.\n\n48. On enquiry, there was found to be 1,544,000 citizens in Rome.\n\n70. After Jerusalem was taken, Fle•• defended a strong fortress with 960 of his most desperate fol∣lowers. When the battering ram had made a breach, they turned their swords against their wives and chil∣dren, and then against their own breasts. They died to the last man.\n\n74. On examination, several persons at Rome were found to be 100, 120, 130, 131, 1••2, 138, and 140 years old, and two were advanced to 150.\n\n195. About this time, Plautianus, the favourite minister of Severus, emperor of Rome, that his daughter, in her marriage with the oldest son of the emperor, might be attended with a train of eunuch••, worthy of an Eastern queen, ordered 100 free Romans, some of them married and fathers of families, to be castrated.\n\n200. About this period, it was the universal opinion both of the church and the heretics, that the fallen angels, or daemons, were the authors, the pa∣trons, and the objects of idolatry.\n\n291. There was a darkness at Rome at noon day.\n\n389. At Rome, a pillar of fire was seen in the air during 30 days.\n\n424. The Persian army, fearing they should be cut off by the Romans, threw themselves into the Euphrates, where upwards of 100,000 perished.\n\n770. Constantine IV. sent for a great number of friars and nuns to Ephesus, ordered them to change their black habits for white, and to destroy their\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nimages; and, on their refusal, he commanded their eyes to be put out, banished them, and sold their monasteries.\n\n800. About this time, Charlemagne, emperor of Rome and Germany, instituted the ceremony at Easter, of a Christian's giving a Jew a box on the ear, which was afterwards carried to that excess, as to destroy the Jew by the blow. This custom, about the beginning of the 12th century, was changed into a tax, and appropriated to the canons of St. Sernin.\n\n996. Otho III. emperor of Germany, having be∣headed an Italian count, on a false accusation of his empress, that he had made an attempt upon her honour, ordered her to be burnt alive, and condemned himself in a great fine, which he paid to the count's widow.\n\n998. Kyrie-cle•• and Paralipomenon were accounted two eminent saints of the church, and he who could read Greek passed for a sorcerer.\n\n1057. The custom for the lord to lie the first night with the bride of his tenant, was very common in Scotland and the North of England; but it was ab∣rogated by Malcolm III. at the instance of his queen, and a mark was paid to the lord in lieu of it. This custom was called Marcheta. The maiden rents paid at Builth, in Radnorshire, are of the same kind. It was common in France, 1280.\n\n1113. The water of the river Medway failed so much, that the smallest boats could not float in the channel: also, the Thames was so low, between the Tower and the bridge, that women and children waded it over; owing to so great an ebb in the ocean, that laid the sands bare several miles from the shore, which continued a whole day.\n\n1114. During this year, several bridges in Eng∣land, being then of timber, were broken down by the ice, when it thawed, after a severe frost.\n\n1120. One hundred and fifty nobles and the king's son lost at sea, in coming from Normandy.\n\ndescription Page 4\n\n1140. In the civil wars in Germany, when the emperor Conrade had besieged the town of Weins∣berg, the wife of Guelpho, duke of Bavaria, solicited, as an article of capitulation, a safe conduct to her and the other women in the town; which being complied with, each woman took her husband on her back, and so marched out of the place; the emperor was so pleased with the thought, that he entertained them splendidly about his tent.\n\n1160. Thirty German heretics came to England, to propagate their opinions. They said they were Christians, but denied baptism, the Lord's supper, and matrimony; for which they were condemned by a council of bishops at Oxford, and delivered over to the secular arm. Accordingly, they were marked in the forehead with a red-hot iron, whipped and thrust out of doors naked, in the midst of winter, where, none daring to relieve them, an order having been published to the contrary, they died of hunger and cold.\n\n1179. At Christmas, at a place called Oxen-hall, near Darlington, in the bishopric of Durham, the earth raised itself up like a lofty tower, and remained several hours in that posture; on a sudden, it sunk down again, with a horrid noise, and the earth so sucked it in, that it made there a deep pit, which continues to this day. Mr. Camden supposes it to be the wells that are now called Hell-kettles.\n\n1189. The emperor of Germany, the kings of England, France, and Flanders, and vast numbers of all ranks of people took the cross, and ran in shoals to the Holy Land. Another expedition took place in 1204, under the comte de Montfort, when the utmost barbarities were practised: 30,000 heretics, inhabitants of Beziers, were put to the sword; after the taking of Lavaur, the survivors were thrown into the jakes of that city, the throats of 80 gentlemen were cut in cold blood, and 400 heretics were committed to the flames, while the clergy chaunted the hymn to the Holy Ghost.\n\ndescription Page 5\n\n1201. The custom of ringing a bell before the sacrament, when carried to the sick, that all who heard might bow themselves, instituted.\n\n1250. So great and so extravavant was the osten∣tation of the French nobility about this time, that when Raymond V. count of Tholouse, held a full court, in order to reconcile two contending powers; the environs of the castle were ploughed and sewed with silver deniers, to the amount of 7500l. of the present sterling money; victuals were dressed by wax lights, and Raymond de Venons caused 30 of his horses to be burnt before the assembly.\n\n1262. The two companies of goldsmiths and tay∣lors of London fought, and several were killed on both sides. The sheriffs appeased the tumult, and thirteen of the most mutinous of them were hanged, as were thirty citizens of Norwich, for quarrel∣ling and fighting with the monks of that city. See Justs.\n\n1267. The king's half brother killed a chief justice in Westminster-hall.\n\n1293. October 14. Baliol, king of Scotland, ap∣peared in Westminster-hall, in person, by summons, to answer a complaint against him, of the earl of Fife, where he pleaded his own cause.\n\n1300. About this time, there was not an absolute prince in Europe.\n\n1309. Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of the king of Bohemia, promised in marriage to the emperor of Germany's son, but whose marriage was delayed, owing to some suspicion of her virginity, came to the Diet at Spire, and there presented herself to the emperor, &c. undressed to her shift, and in a noble speech, offered to undergo an examination by any midwives or matrons his majesty should appoint; insisting on having her innocence cleared. Such an examination took place; the report was, she was innocent, and she was immediately married in the presence of the whole diet.\n\n1315. Perpetual rains and cold weather having not only destroyed the harvest, but produced a mortality\n\ndescription Page 6\n\namong the cattle, the parliament endeavoured to moderate the prices of provisions. The rates estab∣lished were, of our present money, as follows: for the best ox not corn fed, 2l. 8s. corn fed, 3l. 12s. a fat hog two years old, 10s. a fat wether unshorn, 5s. shorn, 3s. 6d. a fat goose, 7½d. fat capon, 6d. Hen, 3d. two chickens, 3d. four pidgeons, 3d. and twenty-four eggs, 3d.\n\n1327. Raw skins of cattle, suspended on stakes, were made use of, instead of kettles, to boil meat, in the North of England and in Scotland.\n\n1330. The rains were so violent, that the harvest did not begin till Michaelmas. At Christmas, a westerly wind overthrew several houses and public edifices, tore up trees by the roots, and did a vast deal of mischief.\n\n1338. It rained almost continually, from the be∣ginning of October to the beginning of December, and then came a frost upon it, which lasted twelve weeks; yet, though the corn was destroyed by it in a great measure, the war with Scotland made money so scarce, that all sorts of grain were sold at a reason∣able rate.\n\n1340. There were 30,000 students in the university of Oxford.\n\nParliamentary grants to the king were in kind: this year 30,000 sacks of wool were in the grant.\n\n1348. It rained from Midsummer to Christmas, so that there was not one day or night dry together. This wet season caused great floods, and a pestilence, which raged a whole year. The earth was at the same time barren, and even the sea did not produce such plenty of fish as formerly. The mortality was so great, that in the city of London two hundred bodies were buried every day in the Charter-house-yard, be∣sides those interred in other common burying places: this lasted from Candlemas to Easter.\n\n1351. The parliament joined the king in resisting papal encroachments, from motives of interest; thus securing their own presentations to benefices, when\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nthey happened to be in lay hands. This sewed the seeds of freedom and independency in the church, and prepared the mind for the Reformation.\n\n1353, was remarkable for the scarcity of corn and provisions in England and France, occasioned by a great drought. It was called the dear summer; rye was brought out of Zealand to support the poor, who otherwise must have perished for want of sustenance.\n\n1364. April 8, died at the Savoy, London, John, king of France.\n\n1371. February 22, died at London, David, king of Scotland.\n\n1380. About this time, in France there was a mode of emblazoning apparel. The women wore their husbands' shields on the right side of their gowns, and their own on the left. This fashion lasted near a century.\n\n1381. When Richard IId's first wife came from Bohemia, she had no sooner set foot on shore, than such a tempest immediately arose, as had not been seen in many years. Several ships were dashed in pieces in the harbour, and the ship in which the queen came over, was shattered and broken; which was the more observable, because his second wife brought a storm with her to the English coasts, in which the king's baggage was lost, and many ships of his fleet cast away.\n\n1392. A dolphin was taken near London-bridge ten feet long.\n\n1407. Assassinations so much prevailed among the French and Scots, that the duke of Orleans, only brother of the king of France, was murdered publicly in the streets of Paris, and an eminent lawyer was allowed to plead in behalf of it, before the peers of France, and maintain the lawfulness of assassination. See anno 1414 below; Orleans, Duke of.\n\n1414. It required all the eloquence and authority of the famous Gerson to prevail on the council of Constance to condemn this proposition,\n\nThat there are some cases, in which assassination is a virtue more meritorious in a knight than in an esquire,\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nand more meritorious in a king than in a knight.\n\nSee anno 1407 above.\n\n1422. In the time of Henry VI. the king's palace was surrounded with little barber's shops, which were under the direction of the barber of the household, and the clerk of the ewry. There being then no carriages, and the streets being dirty, it is probable, that those who went to court were first shaved and dressed in these stalls or shops. A considerable see is also given to this barber for shaving every knight of the bath, on his creation, as well as 40s. from every baron, 100s. from every earl, and 10l. from every duke on the like occasion.\n\n1446. There were two unusual combats within lists appointed. The first was by the prior of Kilmain, in Ireland, who impeached the earl of Ormond of high treason, and the place of trial was in Smithfield; but the quarrel was taken up by the king, and so de∣cided without combat. The second was by one John David, an armourer, who impeached his master, William Catur, of treason; but the latter being, with his neighbours, intoxicated with wine, before he came to fight, he was unhappily slain, without any just suspicion of guilt; but the servant lived not long after him; for the next assize, he was hanged for felony.\n\n1453. John Norman, mayor of London, the first that went to be sworn at Westminster-hall by water.\n\n1456. There were taken at Erith, within 12 miles of London, four wonderful fishes, viz. two whales, one sword-fish, and one called Mors Marina.\n\n1467. The people had an extravagant way of adorn∣ing their feet. They wore the beaks or peaks of their shoes so long, that they incumbered themselves in their walking, and were forced to tie them up to their knees; the fine gentlemen did theirs with chains of silver, or silver gilt, and others with laces. This ridiculous custom was in vogue ever since the year 1382, but now it was prohibited, on the forfeiture of 20s. and the pain of cursing by the clergy.\n\nThe king concluded a league with the king of Cas∣tile,\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nby which he allowed certain Cotswold sheep to be transported into Spain, where the breed so in∣creased, that their fine wool has since proved very detrimental to England.\n\n1477. June 16. George Nevil, duke of Bedford, was degraded by act of parliament, and his titles taken from him, for not having sufficient fortune to support the dignity.\n\n1479. Robert Byfield, one of the sheriffs of Lon∣don, was fined fifty pounds by the court of aldermen, for affronting the lord mayor, which it seems was only by kneeling too near him at prayers, at St. Paul's church.\n\n1486. John Percival drank to by the lord mayor for sheriff, the first time of this method of election.\n\n1492. Pope Alexander VI. who began to reign this year, divided the whole undiscovered world between the kings of Spain and Portugal.\n\n1494. The body of one Alice Hackney, which had been buried 175 years, was accidentally dug up in the church of St. Mary Hill, London; the skin was whole, and the joints of the arms pliable. See anno 1772.\n\n1505. Philip, king of Castile, in his voyage to Spain, was driven by a storm on the coast of England, where he was detained till he had seer king Henry, which he did, at Windsor.\n\n1508.
