        "text": "The previous blog post on John London has attracted some spirited discussion and comment on the complicated relationships of the Plankney family and their connections. This post attempts to pull together that discussion (and other similar discussions on various message boards over the years) and tie it to the key contemporary sources. Thanks to Nigel and Margaret for their interest and for contributing their findings and sources.\n\n​Firstly, I’ll come back to what triggered my interest in the first place: establishing the ancestry of Francis Hampton. Francis emigrated to Ireland about 1615 and was ancestor of the Hampton family of co Armagh, from whom I descend. He and many other members of the family were players in the Plantation of Ulster which commenced in 1609, facilitated by Christopher Hampton’s appointment as the Archbishop of Armagh in 1613.\n\nEven a cursory glance at Francis’s background suggests a wide-flung family history. His elder brother Christopher, Archbishop of Armagh, was born in Calais (in about 1552), and presumably the family moved back to Leicestershire after the fall of Calais to the French in 1558. They were part of a complicated web of kin, friends and business partners centred on the Merchants of the Staple – the wool trade – forming a triangle: the Midlands counties where the wool was produced, London where the Staple was headquartered, and the trading centre of Calais (and, after 1558, the Low Countries).\n\nThis post sets out what can be gleaned about the Hampton family, gives some brief sourced biographies of family members, and comments on the sources available. A later post will cover the Plankney side of the family.\n\nThere is much surviving evidence about these families, but much of that evidence is not in the convenient genealogical form of later periods. The inter-relationships between families in small tight communities with high mortality also defy simple genealogical description. People have a wealth of full siblings, half-siblings, step-siblings and in-laws all described simply as ‘brother’ or ‘sister’, and ‘cozens’ who might be cousins in the modern sense, but also might be nieces or nephews.\n\nHampton family\n\nA series of four wills enables us to piece together the descendants of Francis’s maternal grandparents with a high degree of confidence:\n\nWill of his mother Alice Hampton, widow of Frisby, Leicestershire [also known as Frisby-on-the-Wreake or Frethby], dated 3 April 1577 (Will AH)\n\nWill of Alice’s second husband Henry Suthwike or Southwicks, Merchant of the Staple at Calais, dated 30 April 1551 (Will HS)\n\nWill of Alice’s half-brother Reynold Copcot or Copcott, Ironmonger of London, dated 5 April 1598 at Middelburg, Zeeland (Will RC). It’s possible Reynold was Alice’s step-brother rather than her half-brother, but either way he was closely connected to the wider family. His will mentions numerous ‘cozens’ – where the relationship is clear from the other wills, the ‘cozens’ are half-nieces or half-nephews.\n\nWill of Alice’s son Thomas Hampton, gent of the Bishop’s Fee near the Borough of Leicester, Leicestershire, dated 16 June 1610 (Will TH)\n\nAs well as these wills, there is some correspondence that illuminates the relationships, but it is more circumstantial. The key piece is a letter from Margaret Baynham to John Johnson, dated 1 April 1545 at Calais (Letter MB: held at National Archives).\n\nThe descent below is based on those wills. Material in square brackets is drawn from the more circumstantial sources, and links to parish records are included where the entries are freely available.\n\n1 Elizabeth –– bur. 23 Sep 1591 at St Andrew Undershaft, London (Will AH: my mother Elizabeth Copcott)\n\nm.1 –– (Letter MB: refers to ‘the death of my two brethren-in-law, my sister’s husbands’)\n\nm. 2 –– PLANKNEY d. by 1 Apr 1545 (Letter MB: refers to ‘the death of my two brethren-in-law, my sister’s husbands’)\n\n1.1 Alice PLANKNEY b.c.1515-1525 = Alice HAMPTON, widow of Frethby, Leicestershire, d. 1577/78 (Will AH: she is Francis Hampton’s mother)\n\nm.1 [John] CRANT (Will HS: Alice’s first husband was a Crant; probably the John Crant who died on 1 April 1545: Letter MB)\n\n1.1.1 John CRANT or CRANTE [b. early 1540s?] (AH will: my son; HS will: my wife’s son)\n\n1.1.1.1 Thomas CRANTE (RC will: my cozen) settled in co Armagh by 1616\n\nm.2 Henry SOUTHWICK d. 1551 (Will HS: my wife Alice)\n\n1.1.2 –– SOUTHWICK b.1546-1552 (Will HS: unnamed ‘sons’, probably died childless before 1577)\n\n1.1.3 Thomas SOUTHWICK b.1546-1552 d. by 1598 (Will AH: my son; Will HS: unnamed ‘sons’; Will RC: children of my cozen Thomas Southwick, implied he is dead)\n\n1.1.3.1 Margaret SOUTHWICK (Will AH: daughter of Thomas Southwick)\n\n1.1.3.2 Henry SOUTHWICK (Will AH: listed after Margaret)\n\n1.1.3.3 Anne SOUTHWICK (Will AH: listed after Margaret)\n\n1.1.3.4 Richard SOUTHWICK (not in Will AH; resident in co Armagh in 1620; witnessed George Fairfax’s will in 1622)\n\n1.1.4 Margaret SOUTHWICK b. 1546-1552 (Will RC: my cozen Margaret Fairfax, widow\n\nm.

John BRADLEY of Lowth (Visitations)\n\nm.3 [John] HAMPTON d by 1577. His first name is not given in the wills, but he is almost certainly ‘John Hampton late of Frethby, Co Leics, alias merchant of the staple of wool, alias citizen and skinner of London’.\n\n1.1.5 Christopher HAMPTON b.c. 1552 in Calais, d. 3 Jan 1625 in Drogheda, Ireland.

Aug 1590 (Will AH: relationship not stated; could be a child of an earlier marriage of Adam)\n\n2 Margaret –– (Letter MB: sister of widow Plankney; Will HS: my aunt). She is likely to be a sister-in-law of Elizabeth through the Plankney side. Margaret’s will dated 5 Sep 1558 mentions two sisters, the children of ‘my sister Copcott’, and ‘my cosson Henry Planckney’, who inherited the bulk of her estate.\n\nm.1 –– (Letter MB: death of ‘husbands’)\n\nm.2 –– BAYNHAM (Letter MB) d. by 30 Dec 1543\n\nBiographical Notes\n\nElizabeth Copcott (#1) was buried on 23 Sep 1591 at St Andrew Undershaft, London, England.\n\nAlice Plankney (#1.1) The ages of Alice’s children suggest that she was born about 1515-1525, and probably towards the latter end of that range. She was probably still quite young when widowed for the first time, and was left in some difficulties – some Cleveners refused to pay her money they had owed her late husband, John Crant.\n\nIt seems that Alice remarried quickly after the death of both her husbands: she bore Henry Southwick at least 3 children before he wrote his will in 1551, and the best estimates have Christopher Hampton born in 1552.\n\nJohn Crant, 1st husband of Alice Plankney (#1.1) ​John was a servant to Anthony Cave, a prominent Merchant of the Staple who had moved to London by the 1540s, and he travelled throughout the Low Countries on business for Cave. John fell ill with the plague on Sunday 29 March 1545 at Mistress Baynham’s house in Calais, and died there at 11 a.m. on 1 April.\n\nJohn Crant (#1.1.1) ​Little is known about John. He was left twenty pounds in the will of his step-father Henry Southwick, who described John as his wife’s son, and he was one of the executors of the will of Alice Hampton nee Planckney in 1577.\n\nThomas Crant or Crante (#1.1.1.1) Thomas followed his uncle Christopher Hampton to Ireland by 1616. He was Chancellor of the diocese of Armagh from 1622 to 1625. He was also the Rector of Clonfeacle in co Tyrone from 1619 to about 1628-1633, and the non-resident Rector of Aghalow in co Tyrone from 1622 to about 1633. He was one of those who made a survey of the town in 1619. He and his son Thomas held various lands around Armagh, including ‘a fair stone house which cost him £350’ in Armagh town, in 1620.\n\nHenry Southwick, 2nd husband of Alice Plankney (#1.1) ​Henry (who spelled his surname Suthwyke) was a Merchant of the Staple in Calais, originally from Tettenhall (he left bequests to the poor of Tettenhall, Sutton Coldfield and Calais). He was a friend and attorney to John Johnson and is referred to frequently in the Johnson letters [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. He did business with Adam Copcott in 1544.\n\nHenry died suddenly on 18 or 19 July 1551 in Calais of the ‘sleeping sickness’ [possibly the sweating sickness?] during an outbreak that killed a number of the Merchants of the Staple (Johnson letter quoted by Winchester). His will did not list his children by name but referred to ‘sons’ and ‘daughter or daughters’.\n\nRichard Fairfax, husband of Margaret Southwick (#1.1.4) His family details, including descendants, are to be found in published Lincolnshire Pedigrees.\n\nGeorge Fairfax (#1.1.4.2) George went to Armagh, presumably in the train of his uncle Christopher Hampton, and when he wrote his will in 1622 he left properties in co Armagh and several parts of England to son Christopher, lands in co Armagh to son James, and money to daughter Mary. He mentioned ‘cozen’ Sir George Whitmore, Alderman of London, ‘brother’ Mr John Bradley of Louth (who had charge of his lands in Lincolnshire until his children were grown), ‘cozen’ Mr Robert Hawton of ?Stringham (who had charge of his lands in Suffolk), nephew Chapell (who had charge of the leased lands in Ireland), nephew George Parish, sister Bradlie, godson Richard Chapell, ‘cozin’ Crant and his wife, ‘cozin’ Southwicke, ‘cozin’ Chapell and ‘cozin’ Bradie. His family details, including descendants, are to be found in published Lincolnshire Pedigrees.\n\nJohn Hampton, 3rd husband of Alice Plankney (#1.1) ​Others have made some informed guesses as to the possible siblings of John Hampton, but these require more research to untangle with any certainty.\n\nJohn probably married Alice very soon after the death of her husband Henry Southwick in 1551. There are several mentions of a John Hampton associated with the Merchants of the Staple in Calais, and later in England, in the 1550s-1560s. These all appear to be the same man, father of Francis. Alumni Cantabrigiensis says that Christopher Hampton’s father was John Hampton, a clerk from Hampshire, but this is not supported by any contemporary evidence.\n\nJohn had a pardon in 1559 and again in 1560 for shipping wool to Bruges in contravention of the law: many pardons were granted to former Calais merchants who had to breach the restrictive trade laws of the time by selling their goods into other Continental markets.\n\nJohn was one of the parties to a grant for incorporation of the Society of Merchants of the Staple of England in 1561, as a successor to the Merchants and Society of the Staple of Calais. This is the last mention of him in public records, and he probably died well before 1577. His burial record and will have not been found.\n\nChristopher Hampton, Archbishop of Armagh (#1.1.5): see Wikipedia and the 19th century edition of the Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nWilliam Hampton (#1.1.6): The will of Reynold Copcott shows he had children, but it is not clear who they were. The best candidates are Judith, and the unnamed ‘my cosyn Tyringhams wife’ listed in William’s brother Thomas Hampton’s will. The Tyringhams were a family of Leicestershire landowners and London and Rotterdam merchants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Judith’s baptism record in 1588 says she is the daughter of Mrs. Hampton, which suggests William might have died before her baptism.\n\nThomas Hampton (#1.1.7) A list of the inhabitants of Bishop’s Fee in Leicester in 1605 includes Thomas Hampton, ‘Phizicion’, and he was one of the few residents required to pay a subsidy (tax) to the King in 1605-1606. In 1605, the Mayor of Leicester accused him of being one of the residents of Bishop’s Fee stirring up conflict with the Corporation of Leicester.\n\nThomas Hampton, gent, of Bishop’s Fee near the Borough of Leicester, Leicestershire wrote his will on 16 June 1610 (proved 13 November 1610). He asked to be buried as close as possible to his ‘dear daughter’ (Joan, who died in 1608). He left bequests of 10s to brother Christopher Hampton, Doctor of Divinity, and brother Francis Hampton. He forgave any demands on ‘my youngest brother’ Edward Hampton and left him £20, and his widow was to give Edward another £30 if she remarried. He left 10s to ‘my cosyn Tyringhams wife’ and to Judith Hampton. The rest of his estate was left to his wife, unnamed in the will, but probate was granted to Joanne Hampton.\n\nFrancis Hampton (#1.1.8) Francis probably lived in Leicestershire well into adulthood: he may be the Francis Hampton who married Mary Wentworth on 3 Jun 1601 at St Mary de Castro, Leicester (although the date would suggest this was a second marriage). Francis had settled in Ulster by December 1615, when F. Hampton and C. Hampton of Kilmore, co Armagh had a lease of lands from the Archbishop, his brother Christopher. In 1620, it was recorded that Francis Hampton and Christopher Hampton, Gents, held 10 townes in the territory of Kilmore for 60 years at a rent of £40, with a requirements to build two English-like houses, to find one light horse and man for his Majesty’s service.\n\nFrancis is probably also the father, or uncle, of John Hampton, gent, who in about 1620 held 4 townes in the territory of Toaghy for 60 years at a rent of £17, required to build one English-like house; and of Thomas Hampton, gent, who held three townes in the territory of Ardtra for 60 years at rent of £7/10/0, to find one light horse and man for his Majesty’s service.\n\nEdward Hampton (#1.1.9): His mother’s will notes that he was at university when she wrote it, so he must be the Edward Hampton who matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter 1576, took his B.A. in 1580-1 and M.A. in 1584, and was a Fellow in 1583. He was ordained a deacon and priest at Peterborough on 30 Nov 1585. He was appointed Vicar of Sedbergh, in Yorkshire, on 15 Nov 1586, and remained there until his death on 4 Oct 1610. During his time at Sedbergh, he had to contend with a previous vicar who had been removed from the post for his Puritanism but returned to preach locally; his supporters described Edward as ‘unlearned, and openly profane’. Archbishop Christopher Hampton’s will mentioned Anne Hutchiss, ‘my brother Edward’s wife’.\n\nHenry Plankney (#1.2) will be covered in a later post.\n\nAdam Copcott, 3rd husband of Elizabeth Copcott (#1) Adam was possibly the son of John Copcott, resident in Calais in the 1510s. A marriage licence was issued from the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury on 23 April 1545 for Adam Copcott & Elizabeth Planckney, widow, of Calais.\n\nHe was admitted to the Merchant Taylors in London in 1558, and had licence to ship wool to Bruges after the fall of Calais that year. In 1584-1585, Adam was keeper of the Bayhall Market for strangers in London. Bay Hall, aka Bakewell or Blackwell Hall, market was a weekly cloth market for ‘strangers’ to sell cloth, located where the Guildhall Art Gallery now stands.\n\nReynold Copcott (#1.4) In 1582, Reynold and his business partner Fernando Clutterbooke paid a subsidy in St Martin Outwich parish in London. He was a member of the Ironmongers Company in London. Also in 1582, Reynold was in Antwerp, where he was involved in English interests (directed by Francis Walsingham) in the rebellion of the United Provinces of the Netherlands against Spanish rule.\n\nBy 1585, Reynold was a merchant in Middleberg, Zeeland, where one of Walsingham’s correspondents described him as “a very honest and discreet merchant of our nation”. As well as the numerous relatives listed in his will, he left money to poor Fellows of Trinity College Cambridge and Bennet College Cambridge [Corpus Christi College], as well as to the Ironmongers Company in London for the relief of poor brethren.\n\nMary Copcott (#1.4.1) Mary was only about six when her father died. His will left her custody to her mother and five trustees, who were to pay out money from her bequest annually ‘until she be naturalized by Acte of Parlyament or by her male prerogative”. If his wife died while Mary was still a minor, her guardians were to be his ‘trusty and well beloved cozens’ Christopher and Francis Hampton. In 1603, the Privy Council sent someone to Middleberg to bring Mary back to England, but her mother’s associates resisted this, ‘lest she should come to the hands of the Hamptones, who, they alleged, are no fit guardians for the child’. She was naturalised by an Act of Parliament in 1603.\n\nMary was married at about the age of fifteen to George Whitmore of Balmes Manor in Hackney, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1631 and was knighted in 1632 (Wikipedia). George and Mary had seven children and she died at Balmes House in Hackney, London on 20 Feb 1657.\n\nJohn Copcot, Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University (#1.5): see Wikipedia entry. It is unclear whether he was Elizabeth’s son or not: his parentage is dependent on the age at which he matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity college on 16 Nov 1562.\n\nMargaret Baynham (#2) Barbara Winchester describes her as a fair widow who was “farming hundreds of acres of land in Calais, running a comfortable boarding-house for her stapler friends and trading in wool and wine and herring with the Johnsons and other merchants of her acquaintance”.\n\nSources\n\nThere are four main sources of contemporary, or near-contemporary, evidence for these families in this period:\n\nWills and (from 1538) parish registers: the links in the family table above go to index entries. The original wills can be seen by subscribers at Ancestry and The Genealogist.\n\nVisitations: these were compiled by heralds for the purpose of recording pedigrees of families that held coats of arms. The more recent family history recorded in the pedigrees compiled in the Visitations will generally be quite accurate, but older parts of the pedigree may not be.\n\nOfficial documents generated by the state: legal documents, and correspondence on official business. A wealth of material from this period is freely available online in various Calendars of State Papers and similar compilations\n\nPrivate correspondence\n\nThe most accessible collection of wills is those proved at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury: a contemporary copy of each will was made when probate was granted. More and more other wills are coming online, at least in abstract form, as the online catalogues of county record offices improve. All relevant wills available online are linked in the text.\n\nPrivate correspondence"
