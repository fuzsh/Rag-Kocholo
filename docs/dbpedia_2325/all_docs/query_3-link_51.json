        "text": "At the time of the Norman invasion the Irish church under its primate, Gilla Mac Liag or Gelasius, had welcomed the advent of Henry II and accepted his claim to be an ecclesiastical reformer. As a result the invaders, while ensuring that English or French clerics controlled the church in the areas they themselves had colonised, did not interfere with the primacy of all Ireland at Armagh. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the coarbship of Patrick was held in turn by ten primates of native Irish stock, a German, an Italian and only one Anglo-Norman, Luke Netterville, freely elected in 1217.\n\n8 Register of Primate Milo Sweteman, f. 1 ν (T.C.D. MS T/4/1, p. 19). The original registers of primates Sweteman, Fleming, Swayne, Prene, Mey and Octavian are now deposited in the Archiépiscopal Registry at Armagh and may only be viewed by arrangement with the provincial registrar, Chancellor H. W. Love. Fair copies of these registers, made by Bishop Reeves and others, are kept in the Public Library of Armagh; I have been using a set of rough transcripts made by Bishop Reeves and his amanuensis and now kept in T.C.D. Library (MSS T/4/1-11). To facilitate reference I shall be quoting the folio numbers of the original, which are noted in the margins of both sets of transcripts, followed in brackets by the page reference for the Trinity copy. The document referred to in this note is summarized by Lawlor, H.J., ‘A calendar of the register of Archbishop Sweteman’ in R.I.A. Proc., 29 (1911–12),Google Scholar sect c, pp 213–310 (hereafter cited as Cal. Sweteman), no. 8.\n\n14 Lawlor, H.J., ‘A calendar of the register of Archbishop Fleming’ in R.I.A. Proc., 30 (1912–13),Google Scholar sect, c, pp 94–190 (hereafter cited as Cal. Fleming), no. 170. I must disagree with Lawlor’s dating, however. ‘Edward King of Ireland’ mentioned in the document is not Edward II, king of England and lord of Ireland, but Edward Bruce, whose right to this title is explained in O’Neill’s Remonstrance ( Curtis, and MacDowell, , Irish historical documents 1172–1922 (London 1943), pp 45–6).Google Scholar\n\n30 Sweteman’s Register, f. 2** r (T.C.D. MS T/4/1, p. 22). On referring to the original register I found the passage containing the names of the Irish chiefs obscured beneath a strip of opaque yellow binding material, but Reeves’ transcript reads ‘Nelanus magunussa mcmaguna Tirrencium dicti Nelani germanum mcdonndyll capitaneum scoticorum in ultonia commorantium’ H.J Lawlor (Cal. Sweteman, no. 10) naturally assumed that the brothers were Niall and Terence, or Toirdhealbhach, Magennis. But these are not Magennis family names, whereas Niall Mor O’Neill did have a brother Toirdhealbhach, or Terence (mentioned A.U., 1365; Cal. Sweteman, no. 192, see also genealogy in 15th century Leabhar Donn—R.I.A. MS 23/Q/10, f. 36 r, col. b, 1. 6). Moreover the captain of the Ulster Scots is almost certainly O’Neill’s constable of the galloglas (A.U., 1365–8; Curtis, E., Richard II in Ireland, Oxford 1927, PP 87–8),Google Scholar and he is unlikely to have entered into a treaty that did not include O’Neill. Reeves, in the index to his transcript of Sweteman’s Register, takes the ‘Nellanus’ of the treaty to be 4 Nellanus Oneyll ’, probably influenced by the archbishop’s November letter; see note 31 below\n\n31 Cal. Sweteman, no. 6, where Lawlor calculates that the date ‘Monday on the vigil of S. Macutus’ means that the letter was written either on the 14 Nov. 1373 or 14 November 1379. He inclines to the later date because he knew no evidence that John Keppok was acting as justiciar as early as Nov. 1373, but this evidence is now supplied in Richardson & Sayles’, Admin., p. 91.\n\n33 Sweteman’s Register, f. 27 r (T.C.D. MS T/4/1, pp 18–34); Cal. Sweteman, no. 141. The person to whom the letter is addressed is not named, but the contents make it clear he is an Irish magnate living near Armagh city- The names of his sons, Henricus and Catholicus, identify him beyond reasonable doubt as Niall Mor O’Neill; Cu-Uladh or Catholicus is a name found also among the O’Hanlons and Magennises, but ‘Henry’ is peculiar to the O’Neills. The depravity of Henry Aimhreidh O’Neill was to earn him an enduring reputation in Ulster folklore. As a child I heard of the bad man of old, Harry Avery of Newtownstewart, years before I realised that he was a medieval O’Neill.\n\n47 Fleming’s Register, f. 34 ν (T.C.D. MS T/4/2, p. 202), where Art son of Cu-Uladh O’Neill promises in letters patent ’ volo et concedo quod dictus venerabilis pater balivas et… rrbales suos pro eisdem redditibus ad distringendum mittat sine contradictione quacunque ’— thus Reeves’ transcript. On consulting the original I found that a small brown stain had obliterated about two letters at the beginning of the defective word. The context suggests very strongly the reading ‘turrbales’. Turbales, turbaces and turbarli occur frequently throughout the registers as the Latin equivalent for ‘kerne’."
