His register, the first of its kind to survive medieval Ireland, offers remarkable insights into how the Church operated in the midst of a divided society in the middle of the fourteenth century. The register recounts Sweteman’s disputes over ecclesiastical primacy with the Archbishop of Dublin and his uneasy relations with Irish rulers such as Niall Ó Néill who threatened ‘like a pope or an emperor’ to seize all his lands in Armah, Ó hAnluain who assaulted and threatened his servants, and Mac Aonghusa who made a devastating raid into County Louth in 1374.."
