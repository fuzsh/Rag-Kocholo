        "text": "So, it’s now 27th June and I have just finished packing in preparation for our morning flight back to London via Moscow. It feels really quite odd that we are leaving. I feel happy, sad, disappointed, excited and have this sort of odd nervous feeling in my stomach.\n\nSince my last blog we have been to Yekaterinburg, written our year abroad essays, met up with some people and I took a weekend trip with Kamila to her family home in Tobolsk. The primary excuse to go to Yekaterinburg was to see one of our favourite groups, Two Door Cinema Club. The weekend was really enjoyable and the concert was definitely worth the trip. Yekaterinburg is about 5 hours from Tyumen by ‘электричка’ (a type of passenger train). This journey flew by as our last train experience had been the 50-hour trip back from Irkutsk and were greeted by glorious sunshine in Yekaterinburg. Aside from wondering around the city, which is the capital of the Urals’ and which boasts (a very small) metro system, we visited a statue of former president and notorious drunk, Yeltsin, spent an afternoon in an attraction park, visited the ‘Храм на крови’ (a large church built on the execution site of the Tsar Nicholas II and his family) and had some decent food whilst enjoying the sunshine. We even found a vaguely convincing Irish pub, which was a step up from the embarrassing ‘Greenwich’ pub in Tyumen (more of a shabby Russian bar advertised as a British pub despite the fact that it didn’t actually have any vodka, gin, guinness or most of the beers on their menu).\n\nAfter a refreshing and pleasant weekend, we came back to our rickety beds in Tyumen and with full knowledge that we really needed to start working on our year abroad essays. I decided to do a research essay on the differences in the way British and Russian youth behave and think, and how their values differ. We were told the essays were meant to be based on our own experience but also academic. This resulted in me pestering students of Tyumen and British friends to fill my ‘анкеты’ (surveys) in the appropriate language. All in all, the essay didn’t prove to be quite a burden as anticipated. Ruth and I had about 7-10 days of trudging to the library to complete the 3500-words of Russian, and although I can’t help but fear a pitiful mark, we are relieved just to have them done!\n\nLast weekend Kamila invited me to Tobolsk. Tobolsk is about a 3-hour drive from Tyumen and Kamila’s boyfriend, Marat, took us along with Kamila’s brother, Farid. Unfortunately, Ruth, Rob and I had also agreed to go to the club ‘Мираж’ with a friend the night before. We hadn’t been on a proper night out in a while so I think it’s fair to say we enjoyed ourselves a bit too much and it really was a challenge to muster up any decent Russian conversation on the Saturday morning drive to Tobolsk. We arrived to the city and were greeted by copious amounts of food, including some delicious ‘мясо по-французки’ (a cheesy potato dish with pork and tomatoes, all baked together) by Kamila’s mother. Marat, Kamila and I then went around the city and saw the city’s impressive kremlin along with a monastery and various small churches. We also went to a peculiar tourist park which was themed on the well-known Russian fairytales. The park was very pleasant and was located on a hill overlooking some beautiful countryside and large mass of water. However, the amount of mosquitoes and other large and rather terrifying winged-creatures made the experience rather less serene. Although it is often easy to forget, we have definitely been reminded that Tyumen is in the middle of the vast expanse of land that is Siberia, and with its sweltering summers (it has reached about 35 degrees celsius) come the swarms of ‘комары’ (mosquitoes) and other creepy-crawlies. Unfortunately, it also seems that these Siberian insects prefer British blood to Russian, and we have therefore suffered from many an itch whilst most of our Russian companions remain unaffected.\n\nToday we had our last lesson with Tatiana in which she characteristically spent half the time summarizing our personalities and generalizing about how British people are this and that, whilst Russians are more like this, but her Chinese students are so much more blah and blah. I have found Tatiana’s constant character analysis and largely unfounded opinions of various nationalities rather tiresome over the last few months, but undoubtedly, she has been a great teacher and has always made her best efforts to improve our Russian. Our other, younger teacher, Lena, has taken a rather more ‘relaxed’ approach to her teaching duties and has recently started texting before our 9am lessons to announce the cancellation of lessons, which she promises but fails to rearrange. Even Lena however, on the whole, has certainly helped us and we’ve definitely had some laughs during our lessons with her.\n\nOf course, the majority of our Russian learning has probably come from social get-togethers with students and various others. For me, Alina and Kamila have been especially hepful and over the last couple of weeks I have seen Alina rather a lot and she has been a good friend whilst here. We’ve rented out bikes together, gone shopping/to the cinema, been out for dinner and drinks and of course the favourite Russian pasttime of generally ‘гулять’-ing around the city! Oksana, a teacher at the university, has also been lovely and has done her best to introduce us to people and invite us to events. Oksana has even insisted on meeting us at the airport at 5am tomorrow morning to say goodbye!\n\nAlthough I’ve been looking forward to coming home a lot over the last few weeks, I definitely have enjoyed myself here overall and wouldn’t have chosen anywhere else to go for the Russian half of the year abroad. Our Russian has improved and although it will always be weaker than my Spanish, I think we all understand most of what’s said to us these days and can at least maintain a conversation (which is far more than can be said for our level when we arrived here in February). There is still so much Russian vocabulary which still leaves me completely baffled but as I say, it is a great improvement on what I knew before.\n\nAnd, of course, it goes without saying that my thanks go to Ruth, Stephen, Rob, without whom I may have gone slightly crazy, and who have made this experience so enjoyable.\n\nТюмень, до свидания. Я надеюсь, что мы увидимся ещё раз в будущем!\n\nOn 31st April we set off for a trip which we had only managed to organize and book the week before. The fact that buying the right sort of ticket from the train station proved to be a challenge alone, we were feeling rather unsure as to how well we might get along on our trip to Lake Baikal. This lake holds 20% of the World’s fresh water and is a place we were sure we wanted to visit during our time in Russia. However, anyone we told about our plans had called us crazy for attempting to do it without any Russian companions and at the time of year when it may well still be freezing cold by the exposed lake.\n\nTo our dismay, it seemed that the fears of our teachers and friends may have been justified. We left the общежитие at 22.15 to be sure to catch the last bus into the centre of town where we were planning on sitting in a 24 café until our train departed at 04.15 in the morning. However, after the охрана (security lady) at the reception took such an interest in our trip and with us, not wanting to seem rude by rushing off, we obviously missed the last bus. We then spent about an hour wondering around the streets where we live trying to catch a taxi. It seemed every time we crossed the busy roads, a taxi would turn around the corner on the opposite side. Rob eventually took the initiative, rang a taxi and having managed to progress 100m from our starting point in about an hour we were just keeping our fingers crossed for the rest of the journey.\n\nEventually, after wasting away hours in the café as planned, we headed to the station and boarded the train we would be on for that night and the next 2 to come. The journey was actually rather enjoyable as we entertained ourselves by reading (yes, Mum, I have actually been using that kindle!), chatting, looking out the window at endless dachas and countryside. The train conditions weren’t great as it was completely full and various new bodies were coming on and off throughout the journey. I tried to drink as little as possible (so as to reduce the number of toilet visits I had to make!) and there is no doubt that after days of sitting on a train of cramped, unshowered people eating pot noodle and buying smoked fish from the station platforms that the environment is less than luxurious.\n\nWe arrived in Irkutsk to be met by Hannah, a friend from Bristol who studies in Tomsk. We went for a quick (and pretty dreadful Chinese breakfast…don’t ask), stopped at the hostel to shower and dropped our bags and set out to explore the city. Irkutsk is a very pleasant Siberian city and is less modern and shiny-looking than bits of Tyumen. There were more little wooden houses and it seemed a city which was far more used to tourists as it is known as the most popular stop on the trans-siberian railway route. After an evening of wondering, we went back to the hostel to meet Phil, Abi, Sally and Ruth who are studying at another university in Tomsk. We had some drinks in the hostel and it was good to catchup on everyone’s news from the last couple of months, sharing some amusing stories and settling into the holiday mood.\n\nThe next day we checked out of the hostel and after an hour of running around Irkutsk, trying to find the bus station, we eventually found the little маршрутка to Listvyanka, the village located on the edge of the lake. The weather was beautiful and we were all taken aback by the lovely view as we emerged from the small bus and cast our eyes across the still half-frozen lake. We made our way up to the eco-hostel which was up an old, dusty lane. We spent our 2 days in Listvyanka visiting the central market, buying the traditional smoked fish ‘омуль ‘ and even going on a hovercraft across the lake. At one spot we were amazed to hear the sound of the ice across the lake loudly crackling as it melted. It was a beautiful sight as the warm sun reflected off the shards of ice and it was remarkable to see the blocks shattering into themselves at the melting process was well underway.\n\nOn the second day, we decided to experience our first Russian banya and booked up the facilities at the hostel for the evening. The idea is that you go in to the hot steam room for about 15 minutes and cold water is then thrown over you. You are then able to relax in the adjoining room for a further 10/15 minutes until you have cooled down enough to go back in. You are also traditionally beaten with reeds but (fortunately, in my opinion) the hostel owner didn’t have any available. We stayed in the banya for about 2 hours and certainly felt very relaxed afterwards.\n\nThe following day was once again spent in Irkutsk where we treated ourselves to a delicious Mexican dinner before the looming train journey back to Tyumen the next day. After the night at the hostel and a rather unsuccessful rest (thanks to the bloke snoring like a drill on the other side of our dormitory), we said goodbye to Hannah (the others had already travelled on) and boarded the train once more. Fortunately, the train was less full on the way back and we met some friendly Russians who attempted to teach us the apparently popular card game ‘дурак’ (fool). Despite, the more comfortable conditions on the train, none of us seemed to feel particularly well during the journey and we all found boredom really set in on this return leg. The novelty of the first journey seemed to have worn off and we were certainly all extremely happy to get off after the 50 hours it took to reach Tyumen.\n\nWe are starting lessons again as usual on Monday and are all frantically trying to pull together some kind of a title for the Russian essay that is due in for 7 weeks time when we will be returning to the UK. Tomorrow I am going to the Rasputin museum (80km from the city) with my friend Kamila, her brother and her friend and on Monday, Yevgenii, from the international office has asked us to some ‘broadcast’. As per usual, we have no idea what exactly this ‘broadcast’ entails but if it’s at all interesting then I’ll be sure to include it in my next entry.\n\nДо скорого!\n\nThe last few weeks have been a mish mash of many events. It is hard to remember everything we’ve been up to but I will try to recount at least some of it. We’ve continued to meet up with various new people we’ve met and have been invited to all sorts of interesting events; cultural, educational as well as just social. A few weeks ago I went on my first outing to the theatre here in Tyumen to see the musical “пули над бродвеем” (literally, ‘Bullets over Broadway’). The show was entertaining and featured a few good songs and dances. I went to this musical with 4 of the boys from one of the classes I’d taken. Since then, I have also been taken ice-skating with them and Ruth, Rob and Stephen also joined us one Saturday when we drove out to the countryside to enjoy a BBQ in light of the coming of Spring! However, typically, this was the one day that it decided to rain amongst the many of glorious sunshine we had been enjoying. Despite the showers we enjoyed some delicious ‘шашлики’ (kebabs) and chatted inside one of the many purpose-built wooden huts in the picnic complex that only we were crazy enough to have driven to on such a wet day.\n\nWe also had another opportunity to get out in to the country one evening when we were taken to a hot spring about an hour from the city. We were accompanied by various teachers from the university and Yevgenii, a member of the international office. The hot waters were lovely and it was a great experience despite the insistence from one of the members of the group that Ruth and I should learn how to float on water. As politely as we may have tried to insist that this really wasn’t necessary, the old and slightly eccentric professor was determined that he would teach us this important life skill and so Ruth and I spent a considerable amount of time simply drifting about instead of bathing in the pools!\n\nWe have also been out ‘гулять’-ing (literally just ‘wondering/walking’) with quite a few people over recent weeks. ‘гулять’ is a term literally used to mean just to walk around the city but is also a general term to mean ‘go out/hang out’. Vasya, one of the DJs from the club ‘Питон’ is the king of ‘гулять’-ing and we have got to know him, Stas and Igor quite well from this past time. During the same week when we seemed to have wondered around Tyumen for the 600th time with various people, we were paid a visit by our university professor, Elena. Elena is from Tomsk and as she was there to visit her family and check up on the students at the universities there, she travelled to Tyumen to see how we were getting on. We were treated to a slap up meal at the local Georgian restaurant and enjoyed champagne, 3 courses and of course some vodka.\n\nOne of the teachers at the university, Oksana, has also been a really significant person during our stay and is constantly inviting us to various events at which we have the opportunity to meet new people. On Saturdays we go to a discussion group which she organizes, during which we chat to various students she has invited from the university and from the art and design institute. We have started to see a lot of one girl in particular, Alina, and she is someone I really enjoy spending time with. Her and I went shoe shopping one afternoon, took a stroll around the city, went bowling and she has also has also been out with us on a couple of nights out. Much to our amusement, Alina and her friend, Rita, failed to see the appeal of our favourite, yet slightly seedy club, ‘Питон’ and kept telling us that they were ‘в шоке’ (in shock) when we ended up there one night. The following weekend therefore, they decided to show me and Ruth the sort of club they prefer, and so we went to ‘Мираж’ (Mirage). Mirage is a typical Russian nightclub in that it plays poppy Russian music and encourages nudity as the evening progresses. At around 1am the dance floor was cleared as a pole-dancer took centre stage. After this, a man came on stage to announce the start of a competition for which he required 4 men and 4 women to come up and show the audience what they would do if they were in a bedroom together. As you can imagine, this competition could only end in some rather interesting ‘moves’ and the loss of most of the competitors’ clothing. The tables had turned and Ruth and I were now the ones ‘в шоке’.\n\nBack to our more cultural amusements, we have now been to the Philharmonic Theatre three times, each time invited by Oksana. We first saw a piano recital, then a Ukrainian folk-dance show and finally the ‘студвесна’ which is an event held every Spring by the students of the Oil and Gas University. Ruth and I have also found ourselves on stage (much to our embarrassment) at the ‘Miss общежитие’ competition in which a girl on our corridor was taking part. We sat in the audience, enjoying the rather odd beauty contest between the various halls of residents of the university, when we were summoned back stage. Ruth and I were left utterly terrified as Gem explained that we were to pick out some fancy dress items and join her on stage to dance the Harlem Shake (the Youtube craze which involves dancing around frantically in any way you wish). Ruth and I, unable to see how to escape this situation, just gritted our teeth and, along with some of Gem’s other friends, we performed in front of the jeering crowd of Russian students. The evidence is here in case anyone finds this hard to believe. Yes, I am sitting in a bag, and yes, I did chose some peculiar rowing motion as my dance move.\n\nAmongst various other things which are noticeably different here, one thing which has particularly struck me is the number of married couples we’ve met who are under the age of 23. It isn’t unheard of to meet university students who are married and, having spoken to a couple of people about it, it seems that ideally one should be thinking about marriage far earlier than your average Brit. I’ve also found that, in general, the roles of women are far more clearly defined than in Britain. I wouldn’t like to generalize, but many people here do express views of women’s roles as eventually being in the home. One of our teachers, for example, is continuously asking me about what I have cooked for the boys recently, despite the fact that we have explained on numerous occasions that we share the cooking equally. This same teacher is also very quick to bring up the question of marriage and children when directing a question to us girls, whereas she will joke with the boys about their beer-drinking and clubbing antics (despite the fact that Ruth and I actually enjoy clubbing more than the boys). Men do not shake women’s hands here and, judging from the impracticality of the day-to-day outfits and footwear of many Russian women, there does seem to be an idea that women are constantly on show. None of these observations particularly bother me and I wouldn’t say I’m a feminist particularly but I do find it interesting to see that barely no attempt is made to behave as if women and men are completely equal, whereas, in the UK, great measures are taken to ensure that women are not thought to be tied down to any traditional roles.\n\nA lot seems to have happened since my last post so I thought I should probably write some of it before it completely goes from my memory! For various organizational reasons, I am still not actually teaching yet although hopefully I will start on Friday. Stephen, Rob and Ruth all teach during the weeks and do around 4 hours each. Apart from attending lessons, teaching, and doing our ‘домашнее задание’ (homework), we have spent a lot of our time over the last few weeks meeting some new people.\n\nWe were invited to have dinner with a recently graduated couple, Genadii and Nadia, at their flat along with their friend Yevgenia. We were served all sorts of traditional Russian food from blinis to borsch. The conversation flowed rather well and we felt pleased that we had managed to maintain conversation for a good 3 or 4 hours. In return, we invited them to a British afternoon tea in our accommodation the following week. We prepared cucumber sandwiches, served various biscuits and cakes, cooked some scones and introduced them to some of the typically British products we’d brought with us from home, namely PG Tips and Marmite.\n\nLast week, we were also taken to the shopping centre ‘Гудвинc’ (Goodwin’s) with some of Rob’s students. We then went to see an ice hockey match with a couple of the same girls the following Saturday, which we really enjoyed especially as it was another opportunity to practise a bit more Russian. Another afternoon was spent being shown around a few of the cities monuments (and a carpet exhibition!) by another student and we went ourselves to take a look at the snowed-over Река Тура (Tura River) and cross the Мост Влюбённых (lovers’ bridge). One evening we took a trip to the cinema to see one of the only two authentically Russian films that were being screened, ‘Что творят мужчины’ (What Men Do). Unknowingly, we bought tickets to the ‘luxury screen’ which meant bright pink, reclining armchairs with footrests and tables. Probably the most enjoyable cinema experience of my life! The film was silly and rather outrageous but fun nonetheless.\n\nWe have certainly appreciated the invitations from various students and others related to the university, although, sometimes the phone calls involved in organizing such events can leave us rather baffled! This week I received a phone call from somebody inviting us (as far as I could make out at least!) to some sort of park the next day. First of all, I thought I’d understood that we were to meet at our accommodation at 5pm. I then made out the words ‘в час’ (1 o’clock) and then finally, as this mystery caller reiterated what the plan was I heard the equivalent of ‘tomorrow……to telephone….midday….bus…your accommodation….meet’. So, we hung up and I was left utterly bemused as to the plan; should I expect a phone call at midday tomorrow? Should I ring this number back at midday so that we could establish where to meet at 5pm? Should we wait to meet her at our accommodation at midday or perhaps 5pm? Are we supposed to get on a bus somewhere and ring her when we leave our accommodation? So many unanswered questions and unfortunately, as always, the only solution was to bite the bullet and send the inevitable follow-up text essentially explaining, ‘sorry that my Russian is so dreadful that I didn’t understand most of what you just said. Would it be possible for you to confirm what the plan is, please?’. My aim is to leave Tyumen without having to send one of these embarrassing texts after every phone call.\n\nOnce, we had established when and where to meet, we met a very friendly girl the following day and taken to find some of her friends with whom we went a sort of mini animal centre. It seemed that this is a charitable centre which hosts days for disadvantaged children. It was a really good afternoon as we then sat to have tea and chatted for a few hours with those who had taken us there. We were also delighted to see that the alphabet poster of different animals that Ruth and I had bought was put to good use! The boys mocked me and Ruth for buying this ‘childish’ poster, but it seems to have finally come in handy!\n\nWe’ve also had a few fun evenings since arriving in Tyumen. One was spent with Angela, a girl who we had met a couple of weeks before. The boys didn’t fancy a night out but Ruth and I were keen and arranged to meet her at the club at 11pm. Typically, we managed to get completely lost en route and as we stood by the side of a snowy and busy road, we decided to jump in a taxi and cut our losses. Everyone had warned that we would be shamelessly ripped off as foreigners hailing taxis so we agreed to just say the address, get in and not say a word more. However, predictably, the driver did not even understand the three Russian words which made up the address we were trying to get to and when we finally managed to communicate the location (by him reading it off the back of my vocabulary notebook!), the driver then asked where we were from and what we were doing here… our attempt at pretending to be ‘Tyumenites’ had clearly (and not surprisingly) failed. He did politely however at the end of the trip try to reassure us that our Russian would improve and didn’t seem to rip us off with a final bill of 100 rubles (2 pounds).\n\nWe stepped out of the car and appeared to be in a large, rather bleak-looking housing estate. This was the address Angela had told us to meet at. Brilliant. After at least an hour spent trying to find this place, we had now been dumped in the middle of nowhere. However, to our relief, and just as we were thinking of giving up, Angela popped out of what looked like a little shed with a corrugated roof built under one of the blocks of flats. Down the steps we went in to a club that I can only best describe as sporting the ‘alternative’ and ‘run-down-yet-cool’ look. It was more like something you might expect to find in fashionable East Berlin, not Tyumen! The walls were painted in fluorescent graffiti and the ceiling was covered in vines and other jungle décor. The place wasn’t busy but we got a drink and ended up in conversation with various people who were all intrigued by the fact we were English. We were then lead in to a small, curtained-off room where there was a man sitting behind a table serving Chinese tea. Ruth and I were confused by this concept to say the least. People were enthusiastically drinking the stuff and offering us to do the same. Coming from England where people are either dancing or drinking (so that they might eventually start dancing), we were bemused by the relaxed atmosphere and didn’t believe that this could be just tea and turned down the brews offered. After a while, however, we established that this in fact genuinely was just tea. The man serving in this make-shift tearoom genuinely had a real passion for high-quality tea and so worked in various bars in the city brewing it for the customers. We met some friendly people, danced around a bit and all in all had a really fun night. To be honest though, I think any nightclub that has its very own tearoom is going to win me over!\n\nOn 8th March International Woman’s Day was celebrated with a day off work and study and is a day on which men are expected to treat their female partners and put one of those flower kiosks to good use! Stephen and Rob even got in to the spirit of the day and bought us a flower each. That evening we went out for a drink. The boys left for home and Ruth and I decided to celebrate International Women’s Day (any excuse) in the adjoining club, ‘Горький’ (Gorkii). We walked in to a room with a cheering crowd, looking up at 5 men on stage. In turn these men stripped down, danced around and shouted drunkenly out to the crowd as the attention went to their head. Eventually the humiliated selection of men departed the stage as the winner was named and Gorkii turned back into a normal club and it turned out to be a fun evening.\n\nTo round off a busy last few weeks we then met Charlie for dinner in an Uzbek restaurant. Charlie was in Tyumen last term with three other Bristol students and has now come back as he has been offered a position as a full time teacher. It was great to see him again and hear how he had found his initial stay in Tyumen.\n\nThat’s all for now…should crack on with some homework.\n\nПока!\n\nA few statistics of the trip so far:\n\nNumber of nights in Russia: 37\n\nNumber of new words written in my notebook – 584\n\nNumber of words retained – A lot less\n\nNumber of spectacular falls in the ice/snow:\n\nRuth – 2,\n\nRob – 1,\n\nLizzie – 1 (simultaneously throwing my phone across the pavement mid-conversation),\n\nStephen – 0 (so he claims)\n\nNumber of jars of Gherkins consumed: 4.5\n\nRuth, Stephen, Rob and I met at Heathrow at 5am on Tuesday 19th February. We flew via Berlin to Moscow, where we met with Hannah and Helen who were flying on to Tomsk when we would head on to Tyumen. Our days in Moscow were spent navigating our way through the metro system and trying to fit in some cultural visits. Despite never managing to leave the hostel much before 2pm, we made it to Red Square, took a walk around the famous department store ГУМ, discovered the Arbat district and went to Gorky park with its impressive ice rink. Inevitably, most of these excursions ended in warm drink pit-stops, of course including the essential visit the chain ‘Кофе-Хаус ‘(amusingly pronounced Ko-fye Ha-oo-s).\n\nOn Wednesday evening we attempted to discover Moscow’s nightlife and to start went to find a bar/café/restaurant which had been recommended in Ruth’s guidebook. After our usual trick of getting rather lost following Moscow’s confusing and often scarce street signs, we found the restaurant was full. ‘Luckily’, however, a group of young Muscovites saw our disappointment and told us to follow them to another of their favourite places. We walked down into a dark but charming bar with tables and furniture that you might expect to find in a Russian babushka’s dacha. It looked interesting and we sat down to order some food. However, our new companions weren’t here to eat, oh no, they were here to drink. As we innocently sat eating, those at the other end of the table ordered little glass jugs of vodka and our initially ‘lucky’ encounter, turned in to a rather awkward one. Conversation turned increasingly sour as one of the Russians started by making various offensive drunken comments and refused to talk to us in Russian, claiming there was no point as he could speak English better anyway. We finally managed to pin down a waitress, pay the bill and swiftly depart without even a ‘до свидания’ (goodbye) as it became clear we were not two compatible groups of people. We then headed to ‘Гогол’ (Gogol). This was a quiet but pleasant bar where we spent a good evening having some drinks and playing ‘Never Have I Ever’ – Ruth felt it was important to ‘get to know a little more about each other’ as we would all be living together for our 5 months in the Siberian unknown – as always, this game certainly succeeded in revealing any unturned stones.\n\nFriday soon came and we were finally off to the long awaited last leg of the journey to Tyumen. After arriving in the evening we were met by a mysterious man (we think his name was Yevgenii, but we are still no completely sure!) who took us to a van and who drove us to our ‘общежитие’ (our student accommodation). Having read about previous Bristol students’ experiences here, we were rather anxious as to what the conditions would be like. Apart from the fact that flushing the toilet involves some DIY plumbing we have found it comfortable and warm (if anything, too warm! NB if you come to Russia, do bring your thermals, but also be prepared to strip off as soon as you get inside – for some reason buildings are heated to a somewhat unnecessary and uncomfortable degree – you are either hot or freezing, never just warm!). Ruth and I are sharing a room consisting of two single beds, a little stove, kettle, microwave, sink and bathroom and apart from the odd bathroom leak (for which we got a rather stern talking to from the receptionist, despite the fact that the dodgy plumbing is out of our control), we have few complaints. Unfortunately, we still haven’t managed to get internet for the first week as this involves ringing up a Russian internet company. Our Mongolian neighbour has kindly offered to help us out with this but she warns ‘они работает долго’ (they take a long time!).\n\nWe’ve bought all we need from our new favourite shop ‘Саша’ – pots, pans, cutlery etc. and have even got our very own Russian mobiles each. However, it must be noted that all these tasks have been achieved with varying degrees of awkward hilarity along the way. This is not a touristic city. In fact, every day we get approached in cafes and supermarkets and asked where we’re from and why we’re here. When we explain (in our currently less than brilliant Russian) that we are here studying at the oil and gas university and we are from England, people seem pleasantly surprised and it is clear we are a novelty. Although many believe Russians to be cold, we have discovered both here, and in Moscow, that people are in fact very friendly and willing to help you and see the funny side of any (usually language-related) incident. Unfortunately I was the first to have a real blunder when we walked past a Georgian restaurant we were interested to go to on the evening of Rob’s birthday. Whilst meaning to ask if the restaurant would be open this evening (should have been, ‘открыто сегодня вечером?’), I, having forgotten most of my two years’ worth of Russian, asked ‘отлично сегодня вечера’ (literally, ‘is it excellent today of the evening?’). To this rather ridiculous question, the man whom I’d asked, looking slightly bemused, but gave me a friendly smile and simply replied ‘Да’. I was so embarrassed when the others pointed out this mistake, that I’ve decided to think a little more before opening my mouth.\n\nIn general we have tried to get to know the city by using the local bus service and, in particular, the very convenient number 54 bus which leaves from the bus stop very close to our accommodation. Today seemed to be the most extreme weather we’ve had with temperatures of well below freezing (around -16 degrees Celsius) and sharp blusters of wind which felt as though small pins of ice where shooting at your face. We have discovered the large ‘рынок’ (market) in the centre of town where I was delighted to buy my first white cabbage (those who know me and my love of cabbage well will know that this isn’t a sarcastic comment!).\n\nView from our room looking over our handy and favourite supermarket ‘Мостовский’\n\nWe have started our Russian lessons this week at the university; 4 lessons of 1.5hrs each and I would say they have been quite tricky so far. The lessons are totally in Russian and we have learnt that a good knowledge of different grammatical terms in Russian is going to be essential. I do think that with each lesson we understand more and more and I am hopeful that our Russian will improve in time.\n\nOn Tuesday we went to meet with the languages department of the university where we were given tea, coffee and cake and where we decided who would be teaching in which departments. Rob and Stephen are teaching in the main university language department, Ruth will be in another and I will be teaching in a separate university building located in the centre of the city. We all went to see where I would be working with a very welcoming lady named Oksana. Oksana showed us around this central university building and has been texting us to organize various activities. We were invited to watch Tyumen university play basketball against a Moscow team on Wednesday and a very nice woman named Olga asked what we would like to see and do during our time here so that she could organize some things. We tried to give her some ideas of what we like, Rob suggesting hockey and I expressed an interest in seeing some of the city’s music and theatre.\n\nAll in all, I think we are all feeling relatively settled in Tyumen. This region is rich in its resources of oil and gas and at first glances is not a particularly beautiful city. Having said that, this is certainly a comfortable city to live in and we have found some really nice bars, cafes and restaurants already. I am certainly pleased I chose to come here as I hope the fact that it isn’t such a large and touristic city will force us to f your comfort zone and where speaking Russian really is an essential part of everyday life.\n\nOddity of the week: Цветы (flowers) – For some bizarre reason there are a huge number of 24 hour flower shops on the streets of Moscow and Tyumen. Is there really such a demand for something so unessential? Or, are these kiosks really secret hideouts for underground crime? We strongly doubt that crime does lie behind this seemingly innocent obsession but really, who does feel the pressing urge to pick up a bunch of flowers at 4 in the morning? We hope to unravel this mystery during our time here and will of course give an update as soon as answers are found.\n\nQuote of the week:\n\nStephen Nichols – “Are sweater vests popular here?” – Stephen chose to break the silence in ‘Beer ‘n’ Blues’ Cafe’ one afternoon with this interesting and profound question."
