        "text": "A while back I had a headlight burn out so I chose the Sylvania Silverstar as my replacement - The blue package not the top of the line orange package. The product has performed as advertised including light, clarity & service life.\n\nAnd speaking of service life - Lighting is one of those things nobody thinks about until it isn't working. Like about Monday this week I noticed I had a headlight out - drivers side. Great, now I gotta go get another set because when one goes, the other is close behind. No lie that.\n\nI kept forgetting to stop and get another set of lamps - kinda like remembering the rook leaks but only when it's raining - and last night as we left to go to a show said I should just throw in the spare lamp I have in the garage but didn't.\n\nLeaving the show I started up the truck and turned on the headlight - which promptly failed. The high beams still work but the low beam filaments were toast so I drove home with no lights rather than blind everyone else in the city roads. 3 miles later, I'm home safely with no harassing interaction with other drivers.\n\nSo if you're using a respected manufacturer for lamps and they have an expected service life - expect the other lamp to go very quickly behind the first one. Do not hesitate getting your replacements.\n\nI will be getting Sylvania again, perhaps the higher end but at least the Silverstar at a minimum. I hope you find this useful.\n\nHeadlight bulbs should always be replaced in pairs. The lights dimm over time, and as you mention when 1 fails the 2nd isn’t usually far behind if the lights have strict quality control.\n\nWhat I do is keep an extra set on hand at all times. When 1 bulb fails, swap the set and save the old bulb. When the next set has a light go out, swap in the old bulb to replace the dead one in order to buy a little time to pick up a couple new sets.\n\nI also tried to use the same bulbs several months ago. I loved the extra light when driving at night, but they kept blowing out. One month the driver side would blow out and then the next month the passenger side would blow out. I went through at least 5 or 6 replacements and I was talking to the counter guy and he tells me that the older models, mine is a 2008, can't handle them and that I needed to use the lowest of the 3 levels of the Silverstar bulbs. He was right since I've gone several months with those lower bulbs. Well until this week, but that's a different problem that I will post in a new thread.\n\nSilverstars are not a performance improvement, if you look at the spec they actually produce less lumens than stock due to the coating. Many people think it is more due to the whiter color.\n\nTake another look, I posted an update in the original thread with a reduced cost option for the harness. Not a huge savings, but a savings alternative non-the-less.\n\nIve heard this alot.\n\nCant recall last place of origin of my zxe, but they are well over a year old. I think i bought 2 sets in the last 6.5 yrs and im still on that 2nd set.\n\nFew yrs of working nights included.\n\nAll i know is dont touch, dont touch, dont touch\n\nOh, and save your reciept\n\nNot sure about country of origin for Sylvania's per se. But Osram makes legit high performance silverstars from Germany which are not the same bulb as the Sylvanias.\n\nDon't touch, wear gloves. And don't start your truck with the headlights on to avoid the voltage cycling on startup. Always turn your headlights off when you turn your truck off and leave them off till after your truck is running.\n\nI used them in my Taco and my Subie before that. Subie would burn through bulbs every 3 months or so until all of a sudden it didn't. And it was all because of where the bulbs were made. I just happened to buy a pack from Germany instead of SE Asia and voila! Problem fixed. And I was thinking the whole time that Subie had some wiring/electrical issue!\n\nNever crossed my peanut to mention to others about the lights being off upon startup. Makes sense.\n\nLuckily my lights are always shutoff manually due to yrs of not having auto offs.\n\nMy fogs are always on tho."
