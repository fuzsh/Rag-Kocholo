S. Minina, doctor of geographical sciences, M. A. Petrosyants, professor, and Yu. I. Portnyagin, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, USSR Hydr~ometeorological Scientific Research Center and Institute of Ex.perimental Meteorology] [Abstract] The authors, on the basis of an analysis of the results of long-term - wind measurements by the method of radar observation of ineteor trails, endeavored to clarify the most important patterns of the wind regime at altitudes 80-100 ?an for periods of seasonal restructurings of circulation. A steidy was also made of the problem of the relationship between the characteristic times of development of seasonal restructuring processes at the altitudes of the meteor zone and in the stratosphere. It was found that the sprfng restructuring of circulati~n occurs rather consistently at different altitudes. Characteristic changea in some wind regime para~neters are observed in the middle latitudes at altitudes 80-100 km as early as March, that is, substan.tially earlier than in the corresponding lati- tude zone of the stratosphere. This is possibly associated with low atmospheric density at the altitudes of the meteor zone, and as a result, its low inertia. In - such a case the considerably earlier spring restructuring in the meteor zone oF the temperate latitudes in comparison with the stratosphere is evidence of its more rapid reaction to radiation conditions changing during the spring. In the meteor zone the transition from a stable sum~~:r regime of circulation to a winter regime is briefer and is expressed less clearly than the transition from winter to summer. In contrast to the sprina regime, the autumn restructuring of circul- ation in the meteor zone lags by almost 1 1/2 months in comparison with the stratomesospheric circulation. The process of spring restructuring of circulation . in the meteor zone is therefor~ of the greatest interest from the prognostic point of view. It can be surmised that a determination of the date of the spring re- structuring at altitudes 80-100 lan on the bas~s of data from radiometeor sta~:ions will be extremely useful ~n predicting the restructuring of stratospheric circul- ation and for further improvement in long-range weather forecasting methods.

M. Dobryshman, professor, Institute of Atmospheric Physics] ~ [Abstract] One of the features of atmospheric dynamics in the equatorial zone, where the role of nonlinear interaction and vertical movements even in the small terms of Coriolis acceleration is great, is a great diversity of possible circul- ation mechanisms. If there is a more or lesa clearly expressed zonal flow, the zonal velocity compnnent u(usually easterly in the troposphere) varies with time and coordinates more weakly than the meridional v and vertical w components. With- in the framework of zonal models, that is, with discarding of the derivatives of x(along the equator), there can be different regimes for v and w with one and the same zonal component u. Taking this into account, the author presents a qualita- tive analysis of a nonlinear system of equations describing very simple zona3. models of circulation mechanisms in the equatorial zone. It is shown that the sys- tem has two staCionary points. One; corresponding to a stationary geostrophic zon- al flow, is an unstable saddle point, whereas the second, corresponding to a sta- tionary easterly zonal flow ir the presence of the meridional velocity component, is a degenerate node. Tl'ie node is stable if fn the case of an easterly flow the meridional componen~ is directed toward the equator. This can be interpreted as ~stability of the Northeast Trades in the northern hemisphere and the Southeast ~ Trades in the southern hemisphere. These findings are compared with data collected during the GATE program. There is a good agreement between the theory and observa- tional data.

Ya. Kutsenko, Central Aerological Observatory] [Abstract] The article describes a numerical model of formation of a front and fron- tal stratiform cloud cover in the entire thickness of tihe troposphere, including the tropopause layer and the stratospheric layer ad~acent to it. The described model was _ formulated on the basis of a j oint solution of a system of nonlinear equations of motion, heat transfer equations, equations for the balance of humidity and liquid water content. It is shown that the degree of influe�zce of the phase transitions of moisture on circulatiori in Che frontal zone is dependent on atmospheric stratifica- tiorc. With a decrease in the stability of a warm air mass the frontal zone is inten- - sified. The region of increased gradients o� temperature, specific moisture content and also vorticity has a much greater vertical extent. The following explains.the influence of the heat of phase transitions on the formation and evolution of a frontal zone in dependence on atmospheric stability. As a result of temperature ad- - vection, under the influence of tHe macroscale deformational wind field there is formation of a corresponding vertical di~tribution of macroscale divergence, and ac- _ cordingly, of ascending air movemente. In addition to the macroscale wind field, a contribution to convergence at t,he lower levels of the atmosphere is also made by the boundary layer. Ascending movements lead to the appearance of a frontal cloud system with release.of the heat of condensatiion. The degree of inf luence of phase transirion processes on the characteristics of the frontal zone is dependent on at- mospheric stability. In the case of a very stably stratified warin air mass the phase transition processes exert virtually no influence on circulation in the frontal zone, forming under the influence of the macroscale velocity field. With a'decrease in at- mospheric stability the influence of release of the heat o� condensation on the dy- namics of frontal processes increasea. The ascending movements, creating a condensa- tion zone, favor the appearance of a large additional energy source. This gives rise to a secondary closed transverse circulation~which in the lower layers intensifies - the effect of the macroscale wind field, creating an additional influx of heat and specific humidity. This leads to a considerable intensification of convergence, and accordingly, the velocity of ascending movements, as a result of which the release of the heat of condensation is intensified. The increasing temperature gradient causes an increase in the pressure gradien~t and a deepening of the disturbance. As a result, the frontal zone with time becomes increasingly sharper, there is an in- crease in the rate of its formation and an increase in the nonuniformity of ineteor- ological elements in this zone. The intensification of the frontal zone will persist ~ 3 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 ~OR OFFICIAL USE ONLY until the influence of turbulence is counteracted by the influence of frontogenetic factors.

A. Ale~:seyeva-Obulchova and I. A. Petrichenko, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, USSR Hydrometeorological Scientific Research Centerj ' [Abstract] Data from visual and satellite observations of cl~uds are used extensive- ' ly in synoptic work in short-range weather forecasting as necessary information in . an examination of the thermal and humidity transformation of air massea. Despite this, observations of cloud cover are not used in a number of So~iet numerical ~ schemes for the forecasting of ineteorological elements. Certain numerical synoptic- hydrodynamic schemes are exceptions. However, in the latter data on the quantity of clouds are replaced by dew-point spreads by use of empirical expreasions The use Af this indirect method for taking cloud cover into account reduces the accurac;~ of ' the corresponding computations and this naturally has a negative effect on the fin- al results of synoptic-hydrodynamic forecasts of ineteorological elements. In order to determine the possible errors aseociated with the indirect method for taking data on the qua~itity of clouds into account fn forecasting schemes the authors carr- ied out numerical experiments for predicting air surface temperature. Among the dif- ferent types of averaging of dew-point spreads at different levels.in the atmosphere in the prediction of surface air temperature the best result was from a variant of use of the dew-point spread at the single level 850 gPa. The use of initial data on cloud cover in the ~rediction of air surface temperature during the summer gives an advantage of 11% and in winter even 4.OX in comparison with the use of the dew-pont spread at the 850-gPa level for these purposes. During the summer the accuracy in predicting air surface temperature increases considerably with the use of data on . ~ cloud cover or the dew-point spread for two observation times (0300 and 1500 hours) ' in comparison with one of these observation times. These and other data indicate ' the possibility of increasing the accuracy of short-range numerical forecasts of meteorological elements by including cloud cover in�ormation in the initial data. Under operational conditions the volume of data on cloud cover will be approximate- ly twice as great as the volume of data used in the numerical experiments and ac- cordingly it would be possible to obtain more precise results.than obtained in thi~a study.

A. Dinevich, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, Mol- davian Republic Adninistration of the Hydrometeorological Service] [Text] Abstract: Statistical observational data were used in determining the polarization character- . istics of a radar signal reflected from droplets of shower precipitation and hail. It is demon- strated that it is possible to detect hail on . the basis of depolarization of the reflected signal. On the tasis of signals detected from cumulonimbus clouds in shower, hail-threaten- ing and hail stages of development it is shown that it is possible to determine the hail-for- mation process with a reliability of 95Y 10-15 minut~s prior to the falling of hail to the ground. The collected data and the patterns es- tablished on ttieir basis were uaed in develop- ing a method for determining the danger of hail falling from clouds and modification schemes. Formulation of Problem and Volume o� Experimental Data Numerous inveatigations of convective clouds carried out in the USSR and abroad ~ applicable to the problems involved in the artificial modification of hail clouds have considerably broadened our knowledge concerning cloud physics and the pro- cesses transpiring in them [5, 6, 10, 14]. However, there is also a whole series of problems requiring further inveseigation. The most important of these is ob- taining detailed infarmation on the mechanisms of formation and growth of hail, as well as on differences in the structure of haii, hail~bearing, shower and cumulo- nimbus clouds. Such a problem is related to the fact that despite the relatively high effective- ness of antihail protection, attempts at the modification of hail clouds in many cases are fruitless. 6 FOR OFF7ClAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2047/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000404080003-6 FOR ORF7CIAL USE ONLY An analysis of cases with negative modification results indicated tha.t tt~~eir causes can be reduced to methodological and organizational-technical. The ar- ganizational-technic:al factors, despite their complexity, for the most part are - understandable and in principle ~an be eliminated. The methodological factors ~ for the most part are related to an inadequate knowledge of the structure of shower and hail clouds, which makes difficult the unambiguous determination of the degree of hail danger of clouds in an early stage in the hail-formation pro- cess and the places in the cloud where it is best to introduce artificial crys- tallization nuclei. A solution of these problems requires a deeper knowledge of the structure of clouds in diff~rent stages of their evolution. SPVeral models of cumulonimbus clouds have now been developed [S, 14, 17, and oth- - ersJ. However, despite considerable succESSes in the field of study of cumulonimbus hail clouds, there is still no final clarif ication of the problem as to the part of the cloud in which the processes of farmation, growth and �alling of hail be- gin and how they transpire. In this article we give new data on the differences in structure of shower, hail- dangerous and hail cumulonimbus clouds. In order to clarify them we used the re- sults of ordinary radar observations of these clouds in Moldavia, aupplemented by a polarization analysis of radar signals reflected from clouda [9]. Supplementing the radar data wQ used the results of investigations of fe~tures of intracloud air currents using radioactive tracers [4, 15]. These data make it possible with a great accuracy to solve the problems involved in routine detecti~n of the moment of transition of clouds from the nonnail-danger- ous stage to the hail-dangerous stage and to find the places in a cloud into which it is most desirable that a reagent be introduced. I The essence of the polarization method for tracing the evolution of Cb for the most part is reduced ta the following [18]: if the electric vector of an incident plane- ; polarized wave is parallel to one of the axes of the ellipsoid of the hydrometeor, i a dipole moment component is excited only along this Rxis and there is no cempon- ent along the axis perpendicular to the radio wave polarization plane. Accordingly, in this case the scattered wave will have the same polarization plane as the in- ' cident wave and there will be no transveraely polarized component o� the electro- magnetic field scattered by hydrometeora. II, If the ellipsoids of the hydrometeors are arbitrarily oriented relative to the ' polarization plane, a depolarized signal component also appears in the scattEred f ield . ~ In general, the scattered energy is determined by the polarization plane of the incident wave, the spatial position of the reflecting particles and the deg�r.~e of their asphericity, phase state and dielectric inhomogeneity. - In the case of a random distribution of particles in apace SPh~ ' ~ ~ ~ ; g'g~ 3 g~j _ ~ Jgc (P - b'~)~. 1,~p~~p 7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Here I~~ is the intensity of the energy scattered in the polarization plane of the incident wave, I y is the intensity of the energ~ andttera~eithe functionsrof~ellip~ to the polarization plane of the incidPnt wave, g $ ticity of a particle and its dielectric constant. At the same time it is known that cloud droplets, hailstones and raindrops di~jer considerably with respect to form and are oriented differently in space [1, Cloud droplets are spherical and their predominantly horizontal orientation in space remains characteristic for raindrops. According to the experimental data of Henry and McCormick [20J, large flattened dropa are oriented for the mos*_ part in the horizontal plane and the deviation of their vertical axis does not exceed 10- 15�. At the same time, the hailstones have a random orientation. Accordingly, the difference in the form of raindrops and liailstones, as well as anisotropy (change in density and size along the radius) of the latter hydrumeteor should differently reflect a plane-polarized wave, creating an orthogonal compon- ent. Therefore, knowing the quantitative values of the orthogonal component of the reflected radar signal for hailstones and droplets, it is possible to solve the inverse problem, that is, determine the presence df hail in clouds. ' On the basis of the data cited above, over a period of years radar stations of the ' ARS-3M and \"Uragan\" types and a polarimeter developed at the Central Aerological Observatory [19] have been used in carrying out investigations of the character~Ls- tics of hydrometeors in shower and hail clouds.

Characteristi~s of Structure of Cumulonimbus Rain and Hail Clouds and Their Evolu- tion According to Data Obtained by the PolariZation Research Method An analysis of the experimental data indicated that in all cases of the falling of hail in the vertical sections of Cb there were channels with an increased de- - polarization value Q p~-10 db, whereas among the 117 verticai sections of shower - clouds there were only 5 such cases, accompanied by heavy showers without hail.

Although with a definite orientation of an individual par- ticle the transverse component for~it may be absent, it~ general for a cloud or zone of precipitation consisting of a great number of randomly arranged par- ticles the mean depolarization value for the echo signal attains considerable levels. In the experiments which were carried out the actual place of the falling of hail dn the ground always coincided with the stirface projection of an enhanced (char- acteristic for hail) zone of depolarization in a cloud, determined using a polar- ized radar. The typical vertical sections of hail and shower clouds arF, shown in Fig. 1, where R is the distance to the radio echo, H is the altitude of the radio echo, lg z is radar reflectivity, T�C is temperature read from the radiosonde measurement closest in time; the dashed lines correspond to the lg z icolines and the solid lines correspond to depolarization isolines. Accor.ding to research data, in hail clouds with a channel of increased depolariz- - ation extending to the earth's surface there was. in almc~t all cases, falling of hail to the ground. In shower clouds of a region of increased depolarization with Q p i-10 db the falling of hail was observed in only 10% of the cases. How- - ever, these regions, being situated randomly, that is, in different parts of the cloud above the 0�C isotherm,did not undergo transition 3nto a form chdracteris- tic for hail clouds. In 5% of the cases in shower clouds there was a channel of increased depolarization which touched the earth, but hail was not forthcoming from the clouds. Thus, an analysis of the cited results of the investigations indicated that mak- ' ing joint use of the depolarization characteristics of signals reflected from the clouds and the radar reflectivity value it is possible to classify clouds as hail and shower clouds. The zone of ambiguity (that is, the Q p and lg z values at which both showers and hail can be observed) is extremely narrow and with a radar reflectivity lg z)3.2 falls in the limits from -10 to -15 db.

Then, for solving the formulated probler it was necessary: to find an adeq�ate method for predicting transition of a cloud .from a nonhail state to a hail stage not less than 10-15 minutes in advance; to find a method for routine radar determination of the region in the cloud in which the process of formation and growth of hail ~ranspires most rapidly and in- _ tensively. In order to solve these problems we used the data which we had accumulated on the evolution of the structure of cumulonimbus clouds in the course of their \"life- time.\" Experience in routine work on the modification of hail processes gives basis for speaking of the absence (with existing technical apparatus) of.criteria which at any specific moment in cloud development would make possible an unambig- uous determination of its hail danger. The radar criteria [2] adopted at the present time can only divide clouds into hail and nonhail or with a def inite 9 ~ ~'OR OFF7C[AL iJSE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/42/09: CIA-RDP82-40854R040400080003-6 FOR OFF'iC1AL USE ONLY accurricy evaluate tlie probability of their transition into a hail state.

The results of these investigations indicated that zones of increased depolarization are usually formed in clouds 10 or more minutes prior to the onset of the falling of hail. However, it is highly difficult to evaluate the dynamics of the life cycle of a cloud prior to ttie beginning of hail formation in it on the basis of the de- polarization characteristics of reflected signals. Moreover, in multicell clouds the different cells can be in different stages of development. Some of these may , be in the hail stage already, whereas others may only be developing. Accordingly, prior to the onset of hail formation in clouds, in addition to the depolarization characteristics ft is desirable that the hail danger of clouds be evaluated by the stochastic-statistical method [2, 6J.

In order to obtain the depolarization characteristics of a signal it is neces~ sary to use a radar set with the possibility for radiation of a plane horizontally polarized electromagnetic wave, reception of two orthogonal components of the re~ flected signal and discrimination on the circular-scan display screen and \"range- i altitude\" indicator of regions of isoechoes with stipulated devels of depolariza- tion and radar reflectivity exceeding the values ~ p~-10 db, lg z j 3.4 . In order to study the evolution of the depolarization structure of a cloud in the region of maximum radar reflectivity we constructed series of horizontal and ver- tical sections each 1-2 minutes. An increase in the region with radar reflectivity - lg z~ 3.4 in the zone with L~p 10 db, a decrease in its lower boundary, an in- crease in the horizontal gradient L1p with a simultaneous decrease in the vertical gradient Q p constitute a basis for assuming that the focus is hail dangerous. 11 FOR 4FF[CIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 F'OR OFFICIAL USE ONLY _ _ ~~K~ ~ NKn 110 ~o , - ~ a~ ~ o) , a) ~ = ~ , c) ~ , _ , ~ i i . r ~ ` ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ . ~ � ; / a' b ? ~ ~ ~f ' ~ ~ i I ~ ro~ . ?i ~ ' i . 10 10 IO yt !!r / , d) ~ - . - ~ ~ i ~ i~~ _ 1 ~ - i ~ dt� . .

We note that alreadq on the basis of the position of the zone Q p~-10 db, shown in Fig. 2b, with a guaranteed probability of 95~ and with an advance time of 10 minutes it is possible to conclude that there is a transition of the cloud into a hail stage. The advantage of the proposed method for determining hail danger of clouds is that it makes it possible to solve this problem with a high guaranteed probability 10- 15 minutes prior to the beginning of falling of hail to the ground. The adequacy of such an advance time for practical artif icial modification work can be demon- strated by using Fig. 3.

With these same atmospheric parameters a hailstone with a radius of 6 mm, falling from an altitude of 3 km, at the earth will have a radius r = 4 mm. If we also take into account the increase in heat transfer as a result of turbulent exchange, it can be expected that hailstones with a diameter of 1 cm falling from an altitude of 3 km will reach the earth having a diameter less than 5 mm. 13 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407/42/09: CIA-RDP82-40850R000400480003-6 - FOR OFFICiAL USE ONLY It is known that hailstones with a diameter of less than 5 mm will not inflict substantial damage on agricultural crops [10]. Accordin~ly, we will use ~ dia- - meter d= 5 mm of hailstones falling to the earth as the minimum size of danger- ous hail. As stated above, at an altitude of 3 lan these hailsrones have a c~ia~ mete~ d= 1 cm. According to the G. S. Bartishvili curve, such hailstones are aspherical and the ratio of the axes of the droplets freezing in their nucleu~ can exceed 0.3-0.4. With a random spatial orientation of these freezing droplets - and assuming correctness r~f the wet growth hypothesis, using computations and the A. B. Shupyatskiy curve, taken from [9] and shown in Fig. 3c, it can be dem- onstrated that the depolarization coefficient for the reflected signal is M= 15-17%, where M= P,l /P I~ , whictt corresponds to Q p~-10 db. According to this same curve, the minimum ratios of the axes of ellipsoidal particles, for which L`,,p remains greater than -10 db, is approximately equal to 0.7, which according to Fig. 3a corresponds to a hail diameter d= 4 mm. It follows from these approx- imate computations that in a cloud it i~ sufficient for there to be hailstones , with a radius greater than 2 mm and by means of polarization techniques and the developed method it is possible to detect them and proceed to modification with- out awaiting an increase in the hailstones to dangerous sizes (d~ 10 mm). Using information on cloud structure, employing data on the depolarization of re- flected signals it is possible to determine the region of formation and growth of hail, and on the basis of the results of the investigations cited in [3, 6, 8], select the optimum scheme for introduc~ng the reagent tn order to prevent large hail. The generalized schemes for introducing the reagent can be represented in the fol- lowing way: 1. With the discovery of individual small foci in a cloud in the region of the i5otherws -10,..., -15�C with the value ~p ~-10 db the reagent must be intro- duced at the level of the isotherms -4,..., -6�C in the entire region described by the isoline lg z~ 3.4. 2. If the zone of increased depolarization is situated in the leading or central part of the cloud lg z> 3.4, and its lower boundary has reached the level of the isotherm 0�C and continues to drop, the reagent must be introduced directly into this region, at the level of the isotherms -10,..., -15�C, closer to the level of the maximum rate of the ascending flow. The lower the lower boundary of the re- - gion Q p>- 10 db drops down, the more important it is to introduce the reagent under the level of the maximum velocity of the ascending flow, determined as the level of maximum radar reflectivity. 3. If the zone of increased depolarization takes in the entire region lg z) 3.4, including its rear part, and reaches the ground level, it is not necessary to introduce reagent into such a cell, since hail is already falling from it and the hail formation process ceases. - In this case it is very important to note the formation of new cells near the decaying cell. These new cells are usually formed in a leading part of the cloud (relative to the direction of movement), but sometimes they can develop in the rear. If such cells, described by the isoline lg z~ 3.4 appear, and especially at the level of the isotherms -10,,...,-15�, the reagent must be introduced 14 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 FOR OFFICiAL USE ONLY directly into them, without awaiting the appearance of regions of increased de- ~ polarization.

Independent observational data were used in checking the success of the forecasts for various Moscow airports. On the average estimates of the forpcasts were at the level Q= 0.60, where Q= 1-OC- O(.and ~ are errors of the first and second kinds. A ma~or aeries of observations has now ~ made it possible to separate the sample data into three groups, rather than into two ~ groups, as in the earlier study: No 1-- January, November, December, No 2-- Feb- ' ruary, October, No 3-- March, April, May, September. The number of the group is in ~ essence a com ~nent of the vector- redictor. The other co onents used are: uantit i P P ~P Q Y of clouds in tenths in the form of two gradations N< 5 and N~ 5, where N is the mean total quantity of clouds during the period from 1800 to 0600 hours; dew-point spread Qlg at 1800 hours; averaged wind velocity V22 = 0.8 V22 + 0.16 V20 + 0.04 Vlg, V20, V22 are the wind velocities at the height of the vane. The alternative f.orecast of _ fog is made using the discriminant analysis method. The analysis shows that the pro- posed method has a clearly expressed regional character; for example, the graphs con- structed for Moscow cannat be used for Khar'kov and Minsk. At present the methods e~ ployed in predicting fogs are based on initial data for evening observatio:ls. It is important to have a method making it poseible to predict fog formation on the basis of initial data obtained at eaxlier observation times. This problem is so11�ed. It was found that the series of hourly meteorological observations necessary for construct- - ing the discriminant functions graphs should be approximately 15 years. As a first approximation it is possible to uae a s~mple of a lesser volume: 5- and 10-year ser- ies, combining groups Nos 1 and 2. Thia and other simplifications iessen the qualit~ of the forecasts by 10-15%. The necessaxy accuracy in measuring air temperature must i be 0.1�C. The area for which the forecast is valid is dependent on the physiographic i character of the region. It must be determined experimentally.

P. Polkhov and F. S. Terziyev, candidates of geographical sciences, Murmansk Affiliate, Arctic and Antarctic Scientific Research Institute, and State Oceanographic Institute] ; a t The author proposes a new approach to the prediction of ~vaporation i [Abstr c ] fogs based on the use of asynchronous correlations between the effect (the meteor- ological phenomenon) and its cause (thermodynamic state of the atmosphere). As the , initial data for the forecast this makes it possible to use data t~ken from actual weather maps characterizing the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere (synoptic situation) on the eve of the considered phenomenon. Quadratic discriminant analysis is used as the mathematical approach. The investigated region was the northern coast of the Kola Peninsula, where during the cold half of the year (October- March) evaporation fogs are formed rather frequently. The study was based on the , meteorolagical archives of the 65 ands1975m1979tintthe form ofHsurfaceeandlhighal Service for the periods 1960-19 altitude weather charts and also TM-1 meteorological tables. In the formulated problem synoptic situations are divided into two classes: class of fog-forming sit� uations and class of non-fog-forming situations. In turn, there are subclasses: a subclass of situations causing a strong fog with a horizontal visibility < 50 m; a subclass of situations causing moderate or weak fogs with horizontal visibilities ~ S00-SO m and ~ 1000-SUO m. Such a forecast, involving preparation of initial in- formation, its input into ~he computer, forecast and printout, is completely auto~ - mated and requires 5 minutes. This fog forecasting scheme provides for operations similar to those performed by a weatherman. The weatherman, like the \"decision - rule\" derived in this study, analyzes the initial and future synoptic situations, scrutinizing the actual and predicted information for the fields P, H850, H500~ , ~ Tsurf' T850 in order to draw a cc~nclusion concerning the possibility of develop- r,ient of an evaporation fog. However, the possibilities of the weatherman are more limited because he is unable to make an objective evaluation of the enormous vol- ~ime of data handled by the computer.

Khain, candidate of physical and mathematical aciences, USSR Hy- ~ drometeorological Scientific Research Center] ~ ~ [Abstract] A study was made of the reaction of a model tropical cyclone to a change in surface roughness. The model was based on the solution of primitive equations in z-coordinates. It includes a parameterizatian of convective and macroscale precip- itation, convective transport of heat and moisture and parameterization of the I boundary layer. Macroscale precipitation falls when the mixing ratio at the points , of intersection of the finite-difference grid exceeds a saturating value. The mois-. ~ ture excess is condensed and form~ macroscale precipitation. Convective precipita- � tion is caused by condensation in cumulus clouds. Boundary layer parameterization = was carried out by the Deardorff inethod, whose suitability for the conditions of a tropical cyclone has been confirmed. The method makes it possible, using the mean values of potential temperature, mixing ratio, velocity in the mixing layer, its ~ height, surface temperature and roughness parameter to determine the fluxes of hest, moisture and momentum at the surface. It was found that the principal reason for attenuation of the model cyclone was a lim9.tation of evaporation from the land sur- face. Attex~uation of a tropical cyclone (TC) occurs when the moisture flows from the land surface do not exceed the moisture flows from the ocean surface which pre- vailed in the TC zone prior to ita movement onto land. The attenuation of the TC occurs the more rapidly the lesser the quantity of evaporation from the land sur- face. Without a limitation on evaporation an increase in rougi�aness leads to an in- crease in the flows of heat and moisture~ an increase in the convergence of mois- ture into the eye of the TC, and thus, an intensification of the TC. At the time of movement of the TC onto the land there is a brief increase in precipitation as a result of moisture convergence in the lower troposphere. In the first few hours after the TC moves onto the land the eye of the TC disappears and ascending move- ments develop at the center of the TC. With movement of the 1C onto the land the radius of the maximum winds somewhat increases. An increase in pressure, decrease in integral moisture flows and attenuation of the TC begin when the land occupies the central zone under the TC. The ~entral region therefore plays a decisive role in the attenuation of the TC over the land..Figures 6; references 13: 3 Russia~, 10 Western. 19 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-04850R000400080003-6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY UDC 551.521.1 ALLOWANCE FOR HEhT RECEIPTS FROM SOLAR RADIATION ON SLANT SURFACES Moscow METEOROLOGIYA I GIDROLOGIYA in Russian No 9, Sep 81 (manuscript received 2 Dec 80) pp 7~5-78 [Article by V. A. Pataleyev, Far Eastern Scientif ic Research Institute of Hydro- engineering and Land Improvement] [Abstract] In connection with construction of the Baykal-Amur Railroad and the in- creased volume of construction in the northeastern part of the country a precise allowanc~ for the solar radiation balance on slopes is becoming especially impor- tant. Radiation computations are also necessary for determining photosynthetical- ly active radiation used by the plant cover in the photosynthesis process, that is, in evaluating the suitability of the territory for cultivation of agricultural crops, since in the northern regions the southern slopes, in contrast to a hor- izontal surface, often receive the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation necessary for the harvesting of stable yields. The author therefore has developed a method suitable for practical application which makes it possible to ascertain the quantity of heat from solar radiation incident on slant surfaces. The basis for the method is a generally accepted expression for the radiation balance of a slope which by means of the heat transfer coefficient and the temperature compon- ents for the slant surface is transformed into a linear algebraic equation with - an unknown value of heating due to the effect of nolar radiation. The solution of ~ this equation is a formula making it possible to campute the receipts of solar en- ergy on the slant surfaces of artificial structures.

The matter of validating methods for hydroengineering work is assuming a timely importance in connection with the exploitation of mineral resources in the shelf zones of USSR seas. The results of such engineering field work are necessary both for the designing of petroleum and gas atructures and in supporting construction I and diving work and measures for preserving the environment. Waves and currents ; are the most important hydrological factora for technical work on the shelt. Due ' to the lack of reliable computation methods for studying the characteristics of currents, the principal method in specifi~ sectors �s in situ measurements. The problem of choosing the optimum distance between atations for observing cur- rents is the most difficult in the planning of hydrological field work in the coastal zone of the shelf. This zone is characterized by an extremely differen- tiated and complex pattern of circulation of water masses with considerable spatial and temporal variability. A statistical analysis of the spatial characteristics of currents in characteristic polygons is the most acceptable method for validating the optimum distance between stations. 21 FOR OFFIC[AL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY At the present time the State Oceanographic Institute [4-6], on the basis of aer-~ ial photographic survey work for the measuremer_t of currents by means of dyes,has discovered some statistical patterns of change in c.urrent velocity in regions with straight shorelines far from capes and bays in the absence of islands and banka. In particular, in the coastal zone (up to 4 km from the shore) it is recommended } that observation.points be placed at an interval of 2 km in order to obtain a syn chronous pattern of distribution of currents [4]. Directly near capes it is common to discover small circulatory systems (with a scale of about 10 km) [5]. These recommendations and conclusiflns were based on a correlation analysis of abso- lute current velocity values [4] without allowance for change in current direction. Such an approach is legitimate when determining absolute current velocities but the mathematical approach employed by the authors does not make it possible to evaluate the variability of current directions. Other methods are also known for evaluating the correlation and spectral character- istics of the current fields [7]. For example, in [1], for evaluating the spatial variability of the vector field the authore propose that the cosine of the angle between the v~ctors ~1 and ~2 be used as the parameter of degree of correlation. However, this p rameter determines only the degree of variability of the directions of the vectors ~1 and ~2 and does not take into account the variability of the ab- solute values. Accordingly, for obtaining more generalized characteristics of var- iability of the vector field it is desirable to carry out processing of the para- meters of currents not separately by components (direction, absolute value or two projections), but on the basis of the total velocity vectors. In this article we examine one of the possible variants of this evaluation and the ~ first results of its testing in specific polygons. The linear variability of the current was determined by evaluating the correlations between two time series of observations carried out at two stations situated at different distances L~ L from one another. An evaluation of the spatial variability of currents was made by find- ing the correlations for all possible pairs of stations. , The basis for the method is an analysis of random vectors represented in complex form [2J. This makes it possible, using one complex correlation coefficient, to express the degree of interrelationship between current direction and velocity. The current vector can be represented in complex form as j/~ _�~i cos a! + lvi stn ai, where vi is the absolute value of the current vector, ~i is current direction. The correlation moment of the two complex variables V1 and V2 is represented as 1~.. = K.t~ x: f~y~ y~ l(1l~yi x~'' /(x~ y~)~ ' (1) V1V1 ' _ where ~Yi - vi Cos a~; Y~ = v~ sln a~~ x~ ='~s ~os rZ; Y: = v~ sin a=, , and KXlXz , Ky y2, Kylx2, KXly2 are the correlation moments of the values (xlx2), (Yly2>, (YlY2~, (YlX2), (X1Y2). , 22 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 FOR OFF7CIAL U5E ONLY The dispersion of the complex value is determined as D~ = Da~~ + Dvl~ D Dx, Dy~ (2) ~ ~ Expanding formula (1) by parts, we obtain [cp = mean] ~ _ ~ v,i u.i cos (z~t - a:t)1 ~ ' ~ K.r, X, k y~ y1- r_t rt � - I Vicp I I Vup I COS (at~p - azcp). . ~ : rt . . . � ~ vu ~:t sin (a~t - s~~) . ~ � . ` ~ K>~~ - K.?~ y_= j_ t n - ~~l~cp I I I~Z~P ~ sin (a~~N - a=~P), where ~~i meanl is the modulus of the mean current vector, ~i mean is the mean cur- rent direction.

The method presented above was tested in the coastal zone of the Sea of Japan. l~s the experimental polygons we selected two morphologically d~.fferent parts of the shelf. The first sector (Southern Primor'ye) is characterized by a complex configur- ation of the shore (Fig. 1), whereas the second sector (southwestern coast of Sakh- alin) is characterized by a straight shore. In evaluating the spatial variability of currents in the first sector we used the method of a survey of currents at fixed points situated at different distances from one another. We used: a) squares with sides 250, 500 and 1000 m~(the surveys were made at the corners and centers of the squares); b) profiles perpendicular to - the shoreline, the distances between which were 250~ 500, 1000 and 2000 m(on each profile there were three measurement points: at depths 10, 20 and 30 m). The total ' number of ineasurement points for variant (a) was 11, and for variant (b) 18. It was impossible to set out the appropriate number of automatically recording in- struments. Accordingly, we used the method of single depth measurements at fixed points with the VI~I current meter. The network of profiles or squares was broken down by means of theodolite tie-~n with the shore. A high-speed boat was used in making the measurements. The full cycle for surveying one square (with depth meas- , urements at each of five points) required from 2 to 2.5 hours. It was assumed that ~ during this period the general pattern of currents does not essentially change and ; the collected data can be interpreted approximately as the results of a simultan- eous survey. . ; � R OQ ~ ` � � , - - 0 90 %i ' y~ 00 ~ ~ ; ~ ~ fs ~ � t �oo ~ , . 2 � ? . 0,4 oo , o~ . . . . .

The distances between profiles were 10 km, and between points on the pro- f ile up to 4 lan. ~ - The results of processing of the series of observations of currents for three squares for the sector shown in Fig. 1 are represented in Figures 2 and 3. The moduli of the complex correlation coefficients vary in the range 0.16-0.72 and the corresponding values of their argument ~ vary from 10 to 80�. The series of observations of currents at points situated not more than 200 m from one another are most closely currelated. The correlation coefficient modulus is 0.6 for this same distance. Its variation characteristic does not exceed 2%. ~ Figure 2 also shows the results of processing of current measurements along six profiles (variaiit (b)). With an increase in the distance d L between profiles the modulus of the correlation coefficient R decreases and at a distance greater than 2 km attains 0.1-0.15. With such distances between observation stations it is impossible to determine the presence of an interrelationship between individual points of the current field, that is, discriminate zones with a traneport of water masses which is sustained in direction. Using the curve of the dependence of the correlation coefficient modulus R on dis- tance L~L, similar to the graph shown in Fig. 2, and expression (4), it is possible i to select the optimum distance betwePn stations in accordance with the required ; accuracy and engineering prob'lem. For example, in the considered sector in the case -I of large-scale reconnaissance work in order to determine positions on the plan o~ - circulatory movements of water masses the distance between adjacent stations must ~ not exceed 200-300 m. On the other hand, when it is necessary to clarify the qual- i itative picture of the field of currents, that is, to determine the general direc- tion of transport of water masses (the standard deviation of current direction is ~ about �60�), it is possible to hold the interval between stations in the range 600-700 m. In this same sector, using the R value, it is possible to discriminate characteris- tic zones of interrelated movement of bottom water masses (circulation, eddies, stationary currents). Two such zones are located in the region of capes (Fig. 1) j and are evidently determined by the influence of the shoreline. A third zone; sit- il uated in a seaward direction, is in a region ad~acent to the stationary Primor'ye ~ Current. ~ i ' The spatial and alongshore variability of currents in the second sector (Sakhalin = Island) differs considerably from the variability of the coastal zone of Southern Primor'ye and is characterized by a transport of water masses which is susta:Lned over the entire polygon. The correlation coefficient modulus R is not below 0.6 with a distance between measurement points up to 30-40 km. - In addition to the proce~sing of results by the method described above, in order to determine the reciprocal influence of the entire group of ineasurement points we carried out processing of observations using the multiple correlation approach [3].

A. Yelshin, Murmansk Territorial Adminiatration of Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring] [Abstract] Until now proper attention has not been given to the heat runoff in rivers. In the territory of the USSR the heat runoff characteristics have not been determined and have not been published, nor are there any special studies . in this field. During 1979-1980 the author made computations of heat runoff in all the studied rivers of the Kola Peninsula and many rivers in Karelia, Arkhan- gel'skaya, Vologodskaya Oblasts and the Komi ASSR, rivers of the Baltic SPa hasin and a number of rivers in the lower Volga region, Moldavia and Western Ukraine. For rivers in the White Sea basin, in addition to for individual rivers, the total heat runoff was computed for consolidated regions (Kola Peninsula, Karelia, Sever- nyy Kray) and for the basin as a whole. The total heat runoff for Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga was also determined..Heat runoff was computed for 248 hydrological posts on rivers with a little-impaired regime ha~ing long (more than 10 years) observation series. It was possible to ascertain the dependence of the mean long- term heat runoff and the influence exerted on the heat runoff by a series of fac- tors; a formula is derived for computing the heat runoff; methods are given for computing the long-term variability and intraannual distribution of the heat run- - off of rivers. The dependence of the mean seasonal water temperature of rivers on their volume is established.

Ge Inishev, Tomsk State University] [Abstract] In this article, in the example of the Chulym River basin, the author develops a method for computing the high-water hydrograph. The method is ba~~d on an evaluation of lateral inflow on the basis of observations of water discharges and tiie transformation of lateral inflow into the discharge at the lowest-lying gaging station with the use of a probabilistic interpretation of travel zime. For- mulas are d~erived for the travel time distribution moments which are convenient for use with an electronic computer. Other formulas are proposed for the lateral inflow probability density function along the length of the stream, taking into account the peculiarities of structure of the channel network, on the basis of which ex- pressions are obtained for the travel time moments. The degree of detail consider- ed for different parts of a basin is determined by the uniformity of the conditions _ for the formation of runoff and the pattern of the hydrographic net. The greater the detail for the parts of the basin (segments of the channel network), the more complete is the allowance for the peculiarities of the channel net. However, if only a limited volume o� information is available for the basin as a whole, it makes no sense to break the basin down into any detailed scheme. Thus, for each river basin an individual judgment must be made concerning the detail of basin breakdown. The solution of this problem for the Chulym River, which has mountain- ous, hilly and lowland reaches, is discussed. A model for computing the hydrograph of spring high water is formulated on the basis of the total inflow of water into the channel network with the use of the derived expressions. The validity of the formulas was checked on the basis of data for 12 high-water periods (1962-1973). There was found to be a satisfactory agreement between the computed and actual high-water hydrographs. The same parameters of the model can be used in years with different water discharge.

A. Burkov, doctor of geographical sciences, A. B. Zubin and V. B. Titov, candidates of geographical sciences, and A. I. Kharlamov, Institute of Oceanology, USSR Academy of Sciences] [Abstract] In 1979, during the FGGE, the Institute of Oceanology and its divisions carried out extensive hydrophysical measurements in an Atlantic equatorial polygon. ihe basic ob~ective was a further investigation of the variability of currents (Southern Trades Current, Lomonosov Current and Westerly Equatorial Intermediate Current) and associated oceanological characteristics. The observatians in the polygon included current measurements along the merdians 23�30'W and 18�30'W in spring (10 March-2 May) and in sumaner (20 June-12 Aug~st) in the northern hemi- sphere, hydrological sections along these meridians and a summer hydrological sur- vey within the polygon and beyond its limits to the west and east. All the observa- tions were made on the spring and su~ner voyages of the scientific research ships \"Akademik Kurchatov\" and \"Professor Shtokman.\" Both in spring and in summer the total duration of current measurements at automatic buoy stations was about 50 days this being one of the longest such series of equatorial currents in the Atlantic. This article gives an analysis of the spatial-temporal variability of discharges and some other current characteristics. The mean daily values of the zonal and mer- idional components of currents were computed for each observation horizon. Then these values w~re used in computing the mean discharges of zonal and meridional cur- rents. The zonal discharges were determined along t~e meridians 23�30' and 18�30'W for sections bounded by 1 1/2 degress north and south latitude and the horizons 15 and 250 m. The meridional discharges were determined along the parallels 1�30'S, 0�40'S, 0�00, 0�40'N and 1�30'N for sections bounded by 23�30' and 18�30'W.and the t~orizons 15 and 250 m. It was found~that the discharges of zonal currents vary ir- regularly with time and asynchronously along the flow with periods exceeding 30 days. The discharges of ineridional currents with periods close to the periods of meandering of the Lomonosov Current vary consistently along the meridians. The ~ computed vert~~al velocity values do not exceed 1000�10'S cm/sec. The role of iner- ; idionz~l flows in the weakening or strengthening of the Lomonosov Current is demon- strated.

[Article by A. P. Kopylov, candidate of geographical sciences, State Fiydrological Institute] , [Abstract] The inadequate mathematical validity of the formulas proposed in the UN~SCU publ~.cation RLPRESENTATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL BASINS (1971) and in various studies published by G. A. Alekseyev has been clearly pointed out by the author = of this critical communication in his article in METEOROLOGIYA I GIDROLOGIYA, No 7, 1978. The principal reason for the negative evaluation of the formulas was that they do not take ~nto account the degree of dissection of the watershed sur- face. The hypsographic curve for a watershed and the equivalent rectangular water- shed used in connection with these formulas do not carry information on slopes and - therefore their use in computations is without ~ustification. Nevertheless, this matter has been raised a,new in an article by Do M. Kudritskiy in METEOROLOGIYA I GIDROLOGIYA, No 1, 1980. This author endeavored to defend these poorly substantiat- ed formulas on the basis of assumptions for which there is no backing and sought to discredit the Kopylov formulas on the basis of false assertions. Accordingly, this communication deals with the most important of these errors in Kudritskiy's article. The communication appears to successfully refute the Kudritskiy thesis.

He completely rejects the arguments presented on this subject by i D. M. Kudritskiy in METEOROLOGIYA I GIDROLOGIYA, No 1, 1980; he feels f urther i that debate on the subject should come to an end. In this short communication the author notes that mean slope characterizes well only uniform basins. He stresses 'I t:at if the parts of the basin differ from one another with respect to orography, forest cover, etc., the examination of slopes must be made separately for uniform parts of the basin; these individual findings can then be brought together by use of a special parameter characterizing the orographic non~xniformi.ty of the basin.. The problems involved in obtaining such a parameter are discussed.

[Text] Abstract: The author briefly examines mat- erials from an unofficial conference of WMO experts on long-range weather forecast- ing (Geneva, 1-5 September 1980). This report ' gives some data on the status of research on this problem in a number of countries. Infor~ mation is given on the measures which will be carried out in the futurQ for further develop~ ment of investigations of the considered prob- lem. , An unofficial c~nference of WMO experts on long-range weather forecasting (LRWF) for a month and a season in advance was held in Geneva during the period 1-5 September 1980. The conference, organized by the WMO, was attended by the follow- ing persans: the General Secretary of the WMO Wiin-Nielsen, Miyakoda, Somerville, Epstein and Gilman from the United States, Bengtsson from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Parker from the Meteorological Service of Great Britain, Koflan from the Meteorological Bureau of Australia~ Kikuchi from the .Tapanese Meteorological Agency, the Director of the Department of Scientific Research at the WMO A. S. Zaytsev, the Director of the GARP Joint Planning Group Deyes, a consultant of the jJMO World Climate Program Beauville, and also special- ists of the WMO Secretariat Bozhkov and Suzuki. Sh. A. Musayelyan of the Soviet ' Union par.ticipated in the work of the conference. The conference was opened by the General Secretary of the WMO Wiin-Nielsen, who in his opening address stated, in particular, \"Despite the fact that significant re- sults have not been obtained in the field of LRWF up to the present time over the ~ course of a number of decades, nevertheless there is hope that long-range weather forecasting is possible. When we speak of a limit of predictability of 1-2 weeks, reference is to existing models. If it is found that this is actually so, one must proceed in another direction: develop a new, more realistic strategy and for attaining the final ob~ective travel a long and difficult path. The LRWF problem is a problem which must be solved by all working together. The repre- sentatives of. the governments of many countries are very interested in the 33 - FOR OFFiCIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00854R004400080003-6 _ FOR OF'FICIAL USE ONLY development of new, more perfect LRWF methods. We have met in order to discuss the present status of the problem, to evaluate existing methods and outline , further research and formulate a new strategy.\" The principal objective of the conference was a discussion, on the basis of re- view reports of WMO experts, of the status of the LRWF problem and the formula- tion of preliminary measures which are necessary for the further development of re- _ search on the considered problem. With respect to these measures, it was decid- ed to plan a publication TECHNICAL NOTES OF THE WMO on LRWF which should deal with the following problems: empirical, statistical, dynamic and combined methods of LRWF, interaction between the c~cean and atmosphere and allowance for these in the development of LRWF methods, and also the ~~roblem of atmospheric predictabil- ity. In addition, it was decided to organize and carry out a research conference on LRWF. _ Then the floor was given to Deyes. He told of the World Climatic Research Program in precise conformity to the report of the first session of the special committee which met in Amsterdam during the period 26 March-3 April 1980. He noted that a number of factors (cloud cover and radiation, ocean processes, sea ice, hydro- logical processes, etc.), playing an important role in the genesis of climate, are also exceptionally important in developing LRWF methods. Then the review reports of the experts were presented. Gilman told of the work of the Climatic Research Center of the United States National Weather Service. The Center gives monthly and seasonal (fo~r times a year) weather forecasts. Numerical forecasts for five days, and also forecasts for intermediate times are used in determining the onset of the period for the preparation of monthly forecasts. These forecasts are disseminated to the United States Department oE ~nergy and other organizations. In the preparation of month- ly forecasts use is made for the most part of inean five-day pressure pattern charts (surface charts are used less frequently). Particularly great attention is given to AT~p~ pressure pattern charts. Sometimes on these charts there are macroscale peculiarities of ineteorological fields which change little with time. This makes it possible to employ the extrapolation procedure. The seasonal peculiazities of ineteorological elements and f ields are also taken into account. Temperature and precipitation anomalies are predicted. This year the predictions for summer were very poor. Earlier almost always oaly the kinematics of pressure formations was used. Investigations are now being made for taking other factors into account. Particularly great significance is being given to checking of the Namias hypothesis. Work is continuing on a detailed study of the relationship between anomalies of water temperature at the ocean surface and deviations of the altitude of the 700-mb isobaric surface from the norm. - Kikuchi presented a review of investigations made by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. In Japan experimental LRWF were first prepared in 1907 in order to supply interested organizations with information on summer weather conditions in the northern part of the country where rice fields are situated. Since 1942 LRWF have been compiled for the entire territory of the country and are published almost regularly (the only excepti~~n being 1949-1952). The .lapanese Meteorological Agency regularly, on a routine basis, is issuing the following LRWF: monthly, three-monthly, for the cold and warm half-years. 34 ' ~ FOR OFFlCIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2407102/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400480003-6 F'OR OFF'ICIAL USE OAILY The monthly forecasts for each month are issued on the tenth day of the preced- ing month and are made more precise on its last day. Predictions are made for anomalies of inean temperature and the quantity of pre- cipitation for each of the regions in Japan and the synoptic situation is pre- dicted for each subsequent 10-day period. Three-month forecasts are issued on the 20th of each month. These same el.ements and mean weather conditions for each of the three subsequent months are predict- ed, including summer and winter respectively. A forecast for the warm half-year is issued on 20 March, and for the cold half-year on 10 October. These forecasts give the general characteristics of the anticipated weather, such as late spring, early autumn, etc. ~ The following methods are used at the present time in the preparation of LRSJF: Analogues Method The forecast is prepared in two stages: 1) Selection of analogues for circulation conditions at the 500 mb isobaric sur- , face. i ~ In choosing the analogues as a measure of similarity use is made of the percentage of coincidence with respect to the sign of the AT500 anomaly in the current field ~ and in the archival fields during this same calendar period of past years (a geo- ~ graphical grid for the northern hemisphere with a uniform interval in latitude and longitude equal to 10� is used). Three groups of such evaluations are consider- ed: a) for hemispherical mean monthly fields this evaluation must be greater than the critical value; b) for fields averaged for 2., 4 and 6 five-day periods this evaluation must be over 50% ((only those points of intersection at which the current values of the AT AT500 anomalies are greater than 1.28o'are used (d is computed on the basis of ar- chival data at the selected point of intersection during this same calendar period j' of past years)]; ~ c) this evaluation must be greater than the critical value for the mean monthly fields when the computations incLsde only points of intersection exerting an in- ' fluence on the specific ob,ject of the forecast (the asynchronous correlation co- efficient between the AT500 anomaly at this point of intersection and the devia- tion of the mean monthly temperature or the precipitation total from the norm at a st~3tion in the considered region for the considered calendar period and a stip- ulated timc in advance: one, two or three months more than 0.3). The best variant of all the three enumerated analogues is used in the final stage of the forecast. 2) Preparatian of monthly forecasts of temperature and precipitation anomalies. In predicting the mean monthly temperature or the monthly sums of precipitation in a stipulated region use is made of data on the above-mentioned characteristics with a time shift of one, two or three manths, after the analogues of atmospheric circulation have been selected for.this case. 35 FOR OFFICIAI, iJSE O1VLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R040400080003-6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Correlation Method , Use is made of asynchronous relationships with a time shift of one, two and three months between the mean monthly values of the altitude of the 500-mb isobaric sur- face at each point of intersection of a 5� geographical grid for the northern hemi- ; sphere and the anomaly of inean monthly temperature for a particular meteorological station. Regions with the highest correlation coefficient are selected and a prognostic multiple regression equation is written for predicting the temperature anomaly at a particular station where the AT500 anomalies are the predictors. , Extrapolation of Periodic Components Method a) A harmonic analysis of the mean 10-~day zonal circulation indices is made at the ~ 500-mb level for the past 36 10-day periods. The two prevailing periods are dis- criminated and on this basis there is a prediction of the mean S~day index of zonal circuiation for one or even for three months. [In the USSR similar work ha.s been done over a period of years by V. D. Reshetov.J - b) A similar analysis is made for mean 10-day anomalies of altitudes of the 5~0-mb isobaric surfaces with use of data on 66 elapsed 10-day periods applicable to each point of intersection of the employed grid. This procedure is used for predicting the mean 10-day anomalies of altitudes of the 500-mb isobaric surface for regions in the Far East. c) The above-mentioned harmonic analysis procedure with subsequent extrapolation ~ of the periodic components is also used in computing the prognostic charts of the mean monthly anomaly of altitudes of the 500-mb surface for the northern hemisphere. The mean monthly anomalies of the mentioned fields for the 29 success- ive eiapsed months are used. The computations are made for each point in the em- ployed geographical grid in the northern hemisphere. d) Employing the results in a)-c), his synoptic experience and common sense, the forecaster makes a final decision. Forecasts of temperature anomalies for the period from 1977 through 1979 have the following guaranteed probability with respect to sign in percent: Lst 10 days 2d 10 days 3d 10 days Monthly forecasts 66 62 '+2 � lst month 2d month 3d month Three-month forecasts 58 58 58 = During this same period the precipitation forecasts have the following guaranteed probability: - lst month 2d month 3d month Three-month forecasts 66 65 66 The following scientific research work is being done in order to improve the qual- ity of LRWI': 36 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/09: CIA-RDP82-00850R000400080003-6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY A four-level spectral model intended for monthly forecasts is being developed. Existing methods are being improved by making use of three-dimensional data, in particular, for study of the vertical propagation of the blocking process, ~etc . Investigations are being made on the use of water temperature at the ocean sur- _ face, snow cover and cloud cover distribution. Forecasting methods are being developed for the southern hemisphere. This, in the opinion of the speaker, should assist in 3mproving the precipitation forecast. A review of LRWF investigations in the Soviet Union was given by the author almost cnmpletely on the basis of articles by N. A. Bagrov, Ye. N. Blinova, D. A. Ped', K. A. Vasyukov and N. I. Zverev, included in the collection of articl es PYAT'DES$AT LET TSENTRU GIDROMETEOROLOGICHESKIKH PROGNOZOV (Fifty Years at the Hydrometeorolog- - ical Forecasting Center), 1979, and in accordance with an article publ ished by Academician G. I. Marchuk entitled \"Hydrodynamic Models in the Dynamic s of the At- mosphere and Ocean,\" included in the collection of articles PROBLEMY SOVREMENNOY GIDROMETEOROLOGII (Problems in Modern Hydrometeorology) (Leningrad, Gidrometeoiz- dat, 1977). In addition, the review included some results obtained at the Hydro- meteorological Center using the cloud cover of the oceans in LRWF. The review was supplied with an extensive bibliography of LRWF investigations of Soviet auth- ors. ~I I In the review by Parker (Meteorological Service of Great Britain) it was pointed out that in Great Britain LRWF have been issued since 1963 but soon such fore- ~ casts will be suspended because no funds will be available for such work. For the ~ time being the service will continue to issue forecasts for 5-15 and 16 -25 days, which are being used by petroleum workers. Seasonal forecast~ are prepared each three months and are issued by private organizations. These forecasts for the re- - gion,taking in the territory of Great Britain and part of the territory of Europe, are prepared making use o� ttie tollowing methods: 1. Analogues method. The review gave an analysis of the actual observat ional data, which, in the opinion of the speaker, demonstrates the basic possibil ity of pre- _ paring forecasts using analogues. It is shown that this method has a statistical- ~ ly significant prognostic capability, although the results are not always satis- I factory. The quality of analysis of inean monthly aerological charts, e specially ~ over the oceans, can e~cert an influence on the process of selecting analogues. ~ ' ; 2. Sea water temperature. At the present time work is being done in Great Britain ~ for improving the quality of analysis of the water temperature fields at the ; ocean surface. This can assist in improving the method for selecting analogues and investigations on the basis of numerical modeling. 3. Numerical modeling. LRWF forecasts are precomputed for a month in advance using - a five-level model with primitive equations. This model take~ into account water temperature at the ocean surface, moist convection and also the radiat ion effects of clouds and the snow cover (using seasonal cli~atological data). The model was developed for the northern hemispl-aere. However, these forecasts are u sed in prac- � tical work with great caution. Exceasive polar anticyclogenesis creates gr"
