        "text": "The Influence of Climatogeographic Conditions on the Expansion of the Range of Ixodes Ticks (Review)\n\nVladimir Nikolaevich Domatskiy1, Elena Ivanovna Sivkova1*\n\n1All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Veterinary Entomology and Arachnology- Branch of Federal State Institution Federal Research Centre Tyumen Scientific Centre of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Tyumen, Russian Federation.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nGlobal warming contributes to the widespread spread of some of the main vectors of natural-focal infections. Ixodid ticks can inhabit large numbers both in woodlands and in meadow and pasture areas. Recent decades have seen a shift in the habitats of many parasites to the northern regions, which contributes to the survival and reproduction of not only the vectors themselves but also to the completion of the development cycle of ticks. The growth of the population size and duration of the spring-autumn period of tick activity increases the period of the epidemic season. The epidemiological situation is complicated by the persistence and almost constant activity of natural foci of arthropod-borne infections. Weather conditions, precipitation, humidity (relative humidity of at least 85%), and air temperature affect the life cycle and range of ixodid ticks. These factors make a certain contribution to geographical expansion due to changes in the habitats of vegetation and carriers in the wild (animals, birds, and rodents), which carry ticks to new territories. The northern border of the area of ixodid infections – viral tick-borne encephalitis and ixodid borreliosis - lies now beyond the borders of the Arctic. However, there is evidence of a possible movement of these boundaries to the north, so the southern part of the Arctic region may fall into the zone of potential risk of transmission of these infections.\n\nKeywords: Ixodid ticks, Infections, Climate, Habitat expansion, Viability.\n\nThe trend of climate warming on the territory of the Russian Federation continues, it manifests in the form of raised temperature anomalies of all seasons of the year and has a favorable effect on all stages of the development of H. marginatum ixodid ticks and contributes to the fact that the boundaries of the circulation of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) shift to the north. The high number of the main carrier of the causative agent of Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CHF) and the expansion of its distribution area contributes to the increase in the incidence in the population. Thus, the observed current trends in climate change in Russia have a positive impact on the development of H. marginatum ixodid ticks. The high epizootic activity of the natural focus of CHF contributes to the preservation of a tense epidemiological situation on this disease in the southern European part of the Russian Federation. The results of the conducted studies demonstrate the complex multifactorial influence of climate on the change of all stages of the life cycle of the main vector and reservoir of the CHF virus. In addition to the well-known effect of air temperature on the development of ixodid ticks, the relationship of the dynamics of epidemic manifestations of CCHF with the humidification regime of the territory in different periods of the year has been established. It was established that the most significant influence on the vital activity of H. marginatum has the temperature and the amount of precipitation in late May and June – early July when the egg-laying process and the development of preimaginal phases take place. In addition, the preservation of the viability of wintering individuals of ticks depends on the temperatures in January – early February. Thus, the multifactorial effect of climate determines not only the duration of the imago activity period but also the number of individuals of subsequent generations. Due to the ongoing climate warming, the boundary of the CHF pathogen is shifting in the northern direction. This creates a risk of infection spreading beyond the southern regions of the Russian Federation with the involvement of new territories in the epidemic process [25].\n\nThe problem of tick-borne infections is becoming more and more urgent due to the intensive introduction of blood-sucking arthropods parasitizing birds: the shift of the habitats of birds carrying them to the northern regions contributes to the survival and reproduction of not only the vectors themselves but also to the completion of the development cycle of tick-borne pathogens in them, being the cause of pathogen invasions. The conducted studies have shown that the change in the areas of blood-sucking ectoparasites and the pathogens they carry is a consequence of global climate warming. In this regard, the shift of the southern boundaries of the IE and borreliosis habitats to the north is due to changes in the structure of vegetation and an increased dryness at the southern boundaries of the ranges of these vectors. The boundaries of the permitted development of the IE vector in mountainous areas are shifted upwards, and its foci are found at a higher altitude. The increase in temperatures increases the time when infected ticks can attack a person. The onset of the more thermophilic I. ricinus with the predominance of borrelia species in it, or the expansion of sympatric territories, as well as the displacement of I. persulcatus to the northeast in relatively sparsely populated areas of Russia are observed. It should be emphasized that the invasion of new species of tick-borne pathogens is associated not only with their infestation of I. ricinus ticks but also with the introduction of new species of blood-sucking ixodids by birds. It was the climate molding that contributed to the penetration of the species of southern blood-sucking Hyalomma marginatum marginatum Koch, 1844 and Ixodes frontalis Panzer, 1798 ticks to the north and, quite possibly, will contribute to the transformation of the accidental introduction of these vectors into their naturalization. Under the influence of climate warming and increased environmental pollution, new populations of existing vector species with new modified properties will appear [6-8, 26-28].\n\nThe study of the complex effect of climatic factors of different seasons on the development of all stages of the life cycle of H. marginatum and the dynamics of morbidity of the population of CHF was carried out on the example of the Stavropol Territory. Strong correlations of the air temperature, the amount of precipitation in the winter (direct correlation) and spring (inverse correlation) of the current year with the index of the abundance of ticks on farm animals, their number when collecting \"on the checker\", and the summer period (previous epidemic season) – with the indices of the abundance of larvae, H. marginatum nymphs, and also with the number of registered patients with CHF [29, 30].\n\nThe presence of four species of Ixodes ticks has been established on the territory of the city of Stavropol (Russia): Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Activation of D. marginatus after the winter diapause occurs in the spring period (March, April). In winter, during thaws, D. marginatus becomes more active in mid-February, which was confirmed by the fact that people came to medical institutions and when examining domestic carnivores (dogs). The peak of imago parasitization is observed in the third decade of April. During the summer period (July, mid-August), the imago has diapause. The number of D. marginatus in the autumn months is much lower. Activation can be recorded starting in the third decade of August. Parasitism on animals and cases of attacks on humans can be registered until November. R. sanguineus is a massive species of the Ixodaceae family, parasitizing carnivores. Activation happens in March-April. The peak of imago parasitization on feeders falls in the first decades of May. In summer, there is a slight depression, and the autumn wave then is much smaller than the spring one. Parasitization of the preimaginal phases of development on feeders is noted in June with a peak in July. Observations indicate the synanthropy of this tick since most of the collections were performed during the examination of pets (dogs, cats). The circle of R. sanguineus feeders is represented mainly by domestic carnivores – dogs, and cats, while the first dominate. During the examination of natural biotopes, R. sanguineus is found mainly in settlements, private households, near outbuildings, in open-air cages and dog kennels, and in their litter. There were cases of tick penetration into residential premises. People removed ticks from a blanket, an armchair, a palace, from curtains, which most likely was because R. sanguineus was brought directly by both pets and people themselves on clothes. In addition, there were cases of this tick attacking a person. In the vicinity of the city of Stavropol, in addition to these species, there are Haemaphysalis punctata ticks. In suburban areas neighboring cattle grazing sites, H. marginatum is found [31].\n\nInfections transmitted by ticks due to the availability of vast natural territories that are their nosoareals require constant epidemiological and epizootological monitoring and control. The number of requests for medical care in the Russian Federation for the suction of ticks in 2021 amounted to 309.49 per 100 thousand population, and the average annual figure for the entire period of official registration of such requests (2014-2021) was 342.34 per 100 thousand population [32].\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHabitat boundaries, the number of ixodid ticks, and manifestations of epidemiological activity have been changing in recent decades, as a result of intensive anthropogenic impact on natural complexes against the background of climatic deviations. The epidemiological situation is complicated by the persistence and almost constant activity of natural foci of vector-borne infections, the expansion of the area, and an increase in the number of ticks, while specific prevention is applied only in tick-borne encephalitis and tularemia. Hence, there is a need to have information about the current species composition of these parasitic arthropods. It is established that to date, the dominance indices of Dermacentor and Ixodes ticks do not depend on the types of natural biotopes: parasites can live in significant numbers both in forests and in meadow and pasture areas. The data obtained as a result of the study indicate the need for a more detailed study of the biological and physiological characteristics of ixodid ticks in the context of their actual climate and geographical preferences, as well as effective monitoring of tick populations, even in non-endemic areas, to predict the occurrence or increase the incidence of tick-borne infections and invasions, their timely prevention and treatment [33].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: None\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST: None\n\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT: The article was prepared in accordance with the research plan for the program of fundamental scientific research of the Russian Academy of Sciences (No. 121042000066-6 “Study and analysis of the epizootic state of diseases of invasive etiology of agricultural and unproductive animals, bees and birds, changes in the species composition and bioecological patterns of the development cycle of parasites in conditions of displacement of boundaries their ranges)."
