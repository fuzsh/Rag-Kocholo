Patterns of lakes, wetlands, general soil moisture conditions and vegetation physiognomy are represented at 10 m. About 40 % of the area north of the treeline falls into three units of dry types, with limited shrub growth. Wetter regions have higher landcover diversity than drier regions.\n\nLandcover succession for recently drained lakes in permafrost on the Yamal peninsula, Western Siberia\n\nClemens von Baeckmann, Annett Bartsch, Helena Bergstedt, Aleksandra Efimova, Barbara Widhalm, Dorothee Ehrich, Timo Kumpula, Alexander Sokolov, and Svetlana Abdulmanova\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes are common features in Arctic permafrost areas. Landcover change following their drainage needs to be monitored since it has implications for ecology and the carbon cycle. Satellite data are key in this context. We compared a common vegetation index approach with a novel landcover monitoring scheme. Landcover information provides specifically information on wetland features. We also showed that the bioclimatic gradients play a significant role after drainage within the first 10 years.\n\nCan C-band synthetic aperture radar be used to estimate soil organic carbon storage in tundra?\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Barbara Widhalm, Peter Kuhry, Gustaf Hugelius, Juri Palmtag, and Matthias Benjamin Siewert\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5453–5470, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5453-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5453-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new approach for the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools north of the tree line has been developed based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the ENVISAT satellite. It can be shown that measurements of C-band SAR under frozen conditions represent vegetation and surface structure properties which relate to soil properties, specifically SOC. The approach provides the first spatially consistent account of soil organic carbon across the Arctic.\n\nCircumarctic land cover diversity considering wetness gradients\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Aleksandra Efimova, Barbara Widhalm, Xaver Muri, Clemens von Baeckmann, Helena Bergstedt, Ksenia Ermokhina, Gustaf Hugelius, Birgit Heim, and Marina Leibman\n\nHydrol.

Patterns of lakes, wetlands, general soil moisture conditions and vegetation physiognomy are represented at 10 m. About 40 % of the area north of the treeline falls into three units of dry types, with limited shrub growth. Wetter regions have higher landcover diversity than drier regions.\n\nLandcover succession for recently drained lakes in permafrost on the Yamal peninsula, Western Siberia\n\nClemens von Baeckmann, Annett Bartsch, Helena Bergstedt, Aleksandra Efimova, Barbara Widhalm, Dorothee Ehrich, Timo Kumpula, Alexander Sokolov, and Svetlana Abdulmanova\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes are common features in Arctic permafrost areas. Landcover change following their drainage needs to be monitored since it has implications for ecology and the carbon cycle. Satellite data are key in this context. We compared a common vegetation index approach with a novel landcover monitoring scheme. Landcover information provides specifically information on wetland features. We also showed that the bioclimatic gradients play a significant role after drainage within the first 10 years.\n\nWetCH4: A Machine Learning-based Upscaling of Methane Fluxes of Northern Wetlands during 2016–2022\n\nQing Ying, Benjamin Poulter, Jennifer D.

Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-84,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-84, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ESSD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present daily methane fluxes of northern wetlands at 10-km resolution during 2016–2022 (WetCH4) derived from a novel machine-learning framework with improved accuracy. We estimated an average annual CH4 emissions of 20.8 ±2.1 Tg CH4 yr-1. Emissions were intensified in 2016, 2020, and 2022, with the largest interannual variations coming from West Siberia. Continued, all-season tower observations and improved soil moisture products are needed for future improvement of CH4 upscaling.\n\nExploring the decision-making process in model development: focus on the Arctic snowpack\n\nCecile B.

Forbes, Gerhard Krinner, David Lawrence, Glen Liston, Heidrun Matthes, Nick Rutter, Melody Sandells, Martin Schneebeli, and Sari Stark\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2926,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2926, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComputer models, like those used in climate change studies, are written by modelers who have to decide how best to construct the models in order to satisfy the purpose they serve. Using snow modeling as an example, we examine the process behind the decisions to understand what motivates or limits modelers in their decision-making. We found that the context in which research is undertaken is often more crucial than scientific limitations. We argue for more transparency into our research practice.\n\nTowards long-term records of rain-on-snow events across the Arctic from satellite data\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Helena Bergstedt, Georg Pointner, Xaver Muri, Kimmo Rautiainen, Leena LeppÃ¤nen, Kyle Joly, Aleksandr Sokolov, Pavel Orekhov, Dorothee Ehrich, and Eeva Mariatta Soininen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 889–915, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-889-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-889-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRain-on-snow (ROS) events occur across many regions of the terrestrial Arctic in mid-winter. In extreme cases ice layers form which affect wildlife, vegetation and soils beyond the duration of the event. The fusion of multiple types of microwave satellite observations is suggested for the creation of a climate data record. Retrieval is most robust in the tundra biome, where records can be used to identify extremes and the results can be applied to impact studies at regional scale.\n\nDevelopment of the global dataset of Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M)\n\nZhen Zhang, Etienne Fluet-Chouinard, Katherine Jensen, Kyle McDonald, Gustaf Hugelius, Thomas Gumbricht, Mark Carroll, Catherine Prigent, Annett Bartsch, and Benjamin Poulter\n\nEarth Syst.

Data, 13, 2001–2023, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2001-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-2001-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe spatiotemporal distribution of wetlands is one of the important and yet uncertain factors determining the time and locations of methane fluxes. The Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M) dataset describes the global data product used to quantify the areal dynamics of natural wetlands and how global wetlands are changing in response to climate.\n\nThe water column of the Yamal tundra lakes as a microbial filter preventing methane emission\n\nAlexander Savvichev, Igor Rusanov, Yury Dvornikov, Vitaly Kadnikov, Anna Kallistova, Elena Veslopolova, Antonina Chetverova, Marina Leibman, Pavel A. Sigalevich, Nikolay Pimenov, Nikolai Ravin, and Artem Khomutov\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2791–2807, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2791-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2791-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrobial processes of the methane cycle were studied in four lakes of the central part of the Yamal Peninsula in an area of continuous permafrost: two large, deep lakes and two small and shallow ones. It was found that only small, shallow lakes contributed significantly to the overall diffusive methane emissions from the water surface during the warm summer season. The water column of large, deep lakes on Yamal acted as a microbial filter preventing methane emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nMapping potential signs of gas emissions in ice of Lake Neyto, Yamal, Russia, using synthetic aperture radar and multispectral remote sensing data\n\nGeorg Pointner, Annett Bartsch, Yury A. Dvornikov, and Alexei V. Kouraev\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1907–1929, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1907-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1907-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents strong new indications that regions of anomalously low backscatter in C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of ice of Lake Neyto in northwestern Siberia are related to strong emissions of natural gas. Spatio-temporal dynamics and potential scattering and formation mechanisms are assessed. It is suggested that exploiting the spatial and temporal properties of Sentinel-1 SAR data may be beneficial for the identification of similar phenomena in other Arctic lakes.\n\nThe Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) high-priority candidate mission\n\nMichael Kern, Robert Cullen, Bruno Berruti, Jerome Bouffard, Tania Casal, Mark R.

This paper describes the mission objectives, identifies the key contributions the CRISTAL mission will make, and presents a concept – as far as it is already defined – for the mission payload.\n\nPan-Antarctic map of near-surface permafrost temperatures at 1 km2 scale\n\nJaroslav Obu, Sebastian Westermann, GonÃ§alo Vieira, Andrey Abramov, Megan Ruby Balks, Annett Bartsch, Filip HrbÃ¡Äek, Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b, and Miguel Ramos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 497–519, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-497-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-497-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLittle is known about permafrost in the Antarctic outside of the few research stations. We used a simple equilibrium permafrost model to estimate permafrost temperatures in the whole Antarctic. The lowest permafrost temperature on Earth is −36 °C in the Queen Elizabeth Range in the Transantarctic Mountains. Temperatures are commonly between −23 and −18 °C in mountainous areas rising above the Antarctic Ice Sheet, between −14 and −8 °C in coastal areas, and up to 0 °C on the Antarctic Peninsula.\n\nCircumpolar patterns of potential mean annual ground temperature based on surface state obtained from microwave satellite data\n\nChristine Kroisleitner, Annett Bartsch, and Helena Bergstedt\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2349–2370, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2349-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2349-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge about permafrost extent is required with respect to climate change. We used borehole temperature records from across the Arctic for the assessment of surface status information (frozen or unfrozen) derived from space-borne microwave sensors for permafrost extent mapping. The comparison to mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the coldest sensor depth revealed that not only extent but also temperature can be obtained from C-band-derived surface state with a residual error of 2.22 Â°C.\n\nCarbon stocks and fluxes in the high latitudes: using site-level data to evaluate Earth system models\n\nSarah E.

The Arctic is important for the future carbon cycle, particularly due to the large carbon stocks in permafrost. We evaluated the performance of the land component of three major ESMs at Arctic tundra sites, focusing on the fluxes and stocks of carbon. We show that the next steps for model improvement are to better represent vegetation dynamics, to include mosses and to improve below-ground carbon cycle processes.\n\nPeRL: aÂ circum-Arctic Permafrost Region Pond andÂ LakeÂ database\n\nSina Muster, Kurt Roth, Moritz Langer, Stephan Lange, Fabio Cresto Aleina, Annett Bartsch, Anne Morgenstern, Guido Grosse, Benjamin Jones, A.

Most waterbodies are ponds with a surface area smaller than 100 x 100 m. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake Database (PeRL) for the first time maps ponds as small as 10 x 10 m. PeRL maps can be used to document changes both by comparing them to historical and future imagery. The distribution of waterbodies in the Arctic is important to know in order to manage resources in the Arctic and to improve climate predictions in the Arctic.\n\nCan C-band synthetic aperture radar be used to estimate soil organic carbon storage in tundra?\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Barbara Widhalm, Peter Kuhry, Gustaf Hugelius, Juri Palmtag, and Matthias Benjamin Siewert\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5453–5470, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5453-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5453-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new approach for the estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools north of the tree line has been developed based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the ENVISAT satellite. It can be shown that measurements of C-band SAR under frozen conditions represent vegetation and surface structure properties which relate to soil properties, specifically SOC.

Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1211–1223, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1211-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1211-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGridded fields of daily max. and min. temperatures for the Austrian domain are used to calculate ET0 based on a re-calibrated Hargreaves method. Newly derived, station-based calibration parameters, with PenmanâMonteith ET0 as a reference, show a distinct altitude and seasonal dependence. Theses features are used to interpolate the new calibration values in space and time onto the temperature grids. The ET0 is then calculated based on the entire gridded temperature data starting back in 1961.\n\nA comparison between remotely-sensed and modelled surface soil moisture (and frozen status) at high latitudes\n\nI.

Herbert, Mark S. Raleigh, and Eric E. Small\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3495–3512, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAutomated stations measure snow properties at a single point but are frequently used to validate data that represent much larger areas. We use lidar snow depth data to see how often the mean snow depth surrounding a snow station is within 10 cm of the snow station depth at different scales. We found snow stations overrepresent the area-mean snow depth in ~ 50 % of cases, but the direction of bias at a site is temporally consistent, suggesting a site could be calibrated to the surrounding area.\n\nThe AutoICE Challenge\n\nAndreas Stokholm, JÃ¸rgen Buus-Hinkler, Tore Wulf, Anton Korosov, Roberto Saldo, Leif Toudal Pedersen, David Arthurs, Ionut Dragan, Iacopo Modica, Juan Pedro, Annekatrien Debien, Xinwei Chen, Muhammed Patel, Fernando Jose Pena Cantu, Javier Noa Turnes, Jinman Park, Linlin Xu, Katharine Andrea Scott, David Anthony Clausi, Yuan Fang, Mingzhe Jiang, Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan, Neil Curtis Brubacher, Armina Soleymani, Zacharie Gousseau, MichaÅ Smaczny, Patryk Kowalski, Jacek Komorowski, David Rijlaarsdam, Jan Nicolaas van Rijn, Jens Jakobsen, Martin Samuel James Rogers, Nick Hughes, Tom Zagon, Rune Solberg, Nicolas LongÃ©pÃ©, and Matilde Brandt Kreiner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3471–3494, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3471-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3471-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe AutoICE challenge encouraged the development of deep learning models to map multiple aspects of sea ice – the amount of sea ice in an area and the age and ice floe size – using multiple sources of satellite and weather data across the Canadian and Greenlandic Arctic. Professionally drawn operational sea ice charts were used as a reference. A total of 179 students and sea ice and AI specialists participated and produced maps in broad agreement with the sea ice charts.\n\nObserving glacier elevation changes from spaceborne optical and radar sensors â an inter-comparison experiment using ASTER and TanDEM-X data\n\nLivia Piermattei, Michael Zemp, Christian Sommer, Fanny Brun, Matthias H.

In the present study, we compared the results produced from two different types of satellite data between different research groups and against validation measurements from aeroplanes. We found a large spread between individual results but showed that the group ensemble can be used to reliably estimate glacier elevation changes and related errors from satellite data.\n\nTower-based C-band radar measurements of an alpine snowpack\n\nIsis Brangers, Hans-Peter Marshall, Gabrielle De Lannoy, Devon Dunmire, Christian MÃ¤tzler, and Hans Lievens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3177–3193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand the interactions between C-band radar waves and snow, a tower-based experiment was set up in the Idaho Rocky Mountains. The reflections were collected in the time domain to measure the backscatter profile from the various snowpack and ground surface layers. The results demonstrate that C-band radar is sensitive to seasonal patterns in snow accumulation but that changes in microstructure, stratigraphy and snow wetness may complicate satellite-based snow depth retrievals.\n\nA study of sea ice topography in the Weddell and Ross seas using dual-polarimetric TanDEM-X imagery\n\nLanqing Huang and Irena Hajnsek\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3117–3140, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3117-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3117-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInterferometric synthetic aperture radar can measure the total freeboard of sea ice but can be biased when radar signals penetrate snow and ice. We develop a new method to retrieve the total freeboard and analyze the regional variation of total freeboard and roughness in the Weddell and Ross seas. We also investigate the statistical behavior of the total freeboard for diverse ice types. The findings enhance the understanding of Antarctic sea ice topography and its dynamics in a changing climate.\n\nEstimating differential penetration of green (532 nm) laser light over sea ice with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper: observations and models\n\nMichael Studinger, Benjamin E. Smith, Nathan Kurtz, Alek Petty, Tyler Sutterley, and Rachel Tilling\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2625–2652, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2625-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2625-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use green lidar data and natural-color imagery over sea ice to quantify elevation biases potentially impacting estimates of change in ice thickness of the polar regions. We complement our analysis using a model of scattering of light in snow and ice that predicts the shape of lidar waveforms reflecting from snow and ice surfaces based on the shape of the transmitted pulse. We find that biased elevations exist in airborne and spaceborne data products from green lidars.\n\nMapping surface hoar from near-infrared texture in a laboratory\n\nJames Dillon, Christopher Donahue, Evan Schehrer, Karl Birkeland, and Kevin Hammonds\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2557–2582, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2557-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2557-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface hoar crystals are snow grains that form when vapor deposits on a snow surface. They create a weak layer in the snowpack that can cause large avalanches to occur. Thus, determining when and where surface hoar forms is a lifesaving matter. Here, we developed a means of mapping surface hoar using remote-sensing technologies. We found that surface hoar displayed heightened texture, hence the variability of brightness. Using this, we created surface hoar maps with an accuracy upwards of 95 %.\n\nSentinel-1 detection of ice slabs on the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nRiley Culberg, Roger J. Michaelides, and Julie Z. Miller\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2531–2555, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2531-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2531-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce slabs enhance meltwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Therefore, it is important to understand their extent and change in extent over time. We present a new method for detecting ice slabs in satellite radar data, which we use to map ice slabs at 500 m resolution across the entire ice sheet in winter 2016–2017. Our results provide better spatial coverage and resolution than previous maps from airborne radar and lay the groundwork for long-term monitoring of ice slabs from space.\n\nEstimating the uncertainty of sea-ice area and sea-ice extent from satellite retrievals\n\nAndreas Wernecke, Dirk Notz, Stefan Kern, and Thomas Lavergne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2473–2486, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2473-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2473-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total Arctic sea-ice area (SIA), which is an important climate indicator, is routinely monitored with the help of satellite measurements. Uncertainties in observations of sea-ice concentration (SIC) partly cancel out when summed up to the total SIA, but the degree to which this is happening has been unclear. Here we find that the uncertainty daily SIA estimates, based on uncertainties in SIC, are about 300 000 km2. The 2002 to 2017 September decline in SIA is approx. 105 000 ± 9000 km2 a−1.\n\nThermal infrared shadow-hiding in GOES-R ABI imagery: snow and forest temperature observations from the SnowEx 2020 Grand Mesa field campaign\n\nSteven J. Pestana, C. Chris Chickadel, and Jessica D. Lundquist\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2257–2276, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2257-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2257-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared infrared images taken by GOES-R satellites of an area with snow and forests against surface temperature measurements taken on the ground, from an aircraft, and by another satellite. We found that GOES-R measured warmer temperatures than the other measurements, especially in areas with more forest and when the Sun was behind the satellite. From this work, we learned that the position of the Sun and surface features such as trees that can cast shadows impact GOES-R infrared images.\n\nSea ice transport and replenishment across and within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, 2016â2022\n\nStephen E.

Glissenaar, Kaitlin McNeil, Benoit Montpetit, and Mike Brady\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2321–2333, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2321-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2321-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe CAA serves as both a source and a sink for sea ice from the Arctic Ocean, while also exporting sea ice into Baffin Bay. It is also an important region with respect to navigating the Northwest Passage. Here, we quantify sea ice transport and replenishment across and within the CAA from 2016 to 2022. We also provide the first estimates of the ice area and volume flux within the CAA from the Queen Elizabeth Islands to Parry Channel, which spans the central region of the Northwest Passage.\n\nSAR deep learning sea ice retrieval trained with airborne laser scanner measurements from the MOSAiC expedition\n\nKarl Kortum, Suman Singha, Gunnar Spreen, Nils Hutter, Arttu Jutila, and Christian Haas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2207–2222, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2207-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2207-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA dataset of 20 radar satellite acquisitions and near-simultaneous helicopter-based surveys of the ice topography during the MOSAiC expedition is constructed and used to train a variety of deep learning algorithms. The results give realistic insights into the accuracy of retrieval of measured ice classes using modern deep learning models. The models able to learn from the spatial distribution of the measured sea ice classes are shown to have a clear advantage over those that cannot.\n\nLake ice break-up in Greenland: timing and spatiotemporal variability\n\nChristoph Posch, Jakob Abermann, and Tiago Silva\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2035–2059, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2035-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2035-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRadar beams from satellites exhibit reflection differences between water and ice. This condition, as well as the comprehensive coverage and high temporal resolution of the Sentinel-1 satellites, allows automatically detecting the timing of when ice cover of lakes in Greenland disappear. We found that lake ice breaks up 3 d later per 100 m elevation gain and that the average break-up timing varies by ±8 d in 2017–2021, which has major implications for the energy budget of the lakes.\n\nTemperature-dominated spatiotemporal variability in snow phenology on the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2022\n\nJiahui Xu, Yao Tang, Linxin Dong, Shujie Wang, Bailang Yu, Jianping Wu, Zhaojun Zheng, and Yan Huang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1817–1834, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1817-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1817-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding snow phenology (SP) and its possible feedback are important. We reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneous SP on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the mediating effects from meteorological, topographic, and environmental factors on it. The direct effects of meteorology on SP are much greater than the indirect effects. Topography indirectly effects SP, while vegetation directly effects SP. This study contributes to understanding past global warming and predicting future trends on the TP.\n\nMMSeaIce: a collection of techniques for improving sea ice mapping with a multi-task model\n\nXinwei Chen, Muhammed Patel, Fernando J. Pena Cantu, Jinman Park, Javier Noa Turnes, Linlin Xu, K. Andrea Scott, and David A. Clausi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1621–1632, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1621-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1621-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces an automated sea ice mapping pipeline utilizing a multi-task U-Net architecture. It attained the top score of 86.3 % in the AutoICE challenge. Ablation studies revealed that incorporating brightness temperature data and spatial–temporal information significantly enhanced model accuracy. Accurate sea ice mapping is vital for comprehending the Arctic environment and its global climate effects, underscoring the potential of deep learning.\n\nSnow water equivalent retrieved from X- and dual Ku-band scatterometer measurements at SodankylÃ¤ using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\n\nJinmei Pan, Michael Durand, Juha Lemmetyinen, Desheng Liu, and Jiancheng Shi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1561–1578, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1561-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1561-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an algorithm to estimate snow mass using X- and dual Ku-band radar, and tested it in a ground-based experiment. The algorithm, the Bayesian-based Algorithm for SWE Estimation (BASE) using active microwaves, achieved an RMSE of 30 mm for snow water equivalent. These results demonstrate the potential of radar, a highly promising sensor, to map snow mass at high spatial resolution.\n\nLead fractions from SAR-derived sea ice divergence during MOSAiC\n\nLuisa von Albedyll, Stefan Hendricks, Nils Hutter, Dmitrii Murashkin, Lars Kaleschke, Sascha Willmes, Linda Thielke, Xiangshan Tian-Kunze, Gunnar Spreen, and Christian Haas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1259–1285, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1259-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1259-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLeads (openings in sea ice cover) are created by sea ice dynamics. Because they are important for many processes in the Arctic winter climate, we aim to detect them with satellites. We present two new techniques to detect lead widths of a few hundred meters at high spatial resolution (700 m) and independent of clouds or sun illumination. We use the MOSAiC drift 2019–2020 in the Arctic for our case study and compare our new products to other existing lead products.\n\nRetrieval of airborne Ku-Band SAR Using Forward Radiative Transfer Modeling to Estimate Snow Water Equivalent: The Trail Valley Creek 2018/19 Snow Experiment\n\nBenoit Montpetit, Joshua King, Julien Meloche, Chris Derksen, Paul Siqueira, J. Max Adam, Peter Toose, Mike Brady, Anna Wendleder, Vincent Vionnet, and Nicolas R. Leroux\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-651,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-651, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper validates the use of free open-source models to link distributed snow measurements to radar measurements in the Canadian Arctic. Using multiple radar sensors, we can decouple the soil from the snow contribution. We then retrieve the \"microwave snow grain size\" to characterize the interaction between the snow mass and the radar signal. This work supports future satellite mission development to retrieve snow mass information such as the future Canadian Terrestrial Snow Mass Mission.\n\nAssessing the sea ice microwave emissivity up to submillimeter waves from airborne and satellite observations\n\nNils Risse, Mario Mech, Catherine Prigent, Gunnar Spreen, and Susanne Crewell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-179,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-179, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite passive microwave observations are crucial for monitoring the Arctic's sea ice and atmosphere. To do this effectively, it's important to understand how sea ice emits microwaves. Through unique Arctic sea ice observations, we've improved our understanding, identifying four distinct emission types and expanding current knowledge towards higher frequencies. These findings will enhance our ability to monitor the Arctic climate and provide valuable information for new satellite missions.\n\nImproved records of glacier flow instabilities using customized NASA autoRIFT applied to PlanetScope imagery\n\nJukes Liu, Madeline Gendreau, Ellyn Mary Enderlin, and Rainey Aberle\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-374,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-374, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are sometimes gaps in global glacier velocity records produced using satellite image feature-tracking algorithms during times of rapid glacier acceleration, which hinders the study of glacier flow processes. We present an open-source pipeline for customizing the feature-tracking parameters and for including images from an additional source. We applied it to 5 glaciers and found that it produced accurate velocity data that supplemented their velocity records during rapid acceleration.\n\nBayesian physicalâstatistical retrieval of snow water equivalent and snow depth from X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar â demonstration using airborne SnowSAr in SnowEx'17\n\nSiddharth Singh, Michael Durand, Edward Kim, and Ana P. Barros\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 747–773, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-747-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-747-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeasonal snowfall accumulation plays a critical role in climate. The water stored in it is measured by the snow water equivalent (SWE), the amount of water released after completely melting. We demonstrate a Bayesian physical–statistical framework to estimate SWE from airborne X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter measurements constrained by physical snow hydrology and radar models. We explored spatial resolutions and vertical structures that agree well with ground observations.\n\nA low-cost and open-source approach for supraglacial debris thickness mapping using UAV-based infrared thermography\n\nJÃ©rÃ´me Messmer and Alexander Raphael Groos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 719–746, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-719-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-719-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe lower part of mountain glaciers is often covered with debris. Knowing the thickness of the debris is important as it influences the melting and future evolution of the affected glaciers. We have developed an open-source approach to map variations in debris thickness on glaciers using a low-cost drone equipped with a thermal infrared camera. The resulting high-resolution maps of debris surface temperature and thickness enable more accurate monitoring and modelling of debris-covered glaciers.\n\nSnow water equivalent retrieval over Idaho â Part 1: Using Sentinel-1 repeat-pass interferometry\n\nShadi Oveisgharan, Robert Zinke, Zachary Hoppinen, and Hans Peter Marshall\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 559–574, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-559-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-559-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe seasonal snowpack provides water resources to billions of people worldwide. Large-scale mapping of snow water equivalent (SWE) with high resolution is critical for many scientific and economics fields. In this work we used the radar remote sensing interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to estimate the SWE change between 2 d. The error in the estimated SWE change is less than 2 cm for in situ stations. Additionally, the retrieved SWE using InSAR is correlated with lidar snow depth.\n\nPan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration from SAR and Passive Microwave\n\nTore Wulf, JÃ¸rgen Buus-Hinkler, Suman Singha, Hoyeon Shi, and Matilde Brandt Kreiner\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-178,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-178, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we present ASIP (Automated Sea Ice Products): a new and comprehensive deep learning-based methodology to retrieve high-resolution sea ice concentration with accompanying well-calibrated uncertainties from Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2 passive microwave observations at a pan-Arctic scale for all seasons. In a comparative study against pan-Arctic ice charts and passive microwave-based sea ice products, we show that ASIP generalizes well to the pan-Arctic region.\n\nEvaluating L-band InSAR Snow Water Equivalent Retrievals with Repeat Ground-Penetrating Radar and Terrestrial Lidar Surveys in Northern Colorado\n\nRandall Bonnell, Daniel McGrath, Jack Tarricone, Hans-Peter Marshall, Ella Bump, Caroline Duncan, Stephanie Kampf, Yunling Lou, Alex Olsen-Mikitowicz, Megan Sears, Keith Williams, Lucas Zeller, and Yang Zheng\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-236,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-236, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow provides water for billions of people, but the amount of snow is difficult to detect remotely. During the 2020 and 2021 winters, a radar was flown over mountains in Colorado, USA to measure the amount of snow on the ground, while our team collected ground observations to test the radar technique’s capabilities. The technique yielded accurate measurements of the snowpack that had good correlation with ground measurements, making it a promising application for the upcoming NISAR satellite.\n\nPassive microwave remote-sensing-based high-resolution snow depth mapping for Western Himalayan zones using multifactor modeling approach\n\nDhiraj Kumar Singh, Srinivasarao Tanniru, Kamal Kant Singh, Harendra Singh Negi, and RAAJ Ramsankaran\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 451–474, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-451-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-451-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ techniques for snow depth (SD) measurement are not adequate to represent the spatiotemporal variability in SD in the Western Himalayan region. Therefore, this study focuses on the high-resolution mapping of daily snow depth in the Indian Western Himalayan region using passive microwave remote-sensing-based algorithms. Overall, the proposed multifactor SD models demonstrated substantial improvement compared to the operational products. However, there is a scope for further improvement.\n\nRefined glacial lake extraction in a high-Asia region by deep neural network and superpixel-based conditional random field methods\n\nYungang Cao, Rumeng Pan, Meng Pan, Ruodan Lei, Puying Du, and Xueqin Bai\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 153–168, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-153-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-153-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study built a glacial lake dataset with 15376 samples in seven types and proposed an automatic method by two-stage (the semantic segmentation network and post-processing) optimizations to detect glacial lakes. The proposed method for glacial lake extraction has achieved the best results so far, in which the F1 score and IoU reached 0.945 and 0.907, respectively. The area of the minimum glacial lake that can be entirely and correctly extracted has been raised to the 100 m2 level.\n\nRetrieval of snow water equivalent from dual-frequency radar measurements: using time series to overcome the need for accurate a priori information\n\nMichael Durand, Joel T. Johnson, Jack Dechow, Leung Tsang, Firoz Borah, and Edward J. Kim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 139–152, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeasonal snow accumulates each winter, storing water to release later in the year and modulating both water and energy cycles, but the amount of seasonal snow is one of the most poorly measured components of the global water cycle. Satellite concepts to monitor snow accumulation have been proposed but not selected. This paper shows that snow accumulation can be measured using radar, and that (contrary to previous studies) does not require highly accurate information about snow microstructure.\n\nIce floe segmentation and floe size distribution in airborne and high-resolution optical satellite images: towards an automated labelling deep learning approach\n\nQin Zhang and Nick Hughes\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5519–5537, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5519-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5519-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo alleviate tedious manual image annotations for training deep learning (DL) models in floe instance segmentation, we employ a classical image processing technique to automatically label floes in images. We then apply a DL semantic method for fast and adaptive floe instance segmentation from high-resolution airborne and satellite images. A post-processing algorithm is also proposed to refine the segmentation and further to derive acceptable floe size distributions at local and global scales.\n\nToward Long-Term Monitoring of Regional Permafrost Thaw with Satellite InSAR\n\nTaha Sadeghi Chorsi, Franz J. Meyer, and Timothy H. Dixon\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2605,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2605, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nActive layer, the soil or sediment layer above permafrost, thaws and freezes seasonally. The annual freeze-thaw cycle of the active layer causes significant surface height change. We estimate subsidence rate and active layer thickness (ALT) for part of northern Alaska’s permafrost zone for summer 2017 to 2022 using satellite radar interferometry and LiDAR. ALT estimates range from ~20 cm to larger than 150 cm. Subsidence rate varies ranging from ~3–20 cm/year during the thaw season.\n\nAnnual to seasonal glacier mass balance in High Mountain Asia derived from PlÃ©iades stereo images: examples from the Pamir and the Tibetan Plateau\n\nDaniel Falaschi, Atanu Bhattacharya, Gregoire Guillet, Lei Huang, Owen King, Kriti Mukherjee, Philipp Rastner, Tandong Yao, and Tobias Bolch\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5435–5458, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5435-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5435-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBecause glaciers are crucial freshwater sources in the lowlands surrounding High Mountain Asia, constraining short-term glacier mass changes is essential. We investigate the potential of state-of-the-art satellite elevation data to measure glacier mass changes in two selected regions. The results demonstrate the ability of our dataset to characterize glacier changes of different magnitudes, allowing for an increase in the number of inaccessible glaciers that can be readily monitored.\n\nSnow accumulation, albedo and melt patterns following road construction on permafrost, InuvikâTuktoyaktuk Highway, Canada\n\nJennika Hammar, Inge GrÃ¼nberg, Steven V. Kokelj, Jurjen van der Sluijs, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5357–5372, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoads on permafrost have significant environmental effects. This study assessed the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH) in Canada and its impact on snow accumulation, albedo and snowmelt timing. Our findings revealed that snow accumulation increased by up to 36 m from the road, 12-day earlier snowmelt within 100 m due to reduced albedo, and altered snowmelt patterns in seemingly undisturbed areas. Remote sensing aids in understanding road impacts on permafrost.\n\nCo-registration and residual correction of digital elevation models: a comparative study\n\nTao Li, Yuanlin Hu, Bin Liu, Liming Jiang, Hansheng Wang, and Xiang Shen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5299–5316, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5299-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5299-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRaw DEMs are often misaligned with each other due to georeferencing errors, and a co-registration process is required before DEM differencing. We present a comparative analysis of the two classical DEM co-registration and three residual correction algorithms. The experimental results show that rotation and scale biases should be considered in DEM co-registration. The new non-parametric regression technique can eliminate the complex systematic errors, which existed in the co-registration results.\n\nMorphodynamics of the Mont Blanc glaciers and their recent evolution\n\nFabrizio Troilo, NiccolÃ² Dematteis, Francesco Zucca, Martin Funk, and Daniele Giordan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2771,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2771, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne of the main features of glaciers is their movement along slopes. The study of this process is relevant in many aspects of glaciology. In the present study, optical satellite images of Mont Blanc were processed, obtaining surface velocities of 30 glaciers between 2016–2022. The study highlighted different behaviours and velocity variations that have relationships with the glacier morphology. An unexpected accelerating trend was observed, but its origin needs to be further investigated.\n\nOut-of-the-box calving-front detection method using deep learning\n\nOskar Herrmann, Nora Gourmelon, Thorsten Seehaus, Andreas Maier, Johannes J. FÃ¼rst, Matthias H. Braun, and Vincent Christlein\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4957–4977, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4957-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4957-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDelineating calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers in satellite images is a labour-intensive task. We propose a method based on deep learning that automates this task. We choose a deep learning framework that adapts to any given dataset without needing deep learning expertise. The method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset for calving-front detection and glacier zone segmentation. The framework can beat the benchmark baseline without major modifications.\n\nMapping the extent of giant Antarctic icebergs with deep learning\n\nAnne Braakmann-Folgmann, Andrew Shepherd, David Hogg, and Ella Redmond\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4675–4690, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4675-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4675-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we propose a deep neural network to map the extent of giant Antarctic icebergs in Sentinel-1 images automatically. While each manual delineation requires several minutes, our U-net takes less than 0.01 s. In terms of accuracy, we find that U-net outperforms two standard segmentation techniques (Otsu, k-means) in most metrics and is more robust to challenging scenes with sea ice, coast and other icebergs. The absolute median deviation in iceberg area across 191 images is 4.1 %.\n\nAllometric scaling of retrogressive thaw slumps\n\nJurjen van der Sluijs, Steven V. Kokelj, and Jon F. Tunnicliffe\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4511–4533, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4511-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4511-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is an urgent need to obtain size and erosion estimates of climate-driven landslides, such as retrogressive thaw slumps. We evaluated surface interpolation techniques to estimate slump erosional volumes and developed a new inventory method by which the size and activity of these landslides are tracked through time. Models between slump area and volume reveal non-linear intensification, whereby model coefficients improve our understanding of how permafrost landscapes may evolve over time.\n\nMapping Antarctic crevasses and their evolution with deep learning applied to satellite radar imagery\n\nTrystan Surawy-Stepney, Anna E. Hogg, Stephen L. Cornford, and David C. Hogg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4421–4445, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4421-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4421-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe presence of crevasses in Antarctica influences how the ice sheet behaves. It is important, therefore, to collect data on the spatial distribution of crevasses and how they are changing. We present a method of mapping crevasses from satellite radar imagery and apply it to 7.5 years of images, covering Antarctica's floating and grounded ice. We develop a method of measuring change in the density of crevasses and quantify increased fracturing in important parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n\nMeasuring the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth in subarctic environments using UASs â Part 1: Measurements, processing, and accuracy assessment\n\nAnssi Rauhala, Leo-Juhani MeriÃ¶, Anton Kuzmin, Pasi Korpelainen, Pertti Ala-aho, Timo Kumpula, BjÃ¸rn KlÃ¸ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4343–4362, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4343-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4343-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow conditions in the Northern Hemisphere are rapidly changing, and information on snow depth is important for decision-making. We present snow depth measurements using different drones throughout the winter at a subarctic site. Generally, all drones produced good estimates of snow depth in open areas. However, differences were observed in the accuracies produced by the different drones, and a reduction in accuracy was observed when moving from an open mire area to forest-covered areas.\n\nMeasuring the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth in subarctic environments using UASs â Part 2: Snow processes and snowâcanopy interactions\n\nLeo-Juhani MeriÃ¶, Anssi Rauhala, Pertti Ala-aho, Anton Kuzmin, Pasi Korpelainen, Timo Kumpula, BjÃ¸rn KlÃ¸ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4363–4380, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation on seasonal snow cover is essential in understanding snow processes and operational forecasting. We study the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth and snow processes in a subarctic, boreal landscape using drones. We identified multiple theoretically known snow processes and interactions between snow and vegetation. The results highlight the applicability of the drones to be used for a detailed study of snow depth in multiple land cover types and snow–vegetation interactions.\n\nEvaluating Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model emissivities with 89 to 243 GHz observations of Arctic tundra snow\n\nKirsty Wivell, Stuart Fox, Melody Sandells, Chawn Harlow, Richard Essery, and Nick Rutter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4325–4341, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite microwave observations improve weather forecasts, but to use these observations in the Arctic, snow emission must be known. This study uses airborne and in situ snow observations to validate emissivity simulations for two- and three-layer snowpacks at key frequencies for weather prediction. We assess the impact of thickness, grain size and density in key snow layers, which will help inform development of physical snow models that provide snow profile input to emissivity simulations.\n\nBrief communication: Identification of tundra topsoil frozen/thawed state from SMAP and GCOM-W1 radiometer measurements using the spectral gradient method\n\nKonstantin Muzalevskiy, Zdenek Ruzicka, Alexandre Roy, Michael Loranty, and Alexander Vasiliev\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4155–4164, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4155-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4155-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new all-weather method for determining the frozen/thawed (FT) state of soils in the Arctic region based on satellite data was proposed. The method is based on multifrequency measurement of brightness temperatures by the SMAP and GCOM-W1/AMSR2 satellites. The created method was tested at sites in Canada, Finland, Russia, and the USA, based on climatic weather station data. The proposed method identifies the FT state of Arctic soils with better accuracy than existing methods.\n\nNew estimates of pan-Arctic sea iceâatmosphere neutral drag coefficients from ICESat-2 elevation data\n\nAlexander Mchedlishvili, Christof LÃ¼pkes, Alek Petty, Michel Tsamados, and Gunnar Spreen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4103–4131, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4103-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4103-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we looked at sea ice–atmosphere drag coefficients, quantities that help with characterizing the friction between the atmosphere and sea ice, and vice versa. Using ICESat-2, a laser altimeter that measures elevation differences by timing how long it takes for photons it sends out to return to itself, we could map the roughness, i.e., how uneven the surface is. From roughness we then estimate drag force, the frictional force between sea ice and the atmosphere, across the Arctic.\n\nGLAcier Feature Tracking testkit (GLAFT): a statistically and physically based framework for evaluating glacier velocity products derived from optical satellite image feature tracking\n\nWhyjay Zheng, Shashank Bhushan, Maximillian Van Wyk De Vries, William Kochtitzky, David Shean, Luke Copland, Christine Dow, Renette Jones-Ivey, and Fernando PÃ©rez\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4063–4078, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4063-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4063-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe design and propose a method that can evaluate the quality of glacier velocity maps. The method includes two numbers that we can calculate for each velocity map. Based on statistics and ice flow physics, velocity maps with numbers close to the recommended values are considered to have good quality. We test the method using the data from Kaskawulsh Glacier, Canada, and release an open-sourced software tool called GLAcier Feature Tracking testkit (GLAFT) to help users assess their velocity maps.\n\nEvaluating the utility of active microwave observations as a snow mission concept using observing system simulation experiments\n\nEunsang Cho, Carrie M. Vuyovich, Sujay V. Kumar, Melissa L. Wrzesien, and Rhae Sung Kim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3915–3931, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3915-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3915-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs a future snow mission concept, active microwave sensors have the potential to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) in deep snowpack and forested environments. We used a modeling and data assimilation approach (a so-called observing system simulation experiment) to quantify the usefulness of active microwave-based SWE retrievals over western Colorado. We found that active microwave sensors with a mature retrieval algorithm can improve SWE simulations by about 20 % in the mountainous domain.\n\nRelevance of warm air intrusions for Arctic satellite sea ice concentration time series\n\nPhilip Rostosky and Gunnar Spreen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3867–3881, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3867-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3867-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring winter, storms entering the Arctic region can bring warm air into the cold environment. Strong increases in air temperature modify the characteristics of the Arctic snow and ice cover. The Arctic sea ice cover can be monitored by satellites observing the natural emission of the Earth's surface. In this study, we show that during warm air intrusions the change in the snow characteristics influences the satellite-derived sea ice cover, leading to a false reduction of the estimated ice area.\n\nObserving the evolution of summer melt on multiyear sea ice with ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2\n\nEllen M. Buckley, SinÃ©ad L. Farrell, Ute C. Herzfeld, Melinda A. Webster, Thomas Trantow, Oliwia N. Baney, Kyle A. Duncan, Huilin Han, and Matthew Lawson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3695–3719, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3695-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3695-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use satellite observations to investigate the evolution of melt ponds on the Arctic sea ice surface. We derive melt pond depth from ICESat-2 measurements of the pond surface and bathymetry and melt pond fraction (MPF) from the classification of Sentinel-2 imagery. MPF increases to a peak of 16 % in late June and then decreases, while depth increases steadily. This work demonstrates the ability to track evolving melt conditions in three dimensions throughout the summer.\n\nCast shadows reveal changes in glacier surface elevation\n\nMonika Pfau, Georg Veh, and Wolfgang Schwanghart\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3535–3551, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3535-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3535-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCast shadows have been a recurring problem in remote sensing of glaciers. We show that the length of shadows from surrounding mountains can be used to detect gains or losses in glacier elevation.\n\nAutoTerm: an automated pipeline for glacier terminus extraction using machine learning and a âbig dataâ repository of Greenland glacier termini\n\nEnze Zhang, Ginny Catania, and Daniel T. Trugman\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3485–3503, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3485-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3485-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacier termini are essential for studying why glaciers retreat, but they need to be mapped automatically due to the volume of satellite images. Existing automated mapping methods have been limited due to limited automation, lack of quality control, and inadequacy in highly diverse terminus environments. We design a fully automated, deep-learning-based method to produce termini with quality control. We produced 278 239 termini in Greenland and provided a way to deliver new termini regularly.\n\nCharacterizing the surge behaviour and associated ice-dammed lake evolution of the Kyagar Glacier in the Karakoram\n\nGuanyu Li, Mingyang Lv, Duncan J. Quincey, Liam S. Taylor, Xinwu Li, Shiyong Yan, Yidan Sun, and Huadong Guo\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2891–2907, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2891-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2891-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKyagar Glacier in the Karakoram is well known for its surge history and its frequent blocking of the downstream valley, leading to a series of high-magnitude glacial lake outburst floods. Using it as a test bed, we develop a new approach for quantifying surge behaviour using successive digital elevation models. This method could be applied to other surge studies. Combined with the results from optical satellite images, we also reconstruct the surge process in unprecedented detail.\n\nCited articles"
