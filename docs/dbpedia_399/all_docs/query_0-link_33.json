        "text": "This study investigates the elemental composition, organic carbon content, pH values, and particle size characteristics in 50 road dust samples collected from Tyumen, a large city in Western Siberia (Russia). The content of 62 major and trace elements was studied using atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) и inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was revealed that the dust has an alkaline reaction pH = 7.4–10.2 and low organic carbon content (0.07–2.9%). The grain size distribution of the road dust samples revealed that the predominant grain size fraction was of 100–250 μm. The content of small particles (PM2 and PM10) representing the greatest environmental hazard is minimal on roads with an average traffic intensity. Studies have shown that the main road dust pollutants in Tyumen are Ni, Sb, Cr, Zn, and Co. The average geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values are ranked as Ni (2.2) > Sb (1.5) > Cr (1.3) > Zn (0.4) > Co (0.4) > Cu (0.2). The contamination evaluation through enrichment factor (EF) calculation showed that road dust is highly enriched in Ni and significantly in Cr and Sb. More than 80% of Zn, Co, and Cu and more than 90% of Ni, Sb, and Cr come from anthropogenic sources. The average concentration of Ni and Cr in the road dust of Tyumen is one order of magnitude higher than in other cities of the Earth where similar studies were carried out. The high Ni content is associated with the composition of local soils and roadways, increased content in vehicle exhaust gasses, and abrasion of metal parts. Calculations of the total enrichment index Ze showed that the level of road dust pollution in most of Tyumen’s territory is hazardous.\n\nThe chemical and particle size composition of road dust in Surgut, which is a rapidly developing city in Western Siberia, was studied for the first time. Contents of major and trace elements were determined using ICP-MS and ICP-AES, respectively. It was found that the road dust had an alkaline pH (from 7.54 to 9.38) and that the particle size composition was dominated by the 100–250-μm fraction. The contamination assessment based on calculations of the enrichment factor (EF) showed that the road dust was significantly enriched in Sb and Cu and moderately enriched in Zn, Pb, Mo, Ni and W. The sources of these elements are probably associated with the abrasion of car tires and brake pads. Based on calculations of global pollution index (PIr) and total enrichment factor (Ze), the road dust of Surgut was characterized by a generally low level of potential ecological risk, except for stretches of road subject to regular traffic jams, where a moderate ecological risk level was identified. In comparison to the other Russian cities (Moscow, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, etc.) where studies of road dust composition have been carried out, Surgut had similar contents of Cr and Cu and relatively lower contents of Sb, Cd, As and Pb.\n\nRoad dust is a composite substance formed due to wear of different components of transport infrastructure and motor vehicles. In 2017, 214 road dust samples were collected in Moscow to analyze pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and organic carbon (C оrg ) content that controls the ability of dust to fix pollutants. The road dust was dominated by sand and silt size particles (the share of PM 10 particles varies from 2.3% to 39%) and had alkaline pH (6.4–8.1), high EC (33–712 μS/cm) and C оrg (0.17–6.7%). The road dust is alkalinized by detergents and particles formed by abrasion of roadways and blown out from construction sites. A three-fold excess of the EC over the background values (dust in parks) is mainly due to the use of the de-icing agents and roadway maintenance. But the concentration of C оrg in the Moscow’s road dust is on average 2 times lower compared to the background values; the increased content of C оrg in the courtyards is associated with the application of organic fertilizers. The most significant factor that determines the physicochemical properties of the dust was the type of a road. The dust on large roads including the Third Ring Road had higher pH (7.0–8.0) and EC (98–712 μS/ cm); it contained higher proportions of the fine particle-size fractions compared to other roads. The C оrg content in the road dust was minimum on Moscow’s major radial highways due to the insignificant contribution of soil particles. The spatial trends in variability of the physicochemical properties of the dust in Moscow were not evident as they were to a large extent masked by other factors: proximity to industrial zones and large forest parks, differences in the de-icing agents used, unequal frequencies of road cleaning, and the various contribution of soil particles that vary in composition and genesis in different parts of Moscow.\n\nA study on the composition of snow allowed for a quantitative determination of pollutants deposited from the atmosphere. Concentrations of dissolved (<0.45 μm) and particulate fractions of 62 chemical elements were determined by ICP–MS and ICP–AES in 41 samples of snow from Tyumen (Russia). The background sites were characterized by a predominance of the dissolved phase of elements, except for Al, Sn, Cr, Co and Zr. The increased concentrations of dissolved Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, As and Mo can be explained by a long-range atmospheric transport from the sources located in the Urals. The urban sites showed multiple increases in particulate depositions and a predominance of the particulate phase, with a high degree of enrichment in many heavy metals. Sources of trace elements were determined according to the enrichment factor (EF). Highly enriched elements (Pb, Sb, Cd, Ag, Mo, As, Zn and Cu) with an EF > 100 were emitted from anthropogenic sources. According to the potential ecological risk index (RI), the worst ecological conditions were identified in Tyumen’s historical center, industrial zone and along roads with the heaviest traffic. The data obtained in the present study allowed us to identify the most polluted parts of the city, which are located in the center and along the roads with the most intensive traffic. This research could offer a reference for the atmospheric pollution prevention and control in Tyumen.\n\nIslamabad Expressway is one of the busiest roads in the capital of Pakistan. For the assessment of heavy metal pollution level in dust generated on the Expressway, 13 samples of dust were collected from various places around the highway and four samples of soil were obtained from the undisturbed green land in Islamabad. The samples were analyzed for five heavy metals using FAAS (flame atomic absorption spectrometry). The average concentration values of the metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were found to be 5 ± 1, 52 ± 18, 23 ± 6, 104 ± 29 and 116 ± 35 mg kg- 1 respectively, which were generally lower than the values cited in literature. The inter-elemental correlation of Cu and Pb indicated that they belonged to common anthropogenic sources. The pollution level was estimated based on the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), the pollution index (PI), and the integrated pollution index (IPI). The values of IPI were in the following order: Cu > Pb > Zn > Cd > Ni. All the indices for the metals under consideration were either low or corresponded to middle level of pollution. The pollution level is expected to increase due to rapid urbanization of the area. Some protective measures have therefore been proposed."
