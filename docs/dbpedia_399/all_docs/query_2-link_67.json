These chapters� Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters, particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, are produced selectively. For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready references publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. A:6,Nough detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will cont;nue to be available as long as the major portion of the study is considered valid. A chin terly listing of cll active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available ills Pt,blications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and dute of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units a:, well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additiL .al copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through lirjison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NiS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee.

Appraisal (C) The transportation and telecommunications (telecom) systems of the U.S.S.R. have not vet reached a stage of adequac for all sectors of the national economy and are undergoing improvements in varying degrees. The transportation industry, in particular, is suffering from poor bureaucratic planning and inept operating practices. Major developments in telecommunications and in virtually every mode of transportation are taking place through the governments continuing Five Year Plans. Progress in the growth and development of better facilities, however, is perhaps at a rate slower than Soviet planners anticipate or desire. The continental expanse of the Soviet Union, with its vast areas of sparse population and much of its terrain and climate hostile to the construction and maintenance of transport and telecom facilities, is apparently the main hindrance to this progress. Development of transportation and telecom facilities is especiall difficult or virtually impossible in the Siberian Arctic and sub- Arctic regions where foundations are seasonally unstable because of swamps, permafrost, and miry tundra soils. Distribution of the transportation and telecom systerns is uneven. The hest developed and most heavily utilized portions of these systems lie in European U.S.S.R. with Moscow\" as it focal point; in sharp contrast, the remaining area (approximately 60% of the U.S.S.R.) is serviced by a sparse pattern of transport routes and telecorn facilities (Figure 35). The 'For diacritics on place names sec the list of names on the apron of the Terrain and \"transportation map amt the nwp itself. east -west oriented Trans- Siberian rail line (Omsk to Vladivostok) provides the sole overland connecting link between the eastern and western transportation networks. In European U.S.S.R. the railroads and highways, and to a lesser extent the waterways, parallel each other in many areas. In the central and eastern parts of the U.S.S. R. the transportation lines tend to form it complementary pattern; this is especially characteristic of the central Soviet regions where several north south oriented giant river systems feed into the Tracts- Siberian rail route from the north, while it number of roads connect with the railroad from border connections to the south. Except for the lack of rail connections with Norway, overland international connections via rail or highway are made with all adjacent countries. Inland waterways provide direct connections only with Communist China, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Iran, Romania, Poland, and Finland; however, the inland fleet, using its river /seagoing vessels in combination with smaller river craft can navigate to the remaining adjacent countries via the Black Sea or the Danube River. The transportation and telecom systems are state owned and are controlled by various ministries of the Soviet bweaucracy. Traditionally, government policies have favored the development of railroads as the backbone of the overall surface transportation complex. As a result, the nations transportation system lacks the desired balance and coon dinaEon between the various modes, the railroads are overburdened, waterways are underutilized, and roads are qualitatively underdeveloped. There are, however, manifestations of it gradual change in government emphasis relative to transportation facilities. Soviet APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA -RDP01 -00707 R000200090035 -8 rail managers are increasingly siphoning off more of the traffic normally handled by rail to other modes the passengers to air or bus transport, and sonic freight to rivers, trucks, and pipelines. In line with this trend, the government is gradnally expanding its autonwtive industry, paving more roads, enlarging truck and port terminals, and constructing more pipelines. Over the years the railroads have continually outperformed all other modes of transport combined, in terms of long -haul traffic. This dominance is reflected in statistics for 1972 which indicate that of the total 2,193.1 billion short- tun -miles accomplished by the three major surface transportation modes, railroad, accounted for over 86` %f', highways SSA, and inland waterways less than 65( The railroads are also the chief means of passenger travel and, although their share of this traffic has been declining, in 1972 accounted for over 60% of the passengers transported. The highway system, while more extensive than the railroads and waterways, is only 15Si paved. Used mainly for short -haul and feeder services, motor transport is gradually assuming r.uore of the rail short distance traffic, and trucking now accounts for over Wi, of the freight moved by surface transport facilities. Soviet inland waterways, despite their limited areal distribution and lack of east -west oriented routes, are growing in importance to the national eccnomy� especially in the movement of raxw materials to developing industries. An expanding river /seagoing fleet is increasing the international- traffic capability of inland waterway vessels. The rapidly growing pipeline system is in important adjunct to the other surface transport modes but remains inadequate for national requirements �the oil industry still relying on rail and waterway carriers for the transport of significant amounts of crude ail to refineries and industrial consumers; in 1972, for example, the railroads accounted for about 44.551 of the total petroleum transported. Cavil air transport accounts for a comparatively small amount of domestic passenger and cargo traffic but is nevertheless significant for long distance travel and for providing services to isolated communities of the interior that are not reached by other nodes of transportation. Aeroflot, the sole Soviet civil airline, is the world's largest and flies to 66 countries in all continents except Australia. The Aeroflot fleet is estimated to total over 7,700 aircraft, most of .which are light aircraft including helicopters and special purpose types used for training or utility and liaison services. The civil air fleet is not expected to expand further; the probability is rather the opposite since the current trend is to replace Aeroflot's lighter aircraft with modern aircraft of greater capacities. Airfields in the Soviet Union are fairly well (list rihuted and adequately serve the needs of both commercial and military aircraft. The Soviet merchant marine, which early in 1973 ranked fifth in number of ships and eighth in dead-weight tonnage among the merchant fleets of the world, plies shipping routes reaching over 100 countries. Expansion of the fleet has slowed in recent years in contrast to the rapid rate of ship acquisition during the 1960'x; this slowdown may be attributed in part to the governments efforts to develop prototypes of more sophisticated ships, and also to the increasing exportation of Soviet -built vessels. Soviet seaborne trade, which it is estimated totaled 150 million tons in 1972, is supported by some 180 major and minor ports adequately distrihnted along the various seacoasts. Of growing signfficancc is the establishment of container facilities at some of the mayor ports. The Soviet telecom complex is basically extensive and comparable in many respects to systems found in the more advanced nations of the ,world. But satisfactory telecom services are still lacking in many communities; for example, on a per capita basis there are now only about five general- purpose telephones per 100 persons. The government is, however, airing to establish a modern and versatile telecom system for the entire country. The Soviets current live Year Plan (1971 -75) has provided for significant improvements to the transportation and telecom systems. Among the major projects underway or planned are the following: Railroads� construction of some new lines, double tracking the remaining single -track trunk lines, ac- quisition of some new motive power and rolling stock, expansion of electrification. Highways Increasing the amount of paved routes, construction of bypasses or circumferential highways around some major cities, establishment of more fueling and repair stations, improving truck terminals. Inland waterways� Expansion of some of the port facilities, development of new ports, installation of new handling equipment especially for container operations, continue modernization of the river fleet. Maritime ports Development of some new ports; improve existing facilities including reconstruction of wharves and construction of special berths for container ships; modernization and expansion of several shipyards. Merchant marine Continue fleet modernization, ac- quisition of 550 new ships. Pipelines� Construction of additional crude -oil lines, extensic,n of CEMA Friendship) system. Civil Air Replacement of older aircraft with larger, modern types; expansion of international services. Telecommunications Modernization and expansion of facilities including new intercity communications and TV relay networks, automation of intercity telegraph and telephone facilities, expansion of local telephone services, improve broadcasting facilities, expand color TV.

Strategic mobility (S) The transportation systems of the U.S.S.R. could provide substantial support for it,tcrnal military logistical operations, but any large -scale movement of forces would be severely limited by the uneven areal distribution of routes, physical deficiencies of the networks, and various en', ironmental factors. Regionally, European U. S. S. R., which has the heaviest concentration of overland routes, affords military forces the greatest degree of mobilih�; in contrast the sparsity of the surface transport networks elsewhere in the U. S. S. R. would i,nposc severe limitations on force movements. Owing to the enormity of the U.S.S.R., great distances would generally be involved in tilt� movement of troops and supplies, specially if logistical support lines had to extend from European U.S.S.R. to the central and far eastern regions. The railroads would be the mainstay of any internal overland militim supple movement, with the highways and inland waterways playing supplemen- tim roles. The most strategic and high capacity rail lines are those extending frorn Moscow and Leningrad to the Baltic and Black Sea areas, those that afford international connections with neighboring countries, and the \"Trans- `;;berian line and its extensions. Because of many bridge crossings, most of the cast -west rail trunk lines are highly vulnerable to interdiction. Except for i\"inland and Mongolia, cross border movement from the U.S.S.R. into the adjacent countries is cotttPlicated by the differences in rail gages, which necessitate transloading delays of up to 6 hours for troop trains moving with equipment. The capability of the highway systern to support major militar operations is seve�rcly limited by the insufficient number of paved arterial routes. Most roads are inferior types having low supporting characteristics. European U.S.S.R., which has the greatest density of roads and most of the paved mileage, affords considerable flexibility of movement for motorized forces. In the central and eastern regions of the country, the sparse and poor quality roaelnets have extremely limited capacities, and road movement for large -scale military operations would be generally confined to deployment to or from railheads along the \"Trans- Siberian rail route. Like the railroads, the major points of interdiction on the roadnet are the bridges over the nunerous watercourses. The Caucasus, the Urals, and otber mountainous regions are also areas where motor convovs would be vulnerable to interdiction. Adverse climatic conditions �hcayy snws, ice conditions, freezing temperatures, the spring thaw, and seasonal rains and floods �would seriously hamper overland military operations. The inland waterway system provides an important, but slower, means of transporting both troops and supplies. Because of military exigencies, Soviet waterways probable would play it minor role in any initial reinforcement or logistical movement; howcycr, over a prolonged supple and resupply period of operations, they could serve as effective long distance lines of communication over which large tonnages of military equipment and supplies� including 1`01,� could be transported at it sustained rate of delivery. The major Soviet waterways arc amply equipped with night navigational aids allowing for 24 -hour operations and have relatively modern river fleets and port facilities, some of which could be readily made available for military use. Soviet inland witterway cargo craft are capable of transporting various types of military bardware and supplies including such items as tracked vehicles, armored trucks, personnel carriers, missiles, and components loo large: for transport by other modes. Additionally, nuncrous units of the inlauid fleet could easily be converted into hospital ships, troop carriers, antiaircraft barges, patrol craft, and minesweepers. The Greater Volga waterways system provides extensive high- capacity routes for logistical movements from interior points deep within European U.S.S.R. to maritime and river ports along the Baltic, White, Black, and Caspian Seas where cargoes would, as necessary, be transloaded to oceangoing vessels and traussbipped to overland modes of transportation. A major weakness of the inland waterways system is the winter ice conditions. which prevent navigation for periods of from 2 to 9 months �these periods depending on the geographic locale. Serious interdiction or complete stoppat *,c to through traffic movements could be achieved by destruction of the vulnerable dam and lock installations. TlIv Soviet merchant fleet would provide substantial scalift logistic support for military operations: its cargo vessels have it combined lift capability of more than 7.8 million long tons, and its passenger ships excluding the combination car- go; lrssenger hypes �could transport over 24,000 troops. Tile 278 merchant tanker vessels could provide for it scalift of over -1.5 million tons of POI.. \"file maritime interregional scalift capability could be asgnuvthed by the inland waterways river /seagoing fleet of From S00 to -100 vessels whose capacities range APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090036 -8 from 1,850 to 5,000 tons; additionally, vessels of the sizeable fishing fleet could be converted to carry troops and military equipment. The maritime fleet is adequately dispersed in the Baltic and Black Seas and along the coasts of the Arctic and Far East regions. Marine movement is restricted in some areas especially along the Arctic seacoast� during seasonal periods of fast ice conditions. Mobilization of Aeroflot personnel and equipment for military purposes would entail relatively minor technical and administrative adjustments. The carrier's military potential is enhanced by the fact that many of the different types of Soviet manufactured transport aircraft are in common use by both military and civil aviation. Transition from a civil to a military role would require only minor modifications. In addition, a substantial number of Aeroflot flight personnel are reservists in the air forces, and all employees are believed to hold mobilization assignments. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and several of his deputies are military officers. Personnel and equipment of civil airfields, air traffic control centers, and aircraft maintenance and overhaul bases are readily available and provide equipped installations for rapid conversion to military use. If all heavy and medium transports in the civil fleet were made available to the military, it is estimated that military cargo airlift capability would increase by 25% and troop airlift more than double. Most Aeroflot aircraft are not particularly well suited for military use because they are not rear loading and cannot be used for the transport of large vehicles. However, nearly all of them could be �and on several occasions some have been �used for transporting troops. The telecom systems could adequately support military operations. Owing to the many facilities available for alternate routing and the special measures taken to protect telecom systems, total disruption of services by military action would be difficult. C. Railroads (S) The 81,500 -route -mile U.S.S.R. railroad network, owned and operated by the government, occupies the primary position in the Soviet transportation industry, handling most of the long -haul freight transportation. In many areas the railroads are hard- pressed to handle freight traffic requirements, particularly during the harvest seasons. To cape with the problem, the government is investing heavily iii modernizing railroads and equipment and in constructing new lines. The present network� compared with the U.S. 212,000- route -mile system� comprises the second largest railroad complex in the world. Most of the trackage is in the west; eastward the network gradually becomes a series of individual lines running to Siberia, Central Asia, and the Soviet Far East. The network density is lower than that of any other developed country in the world �only 0.96 mile of mainline track per 100 square miles of territory. Moscow, the largest rail center, has 11 lines radiating in all directions and is served by two circumferential lines. Foremost among other rail centers are Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk. The highest freight densities occur on lines joining the Donets Basin with Moscow, Leningrad, and regions of the Ukraine, and on those connecting the Kuznetsk Basin with the Ural mountains. The highest freight flow intensity on a single line is probably that along the Omsk Novosibirsk sector of the Trans Siberian railroad. The gage of the track on most Soviet railroads is 5'0\" as compared to standard gage (-1'8'/2 used in the United States and most of the other countries of the world. Most narrow -gage trackage on the Russian mainland is 2'i 1 gage, and the relatively small network on the island of Sakhalin is predominately 3'6\" gage. As of 1 January 1973, the mainland network totaled 81,506 route -miles of which 82,269 miles were broad -gage lines and 2,237 miles narrow gage. About 72% of the broad -gage net is single track; most of the remainder is double track. Roughly 26% of the network is electrified (Figure 1), and about 61 uses mostly diesel traction. Steam traction, in use in only 13% of the system, is disappearing rapidly. International connections are made with the rail systems of all adjacent countries except Norway. Afghanistan has no rail system, but the border is crossed by a short broad -gage extension of a U.S.S.R. branch line. Except for the 5'0\" -gage networks of Finland and Mongolia, all international connections are with standard -gage (4'8 systems and transloading is necessary. The 24 change -of -gage points connecting the U.S.S.r.. rail network with the systems of the Eastern European Communist countries use the densest concentration of transloading facilities in the world. Other transloading sites are located on both sides of borders with Turkey, Iran, Communist China, and Nor Korea. All goods moving through the transloading zones usually must be transferred to the cars of the receiving country since rolling stock trucks are interchanged only on relatively few freight cars and on certain Russian passenger coaches. Development work on an automatic dual -gage wheelset, carried on for many years, may have been discontinued.

Rail operations are affected by great variations in climate, ranging from the winters of Siberia to the subtropical summers of Turkestan. Snow clearance during the long winters is often it m: for problem. Characteristics of selected principal rail 1. 's are tabulated in Figure 2 and the lines are shown on Figure 31. The standard rail is of the T- section type the R -50 (103.8 pounds per yard), R -65 (130.8 pounds per yard), and the R -75 (151.4 pounds per yard) are the principal rails used on main lines. Lighter rails, ranging from 67.4 to 87.8 pounds per yard, are used elsewhere. Rails are produced by Soviet rolling mills in lengths of -11 and fit feet. For \"seamless track the 82- foot .rails are prewelded into 2,625 foot lengths. Wooden crossties predominate and continue to be used throughout the system, prestressed reinforced concrete ties, which are preferred, are used in most new mainline constriction and in reconstruction of important routes. As of 1 January 1973, roughly 10,000 miles of line had been placed on concrete ties. Because of nume waterw the railroad system has many bridges. Steel -truss construction is most common for large- hridges, and steel girder and concrete slat) for smaller hridges. Double -trick bridges are uncommof., in following a generally worldwide practice, the Soviet rail planners add second tracks (and second hridges) only when increased traffic justifies the expenditure. 'funnels are !ocated mostly in the Caucasus and Sayan Mountains, on the Trans Siberian line sections around southern Lake Baikal, and between Ulan -Ude and Khabarovsk. The Amur river tunnel at Khabarovsk, built as a backup facility for the single -track bridge situated just south, is the only known underwater railroad tunnel in the U.S.S.R. Railroad ferries cross the Amur (Kom- somol'sk -na- Amore- Pivan'), the Caspian Sea (Baku Krasnovodsk), and Kerch* strait (K.rym- Kavkaz). Longstanding plans call for additional routes +cross the Caspian and for a connection with the island of Sakhalin (Sovetskaya Cavan- Kholmsk). The nianual -block sy stem of train control is employed on about 60 of the bread -gage network; automatic block, supplemented by Centralized Traffic Control, is used on about 33,600 route miles, including the most important lines. Locomotives operating within automatic -block territory are usually equipped with call signals and automatic- train -stop devices. The principal means of rails )ad communications is the telephone; all railroad stations are connected t)v an independent railroad telephone network, and a separate telephone system enables the Ministry to sat up conferences with the 26 regional railroads. Strategically placed radio stations supplement the telephone lines and serve as backup facilities in the event of line failure. Most Soviet locomotives are powered by diesel fuel or electricity. The relatively few steam locomotives still in service use mazut (a petroleum residual) or coal. Provision of water presents no difficulty. In 1972 the railroads carried 3,477.7 million short tons of freight and producz:r! 1,891.4 billion ton miles. During the same year they carried 3,053.4 million passengers and produced 170.6 billion passenger miles. Suburban passengers, mostly commuters, purchased about 90% of all tickets sold and accounted for approximately 27% of the passenger miles. In 1970 gross and net weights of freight trains amounted to 2,837.3 and 1,611.5 short tons, respectively; freight car turnaround was 5.5 days, and the average length of haul was 535 miles. Chief commodities normally transported are coal and coke, petroleum, ores, ferrous metal products, lumber and other building materials, and grain. 5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 FIG:'tE 1.

Steam locomotives, now used on low density lines and as switchers, move only 3.5% of the rail hauled freight. Although Soviet produced locomotives are technically somewhat inferior, the inventory is generally adequate to handle traffic re(Iuirements. Production of electric locomotives is concentrated at plants in Novocherkassk and Tbilisi, which have an annual combined output of 300 units. Diesel production: is concentrated tit Kharkov, Voro- shilovgrad, and Kolomna, with a combined annual production of about 1,500 units. Additional locomotives (mo electric), are imported from France (Figure 3). E ast Germany, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. At the beginning of 1972 the freight car inventory wtaled about 1.2 million units. The (I'nality of freight ca-' is somewhat inadequate, and the quantity does not me; present -day demands. Approximately 9550 of the fleet consists of 4 -axle (or snore) cars; all cars have automatic couplers and airhrakes. Domestic production of freight cars amounts to about 64,000 units annually; builders are located throughout the country, but the larger plants are at Nizi niy \"Tagil, Atltayskaya. 'Lhdanov (hunk cars), and Kryukov. Container shipping between Japan and Western Europe via the Trans Siberian Railroad is increasing steadily and is expected to nnushro;w.i during div next few years. According to the Soi irts, such traffic amounted to 3,000 containers dwing the first half of 1972, a figure which is expected to grow to between 15,000 and 20,000 units during 1973. Container transfer yards have been established in Moscow, Leningr [crest, and other areas. About 80% of all Soviet containers have capacities of .3 tons or less, but larger units are being used increasingly with development of modern facilities. Experimental flatcars are available to transport 10- and 20 -ton containers. Most of the passenger cars a.e built tit Kaliningrad, Riga, and Leningrad. All -metal cars comprise most of the total fleet, which has 2-, 3 and 4 -axle cars. Most of the 2 -axle equipment is in service on suburban lines, and the heavier equipment on Ivrig- distance routes. Electric (Figure 4) and aicscl multiple -unit trains are used for local and commuter service within large metropolitan enters. The Soviet railroads am divided into 26 regional systems functioning as independent units under the Ministry of Railways. The railroads had 2,337,000 employees in 1971, of whom 2,013,000 were classified as operating personnel. Considerable attention is given to research, education, and training. The Central Scientific Institute of Railroad Transportation, located just south of Moscow, is probably the largest and most advanced railroad instihnte in the c:rumtry. About 14 institutes offer degrees in railroad engineering, and other railroad schools provide job training as well as basic educational courses. The current Five Year Plan (1971 -75) calls for further dieselization and electrification, double tracking the remaining single -track trunk routes, acquiring new motive power and rolling stock, installing modern signaling, and construction of sonic new lines. The 'Tyumen- Surgut route, one of the most important construction projects underway in Western Siberia, will provide service front a major oil producing region in the northern part of the Tyumen Oblast. Presently completed to it point north of FIGURE 3.

ER -1 electric train- set (U /OU) Tobolsk, the line %will eventually cross the Oh River at Surgrat and run eastward along; the Oh to terminate at Nizhnevartovskiy. The Central Siberian and South Siberian railroads probably will be completed by 197.3 and should provide considerable relief for the highly overworked Trans- Siberian line in this area. The Central Siberian line, originating north of Rarnaul at the Talmenka junction, runs west through Karasuk, Kokelhetov, Kustanay, and terminates at Dzhetygara. The South Siberian Railroad, originating on the 'Trans- Siberian line at Tayshet and running west through Abakan, Novokuznetsk, Tsclinograd, and Kartaly to Mag- nitogorsk, is to be extended to Chishmy, on the Moscow- Kurgan trunk -Dote. After several years of delay, the Soviets have started work on the highly difficult task of bridging the Amur River between Komsomol sk -na -Amore and Pivan in the Far East. The structure, when completed, not only will elieiinate the need for train ferry operations across the Arnor, but also will obviate the custom, in winter, of laying tracks across the frozen river. D. Highways (S) highway transport is used primarily for short -haul movement of freight and passengers, and provides a feeder and distribution service to other modes of transport. Long distance international and domestic intenirh;ni trucking exist on several routes, but the amount of freight hauled in these operations is coanpor:,tively small. The average length of haul is slightly over 9 miles. In 1972 trucks carried 18.8 billion short tons of freight and produced 178 hillion ton miles. Quantitatively, the road network is generally adequate to meet current economic requirements. In terms of quality, however, the network is deficient; over 84% of the total mileage comprises loose- or natural- surface roads. The unevenly distributed national network ranges from a relatively dense net in European U.S.S.R. to a very s .arse network in Asiatic U.S. S.R. Most paved or improv -rd roads are located in the central and western parts of European U.S.S.R and along the southern border. The north central and northeastern regions of the country have few roads. The Pacific oastal region and Sakhalin island are served by sev(,ril improved r,; .ids. No continuous paved road crosses the entire country in an east -west direction. The U.S.S.R. road network makes connections with all bordering countries. The network density of slightly less than 0.1 -rile of road per square mile of area is less than the densities in countries along the western border; about equal to neighboring Communist China, Mongolia, North Korea, and 'l'urkey; and greater than that of Iran and Afghanistan. From the standpoint of duality, the countries along the western border have superior roads, while the countries along the southern horder have equal or inferior roads. In 1971 the U.S.S.R. had 845,618 miles of roads. A breakdown of this mileage by surface type: is as follows: PERCENT SURFACE MILES OF'IOTAL Paved concrete; bituminous, includ- ing surface treatment; stone block; cobblestone) 128,340 15.2 Crashed stone, gravel 188,852 22.3 Earth including tracks) 528,426 62.5 U.S.S.

Republic roads are main or secondary routes which connect the main administra- tive, political, and economic centers of autonrmous republics, krays, and oblasts within a union republic. Roads of oblast, kray, or autonomous republic importance are short distance routes which connect important areas within an oblast, kray, or autonomous republic. Local roads link rayon centers, rural settlements, villages, and state and collective farms. Although the administrative classification of roads does not signify any particular type of road construction, the all -union roads are generally paved, these routes comprising less than 10% of the total network. Most main routes in European U.S.S.R. have bituminous surfaces (Figure 5) 16 to 23 feet wide, with 3- to 10 -foot earth or gravel shoulders. Other main routes have surfaces 30 to 40 feet wide. Four -lane divided highways total about 500 miles, including the 68 -mile Moscow circumferential highway, the Kaunas to Vilnyus highway, and approaches to some large urban areas. In Asiatic U.S.S.R. most main routes are constructed of crushed stone or gravel and are 16 to 20 feet wide. Bituminous surfaced roads 18 to 20 feet wide connect the more important cities in Soviet ':antral Asia. These roads generally have a surface thickness of less than 2 inches laid on a crushed stone, gravel, or sand base 10 to 20 inches thick, depending on the condition and type of subsoil. The surface of gravel roads in areas of stable soil and good drainage usually consists of 2 inches of gravel and sand; elsewhere the gravel or crushed stone roads range in thickness from 4 to 12 inches and have a base of large rocks, slag, or rubble. Improved earth roads are usually constructed by grading and rolling the natural surface. Earth shoulders are predominant throughout the roads network, but the better roads have gravel shoulders from 3 to 10 feet wide. Because of the flat to rolling terrain in European U.S.S.R., roads there have gentle curves and grades, while in the Caucasus and the mountainous southern border areas many roads have steep grades and sharp curves. Information is riot available on the total number of road bridges in the U.S.S.R. Timber bridges, although common on secondary and local roads, are gradually being replaced by prefabricated, reinforced- concrete, deck -type structures. Steel bridges are used mainly in large urban areas and at wide -gap river crossings. In several of the cities there are doubled. combination rail- highway bridges. Load capacities of bridges vary 12 considerably; recently constructed reinforced- concrete bridges have load capacities of about 66 short tons under controlled speeds and spacing of vehicles; however, low capacity bridges (less than 10 short tons) still exist on many roads. Reinforced- concrete, steel, and masonry bridges are in fair to good condition; the timber bridges are generally in poor condition. There are few road tunnels and galleries, and the small number of ferries and fords are usually limited to secondary roac`. crossings. known tunnels and galleries are of reinforced concrete construction. Ferry craft vary from cable- operated barges with capacities of one or two vehicles to modern, diesel- powered craft each with a capacity of at least 25 vehicles. Characteristics of selected principal highway routes are tabulated in Figure 6; the routes are shown on Figure 32. Road construction and maintenance activities are government controlled. The Main Administration for Highway Construction (Glavdorstroy), subordinate to the Ministry of Transport Construction, is responsible for the planning, design, and construction of all -union roads and any others of military significance. Planning and construction of the other roads, as well as road maintenance, is carried out by units of the Ministry of Motor Transport and Highways in each republic, with subordinate directorates at kray and oblast levels. In addition. some industries and enterprises build and maintain roads to serve their own needs. Roads are constructed by highly mechanized groups assigned to specific road construction districts. Road maintenance and repair are performed by units (Road Repair Points) of 25 to 35 men, each unit being responsible for sectors 30 to 55 miles in length. Supplementary sources of labor include military personnel and members of collective and state farms, industrial enterprises, and other economic organiza- tions. In general, roads are slowly and poorly constructed. Many problems bar effective and efficient road construction and maintenance. There is a general shortage of appropriated funds, road construction materia,ls, roadbuilding equipment, and skilled personnel. Moreover, mountainous terrain, unstable soils, and poor drainage hinder cons' suction and maintenance in many areas. Road construction materials, in particular suitable gravel and crushed rock, are in short suppiv in some parts of the country and must be transported to construction sites �at times by rail over long distances. Bituminous materials are available in a .equate amounts; Portland cement, although sufficient in quantity, is used only in the construction of especially important roads.

Each of the 15 union republics has a Ministry of Motor Vehicle Transport, or similarly named organization, which controls and regulates motor transport activities including the hauling of passengers and various kinds of freight for state and public and cooperative organizations. Bus lines connect most popuiated centers. Several motor transport organizations are engaged in international haulage tinder the trade name Sovtransavto. Truck lines connect the U.S.S.R. with the Mongolian People's Republic, Afghanistan, Iran, 'Turkey, Finland, the Eastern European Warsaw Pact Countries, and France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Although rapid industrial growth, improvement of the road network, and increased niotor vehicle production have caused a considerable increase of traffic volume, the overall amount is less than that of Western Europe. The largest part of road traffic is short -haul trucking operations concentrated around densely populated centers, large industrial or construction sites, and collective farms. Motor transport is the principal mode of transportation only in areas of central Asia and eastern Siberia, in districts without railroads or waterways. Overall, traffic consists mainly of trucks; animal -drawn vehicles continue to be significant outside the major cities and especially in the northern rural areas of the country. The principal types of freight hauled by motor transport consist of manufactured goods, agricultural products, construction materials, and fuel. Automotive repair and fueling facilities are generally inadequate. \"There are shortages of garages, gasoline or diesel -fuel stations, spare parts, and skilled technical personnel. Garages equipped for major repair work are few and mainly in large cities. The government has been engaged in extensive construc- tion of gasoline stations and technical repair stations. Most of these facilities arc located in large cities. Elsewhere, gasoline stations and garages are few and far between. The U.S.S.R. is self- sufficient in motor fuels. Gasoline with octane ratings up to 96, diesel fuel, and lubricants are available in adequate amounts. Road transport operations are greatly hampered by climatic conditions. Most traffic interruptions occur during periods of prolonged rain, especially in spring and autumn, when many secondary roads become muddy and virtually impassable. During dry periods dust conditions prevail on earth, gravel, and crushed stone roads. In winter, freezing temperatures, ice conditions, and snowdrifts obstruct vehicle movement )n most roads. In the northern regions permafrost damages bridges, roads, and culverts. Roads in mountainous areas have numerous sharp curves, steep grades, and narrow 1.nd low- capacity bridges and are subject to snow blockage and spring washouts. As of January 1972, the U.S.S.R motor veiieles inventory was estimated at 7,240,000 units comprising 4,900,000 trucks, 2,050,000 passenger cars and 290,000 buses. Many of the vehicles are of recent manufacture and in fair to good condition. The U.S.S.R. produces its own vehicles but imports a small number of special- purpose vehicles, buses, and motorcycles from Communist Eastern Europe. In 1971, the U.S.S.R produced 613,700 trucks and buses and 529,000 passenger cars. The Soviet Union has been modernizing and greatly expanding its motor vehicle industry. During the past few years, several vehicle assembly plants have been established, and others are being built or planned. The Italian Fiat Motor Company is equipping a passenger -car plant at Tolyatti. The planned output is to be 600,000 units per year when full production is reached, probably in 1974. Moreover, a large heavy truck plant is currently tinder construction at Naberezhnyye Chelny on the Kama River: upon completion it will be the world's largest truck plant with a planned production capacity of 150,000 three -axle, diesel- powered trucks a year. The U.S. S. R.'s road development program is primarily concerned with the reconstruction and improvement of the existing network and secondly with the building of new, long- distance intercity and short- distance feeder roads. Under the current Five Year Plan about 68,000 miles of paved roads are programmed to be constructed. Significant new roads under construction include the following: Tambov to Volgograd, Leningrad to Murmansk, Arkhangel'sk to Vologda, and Kuybyshev to Ufa. Large bridges are under construction at Komsomol'sk- na- Amure, Astrakhan' and Riga. In many large cities bypasses or circumferential roads are under construction in order to expedite through traffic. E.

Undergoing extensive improvements, the inland waterways are playing an increasingly important part in the national transportation pattern and are most instrumental in supporting the Soviot's efforts to increase industrial output ao.d foreign commerce and to expand mining and agric!dtural production. The system is utilized far be;ow capacity and is more than adequate for current traffic requirements. Port facilities, craft, and shipping channels on most major routes are well developed and maintained. There are high operating efficiency standards, and the work force is generally ample in numbers and is well trained and efficient. Major weaknesses in the system include a lack of lengthy east -west interconnected routes necessitating in many instances costly and time- consuming transshipment operations, the closure of many routes from 2 to 9 months each year because of fast ice conditions, and the need of modern and more efficient managerial techniques and procedures. Excluding the Caspian Sea, there are 89,850 route miles of navigable inland waterways in the U.S.S.R., comprising the Inrgest inland waterwav system in the world. The system serves most of the Soviet union's major centers of population, production, and transportation, including the largest maritime ports and major railheads. They are oriented mainly in a north -south directional pattern with few lateral sast- west) interconnections. The European U.S.S.R. waterways provide strategically important internal transport links between the Baltic, White, Black, and Caspian Seas and international connections �some indirectly �with adjacent countries. The unevenly distributed system is dense and fairiv well integrated in the heavily populated and highly productive areas with numerous interconnections made by a high degree of canalization and many dam /lack installations. They provide by far the most important waterwa routes in terms of volume of traffic, types of cargo hauled, and significance of areas served. Except for the Amur system, the waterways in Asiatic U.S.S. R. form lengthy north -south routes, are widely separated and unconnected, and must rely on maritime /river or rail /river transshipment for through east -west, north south cargo movements. In vast area% ni ;ill;i of the \"Trans- Siberian railroad, where increasing industrial development requires north -south freight movement, the Asiatic waterways are the primary means of surface transport. 20 Tl:e most significant inland waterways are grouped in seven large systems as follows: the Greater Volga and Dnepr systems in European U. S.S. R. and the Aral Sea- Am.udar'va, Ob- Irtysh, Yenisey, Lena and Amur systems in Asiatic U.S.S.R. Taternationa! connections are made with inland waterways of Poland, Romania, Finland, Iran, Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the People's Republic of China. Connections to Poland are made via the Pripyat' waterway and the Soviet Polish controlled parts of the Frisches Haff on the Baltic. Soviet access to Central Europe from the Black Sea is available on the Communist controlled international 7anubr, of which its uppermost delta channel forms part of the common boundary between the U.S.S.R. and Romania. Joint Soviet Finnish control is exercised over the Saymenskiv Canal, a route crossing the international border northwest of Leningrad. Other significant connections include: the upper Amudar'ya, forming part of the common boundary between the U.S.S.R. and Afghanistan, the jointly shared Soviet- Iranian Caspian Sea, and the jointly shared sections of the Amur and the Ussuri with the People's Republic of China. Minor approaches to the latter are made via the Argun, Sungacha, Khanka Lake, Ili and the upper Irtysh, and to Mongolia via the Selenge Gol. The Greater Volga and Dnepr systems in European U.S.S.R. are the most highly developed and active waterways in the country, characterized by numerous dam /lock installations, extensive canal links between major rivers and waterways, and long sections of large man -made reservoirs and natural lakes. Accounting for more than half of the total inland waterway freight, the Greater Volga provides heavily trafficked access to, exit from, and transit between the most industrially advanced and urbanized areas west of the Ural Mountains, including such major centers of Soviet waterway activity as Moscow, Rybinsk, Yaroslavl', Kazan', Saratov, Gor'kiy, Kuybyshev, Volgograd, and Perm. The Volga river and eight other connecting waterv�ys, comprising the Greater Volga system, p.-,,vide unified deep -water inland transport network. It currently accommodates the internal passage of 2,000- and 2,700 -ton river /seagoing vessels between the Baltic, White, Black and Caspian S ^as and 5,000- and 6,000 -ton craft between the Baltic, Black and Caspian Seas. During low -water periods, reduced loads are required for all river /seagoing vessels on the lower Don exit to the Black Sea and on u short section of the mid -Volga near Chevoksary for 5,000- and 6000 -ton craft where cargo is temporarily APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 transloaded to an accompanying barge. Small naval c +ift movements, including newly constructed submarines from Gor'kiy and Leningrad, are made to fitting -out facilities on the White Sea. Only upon completion of a dam under construction at Chevoksary, the cascading of the lower Don, and the expansion of the Belomorsk !ock on the White Sea Canal, will the deep water system permit the unimpeded passage of fully loaded river /seagoing vessels of all types between the four seas. The Dnepr system is the most important waterway system west of the Volga. It provides important transportation within the Dnepr basin, particularly from the iron and coal regions to important industrial complexes such as Kherson, Zaporozh've, Dnepropetrovsk, Kiyev, and Gomel'. The system allows access to the Black Sea and makes an international connection with the Polish waterway system in the vicinity of Brest, where through movement is impeded by lockless dams and /or weirs near the border. The major Asiatic systems, comprising mostly natural free flowing rivers with relatively little regulation, are becoming increasingly active and are playing a major role in the exploration and industrial development of the vast regions east of the Ural Mountains including the current exploitation of petroleum and natural gas resources in western Siberia. Except for the self- contained Aral Sea Amudar'ya waterway, the individual Asiatic systems provide rapidly growing industrial, mining, and agricultural centers of the interior access to important maritime /river ports in their northern or eastern Extremities and make vital connections in the south to key rail /river transshipment points along the Trans Siberian railroad. River shipping is closely allied with the movement of cargo in maritime or river /seagoing vessels and is closely coordinated with the east -west movement of freight on the Trans Siberian railroad. From a strategic standpoint, the Amur and its tributaries comprise one of the more important systems, occupying a key position in the industrial, agrarian, military, and political activity of the Soviet Far East. The system serves major port areas with shipbuilding, aircraft- production, steel- production, petroleum refining, and machine tooling capabilities. Komsomol'sk -na -Amore and Khabarovsk, two important ports, rank as two of the most important industrial complexes, and the former has the only naval shipbuilding activity in the Soviet Far East capable of building nuclear- powered submarines. Along with rail, the system plays a vital role in the movement of large amounts of raw materials and semifinished and finished products. most of which are channeled into an expanding industrial base. The Amur accommodates fully loaded 2,000 -ton river /sea- going vessels from the Tatar Strait upstream to Blagoveshchensk, a route that forms a part of extensive river /seagoing routes extending into the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Kuril Islands, and the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The primary traffic interruption factor is fast ice which normally suspends operations on waterways in European U.S.S.R. from 2 to 7 months annually, excluding the ice free southern half of t! e Caspian Sea. In Asiatic U.S.S.R. the waterways are icebound from 5 to 9 months annually, except certain sections of the Aral Sea Amudar'ya system in the extreme south, which are icebound only for a period of 1 to 2 months. Operations are also hampered by short periods of drift ice preceding the freeze and following the spring thaw. On some major waterways icebreakers are used to extend the navigation season during both drift -ice periods. Intensive research and experimentation since 1970 is producing new potential methods for mbating ice formations. Operations on unregulated waterways in both European and Asiatic U.S.S.R. are hindered by seasonal reductions in water level, extreme flooding, excessive shoals and silting, and shifting navigation channels. Generally, the middle and lower sections of the larger rivers are broad and have meandering courses, multiple channels, and shoals. Seasonal variations have been greatly reduced on those rivers regulated by dams. On open lakes and reservoirs, navigation is occasionally suspended because of strong winds and heavy wave action. Soviet inland waterway facilities include locks, dams, weirs, safety gates, levees and groins, pumping stations, bridges, navigational aids, and ports. The heavily cascaded and canalized inland waterway system has at,..ut ;,,NCO regulatory structures for the control of water flow on the 11,600 miles of artificial waterways. The major waterways have slightly more than 30 dams in operation, most of which are large multipurpose dams, eight more in various stages of construction, and several more planned. The significant concentration is in European U.S.S.R. where dams have canalized lengthy sections of the Dnepr and Greater Volga systems, creating stable reservoirs suitable for deep -draft navigation. Many of the dams are earthfill structures. All are bypassed by locks, and several support rail and highway crossings. The major waterways of the system have over 90 major locking installatio +:s (Figure 7), more than 95% of which are located in European U.S.S.R. The well constructed and efficiently operated locks are mostly 21 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 of concrete construction, varying in arrangement from those with single chambers to one installation comprising two parallel rows each with six tandem chambers. The locks vary in size throughout the country but are generally of uniform dimensions on the individual waterways. The gates are of steel, mostly of the miter or lift type. Most locks are also fitted with repair and emergency gates. Lifts range from less than 10 to more than 100 feet, and locking cycles vary from 10 to 15 minutes at single chamber locks to 40 to 50 minutes at multichambered installations. Locking operations are semiautomatic. Most locks are lighted for night operations and provide for one -way lock traffic. Of the major waterways, only the locks on the Volga and Kama rivers of the Greater Volga system allow for two -way traffic with parallel chamber arrangements. The majority of bridges spanning the waterways are of the fixed span type, but a few have movable spans. Most are of steel or reinforced concrete construction. None of the bridges impose any major restrictions on normal vessel operations. Shipping channels on major waterways are marked with an extensive, modern, and well maintained system of floating and shorebased navigational aids 22 for both day and night shipping. Visual navigational aids in use include range lights, beacons, buoys, and lighthouses. The use of radar, ship -to -shore radio and radio telephone and other audio devices is continually expanding. Ports serving the waterway system include inland ports and those with a joint maritime /river function. Excluding the maritime /river ports, the system is serviced by 54 major inland ports -36 in European U.S.S.R. and 18 in Asiatic U.S.S.R. Each major port usually consists of a complex of two or more extensively developed facilities, most having at least 1,000 feet of berthing, and each transfers over a million tons annually. All are focal points of industry and transportation, and some are major transshipment centers for maritime, rail, highway, and inland waterway cargo. The majority are adequately equipped with quayage, open and covered storage facilities, mechanical handling equipment, and rail and /or highway clearance facilities. Significant features of most ports include a high degree of mechanization and standardization in cargo handling facilities, the extensive use of floating cranes and specialized bulk transloading devices, the division of berthing facilities into sections for handling specific APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090035 -8 FIGURE 7.

Occasional bottlenecks occur at some ports during peak traffic periods due to a shortage of freight cars, inefficient allocat5n of manpower and equipment, poor planning and supervision in operating techniques and procedures, and insufficient quantities of high- speed cargo handling equipment. Year -round port activity is increasing primarily due to prolonged port operations during the winter period by more intensive use of icebreakers, the establishment of higher labor productivity standards, the expansior of containerized cargo operations, the provision for 'getter coordinated river /rail operations, and the utilization of river craft for winter storage purposes as well as loading craft for the coming navigation season. Ongoing port development includes construction of new ports, enlargement of existing facilities, the installations of heavy -duty cargo- handling equipment, nd the introduction cif containerized cargo operations. ;Major new port construction is underway at Balakovo, Novochebolsarsk, Tol'yatti on the Volga, Med- v �zhyegorsk on Lake Onega, Kambarka on the Kama, Tomsk on the Tom, Surgut on the Ob', Tobol'sk on the Irtysh, and Osetrovo on the Lena. Leading centers of combined maritime /river operations are Kherson, Leningrad, Arkhangel'sk, Kaliningrad, Reni, and Izmail in European U.S.S.R.; and Dudinka, Igarka, and NikIllayevsk -na -Amure in Asiatic U.S.S.R. In terms of location, complexity of the transport function, cargo turnover, and extent of facilities, key inland ports in European U.S.S.R. are Zaporozh'ye, Dnepropetrovsk and Kiyev on the Dnepr; Astrakhan', Valgograd, Saratov, Kuybyshev, Tol'yatti, Ulya- novsk, Kazan', Gor'kiy, Kineshma, Yaroslavl' and Rybinsk on the Volga; Cherepovets on the Rybinsk reservoir of the Volga Baltic Waterway; Baku, Krasnovodsk, and Makhachkala on the Caspian Sea; Rostov, Ust'- Donetskiy, and Volgodonsk on the Don, Perin' on the Kama; and the Moscow complex served by the ports of Yuzhnyy, Zapadnvy, and Severnyy. In Asiatic U.S.S.R., key inland ports are Omsk and Tobol'sk on the Irtysh; Surgut, Kolpashevo, and Novosibirsk on the Ob'; Krasnoyarsk (Figure 8) on the Yenisey; Ust'- Kut /Osetrovo and Yakutsk on the Lena; and Komsomolsk -na- Amure, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk on the Amur. In 1972, Soviet waterway shipping carried 435.4 million short tons of cargo and generated a ton -mile performance of 123.3 billion. The average length of haul was about 300 miles. Passengers carried and passenger -miles in 1971 were 14E.5 million and 3.5 billion, respectively. The average journey was 25 miles. Sand, gravel, and other construction materials constitute about 50� %0 of the total freight traffic, rafted and shipped timber and lumber about 25 and crude oil and petroleum products about 9 Coal and ores, grain and other foodstuffs, and general cargo comprise the remaining 16 The traffic patterns of the several systems vary to some degree but are mainly long -haul north -south freight movements. With the exception of rafted timber, dependence on inland shipping is inversely related to the accessibility of other carriers, and the shippers choice of transport services is dictated by urgency rather than economic advantages. In some parts of Asiatic U.S.S.R., however, inland waterway transport is the only medium of bulk haulage available, although, in many cases, other modes are relied upon for through east -west movement. Despite the significant role of the Asiatic waterways, the waterways in European U.S.S.R. handle at least 90% of all waterway traff"
