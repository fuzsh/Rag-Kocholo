        "text": "I haven't really found a definitive answer to this one. I'm planning on replacing my factory fogs with a set from baja. I'm unsure about whether to go with a regular white light or amber lens though.\n\nI know that amber cuts through the fog better but how well does it perform as far as regular lighting goes? I generally use the fog lights for their intended purpose but I do occasionally like to use them to widen my beams a bit more to light up the ditches during deer mating season.\n\nWill I lose any usable light spread if I change over to an amber lens? Thanks guys\n\nThe amber should have the same light pattern but just be slightly lower intensity because of the filtered light.\n\nNone of the BD fogs (wide angle beam) are street legal. They aren't DOT approved and they don't have sufficient cutoff to be used on road. In other words even if you point them way down they still throw too much light at oncoming traffic. So if you are going to swap out your factory fogs with BDs be aware you aren't allowed to use them on-road anymore.\n\nThe amber most likely isn't going to appear as bright visually to you as a whiter light would appear, but a good aftermarket amber will still perform as well as, if not better, than a stock fog. Some people think amber is much better, and some can't stand it! If you can find a local store that sells lights and has a display set up, then go in and see for yourself to see what you like best before purchasing....Or find some TWers to hang out with to compare haha.\n\nThat said, @DVexile is correct and you shouldn't run pods that aren't street legal while driving on the road. One because it's illegal, and two out of courtesy for other drivers (this increasing yours and their safety). If you don't ever run them on a road, then it'll be no problem!\n\nI have amber duallie floods in my pelfreybilt front bumper. I bought them for fog. To be honest, If I did it again, I would probably go with white. the ambers look super dope, and I get a lot of comments on them, but in the end, I think white is just a more useable light. If I did go with amber again, I would get the spots rather than the floods. The amber duallies are very bright, but they just don't seem bright due to the light being amber if that makes sense.\n\nas for fog, there are a few very detailed threads about this, but the gist is that amber light doesn't necessarily \"cut through\" fog better, it just doesn't glare off of the water droplets in the air back into your eyes as bad, because our eyes don't see glare in yellows, reds and oranges as bad as straight up white or blue (think red light for night vision. same concept). This is also why you always want your fogs to be as low as possible, to prevent as much light reflecting directly back at your face.\n\nThe nice thing about our lights is the ability to change beam patterns or colors as desired. This allows you to determine if Amber or White is best for your application.\n\nhttps://www.bajadesigns.com/science-of-lighting/uservice.asp\n\nhttps://www.bajadesigns.com/products/Replacement-Lenses.asp\n\nThe Amber will be better for poor weather conditions like fog, rain, dust, snow, etc. In other conditions you will have minimal difference in output in Amber vs. White.\n\nThe White will appear brighter to the human eye due to the color temperature (5000K)\n\nLike mentioned above our lights are NOT street legal or DOT approved. We do have many customers using the Squadron-R Sport series with no issues but it is up to driver discretion.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThank You,\n\nBailey, Baja Designs\n\nSo is there a direct amber replacement bulb for the factory fogs?\n\nThanks! I was just about to buy a set of 4000 lumen LEDs yesterday. After reading his other thread about putting LED's into halogen housing units I changed my mind.\n\nIf ordering that wiring harness doesn't pan out I'm probably just going to go with baja lights anyway. I'm in a pretty rural area and lots of people around here run cheapo light bars without hassle. Would just treat them as high beams around traffic\n\nThis.\n\nIf you actually drive in fog or smog, amber is your friend.\n\nIf you do @crashnburn80 ultimate headlight upgrade, and you overdrive your headlights on a clear night, well, you're well over any legal speeds anyway.\n\nIf you need more light than that gives for offroad or really rural use, then making the move to auxiliary independently switched lighting is the solution."
