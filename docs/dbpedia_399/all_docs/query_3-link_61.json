The areas with wet summers and cold winters were predicted highly suitable for H. anatolica. The model predicted that the species will expand its distribution range in the future under both climate change scenarios.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe impacts of climate change on biodiversity are largely being observed around the world, which are expected to increase unless substantial actions are implemented to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC 2022). Modeling and field studies have demonstrated species' extinctions under moderate warming; however, these are not uniformly distributed across different areas and taxonomic groups (Urban 2015, Román-Palacios & Wiens 2020). Species respond to climate change through alterations in their spatial distribution, and range expansions or contractions (Denryter & Fischer 2022, Stewart et al. 2022). Endemic species are highly important for sustaining ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity. However, these species are vulnerable to habitat degradation, climate change, and disturbance etc. (Chichorro et al. 2019, Staude et al. 2020). The regions with high endemism rate are highly vulnerable to climate change at species and community levels (Dirnböck et al. 2011, Enquist et al. 2019). Therefore, preservation of endemic species is important for the maintenance of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.\n\nSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to direct conservation programs, estimate the effects of climate change on the distribution of native and nonnative species, predict their potential dispersal, and produce applied ecological research (Sutton & Martin 2022). Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt) is a machine learning algorithm and one of the most frequently used models to infer the impacts of climate change on species' distribution. The MaxEnt model is known to have better performance than other modelling algorithms (Phillips et al. 2006, 2017). The MaxEnt model can be used to predict the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of endemic species (Urbani et al. 2017, Elith et al. 2011, Abdelaal et al. 2019).\n\nHydrothassa anatolica Şahin & Özdikmen, 2019 (Chrysomelidae: Chrysomelinae) is an endemic herbivore species, which was first reported by Şahin and Özdikmen (2019) during 2019 from Kayseri Province, Türkiye (38°28′50″ N 36°27′29″E). The second record of the species was reported by Sırrı (2022) during 2021 from Yüksekova district in Hakkari province of the country (37°32′95″ N 44°19′41″E). The distribution of endemic species is readily affected by climate changes; however, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of H. anatolica have never been studied in the country.\n\nTherefore, this study determined the habitat suitability of H. anatolica in Türkiye under different climate change scenarios. It was hypothesized that climate change will exert significant negative impacts on the distribution of H. anatolica. The results would help to identify the suitable areas for conservation of the species if climate change poses an extinction risk.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy area\n\nThe Yüksekova district is located in the Hakkari province of Türkiye (37.5717°N latitude and 44.2823°S longitude). The total area of the district is 2,385 km2 with an average altitude of 1,950 m.\n\nHabitat suitability modeling\n\nHabitat suitability of H. anatolica was predicted by MaxEnt model. The MaxEnt uses occurrence records to assess the likelihood of a species' existence and the maximum entropy distribution to generate the random background points (Abdelaal et al. 2019, Duflot et al. 2018). The MaxEnt model is reliable and effective for predicting species distribution by using limited species data and multiple environmental variables. Furthermore, it can successfully predict the distribution of the target species with presence only data (Vanderwal et al. 2009, Warren & Seifert 2011). The model has been proved effective in successfully predicting the distribution of species with limited occurrence data (Tang et al. 2021). Similarly, MaxEnt model has been reported to have high predictive power in forecasting the potential distribution of diverse species compared to other species distribution models (Ren-Yan et al. 2014, Li et al. 2020). Therefore, habitat suitability of H. anatolica was predicted under current and future climatic conditions of Türkiye using MaxEnt model. Habitat suitability was predicted for 2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080 and 2081–2100 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), i.e., SSP1-2.6 (low greenhouse gas emissions scenario) and SSP5-8.5 (high greenhouse gas emissions scenario). SSP1-2.6 assumes that CO2 emissions would be cut to net zero around 2075. However, SSP5-8.5 assumes that CO2 emissions would be tripled by 2075. The likely temperature increase during 2081–2100 is 1.3 – 2.4 °C and 3.3 – 5.7 °C under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2021).\n\nSpecies occurrence data\n\nExploratory surveys were conducted during 2022 and 2023 to determine the occurrence of H. anatolica. The surveys were conducted from May to July at 58 locations. The occurrence of H. anatolica was reviewed at each location and geographic coordinates were retrieved for georeferencing (Ozaslan et al. 2016). Different habitats such as meadow-pasture areas, roadsides, and agricultural areas were surveyed to record the occurrence of H. anatolica. The survey locations are given in Fig. 1. Furthermore, a detailed literature search was conducted to find the occurrence records of the species around the world. The literature search did not retrieve any occurrence records; hence, the model was calibrated and tested with the occurrences recorded during the survey.\n\nClimate data\n\nThe data relating to bioclimatic variables (Hijmans et al. 2005) at a fine resolution (30 arc sec, ∼1 km2) was downloaded from worldclim (https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) (Fick & Hijmans 2017). The historical (1970–2000) and future (2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080 and 2081–2100) data of bioclimatic variables (Table 1) were downloaded and used in the modeling exercise.\n\nTable 1.\n\nCodeDescriptionUnitCodeDescriptionUnitbio1Annual Mean Temperature°Cbio11Mean Temperature of the Coldest Quarter(°C)bio2Mean Diurnal Range (mean of monthly [max temp − min temp])°Cbio12Annual Precipitationmmbio3Isothermal Temperature (bio2/bio7) ×100indexbio13Precipitation of the Wettest monthmmbio4Temperature Seasonalityindexbio14Precipitation of the Driest Monthmmbio5Maximum Temperature of the Hottest Month°Cbio15Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)indexbio6Minimum Temperature of the Coldest Month°Cbio16Precipitation of Wettest Quartermmbio7Temperature Annual Range (bio5–bio6)°Cbio17Precipitation of Driest Quartermmbio8Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter°Cbio18Precipitation of the Hottest Quartermmbio9Mean Temperature of the Driest Quarter°Cbio19Precipitation of the Coldest Quartermmbio10Mean Temperature of the Hottest Quarter°C\n\nModel calibration\n\nThe bioclimatic variables were selected for predicting the habitat suitability of H. anatolica prior to model calibration. The MaxEnt model was calibrated with the 19 bioclimatic variables (Table 1) and occurrence records of the species. The bioclimatic variables with the highest contribution towards the model were selected. Furthermore, the values of the bioclimatic variables were extracted to the occurrence records using the extract function in ‘raster’ package (Van Lenteren et al. 2018). Pearson correlation was tested among the extracted values of bioclimatic variables and those with correlation coefficient of >0.7 were eliminated. Hence, the model was calibrated with nine bioclimatic variables, i.e., bio1 (annual mean temperature), bio5 (maximum temperature of warmest month), bio6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month), bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter), bio9 (average temperature of the driest quarter), bio11 (average temperature of the coldest quarter), bio14 (precipitation of driest month), bio18 (precipitation of warmest quarter), and bio19 (precipitation of the coldest quarter).\n\nThe model was calibrated on global scale in a hierarchical fashion (Petitpierre et al. 2012). The default settings of MaxEnt were used to calibrate and test the model due to the lower number of occurrence records. A 10,000 background records, 5,000 iterations, and 10 replications were used for determining the habitat suitability under current and future climatic conditions. The model was calibrated on 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%. 2.6. Model Validation and Predictive power.\n\nThe predictive power of the MaxEnt model was determined by ROC or AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) curves. The predicted areas as suitable were visually validated by inspecting the occurrence record of the species. The contribution of the bioclimatic variables was determined by Jackknife analysis. The rasters produced by MaxEnt model were imported to ArcGIS (Pearson et al. 2003) and classified to determine the habitat suitability under current and future climatic conditions. Habitat suitability index ranging from 0 to 1 was divided into four categories, i.e., 0–0.25 (unsuitable), 0.26–0.50 (slightly suitable), 0.51–0.75 (suitable) and 0.76–1.0 (highly suitable). The rasters were downscaled to Türkiye, classified according to these categories and the area corresponding to each category was calculated by raster calculation tool in ArcGIS. The increase/decrease in the habitat suitability was then computed under future climatic conditions compared to the current climate of the country.\n\nResults\n\nThe H. anatolica was recorded from 11 different locations during the surveys (Table 2).\n\nTable 2.\n\nLocationCoordinatesBiological stageNumberFirst recordKayseri/Türkiye36°27′29.00″E/ 38°28′50.00″ Nadult2022Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°15′56.91″E/ 37°29′36.51″Nlarva29Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°18′53.33″E/ 37°33′19.26″Nlarva5Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°19′24.56″E/ 37°32′38.85″Nlarva92023Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°21′41.66″E/ 37°28′52.53″Nlarva14Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°19′12.15″E/ 37°27′39.55″Nlarva12Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°18′36.68″E/ 37°33′36.02″Nlarva5Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°19′14.34″E/ 37°32′58.56″Nlarva8Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°13′51.89″E/ 37°32′29.82″Nlarva3Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°10′43.32″E/ 37°33′51.39″Nlarva3Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°11′28.99″E/ 37°34′38.54″Nlarva19Yüksekova/Hakkari/Türkiye44°11′47.24″E/ 37°34′34.99″Nlarva89\n\nModel validation and predictive power\n\nThe AUC is a statistical value used to assess the predictive power of the model. The predictive power of the model increases as the AUC value approaches 1 and decreases as the value moves away from 1. Generally, a value > 0.5 indicates that the model has a good predictive power (Bradley et al. 2013). The AUC values of test and training gain of the model ranged between 0.98 and 0.99 under current and future climatic conditions, indicating that the model predicted the habitat suitability of H. anatolica with a high accuracy (Fig. 2). Furthermore, visual validation of the predicted habitat suitability revealed that all occurrence records were within the area predicted as highly suitable for the species. Hence, both methods revealed high predictive power of MaxEnt model for estimating the habitat suitability of H. anatolica under current and future climatic conditions.\n\nContribution of bioclimatic variables to the model\n\nThe bioclimate variables with the highest contribution towards the model were bio 8 (mean temperature of the wettest quarter), bio 6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month), and bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter). Similarly, the variables with the highest permutation importance were bio6 and bio18 (precipitation of warmest quarter) under current and future climatic conditions. The model indicated that minimum temperature of the coldest month and precipitation of warmest quarter will be the most important bioclimatic parameters determining the habitat suitability of H. anatolica under current and future climatic conditions (Fig. 3).\n\nClimatic suitability of Hydrothassa anatolica under current and future climatic conditions\n\nAlthough the first record of H. anatolica was reported from Türkiye and literature search did not find any occurrence record in the rest of the world, MaxEnt model indicated that there are some regions in the world having suitable habitat for H. anatolica. Therefore, detailed survey studies are needed in these regions to confirm the presence of H. anatolica. Habitat suitability of H. anatolica in Türkiye under future climatic conditions is shown in Figs 4 –7. The model predicted that Eastern Anatolia (Hakkari, Bitlis, Muş, Bingöl, Elazığ and Tunceli), Mediterranean (Kahramanmaraş, Mersin), Central Anatolia (Konya, Kayseri and Kahraman) and Southeastern Anatolia regions have the highest habitat suitability for H. anatolica. Furthermore, habitat suitability gradually decreased in the Aegean and Marmara regions. Out of the total surface area of Türkiye, 8.63, 20.30, 19.29 and 51.76% were highly suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable, respectively for H. anatolica under current climatic conditions of the country (Fig. 8A). Highly suitable areas consistently increased under future climatic conditions (Fig. 8B).\n\nThe results revealed that highly suitable regions would undergo spatial changes under future climatic conditions of Türkiye. The highly suitable areas will be shifted towards the western, southern, and northern sides of the country under low greenhouse gas emissions scenario, i.e., SPS1-2.6. Overall, highly suitable areas will witness an increase till 2021–2040 compared to current climatic conditions. Although the model predicted a similar pattern of increase in the highly suitable areas for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080, the increase was lesser than 2021–2040 indicating a slight decline would occur in the highly suitable areas. However, the areas predicted as highly suitable for 2041–2060 and 2061–2080 were higher than the highly suitable area under current climatic conditions of the country (Figs 7 and 8). The model predicted the highest percentage of highly suitable area for 2081–2100 under SPS1-2.6 climate change scenario.\n\nThe model estimated a similar suitable area for 2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080 and 2081–2100 under SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario as of SPS1-2.6. Although the predicted areas under both climate change scenarios were similar, spatial variation existed for the suitable areas (Figs 7 and 8). It was predicted that the suitable areas for the species will increase under SSP5-8.5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nClimate change is one of the most important ecological problems in the world (Onen & Ozcan 2010). This may affect the biology and behavior of many living organisms, including insects, as well as changes in their habitats. Global warming-mediated temperature increase will cause insects to have much shorter developmental periods than normal and increase their reproductive abilities. This situation will affect the habitat suitability of a number of insects and cause an increase in their migratory behavior (Yaşar et al. 2021). Current estimates regarding climate change indicate a global average annual temperature increase of 1 °C by the year 2025 and a 3 °C rise by the end of the century. These temperature elevations have a range of effects on insects (Porter et al. 1991). Climate changes can affect distribution, overwintering periods, population growth, population density, development period, and host-pest synchronization (Skendžić et al. 2021). Temperature and precipitation can be significant factors in the selection of suitable habitats for insects (Lee et al. 2021, Soliman et al. 2023, Wei et al. 2023).\n\nThe MaxEent model predicted that habitat suitability of H. anatolica will increase in Türkiye under different climate change scenarios. The suitable areas for H. anatolica will consistently increase under both climate change scenarios included in the study. It was predicted that H. anatolica would undergo spatial shifts under high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Therefore, H. anatolica could gradually expand its distribution range to other regions (Central Anatolia, Mediterranean, Marmara, Aegean, and Black Sea) of the country besides Eastern Anatolia in the future. The unsuitable areas under current climate and suitable areas in the future might benefited from the increase of ecological (temperature and precipitation) parameters necessary for suitable habitats of H. anatolica. Species' survival and their distribution patterns are directly impacted by climate change and other human activities (Pearson & Dawson 2003). Therefore, understanding the possible impacts of climate change on species distribution is of great significance. Various earlier studies have predicted an increase in the habitats of several species under changing climate (Pena et al. 2014, Hernández-Baz et al. 2016). Our findings are in line with the earlier studies indicating that the studied species will benefit from climate change.\n\nThe MaxEnt model predicted the habitat suitability of H. anatolica with high accuracy (99%) under current and future climatic conditions. The high accuracy could be explained with the restricted distribution of the species due to endemic nature. Earlier studies have indicated that SDMs predict the habitat suitability of endemic species with high accuracy compared to non-endemic species (Mcpherson & Jetz 2007, Pena et al. 2014, Hernández-Baz et al. 2016). Despite limited occurrence records being used to train and test the model, MaxEnt model works well with low occurrence data which is evident from its high predictive power in the current study. Although H. anatolica has been recorded from only two provinces in Türkiye, the highly suitable regions predicted by the model have not been surveyed to record the presence of the species in the country. Therefore, these regions should be explored to record the presence of the species. Furthermore, some of the countries sharing border with Türkiye have also been predicted to contain a significant portion highly suitable for the species; therefore, surveying in these regions is also necessary.\n\nContrary to our hypothesis that climate change could result in the habitat contraction of the species, MaxEnt model indicated that H. anatolica would increase its range under low and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios used in the current study. The predicted increase in habitat suitability could be linked with the presence of vacant niches in the country which are expected to be filled with the changing climate. Several earlier studies have indicated habitat expansion of endemic species under changing climate (Urbani et al. 2017, Beca-Carretero et al. 2020, Khajoei Nasab et al. 2022).\n\nThe study predicted that minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio6), mean temperature of driest quarter (bio9) and the precipitation amount of the warmest quarter (bio 8) wouşd affect the distribution of H. anatolica under changing climatic conditions. This could be explained by the current distribution range of the species. The undisturbed natural structure of the study area, climatic characteristics, limited use of chemical pesticides, and environmental factors that can have a favorable impact on biodiversity are thought to be the main reasons for the distribution of the species in the study area. Outhwaite et al. (2022) have indicated that insect densities are higher in natural undisturbed areas, and biodiversity loss in these ecosystems is lower compared to habitats with intensive agricultural practices.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe MaxEnt model predicted that climate change will have a positive impact on the habitat suitability of H. anatolica. The species will expand its distribution range under low and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Contrary to our hypothesis, climate change would exert positive impact on the distribution of H. anatolica in the country. Furthermore, model predicted that there is no extinction risk to the species under changing climate.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.S. and S.F.; methodology, S.F.; software, M.S.; validation, C.Ö., M.S. and N.B.; formal analysis, M.S.; investigation, M.S.; resources, M.S.; data curation, M.S.; writing original draft preparation, M.S.; writing review and editing, S.F., C.Ö., N.B.; visualization, M.S.; supervision, C.Ö.; project administration, M.S.; funding acquisition, M.S.
