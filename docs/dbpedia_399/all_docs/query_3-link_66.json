Thus, some time\n\nago, representatives of the Hizb ut-Tahrir organisation fraudulently took possession of the seal and\n\nconstituent documents of the local Muslim community of Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of\n\nCrimea, “Sarabuz”, made illegal personnel reshuffles having registered with the statistics authorities\n\nand the Unified State Register of Legal Entities a certain representative of the Hizb ut-Tahrir party,\n\nEnver Kadyrov, as a chairman. The Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of Crimea appealed to law\n\nenforcement agencies to punish the persons guilty of stealing the documents and the seal of the\n\n“Sarabuz” community. Currently, a question of initiating a criminal case is raised.\n\nWe consider it necessary to inform you thereof.\n\nWe recommend that you examine with special attention and vigilance the activities of the extremist\n\nparty Hizb ut-Tahrir, the current formal head of the “Sarabuz” community, as well as any Muslim\n\norganisations trying to independently, without the written approval of the Spiritual Directorate of\n\nMuslims of Crimea, issue land documentation for the territory of your village council.\n\nBased on the above,\n\nWE KINDLY ASK YOU TO:\n\n1.

The text of such books itself contains many grammatical\n\nerrors and blatantly untrue information and conclusions that the authors of these books try to present as the\n\nprovisions and norms of Islam, allegedly taken from the hadiths and verses of the Koran.\n\nAnnex 824\n\n2\n\nSo, here is a brochure titled “The Hizb-t-Tahrir programme”…\n\n[…]\n\nPage 8\n\nStatements like the above have already become the object of public attention, however, each time, Hizb-ut-\n\nTahrir, through the lips of its adherents, denied calls for the overthrow of the state system and “rulers” of\n\nUkraine. The motivation was that Ukraine is a Dar al-Kufr state, where the laws of Islam are not\n\nimplemented, that’s why, they say, in Ukraine, actions to overthrow the state system are not envisaged.\n\nBut, if you attentively read the content of the penultimate paragraph of page 15 of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir\n\nprogramme, you can see the following: - “But if the territory is Dar al-Kufr, where the laws of Islam are not\n\nimplemented, then the removal of the ruler from power, who governs Muslims, is carried out through nusrat\n\n(asking for help) ...”.\n\nThe very same nusrat (asking for help) is described in the second paragraph of the same page 15:\n\n- “In the case when there is no opportunity to fight against the ruler, where armed confrontation is not an\n\nobligation, it becomes necessary to prepare the forces and ask for help from those in power. As soon as the\n\nopportunity arises, it becomes imperative to reject the ruler and fight against him”.\n\nThat is, Ukraine, at a minimum, should prepare for the “removal of the ruler” by “asking for help from those\n\nin power” and, if the opportunity arises, overthrowing the ruler and fighting against him.\n\nAs you can see, at this stage of its activities in Ukraine, the Hizb ut-Tahrir party is still only promoting the\n\nabove ideas, however, there is no doubt that this propaganda will sooner or later end with direct actions.\n\nTherefore, the Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of Crimea appeals to those Muslims who sympathise with, or\n\nare in the ranks of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir party:\n\n- Think it over!\n\nOf course, today the Ukrainian state has created quite comfortable conditions for the spread of ideologies\n\nlike Hizb ut-Tahrir, but after all, everything can change in one moment. The appeals of the ideologists of\n\nHizb-ut-Tahrir, whose names are hidden from you, even now, fall directly under criminal offenses.\n\nAre you really ready to sacrifice your life and freedom for the sake of the will of the leaders of Hizb, hiding\n\nin foggy Albion?\n\nIslam does not spread through coercion, war and murder. Faith in Allah does not need bloodshed!\n\nDar al-Islam - Islamic land;\n\nkafir - unfaithful;\n\nkufr - unbelief;\n\nmunkar - everything that is forbidden by the verses of the Koran, hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad;\n\nDar al-Kufr - the land of the infidels.\n\nAnalytical department of Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of Crimea.\n\n[Contain extracts from materials recognised as extremist in the Russian Federation]\n\nAnnex 824\n\nAnnex 825\n\nLetter of E.

Totsky\n\nIn response to your letter dated 27 April 2012 No. 76/5/5654-2 with a request to analyse the\n\nprinted materials of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir party at the disposal of the Spiritual Directorate of Muslims\n\nof Crimea (hereinafter referred to as SDMC), we would like to inform you as follows.\n\nWithin the framework of the programme announced by the SDMC to counter the influence of\n\nreligious sects on Muslims and residents of Crimea, as well as inspecting the mosques of the\n\nCrimean peninsula, our Directorate collected printed materials of the so-called Hizb-ut-Tahrir party.\n\nNo matter how this structure calls itself: “party”, “group”, “religious organisation”, etc., this\n\nstructure, in our opinion, fully falls under the definition of a destructive cult, the term used by\n\nsociologists, psychologists, forensic scientists, publicists, theologians in relation to religious, neoreligious\n\nand other groups and organisations that cause harm to society or their members (material,\n\npsychological or physical), as well as those suspected of potential danger of such harm.\n\nThe following signs point to the pronounced sectarian orientation of Hizb-ut-Tahrir:\n\n- closed structure of this organisation,\n\n- proclaiming their ideology as “the ultimate truth”,\n\n- using the method of isolating group members from other Muslims by dividing people into\n\n“us and them”, that is, believers and non-believers,\n\n- “sticking labels”, refusal of state legalisation of their activities, etc.\n\nAn important goal of Hizb-ut-Tahrir is to loosen and destroy the structure of non-Muslim\n\npublic administration, and, ultimately, the destruction of physical borders and constitutional\n\nfoundations of the states in which Hizb-ut-Tahrir operates.\n\nIt should be noted that within the framework of the “Islakh” programme, not all the literature\n\nof Hizb-ut-Tahrir has been analysed. But based on the available printed material, it can be noted\n\nthat\n\n- a limited number of canonical texts is used, only to substantiate their own ideology.\n\n- political context prevails over religious\n\n- there is intolerance, xenophobia and, moreover, a call for an irreconcilable struggle against\n\ndisbelief and dissent, and against a regime and a system that are not clerical.\n\n- the ideas like “there are us and strangers”, “we must fight strangers” are persistently\n\nimplemented using religious vocabulary, and, consequently, appealing to the sacred in the\n\nAnnex 825\n\n2\n\nsubconscious of the reader.\n\n- there is an open call for violent methods of changing the state system, non-recognition and\n\ndisobedience to the current legislation, as “the laws of disbelief.”\n\n- Islamic concepts and terms are perversely interpreted, for example, jihad is presented as\n\nwar, aggression, which is an extremely subjective opinion.\n\nIn return, SDMC in this conclusion quotes from the brochures of this organisation, indicating\n\nthe page number and title of the brochure, as well as gives its own brief explanations.\n\nThe analysed brochures are provided to you in the attachment to this analysis.\n\n- “This hadith says that the rule of non-Islamic laws obliges Muslims to fight against the\n\nrulers, and this proves that the conversion of Islam is one of the conditions for the existence of Dar\n\nal-Islam. If the rule is carried out by non-Islamic laws, the battle is mandatory.”\n\n“That is, the kafirs should not have power over Muslims, since the transfer of power to them\n\n(kafirs) makes the Muslim possession the possession of kufr, and not the possession of Islam. Rasul\n\n(as) ordered to carry out campaigns against every country that did not submit to the authority of\n\nMuslims, and he fought with them, regardless of whether the inhabitants of this country were\n\nMuslims or non-Muslims ...” (p. 3 “Programme of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\n- “The meaning of these two hadiths is that we must fight against the rulers with arms if they\n\nfail to establish Islamic rule and observe its order. To fight against them if they establish the laws of\n\nkufr and fight against them if they show clear kufr. To fight them means to fight against them, to\n\nremove them from ruling and to return the rule to the laws of Islam. Therefore, it becomes clear\n\nthat the main problem of a Muslim is the rule of Islam and the elimination of the rule of the laws\n\nof kufr”... (p. 7 “Programme of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\n- “Moreover, engaging in this activity and the like, they deviate from the fulfillment of the\n\nmandatory requirements, which are the destruction of the laws of kufr and the return of the\n\nimplementation of Islamic laws in life, state, society”. (p. 11 “Programme of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\n- “Sharia prohibits to use force against the ruler and fight against him if he commits\n\nmunkar, except in the case of an obvious manifestation of kufr, that is, if the ruler begins to rule the\n\nlaws of kufr and is silent and inactive in the event of strengthening of kufr (disbelief) in the country.\n\nIn this case, it is necessary to organise an armed confrontation against the ruler in order to deprive\n\nhim of the authority to govern, in order to stop him from applying the laws of kufr. If he does not\n\nstop applying the laws of kufr, an armed uprising against him will be aimed at completely removing\n\nhim from power (from his position), returning to the governance by the laws of Sharia and their\n\nimplementation...\n\nThese hadiths indicate the need to take arms against the ruler in the event that he manifests\n\nexplicit kufr, for which there is an evidence from Allah, that is, if he rules the laws of kufr.\n\nIf there is an opportunity to eliminate the ruler and the probability of elimination prevails,\n\nMuslims are obliged to raise arms against him and fight with the aim of removing him from power,\n\nbecause the obligation to use physical force to eliminate the munkar and organize an armed\n\nconfrontation against the ruler who has shown obvious kufr, is characterized by the possibility of a\n\nMuslim for the implementation of these actions, as indicated in many hadiths: “... and if he is not\n\nable, then let him change the language.”\n\nIn the case when there is no opportunity to fight against the ruler, where armed confrontation\n\nis not an obligation, it becomes necessary to accumulate forces and ask for help from those in\n\npower. As soon as the opportunity arises, it becomes imperative to reject the ruler and fight against\n\nhim.\n\n... But if the territory is Dar al-Kufr, where the laws of Islam are not enforced, then the\n\nelimination of the ruler from power who rules the Muslims is carried out by means of nusrat (asking\n\nfor help) ...“, (pp. 14, 15 “Program of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\nAnnex 825\n\n3\n\n- “In these political affairs which Hizb-ut-Tahrir deals with, the following is clearly visible:\n\nactivities consisting in a political struggle against the states of kufr, which have influence and\n\nexert influence on Islamic countries, and this struggle is carried out in order to rid the Islamic\n\nummah of their domination and free it from their influence, in order to eradicate the ideological,\n\neducational (sakofat), political and military roots, and also finally destroy their laws in other\n\nMuslim countries”... (pp. 18, 19 “Programme of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\n- “A political fighting characterised by the following:\n\na) the fight against the kafir colonial states, which have power and influence over the Islamic\n\ncountries, the fight against the coloniser against all his ideological, political, economic and military\n\ngoals, the disclosure of his plans, the exposure of his conspiracies in order to free the ummah from\n\ntheir power and from any their influence”. (p. 26 “Programme of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\n- “Hizb-ut-Tahrir did this, imitating the Messenger of Allah, indeed he came with the\n\nmessage of Islam to the whole world, challenging openly and believing in the truth that defies kufr\n\n(unbelief) throughout the world and declaring war on all people, without paying any attention to\n\ncustoms, traditions, religions, ideologies of rulers and ordinary people”. (p. 27 “Programme of\n\nHizb-ut-Tahrir”)\n\nIt is evident from the above texts that Hizb-ut-Tahrir openly calls for Jihad against infidel\n\nstates.\n\nIt should be clarified that the concept of Jihad does not mean only the conduct of hostilities.\n\nJihad - Jihad (from Arab. [ ل)الجھك ʒi’ha:d] — “effort”) - a concept in Islam, meaning diligence\n\nin the way of Allah. The concept of Jihad is much wider than its philistine understanding only in the\n\nform of waging war. Jihad in Islam is also the fight against one's spiritual or social vices (for\n\nexample, against lies, deceit, depravity of society, etc.), the elimination of social injustice, constant\n\nzeal in the spread of Islam. Moreover, in Arabic, the word “jihad” means any effort or diligence, in\n\nparticular in work, study, etc.\n\nHowever, Hizb-ut-Tahrir calls on Muslims precisely to military action.\n\n- “It is on them (Muslims - ed.) to explain that the action of the Islamic State, after its\n\nestablishment, will be based on the Sharia, regardless of whether it is inside the state, like the\n\nmanagement of affairs and enforcement of decrees, or outside the state, like the implementation of\n\nIslam by jihad against all people; and the destruction of physical barriers that prevent the\n\nfulfillment of Islam.\n\n... And this wisdom is presented in the implementation of the laws of Islam, without a\n\ndifference between prayer and jihad, between prayer (dua) and intimidation of the enemy, between\n\nzakat and cutting off the hand of a thief, between saving those in trouble and killing those attacking\n\nthe holiness of Muslims. And all this is Sharia law, which are all executed by a Muslim or a state in\n\ntheir reality and in their time” (p. 9 “Dangerous Concepts”),\n\nThe pamphlet with the same name of the party – “Hizb ut-Tahrir” calls for the implementation\n\nof the Jihad, in a military sense, and its supposed obligation for Muslims, even in the case of peace:\n\n- “Jihad is a self-sacrificing war on the path of Allah to exalt the word of monotheism and\n\nspread Islam throughout the world. This war can be expressed both in direct participation in the\n\njihad and in its material and ideological support. Therefore, the war for the exaltation of the word\n\nof Allah and the spread of Islam is jihad ... The fact that jihad is a farḍ al-kifāya (the duty of a\n\ngroup of Muslims - ed.) means that even if the enemy does not attack us, we must still declare war.\n\n... That is, jihad is not a defensive war ... and we must (wajib) wage jihad with the aim of\n\nspreading Islam and Islamic appeal, even when the enemy does not attack us” (pp. 73. 74 “Hizb ut-\n\nTahrir”).\n\nAnnex 825\n\n4\n\nFurther, from this perverted understanding of Jihad, the ideologues of Hizb-ut-Tahrir describe\n\nthe relationship of the future state of the Caliphate with the kufr states, “that is, with those where the\n\nlaws of Islam are not executed, but the laws of kufr (disbelief) are fulfilled.\n\n- “All other countries of the world are considered kufr states that are Dar al-harb (countries\n\nin a state of war with the Islamic state). Relations with them are the prerogative of foreign policy\n\nand must be conducted on the basis of Sharia law, in accordance with the provisions on jihad, as\n\nwell as for the benefit of Muslims and for the good of the Caliphate” (p. 75 of “Hizb ut-Tahrir”),\n\nWe emphasize that the perverse understanding of important Islamic concepts by the Hizb-ut-\n\nTahrir ideologists lies at the heart of this perverse ideology. For example, the concept of Jihad is\n\ninterpreted by Hizb-ut-Tahrir purely on the military plane, despite its versatility.\n\nMoreover, the party calls the generally accepted Islamic understanding of Jihad distorted.\n\n- “For example, by misrepresenting jihad as a defense against attacks, rather than a war of\n\nconquest, they distorted the reality (truth) of jihad. Jihad is a war against the individual, which is\n\nan obstacle to the spread of Islamic dawa, whether it is an attacker or not. In other words, jihad is\n\nthe elimination of any obstacles to the spread of Islamic dawa or an appeal to Islam and a war on\n\nthe path of appeal, i.e. on the path of Allah. Muslims carried out a jihad against Rome, Egypt,\n\nNorth Africa, Spain, as required by the spread of Islamic Dawa and Islam. The distortion of the\n\nmeaning of jihad was due to the open defence of Islam due to the weakness in the sense of Islam's\n\nguilt and satisfaction of the accusers” (p. 11 “Concept of Hizb ut-Tahrir”).\n\n“Muslims have also lost the habit of clearly understanding the method of Islam. Muslims\n\nearlier realised: existence in this life only for the sake of Islam, the task of Muslims is to spread\n\nIslam, the duty of the Islamic state to implement Islam and fulfill its provisions inside and spread\n\nIslam outside the country, the method of which is jihad” (p. 5 “Concept of Hizb ut-Tahrir”).\n\n- “Jihad differs from this in that, being a war with the enemy and as a material act, it leads\n\nto a tangible result, like conquering a fortress or killing an enemy, although the goal of a Mujahid\n\nwas the realization of spiritual value ...\n\nTherefore, the very invocation of a Mujahid to Allah is not a method of jihad, just as only a\n\ncommandment (instruction!!!) for him will not be a method of suppressing a thief” (p. 55 “Hizb ut-\n\nTahrir”),\n\n“Therefore, Hizb-ut-Tahrir observes frankness, courage, clarity and challenges everything\n\nthat contradicts Islam from systems, religions, ideologies, thoughts, concepts, laws, traditions and\n\ncustoms, and even if it has to face the anger and hatred of people who have the above thoughts,\n\neven if people who have these thoughts oppose him, they will begin to fight against him.\n\nHizb-ut-Tahrir does not please anyone in matters concerning Islam and does not tell people\n\nwho possess these religions, ideologies, systems, thoughts and carry out a non-Islamic call to keep\n\ntheir views, but on the contrary requires them to give up what they carry with them, because it is\n\nkufr and a delusion and requires them to accept Islam, because Islam is the only correct one. Hizbut-\n\nTahrir believes that all religions except Islam, such as Judaism, Christianity, are kufr religions\n\nand all systems other than Islam such as socialist (communist) and capitalist are kufr systems. It\n\nalso believes that a call to nationalism, patriotism, sectarian fanaticism and regionalism is what\n\nIslam prohibits, as he believes that Islam prohibits Muslims from creating parties that call for\n\ncapitalism, socialism, communism or secularism or nationalism, patriotism , regionalism or any\n\nreligion other than Islam, as well as belonging to any of these parties, as well as being a member of\n\nthese parties. Also, Hizb-ut-Tahrir does not flatter or please the rulers and does not show friendship\n\nto them and to their constitutions and laws ... On the contrary. Hizb-ut-Tahrir chastises and sharply\n\nAnnex 825\n\n5\n\ncriticizes them and believes that the laws they enforce are the laws of kufr and demands that they\n\ndestroy these laws and replace them with the laws of Islam .... whoever denies the suitability of\n\nIslam and even any Islamic law Hizb-ut-Tahrir is considered a kafir. Hizb-ut-Tahrir does not\n\naccept complicity in their rule, since this is complicity in the rule of kufr, just as it does not help\n\nthem in the implementation of economic reform, or educational, or social, or moral, since this\n\nassistance is a help for ẓā lām (unjust) and to strengthen them and lengthen the term of their vicious\n\nand kafir laws, on the contrary, Hizb-ut-Tahrir works to eradicate them, and to eradicate the laws\n\nof kufr, which they apply over Muslims in order to return the laws of Islam to execution and\n\napplication” (pp. 22, 23 “Program of Hizb-ut-Tahrir”),\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n1. The ideology of Hizb-ut-Tahrir differs significantly from the traditional understanding of\n\nIslam.\n\n2. Hizb-ut-Tahrir does not recognise and declares states that do not live according to the laws\n\nof Sharia “the state of kufr” (unbelief), against which it is necessary to conduct a military Jihad.\n\n3. Hizb-ut-Tahrir calls for the overthrow of any state system and system of state power in\n\nthose countries where this party operates.\n\n4. The overthrow of the government and the method of establishing an Islamic state of the\n\nCaliphate, carrying its ideology, this organisation sees in the commission of a military Jihad, that is,\n\nwar.\n\n5. The conduct of a military Jihad, the establishment of Islamic rule around the world and in\n\neach of the regions of the world in particular, provides for forcing the citizens of the states of the\n\nHizb-ut-Tahrir activity to abandon their religions and cultures in favor of Islam.\n\nMufti of Muslims of Crimea /Signature/ E.

This practice is\n\nespecially widespread in the republics of Northern Caucasus. According to some sources, in Dagestan, about\n\n20,000 people have been put in this registry41. Preventive registry implies being summoned to the police,\n\ninterrogations, compulsory fingerprint taking and biological material collection for the purposes of genome\n\ninformation processing. At the same time, being in such preventive registry creates difficulties in travelling\n\nacross the republic, employment and results in other restrictions of rights of individuals. The reasons for their\n\ninclusion in the registry often include attendance of mosques, which are considered “Wahhabbite”, to perform\n\nrites, family or neighbourly relations or acquaintance with the people suspected of religious extremism, etc.\n\nMoreover, anonymous reports or denouncements by neighbours serve as the grounds for inclusion in the\n\npreventive registry.\n\n[…]\n\nPage 44\n\n[...]\n\n2.

The movement\n\nwas represented by various initiative groups, some activists of which in the spring of 1987\n\ncreated the so-called Central Initiative Group (CIG), where Mustafa Dzhemilev played a\n\nmajor role. Later, in 1989 this group became the core of the Organization of the Crimean\n\nTatar National Movement (OCTNM). Initiative groups from Fergana Valley, Tashkent,\n\nSamarkand, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Novorossiysk, and southern Ukraine were\n\nnot included in the CIG, remaining in the format of the unified National Movement of\n\nCrimean Tatars (NMCT).\n\nThere were serious and fundamental disagreements between the traditional National\n\nMovement of the Crimean Tatars and the OCTNM. NMCT was advocating for the\n\nrestoration of the Crimean ASSR according to the decree of 1921 and counted on the\n\nassistance of the USSR leadership in this, whereas OCTNM strongly opposed the Soviet\n\nsystem as such.\n\nDzhemilev immediately adopted the tactics of confrontation with the authorities and law\n\nenforcement bodies. In 1991, with support of local Crimean authorities the National\n\nCongress (Qurultay) of Crimean Tatars was held; its decisions caused aggravation of interethnic\n\ntension in Crimea. The Qurultay created a special body, the Mejlis of the Crimean\n\nTatar People, which began acting as Crimean shadow government.\n\nOn the contrary, NMCT tried to find a way to ensure that the return of Crimean Tatars to\n\ntheir historical homeland would not turn into a new tragedy for the people, would not\n\nprovoke a bloody conflict. Yuri Osmanov accused his radically-minded opponents of\n\nseeking short-term political success, which could result in Crimean Tatars becoming\n\nunwelcome guests in their own land. He was convinced that his opponents from OCTNM\n\nwere driven more by power and profit than concern for the future of their people.\n\nHowever, soon Yuri Bekirovich and the NMCT were suspended from their activities for\n\nopposing the Crimean authorities’ misuse of funds allocated from the budget of the USSR.\n\nAccordingly, the organized return of Crimean Tatars was effectively thwarted, and\n\nspontaneous return, unauthorized seizure of land plots, and conflicts between Crimean\n\nTatars and the authorities began.\n\nAnnex 830\n\n2\n\nAfter his ouster, Yuri Osmanov devoted his work to the prevention of possible ethnic and\n\nsocial conflict situations related to the mass return of Crimean Tatars to Crimea. It soon\n\nturned out that while Osmanov and his associates in Crimea were working to rule out any\n\nethnic conflicts, the leader of the Mejlis cried out about the “inevitability of armed clashes\n\nbetween Crimean Tatars and the Russian population in Crimea”, spoke of the readiness of\n\nCrimean Tatars to take up arms and actually urged Turkish authorities to interfere in\n\nCrimean affairs. Osmanov went to the editors of the newspapers that had published the\n\ninterview with Dzhemilev and protested against such publications...\n\nSoon after, on the night of 6 to 7 November 1993, Yuri Osmanov was severely beaten and\n\ndied from his injuries. The death of a bright leader capable of developing political theory\n\nand turning it into practical action led to the virtual demise of the NMCT. Thus, Dzhemilev\n\nbecame the sole “leader” of the Crimean Tatar people...\n\nToday, the words of Yuri Bekirovich [Osmanov] about the Mejlis sound as relevant as ever:\n\n“...The Mejlis was meant to inflame the non-Tatar population in Crimea by hysterical,\n\nopenly provocative and absolutely useless ‘physical’ campaigns and scandals. All of these\n\ncampaigns were risky undertakings that have been played out exclusively for the empire’s\n\nown interests or the plans for great national and political intrigues... The Mejlis is trade and\n\narrangement of business affairs on the plight of the people”.\n\n[...]\n\nAnnex 830\n\nAnnex 831\n\nCharter of the Regional Non-Governmental Organisation “Ukrainian\n\nCommunity of Crimea”, 2018 (excerpts)\n\nTranslation\n\nExcerpts\n\nThe Charter approved by the General\n\nMeeting of Members\n\nMinutes of the Meeting of 5 March 2018\n\nCHARTER\n\nOF THE REGIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION\n\n“UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY OF CRIMEA”\n\n(new edition)\n\nArticle 1.

Spiritual elite of the Crimean Tatar people, who gained fame throughout the Muslim\n\nworld, was educated in the Zincirli Madrasa. They taught logic, Arabic philology, philosophy, law, rhetoric,\n\nmathematics, astronomy and many other sciences at the madrasa. There was a mosque, the tomb of its\n\nbuilder and the graves of leading clergy and laic intelligentsia on the madrasa territory.

He is buried\n\non the territory of the complex.\n\nThe religious and cult complex Zincirli Madrasa is of great importance for the development of Islamic\n\neducation in the Russian Federation, and in particular in Crimea. Previously, President of the Russian\n\nFederation Vladimir Putin noted the importance of the revival of Islamic education in Russia. “Islamic\n\neducation has always been very profound and had a long history,” he stressed. “Before the 1917 revolution,\n\nRussian Muslim theologians were recognised all over the world as respected people, their opinion was highly\n\nvalued.” “The government will continue to support Islamic education in Russia,” the Head of state assured.\n\nThis Order of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea is a vivid confirmation of the words of the\n\nPresident of the Russian Federation.\n\nPress service of the Centralised Religious Organisation Spiritual Directorate of Muslims of Crimea\n\nAnnex 832\n\nAnnex 833\n\nSpiritual Directorate of Muslims of the Republic of Crimea and the\n\nCity of Sevastopol (Taurida Muftiyat) official website, “Sergey\n\nAksyonov, Head of Crimea, discussed the progress of restoration works\n\nat the Khan’s Palace with the Council of Crimean Tatars (PHOTO)”,\n\n1 August 2019\n\n1\n\nTranslation\n\nCentralised Religious Organisation\n\nSpiritual Directorate of Muslims of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol\n\n(Taurida Muftiyat)\n\nSergey Aksyonov, Head of Crimea, discussed the progress of restoration works at the Khan’s Palace\n\nwith the Council of Crimean Tatars (PHOTO)\n\nSource: https://qmdi.org/glava-kryma-sergej-aksenov-obsudil-s-sovetom-krymskih-tatar-hodrestavratsionnyh-\n\nrabot-v-hanskom-dvortse-foto/\n\nPublished: 1 August 2019\n\nHajji Emirali Ablaev, Mufti of Crimea took part in a meeting with\n\nSergey Aksyonov, the Head of the Republic of Crimea on the issue of\n\nemergency and repair and restoration works in the Khan Palace of the\n\nBakhchisaray Historical, Cultural and Archaeological Reserve Museum.\n\n“We have agreed that, within the framework of the meeting of the Council of Crimean Tatars, we\n\nwill discuss the construction and reconstruction of landmark objects that relate to the culture and\n\ntraditions of the Crimean Tatar people.

Good day! Hello!\n\nThe spring of 2014 brought changes to Crimea which Crimean Tatars have been dreaming about for\n\ndecades.\n\nFirst of all, on 11 April, the Crimean Tatar language acquired the status of the official language in the\n\nRepublic, along with Russian and Ukrainian.\n\nSecondly, the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin on the rehabilitation of\n\nCrimean Tatar, Armenian, German, Greek and other ethnicities of Crimea was issued.\n\nThe result of these long-awaited actions has been the rapid development of the national media. The\n\nfirst to be created was “Public Crimean Tatar Television and Radio Company”. It includes the TV channel\n\n“Millet” and radio “Vatan Sedasy”.\n\nThe television and radio company covers the social, political, economic and cultural life of Crimea.\n\nPromptly informs about events on the peninsula and beyond in two state languages: Russian and Crimean\n\nTatar. Thanks to “Millet”, the Crimean Tatar language and culture are being preserved and developed. The\n\naudience of “Millet” television and radio company is increasing every day. The content of the programs,\n\nunlike the content of the programs of our Ukrainian colleagues, does not bear insults to other states, is not a\n\nsource of interethnic tensions and political uneasiness.\n\nCrimean Tatars have something to compare with. And the comparisons are in favor of Russia. This is\n\nevidenced by the results of direct regional elections of deputies at all levels. More than 200 Crimean Tatars\n\nwill represent their people in various branches of government.\n\nI would also like to urge the OSCE to pay attention to a number of vital issues for the Crimeans.\n\n1. All the OSCE participating States acknowledge that everyone has rights from birth. Human rights\n\nare indivisible and guaranteed by law.\n\nAnd only Ukraine ignored this fact, organising water, transport, energy blockades to the residents of\n\nCrimea. Why were other countries silent? Or is blockade becoming an international norm?\n\nWe have successfully dealt with this and are moving forward - the Crimean bridge, the airport, the\n\nTaurida highway have been built!\n\n2. Every year the tourist flow from Ukraine to Crimea only increases, guests are amazed at the\n\nqualitative changes taking place on the peninsula. We are for freedom of movement. This is one of the\n\nfundamental freedoms of citizens. At the same time, residents of Crimea cannot travel to a number of\n\ncountries with their Russian passports. Don't you think that such double standards in relation to Crimea\n\ncontradict the fundamental principles of this organisation?\n\nI urge you to follow the example of China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, which are actively working with\n\nCrimea and granting visas to its residents.\n\nI began my report with the Constitution of Crimea, and I want to end this statement with it. For many\n\nyears, my people dreamed of this constitution, of consolidating the status of the official language for the\n\nCrimean Tatar language, as well as of the Cathedral Mosque. Look at all them! We have finally achieved\n\nwhat we wanted! As the great ideologist Ismail Gasprinsky said: “It is known that unity is strength, and\n\ndiscord is the death of people in general and in all spheres of life.” And it is for a good reason that the\n\nCrimean coat of arms says - Prosperity in unity, we live by this principle.\n\nI have brought with me a documentary film about the Russian Crimea. It reflects the five-year period\n\nof recovery and prosperity of the peninsula. This film was prepared by my colleagues and translated into\n\nEnglish. I am ready to pass it on to everyone to get acquainted with the real situation in our region.\n\nMusaev Ervin - General Director of the Autonomous Non-Commercial Organisation “Public Crimean Tatar\n\nTelevision and Radio Company” Republic of Crimea, Russian Federation\n\nAnnex 834\n\n2\n\nAddress to the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media\n\nWarsaw, 17 September 2019\n\nSpeaking out for equal partnership and professional dialogue between journalists from different\n\ncountries, accepting the supremacy of morality, integrity and journalistic ethics, Crimean journalists claim\n\nthat materials about the life of modern Crimea in Ukrainian and Western mass media are a gross distortion of\n\nreality. At the same time, violations of journalistic ethics remain outside the field of vision of the UN and\n\nOSCE. At the same time, some “human rights activists” continue to assert from the high rostrum about the\n\nalleged “facts of systematic violation of the rights and freedoms of Ukrainian journalists working in the\n\noccupied Crimea”.\n\nWe, journalists of Crimea, declare that we work in a calm atmosphere and systematically develop the\n\nmedia space of Crimea. We sincerely wish such work to our colleagues in other countries, primarily in\n\nUkraine, where killings and repressions against journalists have become widespread.\n\nCrimean journalists are open to dialogue, cooperation and equal partnership with their colleagues from\n\nall over the world. We invite the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media to visit Crimea and see for\n\nyourself the freedom of speech, which is fully enjoyed by our editorial offices and journalists.\n\nNot accepting and resolutely rejecting the language of political blackmail and ultimatums, we will\n\nalways be happy to receive intergovernmental and interparliamentary delegations, fellow journalists in\n\nCrimea, to create the most comfortable working conditions for them, familiarize them with all aspects of life\n\nof the Crimeans, and also to attract to cooperation in protecting the rights of journalists in those European\n\ncountries that need it.\n\nIn particular, Crimean journalists express extreme concern over the fate of their colleague from\n\nLithuania Algirdas Paleckis, who is being prosecuted by the Lithuanian authorities on a trumped-up charge\n\nof spying for Russia, while the journalist himself openly states that he acted within his competence,\n\nconducting a journalistic investigation of the events of 13 January 1991 in Vilnius.\n\nWe are seriously worried about attempts to continue prosecution of Polish public figure and journalist\n\nMateusz Piskorski in Warsaw, arrests and groundless accusations of spying of Bulgarian journalists and\n\nRussophiles Nikolay Malinov and Yuri Borisov.\n\nWe require the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media to conduct a comprehensive\n\ninvestigation of the legality of the prosecution of Algirdas Paleckis in Lithuania, Mateusz Piskorski in\n\nPoland, Nikolay Malinov and Yuri Borisov in Bulgaria and to report to the OSCE High Commissioner for\n\nHuman Rights on these issues.\n\nAnnex 834\n\nAnnex 835\n\nOSCE Human dimension implementation meeting (Warsaw,\n\n16-27 September 2019), Written Contribution by the Spiritual\n\nDirectorate of Muslims of Crimea, HDIM.CS/0404/19/EN,\n\n24 September 2019\n\nTranslation\n\nHDIM.CS/0404/19/EN\n\n24 September 2019\n\nDear Friends! After many years of stagnation, the Republic of Crimea is actively reviving. Along with\n\ninfrastructural changes, spiritual institutions, aimed at ensuring the freedom of religion and security of the\n\nreligious life of Muslims, are rapidly developing and strengthening.\n\nOver the past 5 years, more than 40 mosques have been built. Construction of the long-awaited cathedral\n\nmosque in Simferopol for 4 thousand people has begun and shall be completed soon.\n\nAll over Crimea, there are more than 300 functioning mosques and prayer houses, which are freely visited by\n\nMuslims and guests of Crimea. More than 400 people, imams and religious teachers are directly engaged in\n\npreaching the traditional values of Islam. During the year, more than 5,000 people have taken courses of Islam.\n\nA young team of religious leaders serves for the benefit of the society, conduct lectures, courses and religious\n\nrituals day and night. The call for the five-time prayer can be heard without hindrance from minarets at day\n\nand night time. Both male and female religious seminaries-madrasas function. There is no pressure or\n\noppression in the matter of confession and preaching religion.\n\nSuch sacred objects as the complex of Zincirli Madrasa and Orta Madrasa in Bakhchisaray, and Tekie of\n\ndervishes in Evpatoria have been returned to the Crimean Muslims.\n\nEvery year, more and more people go on pilgrimage from Crimea. Residents of Crimea rest on Muslim\n\nholidays, because Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are official holidays in the Republic of Crimea.\n\nA few words about positive changes in the field of secular education. The Crimean Engineering and\n\nPedagogical University is a symbol of interethnic harmony in Crimea. More than 6,000 people are educated\n\nthere, of which more than 60% are Crimean Tatars. The state's concern for education was manifested in the\n\ncomplete modernisation of the material and technical base of the university. Construction of a multi-ethnic\n\ncomplex is being completed. It includes a dormitory for 1,000 people, a library and sports halls. Graduates of\n\nthis university are in demand and meet the needs of the state in personnel.\n\nAt the same time, the problem of combating extremist religious sects, such as Wahabism, Hizb ut-Tahrir and\n\nHabaism, remains urgent in the Crimea. These sects began to penetrate and spread in Crimea in the late 90s,\n\nwith the tacit consent and complicity of authorities. Despite the efforts of the Muftiyat, cells of these destructive\n\ngroups were registered as autonomous religious organisations.\n\nThe problem is that these movements are fighting against traditional Islam, distorting it, using the religion for\n\npolitical purposes, creating a split in the Muslim community of Crimea, radicalising young people, and creating\n\nground for inter-religious and inter-ethnic conflicts. Speaking of Hizb ut-Tahrir, this party is banned in many\n\ncountries of the world, including Muslim ones. Adherents of the Hizb ut-Tahrir party talk about the need to\n\nreformat the state system, about unacceptability of the democratic structure of the state, oppose Muslims to\n\nrepresentatives of other religions, deny political and religious freedoms of a person.\n\nIn 2013, the European Court of Human Rights made a conclusion that the aim of the party was clearly contrary\n\nto the values of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nWhat our opponents are trying to present as repression against Muslims in Crimea is nothing more than a\n\ncriminal prosecution of adherents of this very marginal Hizb ut-Tahrir party, which was banned in Russia in\n\n2003. They are being tried under Article 205.5 of the Criminal Code for organising and participating in\n\nactivities of the terrorist organisation.\n\nThe Muftiyat of Crimea protects the traditional values of Islam, protects the Muslims of Crimea from the\n\ninfluence of alien extremist and terrorist ideologies, and thus ensures peace and interfaith harmony in Crimea.\n\nAnnex 835\n\nAnnex 836\n\nUkrainian Institute of Politics, “Dynamics of the number of schools and\n\nstudents by language of instruction”, 5 June 2020\n\n1\n\nTranslation\n\nUkrainian Institute of Politics\n\nSource: https://uiamp.org.ua/isl/dinamika-kolichestva-shkol-i-uchenikov-po-yazykam-obucheniya\n\nDynamics of the number of schools and students by language of instruction\n\nIndividual UIP ratings\n\n1. The number of students and schools in Ukraine.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 4 million students in Ukraine studying in almost 15 thousand schools.\n\nOf these, 3 million 753 thousand are taught in the Ukrainian language (92% of the total number of\n\nstudents), 281 thousand - in Russian (6.9%), 17.1 thousand - in Hungarian (0.42%), 16 thousand - in\n\nRomanian (0.4%), 2.5 thousand - in Moldovan and 1.7 thousand - in Polish .\n\nThe number of schools with these languages of instruction goes almost in the same order: in\n\nUkraine in 2020, there were almost 15 thousand schools, of which – 13,584 with instruction in\n\nUkrainian (92% of the total number of schools), 125 - instruction in Russian (0.85% - less than 1%\n\nof schools accommodate 6.9% of students studying in Russian), 72 - in Hungarian (0.49%), 68 - in\n\nRomanian (0.46%), 4 - in Polish, 2 - in Moldavian. That is, with almost a thousand more students\n\nstudying in the Moldovan language, there are only 2 educational institutions with the Moldovan\n\nlanguage of instruction, and twice as many with Polish - 4.\n\nThe total number of schools in Ukraine has been decreasing all this time, and the largest decrease in\n\ntheir number was in 2014:\n\nOverall, the number of schools declined from 2004 to 2020 by 6,276 educational institutions, or by\n\n29.8% of the 2004 indicator. After the loss of control over the territories of Crimea and Separate\n\nAreas of Donetsk and Luhansk Regions from 2015 to 2020, the number of schools in Ukraine\n\ndecreased by 2,332.\n\nAnnex 836\n\n2\n\nThe total decrease of the population in Ukraine from 2004 to 2020 amounted to 5,720 thousand\n\npeople, or 12% of the 2004 indicator. At the same time, the number of schools also decreased (from\n\n21,034 in 2004 to 14,758 in 2020 - by 29.8%), which can be explained not only by the densification\n\nof classes, but also by the decrease in the number of children in the country and the general aging of\n\nthe population. In addition, the absence of population census since 2001 plays a role here: without\n\ncensus, data on the population may be inaccurate.\n\nIn Ukraine, after a period of decline from 2004 to 2014, the number of students studying in the\n\nUkrainian language began to increase: from 3.28 million to 3.75 million people - by 14.4% with\n\nthe number of schools decreasing by more than 2,000: from 15,696 to 13,584, which, however, fits\n\nin the previous tendency of decreasing of the number of schools. Considering the increase in the\n\nnumber of students that are studying in the Ukrainian language, while the number of schools is\n\ndecreasing, we can state the fact of classes condensing from an average of 204 students pe"
