        "text": "I’ve never been the lithest of athletes – think Gary Pallister’s rosy puffing cheeks after two minutes – but this was something else. The centre-forward on the sun-drenched pitch in front of me was, in the kindest possible way, fat; the neck rolls and potruding stomach were sprouting forth from around the edges of his awfully fitted shirt, and as if to flick a nonchalant two fingers at professionalism, a cigarette clung on to his lips as it burned gradually to the filter. To say this guy didn’t care would be an understatement, although this was a world and a half away from the rebellious cool of James Dean. Shrek, as my wife rather accurately nicknamed him, was strutting his less than graceful stuff as the central sporting commemorations on the most important day in the Russian Calendar, Victory Day, playing the world’s most popular sport, football, but everything just felt surreal.\n\nRussia of course will host the FIFA World Cup in only three years, but I am a slightly worried about the reception it will get. Not from the outside world, which will no doubt be dominated by the racism-and-homphobia rhetoric throughout, but from the locals themselves. The success of a tournament depends on the enthusiasm and passion of the host’s citizens as much as anything, and as Shrek himself demonstrated a few years ago, there is a curious relationship Russians have with the sport. If you were to attend a football match in what English people would consider the reasonably-sized city of Tyumen, where I live, you would be treated to a futuristic design, marbled floors, chrome bannisters, huge screens, and a sweeping, open-plan Premier League-standard stadium capable of holding 13,050 spectators. The one notable omission, however, would be actual people.\n\nLet’s put this in perspective. Tyumen is a city of at least 700,000 inhabitants, and the nearest major urban area, or at least one with a professional football team, is Ekaterinburg, about the distance from Manchester to London away. Competition for fans, one would assume, shouldn’t be a problem. FC Tyumen have a fascinating, undulating and unique history, and currently reside in the national second tier with a Brazilian magician, Cleyton, on loan from Académica in Portugal. Average attendances, however, have hovered around the 1,500 mark, and the most inspiring chant translates as “We need a goal!”. As the kids would say nowadays, ‘Facepalm’…\n\nParticipation is a slightly more complex area to dissect. For obvious reasons, eleven-a-side football is impractical for most of the year, so futsal is a very prominent sport, both from spectating and playing points of view. In fact, MFC Tyumen are one of the strongest teams in the Russian Super League, while Sinara Ekaterinburg won the futsal equivalent of the Champions League a few years ago. I make the pilgrimage to the neighbouring village of Burovskiy, a town founded near the end of the war, most weekends to play with students and friends, and although my contribution is, ahem, not spectacular, the level of the Russians who run rings around me is impressive. Their insistence on the strictest professional rules being adhered is both comical and laudable in equal measures; you would not believe the endless ‘grannies’ meetings’ held over what exactly constitutes five yards, but their passion for the shortened form of the game is clear.\n\nThe facilities are basic but sufficient, and we love them, despite the god-awful stench from the strange toilet and the original 1940s showers overrun by limescale. Even in a fairly nondescript place a few kilometres outside a city, this gym hall is only part of a fully-equipped sports centre with a swimming pool, Russian ‘banya’ and gymnastics hall. The provisions for pursuing athletic past times is impressive; a throwback to the Soviet era of mass participation and physical fitness. The ethos of taking part is still alive and well, so the issue is not on the playing side of football.\n\nSo what IS the problem? Last year’s exasperated FC Tyumen marketting manager told me “Tyumen is just not a football city” when trying to explain the lack of support for such a popular sport. I don’t see this as being the case, though; I believe it is more to do with the nationwide apathy to their own ‘stars’. Hockey is more broadly followed when it comes to the national team, and the attitudes of overpaid, over-the-hill stars such as Andrey Arshavin, Yuriy Zhirkov and Roman Pavlyuchenko certainly doesn’t help. Maybe there is something more unique to Tyumen that might explain this issue though.\n\nAnother chant that is often heard in the stands of the magnificent Geolog Stadium is “First Siberian City!”. This needs some quantifying. Tyumen was the first permanent fortress established by the legendary Cossack commander Yermak, although there were other fortified settlements around the same time, such as Tobolsk, birthplace of the creator of the periodic table – and discoverer of the ideal alcoholic content of vodka – Dmitry Mendeleev. The family of the last Tsar, Nikolai II, were imprisoned there in one of Russia’s last remaining stone-built Kremlins before their brutal execution in Ekaterinburg in 1918. Modern times have seen Tyumen blossom with the oil industry bringing enormous investment into the town, thanks to the greatest concentration of Russia’s oil fields being within the oblast, with an increasing number of foreign companies setting down roots in the city. There is still a label, however, half self-depracating and half-insulting, that clings to Tyumen; the Capital of Villages.\n\nA survey of locals has explained this epithet as a nod to the not so distant past when the current city was made up of a collection of villages on the Tura river, which was for centuries one of the main arteries on the Silk Road between the far East and Europe. One local resident said that the title was something that Tyumenski folk could say to each other to mock themselves, but that coming from outsiders came across as an insult, referring to the city as an under-developed country bumkin type of place. This fine balance between flatly accepting their limitations, and proudly broadcasting their achievements, seems to be at the heart of what it is to be from Tyumen. I don’t profess to have fully understood the entire psyche of the people here, but there is certainly a brand of shoulder shrugging when it comes to problems that I believe translates into football following.\n\nThere is undoubted charm in the pastel-coloured wooden houses that resolutely stand between gleaming glass tower blocks throughout even the very centre of the city, but it has a feel of odd incompletion. I have never seen such a juxtaposition of architectural styles. Is it a refusal to let go of the past, or a lack of effort to finish developing? As with all things in Russia, there is no simple answer, but for a physical representation of the character of the people, you could do much worse than take a look at the simple rustic reminders of centuries past.\n\nIt is pouring. Not just a thick blanket of rain, but heavy drops that drum a repetitive beat on every surface. It is unseasonably chilly, and I am starting to question the wisdom of leaving the warm, cosy comfort of our flat. Without meaning to brag, I consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to precipitation – I grew up near Manchester after all, and spent my formative years running around English school playgrounds in shorts – and this was the type of weather that saps the life force out of you. Everyone is soaked to the bone, but they don’t care because it is the most significant and important day of the year in Russia: Victory Day.\n\nNow when you visit a new country, much more when you actually settle there, I firmly believe that if you don’t know about the history or traditions, you should try to learn about them. My knowledge of Russia in almost all spheres was embarassingly poor prior to my arrival; I am ashamed to admit that I knew about the city of Volgograd thanks to their football team knocking out Manchester United from the UEFA Cup in 1995 despite Peter Schmeichel scoring a header at Old Trafford, and not because it was the site of the singular most brutal, devastating and decisive battles of the Great Patriotic War that lasted about 18 months and claimed up to 2 million lives. So I quickly set about asking my new friends to explain the major days (of which there are many in Russia), and first on the list was the day that marked the end of hositilities against Nazi Germany. I expected to hear about a sombre day of reflection, perhaps of church services and a reflective mood.\n\nMy grandparents served slightly unusual roles in the Second World War, but like all others, witnessed horrific losses. My paternal grandfather served in India, returning with an appreciation for curry that skipped a generation, while my late maternal grandfather helped plan the D-Day landing craft, and also served in a legal department in Rome and Vienna, the latter seeing him accomodated in the stunning Schoenbrun Palace. One common misconception that many major western newspapers have made today, however, is that the Second World War is the exact same thing as the Great Patriotic War; it is not. While we recognise Remembrance Sunday in acknowledgement of the signing of the armistace on 11 November, Russians celebrate, and celebrate is definitely the appropriate word, their victory in the hostilities in which they took part.\n\nYou may have seen pictures in the news of Moscow’s impressive display of military personnel and weaponary, especially the impressive brand new Armata tanks and the RS-24 Yars ICBM launchers. In light of the past 18 months, it comes as a thinly-veiled show of force under the cover of celebrating Russia’s victorious participation in the Great Patriotic War that ended 70 years ago. Never one to miss an opportunity, Mr Putin criticised US foreign policy in his Red Square address, and even went to great lengths to ensure the day would pass with clear skies by seeding silver iodide, liquid nitrogen and dry ice into clouds surrounding the capital to induce early rainfall before the 9th of May, as he has done on previous occassions. In this case, every cloud really does have a silver lining.\n\nNo such luck here in Tyumen. Three years ago, however, there was no need for intervention with the weather. As my wife and I walked with our 8-month-old daughter Sophia in the blazing sunshine, we had a brief but unforgettable encounter with a veteran who crossed our path. The old woman, weighed down considerably by her medals, peered inside the pram and smiled as she said; “I hope she never has to see a conflict like I had to.” And off she went, never to be seen by us again. I was so touched by here sincerity, but also by her lightness of expression that I will never forget those few moments.\n\nThat exchange summed up for me the mood of the day. A year earlier, my first in Tyumen, I had been invited to join in the parade that forms the central part of the celebrations across the country. The central avenue of the city, Ulitsa Respubliki, is completely cordened off to allow a procession made up of soldiers in full dress uniform and different branches of society such as students representing their university or even companies piggybacking the fervour to promote themselves. They make their way past some temporary stands in front of the city and regional government buildings where all veterans are invited to sit in in the shadow of the vast statue of Lenin. Everyone was waving flags and wearing the symbol of Victory Day, an orange and black striped ribbon, while cheering and chanting. Wreathes are laid against the city’s two ‘Eternal Flames’, where the names of all Tyumen residents who gave their lives to defend their country are immortalised on huge slabs of granite, but that’s where the similarities to Remembrance Sunday end.\n\nThe ribbon, interestingly, is named after St. George. It seems wherever I go St George follows me; in Italy, I lived in Ferrara in the northern region of Emilia Romagna, a city whose patron saint is also St George. The use of it as a symbol specifically for Russia’s Victory Day is relatively new one, and thanks to separatists in the Donetsk region of Ukraine – where the colours are also traditional – it has been viewed by some as a symbol of aggressive nationalistic support. This is despite its history dating back to the eighteenth century when it was part of the highest military decoration of Imperial Russia, the Order of St George, although then the colours were yellow and black, before they were changed to the current design in 1917.\n\nThere is certainly an element of the ribbon being used as a badge of patriotic pride by extreme right wing groups, but why should all people be lumped into one group? Through the sheets of chilling Siberian rain today, I saw plenty of genuine gratitude towards the ancestors who had fought for their country. Veterans walked proudly in pristine uniforms, students were dressed in traditional outfits, and people huddled around restored wartime vehicles and held pictures of their departed loved ones. Wagons with vats of piping hot ‘grechka’ (buckwheat) and pork, tea and bread rolls were surrounded by people of all ages as they were dished out for free. It obviously wasn’t exactly the same as what it must have been like in the time of rationing, but the collective spirit and unity was.\n\nI was initially unsure how to approach a day as uniquely Russian as this. In the five years I have been here, I have decided that I can justify celebrating it too, as my wife’s family showed the courage to protect the land I now call home. Baba Valya is the sole surviving veteran in my family, and she was not even a teenager during the war itself, but she left school to work in the factories producing clothing for the armed forces. She has told me that she felt she would get a better education learning how to live and survive in such times, and by doing what she could to support her countrymen. Her upbringing has without doubt formed her character as a protector of her family – she still grows vegetables and fruit in her garden for us all, and adores her great grandchildren – and for that, I will be forever grateful.\n\nSometimes you have to look at yourself in the mirror and ask: what the hell were you thinking?\n\nI am sitting in what is fast becoming my regular seat at Moscow’s Domodedovo airport, and I am alone. I don’t have an exotic final destination, not even England. Nope, having got up in the hazy dawn of Tyumen, I have flown to this bustling metropolis only to fly straight back in the dead of night later. My wife and daughters are returning from their holiday in England, and I am making a 24-hour return journey across three time zones just to meet them halfway.\n\nOriginally the plan was to save my wife looking after two toddlers on her own, which any parent will tell you is no easy task when travelling such long distances. Return tickets from our home city just east of the Ural mountains to Moscow can be ridiculously cheap (think easyjet prices 10 years ago), so I thought why not? I wanted to do something to really help my wife, as although she is superhuman and can multi-task better than anyone, it would help send her off on a more relaxed note to start her break. Right now, though, I’m not ashamed to admit that sitting in an airport for nearly 16 hours only to go back the way I came is just nuts.\n\nWhen my girls left Tyumen three weeks ago, I was left with an empty, quiet house. Well, it wasn’t quite empty – Kate had cooked some food for me before she left. Nothing unusual, you might say. Well, there wouldn’t be if it was just one dish; my wife, however, is Russian. This means that not only did she cook a tray of lasagna, she also made a chicken casserole with rice, a large chicken and vegetable quiche, pork layered with onions, carrots and potato, some cheese bagels, a bowl of scones and 12 chocolate cupcakes. In one afternoon. While also looking after our daughters. And packing their suitcases.\n\nDo you see what I mean about her being superhuman? Of course there is every possibility that I am simply the luckiest man alive to find an individual like my wife, that she is an exception to the rule, but after my half decade in Russia I suspect that it is not quite as simple as this. There are a million ways to try to analyse Russian people, in particular the role of women in the family, but let’s take one of my favourites – the dinner table.\n\nThe relationship Russian people have with food is spectacularly unique, from the efficiency with which no food is wasted to the incredible hospitality of even the simplest social occassion, but more striking still is how men and women react to each other in the context of food. In my first month here, my all-female class stared at me in disbelief when I revealed that I was living alone. “How do you eat?” they asked me. I shrugged my shoulders – unwilling to admit that I turned to Doshirak noodles, pasta and crisps most evenings – and was greeted next lesson by two tupperware containers of wholesome homecooked food. The strangest thing about this for me was that my students didn’t give me their help out of pity, but out of a sense of simple obligation, as if it was their completely normal duty to help a single man out.\n\nI have packed in my horrific diet since then, partly because I noticed the nuclear glow of the water around the Doshirak, and partly because it is impossible to eat poorly as a married man in this country. At times, waves of guilt at the pampering I receive from my wife wash over me. I dread falling into a chauvenistic 1950s laziness where I expect my wife to cook for me simply because she is my wife, but I am slowly starting to realise that she simply doesn’t see it that way. Russian hospitality, on all levels, is about taking pride in your ability to treat your guests as well as possible, and this extends to family life.\n\nJust before I started dating my wife, she held a party where she cooked seafood pasta for about ten people. Everybody received a healthy portion, but when my plate arrived it was piled so high with prawns, spaghetti and sauce that there must have been half a kilo of delicious dinner, which caused a great deal of amusement. It is true that I have a not inconsiderable (ahem…) apppetite. I once had to leave an Italian lesson because my stomach grumbles were drowning out the teacher – two double cheeseburgers later, I was able to rejoin the lesson. Right from the beginning of our relationship, she knew the way to my heart was through my stomach. Even then, though, the quantity of food was not just an attempt to impress me, but also to ensure she had fulfilled her role as a host.\n\nIt doesn’t stop with her. At regular intervals since my supply of wife-cooked food ran out about two and a half weeks ago, my mother in law has come round to cook more soup and main courses than I have ever cooked myself – seriously, anyone would think I am severely handicapped with the level of help I am given getting through the week. On Friday morning, Ira sent my wife Kate a message asking her to ask me if I needed any more food cooking, and because of my guilty conscience I just couldn’t accept any more. Of course, she came anyway and cooked chicken legs, potato and the ubiquitous dill. When I insist as strongly as possible that she needn’t wait on me hand and foot this way, she throws me a look somewhere between offence and disbelief. My parents adore my wife and dote over her almost as much as they do over my daughters Sophia and Darya, so Ira has explained to me that what she does for me is only the bare minimum she knows her daughter is being treated to when she stays with my parents. She is of course absolutely right, but it is still going to take some time to completely break down the barriers of my English reserve and fully accept this without feeling conscious.\n\nI simply can’t wait for my wife and daughters to touch down later. Three weeks may not sound like much to some people, but three weeks without a Russian wife and daughters is like three weeks for a teenager without an iPad, iPod and iPhone 6; before you knew them your life was fine, but once you have had them in your life, you can’t survive without them. After nearly a month of peace and quiet, chaos and mess will ensue, but one thing is for certain – there’s not a chance that I will be hungry.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nI recently bought a car in Tyumen, which I have been desperately looking forward to for so long. Only someone who has lived in this country using public transport will understand the frenzied excitement of being released from the evil clutches of the “Marshrutka”. Just typing the word sends shivers down my spine; the horrors I have experienced on those capsules of torture are enough to send a man insane. Just to clarify, a “marshrutka” is really just a minibus that serves the slightly less popular bus routes of our city and others around Russia; in reality, it is hell on wheels.\n\nPerhaps I am guilty of a little poetic license. There are, after all, many incarnations of the uncomfortable modes of transport around the world. Latin America, for example, has chicken buses – often old converted school buses that had gone out of service in the US. I had the dubious pleasure of using these in Honduras, but at least it really was an adventure. My most memorable journey actually did include a caged chicken as a fellow passenger, but as the beautifully calm forest views rolled towards the Carribean Sea, it was hard to even feel aggrieved about the chronic lack of legroom.\n\nSo what makes the mythical “Marshrutka” so awful? For one, the scenery – if I was able to even see out of the window – is ever so slightly less appealing. Ubiquitous building sites, stray dogs, traffic jams (how DO they always know when I will be on the bus? If I was even more cynical I’d imagine a network of spies checking my movements so they could coordinate their departures to clog up my route to work: “He’s leaving the house, go go go!”). The windows are usually too grubby or frosted over to actually make out what is beyond the confines of the mobile prison anyway.\n\nBeing a young man, however, I am obliged to stand, as the usual clientelle are either enormous amorphous mounds of human flesh with indistinguishable features, other than a moody, growling stare, or intoxicated tramps with three remaining teeth and a serious lack of hygiene, clutching a bottle of Uralski Master beer. I live near the beginning of the bus route, but pass through the busiest part of town, so I never get the luxury of sitting. Add to that the fact that I am 6″3″ (sorry, 1.88m…), I cannot stand at my full height unless I hog the spot under the sun roof, so I must crane my neck sideways while holding my lunch, work folders and whatever else I may have.\n\nRussian Stamps\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this horrific experience is now a thing of the past for me – after months of deciding, test-driving and praying, I am the proud owner of a white Hyundai Solaris. It was a proud moment when I drove out of the forecourt without having to squeeze my knees either side of the wheel of my wife’s Hyundai Getz – lovely little runner, with little being the operative word. A quick dash to the transport authorities to get a numberplate, and I would be ready to enjoy my new toy.\n\nAs I mentioned, however, I live in Russia. This means it is impossible to get anything done without a whole swathe of paperwork. OK, I told myself, for once I will accept it as a necessary hurdle. As I glanced down at the seventh or eighth form being filled in, I counted no fewer than six stamps on one page. SIX! for what possible reason could they need so many stamps?? I had to restrain myself from bursting out laughing at the serious policeman.\n\nThe truth is you can’t buy anything without a stamp attached to it somewhere. “Even the bread has a stamp,” remarked my colleague Mike, referring to the Uzbek flatbread ‘lavash’- and he’s absolutely right. I have had a receipt from a shop stamped for no other discernible reason other than it looked quite pretty. I admit it does make paperwork look more official, but it really is amusing how seriously the power of the stamp is taken when one considers how regularly corners are cut, shall we say, in these parts.\n\nOne brilliant use of the stamp was used by my other colleague called Mike (who also teaches me Russian grammar – poor soul) exactly a year ago. Last March 31, our director of studies Damian craftily sent an SMS explaining we all had to go for a medical check-up – the dreaded ‘profsmotr’ (see Tyumen Musings Part Four) – at 8am the next morning, and muggins here fell for it hook, line and sinker. Well, I turned up at the said time, and waited for half an hour until giving up and grumpily returning to the office to be greeted by my grinning boss.\n\nAfter giving Damian his moment of satisfaction, Mike turned up looking slightly concerned. He had arrived in our company relatively recently, and handed his new manager a pile of leaflets and a receipt, fully stamped, to the tune of 4,973 rubles. Given that at the time it equated to nearly £100, he asked Damian who needed to pay the money, and the garrulous Kiwi’s face fell as he realised he would have to explain to the company director that his joke would cost the company some money. Mike then let us all in on his ruse – he had simply used his fluent Russian skills and knowledge of the love of stamps brilliantly to falsify a doctor’s receipt – and we revelled in Damian’s discomfort as he scrambled around all day trying to work out a escape from the situation.\n\nInstitutionalized Socializing\n\nNot all officialdom is as pointless or as excessively used as the stamp, however. Social occassions are often run very differently here to how I am used to back in England; there is a layer of formality to proceedings that makes me wrinkle my brow a touch and wonder what is going on. Case in question: a new colleague, Jack, had just arrived, and wanted a night out, so we visited a fairly student-orientated nightclub called Hollywood. The glamour of tinsletown was conspicuous in its abscence, but in we went after chatting to some girls in the queue. Suddenly the lights went up at about 1am. Finished already? Surely not! The dance floor cleared, the music stopped, and it really seemed like that was the end of our evening.\n\nThen out came an MC, who started playing what can only be described as adult versions of children’s birthday party games. There was a place full of young adults being directed how to have fun by some loud bloke on a microphone: it was truly bizarre. These ‘showmen’ are very common at celebrations, especially weddings, where they help people socialise and have fun. Maybe this is the modern way of entertainment – in a world where people can sit across from each other in a restaurant and each have their faces buried into a screen of some description, this form of organized relaxation makes sense, I suppose.\n\nBy far my favourite custom, however, is the tradition of toasting. I recently attended a family-orientated birthday celebration of a good friend at her parents’ home, where a handful of friends and a handful of relations were squashed cosily around a table of sensational food and drink (“It only took me about three hours to prepare,” said Milya’s mum – the same superhuman hostess of Tyumen Musings Part Five fame!).\n\nEvery five minutes, the conversation was punctuated by a short speech of congratulations to the birthday girl, with both the speaker and Milya herself standing while everyone paid the utmost attention. I used to think of this habit along similar lines as the enforced entertainment MC, but I have come to love it. For me, there should be nothing embarassing about sharing a heartfelt moment with your friends and family, in amongst the laughter and general merriment. If anyone doesn’t know everbody else well, it also helps avoid too many awkward silences, and gives you a window into each person’s relationship with the host/birthday boy or girl. Each toast lasted no longer than a minute or two, but everyone, regardless of ability to speak Russian, was politely encouraged to participate in a way that was impossible to refuse.\n\nI felt moved to thank the grandparents for raising such a wonderful family; they had sat on the other side of the table, steadily necking shots of flavoured vodka all evening without any visible side effects, all the while observing and participating. The value of parents and grandparents in their respective family roles is extremely important here – my wife scolded me for not congratulating her mother when it was my wife’s birthday, and while I was initially confused, I agree with her. Thanks to the 15th toast of the evening, I was able to do just that with my friends – but thank god I was driving, otherwise I’d still be recovering now…\n\nUKRAINE.\n\nThere, that got your attention. Admittedly it’s not difficult these days with the ongoing tensions between Kiev and Moscow, and especially after opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin last week by an as-of-yet unidentified assassin from the back of a car. I’m not here to regurgitate the endless reports and editorials on the subject, however; I want to bring you a more personal side of the dynamic between these ancient peoples, a relationship that is often formed in people’s minds by mainstream media. As always with Russia, not all is as it seems at first glance.\n\nOne would assume that the recent conflict has sharpened a pre-existing rivalry between the two populations. While this may be true for some factions of society, particularly for those elements of ethnic Russians in Eastern Ukraine proclaiming a ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’, my experience of the relationship between the two people is somewhat different. I live in Western Siberia in the oil city of Tyumen, and there are a relatively high number of residents born in other cities, regions and even countries, amongst which there are many Ukranians. It was my taxi driver last night, however, who persuaded me to write this.\n\nWith grammatically awkward but perfectly understandable English he explained how he had moved from his home town of Mariupol by the Sea of Azov (between Crimea, Ukraine and Krasnodar Krai) only about 100km from Donetsk, and less than 50km from the border with Southern Russia. Mariupol has seen some of the worst battles in the crisis, with 29 people killed in a single long-range missile attack in January alone, and its strategic position as Donetsk’s nearest major sea port makes it vulnerable to future aggression. His wife and daughter had left their hometown with him only two months ago fearing for their safety, but the rest of his family had remained for a different fear – that of leaving their homeland in the first place. “I really wanted to live in America, but my English not good enough,” he explained to me. “There technology and clothes cheap, but salaries big. I work on vessel but not have good English, so I leave for Tyumen.”\n\nI wondered if he had felt any discomfort or unpleasantness due to his nationality. “No! No, here everything fine, only people say about poor life in Ukraine. No problem for me.” While the dialogue produced by western media focusses on the violent protests and military skirmishes, the fact remains that many Russians see a brotherhood with Ukranian people. I am not an experienced political reporter or analyst. I can only relay to you a view from inside Russia. The situation on the ground is beyond words – the unmarked militia, the burning buildings, the bloodshed, the violations of political processes. I am not here to gloss over the atrocities that have been committed; I am just simply not in a position to deal with them on this platform.\n\nA brief look down the list of names of my students at our English language school shows many “-shenko/-chenko” surnames – a traditional Ukranian name ending. When I broach the topic of the conflict with them, the ethnic Russians don’t begin a tubthumping jingoistic rant against their neighbours, nor do those with Ukranian heritage look around nervously expecting a backlash – simply because there isn’t one coming. Political discussion rarely produces a heated debate between the people I know here. When I carried out a quick survey a few weeks ago of all 50-odd students I currently teach to name one other politician other than President Vladimir Putin or Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, they couldn’t name one, including Nemtsov himself. Well, they did mention Zhirinovskiy, but while everyone knows him more for his populist extreme nationalist views and outlandish comments, not many seem to have much in-depth knowledge of his political history.\n\nA friend of my Russian wife told her about some neighbours of theirs who had bought a new flat. Being relatively successful in business, the husband had decided to give his flat on a ‘long-term loan’ to a family of Ukranians who had been forced to leave their home country, effectively helping them settle rent free. I later discovered that there are a number of websites and groups on ‘VKontakte’ (the Russian-language equivalent of Facebook) where Russians submit their unused clothes, buy supplies such as nappies, food and medicine and send donations to Ukranian families affected by the crisis.\n\nThis support is not indicative of the whole nation. There remain a number of stains on the national character and reputation, including many far-right groups who express abhorrently racist and homophobic views. It would be unfair to tar the whole population with this brush, however; Russian people are a highly-complex group who an intelligent sociologist could take decades studying and still not definitively map out their identity.\n\nIf I could leave you with one thought, let it be this: next time you read about the latest developments in Ukraine, just remember that for every armed separatist or corrupt politician, there is an honest, selfless and helpful citizen.\n\nWhile the world slaughters Vladimir Putin’s policies amid broken ceasefires in Ukraine and a currency that is still not showing signs of recovery, there is one side of Russia that is continually overlooked, or at least – in my humble opinion – misjudged: the people. I have written before about the overwhelming warmth I have felt from my new Siberian family and friends (check out Tyumen Musings Part Five), but seeing as today is Defenders of the Fatherland Day I thought it worth going further and unearthing what it is that makes me want to try and protect the reputation of the people.\n\nFirstly, it is important to accept that defining the Russian mentality and character is something Russians themselves are unable to do concisely. A student of mine contrasted the general differences between Russians and the English by describing his countrymen as coconuts and mine as peaches. “Hmm, I thought Russia was an abyss of frozen tundra, so what have coconuts got to do with the country?” I hear you say. Well, in short, Kostya explained that Russians are hard on the outside but soft on the inside; they want to appear to be tough, but some have a lack of gumption to back up their macho façade. Englishmen, he argued, are the opposite – all pleases and thank yous on the outside, but with determination and guts. I’m not sure how much I agree with the image, but it is telling that a Russian saw his own countrymen in this way.\n\nSecondly, it is hard to get definitive, unanimous and clear cut answers about the true meaning of this special day. Its roots are firmly in celebrating the contributions of the armed forces, although nowadays it has been opened up to effectively become ‘Men’s Day’. Even though most of my students have confirmed that the focus of the day is not so entrenched in recognising the military, I feel slightly uncomfortable being included in a day that I don’t directly contribute to. This is a country where conscription is alive and kicking (the mandatory period of service for men under the age of 27 was only recently reduced from two years to one), although being Russia, there is a plethora of creative excuses people seem to employ just to avoid having to spend twelve months digging holes in some remote Siberian backwater. A scratched back here, a bribe paid there, and hey presto, Sergey and Dmitry get to stay at home – although further education and medical ailments are legitimate. There is an odd rule that conscripts are posted far from their home town – and in Russia, that really is a long distance; think time zones, not bus rides.\n\nEach story that appears in the global press painting Russians as racist, bigoted and introverted sparks a pang of indignation inside me that I can’t control. The harsh truth is that there are sizeable segments of this society that blight the country with their morally abhorrent views, but certainly not a majority as the red top papers in particular would have you believe. This twinge I feel reminds me of how I felt at school sometimes. I was mercilessly bullied for nearly a decade by people who played on my sense of pride and individuality, and but for the support of my best friend George, one or two tutors and my family, I would have crumbled completely. Without question I developed a sharp sensitivity to injustice, or at least what I perceive to be thus, and I think this is the driving force behind my desire to open people’s eyes to the real Russia.\n\nMy wife’s father Vladimir is as fine a man as you will ever meet. He, like many, had lived through the breakup of the Soviet Union and the horrific financial crisis of 1998 (chickens then cost 6,000 roubles, which last summer would have worked out at £120) before the Russian economy collapsed last year. He brought up a young family with two children in a one room flat, but through hard work and astute preparation, ensured that his family never went without. I haven’t asked him about his military service, but for me it should not be relevant in the context of Defenders of the Fatherland Day: he defends the country by being progressive, thoughtful and kind, and I am lucky to have him as my father in law.\n\nI am aware that I have highlighted some serious problems that occur in Russia, so some may say that to suggest there is an injustice about the portrayal of the people of this country is inaccurate, but I can only describe my reactions. I am a strong believer in following your gut instinct, and my gut tells me that there is a gap in the worldwide understanding of my adopted homeland. I am hardly going to make waves from my personal blog here, but I sincerely hope that those of you who read this will take the effort to not condemn all Russians based on the limited image served up by newspapers – in the words of Benedict Cumberbatch’s Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate; “if you want the truth, you have to go and seek it out for yourself.” This is my contribution to Defenders of the Fatherland Day – my version of the truth about Russia.\n\nLast week, two strange things happenned to me. Firstly, Kate Garraway asked me live on ITV what pants I was wearing, and secondly, 1.5 million people watched as she said I “must be a man of class and demeanour.” Quite frankly, I’m still trying to work out which was more bizarre a week later. When a beautiful woman asks about what’s inside your trousers, you don’t expect to be sharing the moment with so many people, while co-presenter and fellow Strictly Come Dancing competitor Susanna Reid’s hysterics just added to the moment.\n\nPerhaps I should backtrack a little. On Tuesday evening in Tyumen I received a message from a producer at Good Morning Britain, the channel’s flagship breakfast show, asking if I would be interested in appearing live on the show the next morning to talk about surviving the weather in Siberia. Apparently back in England the temperature had dropped to -7° or -8°, and the media were labelling the weather system that had travelled all the way from my part of the world ‘The Beast from the East’, so they thought it’d be fun to get some perspective from over here.\n\nAfter a quick exchange of tweets, we spoke on Skype and emailed the final details of what was due to be discussed in the morning, and arranged to speak at about 5.30am UK time (the show started at 6am). A few adjustments to the camera angle and lighting later, I was all set to go, and listened as various clips of the live show were audible through my tablet as I munched on my cereal. My allotted time at 7.10 am UK time crept ever closer, but the odd thing was I couldn’t see what was going on in the studio, as the Skype connection was only one way.\n\nI had considered what I ought to wear, but settled on a suit and a clean shave (my wife and mother would have slaughtered me if I had not made myself look as presentable as possible, so an FC Tyumen football shirt was dismissed). For the record, my underwear was not thermal, as my interviewer enquired. It was all over in a flash, or at least it seemed that way, so I really didn’t have time to get nervous, and ended up thoroughly enjoying myself.\n\nLooking back, I still can’t believe it happened to me. I am still only 29, and I have begun to embrace the modern wonders of social media, but I have barely begun to conceptualize the sheer scale of its potential. Why did they pick me? Far-fetched as it may sound, I really am probably one of the few British people actively blogging from Siberia, so when they must have done a search for possible interviewee, I’m certain one of my diary entries about FC Tyumen came up – they’re entitled “Englishman in Siberia”. Imagine; if I had chosen a different title months ago, I’d never have had such an amazing opportunity.\n\nPerhaps I should take some perspective at this point: for all my wonder at the three minute segment on live TV I had, guess who today’s guest was? David Beckham. And back down to earth I come…\n\nAnyway, here is the video of my debut on live TV. If you want to find out more about life in Siberia, take a look at my other blog posts here, and if you enjoy it, tell anyone you think might be interested – the more the merrier!\n\nRC Adrenalin Tyumen v Perm\n\nAndrei Ostrikov is a full Russian international who has played professionally in three countries and has appeared at the World Cup. He has qualified for the Heineken Cup (sorry, I mean European Rugby Champions Cup…) with Sale, and at the age of 26 has time on his side to develop into a fearsome second row with a wealth of experience. But what would he have made of the Federal League Division Three Ural Region Championship Playoff Final between RC Adrenalin Tyumen and RC Perm in his home country?\n\nIt is difficult to be polite about the matchday experience of amateur Siberian rugby, and this is coming from a fan who has stood in the delapidated Jim Birtles stand at Heywood Road in the days when Sharky would steal the opposition’s water bottles and squirt them. Confidence was not inspired at the sight of the on-site ambulance driver having a fag in the back of the ‘swift medical help vehicle.’ To be fair, a reasonable attendance of around 300 had gathered to watch a sport that struggles for popularity way behind football, ice hockey, and biathlon, despite having been played in Russia since the nineteenth century. Venues dedicated to rugby are extremely rare out here, and the government-owned stadium that hosted Saturday’s crucial clash had been converted from a football pitch for the occasion. The full-size football goals had simply been extended upwards to make the posts far too wide and and short – think Eifion Lewis-Roberts, not Barrie Jon Mather. The ten-metre line and the 22 had been marked with white tape on the artificial surface that flapped about in the breeze. The five metre line had been omitted, however, and the opportunity to encroach at lineouts was gleefully abused, even if they didn’t seem to realise that they were transgressing the laws of the game.\n\nA firm grasp of the rules seemed beyond most people in the stadium – even the commentator had to be replaced by Tyumen’s substitute forward at half time. Both female line judges did a good job until a kick went out on the full and the referee had to explain to one of them why play had to be brought back 15 metres for the line out, but even he seemed to have a very generous interpretation of what a knock-on was. The atmosphere was curious: it felt like watching a cricket match in India as a huge roar went up for every single moment, whether relevant or not to the game. This probably wasn’t helped by the DJ playing Eye of the Tiger on loop, so first time fans had little help in distinguishing the genuinely tense moments from the irrelevant.\n\nLocal media had made an effort to cover the match, as a reporter from the local news channel interview fans on the front row during the first half, and photographers from Tyumenskaya Arena sports news agency captured the action as it unfolded. Forget TV replays, however useful they may have been – one huge boot landed in the upper reaches of the tall gantry with no cameramen there to return it.\n\nBut what of the game itself? Perhaps understandably, fluid passing moves were rare, and the concept of kicking for a reason seemed to be a step too far as both fly halves (the Russian translation literally means “wandering midfielder”) struggled to find touch from open play. Both sides preferred to employ a running game to kicking for territory, and the first four scores were all tries as the visitors took a 14-12 lead into half time. Both sets of backs lined up as flat in attack as in defence, which lead to a lot of handling errors as the midfield areas became very congested. However, despite the lack of shape, there were flashes of electric brilliance when gaps were found. The biggest cheer of the game came when Tyumen’s number 13, who had the build of a prop but was stationed on the wing (numbers seemed irrelevant for the most part), bulldozed his way past a couple of flimsy tackles and flattened a defender before finally being dragged to ground. It didn’t bode well for Perm as they had travelled nearly six hundred kilometres with only three substitutes, one of whom had his arm in a sling.\n\nThe score changed hands a number of times before the visitors opened up an eight point lead with quarter of an hour to go. At that point, the sky turned a violent shade of black and the heavens opened, which only made the error count climb higher and higher. A sensible penalty set up a grandstand finish, and Tyumen did not disappoint as a wonderful move through the backline ended with the ‘wandering midfielder’ squeezing over in the corner, before converting from the touchline to seal the win for the hosts. They thought it was the end of the match as they celebrated wildly, and were almost caught napping as Perm kicked off quickly, but despite a nervy final few moments, a delighted home crowd poured onto the pitch after the final whistle as players from both sides mingled with spectators in a relaxed impromptu photo session.\n\nRugby is developing rapidly in Russia as they face a crunch playoff against Uruguay for the last spot in England’s group for next year’s World Cup, and the physicality of the sport should appeal to native sports fans. The top flight is a fully professional league, and despite slapstick moments at the lower levels, the enthusiasm is there to potentially sustain the growth of the game.\n\nThis post is dedicated to Regina, Yulia, Nastya, Roman, Marina and Katya – the creators of Salt-Cucumber-Shashlyk…..\n\nRussia is not normal. Don’t get me wrong, I am in love with this fascinating country even with its many wondrous quirks, but it is not normal. I have lived here for almost five years, I am married to a Russian woman, even my two daughters are Russian, and yet I reckon I have scraped 0.1% of the surface of understanding what the essence of Russia is. I would like to share with you my observations, frustrations and experiences of living as a teacher, writer, father and Englishman in Siberia. This is not supposed to be an in-depth analysis of political, social or linguistic matters, merely my own personal take on life in this absorbing country – I hope you enjoy.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nWhat’s long, green and thick? No, it’s not the start of a rude joke, but the completely innocent and admirable attempt to describe a specially-prepared snack, usually eaten with vodka, by my teenage group of students two years ago. Cucumber is an ordinary word, but not one that pre-intermediate students always remember; instead of giving up and going straight to Google bloody Translate, the bane of my teaching life, they used their heads and found a way around the problem. I was so proud of them for their efforts, until I asked them what it was in Russian.\n\nTranslated literally, it is “salt cucumber”, or gherkin/pickle as we would say. The process of making them is lovingly crafted, using the large anonymous glass jars that babushki are so fond of out here to infuse vinegar, herbs and condiments into simple mini cucumbers. However, as my good friend Mike (who has Russian ancestry, has studied Russian for 17 years, speaks fluent Russian, has adopted the Russian Orthodox religion and has lived in Russia for over five years – but is from Liverpool…) observed, Russians have a strange habit of making the most delicious dishes appear unappetising to western palates.\n\nThe real reason the Russian word caused me consternation was the sound: соленые огурец. ‘Saloniy aguryets’ would be a rough transliteration using English letters, but its the last part of the first word, “ы”, that I detest. The nearest to a satisfactory description of the correct pronunciation I have heard is the sound you might make if punched rather forcefully in the stomach, but it is a nightmare to correctly use in speech. So naturally my teenagers took immense pleasure in teasing me about my inability to produce it, also asking me to say “шашлык” (‘shashlyk’), which is a simple pork or lamb kebab traditionally cooked on an open fire, and one of my favourite foods in Russia.\n\nEngaging these students in heated political debate was somewhat more challenging. In fact, very few locals have expressed even the slightest awareness, yet alone opinion, about key figures in Russia. I read Martin Sixsmith’s epic historical tome entitled “Russia” (well, I made it through to about 1923, then ran out of energy) and found a common theme between generations of not settling for second best – talk of needing an ‘iron fist’ to rule this vast nation tallied with a people who staged an entire revolution. And yet until recently, I have felt an antipathy towards politics confounded by the scale of mistrust in the honesty of people running this country. After the recent events in Crimea and Ukraine, however, there has been a surge in patriotism: as Commodus’ advisors say in Gladiator, “Rome is the mob”, and perhaps by giving people a stimulus for the debate on identity and nationality Vladimir Putin can distract them from the alarming devaluation of the rouble (at the time of writing 66 to the pound – three years ago it was closer to 50).\n\nI admit to becoming increasingly intrigued by politics here, in every sense of the word. One’s immediate reaction is that you can’t trust a Russian politician as far as you can throw one, and this is largely true with the system of backhanders and bribes that openly goes on. I will go into more detail on the global political landscape regarding this part of the world another time, suffice to say I feel obliged to pitch in on behalf of my adopted home. Mention “Russia” and “politician” to a British observer, and you will probably arouse images of the bad guys in a James Bond film, but that is to look at it from an outsider’s perspective – there is more to it than meets the eye.\n\nNext time I will explore the wonders of Shashlyk, the horrors of driving in Russia, and the bizarre weather – see you then."
