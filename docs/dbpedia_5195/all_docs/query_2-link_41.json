        "text": "– Well, my thing is Swedish curd cake, I live with it all the time. I bake about 1,000 curd cakes a week, so I breathe and live with it every day. As we speak, I am in Ljungby to hold a curd cakes baking course.\n\nBut it all really started in the 1600s in Småland, more specifically on a farm in Rödmossa. There, Ingegerd’s family has lived, baked, and of course eaten curd cakes, generation after generation.\n\n– Rödmossa means so much to me, and to my two children! That’s where my roots are and today I have a summer cottage located there. That place is also associated with curd cakes, as it was there that I allowed myself to experiment and come up with the best recipe. After many different variants, I got it right.\n\nIt’s clear that Ingegerd’s upbringing on a farm has shaped her way of living, and there’s no doubt about how important it is for her to continue preserving Swedish traditions. Ensuring high quality in both the ingredients for the curd cake and the materials for rainwear is something that seems obvious to Ingegerd.\n\n– I really appreciate when small businesses, just like Farmerrain, prioritize sustainability and create garments that last for decades. They design their own models and then produce them in northern Europe, which enhances their environmental thinking. Choosing natural, local, and sustainable ingredients for my curd cakes is therefore of the utmost priority for me.\n\n– Oh, in every way, I try to think sustainably! The whole basis of the pastry is about making use of all the leftover milk to make curd cake. Additionally, I buy large eggs with thin shells, which are difficult to sell in stores because they are so fragile, but for me, they are perfect. They are quick to crack, and they avoid being wasted. I buy milk from three local dairies, the sugar is, of course, Swedish, and all the curd cakes are completely gluten-free.\n\nIngegerd continues to tell passionately:\n\n– I must not forget to mention that I always use paper molds or buy my serving plates at flea markets. It just doesn’t feel worthy to serve curd cakes in an aluminum mold!\n\nIngegerd is not only good at making her curd cakes sustainable, but she has also confirmed that they are really delicious.\n\n– In the fall of 2023, I came second in Eldrimner’s competition, which focuses on small-scale businesses. It’s especially fun considering that I don’t use any additives at all, but it’s cornflour and pea flour. In the long term, the dream is to hopefully have Öland’s pea flour.\n\nIngegerd has known about Farmerrain as a company but had never owned a garment herself. So when Ingegerd won the retro coat, she was extra excited to finally feel how the garment would be in reality.\n\n– I have always been a fan of Farmerrain’s timeless design, their choice of colors is just brilliant, so when I was going to pick up my prize, I was quite convinced that I would like it.\n\nEven though our garments are primarily designed to be worn when it’s rainy, Ingegerd has chosen to use it for several different occasions, rain or not.\n\n– This coat is more than just a raincoat. I use it as my dress coat, and it’s perfect for strolling in the city or for a bike ride. Regardless rain or sun, I will use my Retro Coat!\n\nWhen Ingegerd finally was asked if she would recommend Farmerrain to others, it didn’t take more than a few seconds for her to respond.\n\n– Yes, absolutely! Their sustainable approach to clothing production, combined with their timeless design and genuine passion for the countryside, makes me a strong advocate for Farmerrain.\n\nCongratulations on winning the Retrokappa 2:0, and of course, for your silver medal in the Swedish Championships of Culinary Handicraft!\n\nFollow Ingegerd on → Instagram"
