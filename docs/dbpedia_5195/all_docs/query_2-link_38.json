        "text": "Since there isn´t any real suiting swedish forum for electric bicycles, I thought that I would present my ongoing build here instead, for the best support and knowledge, cause this is a goldmine of awesome builds and sweet caracters.\n\nMind you, I do not write in english every day, so spelling mishaps will occur.\n\nAfter completing a commuter build last year with a KTM bike, 16S LiFe 15Ah, 1000W hubmotor, and riding it to and from work last fall, I decided that I wanted something more powerful, and something able to climb rocks and trails in the nearby woods.\n\nI got my hands on a used Kona Stab Deluxe 2003(?) from the swedish equivalent to Craigs list.\n\nIt came with a Marzocchi Bomber Monster 03 front fork, and some Hayes Nine hydraulic disc brakes with 203mm discs.\n\nIt looked something like this (not my bike in the picture, but looks the same apart from the color of the rims).\n\nA short summary of the build is as follows:\n\nFrame: Kona stab deluxe\n\nTyres: Maxxis Hookworm 26\" 2\" wide\n\nMotor: Cromotor ver 2\n\nController: Lyen 24FET with some beefed up traces for 110-120Amps\n\nBatteries: Haiyen LiPos 20S4P = 74Vnom and 20Ah. They are hardcase 4S so the mounting should be very compact and tough\n\nBMS: Signalab 20S 30A (I will only run charging and the \"on\" voltage to the controller through the BMS so the 30A limit is not the limit of the system)\n\nCharger: Bulk charging with a 600W BMS-battery alloy charger. Might go ahead and buy a Mastech 100V 10A power supply later on\n\nA very nice feature on the Kona Stab is that the dropouts are removable, so I went ahead and drawn up some new dropouts with good clamping ability around the axle.\n\nI got some help with CNC machining from a friend, and it fits in the frame like a glove!\n\nIt also fits really snug around the axle. Almost no need to clamp it actually.\n\nI want the possibility for a powerful regen to save brakes, so I beefed up the rear swing arm with some 3mm stainless steel.\n\nAlso welded a 3mm piece of steel for the brake caliper.\n\nI had some problems with the chain on my new BMX freewheel, it would come of when power to the pedals was applied. I was convinced it had something to do with the Shimano chain tensioner that I had modified for the wider chain. So I machined out a new arm and a guide wheel.\n\nTurned out that the chain tensioner had nothing to do with my problem, and the real culprit was the cheap chineese freewheel that had very sharp edges on the teeth so the chain climbed. Some grinding later and it was smooth as a babys bottom.\n\nThis is more or less how it stands today. With some luck I´m getting the 20pcs of Lipo from Haiyen today. That would mean that I have the entire easter holiday to build a batterybox, somewhere on the bike\n\nThe controller is so large that I´m thinking of putting it on the luggage carrier on the back. You can see the cardboard mock up on the picture. The 24FET is a monster!\n\nThat sounds like serious fun\n\nI just asked Lyen if you could modify the controller somehow to handle more current, he said that for a couple of bucks he could solder up the traces, and ha claimed a 10-20% current increase.\n\nAs of now I dont think I will be pushing so many amps, maybe take it up in steps like 3kW, 4,5kW, 6kW and full power (8,5-9kW). I am in no way used to handle this much power between my legs :lol: so for my own sake I think I should just ramp it up slowly...\n\nAll cells are now measured. One cell was \"bad\" with 0,1V difference between the highest and lowest cell. I have to keep an eye on that one. The other ones had between 0,001 and 0,06V difference between cells. Seems like the \"Matched cells\"-sticker might really have something behind it besides sales argument.\n\nOf course I couldnt resist ducttaping some cells together on the frame. This is 10 of the 20 cells. I think I can squeeze the rest of the cells in the area of the triagle of the frame, if I can place the cells 3 in width as I have now...\n\nHow bid of a no-no is it to connect all the cells in series of 5 first, and then in parallell of 4?\n\nI know Drbass recommends his Makita 18650 to be joined in parallell first, and then series, but it is so much easier the other way around :wink:\n\nQwiksand said:\n\nVery nice work, love the detail you showed on the dropout mounts/reinforcement work. Will this be a primarily road-going vehicle or will it need to handle the dirt trails as well? If primarily road, I'd suggest you look at mounting your batteries in a fork mounted box- it would really clean up your build. If you need quick-turn maneuverability, however, this would not be an ideal solution.\n\nP.S. Your written/typed english is better than most of us \"native\" speakers\n\nThank you. And I think it will be something like 50/50 road and dirt trails. With the speed this thing will put out, I will probably get to work faster on this than taking the car\n\nMy first plan was actually to have the batteries in a box on the fork, I have even made drawings in the CAD and everything.\n\nBut when I saw how small the batteries are I changed my mind.\n\nIt will be much stelthier with the batteries in the frame then on the forks.\n\nI was able to duct tape all the batteries in the frame yesterday, and took it out for a test ride. Even with the batteries 140mm wide, and perhaps 20mm extra width for cables, I dont think I will rub my legs very much against the battery box...\n\nWorking on a cardboard template for the box. Unfortunatly I only have 200mm wide strips of aluminium, but I can get started on many pieces of the box before I need the side plates. I have a serious cold right now, but I think I can manage to drag myself to the workshop/garage on sunday and start cutting, bending and welding some aluminum.\n\nAs you can see the box is a bit higher in the front. Here I mean to have the CA, a main power breaker, and some sort of key for on/off to the controller. Nice and visible, and easy access to the main breaker if something goes wrong.\n\nDear Peter,\n\nI think also it is much better to parallel first and then in series.\n\nWith your 20pcs. 4S-5000mAh case packs is your setup:\n\n-5Ah x 4 pcs is 20Ah\n\n-and 5pcs from 4S is 20S\n\nThis is a lot of cabels and work. What charger do you prefer?\n\nDo you order the 20pcs. Haiyin hard case packs from the EU-Warehouse and how many postage costs do you pay?\n\nBest regards\n\necross\n\nMy wish to make serial packs first, and then parallel, is beacuse then I can use the existing bullet connectors on the batteries and just hook them up to each other. It will be done in five minutes or so.\n\nIf I need to parallell first, then I must cut the bullet connectors off, and solder them together into a larger gauge wire, and put a bigger bullet connector on. I am totaly okey doing this, if it means that the pack will perform better and/or live longer.\n\nHowever, me and a friend discussed this yesterday, and came to the conslusion that for example a 12S store bought battery, is essentially made with 3pcs of 4S cells in series.\n\nSay that I was going to run 12S 4P for example, then it would be the exact same thing to connect a string of 3pcs 4S in series, and then connect them in parallel, as it would be connecting the larger 12S batteries in parallel to start with, right?\n\nBut I do understand that there will be a risk of current flowing in the balance cables if a cell in one of the packs are lower then the equivalent cell in the other packs.\n\nI will connect the batteries in parallel first, but it is always nice to discuss and think about it a bit before doing something...\n\nMy plan is to bulk charge the battery with a BMS Alloy charger (as long as it holds), and then buy a Mastech power supply.\n\nI will have a BMS board connected to the pack all the time so it will hopefully stay nice and balanced.\n\nI ended up paying 50 Euros for the shipping from the European warehouse, I think the package was something like 12kg in weight. Delivery was made in a week and a half..."
