Encouraged by these seminars, I decided to research a project about Weimar cinema and philosophy in order to pursue an age-old question: the ontology of film. While contextualizing this question historically, I realized that a proper response to it could not be formulated without providing a sustained consideration of the human spectator, and positing a rigorous description on the relationship of the human to the cinematic technology. In this book, I have tried to show how this relationship may be understood both allegorically and philosophically, in order to draw attention to what I call an ethics of the cinema. My hope is that this allegory will resonate with the contemporary reader and illuminate ontological potentialities that belong to the moving image in general. I am thus eternally indebted to Kaja, for opening my mind to new adventures into capacious and ethical ways of thinking, and for disciplining my writing so that it remains hospitable to the other. I owe Tony my gratitude for providing me with unforgettable fragments of sage advice and for encouraging my interests in Weimar film and culture. I am grateful for Marty and his continued support of all my pursuits. I thank them for having commented upon preliminary versions of this project.

Walter Röhrig, 19201 The dominant sense is the mere desire to see, the naked curiosity, in particular if the experience is enacted with emotional emphasis: fear, terror, horror. The expressions of this basic disposition toward the objects are multiple (cinema). Martin Heidegger, The Phenomenology of Religious Life (1920)2 A man stands silently inside a box. His slender body is upright and stiff. A dim light illuminates his visage, intensifying its hard features and giving it a peculiar, ghostly pallor. Though the viewer is offered a close-up on his face, little emotion is revealed, as his eyes stay closed and his physiognomy remains expressionless. The light reflected from his face shines in stark contrast to an overturned bowl of dark, straight hair and an equally dark turtleneck sweater. The man’s mouth is slightly pursed and his unwrinkled countenance expresses the quiet repose of sleep or death. Either way, the unmoving figure provokes unease, fear, and impending horror. We are in the cinema, yet the cinema is at odds with itself, for we are looking at an ostensibly moving image of an immobile body. The silent, unmoving face announces Cesare (Conrad Veidt) the somnambulist’s first appearance in Robert Wiene’s well-known film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) (Figure 0.1). The pale whiteness of Cesare’s chalky skin may be likened to the surface of a film screen, whose function is to reflect the play of light and dark back to the spectator. Conrad Veidt’s makeup is garish and coarse, appearing like black charcoal streaks on the surface of a white canvas. Cesare is not introduced in the posed and charismatic manner of Zukor and Lasky’s Famous Players of the mid-teens. His motionless face, striking in its disquieting minimalism, appears\n\n2\n\nAfterlives\n\nFigure 0.1 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, 1920\n\nrather as a lifeless head on top of an embalmed body, like a still life, cosmetically treated for display. Has anyone yet failed to compare the cabinet of Dr. Caligari to a wooden coffin?3 Meanwhile, an ominous-looking showman in a tall top hat stands next to Cesare and gestures toward the stiff man. This eccentric carnival barker calls out to his attraction: “Cesare—Can you hear me? Cesare—I am calling you—I— Dr. Caligari—your master—Awaken for a moment from your dark night—” His lips mouth the words in the intertitle slowly and are accompanied by careful facial movements, escalating the uncanniness of the whole scene. Caligari’s physiognomy appears washed-out like that of a madman. Werner Krauss, the actor who plays the carnival barker, was a familiar presence in Max Reinhardt’s theater before coming to the cinema. A quick cut to his portly body shows us what he has carried over to the new medium: extreme gestures characteristic of the Expressionist acting style, and erratic corporeal rhythms that alternate between jerky nervousness and a much more measured, almost obsessive deliberation. In The Visible Man, published in 1924, film theorist Béla Balázs asserts that the cinematic medium expresses a fundamentally wordless language made up of bodily and facial gestures: “It is film that will have the ability to raise up and make visible once more human beings who are now buried under mountains of words and concepts.”4 In the age of cinema, the expressive body becomes visible once again. It speaks through the nonverbal language of gesture, exploiting the specific capacities of the moving image, while casting off the disembodying, metaphysical abstractions fabricated by the written word. Though the spectator\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ndoes not hear Krauss’s voice as he motions toward the silent somnambulist, his animated corporeality nevertheless bespeaks a psychologically unstable, possibly perverse inner soul. In response to Caligari’s call to awaken, the film cuts back to Cesare’s face. In the close-up, we see wrinkles form in the forehead and around his barely quivering nose. Cesare’s painted eyebrows tighten in consternation while his sharp nostrils subtly widen. His delicate mouth opens slightly as if to take in oxygen for the first time. Meanwhile, the somnambulist’s eyelids begin to flutter like the wings of an emergent moth, taking time to become accustomed to the light. When Cesare’s eyes finally open, revealing deeply set eyeballs, the effect is hair-raising. His spheres for seeing strike white against thick, dark eyeliner, and unsettlingly gaze directly back at the viewer, addressing her directly. The “dead” man has awakened, and he has awakened us (Figure 0.2). Something grotesque seems to be taking place here as Cesare opens his nose, mouth, and eyes, and as the inside of his head is exposed to the viewer. The man’s strange transformation from stillness to movement and his returned gaze chillingly recall Rainer Maria Rilke’s 1908 poem, “The Archaic Torso of Apollo.” The poet describes the statue of the Greek god coming to life and addressing the viewer with the directive: Du mußt dein Leben ändern (“You must change your life”).5 It echoes the mysterious tagline featured on posters for Caligari that for months preceded its premiere: Du mußt Caligari werden (“You must become Caligari”). The scene turns increasingly bizarre and fantastic. Cesare’s eyelids widen further into circular rings, opening like a strange flower eager to take in the light\n\nFigure 0.2 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, 1920\n\n4\n\nAfterlives\n\nthat will sustain its life. His eyeballs seem to gain an agency of their own, as if to strain against the face that confines them. Cesare’s physiognomy expresses a kind of wondrous fascination in the fact that seeing is possible at all, eliciting both astonishment and horror in the miracle of his own resurrection. As the eyelids close and open, his charcoal eyebrows rise in unison, hypnotizing the viewer with their eerie rhythm.6 It is as if Cesare’s gaze were to reach out from the screen, to close the distance between looker and looked-at so that he can touch the seated spectator with his eyes. The experience of discomfort and the fear of physical contact remind the viewer that the ostensibly disembodied eyeball is in fact always already embodied, and that the phenomenon of vision cannot take place without the corpus that enables it. This well-known scene from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari returns the spectator to an experience that has remained repressed in the history of cinema. Its carnival settings explicitly recall the fairground attractions where short, non-narrative films and actualities were often exhibited.7 Brought face-to-face with Cesare’s awakening, one is returned to the wonder of seeing “living pictures” becoming animated and to the astonishing experience of the Lumière brothers’ handcranked cinematograph projections stirred to life: Cesare’s still visage is stirred to movement, recalling the dismal life featured in the Kingdom of Shadows.8 In an article roughly contemporaneous with Wiene’s film, published in March 1922, Arnold Zweig writes that “The attraction [‘Reiz’] that radiates from objects in film is constituted by seeing something inanimate become animate. Film is wholly based upon the free development of the living.”9 Zweig goes on to identify this “attraction,” cinema’s capacity to infuse inert objects with life, as one of the “theoretical foundations of film.” Cesare embodies and self-reflexively allegorizes cinema’s unique capacity to animate motionless objects and awaken slumbering bodies precisely in this regard.10 Describing the phenomenology of “film’s body,” theorist Vivian Sobchack writes that cinema “functions to visibly animate perception and expression in existence.”11 Upright, like the vertically positioned film screen, the stiff somnambulist manifests what Gilles Deleuze calls a “spiritual automaton,” evolving toward an autonomous cinema that realizes the image of “the way thought thinks and itself thinks itself.”12 In this, Cesare stands as an originary model for all the artificial forms of life represented in film history, forms that aspire to the condition of thought and self-reflexivity. Animation is a repeated trope in the German films of this period. One may be reminded of the mummy’s awakening in Ernst Lubitsch’s Eyes of the Mummy Ma (1918) or the mechanical automaton in his comedic film, The Doll (1919). In\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nJoe May’s The Indian Tomb (1921), a dead yogi is resurrected to serve an Indian prince. Upon awakening, the revived mystic slowly turns his weary head and says solemnly, “Prince, you have restored me to life. The holy commandments direct me to submit myself to your wishes.” Reiterating the close-up on Cesare’s awakening face, Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927) also features a close-up on the face of the robot Maria as she is brought to animate life by the engineer Rotwang.13 F. W. Murnau’s vampire in Nosferatu (1922) has been interpreted as an allegory of the film image: its undead body manifests the resurrection of the dead past to the lived present.14 Paul Leni’s wax figures are animated in Waxworks (1924), and the hands of the dead criminal in Wiene’s The Hands of Orlac (1924), also starring Veidt, exploit the chiasmatic relationship between the living and the mechanical, expressed through the animative powers of the cinema. Other examples include Lilith and Ly (1919), about a statue coming to life, and Murnau’s early work Januskopf (1920), based on the story of Dr. Jekyll and his uncanny double Mr. Hyde.15 One might even point to the strange, geometrically shaped organisms that come into being and recede into the background in Hans Richter’s abstract film Rhythmus 21, or the abstract figures that flit and play in Walter Ruttmann’s Opus films between 1921 and 1925. When Zweig invokes life and the “free development of the living” in his 1922 article, he taps into a wider discourse for addressing the specificity of film. This discourse circulated not only in Weimar Germany, but internationally as well. As a rejoinder to the high modernisms emerging in the fields of art, architecture, music, and poetry, each emphasizing qualities specific to their respective mediums, the discourses of dynamism, movement, and life were utilized to isolate a cinéma pur that would allow film to transcend its nature as a commodity for the masses and emerge as a sister art. A screening of Golden and Porter’s The Count of Monte Cristo (1913) compelled writer Erwin Magnus to assert the artistic legitimacy of film and to declare, “Never has the expression ‘living pictures’ become so clear for me,” in a book titled Lichtspiel und Leben (1924).16 Jean Epstein, writing in 1923, celebrates a critical category borrowed from Louis Delluc: photogénie, the purest expression of cinematic life. Epstein stipulates that “only mobile aspects of the world, of things and souls, may see their moral value increased by filmic reproduction,” thus privileging the ontology of animate beings over the inanimate.17 The voices of Zweig, Magnus, and Epstein were part of a chorus of international thinkers and artists that privileged the vital potentialities of the film image. Bernhard Diebold, Germaine Dulac, Fernand Léger, René Clair, Dziga Vertov, and the Japanese Pure Film Movement\n\n6\n\nAfterlives\n\nunderscored cinema’s unique formal properties and its exclusive link with living motion in order to legitimate its artistic value. When Balázs criticizes the disembodied constructs of words and concepts in The Visible Man, he also legitimizes the cinema by underscoring how film can present the “living physiognomy that all things possess” (emphasis in the original).18 Through the cinema and the close-up, we can observe not the “onceand-for-all rigid physiognomy, but a mysterious play of expressions” that is a key characteristic of all filmed objects.19 It is precisely this enigmatic, living play of expressions, each one evolving and transforming into the next, that is showcased in the sequence of Cesare’s awakening. “In Caligari,” Balázs writes, “the object world’s demonic play of features was so pronounced that it lost the naturalness that attaches to lifeless objects, and acquired instead the living naturalness of the human sphere.”20 For millennia, poets and thinkers have pondered the mysterious, vital essence that animates the cosmos, including the fish, birds, and mammals of the earth.21 This essential and enduringly mysterious life force could now be explored through the cinematic technology. Theorizing the transformation from lifeless object to living naturalness will be my main concern in this book. The language of cinematic life, utilized offhandedly at times by Balázs, Epstein, and others, calls out for historical contextualization and greater theoretical rigor. By elaborating on such articulations of “life” in early Weimar film culture, this book will explore a number of their key aesthetic, political, and ethical stakes in order to elucidate an ontology of the film medium. My vocabulary for theorizing its evanescent ontology will be drawn from philosophical and literary texts that appeared at the same time Weimar cinema began to self-reflexively frame the notion of life as specific to the art of film. Through the following historico-philosophical analysis, we shall see how and why the cinema remains the most important medium for thinking life in modernity. Balázs’s observations on the animation of Cesare’s physiognomy, considered in light of Henri Bergson’s description of the ontology of mobile objects, exemplify how the vocabulary of cinematic life may be understood both historically and philosophically. Between 1911 and 1912, Balázs had personal contact with the French philosopher during a stay in Paris.22 In his Spirit of Film from 1930, Balázs explicitly compares Bergson’s description of a melody with the play of facial expressions in the cinema, indicating that the former was intimately familiar with the latter’s ideas on the phenomenon of transformation and understood them in cinematic terms.23 Both were clearly interested in the problem of change\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nand duration, and their theoretical affinity is bolstered by their shared historical contemporaneity. If it could be said that the investigation of duration undergirds Bergson’s philosophy in general,24 this pursuit is perhaps most forcefully articulated in his 1903 essay, “Introduction to Metaphysics.”25 Bergson makes constant reference to an ancient, metaphysical problem, the description of a moving object in space, in order to probe the nature of change as it appears to the human observer. According to him, there are two basic attitudes that may be taken in relation to a moving object: analysis and intuition. Analysis takes a disinterested, mechanistic view of the object, resolving its change of place into a series of immobile points in space. As the eye observes its movement in time, the analytical mind overlays onto this phenomenon a series of quantifiable points through which the object has moved. “What the immobile points are to the movement of a mobile,” Bergson writes, “so are the concepts of various qualities to the qualitative change of an object.”26 When representing this movement to herself, the observer reconstitutes the object’s original movement through a series of immobile points, as a procession of snapshots that represent its passing from point A to B. Bergson calls this consciousness the “cinematographic mechanism of thought” in his Creative Evolution from 1907. As we know, he will condemn the cinematograph for reproducing the “mechanistic illusion” of analysis.27 In “Introduction to Metaphysics,” Bergson bypasses the epistemological limitations of the analytical attitude by appealing to another: intuition. Intuition stands in direct contrast to the disinterested cogitation of the analytical attitude. It is highly interested, and is “the sympathy by which one is transported into the interior of an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently inexpressible in it.”28 Intuition lives with the movement of a mobile object in time, not by objectively observing it from without, but by understanding the object “from within.”29 Likewise, as Cesare’s face transforms from a sleeping to an awakened state, this change from A to B is experienced by the living viewer as a continuous transformation constituted through the moving image. The transformation takes place like an unfolding melody, as Balázs suggests in his chapter “The Play of Facial Expressions” from The Visible Man: “In the legato of visual continuity, past and future expressions merge into one another and display not just the individual states of the soul but also the mysterious process of development itself.”30 What matters for Balázs are not the individualized, in-between states of the awakening face but the flowing legato of its stirring and expressivity, its embodiment of the “living naturalness of the\n\n8\n\nAfterlives\n\nhuman sphere.” Only the intuitive attitude, as described by Bergson, one that “sympathizes” with Cesare’s vital impetus and his mysterious awakening, can do justice to the metaphysics of change. This study of Weimar film will work with the tension between what Bergson calls the analytic and intuitive attitudes toward change in order to seek a philosophical language adequate to describing the human experience of cinematic duration. This language will be rooted in how critics, theorists, and other thinkers posited “life” as somehow key to the experience of time. While most studies of Weimar film have approached films like Caligari to make analytical insights about its aesthetics or the cultural history surrounding it, this book attempts to describe cinematic change, allegorized through highly selfreflexive moments such as in Cesare’s awakening, “from within.” Bergson directs the living observer to look inward when describing the image of change, for she already embodies the same continuity of flow expressed by the image of transformation in time. If Cesare’s awakening may be read, as many have argued, as self-reflexive of the life of the film medium, the following analyses of his astonishing arousal and other key moments from the films of the early Weimar period aim to facilitate an “intuitive” understanding of the ontology of cinema. As we shall see, sympathy with the film image will yield profound political and ethical ramifications.\n\nII Therefore, if philosophy is in harmony with the cinema, if thought and technical effort are heading in the same direction, it is because the philosopher and the moviemaker share a certain way of being, a certain view of the world which belongs to a generation. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, “The Film and the New Psychology” (1945)31 Afterlives derives an ontology of the cinema by closely reading the films and philosophy conceived during the early Weimar period. While the philosophical texts I will discuss in this book do not reference the cinema explicitly, I will draw out theoretical parallels and allegorical correspondences between them: both utilized the category of “life” to describe the transient, the fleeting, and the contingent. Martin Heidegger’s early seminars on Aristotle, Ernst Bloch’s utopian philosophy, Georg Simmel’s vitalist sociology, Siegfried Kracauer’s redemptive\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nWeimar writings, psychoanalytic texts by Sigmund Freud and Karl Abraham, Walter Benjamin’s theory of allegory, Rainer Maria Rilke’s postwar poems and correspondence, Max Scheler’s philosophical anthropology, and Martin Buber’s ethical writing all utilized the concept of “life” at the same time that writers like Zweig and Epstein were developing this concept to describe the “essence” of film. Accordingly, the films I analyze in this book aspire to philosophy, not by depicting philosophical concepts, but by enacting them through the powers of cinema. By placing texts and contexts, films and philosophy, in juxtaposition, this work bears out Merleau-Ponty’s assertion that filmmakers and philosophers “share a certain way of being, a certain view of the world which belongs to a generation.” More specifically, the forms of thinking and structures of feeling I trace across the films, philosophy, and cultural history of the early Weimar period elaborate what film scholar Sabine Hake calls “fictions of cinema.”32 In Cinema’s Third Machine, Hake deftly traces the vast complexity and diversity of Weimar film criticism, revealing how discourse about the cinema legitimated the new medium as an object of ontological inquiry. In Afterlives, I pursue a singular path through the diversity of Weimar film history by focusing on notions of “life” that appear in this historical literature. When observers of the time compared the film medium to life, this comparison was not merely metaphorical, but functioned as a shorthand for invoking philosophical notions of change and time. These notions belong to a generation of writers and filmmakers who lived in a particular historical time and place, and yet, as we shall see, this contextualized understanding has much to contribute to our philosophical thinking about the moving image today. The films covered in this book emerged at a watershed moment in modern human history. The defeat of the Great War brought ruin to German civilization, and the misery that followed reiterated the impermanence of all things in the world. The experience of war trauma and the humiliation of defeat affected all areas of public and private life in the Weimar Republic. Linear notions of time and history lost their power to consolidate ideological consensus between those on the home front who were shocked by the outcome of the war and those who returned from the war front shell shocked.33 Old forms and institutions lost their legitimacy, while traditional, idealized ways of knowing lost their relevance to explain the modern world. In their attempts to deal with the misery of the present, many expressed profound nostalgia for a prewar past, while others dreamt of an unrealizable, utopian future. Visions of a different world, of other times and other places, proliferated in literature, theater, architecture, and the\n\n10\n\nAfterlives\n\ncinema—anything to escape the overwhelming grief associated with the war. Yet despite not showing realistic scenes of infantrymen in trenches or soldiers manning machine guns, the fantastic films of the early Weimar years, set in alternative worlds and historical times, are nevertheless deeply informed by this “culture of defeat.”34 While death and trauma are topics that have concerned generations of artists and writers throughout history, the generation that survived the Great War understood these topics as inextricably linked to the epistemological upheavals of modernity. In his essay, “The Storyteller,” Benjamin calls attention to traumatized war veterans, who returned not richer, but poorer in their ability to communicate their experiences on the battlefield. “A generation,” he writes, “that had gone to school on a horse-drawn streetcar now stood under the open sky in a countryside in which nothing remained unchanged but the clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body.”35 Many of the writers and filmmakers whose work I analyze in fact participated directly in military activities. Rilke was drafted to the Austrian Landsturm and later discharged for health reasons. Fritz Lang was a reconnaissance infantryman, decorated with honors. F. W. Murnau was a combat pilot for the Luftwaffe. Scheler, devoted to Germany’s war cause, was also drafted but later discharged from the front and placed in various diplomatic positions for the German Foreign Office. Freud’s three sons and son-in-law fought on both Western and Eastern fronts. Indeed, many of the filmmakers and thinkers whose work I will interpret fought for the Fatherland between 1914 and 1918. All lost loved ones or knew of someone who lost a loved one during wartime. Afterlives thus treats postwar cinematic and philosophical work as texts working through the ethics of survival. These texts were produced by individuals who outlived friends and family, carrying the memory of loss throughout their lives. The postwar context informs my insistence upon mortality and its connection to discourses that address the “living pictures” of the cinema. Recent books on film after the Great War have tended to generalize about the cinematic representation of trauma. Both Cinema and the Great War (2011), by Andrew Kelly, and Der Erste Weltkrieg im Film (2009), edited by Rainer Rother and Karin Herbst-Meßlinger, explore the relationship between war and film from an international perspective, examining films from many of the nations that sent soldiers to fight. This book will focus on the Weimar German context and the experience of loss that was central to everyday life after the war. My focus on early Weimar Germany will reveal that its culture of defeat enabled a\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nspecific interpretation of time and temporality, which has relevance, not only for the broad understanding of postwar trauma, but also for general questions of film-philosophy. One of the main goals of this book will be to show how a specific historical and cultural context grounds metaphysical inquiry, and that this inquiry is already a form of cinematic thinking. Throughout we shall reflect upon the ontology of the image as a model for theorizing human experience and for framing questions of temporality. It has been noted that the photographic image documents an irretrievable past, making it an appropriate medium for meditation upon loss. Film theorist André Bazin associates the photographic image with mummification, calling the photographic process “the preservation of life by a representation of life.”36 Accordingly cinema, in its representation of worldly objects, gives us “the image of their duration, changed mummified as it were.”37 Past events are extended into the present, doubled through their reanimation, and rendered capable of being replayed. Accordingly, through the image of preserved life, particularly of life that has passed away, films from the early Weimar period may be read as “sites of memory” that negotiate the status of the dead for the living—ghostly afterlives that enable reflection upon loss, temporality, and the ontology of the moving image for those who survived.38 The experience of loss and the realization of one’s own mortality, we shall see, are inextricably bound up with what I am calling the ontological “afterlife” of the moving image. The films I treat as sites of memory include both popular and art films: Nerves (1920), The Haunted Castle (1921), Phantom (1922), Destiny (1921), The Golem: How He Came Into the World (1920), The Nibelungen (1924), and Warning Shadows (1923). A number of recent studies have brought genre and popular films into the scope of Weimar film studies. The essays collected in The Many Faces of Weimar Cinema (2010), edited by Christian Rogowski, attempt to counterbalance the tendency in German film studies to privilege the artistic masterpieces of Weimar film history. A recent example of this tendency is Weimar Cinema: An Essential Guide to Classic Films of the Era (2009), edited by Noah Isenberg. Perhaps more relevant to the present study, Philip Stiasny’s Das Kino und der Krieg (2009) explains how many popular films in this period inherited wartime genre conventions while working through the traumas of war. My choice of films reflects not only how the culture of defeat affected all types of filmmaking, both popular and those we think of today as classics of the era, but also how an analytical focus on questions of life and mortality casts light on overlooked films that have not been canonized as masterpieces.\n\n12\n\nAfterlives\n\nWhile this book will move between close readings of films and philosophical writings contemporaneous to them, my intention is not to analyze The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as a vitalist film, nor do I see Lang’s Destiny as simply illustrating Heidegger’s philosophy. I do not intend to read film through the “lens” of theory. Taking both as forms of thinking, I instead move more fluidly between philosophy and film, highlighting affinities between the two.39 Anton Kaes, in Shell Shock Cinema: Weimar Cinema and the Wounds of War (2011), masterfully reads films and their intellectual contexts alongside each other—both are informed by and respond to the experience of war trauma. Through his book, one comes to understand films such as Nosferatu and Metropolis, not simply as waypoints on the teleological path toward inevitable doom, but as embedded in a culture dominated by melancholic loss. One also comes to a greater understanding of the cinema in general through his analysis, as Kaes’s historiography passes over, at key moments, into film theorizing. Thomas Elsaesser’s Weimar Cinema and After: Germany’s Historical Imaginary (2000) revolves around the question of what it is about “this cinema that allowed such a ‘fit’ between film and history to remain convincing for so long?”40 Like Elsaesser, I believe that an answer may be gleaned through the films’ highly self-reflexive aims and their utilization of mise-en-abîme framing devices. Thinking their own ontology, Weimar cinema reflects upon film as an experience that persists in time, staging not only its particular aesthetics, but also the viewer’s lived duration before the moving image. Recent scholarship has too often understood the ontological claims made by Weimar writers about the essence of film as “naïve” philosophizing. The aesthetic purity of film and the question of its medium specificity have lost their urgency in our postmodern era, so it is said, and what remains for Weimar film scholarship is to frame these ideological concerns culturally, as reflecting economic or institutional configurations. However, we will see how such claims can be read as both historical and philosophical, and in so doing see that ontological thinking about the cinema means facilitating the conditions necessary for the cinema to self-reflexively think its own conditions of possibility. My choice of texts reflects the belief that the philosophy of film not only cannot be separated from historical concerns, surrounding both the texts’ conception and reception, but also the specific, present-day interest of the historian writing about them. We will see how Weimar cinema and culture seemed to anticipate the contingencies of their futural interpretation, and the film historiographies to come, by rethinking philosophemes of history to make them more appropriate\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nto the enduring challenges of modernity. Siegfried Kracauer already had some inkling of the profound implications of the reproducible image for the aims of historiography in his 1927 essay, “Photography.” There he writes that the turn to photography is the “go-for-broke game of history,” in that the use of mechanically produced images for historiography compels a decisive moment for those who write about the past.41 Photography challenges the historian to find a new, provisional order to the fragments of history jumbled by the modern episteme, and to “awaken an inkling of the right order of the inventory of nature.”42 Notably, Kracauer explains that “the capacity to stir up the elements of nature is one of the possibilities of film,”43 referring to the histories opened up through the “strange constructs”44 assembled through montage. In playing this game of go-for-broke, the Weimar critic points to the decisive transformations in theories of history concomitant with the modern era. Historiography’s aim is not simply to narrate a linear series of past events from A to B, but rather to piece together strange constructs that are akin to cinematic montage. These constructs illuminate films, philosophy, and other materials of the time through their juxtaposition, while drawing out key allegorical affinities between them. To be clear: In Afterlives, I do not simply show how films illustrate philosophical concepts. My aim is to reveal how the films aspire to the condition of philosophy, showing how they think through problems of ontology and duration. This ontology is derived from an intense engagement with the historical context of Weimar Germany after World War I, and revolves around questions of mortality, absence, and ephemerality, questions that are deeply informed by the experience of loss. My “strange construct” of Weimar film history puts forth two broad claims, which I will summarize below.45 First, the central premise of this book concerns the intertwined roles of life and death in relation to cinema and the postwar viewer’s experience of it. Beginning with the astonishment in seeing the inert, “dead” image come to life, Afterlives argues that the vital, moving image is at every moment haunted by its original, inanimate condition. Seen within the context of postwar Weimar culture, the cinema image itself may be thought of as an afterlife that allegorically resurrects and represents the lives of those who can no longer represent themselves. And yet, while film allegorically reanimates the dead, this resurrected life remains ghostly, uncanny, never separating itself fully from its previously lifeless condition. Film theorist Laura Mulvey, in Death 24x a Second, similarly links the existential problem of life and death to the theorization of the moving image:\n\n14\n\nAfterlives For human and all organic life, time marks the movement along a path to death, that is, to the stillness that represents the transformation of the animate into the inanimate. In cinema, the blending of movement and stillness touches on this point of uncertainty so that, buried in the cinema’s materiality, lies a reminder of the difficulty of understanding passing time and, ultimately, of understanding death.46\n\nAs we shall see, philosophy proposes that life is not opposed to death, but both stand as equal partners throughout the duration of worldly existence. Correspondingly, the moving image emerges from inanimacy, becomes resurrected as technological, animate life, and drives toward its end, aiming to return to an inanimate state. Cesare not only allegorizes the animation of the inanimate, but also the return to stillness after Caligari has concluded, signaled by the black leader that concludes its last reel and, more literally, by the shutting off of the film projector. “Life” and “death” do not simply function as metaphors in this book, but serve as pivot points between film discourse and philosophical discourse, mobilized toward the aim of describing the transience of film. For a generation who found it difficult to directly confront the fact of death, the cinema of this period draws attention to the capacity of film, again selfreflexively, to bring the spectator to affirm and perhaps even sympathize with her own possible death. It has been argued that film is particularly suited to enable the spectator’s confrontation with horrors that cannot be confronted directly in reality. In his Theory of Film, Kracauer, invoking Greek mythology, compared the film screen with Athena’s polished shield, whose reflection enables the spectator to behold “happenings which would petrify us were we to encounter them in real life.”47 Coming face-to-face with Medusa, Perseus was able to confront the horror of her monstrous countenance and avoid being turned to stone through the mediation of his shield. Without the mediation of film, the existential dread of mortality, and the inevitability of becoming inert material, would overwhelm the spectator, for “we do not, and cannot, see actual horrors because they paralyze us with blinding fear.”48 The cinema, for Kracauer, offers the spectator the opportunity to confront the dread of that which must be disavowed in the flow of everyday life: the possibility of one’s own nothingness. This disavowal is inextricably linked to the metaphysics of instrumental reason in modernity as well as to the aporias of philosophical language, as we shall see. Lang subtitled the first part of his Mabuse series from 1922, “Ein Bild der Zeit,” (“A Picture of the Times”). The postwar films discussed throughout this\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nbook are reflections of their time that make visible, like Athena’s shield, the horror of the transience of all things, an existential fact reiterated by the trauma of war. Correspondingly, my interpretations of early Weimar films foreground their capacity to function as momenta mori, reminding the viewer of her own finitude. This book explores how Weimar cinema imputes a film spectator that is not simply an imaginary, idealized construct, narcissistic in her demand for narrative continuity and transcendental wholeness, but an empirical, mortal human being existing in time. As Bergson puts it in his “Introduction to Metaphysics,” “It is, if you like, the unrolling of a spool, for there is no living being who does not feel himself coming little by little to the end of his span; and living consists in growing old.”49 This experience of time passing is precisely what enables reflection on cinematic time, beyond the vulgar, mechanical understanding of time measured by the clock.50 Through a close reading of the films I have chosen, the experience of loss is reflected, not only as time passing, but also as passing toward death. My second claim emerges out of this and addresses the ethics of the relationship between the human spectator and the cinematic technology. If figures demonstrating the animation of the inanimate, like Cesare, allegorize the moving image, they also allegorize the spectator’s relationship to it. In this book, I consider how early Weimar films encourage human spectators to see their ontological correlative in the technological cinema. Philosopher Bernard Stiegler writes of this co-relation, noting that “between the inorganic beings of the physical sciences and the organized beings of biology, there does exist a third genre of ‘being’: ‘inorganic organized beings,’ or technical objects.”51 This third genre of being, while it does not evince the dynamic qualities typically associated with organic life, cannot be separated from questions of temporality that constitute and underpin human Dasein. For Stiegler, technics is “the pursuit of life by means other than life,” meaning that technics exteriorizes fundamental problems of temporality, retention and protention, that structure questions of ontology.52 In these ways the cinema is the technical object par excellence in that it models the lived experience of duration through technical means. Later Stiegler describes the relationship between the human viewer and the cinema as an interweaving flow: My time is always that of others. Cinema reveals this cinemato-graphically. Stream of consciousness is the contraction of time, whose initiation process occurs in a cinema in which my time, within the film’s time, becomes the time of an other and an other time.53\n\n16\n\nAfterlives\n\nIn Afterlives, I read the allegories of cinematic life as technical objects that not only put into motion basic questions of temporality, that is questions of memory and futural anticipation, but also function as uncanny doubles of human life as it evolves through the continuity of the present. In this sense, the cinema teaches its spectators the futural possibility of death because its own ontology may be characterized as being-toward-death. Through this awareness, the cinema ordains the human viewer to take responsibility for the flourishing of the precarious, technological other. Spectators thus have something to say about life in relation to the moving image because they themselves are considered alive. In 1926, Curt Morek noted that “The life depicted by film is our own existence [Dasein],” and that in the cinema “we watch ourselves live.”54 This life is precisely what makes possible the “sympathy” of the human observer with a moving object, described by Bergson in his essay from 1903. In The Visible Man, Balázs argues that the cinema shows us how to see the expressive faces in the objects and settings of everyday life— tables, cupboards, sofas, the face of a friend or enemy in a landscape. This is not delusion, nor is it narcissistic anthropomorphization. The capacity to see the physiognomy of things appeals to what Balázs calls “the indescribable attraction of anonymously living the life of an other, a Doppelgänger.” Notably, Balázs is careful to maintain a separation between the spectator and her double: “It is an opportunity for the deepest psychological insight: how to be someone else and still be myself?”55 Recognition of the face of things enables an ethics of the faceto-face encounter between human and cinematic life, an encounter that brings the self in relation to the other while soliciting a dimension of exteriority, “to be someone else and still be myself,” beyond the epistemological confines of the Cartesian ego.56 Thus early Weimar films are not simply vehicles for escapist horror. Central to the formation of a “vernacular modernism,” cinema produces a sensorium that teaches viewers the ethical and political dimensions of living and dying within our mass-mediated context.57 And as a technical object, the cinema is not a living organism, yet it nevertheless raises questions of how humans may learn to more ethically coexist with their nonhuman, and human, others. Bypassing the imputation of a captivated viewer, seamlessly sutured to the cinematic apparatus, we shall see how Weimar cinema interrupts this interlock between spectator and screen, precisely in order to raise philosophical questions around the relationship of living viewers to the cinematic technology. This interpretation is inseparable from the temporality of the moving image, and inextricably\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nlinked to the manner in which the cinema figures the openness of the future temporality. A heightened sensitivity to the durational ontology of the moving image, “the time of an other and an other time” synchronous with the spectator’s own life, can enable new relations with the cinema, beyond those predetermined by the dialectic of the subject and apparatus. Afterlives will craft these two arguments cumulatively through five chapters. Chapters 1 to 3 will address the postwar survivor’s apprehension of death (argument one), and Chapters 4 and 5 will build from this in order to elucidate the ethics in relation to the cinema technology (argument two). In Chapter 1, I will look at Robert Reinert’s Nerves and delineate two masculine reactionformations: one characterized by paranoid delusion and the other by postwar recuperation. Drawing from writings by Freud, Abraham, and many others, I show how these masculinities illuminate an etiology of the postwar film spectator, as well as a corresponding ontology of the film medium. Chapter 2 continues this psycho-philosophical analysis and addresses the historicity of trauma in two films by F. W. Murnau, The Haunted Castle and Phantom. In contrast to the narcissistic subject who cannot abide the radical otherness of death, I privilege the role of the melancholic spectator, explicated through writings by Benjamin and Bergson, who has interiorized the absent other and who understands this introjection in a spectral, fantasmatic form. In Chapter 3, I further elucidate the temporality of the film image by analyzing how the three episodes in Lang’s film, Destiny, narratively play out the cycle of life, love, and death. Making reference to work by Heidegger and Rilke, I show how all three take place in a single moment, collapsing the past, present, and future temporalities in the blink of an eye. Chapter 4 moves from the death of the temporalized human being, which remains inaccessible to metaphysics, to the death of the living other by performing a close analysis of some key scenes from Paul Wegener’s Golem. This chapter begins to delineate an allegorical ethics of the technological other through writings by Freud and Buber, and to affirm the experience of difference manifest through the anthropomorphic Golem. Wegener’s well-known film shows how this mystical figure of Jewish mythology not only allegorizes the cinema, but also how we as human spectators relate to this technology. In Chapter 5, I discuss Lang’s Nibelungen and Arthur Robison’s Warning Shadows, bringing both of these films to bear on the problem of revenge. By setting these films in juxtaposition, and in context with ideas introduced by Scheler, Bloch, and others, I describe what the vengeful subject is in the process of becoming, righteous in her unyielding demand for retribution. By putting this\n\n18\n\nAfterlives\n\nuncompromising narrative in motion, I argue that these films teach spectators how to critique the metaphysics that grounds the ethics of total retaliation.\n\nIII And then the projectionist began to officiate at the film by Harold Lloyd. But who was there who could laugh? No mirth shook my diaphragm. My thoughts were on death, the grave, and the hereafter. And even as the man on the screen was performing some wonderful comic gag, I decided I would dedicate the rest of my life to God, and become a hermit. Joseph Roth, “The Conversion of a Sinner in Berlin’s UFA Palace” (1925)58 An analysis of the moments following Cesare’s awakening demonstrates how I bring the cyclical nature of life and death to bear on the ontology of film. Through the interaction between the allegory of cinema and the human viewer, we shall see how spectators are reminded not only of their own mortality, but also of their relationship to the moving image. Cesare is now awake. He slowly raises his arms, as if to commence sleepwalking, while staring straight ahead in a trance. His master Caligari gestures for him to move forward. The unsettling thing then takes a few stiff steps, emerging bit by bit and deliberately from his wooden cabinet toward the edge of the stage closer to the viewer. After twenty-three years of sleep, Cesare evidently must relearn how to walk. A review published in Der Kinematograph on March 3, 1920, calls Conrad Veidt a “demonic type, playing a somnambulist that is simply uncanny [Unheimlich].” Indeed, Cesare’s movements do not derive from natural life, with the flexibility of organic limbs and appendages, but come off as bizarrely mechanical. This strange confluence of the mechanistic and the humanistic, and the inability of knowing where one category ends and the other begins, should be held responsible for creating the atmosphere of dread throughout the scene. Cesare’s transformation does not take place suddenly, as if A were to be immediately followed by B. Instead, his evolution toward life evinces vestiges of his previously inanimate state, as if to shed a dead membrane but without ever becoming fully separated from it. His chalky physiognomy does not stretch, is not elastic like the surface of human skin, and his rigid gestures somehow betray inflexible parts. It is unclear whether Cesare’s intentions for the world are good\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nor evil—he seems only to express a will toward animate life. His awakening is not only astonishing; it is also uncanny. The language of the Kinematograph film review thus compels a brief foray into Freud’s 1919 essay, “The Uncanny,” which will allow me to put the relationship between cinema and mortality into greater relief. One year after the war ended and one year before Caligari premiered in German theaters, the psychoanalyst writes that “Apparent death and re-animation of the dead have been represented as most uncanny themes.”59 Freud links the feeling of dread when seeing the dead reanimated to the return of the repressed, a link that underscores the discursive slippage between the Unheimlich and Heimlich. One knows that inanimate things cannot be willed to magically come to life, for the rational, modern self knows that this primitive fantasy is precisely that: childish fantasy surmounted in adulthood. And yet, in this scene from Caligari, it is so. Before the image of the somnambulist’s awakening face, one may remark to oneself, with astonishment: “So the dead do live on and appear on the scene of their former activities!”60 An experience may be characterized as uncanny when it conjures an immature belief that has been deemed false in adulthood, yet appears nevertheless as true. More fundamentally, Freud reminds us that the uncanny is a harkeningback to a moment when the ego had not yet delineated itself from the external world.61 During its early developmental stage, the ego narcissistically experienced time and space as boundless, and did not differentiate between itself and its surroundings. Never did the thought of death enter into the infantile consciousness. However, as the immature ego learns that life must be lived somehow in relation to civilized society, it also learns to recognize others as distinct from itself. Increasingly, life is perceived as a struggle as the appearance of uncontrollable strangers threatens the sovereign individual, who fears being lorded over by others. Nostalgic for the infantile experience of plentitude, the ego concocts defensive mechanisms that will safeguard its ontological unity, even as this unity takes on a fantasmatic form. In order for the modern subject to regain its infantile fantasy of unbounded living, it must shore up the truth of the self. In order to regain its sovereignty, the falsehoods and superstitions of man’s primitive past, including the belief in reanimated doubles, specters, and undead creatures of fictive myth, must be expelled from the realm of rational truth. Via the claim to enlightened reason, one is fantasmatically returned to the center of their own world. “But it is at this moment that the ‘double’ reverses its aspect. From having been an assurance of immortality, it becomes the uncanny harbinger of death.”62 The fantasmatic\n\n20\n\nAfterlives\n\ndouble, instead of assuring the spectator of her unending life, evokes intense dread and reminds her of her own mortality. Uncanniness thus finds its source in the confusion between the ego’s infantile fantasy and that which is believed to have been expunged from the self.63 Seeing the immobile come to life, the ego is forced to question whether its primordial fantasies have been overcome at all, for the uncanny returns what was repressed in the name of eternal life: its own finitude. We see precisely this radical self-questioning take place when a human onlooker encounters the uncanny Cesare and reminds him of his own death. Caligari, satisfied that his attraction has had a great effect on his audience, tips his hat and invites someone to approach the stage. “Ladies and Gentlemen Cesare the somnambulist will answer all your questions—Cesare knows every secret—Cesare knows the past and sees the future—Judge for yourselves. Don’t hold back—Ask away!” He invites his audience to test their credulity. The two protagonists of the film, Alan (played by Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) and Francis (Friedrich Fehér), who have come under the spell of his astonishing show, audaciously rush to the stage. They are instructed to halt before Cesare by Caligari’s cane. He circumspectly waves it in front of them, as if to underscore the impassable boundary between the spectator and the show, or between the living and the undead. While Alan and Francis are allowed to take distanced visual pleasure in the fantastic attraction, touching remains strictly taboo. In a medium shot, Alan looks upward toward Cesare and poses his question, one that tests the limits of what mortal creatures should be allowed to know: “How long will I live?” Cesare leans in slightly to disclose his secret: “Till the break of dawn.” His words overwhelm the young Alan, sending him into convulsions as he draws his next breath. He chokes and smiles slightly as if the whole thing were a joke, and is rendered helpless before the calamity induced by the somnambulist’s dismal prediction (Figure 0.3). Instead of fulfilling the narcissistic dream of man’s immortality, Cesare, the allegory of cinema, becomes the harbinger of his own imminent death. Throughout, his pale face remains severe and his eyes intense, heightening the drama of his prophecy. Later that night, Alan and Francis run into Jane (Lil Dagover), their shared love interest, and escort her back home. Francis declares, “Alan we both love her. We’ll leave the choice up to her—But whomever she chooses, we shall remain friends.”64 In light of Cesare’s portentous prophecy in Caligari’s tent, his promise of friendship remains ominous. With a cut to the intertitle, “Night,” and then to a shot of Alan sitting up in bed in fear and confusion, the\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nFigure 0.3 The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, 1920\n\nsomnambulist’s prediction is brutally realized. The young man struggles for the knife as he is repeatedly stabbed while his mouth screams in horror. Alan’s murder is depicted through a play of shadow and light, self-reflexive of the cinema screen, as the silhouettes of two struggling sets of hands are projected on the wall behind his bed. “How long will I live?” For Anton Kaes, this question restages “a central question for every soldier in the trenches; for every wife and mother on the home front, it was how long does he have to live? The mere question, asked in a film of 1920, recalled the war’s most traumatic presentiment.”65 Kaes notes that dying at dawn had a particular resonance for soldiers on the front. It was often early morning when they were commanded to emerge out of their trenches into the midst of enemy fire and ordered to expose their vulnerable body to anonymous gunfire and certain death. “In retelling Alan’s murder, Francis relives the shock of his friend’s untimely death at dawn—a suggestive allusion to the deaths of the dawn offensives, when soldiers often saw comrades near them killed in an instant.”66 The memory of loss in war is returned through the experience of the uncanny. Cesare’s body, awakening, and eccentric movement suggest a horrific hybrid between the organic and inorganic, occupying a zone of indeterminability between the human and the nonhuman. This scene suggests that the spectator’s life is implicated in the inorganic life of the cinema as well, allegorized through the intertwining relationship between Cesare and Alan. If the cinematic image is constituted by an uncanny ambivalence, that between animation and stasis,\n\n22\n\nAfterlives\n\nbetween profilmic past and present, Cesare’s prophecy coordinates Freud’s uncanny through the fundamental ambivalence of Alan’s own worldly being. His shock is connected, not only to the return of the repressed, but also to his realization that the progressive development of his life is simultaneous with his own death to come. The uncanny thus brushes up against this experience of finitude as a certain possibility: that while life grants duration to the living thing, it is simultaneously taken away as it moves toward this futural certainty (“Till the break of dawn”). The experience of war trauma makes this dialectic all the more significant, for it provides the historical context that underpins the profound ontology of animate life, explicated through the analysis of its temporality, existing somewhere at the intersection between past, present, and future. The ontology of film is thus particularly apposite in this regard, where the tension between analysis and intuition elaborated by Bergson in his “Introduction to Metaphysics” and the tension between death and life converge. Objects thought to be lost or forgotten are shown to have continued existence in the present, written by the pencil of nature on a light sensitive surface. This phenomenon overlaps with the fantasy of eternal life, precisely where, according to Bergson, we install ourselves in immobility: the dream of overcoming time and death, and the assurance that our loved ones, as well as ourselves, may transcend the unending passing of the now into the nonexistence of the past.67 The ontology of the photographic image lies in its capacity to satisfy, as Bazin puts it, “a basic psychological need,”68 to stave off death in perpetuity.69 And yet, the technological preservation of the past unavoidably invokes the uncanniness of death as soon as the intent to preserve is believed to have disavowed it. It is the uncanny, then, constituted through the undecidability between life and death, that seems to inspire Alan’s all too human question, and which will be repeatedly addressed throughout this book: “How long will I live?”\n\n1\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities Robert Reinert’s Nerves (1919)\n\nDefeat and delusion The end of the war left Germany with many lives lost. Approximately 2,037,000 soldiers fell on the battlefield throughout the four years of the conflict. Most men born after 1871 joined the German Army as it was considered a family’s greatest honor to have a father, uncle, or son serve the empire. Young males born between 1892 and 1895—who were between nineteen and twenty-two when the war began—experienced the greatest losses: about 35 percent of this generation was reduced. In addition to war casualties, civilian casualties numbered 760,000, largely due to the influenza pandemic and mass famine that devastated the Weimar population following the armistice in 1918.1 Of the 4.3 million German soldiers who returned from the front, many came back severely maimed, physically disabled, shell shocked, psychically scarred, and unable to reintegrate into civilian life. Weimar’s tumultuous postwar politics only exacerbated their sense of bewilderment and futility. The economic and political disorder of the early years of the Republic reminded returned soldiers of their failure to bring honor to the Fatherland and of the pointlessness of their military sacrifices. Forced to confront the empty vanity of their wartime patriotism, some veterans were filled with feelings of pessimistic contempt and exaggerated nationalism in response to their shattered self-importance. Like the infantile ego, described in Freud’s 1919 essay on the uncanny, that retreats into a shell when confronted with a hostile external world, some returned soldiers reverted to hyperbolic versions of their prewar selves in defiance of the armistice, whose terms the international community largely dictated. Moreover, those who remained in the home front reacted with incomprehension at the end of the war, their worst fears having been realized.\n\n24\n\nAfterlives\n\nHistorian Ernst Troeltsch, writing in 1924, famously called the Weimar Republic in its early years a “dreamland,” referring to the panoply of defensive fantasies concocted by the shamed ego, unable to accept military defeat.2 SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) leader Friedrich Ebert, who lost his two sons in the war, was supposedly “seized with sobbing,” so devastating was the initial broadcast of Germany’s loss.3 News of military defeat suddenly put the nation’s destiny into question, propagating many cynical discourses of crisis.4 Troeltsch observed that desperation gave way to wild speculation about what will be, so that “everyone, without grasping the conditions and real consequences, could portray the future in fantastic, pessimistic or heroic terms.”5 Visions of imagined utopias or cynical apocalypse proliferated: both revealed more about the confusion of the postwar present than of anything concrete about the future. Traditional ways of understanding German nationhood lost their capacity to idealize and consolidate the people. The cost of Germany’s postwar reparations compounded the emotional toll of defeat. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in June 1919, forced Germany to cede 13 percent of its prewar territory to Poland and France, and demanded recompense for all damage done to civilian property during wartime. During the armistice negotiations, France and Britain were particularly intent on placing full fault on the German nation. Reflecting their desire to place blame, article 231 of the Treaty obligated Germany to accept full responsibility for initiating the war, and “for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.”6 The total sum called for by the Allied Reparations Commission was set at 226 billion Reichsmarks, locking Germany into making long-term payments until the end of the century. At the end of the war, in the midst of increasing poverty, the polity splintered into a variety of political factions. Prewar solidarities within both the political left and right were broken up, giving rise to the consolidation of extreme political views. While pro-peace and pacifist coalitions were formed, other organizations advocated martial law and audaciously recapitulated grandiose annexationist claims in support of the military regime. Perhaps the most notorious example of the latter was the Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (German Fatherland Party), founded in 1917. At the end of the war, when it was becoming increasingly clear that Germany’s loss would be imminent, this extreme right-wing group stubbornly rejected defeat and promoted desperate measures, insisting that winning more territories abroad would solve Germany’s domestic crises.\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n25\n\nHistorian George Mosse, in Fallen Soldiers: Reshaping the Memory of the World War, writes of the reverberation of wartime attitudes into civilian politics, the “brutalization of German politics, a heightened indifference to human life” that pervaded public life.7 For many after the war, militarism and authoritarianism retained their revered status. Nothing less than a return to Prussian discipline could rein in the postwar chaos that threated to break apart national unity and German identity.8 As Mosse observes, it is this unquestioned regard for authority and the culture of submission that gave way to the uncompromising and callous treatment of political adversaries. “The process of the brutalization of politics is most easily followed in Germany with its cycle of revolution and counterrevolution after the war, and the years of political uncertainty under the Weimar Republic which followed.”9 The partisan politics of civilian political life was a direct transposition of the friend–enemy distinction operative in wartime.10 In what follows I will connect the postwar experience of loss and the brutalization of politics to a reactionary understanding of the cinema in the Weimar Republic. Toward the end of my reading of Wiene’s Caligari in the introduction, I connected Cesare’s awakening to questions of life and mortality. While the cinematic reanimation of the dead unconsciously confirmed the viewer’s fantasy of her own immortality, we saw how Cesare’s awakening also uncannily reminded the viewer of her own futural death. In the following reading of Robert Reinert’s frenetic 1919 film Nerven (Nerves), I will show how the fantasy of immortality, aligned with the experience of the moving image, is linked to two distinct, but related symptoms of trauma: hallucination and defiant triumphalism. Nerves is an exemplary film for connecting contemporaneous discourses concerning the “nerves” and nervousness to postwar male hysteria. Through its main male protagonists, Roloff and Teacher Johannes, Reinert’s film depicts two reaction-formations that seem unable to mourn and remain incapable of working through the past. Their etiologies coalesce around a key psycho-philosophical idea: the narcissistic metaphysics of the “cool,” distanced spectator.11 It is this metaphysics that underpins both the brutalization of politics and the withdrawal of human mortality from considerations of film ontology. By depicting how the postwar ego disavows that which threatens its fantasy of self-reliant wholeness— through the denial of shame, vulnerability, defeat, and empathy for the other— Reinert’s film allegorizes an ontology of film inseparable from the disavowal of death. Both the male protagonists of the film, living survivors of the war,\n\n26\n\nAfterlives\n\nadopt the dispassionate technics of the nonliving camera, reiterating the fantasy of having conquered time and mortality while shoring up the fantasy of the pretraumatized self. Indeed, life in Reinert’s film becomes a principal matter of concern for the postwar subject, reduced through its biopolitical understanding as either healthy or unhealthy, productive or unproductive, for the defeated nation. Though I will argue that Nerves implicates the representation of nervous exhaustion and its relationship to concerns around postwar masculinity, this relationship implicates psycho-philosophical stakes for the cinema spectator who disavows as well, whose look allows the cinema to “live.” Film theorist Jean-Louis Baudry has written that film “lives on the denial of difference: difference is necessary for it to live, but it lives on its negation.”12 Baudry was speaking about the impression of continuity produced through the succession of discrete images on a filmstrip projected onto a screen. The difference between each image must be disavowed so that the illusion of movement may be sustained—notably, this is an illusion that for Bergson corresponds to the fallacies of metaphysical thought. We shall see that this act of negation, performed by the spectator, is self-reflexively and allegorically signaled in Nerves. Through Roloff and Johannes, Reinert’s film illuminates how disavowal enables a postwar, solipsistic form of thinking that claims sovereignty over life and its vicissitudes.\n\nNerves (1919) and the Great War That the powers of death might be matched against life in one supreme combat, destiny had gathered them all at a single point. And behold how death was conquered; how humanity was saved by material suffering from the moral downfall which would have been its end; while the peoples joyful in their desolation, raised on high the song of deliverance form the depths of ruin and grief! Henri Bergson, The Meaning of the War (1915)13 In Shell Shock Cinema, Anton Kaes argues that Robert Reinert’s Nerves must be read through the experience of trauma that permeated all cultural production following the war. While the film does not show scenes of military combat, it nevertheless depicts the signs of the war’s aftermath registered in the bodies of returned soldiers—uncontrollable shakes, physical and psychic tremors, and\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n27\n\nvisual and auditory delusions. The language of the nerves and nervousness, utilized to explain these symptoms of shell shock, pre-dated the war by decades, however. Throughout the nineteenth century, these diagnostic categories assessed the psychosomatic effects of life in modernity and the effects of industrialization on the collective nation. “Seen from this angle,” Kaes writes, “war and revolution were symptoms of a larger malaise: a collective neurasthenia in response to belated but frenzied modernization and urbanization. The discourse on nerves also allowed the filmmaker to create a nexus between the battlefield and the home front.”14 Through the discourse of the nerves, Reinert’s film links the symptoms of shell shock to an already existing knowledge about the shock of modernization on the human body. It also links the language of nerves with the biopolitics of the nation and the need for healthy, productive citizens after wartime. Nerves should be contextualized within Weimar’s brutalizing politics, not only because it expresses anxieties associated with the traumatized subject, but also because it explicitly prescribes images of healthy, self-sufficient postwar masculinities, set over against the abjected, unhealthy, and dependent other. In her essay, “Unsettling Nerves: Investigating War Trauma in Robert Reinert’s Nerven (1919),” Barbara Hales considers Nerves within postwar understandings of male hysteria and the highly politicized discourse surrounding the war malingerer.15 “In contrast to the neurasthenic, who has the will but not the stamina, the hysteric possesses a faulty genetic make-up, resulting in the rejection of the will to fight.”16 At a time when the interpretation of war neurosis was thought to be a condition of a weak individual will and faulty nerves, traumatized soldiers were vilified for expressing their inability and refusal to reenter the battlefield. This vilification is illustrated in the first half of Nerves, in a scene where a female character brutally chastises a love-struck man who refuses to take part in the emerging revolutionary movements. He is terrified of the gunfights taking place in the streets and in defiance of her emasculating reprimands, which exacerbates his frail nerves, he randomly murders a stranger on the street. Soldiers who expressed resistance to returning to the front were correspondingly belittled for requesting pensions and psychiatric treatment for their ailments, and criticized for becoming burdens on the already struggling postwar state.17 In her article, Hales concludes that the vilification of the war neurotic is indicative of a larger denial, that is “of Germany’s overall inability to accept defeat.”18 Both Kaes and Hales account for the way in which Nerves reflects the inability to accept loss in Weimar culture, but the film’s depiction of the nerves, as a diagnostic language,\n\n28\n\nAfterlives\n\ncarries further reaching implications that call for additional philosophical and cinematic scrutiny. Reinert’s fervid film not only connects pre- and postwar notions of the human subject while linking home and war fronts through the depiction of male hysteria, it also allegorizes the encounter between the cinema and the nervous spectator. Nerves begins with a tumultuous prologue that dramatizes a mother on the home front and her soldier son, “thousands of miles from his Heimat.” The home and the war fronts are interrelated through parallel editing. Nerves alternates a shot of the mother, sensing impending danger, with a shot of a wounded young man gasping for life, crawling among dead bodies strewn about underneath a gnarled tree. Smoke floats in the background, suggesting the presence of gunfire (Figure 1.1). An intertitle indicates the existence of an unseen, telepathic connection between these different locations: “Mother, mother! And you feel it, thousands of miles away, at the same moment. What does it mean?” As the dying son cries out and slumps down, lifeless, the film cuts back to the horrified mother with her arms raised in exasperation. This episode seems to anticipate a sequence depicting Hutter and Ellen in Act Two of F. W. Murnau’s Nosferatu from 1922, where a similar telepathic connection between the husband and wife is forged through montage. As in this opening sequence from Reinert’s film, Ellen also reaches out when she senses Hutter in danger many miles away. Despite the great distance, the mother senses the life draining from her beloved offspring through the power of filmic editing. In the second episode of the prologue, a nervous man approaches a sleeping woman. With his shadow projected on the wall, as in the depiction of Alan’s\n\nFigure 1.1 Nerves, 1919\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n29\n\ndeath in Caligari, he violently strangles the vulnerable woman with his bare hands. The tense murderer then looks up and sees a small bird in a birdcage hanging near the woman’s bed. Suddenly feeling sympathy for the small creature, he remarks, “Poor little thing without any water: it is dying, dying.” He fills its small water silo and runs away from the scene of the crime. The relationship between these two episodes is not immediately apparent, but an intertitle that concludes the introduction suggests that both may be linked through the malady of troubled nerves: “Beware you peoples, shaken by nervous epidemics [Nervenepidemien], and terror and panic, or by wild, unbridled lust.” If Nerves reflects how an existing language of nervousness was connected to the symptoms of war trauma, the juxtaposition of these episodes utilizes the nerves to secure further connections between home and war fronts, and by coextension, the symptoms associated with both. Throughout the nineteenth century, the “nerves” were understood as lines of communication that connected the soul of a living being to its surrounding world, like a series of telegraph wires that connect the sender of a message to its receiver. American neurologist George M. Beard in 1869 coined the term “neurasthenia,” or nervous exhaustion, to describe the breakdown of these lines of communication. A reference text published in 1893, the Handbuch der Neurasthenie, indicates the speed and extent to which the discourse of nervous exhaustion, which Beard thought was a direct consequence of “American civilization,” entered into international scientific discourse. In a bibliographic chapter at the end of the text, hundreds of titles in German, English, and French that concern the symptoms of nervousness are listed. The category of the “nerves” concretized emerging scientific developments that linked psychology, physiology, and metaphysics in the nineteenth century, bringing together researchers from fields that were previously considered distinct. Understanding the nerves placed them in the shared task of explaining how they become excessively stimulated and exhausted in modern life. In Berlin Electropolis: Shock, Nerves, and German Modernity, historian Andreas Killen finds that while the discourse of hysteria has historically come to be associated with Vienna and Paris, “neurasthenia became closely connected to Wilhelmine Berlin.”19 Killen persuasively argues that the history of neurasthenia cannot be separated from Germany’s rapid industrialization between 1870 and 1914, as well as the myriad ways in which the Germanspeaking medical community debated the risks and pathologies of modern life. Physiologist Ludimar Hermann, in his Allgemeine Nervenphysiologie (General\n\n30\n\nAfterlives\n\nPhysiology of the Nerves), published in 1879, famously distinguished animal from plant life through the existence, in the case of the former, of a rational will. He surmised that animal life remains particularly vulnerable to external threat because their bodies are constituted through an interdependent system of nerves, such that “a defect of a part of the central nervous system results in a corresponding failure of the nerve and animal muscles on which they are dependent.”20 This is why the deleterious effect of urbanization and the mental stresses concomitant with the introduction of new technologies (such as the telegraph and the telephone) are particularly hazardous for human beings. Modernity affects the human animal in its totality. Hermann advises suffering, nervous individuals to return to nature and take up physical exercise so that the nerves may be “toughened,” optimized, and returned to healthiness. In his 2008 study, Cult of the Will, Michael Cowan correspondingly shows how late nineteenth and early twentieth-century discourses of the will were mobilized to tame bodily and spiritual nervousness. Tics, spasms, paralysis, and other signs of nervous ailment attest to the weakness of the internal will, and its inability to rein in nervous pathologies. “More than any other,” writes Cowan, “the nervous subject appeared to be determined from the outside in and, correspondingly, unable to impose his subjectivity from the inside out.”21 The nervous subject, like the war malingerer, lacked the will to life, and was quickly deemed unfit to endure the shocks and stresses of modern civilization. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the discourse of the nerves gave way to further reaching speculations, and was often invoked to explain supernatural phenomena. Between 1900 and 1913 a journal series, Grenzfragen des Nervenund Seelenlebens, repeatedly utilized the vocabulary of nerves for understanding topics that did not fall within the discursive purview of contemporary science: somnambulism, hypnosis, the relationship between neurosis and creativity, and the etiology of hysteria. In the second volume, the neurologist Heinrich Obersteiner makes explicit a key connection between nerves and nervous exhaustion (Nervenabspannung): “Commonly all purely functional symptoms or groups of symptoms on the part of the nervous systems belong to a range of psychic symptoms, when they are manifest outward as in the case of hysterical paralysis.”22 Obersteiner identifies the pineal body as the “soul-organ of Descartes,” isolating this endocrine gland, located between the two hemispheres of the brain, as the seat of Cartesian epistemology. Mind and body congeal in the nerves, while idealist philosophy is inseparable from the physiology and morphology of the human body. Though he grounds his theory of the ego in the\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n31\n\norgans of the nervous system, Obersteiner nevertheless reiterates the sovereignty of the self as a singular, irreducible substance. When put through the torment of modern warfare, the nerves undergo unprecedented agitation. In his 1915 text Der Krieg und die Nerven (The War and the Nerves), neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer takes up the argument perpetuated by Obersteiner, and maintains that the constitution of the soldier is linked to the fitness of the nervous system, particularly to “the brain, the organ of our soul, where thinking, feeling and human action originates.”23 Alzheimer, who had already been recognized for identifying the symptoms of late-onset dementia now referred to as “Alzheimer’s disease,” emphasizes the relationship of the nerves to the mettle of the German people in wartime. He isolates the brain as the seat of courage: “Where we speak of tough nerves, a brave heart, or cold blood, we are really talking about the accomplishments of the brain.”24 Alzheimer links the strong warrior, in a seemingly Nietzschean vein, to the efficient and proper functioning of the nervous system. While the brain cannot be separated from the nerves, he nevertheless retains the privileged function of this organ as the site of cogitation. The discourse of the nerves connected physiology to psychic and emotional phenomena, but in wartime it allowed writers such as Alzheimer to posit a self besieged by external forces. Medical practitioners, philosophers, and many other thinkers invested in the notion of healthy nerves exploited this discourse to nostalgically recuperate the certainty of a self that pre-dates the experience of war trauma. Alzheimer recounts the life-changing physiological and emotional traumas experienced by soldiers on the front: They found themselves in the immediate vicinity of a grenade and were severely wounded by an exploding shell. Because of this violent terror, some have lost their ability to speak or hear and became deaf and silent, experiencing paralysis in both legs or in one-half of their body, having cramps, or entered into a dazed state, a traumatic, foggy condition of consciousness, in which the sick do not know their orientation in place and time, are confused, and often express experiences of terror or something to that effect.25\n\nAlzheimer calls for the hardening of one’s nerves in wartime (this time in the vein of Ernst Jünger), in order to fend off the deleterious effects of combat and obviate the dulling of one’s “prudence, calm, and clarity of the faculty of judgment.”26 The whole self, defined as a tightly bounded set of nerves, may be regained by fortifying them against all unforeseen external threats. Alzheimer\n\n32\n\nAfterlives\n\nalso acknowledges those on the home front who have also experienced traumas that are no less devastating—the loss of loved ones. He expresses concern for the future of the German family, and for those who must care for traumatized fathers and brothers returned from the battlefield.27 An intertitle from Reinert’s film explicitly figures the nerves as central to the healthy functioning of the human body, for their failure precipitates the devolution of the human soul: “Nerves, you mysterious avenues of the soul, you messengers of highest desire and deepest suffering. If you fail, man is but animal. Nerves, are you not the soul itself?” Healthy nerves constitute a healthy individual fit for civilized life, undergirded by a network of what Alzheimer calls “white strands that run from the brain and spinal cord through the body to the sense organs.”28 Reinert’s appropriation of the discourse of the nerves in 1919 parallels Alzheimer’s view of the nerves as central to physical and mental fitness formulated in 1915. The nerves must be prepared for endurance, both at home and on the war front, until the Fatherland achieves victory in the war. The cinema, as a medium that excites the senses, is particularly suited to reenacting the shocks of war on the nervous system, and for constituting a form of postwar thinking that struggles to recover some semblance of the prewar past. In Reinert’s film, it is the failure of the nerves and the subsequent disavowal of this failure that gives rise to the production of visual delusions. The indicators of neurasthenia resultant from the war and described by Alzheimer earlier correspond with those depicted in the character of Roloff in Nerves. Like “those who found themselves in the immediate vicinity of a grenade and were severely wounded by an exploding shell,” this character experiences sudden explosions and exhibits traumatic symptoms akin to shell shock. It is to him I will now turn.\n\nRoloff: From trauma to vision Following the prologue, Nerves begins its narrative proper as the prominent industrialist Roloff (Eduard von Winterstein) and his wife Elisabeth (Lia Borré) celebrate the five-hundredth anniversary of “The House of Roloff.” Marja (Erna Morena), his sister, is to be married to the aristocratic Richard (Rio Ellbon), the Count of Colonna. However, Marja loves Teacher Johannes (Paul Bender), whom she has known since her student days. In the film’s opening act, Roloff stands before a mass gathering and announces that his machines will allow him and his followers to conquer the earth and make them “masters of the world.”\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n33\n\nAt the very moment Roloff announces his megalomaniac plans for global domination, and as his mesmerized listeners raise their fists in victory, the film suddenly cuts to a shot of his factories exploding into flames. Instead of allowing him to conquer the world, Roloff ’s machines collapse in a pile of rubble. Their detonations recall the experience of sudden blasts and unpredictable enemy fire that threatened the safety of the soldier during trench warfare. The explosion “destroys the newly opened factory,” and Roloff ’s followers are sent into pandemonium (Figure 1.2). Amid the mounting state of emergency, Teacher Johannes makes an appearance before the people and, to quell the rising chaos and confusion, begins speaking of the nation’s collective trauma. “The peoples are mourning on bloody battlefields,” he remarks. Making explicit reference to the recently concluded war, Johannes calls for the end of the “greed for power which marched across the earth like some hideous beast”. Meanwhile, Roloff convalesces at home, incapacitated with a serious case of the nerves (Figure 1.3). “I used to have nerves of steel, but since then,” he says to his wife Elisabeth, “I keep seeing the ghosts of the dead rising to wreak their terrible revenge on us, and especially on me.” Intercut with his words are two short shots that express his inner turmoil: one repeats the exploding factories in flashback and another depicts a young man holding a large sword and standing over corpses on a battlefield. The latter image corresponds to a shot from the prologue featuring the war dead and a gnarled tree. Here, however, it is more ominous, evoking the Sword of Damocles while also symbolizing two historical catastrophes: one that has already taken place and one that soon will occur.\n\nFigure 1.2 Nerves, 1919\n\n34\n\nAfterlives\n\nFigure 1.3 Nerves, 1919\n\nFilm scholar Philipp Stiasny, in his reading of Reinert’s film, corroborates the connection between the exploding factories and the shock of military loss: “The collapse of his old factories through an unexpected explosion, the experience of shock followed by his disturbance, is a powerful metaphor for Germany’s defeat in the war and the collapse of the empire.”29 The collapse of the old order gives way to uncertainty and dread about the future. In his analysis, Stiasny makes a direct comparison between the fictional Roloff and the historical Wilhelm II. While the industrialist flees into a state of agitated nerves, the Kaiser fled into Holland after the war. Correspondingly, Stiasny notes, the shock of Germany’s collapse is registered through Roloff ’s breakdown. While riots take place in the streets, Marja challenges their nervous gardener, who has secretly loved her since childhood, to action. “Down there people are fighting for their lives and you’re running around love struck, you coward!” Her denunciation inflames him. “I am no coward,” he later protests to his mother and father. Highly agitated, he grabs an ax, enters a busy intersection of his town, and chops down the first stranger who accosts him. The humiliated gardener is quickly apprehended by passersby on the street, stood against a wall, and put to death by a line of bayonets. Meanwhile, people on the streets march and engage in firefights, as factions vie to gain control following the social and political chaos unleashed by Roloff ’s exploding factories. Reinert’s depictions of crowd mobilization, street riots, and mass chaos in Nerves reflect the demand for change driven not by ideology, but by the melodramatic politics of the postwar self.\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n35\n\nIndeed, these scenes and the emergence of an increasingly brutalized politics recall the dramatic events that took place between the end of the war and the signing of the Weimar Constitution. On November 7, 1918, over 60,000 war-weary workers and soldiers gathered in the Theresienwiese and forced the abdication of the Bavarian king. Filled with revolutionary zeal, and with no official government in place, they declared a new Soviet Republic, the Freistaat Bayern. One week after Lenin sent a message of greetings to the Bavarian Soviet Republic in early May 1919, the Freikorps and other soldiers, still loyal to the German Army, stormed Munich and defeated the Socialists in a series of gun battles and street fights.30 When the Weimar Constitution was signed in August 1919, Munich became a hotbed for extreme rightwing politics, gathering those who felt betrayed by the government and who demanded a return to the nationalist Fatherland.31 Reinert must have reflected upon these dramatic political turnovers as he was producing the crowd scenes and filming on-location in Munich during this period of great instability. According to a 1919 article from Der Kinematograph, he employed “thousands” of unemployed people to play the agitated masses.32 It is conceivable that many of these unemployed extras took part in the actual rioting that took place in Munich. So that she may prepare for the coming political utopia, Marja calls off her arranged marriage to Richard, rejecting bourgeois social affiliations. This bond would have maintained the long-standing reputation of Roloff and his lineage. Marja confesses that she does not love the count. On the other hand, she is driven by a passionate desire for a new societal order, one that will interrupt old habits and do away with traditional social relations. Her brother Roloff, shocked by her decision to call off the wedding, asks, “For God’s sake, what’s the matter with you?” He desperately urges Marja to speak, violently shaking her shoulders and pleading with her. Overcome with shame, she is unable to explain why Johannes “possesses” her while Richard does not. Her continuing intransigence exacerbates Roloff ’s “overwrought nerves” (überreizten Nerven) and incites his delusional imagination. The film cuts to a brief hallucination, belonging to Roloff, of Teacher Johannes forcing himself onto Marja. Like the repeated memories of his exploding factories, the hallucination appears in a moment of extreme anxiety. In the brief cutaway scene, Johannes aggressively grabs Marja and, overcoming her resistance, kisses her. When the film cuts back, Roloff has already convinced himself that his sister was the victim of sexual assault. “I swore I saw it …,” he gravely remarks (Figure 1.4).\n\n36\n\nAfterlives\n\nFigure 1.4 Nerves, 1919\n\nRoloff ’s imagined testimony is later used as evidence in the film’s courtroom sequence, proof that indicts Johannes as an adulterer. While Roloff confuses delusion and reality, he is nevertheless clearheaded about the political opportunity that has arisen from Johannes’s guilt and besmirched reputation. In a conversation with the district attorney following the trial, Roloff notes that this is their opportunity to “eliminate our most powerful enemy.” His cynical politics would have resonated with Munich audiences who witnessed rapid exchanges of power in 1918 and 1919, exchanges founded on delusions of the other and driven by the thirst for revenge. These bitter sentiments, like those held by Roloff, reiterate stark political lines that were drawn between political factions in the Weimar Republic, particularly between the Spartacist League, the SPD, and the nationalistic right. Roloff ’s delusion is shown two more times in Nerves, like a repetition compulsion, each constituting key moments in its plot. With each reiteration, Roloff begins to question whether the memory actually took place. He is unable to exculpate his traumatic memories, while his desperate self-scrutinizing only further escalates his nervous suffering. Meanwhile, as the film unfolds, his delusions become increasingly bizarre and extreme. Portrayed through in-camera special effects, Roloff sees himself wandering through a distorted forest, then drifting through an angry crowd of people, and later choking his wife. While the discourse of the nerves and nervousness describes his agitated condition, Roloff ’s mounting anxiety and hallucination, particularly the sexual content of his vision of Marja’s assault, seem to gesture toward another mode of explanation that was quickly gaining currency after the war: the\n\nTwo Postwar Masculinities\n\n37\n\nscience of psychoanalysis. It is this discourse that will allow us to clearly see how and why Roloff continues to hallucinate as a massive effort to shore up his traumatized self. Freud’s 1908 essay, “ ‘Civilized’ Sexual Morality and Modern Nervousness,” shifts the analytical concerns regarding neurasthenia away from the nerves themselves to the area of psychic life. The essay responds directly to Christian von Ehrenfels’s paper “Sexualethik,” published in Grenzfragen des Nervenund Seelenlebens, and quotes at length passages on the nerves from Wilhelm Heinrich Erb, Otto Ludwig Binswanger, and sexologist Richard von Kraft-Ebbig. While commenting on contemporaneous tracts on neurasthenia written by these and other researchers, Freud moves away from “the less definite forms of ‘nervousness’ ” in order to consider “the actual forms of nervous disease.”33 The psychoanalyst argues that neurotic disorder may be linked to the interdictions imposed by modern sexual ethics, and that the actual origins of what is called neurasthenia may be traced back to “the undue suppression of the sexual life in civilized peoples (or classes) as a result of the ‘civilized’ sexual morality which prevails among them.”34 Freud thus shifts from the organic-mechanistic terminology of neurasthenia to the psychoanalytic vocabulary of neurosis and the politics of civilized sexuality. Still, Freud acknowledges the crucial link between neurosis and the stresses of modernity, yet a negative one, by asserting that neurosis remains a type of sexual expression that defies societal prohibition. Neurosis is a flight from psychic conflict into disease when the libido cannot find its normal path to satisfaction in modern life.35 In short, neurosis in psychoanalysis is the symptomatic expression of illicit wishes repressed by society. This interpretation of sexual desire allowed Freud to consider cases of nervousness beyond the discourse of the nerves, beyond their excitability and exhaustibility, theorized by writers such as Obersteiner and Alzheimer, and to reconsider symptoms such as melancholy and anxiety. If Nerves is an allegory about war trauma, then a psychoanalytic consideration of damaged nerves allows us to assess its psychophilosophical etiology. Freud’s colleague, analyst Karl Abraham, was afforded the opportunity to observe the symptoms of war trauma directly during his service to the Fatherland as the chief physician of the Berlin Grunewald military hospital. Donning an official uniform, sword, and heavy boots, he received injured soldiers and treated their physical and mental wounds.36 In January 1915, Abraham wrote to Freud describing his observation of nervous symptoms already familiar to him:\n\n38\n\nAfterlives I have seen a number of traumatic neuroses, well known to us from peacetime, in a typical form. They were all men who had had accidents at the front, such as being run over; they had not been wounded. I have also seen several severe cases of hysteria in men knocked unconscious by explosions. They mostly have aphasia-abasia and hysterical attacks.37\n\nTwo months later, in early March, he was relocated to Allenstein in East Prussia in order to continue his work with traumatized soldiers. There he observed signs of male hysteria, corresponding to archetypes of the prewar “impotent male.” This correspondence between prewar and postwar subject formations quickly confirmed for Abraham that the symptoms of war trauma should be diagnosed as stemming from some unknown, unconscious sexual irregularity. Abraham’s experience with returned soldiers thus convinced him that psychoanalysis could serve as a viable curative method. His analysis of neurosis, and its link to sexual repression, suggested therapeutic solutions other than those resolved by Fritz Kaufmann’s electrotherapy, the most popular method of dealing with war trauma at the time. “Kaufmannization” combined verbal suggestion with five minutes of high-voltage electrical current, in order to “reset” the nerves back to health.
