        "text": "Following the establishment of the Dominion of Canada, Queen Victoria signed a royal warrant on May 26, 1868, designating coats of arms for the four original provinces—Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. The golden lion on red in the New Brunswick coat of arms may refer to the arms of England (a red shield with three golden lions) or to the arms of the duchy of Brunswick in Germany, which has two golden lions on red. On the bottom part of the New Brunswick shield is the heraldic vessel known as a lymphad, which may refer to the ship-building activities of the province or to the vessels in which many Loyalists arrived in New Brunswick from the United States in the late 18th century.\n\nWhen the Canadian Red Ensign was abandoned in 1965, the government of New Brunswick decided for the first time to create a distinctive provincial flag. Two heraldic experts, Robert Pichette and Alan B. Beddoe, gave a striking new artistic interpretation to the coat of arms in the form of an armorial banner. Although this is the “normal” way of making a flag according to the laws of heraldry, it is in fact rare in practice among nations and their primary subdivisions. (For other examples of armorial banners, see the flags of Nova Scotia, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island.) Usage of this flag could simply have been introduced on the basis of the 1868 royal warrant, but instead an order in council was issued by the lieutenant governor acting on the advice of the New Brunswick Executive Council. The flag was proclaimed by the lieutenant governor on February 24, 1965, and it was first officially hoisted on March 25."
