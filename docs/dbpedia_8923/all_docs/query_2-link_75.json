        "text": "Description\n\nBraunschweig (Brunswick) is in northwestern Germany. It was made a Duchy (province) of the Holy Roman Empire in 1235. The Dukes wove themselves into the European dynastic system. Luneburg is a town that produced most of the salt used in northern Germany, which made it rich enough to join the Hanseatic League of commercial towns. Changing circumstances destroyed the salt trade. The town was attached to Hanover in 1708. Calenburg in now in Hanover. It carried various rulers on its back over the centuries. Hanover is in Lower Saxony in northern Germany. The Brunswick dukes produced a line based in Hanover that supplied several kings of England."
