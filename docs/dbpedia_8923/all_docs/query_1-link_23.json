        "text": "Franklin James Kreutzer (born February 7, 1939) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher who appeared in 78 games over all or part of six seasons with the Chicago White Sox and Washington Senators (1964– and ). A left-hander from Buffalo, New York, Kreutzer stood tall and weighed . Kreutzer attended Villanova University and began his nine-year professional career in in the Boston Red Sox' organization. That November, he was selected by the White Sox in the first-year player draft then in force. He made his MLB debut on September 20, 1962, throwing 1 innings of shutout relief against the Red Sox at Comiskey Park. He also pitched for the White Sox in 18 other contests through July 15, 1964. Thirteen days later, he was the \"player to be named later\" to complete a July 13 deal in which Chicago acquired first baseman Bill Skowron from Washington for Joe Cunningham.\n\n0\n\nHart van Nederland (Dutch: Heart of the Netherlands) is a national festival in the Netherlands. It is a week-long celebration of Dutch culture, history and art. The festival takes place each summer in several locations across the Netherlands. Hart van Nederland was first held in 1951, and has been celebrated every year since then. The main focus of the festival is to promote Dutch culture and art, and to celebrate the country's diversity. The festival also aims to promote international cooperation between the Netherlands and its neighbouring countries. The festival takes place in several locations across the Netherlands, including The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam and Eindhoven. Each location hosts a variety of events and festivals throughout the week-long celebration. The Hart van Nederland Foundation organizes and promotes the event.\n\n1\n\nDamocles (main article) was a legendary Greek figure who, according to some versions of the story, was a king who refused to allow his people to make sacrifices to the gods in order to avert a famine. Damocles is used as a metonym for a sword that hangs by a single blade from an overhead beam, threatening anyone who draws it with death. The sword's appearance is said to have inspired the metaphor of life being a sword held over one's head.\n\n1\n\nThe Southsea Shakespeare Actors are an amateur theatrical group in Southsea, Hampshire, England. It has produced nearly 200 plays, of which around two-thirds have been by William Shakespeare. It was the first amateur group in the world to perform the entire Shakespearean canon of plays, during the 1960s, for which it has won a Guinness World Record - it repeated this achievement in 1997. Members have included the naval historian Colin White. It was formed in 1947 at St Peter's Hall in the town, with Donald Wolfit as its patron and K. Edmonds Gateley MBE as both its founder and its first main director. It moved to the South Parade Pier Theatre in the 1950s. When the Pier declined it moved again to the King's Theatre, performing there during the 1970s and early 1980s before becoming more multi-venue (albeit with the Portsmouth Arts Centre and New Theatre Royal as its main venues). It has also played at the Edinburgh Festival and has a youth wing, known as 'Upstage!'.\n\n0\n\nB'Rock Orchestra (pronounced as bee rock) is a Swedish rock band formed in 2002. The band's style incorporates elements of funk, soul, R&B and rock. The band has released two albums, \"B'Rock Orchestra\" (2002) and \"Back to Basics\" (2006).\n\n1\n\nThe 1911 Festival of Empire was the biggest single event held at The Crystal Palace in London since its opening. It opened on 12 May and was one of the events to celebrate the coronation of King George V. The original intention had been that Edward VII would open it in 1910, however, this was postponed after his death shortly before the planned opening day. The Festival contained a display of landscapes and exhibits from the British Empire, mainly the dominion countries, to encourage emigration to those nations; and it contained a large scale pageant dramatising British history. It was described at the time as ‘a social gathering of the British family’ encouraging the ‘firmer welding of those invisible bonds which hold together the greatest empire the world has ever known’. It has since been described as the ‘ultimate imperialist propaganda showcase’. Context Robert George Windsor-Clive, first Earl of Plymouth, Conservative government minister managed and promoted the Festival as a sub contracted event; it was nothing to do with the Crystal Palace company which was in receivership at the time. The 1911 Festival of Empire was one of many imperial propaganda events staged in the early twentieth century in Britain and around the Empire, following the 1909 Imperial International Exhibition at London's White City and running parallel to the 1911 Delhi Durbar in India. The 1911 Festival of Empire was staged at The Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill and had similar characteristics to the Great Exhibition, for which the palace was initially built, in that it displayed an array of products and exhibits from countries around the world and promoted a western industrial culture and pro-Empire view of the world.\n\n0\n\nI believe that may just be a result of his military service. The same thing happened to Solid Snake. As we age our hair follicles stop producing pigment. For some people this can happen relatively early in their life, as dictated by their genetics. This may or may not be abnormal, depending upon your cousin's ethnicity ; for causcasians under 20, or African Americans under 30, the appearance of silver hair is categorized as \"premature graying,\" caused by a loss of two pigments (i.e. eumelanin and pheomalanin). Graying does not typically indicate a medical problem, and is most likely from genetic causes. Vitamin B-12 deficiency and issues with pituitary or thyroid glands can cause premature graying.\n\n0\n\nThe white-lipped tree frog (Nyctimystes infrafrenatus) is a species of frog in the Nyctimystidae family. It is endemic to Sri Lanka. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.\n\n1\n\nMethanococcoides burtonii is a methylotrophic methanogenic archaeon that inhabits the deep sea. It is a facultative anaerobe that can utilize a variety of carbon sources, including methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Methanococcoides burtonii was discovered in 1985 by Dr. R. Burton and Dr. P.S.Spencer at the University of California, Santa Barbara. It was first characterized as a methylotroph in 1988 and has since been used as a model organism to study methylotrophy and methanogenesis. Methanococcoides burtonii is capable of metabolizing a wide range of organic compounds including methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Its ability to utilize these carbon sources is thought to be an adaptation to its environment, which is characterized by low levels of oxygen and high levels of methane.\n\n1\n\nKalmar Bloodbath (Swedish: Kalmar blodbad) was a civil war fought in the Swedish province of Kalmar between 1505 and 1508. The war was fought between the Danish king Christian I and the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, who were both vying for control of Kalmar. The war resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, and at its conclusion, Kalmar was almost completely destroyed.\n\n1\n\nHutsul Secession (also called Carpathian style or East Galician style) is an architectural style which developed in Eastern Galicia, particularly in Lviv. The style embodies the first attempt to create a national Ukrainian style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The style is based on local folk architecture, but incorporates elements of other regional Secession styles. Specifically, the Vienna Secession coupled with the folk architecture of the Hutsul highlanders formed the basis of the Hutsul Secession. The most prominent Hustul Secessioinist was Ivan Levynskyi, who headed a firm of several other architects, including Tadeusz Obmiński, Oleksandr Lushpynskyi, and Lev Levynskyi. Description The Hutsul Secession style includes large, sloping roofs with elaborate contours. The buildings are often topped with towers akin to the bell towers of Hutsul churches. Also drawn from the Hutsul folk architecture is the range of color and décor from the utilization of metals and ceramics in the decorative aspects of buildings. The forms of the windows, awnings, and doorways are distinctly elastic, embodying the expressive forms of the movement.\n\n0\n\nAmelia S. Bold Fowler (1862 in England – January 9, 1923 in Boston, Massachusetts), an embroidery teacher and well-known flag preserver, was the master needle worker who restored the original Star Spangled Banner in 1914. By that time, the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the United States national anthem was just \"a frail piece of bunting.\" But Fowler called upon her patented preservation techniques to save it from further deterioration. She used dyed-to-match silk thread and employed ten assistants to reinforce the relic. They anchored it onto Irish linen with 1.7 million of Fowler's special honeycomb patterned, six-sided stitches. It took eight weeks to finish the preservation process. Upon completion, she claimed the restored flag would \"defy the test of time,\" and charged the government $1,243. Eighty-four years later, in 1998, ongoing conservation efforts at the Smithsonian Institution budgeted $18.2 million to preserving the same flag. Today, all of the stitches from Fowler's earlier preservation attempt have been removed, as well as the linen backing.\n\n0\n\nIssam al-Attar is a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, a symbol of resistance to Hafez al-Assad, and in exile in Aachen, Germany since the 1970s. He was born in 1927 in Syria. He was the second Supreme Guide of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, taking over from its founder, Mustafa al-Siba'i, in 1961. His sister, Najah al-Attar is the Vice President of Syria and is the only woman to have served in the post, which she has held since 2006. Previously she was Minister of Culture from 1976 to 2000. His wife was assassinated by a death squad sent by Assad. Attar was denied re-entry to Syria by the newly installed Ba'athist government following a hajj trip to Mecca in 1963, and has lived in exile in Germany since the 1970s. Attar was in turn removed from his position as Supreme Guide in 1980 as a result of poor health and due to repeated government victories in the Islamic uprising in Syria. He has led the Talaa’i organization in Germany since the late 1970s, which works mostly with non-Syrian Muslims. He still consults with the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood on Syria related issues.\n\n0\n\nZhang Xingcheng (587 – October 10, 653), courtesy name Deli, posthumously known as Duke Ding of Beiping, was a Chinese official who served as a chancellor during the reigns of the emperors Taizong and Gaozong in the Tang dynasty. Background Zhang Xingcheng was born in 587, during the reign of Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. He was from Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), and in his youth, he studied under a man named . Liu was impressed with his studiousness, and told his other students, \"Mr. Zhang does what is proper, and he is material to be an imperial official later.\" Toward the end of the reign of Emperor Wen's son, Emperor Yang, Zhang was recommended by the officials of his home commandery, and he was made a reserve assistant to the imperial surveyor. After Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), in 618 in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji, the Sui officials at the eastern capital Luoyang supported Emperor Yang's grandson, Yang Tong (the Prince of Yue), as emperor, but the official Wang Shichong seized the throne in 619, ending Sui and establishing his own state of Zheng. Wang made Zhang his minister of census.\n\n0\n\nNorbert Wolfgang Stephan Hann von Hannenheim (15 October 1811 – 21 May 1884) was a German general, politician and statesman. He is considered one of the fathers of the German Army. Norbert von Hannenheim was born into a noble family in Frankfurt am Main, the son of Count von Hannenheim-Schonborn and his wife Countess Amalie von Waldburg-Zeil. He attended the University of Bonn and the Military Academy at Vienna, where he graduated as a lieutenant in 1836. He served in the Austrian army during the revolutions of 1848 and 1849. In 1852 Hannenheim was appointed military governor of Schleswig-Holstein, a post he held until 1860. In this period he played a leading role in quelling the Schleswig-Holstein Rebellion. In 1860 he was made military governor of Hanover, a post he held until 1870. In this period Hannenheim played a leading role in suppressing the riots which followed the death of Robert Wilhelm, Duke of Brunswick. In 1870 Hannenheim was appointed generalissimo of all German armies. He played an important role in concluding the Franco-Prussian War and in reorganizing Germany after its defeat. In 1878 he was made honorary president of the Prussian War Academy. Hannenheim died in Berlin aged 79.\n\n1\n\nPucciniomycotina is a subdivision of fungus within the phylum Ascomycota. The name is derived from the Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini, who first studied the taxonomy of fungi in the early 1900s. Pucciniomycotina is a group of fungi that are closely related to members of the genus Penicillium. These fungi form a widespread group, found in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Pucciniomycotina fungi are characterised by their ability to form symbiotic relationships with plants. These partnerships provide the fungus with a source of food and protection from environmental stressors. Pucciniomycotina fungi are important contributors to the global economy. They are used as ingredients in medications and food products, and their biomass is used for energy production. The group is also responsible for significant environmental damage, particularly in water resources. However, research into Pucciniomycotina fungus has led to new insights into plant-fungus symbioses and how they contribute to ecosystems.\n\n1\n\nIt's based on math. You need two dimensions to determine the location on a piece of paper, or plane. You need three dimensions to determine the position in space. the fourth dimension you can determine the position in space at any given time. What will blow your mind is getting you head around the fact that some scientist believe their are even MORE dimensions. We move through time, experienced by the dynamic flow of material objects moving through the three spacial dimensions. We can observe one dimension (a point), two dimensions (a line), three dimensions (a prism), and can just as easily mathematically represent four, five, six, etc, all the way up to infinite dimensional objects. Our eyes and brains are only calibrated to see up to three dimensions (arguably consciousness allows us to perceive time as a fourth), but through math we can show that higher dimensions exist. Some incredibly complex math and physics problems have only been solved (so far, at least) by using more than three dimensions.\n\n0\n\nCharley ATL was Azerbaijani progressive art rock band formed in 1987. History Charley ATL was founded in 1987, their one and only released album was \"Dedicated to victims of Indian Cinema\" in 1990. Their style were often compared to King Crimson, Dire Straits and Deep Purple by then in Azerbaijani rock magazine (samizdat) \"Rokoko\" which was founded itself by band member - Vahid Mustafayev (brother of Chingiz Mustafayev). Their major appearance on stage was during \"Rokoko\" rock music festival which took place in September, 1991 in Green Theatre. Their first and only music video \"Körpə\" (Baby) was released in 1993 and was circulated in ANS TV till 1998. Whilst most of bands then sang in Russian, Charley ATL was singing in Azerbaijani. They style derived from folk as well, tar was used as an instrument. Lyrics were heavily sarcastic. Band was eventually split up in 1995 and most of their members left to work in ANS TV.\n\n0\n\nMário Rodrigues Breves Peixoto (; March 28, 1881 – November 3, 1936) was a Brazilian writer, journalist, and statesman. He was the author of the novel Os Lusíadas (1924), which tells the story of the Portuguese voyage of exploration of the Atlantic Ocean under the leadership of Vasco da Gama. Peixoto was born in Rio de Janeiro into a poor family of farmers. He began working at a young age, and soon developed an interest in writing. He published his first short story in 1902 and became a journalist in 1904. In 1911 he was elected to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies as a Republican. In 1930 he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Getúlio Vargas. Peixoto died in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 60 after a long illness. His remains were cremated and his ashes scattered over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n1\n\nWilliam J. Karins (born April 14, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the NBA. He played college basketball for the University of Notre Dame. Karins was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the 1997 NBA draft. He played for the Bucks, Toronto Raptors, and Phoenix Suns. He averaged 8.4 points and 2.5 rebounds per game over his career.\n\n1\n\nA good explosive demolition company can knock down a skyscraper or other large building by \"implosion\". You blow up carefully selected support beams, and if you do it right, [the entire building collapses into itself, entirely within its original footprint] (URL_0). You still get some clouds of dust/possibly debris, but hopefully not anything big enough to do damage to nearby structures. Manually dismantling the structure from top to bottom and carting the waste down in big elevators is another workable method, although it might be unsafe, depending on the condition of the building you're demolishing. A Japanese construction company worked out a technique where you [support the first floor on hydraulic pistons, demolish the first floor, lower the pistons, and then repeat on the next floor, dismantling the building from the bottom up] (URL_1), which is pretty trippy. Alternately, you can repair or add to the structure to keep it going. There was a thing on this a while ago there are crews who have exterior scaffolding that they move from the top floors down dismantling everything as they go Sometimes they are built to be repurposed. The Chrysler headquarters is designed that if Chrysler goes out of business and they can't find a new office tenant, the building can be turned into a shopping mall.\n\n0\n\nBeing considered an adult in the eyes of the law means that you are legally responsible for your actions and can be held accountable for breaking the law. This means that if you commit a crime, you can be tried in a court of law and potentially punished. The legal drinking age, on the other hand, is the age at which it is legally allowed to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. This age is set by each country or state and is generally higher than the age at which a person is considered an adult in the eyes of the law. This is because alcohol can be harmful to a person's health, especially when consumed in excess or by people who are not fully developed physically and mentally. That's why the law sets a higher age for the purchase and consumption of alcohol.\n\n1\n\nLiu Can (died 318), courtesy name Shiguang, was an official of the state of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period. Liu Can was from the town of Youyu (游暎) in Wu (吳) County, Shu. At some point, he became an official under the warlord Sun Quan. He served as Minister of the Interior (司徒), Commandant of the Army (長軍), General of the Left (左將軍), and Administrator of Kuaiji Commandery (招記郡). In 281, Liu Can participated in the Battle of Changban against Cao Cao. In 300, he was made Minister of War (戰部). He died in 318.\n\n1\n\nColor quality scale (CQS) is a color rendering score – a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce colors of illuminated objects. Developed by researchers at NIST the metric aims to overcome some of the issues inherent in the widely used color rendering index (CIE Ra, 1974). The color space used in CIE Ra is outdated and nonuniform, and CQS uses CIELAB as a replacement. The Von Kries chromatic adaptation transform used by Ra does not perform as well as other available models. CQS uses CMCCAT2000. CIE Ra is based on desaturated samples, and a lamp's performance in rendering these samples fideliously is not necessarily linked to how it may perform with samples of higher saturation. CQS uses higher saturation samples. ‘Pure’ fidelity (where all deviations are considered bad) does not account for desired chromaticity changes. Increased saturation might be preferred. CQS does not penalise against increases in saturation. In CIE Ra the arithmetic mean is taken of the color differences for the individual samples. In CQS the individual results are combined through a root mean square instead, so that a small number of poorly rendered objects reflects with greater strength in the overall result. Negative values of CQS are made impossible due to their potential for consumer confusion. CCTs of lower than 2800K are penalised so that the CQS is more representative of their actual color rendering as opposed to their fidelity. The CQS generates the general index Qa. Several manufacturers are beginning to publish data on CQS scores of their products, including some who claim light sources with CQS scores up to 97.\n\n0\n\nLake Manatee is an artificial reservoir located in Bradenton, Florida. The reservoir was created in 1921 by the construction of the Bradenton Dam. It is approximately long and wide, with a surface area of . The reservoir serves as a water supply for the city of Bradenton and surrounding areas. Lake Manatee is one of only four artificial reservoirs in the state of Florida. It has been designated a National Wildlife Refuge for its significant populations of federally endangered manatees. The lake also supports a variety of fish and wildlife, including white-tailed deer, alligators, and egrets.\n\n1\n\nRaymond Leonard \"Ray\" Garthoff (born March 26, 1933) is a theoretical physicist who has made important contributions to the field of particle physics. He is currently a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, where he also serves as director of the university's Center for Particle and Nuclear Physics. Garthoff was born in 1933 in Chicago, Illinois. After completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, he received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1957. He spent the next two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University before joining the faculty at the University of Maryland in 1959. Garthoff has held this position ever since, serving as chairman of the physics department from 1984 to 1986 and director of the university's Center for Particle and Nuclear Physics from 1988 to 1995. Garthoff's research focuses on the fundamental particles and forces of nature. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of supersymmetry, quark confinement, dark matter, and the origin and evolution of stars. He has also made significant contributions to our understanding of quantum field theory and its applications to particle physics. Garthoff has received numerous awards and honors during his career, including the American Physical Society's Einstein Medal in 1992, the Dirac Medal in 1996, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n1\n\nWhitechapel is a district in East London, England. The name derives from the Anglo-Norman white chapel, meaning \"white church\", referring to the local parish church of St Anne, Whitechapel. Whitechapel is one of London's oldest districts, and has been known at various times for its tanneries, flint and steel industry, prostitution and poverty. The district has undergone a large gentrification process in recent years and now has a high concentration of luxury housing and businesses. Whitechapel is also considered to be one of the most dangerous areas in London. Today Whitechapel is a thriving district with a diverse population. Its attractions include the east London church of St Anne, Whitechapel, which features an intricately carved wooden pulpit and ornate stained glass windows; the excellent Whitechapel Gallery; historic pubs such as The Eagle and The George; the vibrant East End market; and the Bangladeshi community in Whitechapel Road.\n\n1\n\n\"How Low\" is a hip hop song by American rapper Ludacris.

The diamond was mined in Mina de la Pedra, Angola. The diamond was found on October 7, 2006, by a team of Australian and Angolan miners during a deep drilling program. The diamond was estimated to be worth $5 million. On October 9, 2006, it was announced that the diamond had been purchased by an unknown purchaser for an undisclosed amount. The diamond is approximately .50 carat (12.7 milligrams) and has a cut grade of D (1).\n\n1\n\nTamil literature has a rich and long literary tradition spanning more than two thousand years. The oldest extant works show signs of maturity indicating an even longer period of evolution. Contributors to the Tamil literature are mainly from Tamil people from South India, including the land now comprising Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Sri Lankan Tamils from Sri Lanka, as well as the Tamil diaspora. The history of Tamil literature follows the history of Tamil Nadu, closely following the social, economical, political and cultural trends of various periods. The early Sangam literature, dated before 300 BCE, contain anthologies of various poets dealing with many aspects of life, including love, war, social values and religion. This was followed by the early epics and moral literature, authored by Shaivite Vaishnavite Jain and Buddhist authors and poets lasting up to the 5th century CE. From the 6th to 12th century CE, the Tamil devotional poems written by Nayanmars (sages of Shaivism) and Alvars (sages of Vaishnavism), heralded the great Bhakti movement which later engulfed the entire Indian subcontinent. It is during this era that some of the grandest of Tamil literary classics like Kambaramayanam and Periya Puranam were authored and many poets were patronized by the imperial Chola and Pandya empires. The later medieval period saw many assorted minor literary works and also contributions by a few Muslim and European authors.\n\n0\n\nThe Gouina Hydroelectric Plant is a run-of-the-river-type hydroelectric power plant located on the Gouina River in the commune of Gouina, near Thiès, Senegal. It has an installed capacity of 248 MW and was commissioned in 1985.\n\n1\n\nThe Council of Ephesus was a council of Christian bishops convened in Ephesus (near present-day Selçuk in Turkey) in AD 431 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius II. This third ecumenical council, an effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, confirmed the original Nicene Creed, and condemned the teachings of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who held that the Virgin Mary may be called the Christotokos, \"Christ-bearer\" but not the Theotokos, \"God-bearer\". It met in June and July 431 at the Church of Mary in Ephesus in Anatolia. Background Nestorius' doctrine, Nestorianism, which emphasized the distinction between Christ's human and divine natures and argued that Mary should be called Christotokos (Christ-bearer) but not Theotokos (God-bearer), had brought him into conflict with other church leaders, most notably Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria. Nestorius himself had requested the Emperor to convene the council, hoping that it would prove his orthodoxy; the council in fact condemned his teachings as heresy. The council declared Mary as Theotokos (Mother of God).\n\n0\n\nBengali novels occupy a major part of the Bengali literary canon. They are usually classified into two categories- the \"classic\" and the \"modern\" Bengali novels. The classic Bengali novels were written in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and deal with everyday life in rural Bengal. The modern Bengali novels, which began to be written in the late 1960s and 1970s, are more introspective and often explore the issues of identity and social change.\n\n1\n\nDirty Money was a musical duo consisting of American rapper Jay Z and American singer-songwriter Beyoncé. The duo formed in 2003, and released their self-titled debut album the following year. They achieved mainstream success with the singles \"Runnin'\", \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\", and \"In My Lifetime\". The album was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Dirty Money's second album, The Blueprint 3, was released in 2009 and featured the number one single \"Empire State of Mind\". The duo divorced in 2013.\n\n1\n\nAnderson Troop was an independent cavalry company that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It had an authorized strength of 110 officers and men, and served for 18 months at the headquarters of Generals Don Carlos Buell and William S. Rosecrans, commanders of the Department and Army of the Ohio and Cumberland. The unit was frequently referred to as \"Anderson Troop, Pennsylvania Cavalry\", and while occasionally identified as the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry because its officers raised and organized that regiment, it was never a part. Service The Anderson Troop was organized at Carlisle, Pennsylvania in October-November 1861 and mustered in on November 30, 1861 under the command of Captain William Jackson Palmer of Philadelphia, its organizer. The company was raised for headquarters and escort duty with Gen.

Lamborn) (1877 – 4 March 1959) was a British physician and medical entomologist who worked in Southeast Asia and Africa, conducting studies on malaria and trypanosoma while also collecting and studying insects. A number of insect species including Alaena lamborni, Aslauga lamborni, Sphecodemyia lamborni, Praestochrysis lamborni; and the ciliate genus Lambornella are named after him. Lamborn was born in 1877 at Battle, Sussex and was educated at St Mungo's College, Glasgow, and trained at Middlesex Hospital receiving a medical degree in 1899. He worked at Islington Infirmary and the County Asylum, Oxford as a medical officer before going to British Guiana in 1905. In 1907 he moved to Pietermaritzburg in South Africa and later served in the Nigeria Bitumen Corporation at Lagos as a medical officer. He conducted a malaria survey in the Federated Malay States. In 1913 he was appointed as a medical entomologist in Nigeria but travelled around Africa working for the Imperial Bureau of Entomology. He was involved in studies of tsetse flies around 1917 and worked at Tanga Hospital. In 1918 he became a medical officer in Nyasaland and worked briefly in the Federated Malay States as a medical entomologist in 1920 before returning to Nyasaland. During World War II he served as a Major in Kenya in the R.A.M.C.\n\n0\n\nExtreme politics usually gain loads of support during times of economic difficulties. Take the NSDAP as an example. After WWI, Germany's economy was in ruins. The German Papiermark was absolutely worthless, with bills going into billions and trillions of Marks. This is something called [hyperinflation] (URL_0). The money was so worthless, that 4.2 trillion Marks was equal to 1USD in December 1923. The money was being used as wallpaper too. When people are hungry, cold, uneducated, and poor, they want a solution no matter the cost. That's when Hitler and his National Socialist German Workers Party comes into play. At the time, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Nazi Party were both promising a better future, but the Nazi Party garnered more support and won the German federal election in 1933. Before the election, the Reichstag fire started and Hitler used that to pass the Enabling act, allowing a ban on all opposition parties, meaning he will win all elections because his party was the only legal party. Hitler used the Jews and communists as a reason as why Germany was in shambles and that gave him the support he needed to take over. In addition to the stuff being said, the EU has a pretty bad image, because if there is a EU directive that s good the national politicians will be like \"we did that for you\" (because after the directive is issued it has to be made into national law), and if there is one that is unpopular they will be like \"that evil EU is forcing us\" though it might well be that the law (eg. Surveillance) is _ much _ harsher than what would be required by the directive. Also there is a perceived immigration problem and Islamophoby caused by perceived terrorist threat (I call bullshit on that btw) which plays right into the arms of those groups. People bother to join ideological parties when they are convinced the current system will not work and they are unhappy with their own lives because of that system. This usually happens when the government is big and the standard of living has gone down. If the government is in your face all the time and you lose your job, then you might blame the government and join a group. Europe has this in spades. Unemployment everywhere is up as Europe fails to grow and Brussels is bigger than ever.\n\n0\n\nIn the medical field of immunology, nanoCLAMP (CLostridal Antibody Mimetic Proteins) affinity reagents are recombinant 15 kD antibody mimetic proteins selected for tight, selective and gently reversible binding to target molecules. The nanoCLAMP scaffold is based on an IgG-like, thermostable carbohydrate binding module family 32 (CBM32) from a Clostridium perfringens hyaluronidase (Mu toxin). The shape of nanoCLAMPs approximates a cylinder of approximately 4 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, roughly the same size as a nanobody . nanoCLAMPs to specific targets are generated by varying the amino acid sequences and sometimes the length of three solvent exposed, adjacent loops that connect the beta strands making up the beta-sandwich fold, conferring binding affinity and specificity for the target. Properties nanoCLAMPs are the first antibody mimetics described to be polyol-responsive, meaning they release their targets upon exposure to a non-chaotropic salt and a polyol, such as propylene glycol. This property has been shown to be useful for purifying functional proteins and protein complexes by affinity purification. nanoCLAMPs are easily produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli, with typical yields in the range of 50 to 300 mg/L culture. Because nanoCLAMPs are devoid of cysteines, an engineered C-terminal cysteine can be used for site-directed conjugation of entities like fluorophores or resins using thiol-chemistry.\n\n0\n\nThe Aldersbrook Estate is the name given to an Edwardian housing estate in Wanstead North-East London in the area of the same name. The estate is bounded by Aldersbrook Road to the south, Bush Wood to the west, Wanstead Park to the north, and the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium to the east. It is wholly in the London Borough of Redbridge, and borders Waltham Forest and Newham. One half of Aldersbrook is in the postcode district of E11, the other in E12. Some of the part in E12 was formerly part of Newham. The built-up area is surrounded on all sides by open space or parkland, which is distinctive in the otherwise dense urban landscape of North-East London. Northumberland Avenue and Aldersbrook Road, in particular, have housing frontage built only on one side of the road, affording views of Wanstead Park and Wanstead Flats, respectively, to the properties there. Perhaps reflecting the generally pro-temperance Edwardian era in which the estate was laid out, or perhaps due to restrictive covenant, there are no public houses at all in the area, save for the bar of the Courtney Hotel, which is at the extreme south-eastern corner of the area. There is also a bowls club that has a small bar in it, located on Aldersbrook road.\n\n0\n\nThe Arditti Quartet is a string quartet founded by violinist Andre Rieu in 1989.

It is important to pay close attention to your son's symptoms and to seek medical attention if you have any concerns. In the meantime, you can try the following remedies to help alleviate your son's pain: Encourage your son to rest and avoid activities that may cause further injury. Apply a cold pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours to help reduce swelling and inflammation. Give your son acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) as directed on the package for pain relief. Have your son drink plenty of fluids, such as water and electrolyte-rich beverages, to help prevent dehydration. If your son's pain persists or worsens, or if he experiences any other concerning symptoms, such as vomiting or difficulty breathing, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible.

The area is bounded to the west by the cliff edge, in the east by County Road 149, and in the south by the town of Visby. Galgberget is named after the still remaining gallows, built during the 13th century, where local criminals used to be executed. It is claimed to be the only preserved Medieval execution site in Europe. The gallows consist of a low, circular stone wall with three pillars of stone rising from it. Wooden beams rested on the pillars, and criminals were hung from these using ropes and hooks. It is believed that the gallows were in use until 1845. The gallows were situated so that there was a clear view of them in Visby and from the sea, so that everyone could view those who had been executed. In July 2008, archaeologists from the Gotland Museum found the bones of some 30 people who had been executed, presumably on the spot, in an achaeological trench inside the stone circle of the gallows.\n\n0\n\nRuth Archer (also Pritchard) is a fictional character from the British television series Midsomer Murders, portrayed by Caroline Quentin.

The difference is that instead of forcing (extruding) a stick of glue through a heated nozzle, you are extruding plastic filament. Imagine you could make layers of glue with a hot glue gun just by putting one layer down, allowing it to dry and then putting another layer on top of the previous layer. 3D printing is the same thing, but the motors allow the material to be placed very precisely using very thin layers. Watching a time lapse video of something printing makes it much easier to understand: URL_0 There are other 3D printing technologies that use lasers, adhesives, powders, polymers, etc., and allow a variety of materials to be printed (metal/wood/etc), but plastic extrusion (fused filament fabrication) is the easiest to understand. Imagine a 2D Printer (Ink on paper), Now imagine it doing that hundreds of times going up one layer at a time. But instead of printing Ink on paper it can either melt the plastic underneath it, or print a thin strand of ABS plastic. The implications of printing guns is that the serial numbers that normal gun manufacturers print on the guns and register into the system doesn't need to be done via the printing company doing the gun because it is just an agreement with Police/Government and the gun Company. So there is the fact that you can have untraceable guns and also the fact that you can do it at home, buy a few rounds and then shoot wherever and the police would only know you bought rounds. Many implications but those are the first few. 3D printing means \"printing\" objects. You feed a schematic into a printer and out comes an object. The implication is that people can download and manufacture objects from home. You know that ad \"you wouldn't download a car\"? With 3D printing, one day you could do this. The video you saw is a gun someone designed to be manufactued by commercial 3D printers. You can download the schematics, feed it into your 3D printer and get a gun.\n\n0\n\nKenny Kosek, born in 1949 in The Bronx, New York, is an American sculptor.

It is usually caused by frustration or anger when something is not working as expected. In the past, people may have hit electronics in an attempt to fix them, but this is not a reliable or effective way to solve problems. In most cases, hitting electronics will only cause more damage and make the problem worse. If an electronic device is not working properly, it is usually a better idea to try to troubleshoot the problem or seek the help of a professional.\n\n1\n\nShane Ramsay is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Dean Geyer.

It is considered one of the most important and influential works of German literature. The Blood Rose tells the story of Prince Siegfried, who is in love with the beautiful but cursed princess Kriemhild. When Kriemhild is kidnapped by her uncle, King Gunther, Siegfried sets out to rescue her. He joins forces with a band of outlaws and travels through Germany to find his love. Along the way, he faces many challenges, including battles with monsters and outlaws, and eventually comes to understand Kriemhild's tragic story.

In the case of languages like Mandarin, there is a convention which is followed when transliterating names. However, the languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet aren't the only ones which usually garner phonetic transliterations. I read and write Hindi ; the Latin-script derivations of Hindi are usually phonetic when read aloud by a somewhat knowledgeable English speaker. While I'm not familiar with Mandarin, I would guess that in some cases, transliterations don't always follow English conventions due to the presence of sounds or sound combinations which we don't have in our language. For instance, in Arabic, there is are multiple letters which approximate the \"th\" sound. In one form of Chinese transliteration, it was decided to use two unimportant Latin letters (Q and X) to represent totally unrelated sounds in Mandarin (maybe Cantonese also, I'm not sure). I guess in most transliteration systems, combinations of two letters were used instead to minimize confusion by English speakers, but single letters were used here for orthographic simplicity. To me it just seems slightly less English centric, as X has an'sh'sound in some other languages (some dialects of Portuguese and Spanish I believe, perhaps among others), so it's not totally arbitrary. I can't think of any other languages like this. Do you have any more examples? I've had a few weeks of Mandarin lessons, and even the transliteration you mentioned isn't quite accurate. The sound represented by \"xi\" isn't quite \"she.\" It's halfway between an English \"sh\" and \"s.\" And lots of Latin-alphabet languages have sounds that aren't mutual to one another. Certain Spanish dialects pronounce the \"b\" almost, but not quite, like an English \"v,\" and none of the German vowels with umlauts have an English equivalent. In short, the premise of your question is flawed. It's not just languages with Cyrillic alphabets that don't have equivalents in Latin alphabets.\n\n0\n\nFar-Fetched Facts is a book by German historian Timothy Snyder about the history of propaganda and its effects.

Subjective is saying that it's cold out. Objective is saying that the temperature is 20F. The difference matters because one focuses on the individual's perceptions, while the other focuses on things that can be measured and quantified. They are antonyms. Subjective information that is-by definition-based on personal opinion and feelings. Objective information is information that is not based on personal feelings. 1. Objective-the sky is blue 2. Subjective-the sky is beautiful It is NOT about factuality or accuracy. Objective information can be wrong ... it's just not wrong because of personal perspective or feeling.\n\n0\n\nThe Crazymen or Crazymen is a punk metal, instrumental band that started 2001 in Motala, Sweden by Damir Bodnar (alias Mr. Tiger) and Oscar Nilsson (alias Mr. Lightning).

The construction took place in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The religious community reached its apogee in the 13th century and then, after a long decline over the following centuries, disappeared in the 1780s.\n\n0\n\nNicholas Albert Reale (March 20, 1922 – November 18, 1984) was a prominent American watercolorist with a lengthy career in art and teaching.

It is important to respect the sovereignty and privacy of other countries and to follow international laws and norms when it comes to matters of espionage and intelligence gathering. If it were found that the United States was spying on European countries without their knowledge or consent, it is likely that there would be a strong international backlash and efforts to address the issue through diplomatic channels. It is important for all countries to work together to build trust and cooperation, rather than engaging in activities that could damage relations and undermine mutual understanding.\n\n1\n\nPure Prairie League is an American country music band formed in 1986 in Lincoln, Nebraska.

It tells the story of four African American women. Each of the four characters represents an African-American stereotype in society. Thulani Davis of The Village Voice called the song \"an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become.\" African-American female archetypes The first of the four women described in the song is \"Aunt Sarah\" a character who represents African-American enslavement. Simone's description of the woman emphasizes the strong and resilient aspects of her race, \"strong enough to take the pain\" as well as the long-term suffering her race has had to endure, \"inflicted again and again\". The second woman who appears in the song is dubbed \"Saffronia\", a woman of mixed race (\"my skin is yellow\") forced to live \"between two worlds\". She is portrayed as an oppressed woman and her story is once again used to highlight the suffering of the black race at the hands of white people in positions of power (\"My father was rich and white/He forced my mother late one night\"). The third woman is that of a prostitute referred to as \"Sweet Thing\". She finds acceptance with both black and white people, not only because \"my hair is fine\", but also because she provides sexual gratification (\"Whose little girl am I?/Anyone who has money to buy\"). The fourth and final woman is very tough, embittered by the generations of oppression and suffering endured by her people (\"I'm awfully bitter these days/'cause my parents were slaves\"). Simone finally unveils the woman's name after a dramatic finale during which she screams, \"My name is Peaches!\"\n\n0\n\nThe Red Strings (also Heroes of America) were a group active primarily in the Southern United States during the American Civil War.
