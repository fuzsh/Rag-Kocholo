        "text": "The Grand Duchy of Courland is a country located North of the Kingdom of Lithuania and South of the Republic of Latvia. Courland is the homeland of the Baltic German people who were displaced long ago by the Soviets at the start of the Cold War. The restoration of Courland's monarchy had helped establish a new country for the Baltic German people who were an ethnic minority in their homelands in the Baltics.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCreation of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia[]\n\nIn 1561, during the Livonian Wars, the Livonian Confederation was dismantled and the Livonian Order, an order of German knights, was disbanded. On the basis of the Treaty of Vilnius, the southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Ducatus Ultradunensis (Pārdaugavas hercogiste). The part of Latvia between the west bank of the Daugava River and the Baltic Sea became the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. It was ruled by the dukes from the House of Kettler with the exception of Ernst Johann Biron and his son Peter von Biron\n\nGotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Livonian Order, became the first duke of Courland. Other members of the Order became the Couronian nobility, with the fiefdoms they had hitherto held becoming their estates. In all, Kettler received nearly one-third of the land in the new duchy. Mitau (Jelgava) was designated as the new capital and a Diet was to meet there twice a year.\n\nSeveral parts of the Courish area did not belong to the Duchy. The Order of Livonia had already loaned the Grobiņa district (on the coast of Baltic Sea) to the Duke of Prussia. Another district, the Bishopric of Piltene, also called the \"Bishopric of Courland\" (on the Venta River in western Courland), belonged to Magnus, son of the king of Denmark. He promised to transfer it to the Duchy of Courland after his death, but this plan failed and only later did Wilhelm Kettler regain this district.\n\nLike the other members of the Order, Kettler was German and set about establishing the Duchy along the lines of similar German states. In 1570, he issued the Privilegium Gotthardinum, which allowed the landholders to enserf the native peasantry on their lands.\n\nWhen Gotthard Kettler died in 1587, his sons, Friedrich and Wilhelm, became the dukes of Courland. They divided the Duchy into two parts in 1596. Friedrich controlled the eastern part, Semigalia (Zemgale), with his residence in Mitau (Jelgava). Wilhelm owned the western part, Courland (Kurzeme), with his residence in Goldingen (Kuldīga). Wilhelm regained the Grobiņa district when he married the daughter of the Duke of Prussia. He also paid out and regained control over the Piltene district, but eventually, it fell to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he developed metalworking and shipyards, and the new ships delivered the goods of Courland to other countries.\n\nHowever, relations between the duke and the landowners were quite hostile. In addition, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was the overlord of the Duchy of Courland, supported the landowners. Wilhelm expressed his disappointment with the landowners, but this ended with his removal from the duke's seat in 1616. Finally, Wilhelm left Courland and spent the rest of his life abroad. Thus, Friedrich became the only duke of Courland after 1616.\n\nFrom 1600 to 1629, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden conducted a war with its main battlefields around Riga. As a result, Sweden gained control of what is today central and northern Latvia, which became Swedish Livonia. The Commonwealth retained the eastern part of the Duchy of Livonia, thereafter called Inflanty Voivodeship in Polish. Courland was also involved in this war, but did not suffer severe damage.\n\nUnder the next duke, Jacob Kettler, the Duchy reached the peak of its prosperity. During his travels in Western Europe, Jacob became the eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and shipbuilding became much more developed, and powder mills began producing gunpowder. Trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. Jacob established the merchant fleet of the Duchy of Courland, with its main harbours in Ventspils and Libau.\n\nAttempts to create Colonial Empire[]\n\nIn 1651 the Duchy established its first colony in Africa, St. Andrews Island at the Gambia River and founded Jacob Fort there. The main export goods included ivory, gold, furs and spices. Soon afterwards, in 1652, Courlanders established another colony, in Tobago in the West Indies. There the main export goods included sugar, tobacco, coffee and spices.\n\nHowever, during this time, the Duchy of Courland remained an object of interest for both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1655 the Swedish army entered the territory of the Duchy, starting the Swedish–Polish war (1655–60). The Swedish army captured Duke Jacob (1658–60). During this period, the Dutch took over both of Courland's colonies that lacked supplies and manpower, and the merchant fleet and factories suffered destruction. This war ended with the peace Treaty of Oliwa (1660). Courland regained Tobago on the basis of the treaty and held it until 1689. Duke Jacob set about restoring the fleet and factories, but the Duchy of Courland never again reached its pre-war level of prosperity.\n\n18th Century[]\n\nWhen Jacob died in 1682, his son, Friedrich Casimir, became the next duke. During his reign production continued to decrease. The duke himself was more interested in glamorous celebrations and spent more money than he had. This forced him to sell Tobago to the British. During this period, the Commonwealth increased its influence in the political and economic life of the Duchy. Additionally, Russia showed an interest in this area.\n\nFriedrich Casimir died in 1698. His successor, Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler, was only six years old and was under the regency of his uncle Ferdinand — a Polish general. During this time the Great Northern War (1700–21) began between Sweden and Russia with its allies — the Commonwealth, Saxony and Denmark. As a result of the war, Russia took control of Swedish Livonia starting in 1710. In Courland, Russia also had such a strong influence that its ambassador, Pyotr Bestuzhev, became the most powerful man in the duchy. The Tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, received a promise from Friedrich Wilhelm that he would marry one of the daughters of the tsar's brother. By having this promise, Peter the Great wished to increase the influence of Russia in Courland. In 1710, Friedrich Wilhelm married Anna Ioannovna (later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from St Petersburg, he took ill and died. Anne ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730.\n\nAfter the death of Friedrich Wilhelm, the next candidate for the seat of duke was Ferdinand Kettler, who, at the time, lived in Danzig. Because the law required the duke to reside within the Duchy, the Diet did not recognize him. Because Ferdinand was the last representative of Kettler's family, a remarkable number of candidates tried to gain the dukedom during this period. One favorite was Maurice de Saxe, natural son of Frederick Augustus I the Strong, king of Poland. Saxe had managed to gain support and was even mentioned as marrying Anna Ioannovna, Duchess of Courland at that time. He was elected duke in 1726, but only managed to maintain himself by force of arms till the next year. Russia disliked him and sent an army to western Courland to destroy Maurice's base. When Catherine was Empress Peter Lacy was given responsibility for removing Maurice de Saxe from Courland. As the result Maurice de Saxe had to leave Courland, and Russia increased its influence. This was achieved in good measure due to service of Peter Lacy who was governor of Livonia from 1727 until his death in 1751. Russian influence increased further when Frederick August III, the Elector of Saxony, in his successful bid to succeed his father on the Polish throne in the 1730s, agreed to grant Anna of Russia her choice of successor to the Courish duchy in exchange for Russian support in the War of the Polish Succession. (Because of the duchy's position as a vassal of the Commonwealth and Ferdinand Kettler's lack of issue, the duchy would otherwise formally have devolved onto the Polish throne.) Anna appointed Ernst Johann von Biron duke of Courland in 1737.\n\nVon Biron received remarkable financial support from Russia and invested it in construction - for example, the castle of Schloss Ruhenthal projected by the distinguished Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Anna Ivanovna died in 1740, resulting in von Biron's exile to Siberia the following year. From there, through the Council of the Duke, he continued to control the Duchy, with the agreement of the king of Poland. However, the landowners of Courland disliked the agreement and even refused to follow the regulations of the Council of the Duke.\n\nDuke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg was selected as Biron's successor on 27 June 1741 with the support of his cousin Maria Theresa of Austria, but while he was in St Petersburg to get this title ratified, Elizabeth of Russia carried out a coup on 6 December 1741 and he lost the title.\n\nKing Augustus III of Poland proclaimed his son, Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, the next Duke. Thus, the Duchy of Courland had two dukes simultaneously thereafter. The situation became extremely tense — one part of the landowners accepted von Biron, the other, Carl of Saxony. The Empress Catherine II of Russia (reigned 1762–96) solved this situation by recalling Ernst von Biron from exile in 1763. By doing this, she avoided the possible increase of influence of the Commonwealth in Courland. However, political fighting had exhausted Ernst Biron, and he turned the seat of duke over to his son, Peter von Biron, in 1769. But political tumult continued in Courland. Some landowners supported the Commonwealth, some Russia. Ultimately, Russia determined the further fate of Courland when with its allies it began the third division of Poland (1795). Given a \"nice recommendation\" by Russia, Duke Peter von Biron gave up his rights to Russia in 1795. With the signing of the final document on March 28, 1795, the Duchy of Courland was incorporated into the Russian state and title of Duke of Courland was added to the title of Russian emperors.\n\nEra of Courland Governate[]\n\nDuchy of Courland and Semigallia was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the province of Courland with its capital at Mitau (now Jelgava), following the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Until the late 19th century the governorate was not ruled by Russia but was administered independently by the local Baltic German nobility through a feudal Regional Council (German: Landtag).\n\nThe governorate was bounded in the north by the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Riga and the Governorate of Livonia; west by the Baltic Sea; south by the Vilna Governorate and Prussia and east by the Vitebsk Governorate and Minsk Governorate. The population in 1846 was estimated at 553,300. It ceased to exist during World War I after the German Empire took control of the region in 1918. Russia surrendered the territory by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918.\n\nAttempted Restoration of the Duchy[]\n\nDuring World War I, the German Army had occupied the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire by the autumn of 1915. A front was established along a line stretched between Riga, Daugavpils and Baranovitch.\n\nThe Latvian Provisional National Council was proclaimed on 16 November 1917. On 30 November, the Latvian Provisional National Council proclaimed an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formal, independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, German troops started advancing from Courland, and by the end of February 1918 the territories of the former Russian Governorate of Livonia and Autonomous Governorate of Estonia that had declared independence were also occupied and fell under the German military administration. With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918 Bolshevist Russia accepted the loss of the Courland Governorate and by agreements concluded in Berlin on 27 August 1918 the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia and the Governorate of Livonia were severed from Russia.\n\nAs a parallel political movement under the German military administration, Baltic Germans began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by one such Landesrat composed of Baltic Germans, who offered the crown of the Duchy to Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nIn October 1918, the Chancellor of Germany Prince Maximilian of Baden proposed to have the military administration in the Baltic replaced by civilian authority. The new policy was stated in a telegram from the German Foreign Office to the military administration of the Baltic: The government of the Reich is unanimous in respect of the fundamental change in our policy towards the Baltic countries, namely that in the first instance policy is to be made with the Baltic peoples.\n\nOn 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence. On 7 December 1918, the German Military handed over authority to the Latvian national government headed by Kārlis Ulmanis.\n\nEra before the creation of the Second Duchy[]\n\nAfter World War I, Courland became one of five provinces of the newly formed nation of Latvia. These provinces corresponded to Latvia's four traditional regions plus Riga. In 1935, Courland had an area of 13,210 square kilometres (5,099 sq mi) and a population of 292,659 making it the least populous of the provinces. The Soviet Army occupied Latvia in conformity with the terms of 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 17 June 1940. On 5 August 1940, the Soviet Union annexed the region along with the rest of Latvia which was made a constituent republic of the USSR, the Latvian SSR.\n\nAt the start of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941, the German Wehrmacht's Army Group North headed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb overran Courland, along with the rest of the Baltic littoral. In 1944 the Red Army lifted the siege of Leningrad and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of Ukraine and Belarus. However, some 200,000 German troops held out in Courland. With their backs to the Baltic Sea, they remained trapped in what became known as the Courland Pocket, blockaded by the Red Army and by the Red Baltic Fleet. Colonel-General Heinz Guderian, the Chief of the German General Staff, pleaded with Adolf Hitler to allow evacuation of the troops in Courland by sea for use in the defense of Germany. Hitler refused and ordered the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Courland to continue the defense of the area. Germanies naval capacity to evacuate these forces was restricted as it needed the majority of its transport ships to evacuate troops from East Prussia and maintain vital trade with Sweden. . On January 15, 1945, Army Group Courland (Heeresgruppe Kurland) formed under Colonel-General Dr. Lothar Rendulic. The blockade by elements of the Leningrad Front remained until May 8, 1945, when Army Group Courland, then under its last commander, Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, surrendered to Marshal Leonid Govorov, the commander of the Leningrad Front (reinforced by elements of the 2nd Baltic Front) on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group consisted of the remnants of some 31 divisions. After May 9, 1945, approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began to be moved to Soviet prison camps to the east. The majority of them never returned to Germany. Courland remained part of the Latvian SSR within the Soviet Union following World War II. Courland was no longer an administrative unit under the Soviets but an early Liepāja Oblast, one of three oblasts in Latvia, roughly corresponded to Courland.\n\nRestoration[]\n\nThe German Empire and it's allies in Europe restored Courland back as a sovereign state, Ernst-Johann von Biron, Prince of Courland became the Grand Duke of Courland since he was the head of the Royal House of Biron. The Republic of Latvia was pissed over the fact that they had lost territory to the German Empire and this resulted in a bitter rivalry with the Baltic German Homeland and multiple border conflicts between Courland and Lativia. Courland tried to make peace multiple times with Latvia but Latvia constantly refused many peace offers because they will not stop until Courland is conquered so they can create the Latvian Nation they once were before Soviet annexation. However due to Courland and it's allies having an advantage, Latvia never won the wars and constantly continued to fight wars despite the fact Courland had won multiple times due to it being backed by very strong allies.\n\nSadly Latvia was conquered by the Russian Federation as a puppet state and Russia forced it to wage war against Courland and it's allies. Luckily for Courland, Finland and Estonia threatened the Russians by threatening to bombard Leningrad and burn it to the ground if the Russians continued to wage war against Courland and it's allies. The Russians then surrendered as they had to deal with another army of angry protesters rioting in the capital. Courland is lucky that it survived with many allies at it's side, but it must do it's part in helping them defend Courland itself against the Russians because after they lost Siberia to China, Russia might desire to conquer all of Europe under the banner of the Russian flag and Courland will fall with them which could spell doom for the Courlander population as their homeland will loose it sovereignty once again.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nCourland is a Semi-Constitutional Monarchy that is ruled by a Grand Duke who has the power to allow or veto any laws that are passed by the Royal Diet. The Supreme Leader of the Royal Diet is the Prime Minister who has power over the government and enforces the will of the Grand Duke as his top official. The Royal Diet consists of the Baltic Knighthoods of Courland and Semgalia which hold a registry of all noble families which belong to the Knighthoods, generally no more than a few hundred of them, it has a legal code and a series of regulations for all members to follow, and it has an autonomous government which deliberates on internal matters of the Knighthood without any interference from the central government. Each Knighthood has an internal assembly (Rittertag) which elects various officials and appoints numerous honorary offices for the nobles, as well as the Knighthood Captain (Ritterschaftshauptmann), the top official in the Knighthood. Their main political role is forming Land Colleges (Landratskollegium), partially legislative, partially executive institutions which are formed in each Canton as well as on a nationwide level. A Land College is a council of 12 noble representatives which fulfills a hybrid role of an upper house and an executive authority.\n\nOrder of Succession[]\n\nThe Order of Succession is Saliac in which the Grand Duke's heirs are his sons, paternal grandsons, brothers, nephews, grandnephews, paternal uncles or male paternal cousins. Females are not allowed to be heirs to the throne and if the Grand Duke dies, his daughters will no longer be part of the royal family and become nobility. If the Biron family were to ever go extinct, then the male descendants of Prince Friedrich of Saxe-Meiningen (the royal house of Shwarze Schwarze) will take the throne of Courland. This is due to Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, Duke of Courland and Semigallia ruling Courland in the 1700s and the fact Gustav von Biron and his wife Adelheid Greite's daughter born in 1970, Alexandra had married Daniel Simeon Schwarze Schwarze, a morgantic descendant of Prince Friedrich of Saxe-Meiningen and the fact that the marriage was the first marriage between a female member of the Biron Family to produce male issue. Prince Gustav von Biron has adopted the male issue of Alexandra as his heirs to transition the ruling house with ease if he died as Duke of Courland.\n\nKarl von Bühren ∞ Catharina Hedwig von Raab genannt Thülen (1660-1740)\n\nErnst Johann von Biron (1690–1772), duke of Courland and Semigallia, lord of Sycow ∞ Benigna Gottliebe von Trotta genannt Treyden (1703-1782)\n\nPeter von Biron (1724–1800), duke of Courland and Semigallia, duke of Sagan, lord of Sycow ∞ Princess Caroline of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1748-1782) ∞ Princess Eudoxia Yusupova (1743-1780) ∞ Countess Dorothea Anna Charlotte von Medem (1761-1821)\n\nWilhelmine von Biron (1781–1839), princess of Courland, duchess of Sagan ∞ Prince Louis de Rohan-Guémenée (1768-1836) ∞ Prince Vasily Troubetskoy (1776-1841) ∞ Count Karl Rudolf von der Schulenburg (1788-1856)\n\nMarie Luisa Paulina von Biron (1782–1845), princess of Courland, duchess of Sagan ∞ Friedrich Hermann Otto, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1776-1838)\n\nJohanna Katharina von Biron (1783–1876), princess of Courland ∞ Prince Francesco Pignatelli, Duke of Acerenza (1766-1840)\n\nKarl Ernst von Biron (1728–1801), prince of Courland ∞ Apollonia Lodzia-Poninska (1760-1800)\n\nGustav Kalixt von Biron (1780–1821) ∞ Countess Franziska von Maltzahn (1790-1849)\n\nKarl Prinz Biron von Curland (1811–1848) ∞ Countess Agnes zur Lippe-Biesterfeld (1810-1884)\n\nKalixt von Biron (1817–1882) ∞ Princess Elena Meshchersky (1820-1905)\n\nGustav von Biron (1859–1941) ∞ Princess Adele zu Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg (1866-1890) ∞ Francoise Levisse de Montigny de Jaucourt (1874-1957)\n\nKarl von Biron (1907–1982) ∞ Princess Herzeleide of Prussia (1918–1989)\n\nVictoria Benigna von Biron (*1939) ∞ Baron Johann von Twickel (b. 1940)\n\nErnst-Johann von Biron II, Grand Duke of Courland (b. 1940) ∞ Countess Elisabeth of Isenburg-Philippseich, Grand Duchess of Courland (b. 1941)\n\n(1) Michael von Biron, Crown Prince of Courland (b. 1944) ∞ Kristin von Oertzen, Crown Princess of Courland (b. 1944)\n\nPrincess Veronika von Biron (b. 1970) ∞ Prince Christoph Carl\n\n(2) Prince Alexander von Biron (b. 1972) ∞ Martina Hill (b. 1973)\n\n(3) Prince Alexander von Biron Jr. (b. 2000) ∞ Lily Laight (b. 2001)\n\n(4) Prince Michael von Biron II (b. 2002), married Emilia Jones (b. 2002)\n\nStefanie von Biron (b. 1975) ∞ Georg Güber\n\nFriedrich Franz von Biron (1910–1997) ∞ Countess Maria-Irmgard von Ballestrem (1908-1993)\n\n(5) Prince Franz Kalixt von Biron (b. 1934) ∞ Baroness Gustava von Brockdorff (b. 1939)\n\n(6) Prince Marcus von Biron (b. 1967) ∞ Laurence Treil (b. 1967)\n\n(7) Prince Karl von Biron (b. 1997) ∞ Elvira Herman (b. 1997)\n\n(8) Prince Ernst-Johann von Biron (b. 2021)\n\n(9) Prince Peter von Biron (b. 1998) ∞ Sina Maria Deinert (b. 1998)\n\n(10) Prince Marcus von Biron II (b. 2022)\n\nPrincess Alexandria von Biron (b. 1999), married Prince Adalbert of Prussia (b. 1999)\n\nPrince Stephan of Prussia (b. 2021)\n\nPrincess Kalixta (b. 1975) ∞ Christian Georg Fuchs\n\n(11) Prince Gustav von Biron (b. 1941) ∞ Adelheid Greite (b. 1943)\n\nPrincess Alexandra (b. 1970), married Daniel Simeon Schwarze Schwarze (b. 1965)\n\n(12) Prince Gustav Shwarze Schwarze (b. 1990), married Nicole Mieth (b. 1990)\n\n(13) Prince Karl Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2012)\n\n(14) Prince Peter Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2013)\n\n(15) Prince Ernst Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2014)\n\n(16) Prince Joseph Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2015)\n\n(17) Prince Johann Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2016)\n\n(18) Prince Georg Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2017)\n\n(19) Prince Augustus Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2018)\n\n(20) Prince Frederich Shwarze Schwarze (b. 2019)\n\n(21) Prince Daniel Alexander Schwarze Schwarze (b. 1997), married Kristīne Gaile (b. 1997)\n\n(22) Prince Alexander Schwarze Schwarze (b. 2020)\n\n(23) Prince Wilhelm Schwarze Schwarze (b. 2021)\n\n(24) Prince Gustav Karl Schwarze Schwarze Sr. (b. 1997), married Ieva Gaile (b. 1997)\n\n(25) Prince Gustav Karl Schwarze Schwarze Jr. (b. 2021)\n\n(26) Prince Peter Schwarze Schwarze (b. 1998), married Helena Kerschner (b. 1998)\n\n(27) Prince Peter Kerschner Schwarze Schwarze (b. 2021)\n\nPrincess Franziska von Biron, Crown Princess of Estonia (b. 1975), married Prince Heinrich, Crown Prince of Estonia (b. 1975)\n\nPrince Heinrich of Estonia (b. 1997), married Gideon Adlon (b. 1997)\n\nPrince Heinrich of Estonia (b. 2019)\n\nPrince Adolf of Estonia (b. 2020)\n\nPrince Frederick of Estonia (b. 2021)\n\nCabinet[]\n\nErnst-Johann von Biron -
