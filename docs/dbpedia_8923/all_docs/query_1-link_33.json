Bell and James Williams\n\nDespite A Thousand Plateaus being one of the first texts by Deleuze or Guattari to be translated into English, its reception as a philosophical text has largely been secondary to the uses it can be put to in other domains, and to the reception of Deleuze’s own sole-authored works, such as Difference and Repetition, with their more traditional structures and frequent connections with the history of philosophy. The aim of this volume is to explore the specifically philosophical vision of Deleuze and Guattari’s project. Despite the frequent assertions that the kernel of Deleuze and Guattari’s thought is to be found in Deleuze’s earlier project, even in their final collaboration they are insistent that the notion of the overcoming of philosophy is merely ‘tiresome, idle chatter’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 9). This book brings together fifteen leading scholars on the work of Deleuze and Guattari, each addressing one of the plateaus, focusing on an aspect of that plateau that connects to their own research interests. The result of this process is a volume that both serves as a guide to A Thousand Plateaus, but also provides detailed analysis of specific questions, concepts and relations throughout the different plateaus. In this introduction, I want to set out some of the reasons for taking A Thousand Plateaus as a philosophical text, beginning with how it seeks to fulfil a promise made in Difference and Repetition, before moving on to look at why this project requires a substantial revision of our ideas about the style and structure of a philosophical text.\n\nA Thousand Plateaus and philosophy There has been a tendency to dismiss the philosophical import of A Thousand Plateaus. Alain Badiou’s Deleuze: The Clamour of Being, for\n\n2 | a thousand pl ateaus a nd ph ilo s o ph y instance, contains hardly any references to Deleuze’s collaborations with Guattari, which are dismissed by Badiou as ‘the superficial doxa of an anarcho-desiring Deleuzianism’.1 The orthodox response to this dismissal has been to focus on Deleuze’s early single-authored works as the kernel of his philosophy, and to see the later work as moving away from traditional philosophical concerns. In 1968, twelve years before the publication of A Thousand Plateaus, Gilles Deleuze claimed in his first major work of independent philosophy, Difference and Repetition, that we needed not simply a new approach to philosophy, but also a new mode of philosophical expression. ‘The time is coming when it will hardly be possible to write a book of philosophy as it has been done for so long: “Ah! The old style . . .”’ (Deleuze 1994: xxi). Difference and Repetition sets out many of the philosophical themes that are at the heart of A Thousand Plateaus: a metaphysics of intensity, a critique of urdoxae and the concomitant move to a philosophy of the creation of concepts, and a thoroughgoing critique of representation. This earlier work presents these ideas in a style where the words resonate with each other on the page, at points seemingly departing the philosophical for the poetic.2 Despite the vibrant rhetorical style running throughout the work, digging a little deeper into Difference and Repetition reveals a structure very much like that of a traditional philosophical work, developing a sustained argument from initial claims about how we understand the concept of difference across a number of chapters into a novel account of how we must recognise and think the intensive nature of the world. It is because of this classical structure that Difference and Repetition is favoured for philosophical analysis. Despite a rejection of truth as the primary axis of evaluation of claims, it is nonetheless replete with arguments open to evaluation precisely along those lines. In a later series of interviews, however, Deleuze claims that this early work describes an exercise of thought, but notes that ‘describing it was not yet exercising thought in that way’ (Deleuze and Parnet 1987: 16). As such, while Difference and Repetition recognises the need to move away from traditional approaches to philosophising, it does not itself institute this movement. In an interview with Libération, Deleuze makes clear that A Thousand Plateaus is very much a philosophy project, and a philosophical system. In this interview, he answers the question, ‘what is philosophy?’ by claiming, ‘Everyone knows that philosophy deals with concepts. A system’s a set of concepts’ (Deleuze 1995a: 32). As Deleuze and Guattari note, there are two related aspects to this. There are several ways of conceiving both of a system and of a concept. We can develop a system of essences, which is the traditional model of philosophy. This is a closed system, and defines the traditional model of how philosophy operates. Alternatively, we can develop a notion of a philosophical system that is open. ‘It’s an open\n\ni ntroducti on | 3 system when the concepts relate to circumstances rather than essences’ (Deleuze 1995a: 32). I will return to this point when I come to the notion of a root-book in A Thousand Plateaus itself, but we can note that this distinction runs throughout Deleuze’s work, and is at the heart of Difference and Repetition, where Deleuze explicitly opposes Aristotle’s account of definition, which attempts to rigorously determine the essential nature of a thing (‘Socrates is rational’), excluding those features which are purely accidental (‘Socrates is sitting’), with his own account of determination through the Idea, which attempts to capture all of the dynamics at play in a system without distinguishing between the essential and inessential. ‘No doubt, if one insists, the word “essence” might be preserved, but only on condition of saying that the essence is precisely the accident, the event, the sense; not simply the contrary of what is ordinarily called the essence but the contrary of the contrary’ (Deleuze 1994: 191). This distinction is also at the heart of A Thousand Plateaus. In the rhizomatic structure of A Thousand Plateaus, ‘the concepts relate to circumstances rather than essences’. Similarly here, we find a move originally made in Difference and Repetition, where the question of essence, ‘What is x?’ is replaced with the questions, ‘How many?’, ‘How?’, ‘In which cases?’ (Deleuze 1994: 182). If a system is a set of concepts, then what is a concept? The key point to note is that philosophical concepts ‘don’t, first of all, turn up ready-made’ (Deleuze 1995a: 32). As Deleuze and Guattari note in What is Philosophy?, the project of philosophy has traditionally been misconceived as involving ‘contemplation, reflection, or communication’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 6). That is, philosophy has traditionally presupposed the concepts we use to engage with the world, whereas it is the constitution of these concepts that is the task and object of inquiry of philosophy itself. As they put it, ‘The first principle of philosophy is that Universals explain nothing but must themselves be explained’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 7). As such, Deleuze and Guattari do not abandon the role of concepts, but argue for a renewed focus on their genesis, attempting to develop a rigorous account of philosophical concept creation that would avoid replacing ‘critique with sales promotion’3 (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 10). In Difference and Repetition, the attempt to think how concepts are constituted revolves around an attempt to develop an account of how thinking operates before it is represented. Thus concepts are seen as constituted by the reflection of thinking on itself, which generates concepts while covering over their origin. Deleuze attempts to develop an account of a ‘thought without image’ (Deleuze 1994: 276) that would be the constitutive force behind our representation. Thus, the project of Difference and Repetition owes much to the Bergsonian project of reversing the natural direction of thought that leads from the process of thinking to its fixed\n\n4 | a thousand pl ateaus a nd ph ilo s o ph y forms. Difference and Repetition therefore takes up both the notion of an open system and that of a constituted character of concepts. Nonetheless, we can see why Deleuze later believes that it is only with Guattari that he moves from describing the activity of philosophy to actually doing philosophy. We can note that while Deleuze argues that the question, ‘What is x?’ is an illegitimate question deriving from a philosophy of essence, this form of question is at the heart of Difference and Repetition. As he ­concludes his introduction: We therefore find ourselves confronted by two questions: what is the concept of difference – one which is not reducible to simple conceptual difference but demands its own Idea, its own singularity at the level of Ideas? On the other hand, what is the essence of repetition – one which is not reducible to difference without concept, and cannot be confused with the apparent character of objects represented by the same concept, but bears witness to singularity as a power of Ideas? (Deleuze 1994: 27)\n\nAs Deleuze was later to write of this text, ‘for my part, when I was no longer content with the history of philosophy, my book Difference and Repetition still aspired nonetheless toward a sort of classical height and even toward an archaic depth. The theory of intensity which I was drafting was marked by depth, false or true; intensity was presented as stemming from the depths’ (Deleuze 2006: 65). This reliance on traditional categories comes through in Deleuze’s characterisation of the project as attempting to think ‘difference-in-itself’, which, mirroring Kant’s transcendental idealism, is itself characterised as ‘the closest noumenon’. In A Thousand Plateaus, this methodological reliance on traditional categories of philosophy such as essence is left behind. Deleuze writes of his first collaboration with Guattari that ‘no longer has height or depth, nor surface. In this book everything happens, is done, the intensities, the events, upon a sort of spherical body or scroll painting: The Organless Body’ (Deleuze 2006: 66), and the same claim could be made of A Thousand Plateaus itself. The central question of A Thousand Plateaus is not ‘What is?’, but ‘How does one make?’ This move to a loose pragmatism involves a different conception of what philosophy entails. Rather than the attempt to distinguish true and false depths – the project of distinguishing lineages of images that still holds to Plato’s model of philosophy just as a photographic negative maintains the detail of the image it inverts – Deleuze and Guattari joyously take up one of the central concepts of Difference and Repetition: the image of thought. In Difference and Repetition, the image of thought is the surface effect of the subrepresentational nature of thinking – a paralogism created by the reflection of thinking on itself that is at the heart of philosophy’s inability to think depth appropriately. In A Thousand\n\ni ntroducti on | 5 Plateaus, by contrast, the philosophical project does not involve the search for a moment prior to an image of thought, but the construction of a new image of thought – the ‘vegetal image of thought’ (Deleuze 1994: xvii). As such, it eschews the effort to seek the essence of the world in favour of a more pragmatic concern of developing a rigorous but different systematic way of relating elements together. Deleuze and Guattari met in 1969, when Deleuze was convalescing after the removal of a lung and Guattari was searching for a creative outlet that would allow him to give structure to his militant left-wing activities, work on psychoanalysis at the La Borde clinic and ideas around machines, political and social structures, capitalism and schizophrenia (Dosse 2010: 3). These latter themes bring new directions and different concepts to the philosophy developed in Difference and Repetition and The Logic of Sense. With Guattari, philosophy becomes machinic and political, a multiple practice, and an intervention on psychoanalysis and modern psychoses. Thinkers such as Badiou, therefore, who argue that the philosophical content of Deleuze’s thought is contained purely within the early works show a fundamental misunderstanding of the project of Deleuze and Guattari. They invert the natural order of Deleuze and Guattari’s own account of their work. Difference and Repetition sets out the criteria which a new style of philosophy must adopt, but it is A Thousand Plateaus which takes seriously the need to move away from a philosophy of essence, and hence a thinking in terms of depth, a form of thought itself criticised in The Logic of Sense. It is in his collaborations with Guattari that Deleuze claims that the actual practice of the new philosophy heralded in Difference and Repetition became possible. A Thousand Plateaus, for Deleuze, did not represent simply a new philosophical position, but rather a whole new way of doing philosophy.\n\nThe root-book So if A Thousand Plateaus takes up Deleuze’s critique of classical philosophy, how does this critique manifest itself in the structure of A Thousand Plateaus itself? At the heart of A Thousand Plateaus is the vegetal image of thought. It is this that leads Deleuze’s major collaboration with Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, to manifest a new philosophical style. We can begin to see how it achieves this by turning to the contents page of the book itself. Here, rather a set of chapters, we find a list of fifteen plateaus, each on idiosyncratic topics such as how one makes a body without organs, war machines, and the possibility of a geology of morals. Superficially, these appear to be chapters in all but name, but as Deleuze and Guattari note,\n\n6 | a thousand pl ateaus a nd ph ilo s o ph y ‘it’s like a set of split rings. You can fit anyone of them into any other. Each ring, or each plateau, ought to have its own climate, its own tone or timbre’ (Deleuze 1995a: 25). We can understand the move Deleuze and Guattari are making by comparing it to their characterisation of the alternative – the root-book: A first type of book is the root-book. The tree is already the image of the world, or the root the image of the world-tree. This is the classical book, as noble, signifying, and subjective organic interiority (the strata of the book). The book imitates the world, as art imitates nature: by procedures specific to it that accomplish what nature cannot or can no longer do. (ATP 5)\n\nWe can work through some implications of this account now. First, this definition of a philosophical work dates back to Plato, who makes a similar claim that a work must have an organic structure: Every discourse (logos) must be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must be neither without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole work.4\n\nAt the heart of the concept of the organism is that it is teleological – it functions for some purpose. It is this purpose that gives meaning to the parts of the organism by allowing them to be defined by their relations to the whole. Secondly, as Kant writes in the Critique of Judgement, the nature of the whole is defined by the reciprocal relations of the parts. Thus, Kant writes that ‘just as each part exists only as a result of all the rest, so we think of each part as existing for the sake of the others and of the whole, i.e. as an instrument (organ)’ (Kant 1987: §373). As Kant makes clear, the reason for the introduction of the categories of the organic is that an understanding of the world purely in terms of physics is unable to explain why certain objects have an inside and an outside rather than simply being heaps of matter. Seeing the organism as unified according to a purpose gives us a way of making a sharp distinction between the inside and the outside, and understanding a philosophical text on the model of an organism similarly allows us to see it as closed and complete. Once we do so, we develop the other characteristics of the root-book. As the book is complete in itself, its reference to the world is as a model for what it discusses. The root-book introduces an ontological rift between the world and our representation of it. Further, this structure of imitation operates in a manner that differs from what it is discussing. The book accomplishes ‘what nature cannot or can no longer do’. A traditional text does not simply imitate nature as it is, but rather determines those features of it that are essential.\n\ni ntroducti on | 7 The classic model of an organic system would be Hegel’s philosophy, which develops a sophisticated web of concepts where the meaning of each is determined by the meaning of all of the others, as in a form of life, and while the system extends to infinity, it remains closed or totalised. Here, the determination of concepts takes place immanently, purely in terms of the unfolding of internal principles. We can see a precursor to this in the immanent development of Descartes’ metaphysics from the single Archimedean point of the cogito. Here we have here a sequence of linear descent, which Deleuze and Guattari align with an arborescent image of thought.5\n\nThe rhizome So here we can return to the notion of a plateau. In a classical philosophical text, the chapters follow one another in a sequence, with each building on the results of the previous chapter. The structure is much like Descartes’ hierarchy of the sciences, where we progressively move from a set of presuppositions to a conclusion through a series of arguments. However, the plateaus of A Thousand Plateaus are not determined by an overarching unity that closes the text in on itself. While Deleuze and Guattari still take up the model of life, rather than the closed model of the organism, they favour an open model that encompasses symbiotic relationships between organisms, and the transversal communication of DNA between species.6 As such, in A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari try to put into practice the implications of their critique of the philosophical question, ‘What is it?’ In moving to the questions, ‘Which one?’ ‘Where?’ ‘When?’ ‘How?’ ‘How many?’ ‘In which case?’ and ‘Who?’, they call for a new form of writing. For this reason, A Thousand Plateaus is rhizomatic rather than taking the tree as its model. It presents itself as a series of interconnected moments, where one can begin anywhere, and read the plateaus in any order. As such, rather than seeing plateaus as layers that one must move through, they are better seen as the dimensions of a space, where one can move from one plateau to another simply by a reorientation and change in direction, and each intersects all of the others. Deleuze and Guattari describe it as follows: The rhizome is altogether different, a map and not a tracing. Make a map, not a tracing. The orchid does not reproduce the tracing of the wasp; it forms a map with the wasp, in a rhizome. What distinguishes the map from the tracing is that it is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in contact with the real. The map does not reproduce an unconscious closed in upon itself; it constructs the unconscious. It fosters connections between fields,\n\n8 | a thousand pl ateaus a nd ph ilo s o ph y the removal of blockages on bodies without organs, the maximum opening of bodies without organs onto a plane of consistency. It is itself a part of the rhizome. The map is open and connectable in all of its dimensions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to constant modification. It can be torn, reversed, adapted to any kind of mounting, reworked by an individual, group, or social formation. It can be drawn on a wall, conceived of as a work of art, constructed as a political action or as a meditation. Perhaps one of the most important characteristics of the rhizome is that it always has multiple entryways; in this sense, the burrow is an animal rhizome, and sometimes maintains a clear distinction between the line of flight as passageway and storage or living strata (cf. the muskrat). A map has multiple entryways, as opposed to the tracing, which always comes back ‘to the same’. (ATP 12)\n\nWhether this project is successful (and Deleuze would later suggest that A Thousand Plateaus may indeed be a productive failure) (Deleuze and Parnet 1987: 17), it at the least opens up new possibilities for doing philosophy, and shows that any re-evaluation of the philosophical enterprise cannot simply be restricted to a change in argument, but calls also for a reappraisal of the whole style of philosophical enquiry.\n\nNotes 1. Badiou 2000. Quotation taken from translator’s introduction, xii. 2. This more creative approach to the practice of philosophy, as a forerunner of the innovations of A Thousand Plateaus, can be found in the serial structure, textual openness, conceptual ambiguity and multiple voices of The Logic of Sense, a text contemporary to Difference and Repetition. See Williams 2008: ch. 1. 3. For a detailed account of Deleuze and Guattari on the creation of concepts, see Bell 2016: ch. 1. 4. Plato 1997a: 264c. Cf. Jacques Derrida’s essay, ‘Plato’s Pharmacy’, in Derrida 1982 for a discussion of organic metaphors in Plato. Derrida is close to Deleuze and Guattari in this essay, both in his analysis of the impossibility of the organicist conception of the text actually providing closure, and in his own recognition that the implications of this are a new style of philosophising. 5. See Miguel Beistegui’s contribution to this volume for the relationship between Descartes and arborescence. 6. As Simon O’Sullivan notes in his contribution to this volume, the very openness of Deleuze and Guattari’s system means that any attempt to delimit a purely philosophical content to the project risks construing it as a closed system. Nonetheless, we follow Deleuze and Guattari here, when they note in the analysis of smooth and striated space that ‘de facto mixes do not preclude a de jure, or abstract, distinction’ (ATP 475). In this volume, we recognise that any purely philosophical content must be seen as ­growing rhizomatically with the ‘non-philosophical’.\n\nChapter 1\n\n‘A book? What book?’ Or Deleuze and Guattari on the Rhizome Miguel de Beistegui\n\nIn an upland area in the Limousin region of France stretches the vast and sparsely populated Plateau de Millevaches. Nearby lies the village of SaintLéonard-de-Noblat, where Deleuze and his wife shared a house, which Fanny had inherited from her father. From the house, when the weather permits it, one can see the plateau. Deleuze wrote most of his books while on holiday in that part of the country, which he described as ‘very soft and powerful’ (Maggiori 2000). It is apt, therefore, that one of his books, if only by way of something resembling a humorous homage, include a reference to the plateau that harbours a thousand vaches (the etymology of which is entirely disputed). But, as we know, it is in fact more than a reference: ‘plateau’ is a key deleuzo-guattarian concept. To name a book of philosophy after a place, or, better said perhaps, to turn a geographical entity into a philosophical concept is not an innocent gesture. It is a very deliberate one, which treats its ‘chapters’ as if they were geological formations, and the book as a whole as if it were a map that could be read in a variety of ways, and infinitely redrawn. Yet even this ‘as if’ is insufficient: the book is indeed a map or mapping of a land (let us say, the land of philosophical problems) that does not exist ‘out there’, already made, and this in such a way that an acute vision equipped with the necessary tools would be able to trace its contours; it exists even less in the authors’ minds, as a testimony to the richness of their imagination. Rather, it is itself part of the reality it describes: it is not a copy, a representation, or even an interpretation of the world, but a conceptual construction (with concepts such as ‘stratification’, ‘assemblage’, ‘rhizome’, ‘body without organs’, ‘deterritorialisation’, ‘abstract machine’, ‘multiplicity’, ‘becoming’, ‘major and minor’, ‘molar and molecular’), a small machine that connects with other machines, a concept-thing plugged into a variety of\n\n10 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y things (the unconscious, language, the earth, literature, power, capitalism, space, history), an assemblage that produces innumerable effects. It is not about those things, or about anything: ‘a book has neither object nor subject; it is made of variously formed matters’ (ATP 3). We desperately want books to mean something (preferably something important), to signify. Of a book, a painting, or an event, we ask: ‘What does it mean?’ To which Deleuze and Guattari answer: ‘We will never ask what a book means, as signifier and signified; we will not look for anything to understand in it; but we will ask what it functions with . . .’ This functionalist conception of thought, of writing, and of the book, replaces its classical hermeneutic and essentialist (‘What is it about?’) conception. A Thousand Plateaus is a breath of fresh air for philosophy: a new climate, a new landscape. A biting, sweeping wind blows on these plateaus, one that also stirs the blood, carrying you away. Mille plateaux is a new way of understanding philosophy, not through its great authors or texts, not as a succession of endlessly redefined periods, and even less as a history whose development would be driven by a Meaning or by the promise of an End. It is not even a series of responses to its ‘fundamental problems’. Philosophy, and more generally, thought, now consists of wild, nomadic lines inscribed on a system grid-locked by power apparatuses, on rigid and fixed frames of thought, or patterns of territorialisation. A Thousand Plateaus turns everything outwards: it is a book that tears thought away from inwardness, from the hearth, from domesticity, and sends it outside; in other words, into that with which it can combine and assemble itself, and become something else. Its concepts are now gusts in a landscape: gusts of wind, visceral cries, a hammer’s blow. They are formed in proximity to strange creatures and objects that populate these plateaus: beasts (rats, wolves, tics, ants, cockroaches, lobsters); familiar tunes (ritournelles), songs and groans; conceptual characters (Professor Challenger, the ‘Indian’, ‘a’ woman, ‘a’ child); waves; eggs; tubers; faces; fabrics . . . the list goes on. There are even dates (1914, 1000 bc, 20 November 1923, etc.) and illustrations (a blueprint, a photograph, a drawing, a score) corresponding to the different plateaus. And yet there is no chronology, no history for this philosophy that departs from Meaning in order to engage with Experimentation. It is no longer a question of interpretation, nor is it even one of understanding; rather, it is a question of learning – in other words, of daring: daring to experiment, to create, to make one’s own machines (social, amorous, literary, scientific, etc.). If we write, it is to become something else, to fall into another state, to live differently. That is what is called ‘to rhizome’ (‘faire rhizome’). As a result, Mille plateaux is not a book on or about which one should write. It doesn’t lend itself to exegetical readings, interpretations or\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 11 critiques. It is there to be written or experimented with, to be picked up and used – or not. In fact, Deleuze and Guattari argue that other than the conclusion, which they claim should be saved for the end, the plateaus can be read in any order. Still, very much aware of the novelty of their approach, of the new demands that they put on the genre of the philosophical book, Deleuze and Guattari write an Introduction in which they raise the question of the book. What is a book? What is it for? What sort of book is A Thousand Plateaus?\n\nThe question of the book It is a question that Deleuze had already raised towards the very beginning of Difference and Repetition, a book in which he spoke in his own name for the first time: ‘The time is coming when it will hardly be possible to write a book of philosophy as it has been done for so long: “Ah! The old style . . .”’ (Deleuze 1994: xxi).1 In the same preface, and much to our surprise, Deleuze presents his book as a kind of detective novel, as well as a work of science fiction (Deleuze 1994: xx). A detective novel, insofar as the characters that populate it, namely, its concepts, should be seen as detectives who intervene to resolve local and changing problems, or ‘dramas’, imbedded in a ‘here-and-now’. Concepts, then, insofar as they are local and respond to a logic of the ‘encounter’, rather than of ‘recognition’, are forced into existence by a power that is not their own doing, and which Deleuze defines as Ideas, or ‘problems’. As such, they are created, like fictitious characters whose existence is mapped not after general ideas and eternal essences, but specific – yet not straightforwardly empirical – situations. As for the reference to science fiction, it stems from the fact that the ‘here-and-now’ in question is also ‘nowhere’: at once impersonal, in that it does not find its source in a self or a cogito, and pre-individual, in that it envelops the conditions of all individuality, it is best understood as Erewhon. This reference to Samuel Butler’s novel and fictitious country evokes a space and time – an intensive spatium – of thought that is no more our own, that of mankind, than that of God.2 Elsewhere, Deleuze claims that ‘what is neither individual nor personal are . . . emissions of singularity’ that ‘occur on an unconscious surface’. They are characterised by a ‘nomadic distribution’, which contrasts with the ‘sedentary’ or fixed distribution that characterise the syntheses of consciousness (Deleuze 1990b: 102). With its concepts of ‘virtuality’ and ‘actuality’, of pure, intensive ‘multiplicities’, on the one hand, and intensities that are already developed in ‘extensions’ and covered over in ‘qualities’, on the other, Difference and Repetition had only begun to map those impersonal surfaces\n\n12 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y and spaces, insisting all along that this transcendental ‘ground’ was nothing like – that is, did not resemble, or was not modelled after – the empirical world. Recognition (récognition) and resemblance are two of the key ‘postulates’ or ‘illusions’ of the ‘dogmatic image of thought’, which Difference and Repetition identifies, and sees as limiting the essentially creative power of thought.3 But the reference to science fiction in Difference and Repetition should also be understood in another sense: to write a book of philosophy is to write at the very limit of one’s knowledge (savoir), that is, at the point at which the process of learning becomes more important than that of actual cognition (connaissance) and recognition. It is not, therefore, a matter of epistemology: ‘I am well aware,’ Deleuze writes in Difference and Repetition, ‘that I have spoken about science in a way that was not scientific’ (Deleuze 1994: xxi). Echoing this early statement, A Thousand Plateaus says: ‘At no point do we claim the title of science’ (ATP 22). But to write at the limit is also to write at the limit of oneself, that is, at the point at which one is finally able to become someone or something else: Why have we kept our own names? Out of habit, purely out of habit. To make ourselves unrecognisable in turn . . . To reach, not the point when one longer says I, but the point where it is no longer of any importance whether one says I. We are no longer ourselves. (ATP 3)\n\nIn many ways, Deleuze’s prophetic statement regarding ‘the old style’ doesn’t quite apply to Difference and Repetition, which, because of its doctoral and academic nature, continued to conform to the classical model of the book. Logic of Sense, published only a year after Difference and Repetition, introduced a significant stylistic break and a series of formal (as well as conceptual) innovations, such as the ‘series’, which replace the traditional chapters. But it is not until Deleuze began to write with Guattari that this new image of the book, and this new style, which was to match the new, non-dogmatic image of thought already introduced in Difference and Repetition, became a reality. Anti-Oedipus demonstrates the critical, satirical and utterly irreverent side of their collaboration. It is philosophising with a hammer at its freest. A Thousand Plateaus introduces a dose of sobriety and reflexivity, visible throughout the book, but articulated as such in the Introduction. ‘Rhizome’ is a presentation of the book as a whole, and a reflection on the manner in which it operates – not according to a linear, arche-teleological structure, with chapters written in succession, and marking its progress, but as a juxtaposition of ‘plateaus’, which communicate with one another simultaneously and in a potentially infinite number of ways: ‘We are writing this book as a rhizome. It is composed of plateaus’ (ATP 22). The book does not have a beginning,\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 13 a middle and an end: ‘a rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo’ (ATP 25). Like grass, or like the sentence of Proust and the Recherche as a whole, A Thousand Plateaus grows from the middle. It happens in the middle, between fixed points, where things gather speed and initiate transversal movements, through which they communicate with other in-betweens. Speaking of Kleist, Lenz and Büchner in relation to the German language, but also Henry Miller, the beatniks, Patti Smith or native Americans, Deleuze and Guattari write: ‘they know how to move between things, establish a logic of the AND, overthrow ontology, do away with foundations, nullify endings and beginnings’ (ATP 25). If – and that is a big ‘if’ – ontology is necessarily archaeological and teleological, foundational and destinal, then ‘nomadology’ is the suspension of ontology: it cuts across it, passes through its mesh, deterritorialises it.\n\nThe classical image of the book: the tree In their Introduction (a final concession, perhaps, to the classical genre of the book), Deleuze and Guattari contrast the image of the rhizome, to which we will return, with that of the tree, which Western thought, if not Western culture as a whole (and that includes its agriculture), has privileged systematically. There is, to begin with, the tree of knowledge and the tree of original sin, the genealogical tree and its archetype, the tree of Jesse. We use the image of the tree, with its roots, branches and fruits, to define our sense of provenance, personal identity and future. We want things and people to have an origin and a goal, or a purpose. This is what Deleuze and Guattari have to say about this kind of interest: ‘Where are you going? Where are you coming from? What are you heading for? These are totally useless questions’ (ATP 25). We should be asking instead: ‘How do you (or they) work, what do you (or they) work with? And what effects do those connections produce?’ The tree is also, and primarily, as Bachelard has argued, the image of the image itself, or the primordial symbol: it contains and even gathers the fundamental images – water, air, fire, earth – from which the life of the imagination springs, the elemental stuff that sustains our rêveries, fantasies and metaphors. In La terre et les rêveries du repos, for example, Bachelard goes as far as to claim that ‘imagination is a tree’.4 If that’s the case, we shouldn’t be surprised to see trees proliferate not only in myths and narratives, but in philosophy and science as well. We need only think of the ‘family tree’ of Porphyry, which classifies things under genera and species, the bishop of Orléans Théodulphe’s tree of knowledge and wisdom (sophia), or the tree\n\n14 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y of natural historians (Pallas, Buffon, Lamarck), which was itself followed by the phylogenetic tree of evolution (Darwin, Haeckel). It is important to emphasise the taxonomic as well as symbolic value of the image of the tree: we use it to define how we think, know and make sense of the world, and ourselves; but we also use it to distinguish, classify, order. It is a model that we find at work in more recent sciences, such as computer science (the ‘data tree’), neurophysiology (in connection with the brain, and memory especially), and linguistics. Until Saussure, who, tongue in cheek, illustrates his theory of the arbitrariness of the sign, and thus of the operation of signification, with the example of the word ‘tree’, the genesis and evolution of idioms was – and still is – thought through the image of the tree, and of roots. But it is the production of sense that is itself thought of through the paradigm of arborescence. Even Chomsky, who breaks with the idea of linguistics as a kind of verbal botany, aims to classify the elements of human languages and, in the process, operates through dichotomies. His ‘generative grammar’ is a theory regarding the deep structures of sentences that underlie their surface structures. On their own, the latter cannot account for a wide range of syntactical facts, such as ambiguous sentences, or the potentially infinite number of sentences contained in any language.5 As a result, structuralist linguists tended to avoid them. In his grammar, Chomsky organised the structure of the sentence according to an arborescent plan, which, from the sentence, led to its different branches and sub-branches (the noun phrase, which can itself be divided into article and noun; the verb phrase, which can itself be divided into verb and noun phrase, etc.). In addition, and in order to account for the fact that phrase structure rules tend to overlook certain ambiguities of language and conceal differences, Chomsky also included ‘transformational rules’, which also correspond to a tree-like structure. Should we be surprised, in the end, to see the tree elevated to the level of the image of thought and knowledge itself? Deleuze and Guattari mention the relatively late example of Julien Pacotte, author of Le réseau arborescent, schème primordial de la pensée, in which he defines that structure as ‘the real foundation of formal thought’.6 But all philosophers have in mind Descartes. To be sure, in his philosophical dialogue, The Search for Truth by Means of Natural Light, Epistemon, who incarnates the figure of the scholar, registers his discontent before the manner in which Eudoxus (Descartes’ spokesperson) treats Porphyry’s tree, and the knowledge for which its stands: ‘I am sorry you despise the tree of Porphyry, which the learned have always admired, and . . .’ (Descartes 1984: 410). And yet, if he criticises it, it is to replace it with a more adequate image of the tree of knowledge, expressed in the following famous passage from the Principles of Philosophy:\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 15 Thus the whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. (Descartes 1985a: 186)\n\nSuch would be the destiny of Western thought: to find the ground, to uncover the roots; to go ever deeper and discover the unshakable foundation, the undisputable origin.\n\nThe critique of arborescent thought It is that image that Deleuze and Guattari want to uproot from our mind, that tree – of life, knowledge and thought – that they want to cut down: ‘We have grown tired of the tree . . .’ (ATP 15) But why? What exactly is the problem with arborescent thinking? To begin with, it is mimetic: it functions according to principles of imitation and resemblance. This, in turn, should be understood in two ways. First of all, it claims to represent the word, or to be an image of it. But in the end, it is just that, namely, an image, a representation, and one that is necessarily disconnected from the world. In fact, it introduces a dualism between it and the world. It is not of the world, it does not interact with it, or transform it. It is only a copy (calque) of the world. But – and this is the second aspect – it is a false copy, in that the tracing paper it uses to reproduce the world only selects some of its features, those that agree in advance with the image of the world it has already generated. The tracing paper of the tree has been drawn up in advance, and is superimposed on to the world, thus giving us the same image. In truth, it is the world itself that is modelled after the tree. Thus, language, the unconscious, the brain, power, etc. are all illustrations of the arch-image of the tree. The logic of the tree ‘consists of copying and tracing [décalquer], on the basis of an overcoding structure of supporting axis, something that we assume is ready-made [quelque chose qu’on se donne tout fait]’ (ATP 12, translation modified). The principle of imitation – especially in the form of the Idea and its copies – is one that Deleuze had already criticised and deconstructed in ‘Plato and the Simulacrum’ and Difference and Repetition: it is, he claims, at the heart of the system of representation that Plato introduces, and Aristotle systematises.7 The ontological sameness (auto kath’auto) of the Platonic Idea gives way to the identity of the Aristotelian concept, which divides itself into specific differences, and those differences into further differences. The principle of imitation is carried over into transcendental philosophy, which tends to model the transcendental after the empirical, and thus identify conditions that are only conditions of possibility. This\n\n16 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y is how, in Difference and Repetition, Deleuze sees Kant’s transcendental deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding, and of the exposition of the a priori upon which the possibility of experience rests, as a betrayal of the ‘prodigious domain of the transcendental’, which, ‘like a great explorer’, Kant had nonetheless discovered. The betrayal in question, Deleuze argues, is precisely due to the fact that, in his attempt to locate the conditions of experience in the threefold synthesis of ‘apprehension in intuition’, of ‘reproduction in imagination’ and of ‘recognition in a concept’, Kant ultimately subordinates them to the latter, and to the figure of the ‘I think’, to which all the faculties are related: It is clear that, in this manner, Kant traces [décalque] the so-called transcendental structures from the empirical acts of a psychological consciousness: the transcendental synthesis of apprehension is directly induced from an empirical apprehension, and so on. In order to hide this all too obvious procedure, Kant suppressed this text in the second edition. Although it is better hidden, the tracing method [la méthode du décalque], with all its ‘psychologism’, nevertheless subsists. (Deleuze 1994: 134)\n\nA second problem with the image of the tree, as we have just begun to see, is that it is irreducibly binary, or dichotomous: first, we are told, there is the One, then the One becomes two, and the two four, etc. But this is not the way nature works. In nature ‘roots are taproots with a more multiple, lateral, and circular system of ramification, rather than a dichotomous one’ (ATP 5). Dichotomies are the very structure of reproduction, and can be reproduced ad infinitum: n +1. Thirdly, and as an immediate consequence of its binary structure, the tree is hierarchical and vertical. As such, it perpetuates a model of thought and reality that is essentially a model of centralised and authoritative power. It presupposes a point of origin, a source, from which all follows, through a process of derivation, division, reproduction and copying. Consider the example of psychoanalysis. To be sure, it discovers this great new continent, the unconscious, with its wealth of productive potential, but only to subject it to arborescent structures and to an entire centralised system, a command centre, the Father, or the Phallus, from which everything else derives. We should not be surprised, therefore, to see psychoanalysis also generate its own generals, and quarrel over who is the true leader (General Freud or General Lacan?). In the end, the tree or the root ‘inspire a sad image of thought’, which nomadic thought is to replace with a more joyous one, that of the rhizome. It is sad because it severs thought from its noetic, experimental power, because it brings it back into the fixed, vertical and hierarchical structure of the tree, when all it wants is to grow horizontally and in different directions at the same time, connect with other stems, in short, faire rhizome. Any attempt to introduce a moment of transcendence\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 17 in the immanence of thought generates a blockage, a sedentary or fixed structure, which inhibits thought.\n\nThe new image of the book: the rhizome The image of the rhizome makes its first appearance in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, published in 1974 (Deleuze and Guattari 1986). It is introduced at the very outset, and with a view to explaining the sort of books that Kafka writes: ‘How can we enter into Kafka’s work? This work is a rhizome, a burrow’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 3). Like the hotel in America, which has many main and side doors, Kafka’s works – his longer novels especially – have many points of entrance, each equally valid, each denying from the start the possibility of a centre, a single sensitive point or signifier, from which the work as a whole would radiate, and from which it would be interpreted: We will enter, then, by any point whatsoever; none matters more than another . . . We will be trying only to discover what other points our entrance connects to, what crossroads and galleries one passes through to link two points, what the map of the rhizome and how the map is modified if one enters by another point. (Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 3)\n\nIn other words, the manner in which the points connect with one another is not set in advance, and is susceptible to endless variations, each producing a different map, and a different experience. Connect this point (or door) with that one, rather than with that other point, and the reality in question reveals a new assemblage, new horizons, and a new map (of life, the social body, the heart, history or the unconscious). This new distribution of singular points, this new and changing cartography, is indistinguishable from experimentation, which now replaces interpretation or cognition as the main task of thinking. Yet we need to be careful, as not all points, and not all assemblages, are equal: some points criss-cross an area, coordinate, striate, delimit, enclose, territorialise, sedentarise; others are free, floating, oceanic points, which escape the grid-like assemblages of the former, drift and head off for the open sea, deterritorialise, like a submarine beneath the striated surface of the ocean. Some points trace (décalquent) and stratify, while others map. Some points draw dichotomies, while others construct rhizomes. For example, there is the triangle of desire that is generated by singling out the points ‘daddy’, ‘mummy’, ‘me’. This triangulation of desire is its strangulation. And then there is the multiplicity of animals that populate Kafka’s world. There is the becoming-cockroach of Gregor, which is entirely constituted by vibrations, intensities, thresholds that,\n\n18 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y taken together, amount to lines of flight that escape the family triangle, but also the bureaucratic and commercial triangle. Equally, we could say that the academic philosopher’s desire to teach and write is (increasingly) triangulated, and territorialised, through the construction of the bureaucratic machine (and its ‘Research Excellence Framework’, ‘Teaching Excellence Framework’, ‘National Student Survey’, etc.), the commercial machine (with its paradigm of productivity as defined by external powers), and the technological machine (with the platforms on and through which that desire is oriented and framed). But there are also lines of flight and resistance, encounters and surprises, generated by books (such as A Thousand Plateaus), students, demonstrations, etc. Two years after the publication of Kafka, Deleuze and Guattari published a short book entitled The Rhizome, in which they turned that image into a philosophical concept, and around which they eventually organised their philosophy and new ‘image’ of thought.8 It is the content of that short text that was inserted as the Introduction to A Thousand Plateaus, a book which Deleuze and Guattari wanted to construct like The Castle. Why the rhizome? Because, like the tree and the root, it signals a process of growth, or the manner in which something unfolds, or happens. However, A rhizome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes. Plants with roots or radicles may be rhizomorphic in other respects altogether: we can wonder whether botany, in its specificity, is not entirely rhizomatic. Even some animals are, in their pack form. Rats are rhizomes. Burrows are too, in all of their functions of shelter, supply, movement, evasion, and breakout. (ATP 7–8, translation modified)\n\nYet even in the rhizome, there is something to leave out: ‘the best and the worst: potato and couchgrass, or weeds’. It is not a panacea or a universal remedy. Besides, no lateral movement, no process of deterritorialisation, no line of flight will ever guarantee a final and definitive protection against processes of reterritorialisation, micro-fascisms, reactionary organisations of power. In fact, the latter are almost inevitable, which means that the lines of flight need to be reactivated, reinvented or replaced by entirely new ones. But a slightly more systematic approach is required. The rhizome can be said to have the following advantages over the tree. To begin with, and where the image of the tree privileges a logic of imitation, resemblance and identity, the rhizome privileges one of connection and heterogeneity. A book does not try to imitate the world, or be like it, but to ‘form a rhizome with the world [faire rhizome avec le monde]’ (ATP 11). In a rhizome, and as we have already seen in connection with Kafka’s novels and stories, a\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 19 point can and must be connected with any other point. This is unlike the tree, which fixes points along a vertical axis. This, in turn, means that the rhizome corresponds to a changing or nomadic distribution of points, one that leads to a manifold of configurations and connections. By the same token, the rhizome does not correspond to a dialectical logic of division, to a One that becomes two, or a command centre that distributes itself all the way down (or up) the tree. Earlier, I suggested that the reason why arborescent thought was problematic was because of its binary approach, which reduces a system (linguistic, unconscious, physical, or economic) with many singular points that changes its nature as it expands its connections, to the repetitive and dull play of the One and the two, four, etc. A rhizome, Deleuze explains in Negotiations, is a kind of open system, and an open system is precisely one whose concepts correspond to events and circumstances, rather than essences (Deleuze 1995a: 32). An open system is defined by its ‘thresholds’ and ‘points of bifurcation’, which force it into a different state. It is defined by differences that are qualitative. Let me return to the example of Chomsky. The charge, in essence, is that his grammar remains too hierarchical and abstract, too syntactical, too authoritarian, too closed up on itself to understand the manner in which language is always and from the start connected with linguistic contents that are semantic and pragmatic, with statements that are collective, in short, with a ‘micropolitics of the social field’ (ATP 7). Naturally, Chomsky’s radical politics aren’t what is at stake here. What matters, rather, is the fact that his generative grammar remains caught up in the diktat of the Sentence, in the same way that Lacanian psychoanalysis remains hung up on that of the Signifier: ‘Chomsky’s grammaticality, the categorical S symbol that dominates every sentence, is first and foremost a marker of power, and then a syntactic marker: you will construct grammatically correct sentences, you will divide each sentence into a noun phrase and a verb phrase (first dichotomy . . .)’ (ATP 7, translation modified). The problem with trees – no matter how formal and scientific – is that they introduce structures of power, and turn a phenomenon – an ‘assemblage’ – that is essentially fluid and collective into a fixed order and a sedentary hierarchy. What, instead, does the rhizomatic approach to language offer? It identifies ‘semiotic chains [chaînons]’ that are connected not internally, according to formal rules, but externally, through other connections: ‘A rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic chains, organisations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles’ (ATP 7). A semiotic chain is not a discrete linguistic unity, but a linguistic segment or ‘tuber’ that connects with, and is traversed by, all those heterogeneous elements (social struggles, power structures, cultural circumstances). In that respect, it is ‘closer’ to those elements, without\n\n20 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y being ‘like’ them. This principle is crucial, as it can apply to a variety of phenomena and fields: in the end, there is more in common between a motorcycle and a race horse than between a race horse and plough horse; or there is more in common between a fin and a hand than between a hand and a glove. This is because rhizomatic thought connects segments of bodies with other segments by referring them back to a logic not of resemblance, division and categorical consistency, but of problems. Of course, it will always be possible to break language down into internal structural elements, and go down the path of dichotomies. But that operation is a taming and police operation, one that closes language on itself. The rhizomatic approach, on the other hand, treats language like ‘a patch of oil’ that spreads outwards and laterally, and joins other segments, to reveal a ‘machinic assemblage’ or a ‘multiplicity’ (ATP 7). Deleuze never tired of repeating the distinction between the dialectical play of the One and the many, and the substantive ‘multiplicity’.9 Difference and Repetition already defined philosophy as the science of pure multiplicities, or virtual singularities, and saw the latter as the conditions of emergence of actual phenomena, or as the real (but not actual) horizon from which they arise. A multiplicity is defined not by a fixed distribution of points within a given dimension, but by the fact that its nature changes as its connections and dimensions increase. In other words, it does not have a core nature, a centre or an essence, which tolerates variations, modifications or additions. Rather, it is entirely exhausted by its connections or lines, and its (rhizomatic) unity does not require a higher unity: ‘There are no points or positions in a rhizome, such as those found in a structure, tree, or root. There are only lines’ (ATP 8). Unlike Difference and Repetition, which did not quite manage to be or function like a multiplicity, and remained caught within the traditional structure of the book, A Thousand Plateaus, through the connections it establishes with the world outside it, and between its various plateaus, does. Or at least it does its very best to function like one: ‘The ideal for a book would be to lay everything out on a plane of exteriority of this kind, on a single page, the same sheet: lived events, historical determinations, concepts, individuals, groups, social formations’ (ATP 9). This flattening of concepts and discursive practices, of social groups and political circumstances, of lived experiences and economic flows, amounts to a systematic dismantling of the order and hierarchies that root-thought tries to introduce. The world of multiplicities is entirely flat and exogenous. Together, they constitute a ‘plane of consistency’: All multiplicities are flat, in the sense that they fill or occupy all of their dimensions: we will therefore speak of a plane of consistency of multiplicities, even though the dimensions of this ‘plane’ increase with the number of con-\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 21 nections that are made on it. Multiplicities are defined by the outside: by the abstract line, the line of flight or deterritorialisation according to which they change in nature and connect with other multiplicities. (ATP 9)\n\nBy plane of consistency, then, Deleuze and Guattari mean the flat plane on which all multiplicities occur and grow (flat multiplicities of n dimensions), and which renders them consistent with one another, without locating them on a vertical axis or ascribing them a direction or goal. To write, then, is to form a rhizome with the world, and not produce an image of it. It is to mix one’s own destiny and heterogeneity with that of the world, to evolve with it, but in a way that is ‘aparallel’. To illustrate their view, Deleuze and Guattari refer to the example of the wasp and the orchid, and to the phenomenon known as ‘sexual deception’. On the face of it, the relation between the orchid and the wasp is one of imitation and signification, of resemblance and deception: doesn’t the orchid masquerade as a wasp, and simulate in its core the presence of the sexual organ of the wasp female? This is how one biologist puts it: Ophys flowers mimic virgin females of their pollinators, and male insects are lured to the orchid by volatile semiochemicals and visual cues. At close range, chemical signals from the flowers elicit sexual behaviour in males, which try to copulate with the flower labellum and respond as if in the presence of female sex pheromones. Thereby the male touches the gynostemium, and the pollinia may become attached to his head or, in some species, to the tip of his abdomen. His copulatory attempts with another flower ensure that the pollinia are transferred to the flower’s stigmatic surface and pollination is ensured. (Ayasse et al. 2003: 517)\n\nThe point, here, is that orchids have evolved with the capacity to produce the sexual pheromones of a wasp that serves as its pollinator, and to present the appearance of the female wasp herself. What, if anything, is wrong with that picture? It perpetuates the Platonic idea (and ideal) of an original and a copy, of a model and a (more or less authentic) imitation. Instead, Deleuze and Guattari want to see the relation between the wasp and the orchid as a single material process, a vital and evolutionary assemblage that defies the representational logic of fixed, already individuated substances, as well as the purely arborescent image of evolution, which would proceed only and inevitably from the least to the more differentiated. Deleuze and Guattari replace that image (the image of the image itself) with a rhizomatic model that operates from the start within the domain of heterogeneity, with one already differentiated line jumping to another.10 In the case of the orchid and the wasp, there is no deception or lure; there is only a ‘becoming’ bringing together two sets of dispositions and capacities. In the wasp–orchid assemblage, it becomes impossible to say where one begins, and the other ends: the boundaries between them become blurred. In fact,\n\n22 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y the reality takes place not between two previously individuated substances, but as the process of individuation itself. The reality is the in-between itself, the intermezzo. What we have is a complex process of territorialisation and deterritorialisation, in which the stratum of a plant line intersects unexpectedly with the stratum of an animal line: The orchid deterritorialises by forming an image, a tracing of a wasp; but the wasp reterritorialises on that image. The wasp is nevertheless deterritorialised, becoming a piece in the orchid’s reproductive apparatus. But it reterritorialises the orchid by transporting its pollen. Wasp and orchid, as heterogeneous elements, form a rhizome. It could be said that the orchid imitates the wasp, reproducing the image in a signifying fashion (mimesis, mimicry, lure, etc.). But this is true only on the level of the strata – a parallelism between two strata such that a plant organisation on one imitates an animal organisation on the other. At the same time, something else entirely is going on: not imitation at all but a capture of code, surplus value of code, an increase in valence, a veritable becoming, a becoming-wasp of the orchid and a becoming-orchid of the wasp. (ATP 10)\n\nTo the fixed reality of the strata, and of the relations of resemblance to which they lend themselves, Deleuze and Guattari oppose the reality of a complex process of rerritorialisation and deterritorialisation between heterogeneous (and thus not similar) elements. The reality in question is that of a becoming. Only becoming is true being. If there is an ontology here, it is, once again, that of transversal and heterogeneous connectivity, of the in-between or the ‘and’, and not that of substance, ground and roots. Similarly, and to turn now to a literary example borrowed from Proust’s Recherche, it would seem that, in her sleep and before the eyes of her lover, Albertine resembles a plant and then a landscape. In fact, though, she is revealing lines and codes that emanate from the materiality of her sleeping body, which intersect and compose with those of a plant, and then, at a different, deeper state of sleep, with those of a certain landscape. We could go on: Daphne does not imitate a laurel tree, the crocodile does not imitate the trunk, and the chameleon does not imitate its surroundings. Rather, the two elements are caught in a reciprocal belonging, through which they become something else. Another way of understanding the relation between the wasp and the orchid, and another way of asserting the rhizome as a new image of thought, is through the distinction between the map (carte) and the tracing (calque). Earlier on, and especially in relation to Kant’s treatment of the a priori conditions of experience, we saw Deleuze criticise the method that consists in discovering the extraordinary domain of the transcendental, but only to trace it from the empirical form of the ‘I think’. A Thousand Plateaus takes this critique one step further by opposing to the\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 23 image of the map that of tracing, and, in the process, doing away with the very distinction between the transcendental and the empirical, between structure and genesis, or depth and surface. There is only one continent, which thoughts map not by applying a tracing paper on to its pre-defined contours, but by connecting with it, generating new assemblages, and revealing the ­thousand ways in which it can be read, drawn and redrawn: The map is open and connectable in all of its dimensions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to constant modification. It can be torn, reversed, adapted to any kind of mounting, reworked by any individual, group, or social formation. (ATP 12)\n\nThought draws a map of and with the world, or an aspect of it, in the same way that ‘the orchid does not reproduce the tracing of the wasp, but forms a map of and with [fait carte] the wasp, in a rhizome’ (ATP 12). Thought does not translate the world into an image; it connects with it. It is not a matter of interpretation and expertise, but of experimentation. Consider the example of little Hans, and its interpretation by Freud the Expert (Freud 1962b). Written in 1909, four years after Three Essays on Sexuality, it consists of a close analysis of Hans’s phobia of horses, the genesis and unfolding of which his father, himself a great admirer of Freud, had meticulously recorded. In addition to the horse, there are other large animals mentioned, such as giraffes. Hans speaks not of a dream, but of a thought – immediately interpreted as a phantasy – regarding a large giraffe calling out for a smaller, ‘crumpled’ giraffe, on which Hans claims to have sat in his room. The father asks his son: ‘What can it mean, a crumpled giraffe?’ But he already knows the answer: the big giraffe is the father himself, or rather his ‘big penis’, and the crumpled giraffe his wife, or rather her ‘genital organ’ (Freud 1962b: 39). It is a phantasy of incest, doubled by a castration complex caused by guilt: Hans is afraid of horses because they might bite his finger, by which he means, of course, his own ‘widdler’ or wiwimachen. When he speaks of his fear of seeing the carts pulled by bus-horses fall down as a result of having to negotiate a sharp turn in front of the family house, his father asks him: ‘Now, who is it that’s the bus-horse? Me, you or Mummy?’ (Freud 1962b: 58). What is the child to say, when his desire has been triangulated in that way? How can one ever escape this triangulation and surveillance of the unconscious? How can one extract desire from the grip of those coordinates? Like Kant, Freud discovers a new continent and a ‘prodigious domain’, that of the unconscious, but only to territorialise it, that is, to impose a fixed tracing on it, and thus force every assemblage of desire, every becoming, into its grid of intelligibility. Once the grid (or the triangle) is in place, the operation of interpretation must begin and never end. For in the face of any thought,\n\n24 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y any desire, the question will always be: who or what stands for me, Daddy or Mummy? As such, this grid is an instrument of power and control, and psychoanalysis a policing of the unconscious. This is how, extending their sustained critique of psychoanalysis in Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari describe the fate of little Hans: They kept on BREAKING HIS RHIZOME and BLOTCHING HIS MAP, setting it straight for him, blocking his every way out, until he began to desire his own shame and guilt, until they had rooted shame and guilt in him, PHOBIA (they barred him from the rhizome of the building, then from the rhizome of the street, they rooted him in his parents’ bed, they radicled him to his own body, they fixated him on Professor Freud). (ATP 14)\n\nWith his drawing and stories, Deleuze and Guattari suggest, Hans is attempting to produce his own lines of flight, to draw his own map, that is, to connect with the world outside – the animal world, the natural world, the urban world. In vain: ‘once a rhizome has been obstructed, arborified, it’s all over, no desire stirs; for it is always by rhizome that desire moves and produces’ (ATP 14). To the tracing of psychoanalysis, Deleuze and Guattari oppose the cartography of schizo-analysis, as represented, for example, by the educator and social worker Fernand Deligny, who joined the clinic of La Borde in the 1960s and worked closely with autistic children.11 In the words of one commentator: ‘He provided a space for severely autistic, mostly mute children to work through their difficulties by teaching them to make and spin wandering lines with no emphasis on reasons or meaning as such and to perform various open ended daily wanderings of “acting” and “doing”’ (Burk 2013). The rhizomatic nature of those maps is striking.12 The Deligny method, Deleuze and Guattari claim, consists in ‘mapping the gestures and movements of an autistic child, combining several maps for the same child, for several different children’ (ATP 14). No two maps are the same, not even for the same child. They are indeed wandering lines, lines of flight without origin and destination. As such, they are perhaps unliveable, or the unliveable within the liveable, namely, that which ­arborescent life cannot conceive or sustain.\n\nConclusion Oedipus is a tracing, Chomsky’s tree is a tracing, Kant’s threefold synthesis is a tracing. They coordinate, triangulate and strangle the unconscious, language or thought. Later on in the book, Deleuze and Guattari oppose Cuvier’s tracing and Geoffroy’s mapping in the domain of biology,\n\nd e l e u ze a nd g uat tari on the r h izo me | 25 Euclid’s metric space and Riemann’s topology in the domain of geometry, or the nomadic war machine (Genghis Khan) and the sedentary state apparatus (Odysseus). But does this not amount to another dualism, or a series of dualisms? It is true that, thus far, the series of distinctions we have come across, beginning with that of the tree and the rhizome, under which all the others are subsumed, seem to amount to something like an opposition. Yet taproots and rhizomes, tracings and maps, strata and lines of flight, processes of territorialisation and deterritorialisation (as we saw in relation to the wasp and the orchid) do not designate two separate worlds, or two parallel dimensions, but ‘assemblages’ in which two ­different ­structures are intertwined: Thus, there are very diverse map-tracing, rhizome-root assemblages, with variable coefficients of deterritorialisation. There exist tree or root-structures in rhizomes; conversely, a tree branch or root division may begin to burgeon into a rhizome . . . A new rhizome may form in the heart of a tree, the hollow of a root, the crook of a branch. Or else it is a microscopic element of the root-tree, a radicle, that gets rhizome production going. (ATP 15)\n\nThis, in turn, means that the operation of thought consists not in applying universal concepts to a given situation, but in a pragmatics that will identify and exploit its rhizomatic resources. Pragmatic rhizomes can burgeon from within Chomsky’s syntagmatic trees,13 from the bureaucratic and commercial tree of the Austro-Hungarian empire (Kafka), or even from within an oedipalised or paranoid subject (President Schreber). Conversely, though, every rhizomatic élan carries its own risks of solidification, encrustation and impasse, whether in nature, art or politics. Each political or artistic group or enterprise, each rebellion or revolution will face the risk of its own collapse – its own bureaucratisation, massification, fascisation: Every undertaking of destratification (for example, going beyond the ­organism, plunging into a becoming) must therefore observe concrete rules of extreme caution: a too-sudden destratification may be suicidal, or turn cancerous. In other words, it will sometimes end in chaos, the void and destruction, and sometimes locks us back into the strata, which become more rigid still, losing their degrees of diversity, differentiation, and mobility. (ATP 503)\n\nThe plane of arborescence is always introducing depth, hierarchies, strata and roots. The rhizome, on the other hand, implies a generalised destratification of all of nature. It does away with depth, roots and strata by introducing lines (lines of flight) and diagonals. But one plane does not replace the other, whichever way we look at it. There never is just one plane. The two planes coexist, and are always engaged in undoing one another. The\n\n26 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y first has always and already begun to give way to the second. The plane of arborescence – or, as Deleuze and Guattari call it, of organisation – is constantly working away at the plane of consistency, always trying to stop or interrupt the movements of deterritorialisation, to restratify them, reconstitute roots and radicles in a dimension of depth. At the same time, however, rhizomes are constantly growing in the root systems, breaking down hierarchies and generating assemblages. Faire rhizome, faire carte is an ongoing task, and one about which we can never say that it has ended or reached its goal. To the thousand plateaus of the eponymous book, many more need to be added. To the extraordinary range of connections it establishes, and the vertiginous creation of concepts it displays, philosophy needs to respond by making and creating many more.\n\nNotes 1.

For the Deleuze of Difference and Repetition, ‘erewhon’ indicates less a fictitious country and more the nomadic, impersonal and pre-individual Ideas that underpin and generate the world of phenomena. Ideas differ from the categories or concepts of representation, which are universal, and correspond to a sedentary distribution. But they also differ from the hic et nunc or now here of the diversity to which categories apply in representation. As such, ‘they are complexes of space and time, no doubt transportable but on condition that they impose their own scenery’ and thus become ‘the objects of an essential encounter rather than of recognition’ (Deleuze 1994: 285). 3. The epistemological concept of récognition translates the Kantian concept of Rekognition in the first edition of the Transcendental Deduction of the Critique of Pure Reason (Kant 1929: A103–110), and should be distinguished from the social and political concept of Anerkennung, also translated as recognition in English, but as reconnaissance in French. 4.

Their critique is both subtle and devastating. On the one hand, they credit Freud with discovering the unrestrained productive capacity of the unconscious. On the other hand, they excoriate him (and psychoanalysis in general) for restricting the productive capacity of the unconscious to the theatre of Oedipal representation. At the same time, their argument is not that Oedipus is illusory. On the contrary, Oedipus has very real effects. ‘We are not saying that Oedipus and castration do not amount to anything. We are oedipalised, we are castrated; psychoanalysis didn’t invent these operations, to which it merely lends the new resources and methods of its genius’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 67). Rather than simply being an invention of psychoanalysis, Deleuze and Guattari argue that Oedipus names a particular way that the productive capacity of the unconscious gets captured. On this point, they differ from psychoanalysis in two important respects: 1) Oedipus is not the seal of psychological health and well-being. It is precisely at this point that we can locate Deleuze and Guattari’s opposition between schizophrenia and neurosis which subtends both Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus. Neurosis is the tendency to capture the productive unconscious in the straitjacket of Oedipus. Schizophrenia is the tendency of the productive unconscious to escape that straitjacket. 2) Like all restrictions on the productive unconscious, Oedipus is a contingent, historical restriction and thus subject to genealogical analysis. Far from being the universal structure of the unconscious, Oedipus is the result of the particular confluence of capitalism and the privatisation of the family that occurs under capitalism (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 51–271). Given the thoroughness of their critique and the delimitation of\n\nthe wolf -ma n’s pa ss-word s | 29 psychoanalysis in Anti-Oedipus, it is somewhat surprising that they would return to the same ground (albeit briefly) in A Thousand Plateaus’ ‘One or Several Wolves’. Indeed in the ‘Preface to the Italian Edition of A Thousand Plateaus’, Deleuze claims that while Anti-Oedipus was intended to be ground-clearing work of critique, A Thousand Plateaus seeks to use that cleared ground in order to build something new (Deleuze 2006: 308–11). What, then, do Deleuze and Guattari gain by returning to psychoanalysis in this plateau? Or, perhaps better, what do they create on this cleared ground? A multiplicity. The turn to multiplicities is signalled in the very title of the plateau, which echoes a question that Deleuze poses in his 1966 study of Bergson: ‘in what sense can one get beyond the ontological alternative of one/several?’ (Deleuze 1991a: 49). A multiplicity is what lies beyond the ontological alternative of one or several.\n\nHow to avoid dialectics In what sense, though, is multiplicity beyond the alternative of one or several? It is a testament to how deeply embedded this alternative is that it is natural to assume that ‘multiplicity’ is simply a synonym for ‘several’. This is a tempting way to read this plateau. Freud was foolish to work so hard to reduce the several wolves of the Wolf-Man’s dream to one, when it is clear that there are, in fact, several wolves. Six or seven, if one believes the initial account of the dream. Five, if one believes the Wolf-Man’s drawing. To be sure, there is a criticism here of Freud’s mania to reduce several wolves to one wolf. It is only by means of this reduction that the Wolf-Man’s neurosis can be organised in accordance with Oedipal representation. ‘There aren’t several wolves. There is only one wolf, and it’s your father.’ However, the force of Deleuze and Guattari’s criticism here is not simply to insist on the obvious several-ness of the wolves in the dream in opposition to Freud’s reduction. The reason for this is that ‘one’ and ‘­several’ are just two sides of the same coin. If we return to Deleuze’s Bergsonism, we can see why this is the case. For Bergson, one/several is a false choice constructed out of concepts that are too vague to be helpful, ‘like baggy clothes’ or ‘a net so slack that everything slips through’ (Deleuze 1991a: 49). It makes no difference whether one begins with ‘one’ or ‘several’. Each is equally vacuous and generates its equally vacuous opposite. This vacuity is precisely why Freud is able to perform his reduction from several wolves to one. At this level of vagueness one can easily be shown to be several, and several can easily be shown to be one. Bergson’s solution to the lack of precision generated by a dialectic of one/several is to eliminate it altogether in favour of ‘multiplicities’.\n\n30 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y Multiplicities are not generated through negation; they do not generate a higher unity through sublation; they do not have opposites. Deleuze and Guattari write, In A Thousand Plateaus, our commentary on the Wolf-Man (‘one or several wolves’) waves good-bye to psychoanalysis and tries to show how multiplicities cannot be reduced to the distinction between the conscious and the unconscious, nature and history, body and soul. Multiplicities are reality itself. They do not presuppose a unity of any kind, do not add up to a totality, and do not refer to a subject. Subjectivations, totalisations, and unifications are in fact processes which are produced and appear in multiplicities. (Deleuze 2006: 310)\n\nThere are two important things to note about this passage. The first is that all of the opposing pairs (conscious/unconscious, nature/history, body/ soul) listed here are simply versions of the one/several dialectic. Depending on the philosopher, either side of the opposition can be ‘one’ to the other side’s ‘several’. The second thing to note is the way in which Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘problematic’ view of philosophy comes to the fore here (Smith 2012: 290–9; Duffy 2013: 1–2). In A Thousand Plateaus this comes up in numerous ways, but here we can illustrate it using the history of mathematics. In the history of mathematics Archimedes champions the problematic view of geometry, which is distinguished from the axiomatic view of geometry championed by Euclid (ATP 364–9). The distinction between the two can be summarised in the question, Which comes first, roundness or the circle? Is the rounded line a deficient circle, or is the circle a special instance of roundness? Euclidean geometry argues that the circle comes first. All other curvilinear shapes are deviations from the circle. Or, in the terms we have already used, rounded lines are the several to the circle’s one. For Archimedes, there is only roundness. Roundness does not add up to anything, nor is it a fragment of some lost whole. There are only rounded lines interacting with other rounded lines. Sometimes these interacting rounded lines temporarily form into circles or other unities, but any unity (in the language of Anti-Oedipus) is a residuum of a process, not its goal or ground (Deleuze and Guattari 1983: 20). The replacement of the one/several dialectic with a problematic rather than axiomatic methodology gets to the heart of Deleuze and Guattari’s project in A Thousand Plateaus and the trajectory of Deleuze’s career as a whole. The project is fundamentally creative, designed to create new concepts. The project is fundamentally experimental, testing and expanding on minority hypotheses abandoned and scattered throughout history. In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari refer to this methodology as a ‘perceptual semiotics’ (ATP 23; Adkins 2015: 1–20). What they are trying\n\nthe wolf -ma n’s pa ss-word s | 31 to avoid here is an ontological dualism in which the world is divided up into two distinct kinds of things, rounded lines and circles, things subject to a dialectic and multiplicities, for example. Instead they acknowledge that since everything can be seen as rounded lines or seen as circles, seen as multiplicities or seen as subject to a dialectic, the fundamental question is, Which kind of seeing is more likely to result in the creation of something new? Deleuze and Guattari’s contention is that seeing problematically, seeing roundness, seeing multiplicities is more likely to produce something new. In the case of the Wolf-Man, as we will see below, producing the new entails seeing the ‘pass-words’ underneath his ‘order-words’, which Deleuze and Guattari discuss in ‘Postulates of Linguistics’ (ATP 110).\n\nMultiplicities The tempting question to ask at this point is, What is a multiplicity? The problem with this question is that it supposes that we could define a set of essential characteristics that would allow us to distinguish multiplicities from non-multiplicities. But, as we have seen, Deleuze and Guattari’s entire project is predicated on the perceptual semiotics of seeing everything as a multiplicity, so the kind of ontological dualism generated by questions of essence is eliminated from the outset. If everything is seen as a multiplicity, doesn’t everything become ‘the night in which all cows are black’? Aren’t Deleuze and Guattari guilty of the charge that Alain Badiou levels against Deleuze that his philosophy produces a monotonous sameness (Badiou 2000: 14–18)? This charge, however, confuses ontology and epistemology. The ontology of all of Deleuze’s work (with or without Guattari) is univocal. That is, regardless of the object one is talking about, it exists in exactly the same way as any other object. All multiplicities are in the same way. However, it does not follow from the univocity of being that everything is indifferently the same. In fact, the univocity of being is precisely that which makes possible the distinction among different multiplicities. Only insofar as multiplicities exist in the same way can they also be said to actually differ from one another. In contrast to this, an equivocal view of being can never affirm real difference. It can only produce analogical difference. That is, everything will both resemble and fail to resemble everything else to a certain degree, but whether things actually differ becomes unknowable (Deleuze 1990b: 179–80; Adkins and Hinlicky 2013: 68–72; Widder 2001). Supposing, then, for the sake of experiment that there are only multiplicities and that they all exist in the same way, how can we distinguish among them without denying the univocity of being? Deleuze answers\n\n32 | a thousand pl ateaus a n d ph ilo s o ph y this question by noting that since the invention of the term ‘multiplicity’ by the mathematician Bernhard Riemann, various thinkers (including Bergson and Russell) have posited two kinds of multiplicities. Riemann posited discrete and continuous multiplicities, Bergson posited extended and durational multiplicities, and Russell posited qualitative and quantitative multiplicities (ATP 32–3, 484; Deleuze 1991a: 38–43; Duffy 2013: 89–115). In this context, Deleuze and Guattari write, We are doing approximately the same thing when we distinguish between arborescent multiplicities and rhizomatic multiplicities . . . On the one hand, multiplicities that are extensive, divisible, and molar; unifiable, totalisable, organisable; conscious or preconscious – and on the other hand, libidinal, unconscious, molecular, intensive multiplicities composed of particles that do not divide without changing in nature . . . The elements of this second kind of multiplicity are particles . . . their quantities are intensities, differences in intensity. (ATP 33)\n\nThe obvious problem here is that dividing multiplicities into two types seems to reinstall the ontological dualism that multiplicity was designed to overcome in the first place. Deleuze and Guattari are aware of this difficulty and say as much: ‘There is no question, however, of establishing a dualist opposition between the two types of multiplicities . . . that would be no better than the dualism between the One and the [several]’ (ATP 34). Even if they are explicit about wanting to avoid a dualism of multiplicities, how do they actually avoid it? As we saw above in our discussion of perceptual semiotics, the key here is to avoid assuming an exclusive disjunction between intensive and extensive multiplicities. The goal is not to group everything into one category or the other. Rather, I think it is much more helpful to think about the distinction between multiplicities as opposed tendencies on an ontologically univocal continuum. That is, any given assemblage will be some heterogeneous ratio of multiplicities with tendencies towards both the intensive and the extensive, towards stasis and change, the rhizomatic and the arborescent. There are no pure rhizomes any more than there are pure trees. There are only mixtures and tendencies. ‘There are only multiplicities of multiplicities forming a single assemblage, operating in the same assemblage . . . Trees have rhizome lines, and the rhizome points of arborescence’ (ATP 34). That is, even in assemblages where the tendency towards arborescence dominates, rhizomatic tendencies will remain.\n\nHow to avoid masses If we suppose, then, that A Thousand Plateaus is a metaphysics of multiplicities, how does that inform Deleuze and Guattari’s analysis in ‘One or\n\nthe wolf -ma n’s pa ss-word s | 33 Several Wolves’? Ultimately, their critique of Freud hinges on a distinction between two possible tendencies of a multiplicity: mass and pack. These tendencies in turn compose assemblages. The distinction between mass and pack is drawn from Elias Canetti’s Crowds and Power, but as with most of their sources Deleuze and Guattari transform Canetti here, as well. For Canetti, the pack is the more primordial kind of group and the mass (or crowd) is a later development (Canetti 1978: 93). For Deleuze and Guattari, though, both are equiprimordial. There are no masses without packs and no packs without masses. Or, better, for any given assemblage there will be tendencies towards mass and tendencies towards pack. Freud’s problem is not that he sees tendencies towards mass (Oedipus, the father, extensive, representational, arborescent, etc.) but that he sees only masses. Even when he is presented with a pack tendency (dreams, intensive, rhizomatic, etc.), he is determined to turn it into a mass. Once Freud converts the pack into a mass he declares the Wolf-Man cured. Deleuze and Guattari argue that one can only see what is new in the Wolf-Man insofar as one sees both tendencies. ‘In the case of the Wolf-Man, it is impossible to separate the becoming-wolf of his dream from the military and religious organisation of his obsessions . . . There are not two multiplicities or two machines; one and the same machinic assemblage produces and distributes the whole . . .’ (ATP 34; Holland 2013: 93–6). The complexity of the Wolf-Man’s assemblage becomes clear in 1926, twelve years after he is declared ‘cured’ by Freud. After becoming increasingly obsessed with a bump on his nose, he returns to analysis with one of Freud’s students, Ruth Mack Brunswick. The Wolf-Man still dreams of wolves, but the dream has changed.
