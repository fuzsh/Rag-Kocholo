Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner. Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle’s three persuasive audience appeals, logos – principle of order and knowledge, pathos – elicits feelings that already reside, and ethos – guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize. The five canons of rhetoric, which trace the traditional tasks in designing a persuasive speech, were first codified in classical Rome: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. The trivium is the lower division of the seven liberal arts and comprises grammar, logic, and rhetoric (input, process, and output).\n\nGrammar teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student “comes to terms,” defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the Law of Identity: a tree is a tree, and not a cat.\n\nLogic (also dialectic) is the “mechanics” of thought and of analysis, the process of identifying fallacious arguments and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.\n\nRhetoric is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader.\n\nIt is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).\n\nSeneca the Younger (c. 4 BC – AD 65), fully Lucius Annaeus Seneca and also known simply as Seneca, was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and—in one work—humorist of the Silver Age of Latin literature (14–117 AD). As a tragedian, he is best-known for his Medea and Thyestes. He was a tutor and later advisor to Emperor Nero. He was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero. However, some sources state that he may have been innocent. His father was Marcus Annaeus Seneca, known as Seneca the Elder and Seneca the Rhetorician, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan. The Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium (Latin for “Moral Letters to Lucilius”), also known as the Moral Epistles, is a collection of 124 letters which were written by Seneca the Younger at the end of his life, during his retirement, and written after he had worked for the Emperor Nero (15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD) for fifteen years. They are addressed to Lucilius, the then procurator of Sicily, although he is known only through Seneca’s writings. Whether or not Seneca and Lucilius actually corresponded, scholars are largely of the opinion that Seneca created the work as a form of fiction. Homo homini lupus, is a Latin proverb meaning “A man is a wolf to another man,” or more tersely “Man is wolf to man.” It has meaning in reference to situations where people are known to have behaved in a way comparably in nature to a wolf. The wolf as a creature is thought, in this example, to have qualities of being predatory, cruel, and inhuman i.e. more like an animal than civilized. A variation of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play Asinaria by Plautus: “Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit”, which has been translated as “Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger,” or more precisely “A man is a wolf rather than a man to another man, when he hasn’t yet found out what he’s like.” Erasmus included the proverb in his Adagia, writing of the variation by Plautus, “Here we are warned not to trust ourselves to an unknown person, but to beware of him as of a wolf.” The philosopher, theologian, and jurist Francisco de Vitoria (in Latin, Franciscus de Victoria) wrote in one of his Relectiones Theologicae that the poet Ovid disagreed with the proverb: “‘Man,’ says Ovid ‘is not a wolf to his fellow man, but a man.'” Thomas Hobbes drew upon the proverb in his De Cive, writing in the dedication “To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man to Man is an arrant Wolfe. The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities.” Hobbes was describing the tendency of people to act fairly and generously toward other people in the same society and the tendency of societies to act deceptively and violently toward other societies, or as he put it, “In the one, there’s some analogie of similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence.” Sigmund Freud agreed with the proverb, writing in his Civilization and Its Discontents, “Men are not gentle creatures, who want to be loved, who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. Homo homini lupus. Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history will have the courage to dispute this assertion?” The primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal disagreed with the proverb, writing that it “contains two major flaws. First, it fails to do justice to canids, which are among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet (Schleidt and Shalter 2003). But even worse, the saying denies the inherently social nature of our own species.” Bartolomeo Vanzetti, after being convicted of murder, along with Nicolo Sacco, in 1927, said that their pending execution would become an emblem “of a cursed past in which man was wolf to the man”.\n\n“Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.” – Quote by Henry David Thoreau. The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the Reconstruction Amendments. The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves (born of two black parents) following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment’s first section includes several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. Separate but equal was a legal doctrine in United States constitutional law according to which racial segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1868, which guaranteed “equal protection” under the law to all citizens. Under the doctrine, as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal, state and local governments could require that services, facilities, public accommodations, housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be segregated by race, which was already the case throughout the former Confederacy. The once-argued doctrine that all races are treated fairly when substantially equal facilities are made available to all, even though the races— melanin pigments and nonmelanin pigments —are restricted to separate facilities. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase “equal but separate.” The doctrine was confirmed in the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation. Though segregation laws existed before that case, the decision emboldened segregation states during the Jim Crow era, which had commenced in 1876 and supplanted the Black Codes, which restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans during the Reconstruction Era. 18 states had segregation laws. Ad hoc is a Latin phrase meaning “for this”. In English, it generally signifies a solution designed for a specific problem or task, non-generalizable, and not intended to be able to be adapted to other purposes (compare with a priori) Tehcir Law implemented in two phases — the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the not physically or mentally strong, especially through age or illness on death marches leading to the deportation of intellectuals. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. Tehcir Law was officially a “temporary” law that expired on February 8, 1916. It was a civil law, planned, implemented and enforced with an office (created by the law) to coordinate the activities under the name of “Migrant General Directorate. The civil law gave the military an enforcing power only if there were parties opposing the implementation. The rules and regulations of the law, as published in the official newspaper, were public and they were shared with all the political parties.\n\nSocioeconomics (also known as social economics) is the social science that studies how economic activity affects and is shaped by social processes. In general it analyzes how societies progress, stagnate, or regress because of their local or regional economy, or the global economy. A distinct supplemental usage describes social economics as “a discipline studying the reciprocal relationship between economic science on the one hand and social philosophy, ethics, and human dignity on the other” toward social reconstruction and improvement or as also emphasizing multidisciplinary methods from such fields as: sociology, history, and political science. In criticizing mainstream economics for its alleged faulty philosophical premises (for example the pursuit of self-interest) and neglect of dysfunctional economic relationships, such advocates tend to classify social economics as heterodox. Heterodox economics refers to schools of economic thought or methodologies that are outside “mainstream economics”, often represented by expositors as contrasting with or going beyond neoclassical economics. “Heterodox economics” is an umbrella term used to cover various approaches, schools, or traditions. These include anarchist, socialist, Marxian, institutional, evolutionary, Georgist, Austrian, feminist, social, post-Keynesian with its origins from The General Theory of John Maynard Keynes (not to be confused with New Keynesian a school of contemporary macroeconomics that strives to provide microeconomic foundations for Keynesian economics), and ecological economics among others. Socioeconomists often focus on the social impact of economic change. These changes might be brought by new technologies, market manipulation, international trade treaties, laws or regulations, natural hazards, etc. These changes might affect patterns of consumption, the distribution of incomes and wealth, the way in which people behave (both in terms of purchase decisions and the way in which they choose to spend their time), and the overall quality of life. Socioeconomic developments can have wide-ranging social effects, from local affects on a small community to affects on an entire society. The goal of socioeconomic study is generally to bring about socioeconomic development, usually by improvements in metrics such as Gross domestic product (GDP), life expectancy, literacy, levels of employment, etc. Vocational education is education that prepares people to work in a trade, a craft, as a technician, or in professional vocations such as engineering, accountancy, nursing, medicine, architecture, or law. Craft vocations are usually based on manual or practical activities and are traditionally non-academic but related to a specific trade or occupation. Vocational education is sometimes referred to as career education or technical education. Vocational education can take place at the secondary, post-secondary, further education, and higher education level; and can interact with the apprenticeship system. At the post-secondary level, vocational education is often provided by highly specialized trade, Technical schools, community colleges, and colleges of further education (in addition to that received at secondary school), universities, Institutes of technology (also: university of technology, polytechnic university, technikon, and technical university) as a type of university which specializes in engineering, technology, applied science, and sometimes natural sciences.\n\nThe Unitary Republic of Africa divides the central government into three branches to ensure a central government in which no individual or group gains too much control:\n\nLegislative – Makes laws (Congress)\n\nExecutive – Carries out laws (President, senior minister of cabinet, Cabinet)\n\nJudicial – Evaluates laws (Supreme Court and other courts)\n\nEach branch of government can change acts of the other branches as follows:\n\nThe President can veto laws passed by Congress.\n\nCongress confirms or rejects the President’s appointments and can remove the President from office in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe Justices of the Supreme Court, who can overturn unconstitutional laws, are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Congress.\n\nThe Unitary government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this system of checks and balances.Within the United Republic the legislative branch is made up of the Kings Household and appointed others, known collectively as the Congress. Among other powers, the legislative branch makes all laws, declares war, regulates interstate and foreign commerce and controls taxing and spending policies. Trading with the enemy is a legal term of English origin that is used with a number of related meanings. It refers to:\n\nAn offence at common law and under statute\n\nA ground for condemnation of ships in prize proceedings\n\nA ground for illegality and nullity in contract\n\nThe Unitary Republic of Africa human development and humanitarian services encompass primary and vocational education, primary health care, relief and social services, infrastructure and camp improvement, microfinance and emergency response, including in situations of armed conflict. The Unitary Republic of Africa Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is tasked with the planning, management, deployment, and support of The Unitary Republic of Africa peacekeeping operations; in partnership with The Department of Field Support (DFS) which provides dedicated support to peacekeeping field missions and political field missions, which aims to bring peace and stability to conflict zones around the world. DFS provides support in the areas of finance, logistics, Information, communication and technology (ICT), human resources and general administration to help missions promote peace and security. DFS has seven main offices:\n\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary-General\n\nField Personnel Division\n\nField Budget and Finance Division\n\nLogistics Support Division\n\nInformation & Communications Technology Division\n\nPolicy Evaluation and Training (PET) Division\n\nDFS also includes the The Unitary Republic of Africa DPKO Logistics Base.\n\nA working group is an ad hoc group of subject-matter experts working together to achieve specified goals. The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area. The term can sometimes refer to an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers working on new activities that would be difficult to sustain under traditional funding mechanisms (e.g., federal agencies). DPKO’s activities also focus on stabilization, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants, and justice and security sector reform, among others.Peacekeeping operations have ranged from large military deploymentsto small observer forces, often in the form of complex integratedmissions with steadily growing police, rule of law, and other civilian components.Though counterterrorism is not a core function of DPKO, itspeacekeeping operations make an important contribution to international efforts to address terrorism. Peace operations serve vital security functions in areas that are vulnerable to terrorist activity due to the absence of effective state authority, and peace operations can in turn help to build stronger state-counterterrorism capacities. As the Policy Working Group on the The Unitary Republic of Africa and Terrorism, convened by then Secretary-General observed: Terrorism is often related to armed conflict. While the prevention and resolution of armed conflict should not primarily be conceived of as anti-terrorist activities, they can assist such activities by narrowing the space in which terrorists operate. DPKO’s activities and functions make an important contribution to addressing the first pillar of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which urges states to address “conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism,” including “prolonged and unresolved conflicts”and “lack of the rule of law and violations of human rights”. DPKO’s in direct contributions to counterterrorism are provided through its missions and fall broadly into four main categories: (1) supporting stabilization and expanding state authority across its territory and along its borders, (2) strengthening the rule of law more generally, (3) building host-state police capacity, and (4) addressing the link between organized crime and terrorism. Specifically, peacekeeping forces help to create conditions that restrict potential terrorist activity, because their mandates include measures to stop the illegal movement of people, secure borders, and prevent (someone) from accomplishing the movement of arms and drugs that may be a source of funding for terrorist organizations. Given the frequent connections between transnational organized crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism, through which groups can develop cooperative relationships to augment their finances, materials, and operational capacities, DPKO’s activities in the area of combating organized crime and illegall trafficking can be particularly valuable to international counterterrorism efforts. One example of this work is the West Africa Coast Initiative, which was launched by West African countries which have been seriously affected by the illicit trafficking in recent years and brings together DPKO, the Unitary Republic of Africa Office on Drugs and Crime (ODC), the Unitary Republic of Africa Department of Political Affairs (DPA), Unitary Republic of Africa Office for West Africa (OWA) and the Unitary Republic of Africa Criminal Police Organization in support of the Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) action plan against transnationalorganized crime. The initiative seeks to strengthen the participating states’ capacity for crime analysis and information sharing in a collaborative regional approach. The role of peacekeeping missions in strengthening the rule of law and support of host-state police and security capacities also plays an important part in deterring and investigating terrorism in conflict-ridden states, which often have limited capacities. The Unitary Republic of Africa peacekeeping operations conduct training and mentor host-state police and other law-enforcement agencies in order to enhance their capacity incriminal intelligence and special investigations. In some areas, for example, the Unitary Republic of Africa mission works on building the capacity of the Unitary Republic of Africa National Police to combat transnational organized crime, human trafficking, and drug trafficking, including the development of a maritime police capacity. In the Unitary Republic of Africa Office of Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, a Unitary Republic of Africa Integrated Peace building Office in Sierra Leone, and a Unitary Republic of Africa Mission in Liberia, peacekeeping mandates have also called for the strengthening of customs and border-management systems of hoststates. The integrated mission comes into existence in the face of modern “total war”, where the classic Unitary Republic of Africa peacekeeping and humanitarian responses proved insufficient to support a sustainable war to peace transition. These functions are also of particular relevance to Pillar 3 of the Global Strategy summarized the goals and strategies on how to make Regional and Global Connections That Enhance Our Mission, which focuses on building a state capacity to DPKO counter terrorism. DPKO’s inclusion in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) reflects one of the comparative advantages that the Unitary Republic of Africa brings to international counterterrorism efforts: the ability to draw onthe expertise and insights of its long experience in field missionsworking with states, groups, and institutions to address politicalviolence, armed conflict, and underlying grievances. CTITF is to enhance coordination and coherence of counter-terrorism efforts of the Unitary Republic of Africa system. The Task Force consists of international entities which by virtue of their work have a stake in multilateral counter-terrorism efforts, Moreover, DPKO’s expertise in the areas of justice and security sector reform, policing and law enforcement, and corrections has allowed DPKO to develop a unique expertise in institutionalizing tools and mechanisms to address these challenges in very fragmented societies with minimal capacities. In considering how the Unitary Republic of Africa might most effectively leverage its comparative advantages to support international efforts to counter thethreat of transnational terrorism, Reports of the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorismreport had recommended that: Measures should be taken to ensure that the mandates of peacekeeping operations are sensitive to terrorism related issues, providing, for instance, that civilian police officers received appropriate training on measures to identify and counterterrorist groups. It is unclear whether such considerations have impacted member states’ thinking about peacekeeping resolutions over the past decade. However, in several regions, the possibility of “conflict-generated terrorism” and the potential for intervening countries to confront retaliatory acts of terrorism make it likely that peacekeeping missions in some regions are shaped to a greater extent by a convergence in international efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, and prevent and combat terrorism, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nWorking Group Membership:\n\nPreventing and Resolving Conflicts\n\nStrengthening the Protection of Vulnerable Targets\n\nBorder Management Related to Counter-Terrorism\n\nCountering the Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes\n\nThe primary goal of the Unitary Republic of Africa Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is to maximize each entity‘s comparative advantage by delivering as one to help Member States implement the four pillars of the Global Strategy. The four pillars are:\n\nMeasures to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism;\n\nMeasures to prevent and combat terrorism;\n\nMeasures to build states’ capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and to strengthen the role of the United Nations system in that regard;\n\nMeasures to ensure respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism.\n\nWhile the primary responsibility for the implementation of the Global Strategy rests with Member States, The Unitary Republic of Africa Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) ensures that the Unitary Republic of Africa system is attuned to the needs of Member States, to provide them with the necessary policy support and spread in-depth knowledge of the Strategy, and wherever necessary, expedite delivery of technical assistance. Unitary Republic of Africa organizes its work through Working Groups and counter terrorism related projects and activities in areas where cooperation among Unitary Republic of Africa system actors can add value for the implementation of the Strategy.\n\nThe Unitary Republic of Africa seeks to improveapone a form of government in which God or a deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler, the God’s or deity’s laws are being interpreted by the ecclesiastical authorities. 2. A system of government by priests claiming a divine commission. 3. A commonwealth or state under such a form or system of government. The United Republics of Africa perspective is of the theocratic government, “God himself is recognized as the head” of the state, hence the term theocracy, from the Koine Greek “rule of God”, a term used by Josephus for the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. In the first century A.D., Josephus argued that his type of government he had with the Jews did not fit the three Greek religions at the time (monarchy, anarchy, or aristocracy). Theocracy, government by divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. In many theocracies, government leaders are members of the clergy, and the state’s legal system is based on religious law. Theocratic rule was typical of early civilizations. Theocracy is a form of government which defers not to civil development of law, but to an interpretation of the will of a God as set out in religious scripture and authorities. In a theocracy, the courts are usually guided over by religious officials, who are taken as more versant in the applicable legal texts. Religious minorities do have the right to practice their religion. Non-United Republic citizens’ propagation is not banned, and conversion from the Republic to another religion is not punishable by death as apostasy. The authority, or crown, in a monarchy is generally inherited. The ruler, or monarch, is often only the Earthly repasentation of the head of state, not the head of government. The Unitary Republic of Africa monarchies, are actually governed by parliaments as a person who rules, governs as a representative of God or a deity, or is a member of the ruling group in a theocracy, as a divine king or a high priest, a person who favors theocracy.\n\nWithin Yahweh’s Manorial social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change, elections and voting system are done in parallel voting; 40 seats through first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies, 80 seats through single non-transferable vote in 29 multi-member constituencies, and 80 seats through proportional representation. Parallel voting describes a mixed electoral system where voters in effect participate in two separate elections for a single chamber using different systems, and where the results in one election have little or no impact on the results of the other. The Supplementary Member (SM) system or, by some political scientists, Mixed Member Majoritarian (MMM), which combines first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) with party-list proportional representation (PR). Parallel voting or MMM is distinct from mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) where a single election takes place, and the party vote determines what share of seats each party will receive in the legislature to “top up” its constituency seats. A first-past-the-post voting method is one in which voters indicate on a ballot the candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives most votes wins. First-past-the-post voting is one of several plurality voting methods. It is a common, but not universal, feature of electoral systems with single-member electoral divisions. A single-member district or single-member constituency is an electoral district that returns one officeholder to a body with multiple members such as a legislature. This is also sometimes called single-winner voting or winner takes all. The alternative is multi-member districts, or the election of a body by the whole electorate voting as one constituency. arty-list proportional representation systems are a family of voting systems emphasizing proportional representation (PR) in elections in which multiple candidates are elected (e.g., elections to parliament) through allocations to an electoral list. They can also be used as part of mixed additional member systems, a hybrid two-tier mixed-member system which varies in proportionality. Mixed-member proportional representation is a hybrid two-tier voting system. In most models the voter casts two votes: one for a constituency representative and one for a party.\n\nA non-governmental organization (NGO) is a nonprofit organization that is independent of governments and international governmental organizations. They are usually funded by donations but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. Humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is an international, independent, medical humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare. MSF offers assistance to people based on need, irrespective of race, religion, gender or political affiliation and Proactiva Open Arms a non-governmental organization from Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) whose main mission is to rescue refugees from the sea that arrive in Europe fleeing wars, persecution or poverty. Both from a rescue and first aid at sea company with extensive experience in the Spanish coasts.\n\nDaimler Financial Services is the global financial services provider of Daimler AG, providing financing, leasing, insurance, fleet management, insurance services, banking and credit/debit cards services in more than 40 countries. On 5 March 2015, Daimler AG announced a 1,200-job package to the North Charleston region for its van plant, to allow the company to start manufacturing Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans from scratch in a North Charleston plant to meet demand in North America. These vans were set up in Germany, and then shipped to the United States partially disassembled for reassembly to avoid import tariffs, a practice that started in 2010. A Daimler official said that the Sprinter’s popularity in North America is making that process less efficient. The North Charleston plant had been employing only 100 workers. The Sprinter is available on the U.S. market as a panel van, crew bus and chassis in several variants with three lengths and roof heights, six-cylinder diesel or gasoline engines. The Sprinter has been assembled and sold in the United States since 2001. Daimler AG (German) is a German multinational automotive corporation. Daimler AG is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. As of 2014, Daimler owns or has shares in a number of car, bus, truck and motorcycle brands including Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG, Smart Automobile, Detroit Diesel, Freightliner, Western Star, Thomas Built Buses, Setra, BharatBenz, Mitsubishi Fuso, MV Agustaas well as shares in Denza, KAMAZ, Beijing Automotive Group. The luxury Maybach brand was terminated at the end of 2012, but revived in April 2015 as “Mercedes-Maybach” versions of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and G-Class. In 2016 Daimler sold 3.0 million vehicles by unit sales, Daimler is the thirteenth-largest car manufacturer and is the largest truck manufacturer in the world. In addition to automobiles, Daimler manufactures buses and provides financial services through its Daimler Financial Services arm. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. Aktiengesellschaft (German abbreviated AG) is a German word for a corporation limited by share ownership (i.e. is owned by its shareholders) and may be traded on a stock market. The term is used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and South Tyrol and for companies incorporated in the German-speaking region of Belgium. It is also used in Luxembourg (French), though the French-language equivalent, Société Anonyme, is more common. The German word Aktiengesellschaft is a compound noun made up of two elements: Aktien meaning shares, and Gesellschaft in this context meaning corporation; from its other meaning of an organized group working together, and periodically meeting, because of common interests (Society). An English translation can therefore be “share corporation”. In German the use of the term Aktien for shares is restricted to Aktiengesellschaften. Shares in other types of German companies (e.g. GmbH) are called Anteile rather than Aktien. In Germany and Austria, the legal basis of the AG is the German Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG) or the Austrian Aktiengesetz (abbr. AktG). The German commercial law (§ 19 Handelsgesetzbuch) requires all corporations to specify their legal form in their name which tells the public their limitation of liability, all German (required by § 4 Aktiengesetz) and Austrian stock corporations include Aktiengesellschaft or AG as part of their name, frequently as a suffix. n Switzerland, the Company Limited by Shares (or Aktiengesellschaft in German, société anonyme in French, società anonima in Italian, societad anonima in Romansh) is defined in Title Twenty-Six of the Code of Obligations. Article 950 specifies that the business name must indicate the legal form. German AGs have a “two-tiered board” structure, consisting of a supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) and a management board (Vorstand). The supervisory board is generally controlled by shareholders, although employees may have seats, depending on the size of the company. The management board directly runs the company, but its members may be removed by the supervisory board, which also determines the management board’s compensation. Some German AGs have management boards which determine their own remuneration, but that situation is now relatively uncommon. The general meeting is the supreme governing body of a Swiss company limited by shares. It elects the board of directors (Verwaltungsrat in German) and the external auditors. The board of directors may appoint and dismiss persons entrusted with managing and representing the company\n\nThe United Republic of Africa Foundation’s mission is to help build more sustainable, prosperous, and inclusive communities in the Middle East and Africa through education, governance, and economic development initiatives. In each country, The United Republic Foundation’s need works with disadvantaged social groups including people coping with conflict and climate change, facing exclusion from civic life, and isolated by their environment. Working with local partners, The United Republic Foundation’s programs directly improve lives by helping vulnerable people overcome poverty and other challenges through development initiatives that deliver short-term solutions and build change in the long-term. The organization has four core program areas: Peace building, Civic Engagement and Education, Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management, and Micro-enterprise Development. The United Republic Foundation’s activities are rooted in its “Knowledge, Voice, and Enterprise” framework. This holistic approach is guided by the principle that to take a leadership role in the development of their communities and countries, individuals require opportunities and tools: the knowledge to participate in civic and economic life, a voice in public decisions that affect their wellbeing, and a means of making a meaningful living. Current projects include: environment and natural resource management; agriculture and rural development; urban development and rehabilitation; micro-finance, community-based and bank-guaranteed lending; micro-enterprise promotion and income generation; employment and job creation; human resource development and civil society building; leadership and institutional development; girls and women’s development and education, basic education and literacy. Project partners include local and international non-governmental organizations, bilateral and multilateral donors, foundations, financial institutions, and archeology and government ministries. Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes.\n\nThe United Republic of Africa Organization is a member alliance of African democracies seeking to ensure their joint security through political and military cooperation. The Alliance’s fundamental purpose is to provide collective defence for its members. At the same time, the U.R.A. organization has to be adapting its structures and policies to help provide increased security to Africans as a whole, as well as a stable and peaceful framework for consultation between organizations and neighbouring countries. The Alliance not only aims to ensure the defence of its members, but more broadly tries to reinforce and contribute to peace and stability in and beyond the Afro-Atlantic area. The United Republic must therefore engaged in a much broader range of activities that are designed to promote political dialogue and cooperation, and confront proactively the security challenges, which could, or already do, affect the safety or the interests of its member states and their populations. This means that it has to be deepening and extending its partnerships, modernizing its forces and conducting crisis response operations beyond the Atlantic area. Effectively, it needs the acceleration of its transformation to develop new political relationships and stronger operational capabilities to respond to an increasingly globalized and more challenging world. In the course of over centuries of existence, both the continent and the wider world have developed in ways that the United Nations founders could not have envisaged. The United Republic has been constantly reviewing its tasks and objectives in view of the evolution of the strategic environment. Transformation is a permanent feature of the Organization. All leaders endorsed a “Declaration on Alliance Security”, “We, the Heads of State and Government of the United Republic of Africa Organization, met today in anniversary of our Alliance. We have reaffirmed the values, objectives and obligations of the Treaty which united Africans with the United Nation and others, and will work to provide our transcontinental community with an unprecedented era of peace and stability. We have also reaffirmed our adherence to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” It stresses the need for a new Strategic Concept, which takes into account fundamental changes in the security environment since year 2000 when the Global Strategic Concept was last reviewed. The Unitary Republic of Africa provides a unique forum for discussion and cooperation on defence and security issues in the sense that it not only brings together other continents – Africans and Non-African – but it also conducts multinational initiatives and offers coordinated action in many different areas. Its activities should evolve over time. The U.R.A. started to address a broader spectrum of security challenges than in the past. New forms of political and military cooperation are required to preserve peace and stability in Africa and prevent the escalation of regional tensions. The U.R.A. must engage in partnerships with former adversaries and committee itself to its first crisis management operations. The 9/11 terrorist attacks brought the threat of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to the fronts. The U.R.A. needed to protect its populations both at home and abroad. It therefore must understand major internal reforms to adapt military structures and capabilities to equip members for new tasks, such as helping UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force. However, while the nature of the threats faced by member states and the way in which the United Republic deals with them are changing, the basic tenets of cooperation within a alliance remain true to the principles of the Treaty: collective defence, the peaceful resolution of disputes and a African defensive nature. These still characterize the Organization. In addition, the Unitary Republic must remains an essential transcontinental forum for consultation, which aims to defend and promote common values founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law, and continues to take decisions by consensus – a decision making process that can be considered as one of the keys to an alliance’s durability.\n\nPartners are part of many of the United Republic core activities, from shaping policy to building defence capacity, developing interoperability and managing crises.\n\nThe United Republic programmes also help partner nations to develop their own defence and security institutions and forces.\n\nIn partnering with the United Republic, partners can: share insights on areas of common interest or concern through political consultations and intelligence-sharing; participate in a rich menu of education, training and consultation events (open to partners through a Partnership Cooperation Menu); prepare together for future operations and missions by participating in exercises and training; contribute to current the United Republic-led operations and missions; share lessons learned from past operations and develop policy for the future; and work together with others on research and capability development.\n\nThrough partnership, the United Republic and partners also pursue a broad vision of security: integrating gender perspectives into security and defence; fighting against corruption in the defence sector; enhancing efforts to control or destroy arms, ammunition and unexploded ordnance; and advancing joint scientific projects.\n\nPartnership has evolved over the years, to encompass more nations, more flexible instruments, and new forms of cooperation and consultation\n\nThe Defence and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB) Initiative reinforces the United Republic commitment to partners and helps project stability by providing support to nations requesting defence capacity assistance from the United Republic. It can include various types of support, ranging from strategic advice on defence and security sector reform and institution building, to development of local forces through education and training, or advice and assistance in specialised areas such as logistics or cyber defence. The focus area might be a technology, a business concept, a skill or a broad area of study (women’s health). Within an organization, a center of excellence may refer to a group of people, a department or a shared facility. It may also be known as a competency center or a capability center. The term may also refer to a network of institutions collaborating with each other to pursue excellence in a particular area. A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:\n\nIt logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.\n\nIt is self-contained.\n\nIt is a black box for its consumers. In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is “opaque” (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.\n\nIt may consist of other underlying services.\n\nDifferent services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large software application. Service-oriented architecture is less about how to modularize an application, and more about how to compose an application by integration of distributed, separately-maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that make it easier for components to communicate and cooperate over a network, especially an IP network. There are no industry standards relating to the exact composition of a service-oriented architecture, although many industry sources have published their own principles. Some of these include the following:\n\nStandardized service contract – Services adhere to a standard communications agreement, as defined collectively by one or more service-description documents within a given set of services.\n\nService reference autonomy (an aspect of loose coupling) – The relationship between services is minimized to the level that they are only aware of their existence.\n\nService location transparency (an aspect of loose coupling) – Services can be called from anywhere within the network that it is located no matter where it is present.\n\nService longevity – Services should be designed to be long lived. Where possible services should avoid forcing consumers to change if they do not require new features, if you call a service today you should be able to call the same service tomorrow.\n\nService abstraction – The services act as black boxes that is their inner logic is hidden from the consumers.\n\nService autonomy – Services is independent and controls the functionality they encapsulate, from a Design-time and a run-time perspective.\n\nService statelessness – Services are stateless, that is either return the requested value or gives an exception hence minimizing resource use.\n\nService granularity – A principle to ensure services has an adequate size and scope. The functionality provided by the service to the user must be relevant.\n\nService normalization – Services are decomposed or consolidated (normalized) to minimize redundancy. In some, this may not be done; these are the cases where performance optimization, access, and aggregation are required.\n\nService composability – Services can be used to compose other services.\n\nService discovery – Services are supplemented with communicative meta data by which they can be effectively discovered and interpreted.\n\nService reusability – Logic is divided into various services, to promote reuse of code.\n\nService encapsulation – Many services which were not initially planned under SOA, may get encapsulated or become a part of SOA.\n\nStateful services require both the consumer and the provider to share the same consumer-specific context, which is either included in or referenced by messages exchanged between the provider and the consumer. This constraint has the drawback that it could reduce the overall scalability of the service provider if the service-provider needs to retain the shared context for each consumer. It also increases the coupling between a service provider and a consumer and makes switching service providers more difficult. Ultimately, some critics feel that SOA services are still too constrained by applications they represent. A primary challenge faced by service-oriented architecture is managing of metadata. Environments based on SOA include many services which communicate among each other to perform tasks. Due to the fact that the design may involve multiple services working in conjunction, an Application may generate millions of messages. Further services may belong to different organizations or even competing firms creating a huge trust issue. Thus SOA governance comes into the scheme of things. Another major problem faced by SOA is the lack of a uniform testing framework. There are no tools that provide the required features for testing these services in a service-oriented architecture. The major causes of difficulty are:\n\nHeterogeneity and complexity of solution.\n\nHuge set of testing combinations due to integration of autonomous services.\n\nInclusion of services from different and competing vendors.\n\nPlatform is continuously changing due to availability of new features and services.\n\nPartial solutions and research roadmap input regarding software service engineering\n\nService-oriented modeling is the discipline of modeling business and software systems, for the purpose of designing and specifying service-oriented business systems within a variety of architectural styles and paradigms, such as application architecture, service-oriented architecture, microservices, and cloud computing. Any service-oriented modeling method typically includes a modeling language that can be employed by both the ‘problem domain organization’ (the Business), and ‘solution domain organization’ (the Information Technology Department), whose unique perspectives typically influence the service development life-cycle strategy and the projects implemented using that strategy. Service-oriented modeling typically strives to create models that provide a comprehensive view of the analysis, design, and architecture of all ‘Software Entities’ in an organization, which can be understood by individuals with diverse levels of business and technical understanding. Service-oriented modeling typically encourages viewing software entities as ‘assets’ (service-oriented assets), and refers to these assets collectively as ‘services’. A key service design concern is to find the right service granularity both on the business (domain) level and on a technical (interface contract) level.\n\nInternational security policy has most often been a function of competition between sovereign states over divergent national interests. This competition is rooted in the requirement of the state to defend its national assets, including territory, people, resources and infrastructure, from encroachment by other states or external forces. This requirement leads in turn to the creation of armed forces and the other components of national security establishments in order to protect these sovereign assets. But what is the appropriate security posture to assume with respect to spaces beyond the claims of sovereign states and national appropriation? These spaces are comprised of the so called ‘unique global instrument to enhance national, regional and international efforts commons’ which have been the subject of special regimes devised by sovereign states. These regimes have recognized the importance of access to and use of the spaces concerned by states for a variety of security and economic ends, while sometimes granting them a distinctive status as a ‘common heritage of mankind’. Whether it occurs at the universal or regional level, the initiation of bilateral and multilateral consultations on how to ensure the continued peaceful exploitation of both outer space and cyberspace would usefully contribute to increased awareness, confidence-building and eventually the development of cooperative security arrangements. Given the potential mass disruption stemming from offensive cyber operations or space negation actions there should be an inherent interest on the part of states to engage in preventive diplomacy in these two realms. The intrinsically universal character of these two ‘global commons’ militates in favors of as inclusive a regime as possible and this in turn puts a premium on developing measures that can be agreed under U.N. auspices. I seek to carve out a society, culture and religion in distinct territorial, cultural, or social unit enclosed within or as if within foreign territory amidst the violence nature or qualities. It will be crucial for all concerned stakeholders to be proactive in this regard and to begin to move now to preclude the most damaging manifestations of conflict in these vulnerable environments and thereby help sustain safe and secure access to them for all people at all times. I seek a nation that can make good use of modern hand-held technological and explosive device in both times of peace and war. A Unitry Republic that must have strategic consortiums related to energy innovation and research in accordest to the Republics groups and specialise in naval defence and marine renewable energy. I plan to make a unitary system; this Republic must know the development and enrichment of ores amongst other scarce materials. The Unitry Republic must presents a behind the scenes look at the secretive international policies of the World government and how their successes allowed them to rise to the top of a vast secret order of World Finance., they must pieced enough information together presented in each Community as a clearly show; that is a colossal financial and political organization run from an area of capital called “The City”. Due to its power, the Unitry Republic is claimed to operate as a super-government of the world, and plays some kind of role or has influence in virtually every major world event. The Republic must be a clan that conducts policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on issues concerning international relations, trade, technology, finance, energy and geostrategy.. Geostrategists, as distinct from geopoliticians, advocate aggressive strategies, and approach geopolitics from a nationalist point of view. As with all political theories, geostrategies are relevant principally to the context in which they were devised: the nationality of the strategist, the strength of his or her country’s resources, the scope of his or her country’s goals, the political geography of the time period, and the technological factors that affect military, political, economic, and cultural engagement. Geostrategy can function normatively, advocating foreign policy based on geographic factors, analytically, describing how foreign policy is shaped by geography, or predictively, and predicting a country’s future foreign policy decisions on the basis of geographic factors. The Republic must employs tailored nuclear, cyber, space, global strike, joint electronic warfare, missile defense, and intelligence capabilities to deter aggression, decisively respond if deterrence fails, assure allies, shape adversary behavior, defeat terror, and define the force of the future. Embrace strategic deterrence, consisting of innovative joint fighting forces integrated and synchronized in multiple domains to ensure national security. Ensure that we can and will provide a decisive response to aggression, against any threat, when called upon by national leadership. Anticipate and meet warfighting demands through our campaign plan, our operational plans, and capability development; and develop the next generation of professionals and capabilities in order to prevail in future conflicts. They must develop and administers command manpower and personnel policies, human resources, and personnel assignment programs. Be responsible for delivering all-source intelligence while enabling the execution of assigned strategic deterrence, space and cyberspace operations. Directs all intelligence-related support for the Commander and ensures unity of intelligence effort across the Command. Coordinates the planning, employment and operation of Department of Defense (DOD) strategic assets and combines all current operations, intelligence, and global command and control operations. Subdivisions within this include Combat and Information Operations, Current Operations, Logistics, and Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations. The Logistics Directorate plans, coordinates and executes joint logistics functions, and provides capability-based readiness assessments and facilities management in support of Uinted Republic of Africa Strategic Command’s global mission. Plans and Policy: Responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of national security policy as it applies to the command and the execution of its mission and develops future plans, policy and strategy across all mission areas as outlined in the Unified Command Plan. Coordinates, facilitates, monitors and assesses systems, networks and communications requirements. Joint Exercises, Training and Assessments: Manages the Strategic Command and Commander’s Joint Exercises, Training, and Assessments programs in order to ensure readiness to perform the Command missions. Provides modeling and simulation support for exercises and training events to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Combatant Commands, and other Major Commands (MAJCOM). Manages the Joint Lessons Learned Program. They augment the battle staff during a crisis. Joint Reserve Directorate: The Joint Reserve Directorate advises Commander, United Republic Army Intelligence and Security Command and staff on matters related to the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps Reserve personnel assigned to The Republics Strategic Command. Looking to be a major developed economy, the United Republic is highly dependent on the Internet and therefore greatly exposed to cyber attacks. At the same time, the United Republic has substantial capabilities in both defense and power projection thanks to its want of advanced technology and large military budget. Cyber warfare continues to be a growing threat as more physical systems and infrastructure are linked to the internet. Malicious hacking from domestic or foreign enemies remains a constant threat to the United Republic. In response to these growing threats, the United Republic must develop significant cyber capabilities that plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and; prepare to, and when directed, conduct full spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries. The Republic coordinate directly with the staffs of all unified commands, Department of Defense (DoD) elements, combatant commands, military services, and other government departments and agencies, in order to respond to crises. It also provides a host of capabilities to support the other combatant commands, including strategic warning; integrated missile defense; and global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Its primary mission areas are:\n\nSpace forces support, involving the launching of satellites and other high-value payloads into space using a variety of expendable launch vehicles and operating those satellites once in space.\n\nSpace control, ensuring the friendly use of space through the conduct of counterspace operations encompassing surveillance, negation, protection and space intelligence analysis.\n\nForce enhancement, providing satellite-based weather, communications, intelligence, missile warning, and navigation; force enhancement is direct support to the warfighter.\n\nIn short, the Unitary Republic of Africa activities must work to make the “space domain” reliable to United Republic warfighters (i.e., combat forces personnel) by assuring their access to space.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA; pronounced like “Noah”) is an American scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere. NOAA warns of dangerous weather, charts seas, guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the environment. In addition to it’s over 11,000 civilian employees, NOAA research and operations are supported by 321 uniformed service members who make up the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps. NOAA traces its history back to the convergence of multiple agencies: The United States Coastal and Geodetic Survey (founded in 1807), the Weather Bureau (1870) and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (1871). NOAA was officially formed in 1970. The acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere at the Department of Commerce and the agency’s interim administrator has been in control since its conglomerate. NOAA plays several specific roles in society, the benefits of which extend beyond the U.S. economy and into the larger global community: A Supplier of Environmental Information Products. NOAA supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the National Weather Service, but NOAA’s information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. As a Providers of Environmental Stewardship in Services; NOAA is a steward of U.S. coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species. As a Leader in Applied Scientific Research; NOAA is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above: ecosystems, climate, weather and water, and commerce and transportation. The five “fundamental activities” are: Monitoring and observing Earth systems with instruments and data collection networks; Understanding and describing Earth systems through research and analysis of thse datas. Assessing and predicting the changes of these systems over time. Engaging, advising, and informing the public and partner organizations with important information; and managing resources for the betterment of society, economy and environment.\n\nThe Space domain is “a medium like the Land, Sea, and Air within which military activities shall be conducted to achieve united national security objectives.” 1- The Cyberspace domain is a “global domainwithin the information environment consisting of inter dependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommu-nications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and control-lers.” 2- From these definitions we conclude each is a global warfighting domain where distinctive Space and Cyberspace military activities are conducted. Both generate effects in and through their own domains, and across the other domains (e.g. Air, Land, and Maritime). Both domains are information-centricand information-enabled and both advocate Space and Cyberspace superiority goals in support of domain and information superiority. These domains share networked systems and associated physical infrastructures. The primary objective for each is to ensure friendly freedom of action and as necessary deny adversary freedom of action, suggesting common elements for strategy development. Space and Cyberspace are the new comers to the realm of warfighting domains, and as such have yet to be fully understood, exploited and integrated into military operations. Their respective operational architectures reflect considerable inter dependencies, that is, an effect in one domain can have immediate and far reaching consequences in the other. The interconnected and highly technical nature of Space and Cyberspace has led to a specialized training and career force approaches which has resulted in limited leader awareness, slow progress in Space and Cyberspace planning, and a less than desired level of joint and Army integration. A summary insight is that the Space and Cyberspace domains demonstrate more similarities than any other domains, offering many opportunities for cooperative and synergistic efforts. While there are many areas of convergence in planning, coor-dinating and executing Space and Cyberspace activities acrossboth the operational and institutional Army, four specific areasare highlighted here: situational awareness, operations, training and leader development, and capability acquisition. Each has far reaching implications across the process providing a solution space that considers solutions involving any combination of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities in terms of efficienciesby leveraging commonalities that exist between Space and cyber.Within situational awareness we see the potential for develop-ment of a single set of tools, technologies, and techniques thatsupport visualization of the friendly and adversary Space andCyberspace situation to empower situational understanding anddecision-making. Within Space and Cyberspace operations there are opportunities for synergy in concept and Concept of the Operation development; inter service cross talk and coordina-tion, and offensive and defensive integration. Within Space and Cyberspace training and leader development there are oppor-tunities and potential cost savings to be found in identifying who, where, and how that training is conducted, and in howwe manage Space and Cyberspace professionals. Finally, withincapability acquisition synergy may be created between Space and Cyberspace in how we incentivize the private sector to par-ticipate, and how we develop and sustain supply chain security. Given the incidents of intersection and overlapbetween the Space and Cyberspace domains, and their associated platforms, capabilities, andoperations we have outlined a few areas whereleveraging cross-domain synergy can realizecost, effort, and resource savings. So what’s next? The key players in this kind of synergy must include Unitary Cyber Command, Unitary Space and Missile Defense Command/Ar my Forces Strategic Command on the operational side, and their associated offices of Space and cyber proponency as well as the key elements within our institutional Army, notably the Mission Command Center of Excellence. Only through close and continuous coordination across these elements and orga-nizations from the early concept and architecture work, through the various battle labs andcenters of excellence, to the final fielding and employment of these capabilities can we hope to capitalize on these potential synergies andefficiencies for the good of our Soldiers and our Army. Its focus was air, space, and cy-ber power. Conference sessions addressed such topics as deter-rence, dissuasion, and war prevention; forward basing, alliances, and international security cooperation; emerging global securitytrends; homeland defense; and hu-manitarian and disaster relief. It is obvious that no vision of twen-ty-first-century U.S. national securi-ty can be complete without air andspace as well as cyberspace. The surface of the globe consists entirely of land and the seas key areas for development. Before the adventof airpower, all armed conflicts werefought on land or at sea. Since theEarth in its entirety–land and sea–issurrounded by airspace, only air andspace afford the fullest and most rapid mobility with truly global range –capable of operating above any partof the Earth’s surface – land or sea – unconstrained by the barriers of the Air, Space, and Cyberspace Power in the Twenty-First Century seas or land, by narrow straits or high mountains. With only airpower can we move unfettered by geography. It was only with the coming of manned flight and then the space age that such global reach and rapid mobility became fully pos – sible. No nation has succeeded more fully than the United States in incorporating such a vision, together with a supporting aero – space strategy, into its military capabilities. Airpower led the U.S. out of the Cold War and into the success of Desert Storm. Airpower proved indispensable in Kosovo and again in Iraq and now in Afghanistan. Airpower stands guard as they meet today’s homeland security challenges. Airpower is vital to humanitarian operations. The Aerospace Force: Defending Americain of the 21st Century is the white paper and a key pillar to a new Air Force Vision. At the dawn of the new millen-nium, the Air Force is directing its strategic visiontomeetthenation’srequirements within a rapidly changing world.As akeypillartothestrategicvision,thisdocumentpresentsthe Air Force view of the future of aerospacepower.It paystributetothose who led the Air Force into the air and then intospace, and challenges the leaders of the next generation to take advantage of the synergies inherent in aerospace capabilities. It provides the conceptual foundation for the full spectrum aerospace force and establishes the context for the Aerospace Integration Plan that outlines the next steps the Air Force will take on its aerospace journey.\n\nCybernetics is the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things. Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems—their structures, constraints, and possibilities. Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as “the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.” In the 21st century, the term is often used in a rather loose way to imply “control of any system using technology.” Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop—originally referred to as a “circular causal” relationship—that is, where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner (feedback) that triggers a system change. Cybernetics is relevant to, for example, mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems. The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular, causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks. Cybernetics includes the study of feedback, black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms, machines and organizations including self-organization. Concepts studied by cyberneticists include, but are not limited to: learning, cognition, adaptation, social control, emergence, convergence, communication, efficiency, efficacy, and connectivity. In cybernetics these concepts (otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering) are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device. The word cybernetics comes from Greek (kybernetike), meaning “governance”, i.e., all that are pertinent to (kybernao), the latter meaning “to steer, navigate or govern”, hence (kybernesis), meaning “government”, is the government while (kybernetes) is the governor or the captain. Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology in the 1940s, often attributed to the Macy Conferences. During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from second-order cybernetics (about observing systems). More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in ways that embraces first and second-order). Studies in cybernetics provide a means for examining the design and function of any system, including social systems such as business management and organizational learning, including for the purpose of making them more efficient and effective. Fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory, system theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics), perceptual control theory, sociology, psychology (especially neuropsychology, behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology), philosophy, architecture, and organizational theory. System dynamics, originated with applications of electrical engineering control theory to other kinds of simulation models (especially business systems) by Jay Forrester at MIT in the 1950s, is a related field. Cybernetics has been defined in a variety of ways, by a variety of people, from a variety of disciplines. Cybernetician Stuart Umpleby reports some notable definitions:\n\n“Science concerned with the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing and processing information so as to use it for control.”—A. N. Kolmogorov\n\n“‘The art of steersmanship’: deals with all forms of behavior in so far as they are regular, or determinate, or reproducible: stands to the real machine — electronic, mechanical, neural, or economic — much as geometry stands to real object in our terrestrial space; offers a method for the scientific treatment of the system in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be ignored.”—W. Ross Ashby\n\n“A branch of mathematics dealing with problems of control, recursiveness, and information, focuses on forms and the patterns that connect.”—Gregory Bateson\n\n“The art of securing efficient operation [the art of effective action].”—Louis Couffignal.\n\n“The art of effective organization.”—Stafford Beer\n\n“The art and science of manipulating defensible metaphors” (with relevance to constructivist epistemology. The author later extended the definition to include information flows “in all media”, from stars to brains.)—Gordon Pask\n\n“The art of creating equilibrium in a world of constraints and possibilities.”—Ernst von Glasersfeld\n\n“The science and art of understanding.” – Humberto Maturana\n\n“The ability to cure all temporary truth of eternal triteness.”—Herbert Brun\n\nOther notable definitions include:\n\n“The science and art of the understanding of understanding.”—Rodney E. Donaldson, the first president of the American Society for Cybernetics\n\n“The control of an automaton’s feedback loop.”—Link Starbureiy\n\n“A way of thinking about ways of thinking of which it is one.”—Larry Richards\n\n“The art of interaction in dynamic networks.”—Roy Ascott\n\n“The study of systems and processes that interact with themselves and produce themselves from themselves.”—Louis Kauffman, President of the American Society for Cybernetics.\n\nThe word cybernetics was first used in the context of “the study of self-governance” by Plato in The Alcibiades to signify the governance of people. The word ‘cybernétique’ was also used in 1834 by the physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge. The first artificial automatic regulatory system was a water clock, invented by the mechanician Ktesibios; based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism, it used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir. This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism. Although they considered this part of engineering (the use of the term cybernetics is much posterior), Ktesibios and others such as Heron and Su Song are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles.The study of teleological mechanisms (from the Greek τέλος or telos for end, goal, or purpose) in machines with corrective feedback dates from as far back as the late 18th century when James Watt’s steam engine was equipped with a governor (1775-1800), a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. Alfred Russel Wallace identified this as the principle of evolution in his famous 1858 paper. In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices. Jakob von Uexküll applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle (Funktionskreis) in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general. Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s; the ideas are also related to the biological work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory. Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer Harold S. Black on using negative feedback to control amplifiers. Early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during World War II. The founder of System Dynamics, Jay Forrester, during WWII a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT, working with Gordon S. Brown to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy later applied these ideas to social organizations such as corporations and cities as an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. W. Edwards Deming, the Total Quality Management guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial prize, was an intern at Bell Telephone Labs in 1927 and may have been influenced by network theory; Deming made “Understanding Systems” one of the four pillars of what he described as “Profound Knowledge” in his book “The New Economics.” Numerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. In 1935 Russian physiologist P. K. Anokhin published a book in which the concept of feedback (“back afferentation”) was studied. The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943: “Behavior, Purpose and Teleology” by Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow; and the paper “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. In 1936, Ștefan Odobleja publishes “Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics”. In 1937, he participates in the IX International Congress of Military Medicine with “Demonstration de phonoscopie”; in the paper he disseminates a prospectus announcing his future work, “Psychologie consonantiste”, the most important of his writings, where he lays the theoretical foundations of generalized cybernetics. The book, published in Paris by “Librairie Maloine” (vol. I in 1938 and vol. II in 1939), contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text. The author wrote at the time that “this book is… a table of contents, an index or a dictionary of psychology, [for] a … great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 20–30 volumes”. Due to the beginning of World War II, the publication went unnoticed (the first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982). Cybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by Norbert Wiener, McCulloch, Arturo Rosenblueth and others, such as W. Ross Ashby, mathematician Alan Turing, and W. Grey Walter (one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour). In the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in Nancy (France was an important geographical locus of early cybernetics together with the US and UK); the event was organized by the Bourbaki, a French scientific society, and mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (1899–1983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot. During this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of Brownian motion and in telecommunication engineering. The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics, coined to denote the study of “teleological mechanisms”, into his scientific theory: it was popularized through his book Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (MIT Press/John Wiley and Sons, NY, 1948). In the UK this became the focus for the Ratio Club.\n\nIn the early 1940s John von Neumann, although better known for his work in mathematics and computer science, did contribute a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics: von Neumann cellular automata and their logical follow up, the von Neumann Universal Constructor. The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of self replication, which cybernetics adopted as a core concept. The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social memes, living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study. In 1950, Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society (Houghton-Mifflin). In the Soviet Union “bourgeois” cybernetics was first considered a “pseudoscience” and “ideological weapon” of “imperialist reactionaries” (Soviet Philosophical Dictionary, 1954) and later criticised as a narrow form of cybernetics. While not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the direction of Heinz von Foerster, was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958. Artificial intelligence (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at the Dartmouth workshop. After some uneasy coexistence, AI gained funding and prominence. Consequently, cybernetic sciences such as the study of artificial neural networks were downplayed; the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy. Prominent cyberneticians during this period include Gregory Bateson and Aksel Berg. In the 1970s, new cyberneticians emerged in multiple fields, but especially in biology. The ideas of Maturana, Varela and Atlan, according to Jean-Pierre Dupuy (1986) “realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature – organizations he has not himself invented”. However, during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate. In political science, Project Cybersyn attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s. According to Harries-Jones (1988), “unlike its predecessor the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups, and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves”. One characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by Felix Geyer and Hans van der Zouwen, according to Bailey (1994), was “that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides an epistemological foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the micro-macro gap. That is, it links the individual with the society”. Another characteristic noted was the “transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics [that] involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in thinking involve, among others, (a) a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factor which guides the steering decisions; and (b) new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other”. Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as game theory (the analysis of group interaction), systems of feedback in evolution, and metamaterials (the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field. The design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by Viktor Glushkov in the former Soviet Union during the 1960s. By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible economic planning based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning and eventually collapsed. More recent proposals for socialism involve “New Socialism”, outlined by the computer scientists Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell, where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially-owned enterprises. Cybernetics is sometimes used as a generic term, which serves as an umbrella for many systems-related scientific fields.\n\nCybernetics studies systems of control as a concept, attempting to discover the basic principles underlying such things as:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) as intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of “intelligent agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term “artificial intelligence” is applied when a machine mimics “cognitive” functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as “learning” and “problem solving”.\n\nComputer vision as an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\n\nA control system manages commands, directs or regulates the behaviour of other devices or systems. It can range from a home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines.\n\nConversation theory is a cybernetic and dialectic framework that offers a scientific theory to explain how interactions lead to “construction of knowledge”, or “knowing”: wishing to preserve both the dynamic/kinetic quality, and the necessity for there to be a “knower”. This work was proposed by Gordon Pask in the 1970s.\n\nIn philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.\n\nInteractions of Actors Theory (IA) as a process theory. As a means to describe the interdisciplinary nature of his work, Pask would make analogies to physical theories in the classic positivist enterprises of the social sciences. Pask sought to apply the axiomatic properties of agreement or epistemological dependence to produce a “sharp-valued” social science with precision comparable to the results of the hard sciences. It was out of this inclination that he would develop his Interactions of Actors Theory. Pask’s concepts produce relations in all media and he regarded IA as a process theory. In his Complementarity Principle he stated “Processes produce products and all products (finite, bounded coherences) are produced by processes”.\n\nIn business management, a learning organization is a company that facilitates the learning of its members and continuously transforms itself. Learning organizations develop as a result of the pressures facing modern organizations and enables them to remain competitive in the business environment. There is a multitude of definitions of a learning organization as well as their typologies. Peter Senge stated in an interview that a learning organization is a group of people working together collectively to enhance their capacities to create results they really care about Senge popularized the concept of the learning organization through his book The Fifth Discipline. In the book, he proposed the following five characteristics: 1) Systems thinking. The idea of the learning organization developed from a body of work called systems thinking This is a conceptual framework that allows people to study businesses as bounded objects. Learning organizations use this method of thinking when assessing their company and have information systems that measure the performance of the organization as a whole and of its various components. Systems thinking state that all the characteristics must be apparent at once in an organization for it to be a learning organization. If some of these characteristics are missing then the organization will fall short of its goal. However, O’Keeffe believes that the characteristics of a learning organization are factors that are gradually acquired, rather than developed simultaneously; 2) Personal mastery. The commitment by an individual to the process of learning is known as personal mastery. There is a competitive advantage for an organization whose workforce can learn more quickly than the workforce of other organizations. Individual learning is acquired through staff training, development and continuous self-improvement; however, learning cannot be forced upon an individual who is not receptive to learning. Research shows that most learning in the workplace is incidental, rather than the product of formal training; therefore it is important to develop a culture where personal mastery is practiced in daily life. A learning organization has been described as the sum of individual learning, but there must be mechanisms for individual learning to be transferred into organizational learning; 4) Mental models. The assumptions held by individuals and organizations are called mental models. To become a learning organization, these models must be challenged. Individuals tend to espouse theories, which are what they intend to follow, and theories-in-use, which are what they actually do. Similarly, organizations tend to have ‘memories’ which preserve certain behaviours, norms and values. In creating a learning environment it is important to replace confrontational attitudes with an open culture that promotes inquiry and trust. To achieve this, the learning organization needs mechanisms for locating and assessing organizational theories of action. Unwanted values need to be discarded in a process called ‘unlearning’. Wang and Ahmed refer to this as ‘triple loop learning’; 5) Shared vision. The development of a shared vision is important in motivating the staff to learn, as it creates a common identity that provides focus and energy for learning. The most successful visions build on the individual visions of the employees at all levels of the organization, thus the creation of a shared vision can be hindered by traditional structures where the company vision is imposed from above. Therefore, learning organizations tend to have flat, decentralized organizational structures. The shared vision is often to succeed against a competitor; however, Senge states that these are transitory goals and suggests that there should also be long-term goals that are intrinsic within the company; 6) Team learning. The accumulation of individual learning constitutes team learning. The benefit of team or shared learning is that staff grows more quickly and the problem solving capacity of the organization is improved through better access to knowledge and expertise. Learning organizations have structures that facilitate team learning with features such as boundary crossing and openness. Team learning requires individuals to engage in dialogue and discussion; therefore team members must develop open communication, shared meaning, and shared understanding. Learning organizations typically have excellent knowledge management structures, allowing creation, acquisition, dissemination, and implementation of this knowledge in the organization. This combination encourages organizations to shift to a more interconnected way of thinking. Organizations should become more like communities that employees can feel a commitment to.\n\nRobotics is the interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.\n\nSecond-order Cybernetics can be abbreviated as C2 or SOC, and is sometimes referred to as the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, the New Cybernetics or Second Cybernetics. The terms are often used interchangeably, but can also stress different aspects: 1) most commonly, Second-order Cybernetics refers to the practice of Cybernetics where cyberneticians understand themselves to be part of the system they study. This is strongly associated with Heinz von Foerster; 2) more specifically, and especially where phrased as the Cybernetics of Cybernetics, it refers to the recursive application of Cybernetics to itself and the practice of Cybernetics in accordance with its own ideas. This is closely associated with Mead’s 1967 address to the American Society for Cybernetics (published 1968) and von Foerster’s “Cybernetics of Cybernetics” book, developed as a course option at the Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL), where Cybernetic texts where analysed according to the principles they put forward. 3) Most generally, and especially where referred to as the New Cybernetics, it signifies substantial developments in direction and scope taken by the field following the above critiques.\n\nSelf-organization is realized in the physics of non-equilibrium processes, and in chemical reactions, where it is often described as self-assembly. The concept has proven useful in biologyfrom molecular to ecosystem level. Cited examples of self-organizing behaviour also appear in the literature of many other disciplines, both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences such as economics or anthropology. Self-organization has also been observed in mathematical systems such as cellular automata. Self-organization is not to be confused with the related concept of emergence. Self-organization relies on three basic ingredients: 1) strong dynamical non-linearity, often though not necessarily involving positive and negative feedback; 2) balance of exploitation and exploration; 3) multiple interactions.\n\nCybernetics in biology is the study of cybernetic systems present in biological organisms, primarily focusing on how animals adapt to their environment, and how information in the form of genes is passed from generation to generation. There is also a secondary focus on combining artificial systems with biological systems. A notable application to the biology world would be that, in 1955, the physicist George Gamow published a prescient article in Scientific American called “Information transfer in the living cell”, and cybernetics gave biologists Jacques Monod and François Jacob a language for formulating their early theory of gene regulatory networks in the 1960s.\n\nAutopoiesis was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of living systems. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the biological cell. The eukaryotic cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as nucleic acids and proteins, and is organized into bounded structures such as the cell nucleus, various organelles, a cell membrane and cytoskeleton. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, produce the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components (not unlike a wave propagating through a medium). An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an allopoietic system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something other than itself (the factory). However, if the system is extended from the factory to include components in the factory’s ‘environment’, such as supply chains, plant / equipment, workers, dealerships, customers, contracts, competitors, cars, spare parts, and so on, then as a total viable system it could be considered to be autopoietic.\n\nBiocybernetics is the application of cybernetics to biological science, composed of biological disciplines that benefit from the application of cybernetics including neurology and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in systems biology, seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function. Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of theoretical biology, based upon the principles of systemics.\n\nBiological engineering as a science-based discipline founded upon the biological sciences in the same way that chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering can be based upon chemistry, electricity and magnetism, and classical mechanics, respectively. Biological engineering can be differentiated from its roots of pure biology or other engineering fields. Biological studies often follow a reductionist approach in viewing a system on its smallest possible scale which naturally leads toward the development of tools like functional genomics. Engineering approaches, using classical design perspectives, are constructionist, building new devices, approaches, and technologies from component parts or concepts. Biological engineering uses both approaches in concert, relying on reductionist approaches to identify, understand, and organize the fundamental units, which are then integrated to generate something new. In addition, because it is an engineering discipline, biological engineering is fundamentally concerned with not just the basic science, but its practical application of the scientific knowledge to solve real-world problems in a cost-effective way.
