Combining breadth and compactness, exposition and critique, and written accessibly and with verve, it ranges across key topics, theories and approaches in film studies. For this new volume, Andrew Dix has thoroughly updated the first edition, writing fresh case studies, tracking and evaluating recent developments in the study of film, and providing the most up-to-the-minute suggestions of books and websites for further reading. The book begins with detailed consideration of film’s formal features (miseen-scène, editing and sound) before moving outwards to discuss narrative, genre, authorship, the star, and film’s ideological engagement (its staging of class, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity). Later chapters on film industries across the world and on film consumption – where and how we watch movies – reflect and assess the discipline’s recent geographical ‘turn’. The book takes a global perspective throughout, illustrating its coverage of the field by reference to film cultures ranging from Hollywood to Bollywood, and from the French ‘New Wave’ to contemporary Hong Kong. Each chapter concludes with a vivid case study, exploring such topics as mise-en-scène in 12 Years a Slave, sound in The Great Gatsby, narrative in Inception and ideology in Blue Is the Warmest Colour. The superhero movie is studied as a genre, and Jennifer Lawrence as a star. Beginning film studies is also fully interactive, with readers enabled in each chapter to reflect upon important questions and to make their own contributions as students of film.\n\nCover images [counterclockwise from top left] Editing machine | Florence Lawrence, c.1908.

While its structure is largely replicated here, this second edition has afforded opportunities in other respects for significant revision and updating. New or expanded case studies have been provided for every chapter. Additional material has been introduced to register and evaluate emerging areas of interest for film studies, including the role played increasingly by social media in film publicity (Chapter 5) and in the fashioning of star personas (Chapter 7). By extending coverage of subjects such as the significance of characters in cinematic narrative (Chapter 4), this edition of the book also offers fuller assessment than did its predecessor of the impact upon film studies of cognitive approaches. Finally, film references and further reading suggestions have been updated throughout.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book would not have been written without the friendship, support and advice of many people in the School of the Arts, English and Drama, Loughborough University: in particular, Brian Jarvis, Paul Jenner and Pete Templeton. For enlightening discussions of film, not least consideration of the star persona of Jennifer Lawrence discussed in Chapter 7, I would like to thank Jen Nicol, Teresa O’Rourke and Tosha Taylor. Much gratitude is owed, too, to David McGowan. Coverage of Bollywood cinema in Chapter 9 benefited greatly from conversations with Aman Nijjer and Anwara Tarafdar. Staff at the Ronald Grant Archive offered guidance in selecting some of the book’s visual illustrations. For help with accessing materials on Loughborough’s cinema history for Chapter 10’s case study, I am grateful to members of staff supporting the Local Studies Reference Collection of Loughborough Library. I am indebted, too, to pioneering research in this subject by Mervyn Gould. Special thanks are owed to Russell Wilson, who provided the diagrams in Chapter 2 of continuity editing’s 30-degree and 180-degree rules. For their great support I am also grateful to Julie Bunce, Bill Kennedy, Cynthia Kennedy, Mandi Ridding, Abi Smith, Andy Smith, Gill Smith and James Smith. The friendship and encouragement of Regula Biggins, Steve Biggins, Frank Mitchell and Julie Mitchell made the writing of the book much easier; it is a great sadness that Steve, always a vivid and funny conversationalist about film, did not live to see publication of this second edition. Working with Manchester University Press has been a consistently happy experience, and thanks are due especially to Matthew\n\nxviii Acknowledgements\n\nFrost for his warm commitment towards this project from the start and to Rachel Winterbottom for inviting me to produce a second edition and for her support during its writing. John Banks has been an exemplary copyeditor, helping to sharpen the argument of the book as well as its presentation and accuracy. The biggest debts are owed to my parents, dedicatees of the first edition, and to Karen Kennedy, dedicatee of this one. Without them, neither version of Beginning Film Studies would have appeared.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe coming of film\n\n‘Then came the film’, wrote the German cultural theorist Walter Benjamin in the 1930s, recalling with excitement the arrival of a new art form at the end of the nineteenth century. For Benjamin, film’s techniques such as slow motion and the close-up held the promise of reconfiguring time and space, thus blowing apart the ‘prison-world’ of previous daily life (1999: 229). In his account, film is not only liberating but a medium that can be differentiated clearly from earlier forms of visual culture. A number of other scholars, however, have taken issue with Benjamin and described the ­late-Victorian emergence of film less as a singular event than as a synthesis and modification of multiple existing technologies and practices. Simply to cite the names initially bestowed upon this art form is, Rick Altman argues, to recognise its conservation and appropriation of what came before, rather than its revolutionary newness: photoplay, electric theatre, living photographs, pictorial vaudeville and so on (2004: 19–20). How long a story should film studies tell about the emergence of the medium with which it is concerned? Although, traditionally, the founding moment was taken to be the Lumière brothers’ first public demonstration of their cinematograph in Paris shortly after Christmas 1895, this is much too straightforward a birth-narrative. Instead, genealogists of film have constructed extensive timelines. For the French director Abel Gance and the American critic and poet Vachel Lindsay, both writing early in the t­wentieth century, film actually descends from ancient visual\n\n2\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nforms like Egyptian hieroglyphics. While Laurent Mannoni does not look back quite so far in his magisterial history of film’s emergence, The Great Art of Light and Shadow, he nevertheless finds an early ‘cinema’ in the experiments conducted by thirteenth-century scholars who projected images in a darkened room by reflecting light from outside through a small aperture (2000: 5). Mannoni’s book goes on to detail a host of technologies of image capture and projection that appeared in succeeding centuries. The best-known of these is the magic lantern (see Figure 1), a device which peaked in popularity during the Victorian period and enthralled spectators by projecting slides of variously picturesque, wondrous and terrifying images upon a wall, curtain or even primitive screen. Many other optical machines, however, also contained in miniature aspects of the future cinematic experience. Consider, for example, the Phenakistoscope, invented in the 1830s and consisting of a disk decorated with pictures which was spun in front of a mirror so as to produce a sense of movement comparable to later cinematic animation. Or, from roughly the same period,\n\n1 A magic lantern, one of film’s precursor technologies\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nthink of the Zoetrope, memorialised in the name of American director Francis Ford Coppola’s production company and comprising a drum rotated at sufficiently high speed for the pictures painted on its interior surface to cohere in a film-like sequence. To explore nineteenth-century visual culture is thus to enter what Michael Wood calls ‘a cabinet of wonders’ (2012: 16), with other fantastically named inventions such as the Photobioscope, Phasmatrope and Praxinoscope also requiring placement somewhere in film’s many-branched family tree. And so, too, do waxworks, dioramas, panoramic paintings, theatre and, of course, photography. The early intertwining of film with other forms that is disclosed here provides a starting point for this book. In recalling this media overlap, however, we do not simply indulge historical curiosity, but witness something that eerily foreshadows the visual culture of our own moment. Much of the twentieth century saw attempts by film criticism and, later, by a more academicised film studies to demarcate securely its object of attention. Enthusiasts and students of film alike sought to identify and evaluate a distinct body of work produced for public delight, excitement and reflection by capturing light on a series of photographic frames and projecting the results so as to generate a sense of movement. Now, however, the assumptions underlying this enterprise are increasingly subject to challenge. In the first instance, as Tom Gunning writes, film is in the process of being ‘dispersed into a number of new image technologies. The last modern art seems to be dissolving into a postmodern haze’ (2000: 317). A moment’s reflection on the irrepressible visuality of contemporary life – at least in economically privileged societies – bears out Gunning’s contention. The primary works with which film criticism has traditionally been preoccupied have unstable boundaries now with a host of other spectacles, including video games, internet sites, TV shows, advertisements and amusement park simulations. Second, major changes to long-established ways of thinking about film are prompted by the progressive replacement of the medium’s photochemical basis by digital imaging. Some of the challenges this latter development poses to familiar areas and protocols of film studies are raised during the course of this book and reviewed in detail in its Conclusion.\n\n4\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nTo dwell at the start of a text such as this upon film’s instability and mutability might seem self-defeating, even suicidal. This is not so, however: the point is simply to acknowledge that now, just as earlier in its history, film studies takes as its object of inquiry something which is messy rather than pristine, in flux rather than fixed, and entangled with other cultural forms rather than self-sufficient. Alain Badiou, one of a number of major French philosophers to have been highly engaged by film, speaks in this vein of ‘the fundamental impurity of cinema’ (2013: 7). Gunning, too, is unfazed by suggestions that film’s ‘contemporary crisis threatens an established sacral identity’; there is, he says, ‘no single identity to guard’ (2000: 327). In the wake of the medium’s own multiplicity, film studies itself should be understood as plural and contentious, not settled or monolithic. Hence, of course, the discipline’s great intellectual excitement and its ongoing life. The invention of film studies\n\nFrom its beginnings, film has precipitated not only sensory stimulation but intellectual inquiry. A significant wave of recent scholarship has returned to the first discourse about film, produced early in the twentieth century, and has registered how it asked fundamental questions about the new medium’s artistic parameters, ideological implications and cultural effects. Was film ‘science or was it art’, for example (Elsaesser and Hagener, 2010: 1)? With respect to audiences, was it likely to ‘elevate and educate, or distract and corrupt’ (1)? Film’s earliest students included major figures from other creative fields such as literature and painting, repelled by its mechanical and chemical constituents but also drawn to it for its exhilarating modernity and for the elasticity of its presentation of time and space. Virginia Woolf was among these founding intellectuals of film, sustaining a complex engagement with the new art form across diary entries and novels as well as, more overtly, in her essay ‘The Cinema’ (1926). And, if a number of writers of fiction and poetry were driven to reflect on film, so too were figures from a background in the visual arts. In the United States, Victor Freeburg, for example, drew at times upon established precepts of art criticism when responding to the new medium in The Art of Photoplay Making\n\nIntroduction 5\n\n(1918) and Pictorial Beauty on the Screen (1923). At the same time, however, Freeburg had to acknowledge ‘a quality of movement in film which was radically different to that of the other visual and plastic arts’ (Marcus, 2007: 215). While early critics such as these prioritised aesthetic ­investigation – seeking to identify film’s distinctiveness as an art form – other writers approached the medium with different concerns in mind. So, for example, Hugo Münsterberg aimed in a pioneering book of 1916 to uncover and analyse the psychological activity initiated by what he continued to call ‘the photoplay’. His interest, as he phrased it, was in ‘the means by which the photoplay influences the mind of the spectator […] We analyze the mental processes which this specific form of mental endeavor produces in us’ (Münsterberg, 2002: 65). The type of psychological inquiry developed by Münsterberg was not always a rarefied intellectual activity in this early period: on the contrary, it was also practised by government agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, anxious about the social effects of the psychological reconditioning produced by film. Hollywood, too, took an interest in this strand of early film scholarship, sensing commercial value in research into exactly what goes on in the spectator’s cortex during the viewing process. An adequate account of the first work on film has to acknowledge, then, that it was characterised by a range of intellectual orientations and carried out by a multiplicity of agencies and institutions. All of this varied activity in the early decades of the twentieth century occurred, however, before the emergence of film studies as a named and demarcated subject area. ‘Film was studied before 1935’, Dana Polan writes, ‘but largely without disciplinary solidification into an academic tradition’ (2007: 19). The first degree in film studies, in fact, was that offered by the University of Southern California from 1933 onwards. While, initially, the student intake on this and some other university programmes in the United States was dominated not by young scholars drawn to the subject for its intellectual challenges but by Hollywood technicians aiming to upscale their skills, film studies gradually disavowed any vocational bias. The subject was also internationalised, emerging as an accredited academic discipline not only in the United States but in such locations as Britain and continental Europe.\n\n6\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nThis is, of course, not the place for a detailed history of film studies. Interested readers can find fascinating accounts of the gradual disciplinisation of this field of study in texts such as Dana Polan’s Scenes of Instruction: The Beginnings of the U.S. Study of Film (2007) and Lee Grieveson’s and Haidee Wasson’s edited collection, Inventing Film Studies (2008). However, two points might be made briefly. The first is to emphasise that, compared with subjects such as history, philosophy, theology and even literary study, film studies as a discipline is relatively youthful. Thus the work on film that readers of this book will do themselves is a contribution to a field not yet as thickly accreted with existing scholarship as some others. Second, it is important not to condescend to early film studies, despite its fragmented and diffuse aspects. This body of work, in fact, holds valuable lessons for us in our own moment, both in the range of projects and approaches it entertained and in its tendency to ask the most searching questions about film’s nature, purpose and effect. About this book\n\nThis volume offers readers a critical introduction to key subjects, concepts and methodologies in film studies. Specifically, it aims to provide: • a knowledge of conceptual shifts in twentieth- and twentyfirst-century film studies • a vocabulary for the analysis of film form and style • a sense of the ideological dimensions of film • an awareness of key post-textual or extra-textual domains of film studies • a prospectus of possible directions for film studies in the future. Running throughout the book is the conviction that film studies is less a single set of orthodoxies for its participants to master and repeat than a field of diverse activities to engage in and extend. At times, it is true, particular critical and theoretical positions have come close to supplying the discipline with received wisdoms. The two strongest candidates to date are the director-centred auteur theory that emerged from France in the late 1950s and early 1960s\n\nIntroduction 7\n\n(discussed in Chapter 6) and the composite of Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist and semiotic approaches that started to form a decade later (discussed in Chapter 8). Even during the period of rule of each of these critical doctrines, however, dissenting voices could still be heard, hinting at other valuable and interesting ways in which to do film studies. The book will assess the benefits of these ‘strong’ conceptual frameworks while welcoming the fact of their relaxation to the point whereby film studies at present is hospitable to a wide range of research projects. The organisation of chapters can be regarded as a set of concentric circles, at the centre of the smallest of which is found the film text itself. Chapters 1–3 assume that knowledge of film’s stylistic repertoire as it has developed from the late nineteenth century to the present is indispensable for any work in film studies (whatever its focus). These chapters aim, therefore, to equip readers with resources for cataloguing and evaluating aspects of mise-enscène (film’s visual field), editing and soundtrack. From early, pre-­ disciplinary days, film studies has understandably been interested in assessing in detail the formal qualities of films themselves. Such narrowing of focus has not been without costs. Charles Acland suggests wittily that ‘the problem with film studies has been film, that is, the use of a medium in order to designate the boundaries of a discipline’ (2003: 46). At times, Acland’s withdrawal of interest from the particularities of film texts is so complete that he resembles a literature professor who has stopped reading books in order to discuss instead the economics of publishing or the design of Kindles. Nevertheless, his critique of an ‘artifactual approach to film’ (52) is bracing, and helps to guard against the kind of formalism that reads a film minutely but has no awareness of the dense contexts of ­production and consumption in which it is enmeshed. If the book’s first three chapters focus closely on film stylistics, Chapters 4–8 move outwards, while continuing to promote detailed engagement with the film text itself. They are concerned respectively with film narrative, film genre, film authorship, film stars and the ideologies – class, gender, sexual and racial – of film representation. In each of these chapters, the text is less a self-enclosed, impermeable thing than a prism reflective of a host of real-world concerns that range from genre’s importance in film industry economics to\n\n8\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nmutations of film authorship in the digital era, or from questions of social power raised by film narrative to cinema’s role in the stereotyping of non-white or non-straight identities. Chapters 9 and 10, however, decentre the film text more thoroughly, along the lines proposed by Acland and some other contemporary critics. For these writers, film studies has now mined the last seams of a textual approach and can renew itself only by other kinds of research. This desire to turn away from ‘readings’ of the primary material and do something radically different is not unique to contemporary film studies. Franco Moretti – whose work on genre features in Chapter 5 – urges a similar change of direction for his own field of literary study. Instead of focusing upon ‘concrete, individual works’ (2005: 1), or restricting itself to ‘separate bits of knowledge about individual cases’ (4), literary criticism in Moretti’s view should take as its proper object of inquiry ‘a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole’ (4). In film studies, systemically oriented work of this type aims to provide ever more detailed accounts of production, distribution and consumption. Extra-textual or post-textual scholarship might focus, say, on the mechanisms by which ‘global Hollywood’ extends the commercial reach of its products, or on the cultural politics of watching films in multiplexes. Chapters 9 and 10 welcome and review these emerging lines of inquiry, while arguing that the best work in film studies will combine savviness about broad institutional forces with sensitivity still to how these play themselves out in the detail of specific films. Three other things should be said briefly at this stage. Firstly, some readers new to the subject may be anxious that film’s manifold pleasures will be lost as a result of cultivating an analytical habit. What happens to the thrill we feel at the kinetics of a chase sequence, or at the star’s beauty on screen, once films are watched in a resolutely critical and theoretical spirit? One (weak) answer is that the absorptive power of much cinema is such as potentially to deflect earnest interrogation until after each act of viewing. However, a stronger response is to emphasise the pleasures bound up in engagement with film criticism and theory themselves – ­gratifications different from sensuous reward by the screen, it is true, but not to be belittled by comparison. As well as introducing a wide range of critical models and theoretical vocabularies, the book includes many\n\nIntroduction 9\n\n‘Stop and Think’ sections that encourage readers to recognise not only the explanatory power but also the intellectual exhilaration of these frameworks. Secondly, a word might be said about the language of film studies. Drawn from such disparate fields as narratology, genre study, Marxist theory, psychoanalysis and so on, the terminology employed by the discipline may sometimes seem off-puttingly abstract. It certainly did to the great Spanish director Luis Buñuel. Given his subversive, Surrealist imagination exhibited across halfa-century of work, Buñuel was hardly a maker of briskly commonsensical films; nevertheless, in his autobiography he tells the story of encountering ‘a young man in a suit and tie’ at a film studies centre in Mexico City: ‘When I asked him what he taught, he replied “The Semiology of the Clonic Image.”’ Buñuel adds: ‘I could have murdered him on the spot’ (1985: 222). But while absorbing the lesson here about a self-regarding or rebarbative jargon, we should not rush to abandon abstract discourse in itself. The critic Peter Wollen puts the case well for film studies’ specialised language: ‘clearly any kind of serious critical work must involve a distance, a gap between the film and the criticism, the text and the meta-text. It is as though meteorologists were reproached for getting away from the “lived experience” of walking in the rain or sunbathing’ (1998: 115). Finally, attention should be drawn to the book’s choice of films to support its discussion. For the most part, the case studies that conclude each chapter are taken from the strain of recent, popular American cinema with which most readers will be especially familiar. This should not, however, be taken as uncritical endorsement of Hollywood’s current global hegemony. Instead, these already known primary materials have been selected so as to facilitate more readily readers’ work with a range of critical models that may be being encountered here for the first time. Elsewhere, however, the book is committed to a wide geographical remit. While regrettable lacunae remain – for example, African cinema both north and south of the Sahara – the films drawn upon across the chapters originate in nations ranging from Spain to South Korea, Iran to Chile, India to Uruguay. Chronologically, too, the book aspires to breadth, aiming not only to be up-to-the-minute but also to venture beyond the recent and contemporary into such earlier filmmaking as the first\n\n10\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nsingle-shot documentaries, the radical Soviet experiments of the 1920s and Hollywood film noir of World War II and its aftermath. A note on references\n\nFilm studies is an activity not only of serious watching but of serious reading. In this spirit the book is dialogical, interacting with many written sources. These are referenced here in author/date style, with the full set of ‘References’ placed at the end of the book. Some of these texts appear also in the annotated lists of ‘Selected reading’ that conclude each chapter. Dates of all films when first mentioned are given in parentheses; where a film appears without a date, this has been supplied earlier. Following the practice of a number of other texts, the titles of foreign films, where these are very familiar in English, are given as such. Again, this is intended only to enhance the book’s accessibility, and should certainly not be read as proselytising for an Anglocentric film culture or a monolingual film studies. Finally, every effort has been made to check the viability of websites listed in the text: all URLs are correct at the time of publication.

However, the American New Critics, influential in mid-­twentiethcentury literary scholarship, are valuable to us in identifying a sin they call ‘heresy of paraphrase’. New Critics have in mind here readings of a piece of poetry or prose which attempt prematurely to say what it means and show, by contrast, little interest in or even knowledge of precisely how it means. Thus the paraphrasing heretic asserts what a Shakespeare sonnet is expressing about true love, but fails to consider how the poem’s thematic implications only emerge through its complex work of versification, rhyme, metaphor and syntax. The result is a disembodied kind of literary criticism, curiously inattentive to the specificities and textures of its own object of study. Much of the discussion of film with which we are most familiar is weakened by similar insensitivity towards the particularities of the medium itself. The reader of newspaper film reviews and the viewer of TV programmes on cinema tend to encounter, precisely, heresies of paraphrase. Such discourse typically summarises a film’s narrative turns, or discusses its characters, but leaves unaddressed its material distinctiveness: its modes of cinematography, say, or its key editing choices, or its layerings of sound. Yet to be concerned with such issues of cinematic form is not indulgent, or somehow minor in relation to more essential things we should be doing as students of film. On the contrary, any attempt to ask larger cultural or ideological questions about a film is inadequate if it does\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n13\n\nnot include some reckoning with the work’s formal dimensions. These visual and auditory repertoires should not be set aside, but, instead, actively explored as devices for the generation of meaning. ‘The meaning of art’, according to two Russian critics early in the twentieth century who were as absorbed by cinema as they were by literature, ‘is completely inseparable from all the details of its material body’ (Bakhtin and Medvedev, 1978: 12). Film’s ‘material body’ is thus the subject of this book’s first three chapters. Before turning in Chapters 2 and 3 to editing and soundtrack, we begin with an account of film’s visual properties, grouped together under the French term mise-en-scène. Defining mise-en-scène\n\n‘What is mise-en-scène?’ asks Jacques Rivette, a key member of the New Wave, that group of filmmaker-critics which energised French cinema in the late 1950s and 1960s. ‘My apologies for asking such a hazardous question with neither preparation nor preamble, particularly when I have no intention of answering it. Only, should this question not always inform our deliberations?’ (Hillier, 1985: 134). While Rivette’s disinclination to define mise-en-scène is alarming, he valuably insists here upon the fundamental importance for film studies of engagement with particularities of visual style. What, exactly, is it that we see and give significance to as we watch films? Consider the start of Sam Mendes’s American Beauty (1999), as a fade-in takes the viewer from a black screen disclosing nothing to a scene abundant in visual information. As the sequence begins, we see a young woman lying on a bed. While this figure remains silent and inert, the spectator begins interpretative work, making provisional assessments of the significance of her location, appearance and posture. Lit harshly rather than flatteringly, the woman is without both make-up and stylish clothing, hinting at some disregard for normative Western femininity. For the moment, we may be concerned just to register and process this sort of visual detail, utilising the categories of setting, props, costume and lighting. To these critical subdivisions should be added that of acting or performance, even while the woman lies motionless. However, our eyes may be more mobile and inquisitive still, taking in not merely the\n\n14\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nfigure on the bed but also the distinctive ways in which shots of her are composed. What are the implications of the camera’s close proximity to her, admitting no other human presence into the visual field? And what seems connoted by the roughened texture of the image itself, shot on grainy video rather than 35mm film? In carrying out interpretative work of this kind on a film’s visual specificities, the spectator is considering mise-en-scène. As Rivette says, however, the term is ‘hazardous’, open to several competing definitions. It translates from French as ‘staging’ or ‘putting into the scene’, indicating its origins in theatre rather than cinema. The theatrical bias of the word is apparent even in the most recent edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, which offers a primary definition of ‘staging of a play; the scenery and properties of a stage production; the stage setting’, but gives no acknowledgement of the appropriation of mise-en-scène as a term in cinematic analysis. The shadow cast by the theatre extends into film studies itself, where some scholars – notably, David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson in their influential Film Art: An Introduction – choose to define filmic mise-en-scène exclusively by what it has in common with theatrical staging: setting, props, costume, lighting and acting. Were we to arrest our analysis of American Beauty after considering such visual properties as the abrasive lighting or the woman’s stillness, we would be doing mise-en-scène work of this circumscribed, theatrically derived kind. But if the spectator goes on to acknowledge and evaluate other information offered to the eye – the camera’s framing of the woman, say, or the video footage’s imperfect quality – then he or she is pursuing instead that more expansive and satisfactory approach to mise-en-scène which embraces not merely the elements cinema shares with theatre but also visual regimes that are distinctive to film as a medium: all those things summarised by John Gibbs as ‘framing, camera movement, the particular lens employed and other photographic decisions’ (2002: 5). This chapter adopts the broader of these two understandings of mise-en-scène. After first discussing the elements that film carries across from theatrical staging, it goes on to consider aspects of cinematography. Even such an expansive definition of filmic mise-enscène is open to dispute as narrow and arbitrary. Jean-Luc Godard, another major figure in the French New Wave, writes with regard\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n15\n\nto a particular editing practice that ‘montage is above all an integral part of mise-en-scène’ (Narboni and Milne, 1972: 39). Bernard F. Dick, in a much-used textbook in film studies, suggests somewhat eccentrically that sound, too, should be accounted an element of mise-en-scène (2002: 19). While sound’s contribution to the sum of a film’s meanings is fundamental – in the scene from American Beauty, a man’s voice from off-camera modifies the sense of isolation that is visually implied – the proposition which Dick makes is one, for the moment, to resist in the interests of isolating the peculiarly visual components of cinema. Similarly, while Godard shows a proper distaste for any approach to film that underplays the effect of combining shots, the approach to mise-en-scène that is elaborated in this chapter still finds it valuable to identify visual elements that may be uncovered even in a single shot and thus to reserve until later the discussion of editing. Pro-filmic elements of mise-en-scène\n\nCoined in the 1950s by the French philosopher of aesthetics Etienne Souriau, the term pro-filmic refers to those components of a film’s visual field that are considered to exist prior to and independent of the camera’s activity: namely, the elements of setting, props, costume, lighting and acting (or performance) which cinema shares with forms of staged spectacle such as theatre, opera and dance. The artificiality of separating these things from cinematography is immediately apparent: Jennifer Lawrence’s looks of concern for her endangered sister in The Hunger Games (2012) – instances of performance, therefore pro-filmic – would not signify so vividly were it not for the film’s close-ups and close shots of her (examples of cinematography). Nevertheless, with the proviso that ultimately they will be reintegrated with cinematography itself, we begin here by separately considering film’s pro-filmic strands. Setting\n\nCinematic settings vary in scale from the vertiginous interplanetary spaces confronting Sandra Bullock at the outset of Gravity (2013; see Figure 2) to the coffin that, patchily illuminated by a cigarette lighter and the glow of his phone, confines the protagonist\n\n16\n\nBeginning film studies\n\n2 Interplanetary space as setting: Sandra Bullock in Gravity (2013)\n\nin Rodrigo Cortés’s Buried (2010). In opulence they stretch from the Roman palaces of epics or the sumptuous interiors of Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) to the hellish lavatory that Renton occupies in Trainspotting (1996). While some film settings advertise their artificiality, others, by contrast, evoke what Roland Barthes calls ‘the reality effect’: at one end of the spectrum, the fantastical Yellow Brick Road in The Wizard of Oz (1939); at the other, teeming city streets that have been exploited throughout cinema history (from brief ‘actuality’ films made in France by the Lumière brothers during the 1890s, through Italian neo-realism of the 1940s and early 1950s, to instances of modern Latin American cinema such as Amores perros (2000) and City of God (2002)). Whether expansive or narrow, magnificent or squalid, artificial or naturalistic, film settings compel our attention. They are not merely inert containers of or backdrops to action, but are themselves charged with significance. At the most basic level, locations serve in narrative cinema to reinforce the plausibility of particular kinds of story. An American urban crime drama would be sterile and unconvincing without the run-down street, the neighbourhood diner, the dimly lit bar; similarly, to guarantee the integrity of its fantastical story-world, Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–3) requires enchanted forests, shimmering lakes and towering precipices. As these brief examples suggest, setting also functions as an index of a film’s generic status. Chapter 5 will return to the question of setting’s role in genre classification; for the moment, we simply note that particular spaces have become a­ ssociated with\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n17\n\ncertain film genres rather than with others. When Sergio Leone’s For a Few Dollars More (1965) opens with an extreme long shot of rocky desert terrain, the spectator can make a reasonable, if still tentative assumption that the film is a western (albeit one that proves to have a playful relationship to the western’s conventions as codified by Hollywood). The fact that in this scene we also observe a lone horseman, looking insignificant against immensities of sand and sky, alerts us to another basic function of setting in narrative cinema: its revelatory power with respect to character. As well as serving in quite obvious ways to specify the geographical co-ordinates and socio-economic positioning of film protagonists, settings may also work more subtly to evoke their psychological condition. Such symbolic use of space is especially vivid in German Expressionist cinema, which flourished after World War I. To take just one example: when the vampiric protagonist in F. W. Murnau’s Nosferatu (1922) is seen in one shot standing behind the latticed window of an apartment block, we learn not just matter-of-factly about his living arrangements, but, more profoundly, of his sense of incarceration by conformist Weimar society. While highly developed spatial symbolism is a signature of this particular cinematic tradition, the spectator should also be sensitive to expressionistic settings elsewhere in film. Props\n\nSetting’s functions of substantiating narrative, signalling genre and revealing character are also performed by props: objects of whatever dimensions that appear on screen. Like particular spaces, certain props are correlated with some genres more than with others (again a topic for development in Chapter 5). If a parachute appears on screen, it is a fair bet we are not watching a western (unless of a surreal sort); if a cigarette flares atmospherically into life in close-up, the film noir fan is liable to experience a greater thrill of anticipation than the devotee of epic. And, like settings, props also perform an informational role in narrative cinema with respect to character. Sometimes this function will be limited to confirming socio-economic and occupational status (a reporter’s notebook, a businessman’s briefcase); elsewhere, however, props may take on expressionistic power. When Travis Bickle drops an\n\n18\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nAlka-Seltzer into water in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976), the fizzing tablet seems not just one tiny component of his material world but indicative of his synaptic disturbance to the point of explosion (this effect enhanced by use of extreme close-up and non-naturalistic sound). Props – or, speaking less technically, things – have also been at the centre of long-running theoretical debates over film’s realism or otherwise as a medium. For key texts in a broadly realist tradition, including André Bazin’s What Is Cinema? (1958–62) and Siegfried Kracauer’s Theory of Film (first published in 1960), cinema shares with photography a vocation to reveal with heightened vividness the material world that we inhabit. From this perspective, the chief value of showing a cigarette or a parachute is to represent it in all its detailed particularity (a vision which, to be sure, may surpass that of everyday eyesight because of the camera’s capacity for close-up). Yet for writers from other theoretical positions, cinema valuably frees objects like these from their material circumstantiality and instead endows them with other, non-realist potentialities. Luis Buñuel deplores the fact that for Italian neo-realists – favourite filmmakers, not coincidentally, of Bazin and Kracauer – ‘a glass is a glass and nothing more’ (Hammond, 2000: 115). In his 1918 essay ‘On Décor’, the French Surrealist author Louis Aragon positively revels in the elusive and multiple significances of film props: ‘on the screen objects that were a few moments ago sticks of furniture or books of cloakroom tickets are transformed to the point where they take on menacing or enigmatic meanings’ (Hammond, 2000: 52). In thinking about the use of props in film, there is no need to be committed exclusively to either of these opposing perspectives. Depending on context, exactly the same object on screen may be a thing valued for its concrete particularities, or its narrative suggestiveness, or its symbolic density. ‘Sometimes’, as Freud is famously said to have remarked, ‘a cigar is just a cigar’; at other times, though, it may be more or other than this (a phallic symbol, most obviously). The television set that figures in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) as an unremarkable detail of a realistically fashioned Middle American home becomes in The Truman Show (1998) an ominous sign of a society of surveillance.\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n19\n\nCostume\n\nLike setting and props, costume, which also includes make-up and hairstyle, has a wide range of functions and significances. Particular garments index historical period, national origin, class status, subgroup affiliation, gender identity, emotional and psychological condition and so on. In addition, costumes on screen may encourage the spectator to make assumptions about a film’s genre. If we see figures wearing space suits, we might reasonably conclude that we have missed the martial arts movie. Similarly, the fact that Bickle in Taxi Driver transgresses norms of costuming – wearing military fatigues incongruous in a contemporary New York setting – suggests that what we are actually watching is a contribution to the sub-genre of the Vietnam War film. Pioneering studies such as Roland Barthes’s The Fashion System (1967) have long habituated us to consider costume as a structured set of signs replete with connotations. Barthes treats each item of clothing as a signifier from which, in quite orderly fashion, particular ‘signifieds’, or meanings, may be read off. To be adequate to the task of assessing costume in film, however, such a semiotic approach needs to be co-ordinated with sensitivity to matters of history and geography. For example, the top hat that signifies a boss’s arrogance and a system of class exploitation in Strike (1924) – a revolutionary Soviet film discussed in Chapter 2 – communicates dandyish lightness and charisma when it is worn by Fred Astaire in 1930s American musicals. In both these instances, costume combines harmoniously with other pro-filmic elements – first with the boss’s corpulence and huge cigar, second with Astaire’s slimness and lithe movement – so as to reinforce already established meanings. However, there are other cinematic cases where costume is excessive in style or colour, thereby clashing with, rather than simply confirming, other aspects of a film’s visual scheme. Jane Gaines argues that certain 1950s US melodramas exhibit such overdevelopment of what she calls ‘the vestural code’ (from vesture, or ‘garment’). Rather like Buñuel and Aragon speaking about props, Gaines welcomes this heightened visibility of clothing in film, its freeing from the relatively mundane functions of supporting the realism of character and story. In these 1950s examples, extravagant clothing hints at desires not otherwise expressible in a conformist milieu. For Alfred Hitchcock, by\n\n20\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nc­ ontrast, such costumes are ‘eye-catchers’ that dangerously distract the spectator from the key task of following narrative line (Gaines, 1991: 203–11). Lighting\n\nIn his remarks on costume, Hitchcock is worried that a pro-filmic element may become autonomous and draw undue attention to itself. Similar concern has sometimes been expressed by film practitioners about the over-promotion of lighting. One technical manual much used by new entrants to the industry states that ‘most skilled lighting is self-effacing. The more subtle the treatment, the more natural or “obvious” it appears to be’ (Millerson, 2013: 236). From this perspective, the ideal film lighting is inconspicuous, contributing significantly to the fashioning of cinematic illusions that absorb the spectator to the point where he or she responds to them as to natural phenomena and fails to recognise their artifice. However, we should resist becoming such critically unaware viewers. Without repressing the pleasure yielded by our vivid sensory investment in the screen, we need also to be attentive to the manifold practices by which this pleasure is generated. These practices include wellestablished lighting conventions. This is not the place to describe in detail film’s uses of key lighting, fill lighting, backlighting, sidelighting, underlighting and top lighting so as to achieve different patterns of brightness and shadow. Anyone seeking specialised technical knowledge of this kind can readily find it in manuals such as Millerson’s. But it is important to note the distinction between two basic lighting schemas in film: high-key (or low-ratio) and low-key (or high-ratio), the latter sometimes called chiaroscuro (a term first applied to Italian Renaissance paintings that included major portions of darkness). High-key describes an even diffusion of lighting across a shot, resulting in low contrast between relatively brighter and darker areas and quite full detailing of what is shown; under a regime of low-key lighting, on the other hand, there is much higher contrast between bright and dark, with less penetrable areas of shadow. If these two lighting types are approached in semiotic fashion as signifying systems, then it might seem as if particular meanings can be straightforwardly attached to each of them. Whereas high-\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n21\n\nkey lighting tends to evoke a sense of clarity and optimism, lowkey lighting, by contrast, may induce feelings of moral ambiguity, anxiety, even terror. Yet, as with the assessment of particular props or costumes, this broad hypothesis needs to be tested in analyses of how exactly lighting functions in specific cases. High-key lighting could, for example, disperse such brightness across a scene as to become monotonous and oppressive, generating a sense less of well-being than of nausea (again The Truman Show comes to mind). Low-key lighting, similarly, may be nuanced or multiple in its effects. Certainly it evokes foreboding where it is deployed, again in signature fashion, in German Expressionist cinema and then in one of Expressionism’s stylistic descendants: classic Hollywood film noir of the 1940s and 1950s. Even in a noirish work like The Big Sleep (1946), however, strongly contrasted light and shade connote mystery and romanticism as much as they do existential dread. And when contemporary noir continues to utilise a low-key lighting pattern, the spectator, far from being thrown into metaphysical crisis, may experience instead a pleasurable nostalgia (consider the value of chiaroscuro in such films as Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For (2014)). Acting\n\nLighting is crucially articulated with the final pro-filmic component: acting or performance (the repertoire of on-screen facial expression, body positioning, gesture, movement and speech). After all, an actor’s facial arrangement that is perfectly adequate for romance in conditions of abundant, soft fill lighting becomes more suited to horror film if it is underlit instead. There have, in fact, been surprisingly few attempts to theorise acting in cinema (discounting those that collapse it into the phenomenon of ‘the star’ discussed in Chapter 7). Some pioneering statements on this topic position film performance against theatre acting and judge it to be impoverished by comparison. Edgar Morin writes of the film actor’s ‘borderline utility’ in the face of cinema’s array of visual and auditory effects (2005: 124). In his important essay, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ (1935–39), Walter Benjamin characterises the film actor as an almost ghostly figure, surviving minimally in his or her two-dimensional screen image but deprived of that vivid bodily presence – or ‘aura’,\n\n22\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nin Benjamin’s language – which the theatre actor communicates to a live audience. It is only slight compensation that the film industry responds to this ‘shrivelling of the aura with an artificial buildup of the “personality” outside the studio’ (Benjamin, 1999: 224). Kracauer, an intellectual descendant of Benjamin, also evokes an existential crisis for the film performer, referring to the ‘decomposition of the actor’s wholeness’, both by different camera positions that fragment the body and by the discontinuous way during shooting in which an actor plays a part (1997: 97). However, there are dangers in assessing film acting by criteria developed for the evaluation of theatrical performance. Here a remark by the American actor Fredric March, who worked on both stage and screen from the 1930s, is instructive. Interrupted by his director during the shooting of one film scene, March apologised: ‘Sorry, I did it again. I keep forgetting – this is a movie and I mustn’t act’ (Kracauer, 1997: 94). From one perspective, this may be evidence of a persistent hierarchy of cultural forms: there is a long history, in the United States and elsewhere, of actors noted for careers in theatre disparaging their work in the supposedly lesser domain of film. However, March’s comment also hints that film acting has conventions which overlap only partially with those of theatrical performance. In his film version of Coriolanus (2012), for example, Ralph Fiennes utilises close-ups and thus draws on restrained gestures and reduced voice amplification compared with when he was trying to reach the dress circle during London stage performances of the same role in 2000. Variously magnified, d ­ istanced or distorted by the camera’s positioning, and further modified during editing, the performance of film actors signifies not less than – but differently from – that of their theatrical counterparts. Assessment of film acting also requires sensitivity to historically and geographically variant performance styles. When a woman in silent film evokes anguish by wringing her hands and violently throwing back her head, a contemporary temptation might be to identify overstated, even ‘bad’ acting (an ‘Oscar Clip’ of the sort lampooned in Wayne’s World (1992)). But it is vital to leave behind such evaluative language and acknowledge instead how gestures of this sort belong to a well-established performance style of the period\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n23\n\nthat was strongly influenced by conventions of melodrama. Film acting in later periods – including our own – is equally ­codified, even if its relative economy in the deployment of both body and voice may make it more difficult to perceive its conventions. Most recent performance in English-speaking cinema is broadly naturalistic, aiming to align itself not with the artifice of some theatrical modes but with observed human behaviour; nevertheless, actors in this tradition, from Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951; see Figure 3) to Imelda Staunton in Vera Drake (2004) and Gary Oldman in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), draw upon a systematised repertoire of expressions, gestures, movements and vocalisations in order to achieve the effect which we are now habituated to think of as ‘truth to life’. Acting in a non-naturalistic mode has not entirely disappeared even from Anglo-American cinema. Think, say, of the more manic performances of Jim Carrey. Or consider Jack Nicholson’s work in The Shining (1980), a performance that disconcerted some ­critics – including Stephen King, author of the film’s source-novel – by seeming histrionic, excessive, a violation of verisimilitude. Rather\n\n3 Naturalistic acting: Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\n\n24\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nthan condemning a lapse into implausibility, however, a more interesting option is to consider how Nicholson’s performance style interacts with other elements of mise-en-scène in the film (the acting of Shelley Duvall, say, or the choice of setting, or director Stanley Kubrick’s cinematographic decisions). Do Nicholson’s heightened gestures and vivid facial tics undermine a prevailing naturalistic effect, or, rather, do they advance tendencies already in the film towards Gothic excess? While many general accounts of mise-en-scène assume that its various elements co-operate to produce a coherent and homogeneous work, it is important to recognise that, sometimes, these features may cut across each other, thereby disrupting the smooth, continuous surface of a film. STOP and THINK • Choose a sequence some two or three minutes long from any narrative film. Be as exhaustive as possible in listing the extract’s notable pro-filmic features (leaving to one side for the moment its cinematographic choices). Be unafraid to be inventive, even provocative in suggesting the significances of these pro-filmic items. Although Jonathan Culler overstates the case when saying that ‘interpretation is interesting only when it is extreme’ (Eco et al., 1992: 110), ‘over-reading’ is certainly to be preferred to ‘under-reading’ – in film studies as in Culler’s own discipline of literary criticism. • Chapter 7 will consider the ‘commutation test’, a valuable exercise that assesses how the meaning of a particular film would be modified if a different star than the one actually cast played a particular role. In similar vein, replace each profilmic item in your selected film sequence with an equivalent (for example, substituting a futon for a four-poster bed or a hoodie for a cardigan). How do these revisions affect judgements you had previously made about character, narrative, genre classification, realism, ideology and so on? • Mise-en-scène analysis often mimics literary critical modes such as American New Criticism in assuming harmony and continuity among all stylistic elements. Assess whether the pro-filmic components of your sequence are organically\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n25\n\ninterrelated in this way, thereby affirming the coherence of the film-world. Or do pro-filmic elements jar against each other? Instabilities of this sort may sometimes be attributed to the continuity person’s doziness (Roman gladiators wearing watches; jet vapour trails hanging in the sky above nineteenth-century cowboys): consider, however, whether there may be deliberate disarray among pro-filmic features, and explore the effects of this. Cinematography\n\nThe spectator has little choice but to witness the pro-filmic f­ eatures itemised above. Unless we are watching through our fingers or from behind a cloth – the latter a viewing practice adopted, in pursuit of novel aesthetic experience, by the Surrealist Man Ray – our eyes cannot avoid falling upon all these components of a film’s visual field. However, spectators vary considerably in the extent to which they also register the numerous cinematographic processes that endow props, costumes and so on – infinite in their possible implications prior to the camera’s activity – with certain meanings rather than others. Acknowledgement of the camera’s material presence may ­initially be alien or disquieting. In mainstream cinema, evidence of the means of image capture itself is generally withheld from the spectator (other than in inadvertent sightings of, say, a camera operator’s shadow). A moment in Mel Brooks’s Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety (1977) is suggestive here. When the camera, prowling towards a window in thriller fashion, goes too far and crashes through the glass, the effect is to make visible technical operations that are usually unadvertised and, as it were, ‘naturalised’ in film. The demystification of the image-making process that this affords may, of course, have been forgotten the next time we encounter a thriller’s tracking shots (given the power of such techniques to enthral). Yet the aim of this part of the chapter is to preserve the self-conscious, High Anxiety moment – though not in killjoy style – and to offer some essential terms for recognising and evaluating cinematographic strategies. ‘Cinematography’ describes the host of decisions taken during\n\n26\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nthe recording and processing of the film image (whether that image is imprinted on celluloid or encrypted in digital videotape). Some of these technical options are relatively distinct from those bound up with the functioning of the camera itself. Filmmakers may, to begin with, choose between different types of film stock that generate images of strikingly contrasting kinds. The director and cinematographer of Three Kings (1999), set during the First Gulf War, selected a stock more customarily used in still cameras so as to yield bizarre, highly saturated colours for a sequence showing the protagonists’ hallucinatory journey through alien Iraqi desert. However, another section of the film – where visual approximation of war documentary footage was wanted – exemplifies the many laboratory (or, latterly, computer) manipulations that are available during post-production. This time the effect was created by ‘bleach bypass’ (omitting bleach during developing so as to give an antique silver tint to the image). Without discounting the creative importance of such decisions taken either side of filming, we concentrate in this section on major properties and operations of the camera itself. As Aldous Huxley, English novelist and occasional Hollywood screenwriter, remarked in 1926: ‘A good subject to talk about, cinematography’ (Clark, 1987: 17). Distance\n\nWith exceptions such as wildlife documentaries and abstract experiments, film tends to be a human-centred medium; it is unsurprising, therefore, that camera distances are generally tabulated according to the relative smallness or largeness of the human figure as it appears on screen. The most distant perspective – common in westerns, say, but rare in romcoms – is afforded by the extreme long shot, in which the figure is barely visible in an overpowering setting (hence the industry’s alternative term, ‘the geography shot’). Background is still significant in the long shot (or full shot), also, although here the figure is close enough to allow the spectator to make confident judgements about its identity. From this point on, however, shots do not disclose the entire human body, but cut it instead into successively smaller portions: the medium long shot frames the subject from below the knee upwards; the medium shot from the waist up;\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n27\n\nthe medium close-up from roughly chest height; while the close-up isolates the head and perhaps neck. Finally, the camera is most intimate (or intrusive) in the extreme close-up, which breaks up the unity of the face by showing only particular features such as the eyes or mouth. This terminology has been subject to historical adjustment. David Bordwell notes that ‘close-up’ – a term entering English around 1912 – originally referred to a shot which included a significant amount of background, rather than, as now, one tending to focus upon the human face in isolation (1997: 122–4). To point this out is not, for Bordwell, mere semantic quibbling, since grasping the precise definition of shot-types in particular periods allows the scholar to make more informed assessments of the evolution of film style. It is also important that we offer specific and nuanced – rather than absolute – judgements on the significance of various shot distances. Here brief discussion of a single example – the extreme close-up – may be helpful. One practical guide to cinematography asserts that this shot ‘lacks dignity’; it ‘makes nearly any subject sinister, aggressive and nasty’, and therefore should not be used in narrative film but restricted instead to such specialised forms as medical documentary (Thompson, 1998: 84). Leaving to one side the dubious proposition that cinema should always aim to confer ‘dignity’ upon its subjects – what about satirical or polemical films? – Thompson also unduly narrows here the semantic range of the extreme close-up. A shot of a character’s eyes may evoke grief or love or religious fervour as easily as it does brutishness. Even where the extreme close-up is used on morally questionable figures, its effects can vary. When the film noir Force of Evil (1948) cuts from a close-up of a telephone now understood as bugged by the police to an extreme close-up of the criminal protagonist’s eyes, the result is a more striking representation of panic than would be achieved by a more discreet camera distance. Yet when eyes appear in extreme close-up in the climactic gunfight of Leone’s ‘spaghetti’ western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), the shot is no longer principally informative about character (though it does disclose the relative coolness of the three protagonists); rather, as shown in Figure 4, the extreme close-up has become playful, even exuberant, one of many tactics utilised\n\n28\n\nBeginning film studies\n\n4 Extreme close-up: Clint Eastwood’s eyes in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nby the director in his reworking of the scenic choreography of the western. Similar shot distances may thus signify very differently according to the particular contexts in which they are utilised. Height, angle and level\n\nThe first of these categories refers to the degree of elevation in the camera’s positioning. As with disparate meanings of the same shot distance, variable effects can be generated by a seemingly identical choice of camera height. In Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands (1990), for example, placing the camera strikingly low during one early interior scene amounts to a critique of postwar American suburbia by suggesting, depressingly, that a dull-coloured carpet stretches to infinity. In the Henry James adaptation What Maisie Knew (2013), however, the camera’s low positioning is more sustained and functions to approximate the perspective on the world of its child protagonist (this option sometimes results in adults’ heads being cropped, further emphasising the partiality of Maisie’s knowledge of events occurring around her). With respect to camera angle, three basic options are available: high angle, straight-on angle and low angle. If the straight-on angle is presented as neutral and devoid of emphasis, the other two permutations have often been correlated with specific meanings: broadly speaking, the high angle shot from above is taken to diminish the power of its subject, and the low angle shot from below, conversely, to enhance it. Yet, as with camera distances, such claims about\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n29\n\nthe fixed significance of types of camera angle are suspect. Again, our reading of particular film sequences needs to be contextually sensitive: after all, low angle shots of a baby held up in the air by its parent scarcely impress as an image of power. Barthes argues similarly that ‘the analogical relationship between “high angle shot” and “domination” strikes us as naïve’ (Hillier, 1986: 279). Evidence for the greater semantic range of high angles can be found in the credits sequence of the Blaxploitation film Shaft (1971). When the camera zooms out from above its African American protagonist as he crosses a busy Manhattan street, he might be expected to appear ever more vulnerable, an insignificant figure in the metropolis; however, the use of high angle allows us better to recognise the cool with which he weaves through traffic – an early judgement about his mastery of urban space that is quickly confirmed as the film cuts to a straight-on, much closer shot of him giving an irate white motorist the finger. As with angle, the spectator tends to become aware of level in cinematic framing only when there is significant variation from the norm. While the frame is generally balanced in mainstream cinema, filmmakers can alter it from the horizontal so as to produce a canted shot (sometimes referred to as an ‘oblique shot’ or ‘Dutch angle’). A signature use of this technique occurs in The Third Man (1949), where a gathering sense of crisis in a noirish postwar Vienna is visually marked by canted shots that increase in obliqueness during the film (see Figure 5). However, the device survives into contemporary cinema, not least for its economy in evoking a world out of joint. In The Constant Gardener (2005), concerned with shady pharmaceutical testing in Africa, the lopsidedness of the frame in one sequence fulfils initially the low-grade function of showing the view from a truck that has crashed; more profoundly, however, the framing also hints at the region’s unbalancing by dark forces. Masking\n\nWhile the canted shot skews the film image, other cinematographic practices offer alternatives to the image’s rectangular format itself. In masked shots, variously shaped attachments to the camera lens block out some of the available light, leaving portions of the frame black or obscured. This device is most frequently used to mimic the\n\n30\n\nBeginning film studies\n\n5 Canted angle in The Third Man (1949). Note also the scene’s use of lowkey lighting\n\neffect of other optical devices such as a telescope or microscope or, as in countless war films, binoculars: very common is the cut from one army’s general raising a pair of binoculars to an extreme long shot of the opposing forces, masked in the shape of the binocular lenses. Another variation in masking is the iris shot, whereby the usual rectangular image either contracts towards or opens out from a small circular point on the screen (respectively, irising-out and irising-in). Given that the heyday of the iris was in silent cinema and immediately afterwards, its use in contemporary film tends to be nostalgic or stylised (as with Michael Winterbottom’s irising to advance the sense of self-conscious performance in A Cock and Bull Story (2005)). Movement\n\nNone of the many cinematographic options discussed above implies or requires that the camera is moving. Yet cinema is a dynamic art not only because the projection of a series of discrete celluloid or digital images generates a sense of motion, but because the apparatus involved in recording them is itself often mobile. An accurate\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n31\n\naccount of the camera’s movement, however, should d ­ istinguish between practices involving shifts in its entire body and those where there is only modification of a peripheral component. In this latter category would be placed, first of all, the pan and the tilt shot (respectively, rotations of the camera in the horizontal and the vertical planes, achieved not by its bodily relocation but by activation of a pivoting device attached to it). It is striking that some textbooks in professional cinematography argue against the use – or, at least, overuse – of pans and tilts. For Bruce Mamer, the pan is actually ‘unnatural’ since its systematic lateral movement falsifies the rapid, impressionistic, often reversible scanning of the visual field which is carried out during our extra-cinematic lives (2014: 11). Dangerously proffering certain techniques as the essence of cinema, while discounting others, this argument binds film aesthetics too closely to the properties of the human eye. Such biologically based reasoning has sometimes been used to counter another common way of achieving on-screen mobility without repositioning the camera itself: namely, the zoom (utilising a lens of variable focal length so as to produce a sensation of progressively moving towards or away from the subject – respectively, zooming-in and zooming-out). For Roy Thompson, wedded like Mamer to a realist approach that would effectively outlaw much distinctive filmmaking, the zoom is alien because it is ‘a highly artificial way of recording a picture’ (1998: 54). Categorically distinct from zooms and pans and tilts are those techniques that do involve moving the camera itself. A basic distinction should be made here between horizontal and vertical manoeuvres. Horizontal camera motions commonly take the form of tracking shots (this term, deriving from tracks laid down to enable the movement of bulky film cameras, is still current, even though the balanced, lightweight equipment available now may not require such infrastructural support). A tracking shot can be varied in speed, rhythm and direction so as to generate diverse effects: if a slow, stalking motion of the camera is apt for enhancing the suspense of a horror film or thriller, it would be undesirably eerie in a costume drama, where tracking shots might instead trace nimble, circular patterns around participants in a formal dance. Movements in the vertical plane – the camera rising or descending on a mechanically operated mount of variable length – are referred to as crane\n\n32\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nshots. While horizontal and vertical camera motions are typically kept separate in shot design, they may sometimes be combined to ­striking effect. Here a bravura example is the three-minute opening shot of Orson Welles’s film noir Touch of Evil (1958). After beginning at ground level, in a Mexican border town, the camera cranes upwards and then moves laterally for a rooftop perspective before descending and resuming a tracking motion along several streets. The same unbroken shot is extended so as to incorporate most conceivable directions of camera movement (up, down, left, right, forwards, backwards), as well as multiple rhythms (rapid approaches, slower advances, stately aerial sweeps) and variable distances (from the extreme close-up of a bomb attached to a car to extreme long shots of the cityscape). Besides advertising itself as a grand stylistic flourish, the shot also encompasses multiple individuals whose labyrinthine relationships will be disclosed as the film unfolds. When a cut finally occurs in Touch of Evil, it signals a switch of cinematographic style. The measured movements of the camera give way, for a while, to a jerky motion as people run towards the site of the bomb explosion. This hectic, staccato effect is achieved by use of handheld equipment – quite innovatory at the time of Welles’s work, but widespread, even institutionalised since in genres such as war and disaster films (Cloverfield (2008), set on a panicky night when New York is under monstrous attack, is a notably sustained venture in the handheld aesthetic). One hugely important piece of portable apparatus in this respect is the Steadicam, invented in the early 1970s by US cinematographer Garrett Brown. This incorporates a stabilising mount for the camera that is attached to the operator, thus reproducing the handheld camera’s intimacy and extensive territorial range but without repeating its unsteady, even queasy locomotion. Discussion in Chapter 2 of Aleksandr Sokurov’s film Russian Ark (2002) will consider how the Steadicam has modified not only mise-en-scène but also editing. Focus\n\nAll of those camera movements so far described potentially affect one further property of the film image: its quality of focus. Here the filmmaker’s selection from lenses that range from wide-angle through medium focal lengths to the telephoto will also be sig-\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n33\n\nnificant. Options include shallow focus, where the foremost plane of the image is sharply outlined in contrast to fuzzier middle and rear portions; deep focus, where all of the planes are defined clearly; and racking or pulling focus, where focal sharpness is redistributed in the course of a shot from foreground to background, or vice versa. As with all other cinematographic choices, these are more than merely technical matters. Deep focus, for example, first prominent in such geographically dispersed films as Erich von Stroheim’s Greed (1924), Kenji Mizoguchi’s Osaka Elegy (1936) and Jean Renoir’s The Rules of the Game (1939), has figured in film studies as a topic of ideological and philosophical debate. Bazin argues in What Is Cinema? that, mimicking our natural habits of vision, deep focus is the most humane of film modes. ‘Every technique relates to a metaphysic’, he writes elsewhere (Hillier, 1985: 78); and, for Bazin, the philosophical significance of deep focus consists in its implying the unbrokenness of space and time, since such shot composition presents with perfect clarity multiple events that are occurring simultaneously on different planes. Yet it has been a key argument of this chapter that it is dangerous to derive fixed meanings from a particular technical choice. If deep focus in some films seems indeed to have harmonious, humane connotations, its occurrence elsewhere may be more ambiguous (as, for example, where it is combined with a canted camera angle). As with all other aspects of mise-en-scène, then, locally sensitive interpretation is necessary in order to assess the meaning or value of deep focus in a given context. STOP and THINK • Returning to the film sequence that you surveyed earlier for pro-filmic elements, unpack now its cinematography. Identify precisely choices of camera distance; heights, angles and levels of the camera; uses, if any, of masking the lens; varieties of camera movement; and focal selections. What meanings are produced, singly and collectively, by the cinematographic options taken in the sequence? Is there ­coherence – or perhaps dissonance – among the techniques used? • Narrowing your focus still further, select just a few shots from the sequence (remembering that a shot is a segment of\n\n34\n\nBeginning film studies\n\ncontinuous filming before a cut or some other transition). In each of these shots, alter at least one cinematographic variable. For example, the extreme long shot of Julie Andrews singing exultantly with her arms outstretched on an Austrian mountain at the start of The Sound of Music (1964) might remain but be masked now by binocular lenses, or might occur with the camera lowered in height from the sky to edelweiss level. How do the adjustments that you make transform the meaning of your chosen shots? • Broadening your range of reference, select one or two of the cinematographic practices outlined above – the close-up, perhaps, or the pan, or the canted shot – and review their use in films with which you are familiar. Test one of this chapter’s arguments by assessing whether the meanings generated by these techniques are relatively stable and uniform or, on the contrary, variable and context-specific. Colour and its meanings\n\nWhen the Russian writer Maxim Gorky attended an early programme of Lumière films in 1896, the new medium struck him not so much as freshly stimulating the senses as causing two kinds of sensory deficit. Chapter 3 will turn to Gorky’s remarks on the soundlessness of film compared with everyday noise; here, however, we draw attention to his observations on film’s disquieting lack of colour: ‘Everything there – the earth, the trees, the people, the water and the air – is dipped in monotonous grey. Grey rays of the sun across the grey sky, grey eyes in grey faces, and the leaves of the trees are ashen grey’ (Leyda, 1960: 407). Gorky was, of course, writing during that earliest cinematic moment when monochrome images – their monochrome also quite undifferentiated tonally – were all that were possible. A little later, hand-painting of some film frames would begin, followed first by artificial colouring of sequences through stencilling, toning and tinting, then by capture of the entire colour spectrum on film’s photographic medium itself, most vividly in the Technicolor process that was pioneered in 1917. Yet it is striking that in his very early contribution to commentary on cinema, Gorky should give the question of colour an\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n35\n\nimportance which it has occupied only occasionally in later film studies. While such a lack has been partly rectified by Bristol University’s recent programme of research in this field and by publication of a number of important books (see this chapter’s ‘Selected reading’), film studies has often been marked by what David Batchelor calls chromophobia: a tendency, seen by Batchelor as extending beyond coverage of cinema to that of painting too, for colour as an object of interest to be ‘systematically marginalized’ and ‘diminished’ (2000: 22). There have been only a few instances, in fact, when colour has been paramount in thinking about film. Its growing availability to Hollywood before World War II, for example, occasioned fierce debate between on the one hand those welcoming it just as they had sound as an enhancement of cinema’s capacity to document the world fully, and on the other hand anti-realists like the German-born critic Rudolf Arnheim who deplored colour – as in his 1935 essay, ‘Remarks on Colour Film’ – for threatening the aesthetics of cinema that had developed during the monochrome era. More typically, however, film studies has either treated colour cursorily or omitted it altogether. The topic’s historic lack of status is fairly reflected by the fact that it occupies only a few pages even in the encyclopaedic account given of mise-en-scène by Bordwell and Thompson in Film Art. Bordwell and Thompson place colour within the pro-filmic elements of mise-en-scène, notably as a sub-class of ‘setting’. This makes some sense: colour signifies powerfully in cinematic locations ranging from the beige hospital spaces of Dallas Buyers Club (2013) to the variously red, green and white portions of the baroque restaurant in Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989). It is also to be found elsewhere in the pro-filmic range, especially as a key attribute of costume. However, besides dwelling, as it were, on the surface of objects scanned by the camera, colour is also liable to be augmented, altered, even invented at the cinematographic level. As in the case of Three Kings, filmmakers working with celluloid may begin by choosing a stock that produces unexpected colour relations. During filming itself they might select from a number of filtering media that moderate or even exclude certain colours while promoting others (Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic (2000) systematically uses colour filters to achieve three distinct looks of bleached-out yellow, steely blue and vibrant primaries,\n\n36\n\nBeginning film studies\n\neach c­ orresponding to one of the film’s several narrative strands). Colour may also be chemically modified after filming via manipulations of the developing process. All of these adjustments to colour are feasible even without taking into account the multiple creative possibilities that have been opened up by the decision of many current filmmakers to shoot on digital videotape rather than traditional stock. However it is achieved, colour performs a number of functions in film. Besides serving as a device for historical and geographical authentication (black for Victorian England, say), or as a means of genre specification (few dull browns crop up in 1950s American musicals, few pinks in Ken Loach’s radical political dramas), colour may, as in Traffic, contribute towards narrative organisation. Exemplary here is the Chinese martial arts film Hero (2002), which has a tripartite colour scheme: red and gold, white and green, and blue. But whereas in Soderbergh’s film these colour motifs are distributed spatially, in Hero they are segmented temporally, with one replacing the other to mark the shift to another version of key events that are in dispute. The example of Hero also alerts us to colour’s symbolic and thematic potentialities. Consider briefly some work by one of contemporary Hollywood’s more distinctive colourists, Tim Burton. In Edward Scissorhands, the vivid primaries used for the suburb’s houses would seem to connote optimism and well-being; however, the excessive saturation of these colours, coupled with the fact that no darker or mixed shades are visible, alerts the spectator to a critique of suburban blandness and conformity. By contrast, black in the clothing worn by Johnny Depp as Edward carries suggestions of rebelliously Gothic, romantic, even punk sensibility (as well as hinting at a racial diversity repressed by the all-white suburb). While maintaining a thematic approach to colouring, however, Burton reverses the value of particular hues in the animated Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride (2005). Bright primary colours signify positively now, suggesting the vibrancy of the film’s underworld as against the oppressive society above ground that subsists in a grey as monotonous and desolate as that observed by Gorky. Variations of this kind across the work of a single director indicate the need for us to be sensitive to film colour’s multiple interpretative possibilities. Film studies requires alertness to the\n\nSeeing film: mise-en-scène\n\n37\n\nmany p ­ ossible forms of what the art critic John Gage calls ‘colour-­ thinking’ (1993: 8). Experimental British director Derek Jarman, who worked with colour in painting and gardening as well as in cinema, evokes a state virtually of chromatic chaos when he refers to ‘the bordello of the spectrum’: one person’s ‘green of birth’ might be another’s ‘colour of pus’ (1995: 52, 70). While Jarman makes a fair point about people’s differing chromatic sensibilities, it would be unsatisfactory for study of film colour to consist simply in inventorying a mass of subjective impressions. One way to move beyond discussion of individual tastes, then, is to explore the cultural determinations of colour on screen. Chromatic effects in film have, to begin with, a history: the Technicolor sequences of The Wizard of Oz carried a greater utopian charge in Depression-era America than they can do in the colour-saturated consumer economy of the United States today. Chromatic effects also have a geography: the ‘colour world of England’, for instance, ‘is not the same as that of Berlin’ (Batchelor, 2000: 37). In similar vein, the Soviet film director and theorist Sergei Eisenstein acknowledges that ‘different countries have different notions of colour. For example, white here is not associated with grief, whereas for the Chinese it is the colour of mourning’ (1996: 323). Finally, we should also register and explore ‘the gendering of colour’ (Gage, 1993: 208). Without endorsing a crudely classificatory approach that looks out for ‘masculine’ earth tones and ‘feminine’ lavenders and lilacs, sensitivity to the relations in particular film contexts between colour coding and sexual politics is important. The history of colour in cinema is one of its normalisation. From patchy beginnings in only the most commercially advantaged cinematic cultures, it has come to be globally adopted: part, indeed, of the common sense of film now. This naturalisation of colour, however, means that in our period heightened significance may be accrued by work that is variously shot or processed in monochrome (or, using less technically precise terminology, ‘black-and-white’). Recently, colour has been renounced not only by avant-gardists but by some directors still aiming for mass audiences: Michael Hazanavicius’s Oscar-winning The Artist (2011), for instance, or Alexander Payne’s Nebraska (2013), or Ben Wheatley’s English Civil War drama, A Field in England (2013), or Pawel Pawlikowski’s\n\n38\n\nBeginning film studies\n\nIda (2013), set in a bleak Poland of the early 1960s. If each of these films aptly utilises monochrome to advance a sense of ‘pastness’, that is not to say that this stylistic choice conduces only to nostalgia or elegy. Colour’s expunging from film may, in fact, be as semiotically rich and varied as its exploitation. Case study: 12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nFor Steve McQueen, the British director of 12 Years a Slave, fashioning his film’s visual dimension was charged with ethical and political seriousness. ‘All I wanted to do was see those images’, he says in an interview, referring to the many shots he includes of African American slaves being abused, punished, even killed: ‘That has always been the power for me.
