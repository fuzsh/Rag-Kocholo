BANKNOTE NEWS Compiled by Murray Hanewich (3649) TUNISIA HONORS peecm ee — THE COUNTRY’S ff 929000 «tail ah FIRSTFEMALE | Mis 6 PHYSICIAN ON ITS 10 DINAR BANKNOTE When a team from the Central Bank of Tunisia looked into redesigning some of their banknotes a few years ago, they knew they wanted to honor a contemporary figure on the 10 dinar note, someone who had made significant contributions to their country—who was, as Bank Governor Marouane El Abassi put it, “a bearer of Tunisian expertise.” They selected the late Tawhida Ben Cheikh (1909- 2010), Tunisia’s trailblazing first female physician, as the face of the new banknote, which debuted in spring 2020. Among many firsts, Ben Cheikh was the first female student in Tunisia to receive a university degree, in 1928, and reportedly was the first North African Muslim woman to earn a medical degree (in 1936, from the University of Paris). She is thought to be the first modern female doctor not only in Tunisia but in the Arab world. Ben Cheikh has made history again, albeit posthumously, as the second woman to have her likeness featured on Tunisian currency. She follows Elissa (Dido), the legendary founder and queen of ancient Carthage, who first appeared on the 10 dinar banknote in 2005. The new banknote is also reportedly the first in the world to honor a female physician. “IT thought clearly that we need someone from the contemporary era,” said El Abassi, adding that they were not explicitly looking for a female honoree. “After the revolution of a decade ago, we wanted the banknotes to be a mirror of the whole country.” her return to Ben Cheikh opened a private medical that After Tunis, clinic treated q 4 to + * i 4 a } Bs Wy ) | patients regardless of 0000010 - | nationality or ability to pay. The only female doctor in the country for some years, she became influential in Tunisian medicine, family planning practices, and legislation; as an obstetrician-gynecologist she founded the country’s first family planning clinic and led campaigns around access to contraception and abortion, which was first legalized to a limited degree in 1965. Ben Cheikh was the first female doctor accepted in the National Council of the Order of Physicians of Tunisia. Later in her career she served as vice president of the Tunisian Red Crescent. Born into a conservative, well-to-do family, Ben Cheikh credited the support of her widowed mother for her ability to achieve high levels of education, despite opposition from male relatives, at a time when such opportunities for women in colonial Tunisia were rare. Nearly a century later, female students are fully represented at Tunisian colleges and universities, according to El Abassi, with women comprising over half the student population. In 2018, Tunisia was designated the “Capital of Arab Women 2018-2019” by the Arab League in recognition of efforts in the country to promote the status of women. The vivid blue 10 dinar banknotes honoring Ben Cheikh, designed by Ali Fakhet, a Tunisian artist, feature a portrait of Ben Cheikh on the front and images of handmade, intricately designed Berber pottery and jewelry on the back. INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 By Security details such as three-dimensional threads, iridescent coating, micro-text printing, circles with a spinning effect, translucent features, and fluorescent fibers that glow when exposed to ultraviolet rays. In addition to honoring the legacy of Ben Cheikh and the generations of women she inspired, the new banknote is meant to celebrate the contributions of all Tunisian women, according to El Abassi. Although designed before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the new banknote pays tribute to Tunisia’s doctors and other essential—and mostly female— health care workers during the crisis. “This was a very good message to the doctors and health care workers who are fighting COVID-19 in Tunisia.” Tawhida Ben Cheikh and other members of AEMNA (Association of North African Muslim Students) in Paris, 1930. Public reception of the new banknote has been positive, EI Abassi said. To better reach younger Tunisians, the central bank worked with a local start-up to develop an augmented reality app, “Flouss,” to tell the stories behind their banknotes. Melinda Weir / IMF - Fall 2020 Issue / Finance & Development 100 YEARS AFTER DISAPPEARING, REMAINS OF ZEPPELIN AIRCRAFT [WITH GERMAN PRINTED UKRAINIAN BANKNOTES] FOUND AT CRASH SITE IN SILESIA A German Zeppelin Staaken aircraft carrying sacks -8- INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 of money and gold on a secret mission to the fledgling Western People’s Ukrainian Republic has been found after disappearing just over 100 years ago in Silesia, southwest Poland. Described as Central Europe’s first ever air disaster, the location of the crash site remained a mystery until earlier this month when a group of local explorers found remains of the aircraft in a forest near Racibérz. At the time of its disappearance, Ukraine was fighting the Bolsheviks trying to establish a new state. The German Reich had become the Weimar Republic, Poland had recently declared its independence after 123 years and the first Silesian uprising was about to begin in Poland. On 4 August 1919, the Zeppelin Staaken took off from Breslau but never arrived at its destination of Kamieniec Podolski in Ukraine. The craft was a huge five-engine biplane, as big asa flying fortresses from World War Two. It was transporting Ukrainian banknotes printed in Germany as well as gold and silver coins for the new state of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic. The cargo of banknotes and coins was essential for the new state to exist, to function normally and to fight for its independence. Newspaper reports from the time reveal that locals heard an explosion. One of the pilots jumped out of the cockpit but his parachute did not open, and he died when he crashed to the ground. Other reports claim that the crew dumped chests full of freshly printed Ukrainian banknotes and sacks of gold and silver coins overboard, perhaps in a desperate attempt to keep the craft in the air. When the plane crashed all the passengers and crew died and the causes of the accident remained a puzzle. ‘The six-man crew were German and despite their young age they were all experienced airmen. Some of them had flown in bombing raids over France and Britain during the Great War. On board were also two Ukrainian passengers. One of them was Dmytro Witowski, a Ukrainian officer who was a commander in the Ukrainian uprising in Lwéw in November 1918 against the Poles. He took part in the Paris Peace Conference in Versailles and was a supporter of the peaceful reconciliation of Western Ukraine with Poland. Newspaper reports suggest that the craft may have been shot down and speculation exists among historians that Silesian insurgents who wanted Silesia to join the newly emerged state of Poland may have been responsible. While the Ukrainian currency was of little value, the gold and silver German marks were of great value and would have allowed insurgent groups to continue operating. When the plane crashed, the site was part of Germany. Therefore, German officials came and took away the bodies of the crew and the two Ukrainian passengers as well as parts of the aircraft that remained. Over the years, knowledge of the crash site faded from memory. As time went by, the site became covered by a carpet of greenery, hiding completely the wounds that the burning plane scorched into the earth. The roots of the trees gathered around the remnants of the fuselage, breaking it into small pieces and pulled the whole history of the event under the ground. It seemed that the crash would remain forever just a footnote in local history. That was until a passionate local historian Henryk Postawka published articles in the local press several years ago with details of where he believed the crash took place. Piotr Konarski from the Silesian Exploration Group told TEN: “Although the search site measured 70 hectares, we knew from Postawka’s articles and from lots of research in archives more or less where it happened. “We were able to narrow it down, so step by step, we methodically examined each part of the forest. “Eventually, at the top of a small hill we found the remains of melted aluminium, so we knew we were in the right place. “Then we hit the jackpot. We found a button with Cyrillic letters. Then, soon after we dug up plates from the oil tank and the compass. “We knew then that we had found the Zeppelin.” According to Konarski, the button almost certainly belonged to one of the Ukrainian passengers. One of the plates, meanwhile, bears the inscription “Zeppelin- Werke G.m.b.H. Staaken’, which is unquestionable proof that they had found the crash site. Although the site has now been found, mysteries remain. What caused the crash and what happened to the valuables on board? Were the Silesian insurgents in the vicinity involved in any way? One tantalizing clue came to light unexpectedly during the search. Konarski revealed that when they were working at the site a man approached them saying that he was the grandson of a Silesian insurgent. He recalled that his grandfather had been in the area at the time of the crash and that he came into the possession of a number of silver coins. The Zeppelin was transporting Ukrainian banknotes printed in Germany as well as gold and silver coins for the new state of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic. inn-Werke Breslau. | The Zeppelin Staaken took off from Breslau on 4 August 1919 but never arrived at its destination of Kamieniec Podolski in Ukraine. The group now plans to search the site more thoroughly and finally to erect a commemorative plaque. The remains from the plane will likely go on display in a local museum. Stuart Dowell / The First News (TFN) Poland 28.10.20202 INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 -9- ADIEU TO THE BRUNEI $10,000! On September 29, 2020, the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) (Monetary Authority of Brunei) announced that the BND 10,000 banknotes will no longer be issued to all banks in Brunei Darussalam and subsequently will be withdrawn from circulation - effective November 2, 2020. Only two BND 10,000 banknotes have ever been issued, a paper banknote in 1989 and a reduced-size polymer banknote in 2006. The paper banknote was available from the bank from 1989-2006 and the polymer version since 2006, a total of 14 years The 10,000 banknotes will remain legal tender and will retain their full face value. The decision to withdraw the BND 10,000 banknotes is one of the steps taken by the AMBD to reduce the risks associated with financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorism financing and counterfeiting of high denominations currency notes. But the 10,000 was obviously not a banknote found in most people’s purses and wallets: it was more “play money” and a prestige item for the Sultan, his family and the super-rich. The current face value of the banknote equates to: - EUR 6,256 - USD 7,337 Brunei maintains a Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA) with Singapore, meaning that the BND 10,000 = SGD 10,000. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) discontinued the issuance of its -10- INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 10,000 in October 2014. Since that time, the AMBD has been under international pressure to discontinue the issuance of its 10,000. And now that has occurred. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, travel to and entry into Brunei is almost impossible at present, so a run on the AMBD for 10,000s before November 2nd will surely not occur. So if you have one, a few, or a bundle, consider yourself lucky! This banknote remains extremely popular due to its prestige status and its being one of the key notes for a complete polymer collection. With the withdrawal of the Brunei 10,000, the banknote with the highest face value in the world is then the Swiss 1000, with a face value of EUR 927 (USD 1,087). Donald Ludwig / Harrisburg, PA, USA / www.polymernotes.org DE LA RUE EXTENDS DEAL TO PRINT UK BANK NOTES IN ESSEX UNTIL 2028 ‘The Bank of England has extended its deal with De La Rue to print UK banknotes until 2028. The company, headquartered in Basingstoke, has secured the right to continue as the sole printer of Bank of England notes for another three years after its current contract expires in 2025. It will continue to run the Bank’s printing hub in Debden, Essex, including printing the new polymer Alan Turing £50 note from next year. The deal extension was announced on Friday by the banknote and passport maker in a statement to investors. No details on the finances of the agreement were released. De La Rue has been working with the central bank since 2003. Yahoo Finance U.K. / 30.10.2020 CURRENCY REVAMP SPURS RUSH FOR NEW BANK ACCOUNTS IN ETHIOPIA Ethiopia’s effort to stamp out counterfeiting by introducing new currency notes is pulling people who've never had a bank account into the financial system. At least 1.3 million previously unbanked Ethiopians have handed in their two-decade-old banknotes over the past month since the demonetization process was started, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told lawmakers on Monday. In exchange, they were given a bank account from which they can draw the new notes. The regulator is trying to deter cash hoarding that enables corruption and illegal trading to thrive, and escapes the tax net. Only 35% of Ethiopian adults held a bank account in 2017, lagging peers such as neighboring Kenya, where the ratio is 82%, according to the World Bank. Over the past year, the number of accounts in the country has increased 31% to 50.7 million, the Prime Minister said. The Horn of Africa nation of 100 million people is following a process that flopped in India. There steps in 2016 to ban high-denomination currency notes to try weed out cash gained through illegal means backfired as economic growth slowed and millions of daily wage earners lost their livelihoods. While Kenya’s demonetization process that started last year went smoothly, the equivalent of about $68 million was not returned, according to the central bank. South Sudan is also contemplating demonetization to curb illicit financial flows. The rush of applications forced the nation’s biggest commercial lender to assign more tellers to only handle money changing at its main branch next to its headquarters in the capital, Addis Ababa. The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia branch gained at least 1,000 customers over the last four weeks, while many others deposited cash in accounts that had been dormant. “On the first day of the new currency notes, you wouldn’t believe what happened here -- everybody came,” said Nebyou Birhanu, who heads digital services at CBE. “The money is coming into the bank.” For Ethiopia, the initiative has added 37 billion birr ($991 million) to the 990 billion birr of deposits that were in the country’s 19 banks at the end of March. The central bank estimates there was 92 billion birr of unbanked cash in Ethiopia in July 2019. “We expect more people, in the rural and urban areas, to open bank accounts,” National Bank of Ethiopia Governor Yinager Dessie told state television last week. The central bank is preparing to allow non-financial institutions to offer mobile-money services, opening up banking to local phone companies. To ward off that threat, Commercial Bank of Ethiopia updated its banking app to allow customers to get credit, pay utility bills and transfer cash more easily, said Nebyou. Dawit Belay, a 36-year- old car importer, said he supported the drive. He spoke as he withdrew cash at United Bank SC’s Gandhi Branch in central Addis Ababa, where tellers were tending to the steady flow of customers. “About the new currency, I feel like it’s very safe,” he said. “Tt’s good for the whole community, as everything comes inside the system. We’re not going to use as much cash anymore.” Bloomberg/Quint Samuel Gebre & Simon Marks / 21.10.2020 INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 -1I- BANCO CENTRAL DE LA REPUBLICA ARGENTINA (BCRA) MUSEUM SEES RETURN OF STOLEN PAPER MONEY SKETCHES BY INTERPOL INTERPOL Argentina will return eight stolen paper money sketches from 1935, 1941, 1948 and 1983 to the BCRA. They were about to be auctioned in the United States. The Department for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of the Federal Police together with the FBI's Art Crime Division—both part of INTERPOL International—recovered the works and delivered them to the Consulate General of Argentina in New York. In the coming days, the BCRA's authorities will receive the works in Buenos Aires. In January 2018, the BCRA reported the disappearance of the sketches from the “Héctor Carlos Janson” Numismatic and Historical Museum upon learning that some of them were on the verge of being put up for auction in New York. Once the Federal Justice ordered that the sketches be entered into the international database of stolen works of art, different international organizations began to work together. The FBI's Art Crime Team got into contact with the numismatist that had the sketches in his possession. The collector, now under investigation, denied knowing that the sketches had been stolen and handed them in to the FBI. In turn, the court ordered their repatriation through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Argentina. “The recovery of these prototypes is significant for the BCRA as it is a way of recovering the cultural heritage of Argentine society,” stated Mabel Esteve, Director of “Héctor Carlos Janson” Numismatic and Historical Museum. The sketches were handmade using different techniques. ‘They were drawn by outstanding artists from the BCRA’s design department and the Mint House, and by designers from companies such as Thomas de la Rue and Waterloo and Son, which were hired by the BCRA after it became the monetary authority.

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, FRANCE, 100 NOUVEAUX FRANCS 3.12.1959, P-144 NAPOLEON BONAPARTE Napoleon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 — 5 May 1821) was a French statesman and military leader who led many successful campaigns during the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars and was Emperor of the French (as Napoleon I) from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon was serving as an artillery officer in the French Royal Army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. At age 26, he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs in the War of the First Coalition—winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing “sister republics” with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. Napoleon’s ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. The balance of power in Europe shattered, intractable differences with the British meant that the French were soon facing a Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon emerged triumphant over this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic success over the Russian Empire and Austrian Empire at the Battle of Austerlitz which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena -16- INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 and Auerstedt, then marched his “Grande Armée” deep into Eastern Europe and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the Battle of Friedland. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram in July. Napoleon then occupied the Iberian Peninsula, but the Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, featured extensive guerrilla warfare, and ended in victory for the Allies in 1814. The French launched a major invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the Grand Army and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the War of the Sixth Coalition. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor Battle of Hanau allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of Elba off the coast of Tuscany, and the Bourbon dynasty was restored to power. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition which defeated him at the Battle of Waterloo in June. He was exiled to the remote British island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51. \\ (HY alte VN Grae.

Wellesley was born in Dublin into the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de- camp to two successive lords lieutenant of Ireland. He was also elected as a member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons. He was a colonel by 1796 and saw action in the Netherlands and in India, where he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the Battle of Seringapatam. He was appointed governor of Seringapatam and Mysore in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the Maratha Confederacy at the Battle of Assaye in 1803. Wellesley rose to prominence as a general during the Peninsular campaign of the Napoleonic Wars and was promoted to the rank of field marshal after leading the allied forces to victory against the French Empire at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. Following Napoleon’s exile in 1814, he served as the ambassador to France and was granted a dukedom. During the Hundred Days in 1815, he commanded the allied army which, together with a Prussian Army under Bliicher, defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Wellington’s battle record is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career. Wellington is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare, resulting in several victories against numerically superior forces while minimizing his own losses. After the end of his active military career, he returned to politics. He was twice British prime minister as a member of the Tory party from 1828 to 1830 and for a little less than a month in 1834. He oversaw the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 but opposed the Reform Act 1832. He continued as one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement and remained Commander-in- Chief of the British Army until his death. BATTLE OF WATERLOO The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near Waterloo in Belgium, part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time. A French army under the command of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the Seventh Coalition: a British-led coalition (consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau) under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and a Prussian army under the command of Field Marshal von Bliicher. Wellington and Bliicher’s armies were located close to the northeastern border of France.

On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, causing the Prussians to withdraw, but parallel to Wellington and in good order. Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to stand his ground near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the French Imperial Guard. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed. According to Wellington, the battle was “the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life”. Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. This ended the First French Empire and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of -18- INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 relative peace, often referred to as the “Pax Britannica”. Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded and Bliicher some 7,000. Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or wounded and included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.

However, these are not the only printing companies involved in the production of notes for this Bank, and certainly they were not the only ones interested. When the Numismatic Collection of the BdM! was digitized and made public, we were able to see trials and specimens printed by the English company Waterlow and Sons Limited (W8&S) unknown to most of Mexican notafilists and to even W&S’ experts. As in other countries where ABNC practically held a monopoly, multiple companies attempted to wrest part of the market share from it and, as we will see in this article, W&S almost succeeded in Mexico. Let’s start with some background. W&S was created in 1810 by James Waterlow (figure 1) as a legal document printer. Taking advantage of English industrial and banking growth, throughout the 19th century it expanded its operations to other activities such as the printing of envelopes for telegrams and other types of stationery, newspapers and magazines, train schedules and tickets, and security forms such as stamps, checks, bonds and banknotes. Due to family differences it operated as two separate companies between 1877 and 1920, Waterlow * | appreciate the contributions of Shaun Hayes, Fabrizio Raponi and Carmelo Spinella for this article and Mark Tomasko for his kind suggestions and comments. 1 www.banxico.org.mx/ColeccionNumismatica Brothers & Layton and Waterlow & Sons but to meet the demand for postwar reconstruction it was reunited. Figure 1 Source: British Commerce and Industry (1934) In those years, this company made significant technical advances in the production of watermarked paper, ink manufacturing and security printing, including the adoption of photoengraving processes and the use of rotary presses. Contrary to popular belief, its output grew during the war, due to requests by the British Government to urgently print ration cards and banknotes to replace the circulation of gold coins, and also printed postage stamps for the Belgian government in exile. Its reunification allowed it to make its production even more efficient INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 -2]- -22- by specializing the activities of its six printers located in London, Watford and Dunstable, and making it one of the largest security printers worldwide. While the ABNC overwhelmingly dominated the banknote market between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries in the Americas, this did not prevent English companies such as Thomas de la Rue & Co. Limited, Bradbury Wilkinson & Company (the latter subsidiary of ABNC from 1903) and W&S itself from seeking some contracts.” At the end of the 1920s, part of its operations went into crisis after losing the contract to print shilling- denominated banknotes with the British Treasury, which passed to the Bank of England, and also its reputation was tarnished when it was made public that it was involved in the fraudulent issue of Banco de Portugal banknotes. W&S was hired by an alleged representative of the Bank of Portugal to reprint banknotes that would theoretically be resealed for its use in Angola, but which were put into circulation in Portugal. Despite having to pay the fabulous £ 697,416 in 1932 (£ 327 million in present value!*), W8&S was able to continue its business and seek new customers. Thus, at the beginning of the following decade, there were numerous exchanges of communications between this company and the then Banco de México, S.A. Through information gathered from the minutes of the Board of Directors meetings and the —incomplete— correspondence between both parties that I have managed to review at the Bank's Historical Archive, as part of an ongoing project, I will try to recreate how W&S tried to obtain BdM bank note business and what the result was. In the middle of World War II, W&S tried to keep its business with countries away from the theater of war and to look for new clients. For this reason, in 1942 its Director in charge of fiduciary issues for Latin America, Mr. Henry C. Houghton, made a stopover in Mexico to meet with officials of the central bank which had requested from other central banks reports on the quality and durability of W&S banknotes. To follow up on this request, this 2 W8S got contracts to print banknotes for most countries in Latin America for private and government banks: Argentina (Cordoba province), Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela and, to my knowledge, beyond some revenue stamps. Beyond revenue stamps & philatelic items, in Mexico it produced bonds and shares and a private issue for the Negociacion de Pinos Altos, Chihuahua in 1886. oO 3. Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H.

Maristany as its representative. WATERLOW & SONS LIMITED, LONOON WALL. LONDON IMPMERION Oe Crgue AAICANTER Of OER mre woe Figure 2 Waterlow & Sons Limited Header That meeting does not seem to have been successful. Nevertheless, as a result of Enrico Sanpietro's counterfeiting of the 100 peso bill with the portrait of Madero, Mr. Houghton renewed his approach this time writing directly to the General Director, Eduardo Villasenor. Although the Bank declined the offer, arguing that it had sufficient low and high denomination banknotes in its inventory, the fact that not one but two denominations had been successfully counterfeited (and soon a third one), motivated the Bank to explore other banknote suppliers, including W&S. W&S was widely recognized for the state of the art in the production of the substrate used to print banknotes. It used a 65-35% or 75-25% mix of flax and cotton, depending on the weather conditions, which gave its banknotes greater resistance, particularly useful for lower denominations, with heavier circulation, as well as the possibility of incorporating security measures such as watermarks, fibers visible to the naked eye, phosphorescent fibers visible under ultraviolet light, as well as metallic threads, particularly attractive for higher value banknotes. The Chase National Bank of New York, in September 1945, acted as intermediary for the BdM to request the first quote for the engraving and printing of the eight banknote denominations under multiple assumptions. Although the cost of engraving was lower than that of ABNC, the printing was on average more expensive. It should be noted that W&S considered very small quantities compared to those regularly requested by the Bank from the US-based company. The costs of ocean freight from the United Kingdom to Veracruz, the land freight from this port to Mexico City, and insurance were still to be added. In November of that same year, the BdM began contacts with W&S to explore the possibility of making engravings and printing 50 million one-peso banknotes, to replace those printed by ABNC (figure 3), which were rapidly wearing out due to their intense circulation. Although W&sS was given the authority to select the proportion of oH. 7 r ‘ i flax and cotton suitable for Mexico according to its climate, the issuing authority indicated its preference to include watermarks and a band of visible silk threads. The quote requested that each banknote should have date, series, numbering and three signatures on the front and two stamps on the back. They should also come individually cut, although if it were cheaper they could come in sheets of four bills each. The quotation sent in January 1946 through Peter R. Mitchell, Representative in Latin America, amounted to £ 97,955. This included front and back engraving on steel plates; the printing of 50 million individual banknotes of 60 x 120 mm, on 65% flax 35% cotton paper, with a band of visible threads. The banknotes would have a steel print - i> r,) us a: eM eepr): bie. 2@ ce i pe} jl (a portrait of Benito Judrez* on the front on the left side and a national coat of arms on the back) and two color lithographic prints, in addition to geometric engravings. It also included packaging in lined boxes, freight to Veracruz and insurance for face value. W&S indicated it has the possibility of delivering 8 million banknotes monthly, two months after the designs were approved. Fluorescent silk threads would be available for an additional 1,330 pounds. 4 Prior to the reunification of the company in 1920, Waterlow Brothers & Layton, had prepared a portrait of Benito Juarez very similar to the one used on Bank of London and Mexico banknotes printed by ABNC. This vignette is attributed by Carmelo Spinella, expert in this company, to John Augustus Charles Harrison (1872-1955), its main engraver. | do not know if this vignette was considered in any proposal for these notes. INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 29 32 SS 4 - : ——— =—y th BARA 4... — {ON bs 2 ze : Ss ~ - jo% 2 SETURL EPSS LTE, OURAN, From this quotation, a negotiation began that reduced the price to 94,585 pounds including shipping to Mexico City. With these new conditions, the cost per thousand of printing, freight and insurance became lower than that of ABNC, $ 7.66 in medium size and 7.59 in small size, compared to 8.40 for the American company. In parallel, the Central Bank’s Bureau of Special Investigations, headed by Eng. Alfonso Quiroz Cuarén, and W&S initiated contacts to verify the technical Figure 4 specifications of the paper, inks and printing of the Benito Juarez Vignette 6832 engraved by WB&L banknotes, and to ensure that they were resistant to the Carmelo Spinella © 2020 Porthole Publications 2 Y traditional means of falsification - most likely prompted by the recent counterfeits. In December 1946, W8&S -24- INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 reported that they had managed to develop special inks that significantly altered color if they tried to be transferred. On April 12, 1946 W&S presented the front and back design of the banknote in a 60 x 110 mm format. I suppose that these correspond to those catalogued in the Numismatic Collection of the BdM as specimens 183 and 184 bearing the M series and surprisingly a later date (figure 5). In the meeting of May 8, 1946, the General Directorate submitted for the consideration of the Board of Directors the proposal to print banknotes with W&S “of a different model and better class of paper than the one used in the ABNC banknotes.”? The proposal was approved and instructed to order a new issue for a total of one hundred million pesos ranging from AA to AJ series, that is, ten million pieces each. The following day, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) was informed about this decision, and the Minister, Eduardo Suarez, immediately replied that he would not exercise his veto right. With these authorizations, on May 14 the Bank asked the W&S for a new quote, this time for 50 and 100 million banknotes in two sizes 60 x 110 mm, which it had already quoted, and 67 x 158 mm similar to the existing ones printed by ABNC. The price was again above ABNC’s, but included a new type of microscopic engraving, freight and insurance to the Mexico City. The price negotiations continued, including the possibility of not using silk threads and/or contracting insurance in Mexico. The first option to maintain the security of the banknotes was discarded, but it was agreed to hire the Aseguradora Mexicana. Hence, on June 14 the BdM requested the printing of the hundred million banknotes with the following modifications: ¢ Size 156 x 67 mm. ¢ — Inclusion of the initials S.A. below the legend Banco de México. ¢ Numbering, date 8-V-46 (from the session when the Board instructed the issuance of those notes) and series on both sides of the obverse. ¢ Devote the lower part exclusively to the signatures in the following series regime: 5 AHBanxico ACA #1129 Series | Board Member Government Interventor | Cashier AA Evaristo Araiza Arturo Diaz Restori Salvador Marquez AB Roberto Lopez Francisco Llamas Suarez | Salvador Marquez AC Antonio Carrillo Flores | Manuel Lépez Salvador Marquez AD Emilio Suberbie Arturo Diaz Restori Salvador Marquez AE Daniel Cosio Villegas Francisco Llamas Suarez | Salvador Marquez AF Graciano Guichard Manuel Lopez Salvador Marquez AG Carlos Prieto Arturo Diaz Restori Salvador Marquez AH Leén Salinas Francisco Llamas Suarez | Salvador Marquez Al Radl Bailleres Manuel Lépez Salvador Marquez AJ Evaristo Araiza Arturo Diaz Restori Salvador Marquez In the following days there were some additional clarifications about the insurance and the method of payment, and changes such as including the initials S.A. also on the back and modify the antefirma of the “Government Inspector” by “Inspector of the Com. Nac. Bancaria. ” Even the SHCP sent permission to use their seal on the back, so the operation seemed confirmed. The new designs were sent to the Bank on July 19, 1946, to which it made minor changes in the following two months, in terms of engraving, which could have been done by W&S as seen on the Die proofs 17711 & 17847 of the portrait (figures 6 and 7), also attributed to J.A.C. Harrison by Mr. Spinella and requested details regarding the type of paper (which it seemed they were sending to examine separately) and the insurance. Figures 6 and 7 Benito Juarez Dies 17711 & 17847 most likely engraved by J.A.C. Harrison for W&S Carmelo Spinella © 2020 Porthole Publications While W&S prepared the engravings, the Bank sent the facsimile signatures of the aforementioned officials to be printed on the front and the seals on the back. However, at the end of the year the talks took an unexpected turn. Through a letter and a subsequent memorandum, I managed to find out that W&S made a significant adjustment to the INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 2952 -26- zx SEE mV ANWCO DE MEXKIC CC —— doopbobo— ee } Coney is ae ae mae ry Wee Secs ZN PLING uaa aaa sia sesteess sunny og] =* Ato Ee pas yiinase au WES Oe [POCFADOS o~ een reve (Y) rine SAGs De > Figure 8 Specimen #180. Banco de México Numismatic Collection price, in order to include the increase in wages decreed by the British government, which was rejected by the issuer. W&sS sent the engraved proofs for final approval to the Bank in late September. Most likely these are the specimens number 179 to 182 in the Numismatic Collection, corresponding to the series AJ, AG (shown in figure 8), AB and AA, respectively. On January 3, 1947, BdM wrote directly to W&S informing that the engraving seemed deficient and on the 14th of the same month, Mr. Maristany, probably after a meeting with officials, sent an extensive letter to its representee with precise indications regarding the portrait, backgrounds, borders, letter shading, stamps, and in general the quality of the print. Furthermore, on February 7, the Bank requested to suspend INTERNATIONAL BANK NOTE SOCIETY JOURNAL 59.4 the preparation of banknotes due to rumors in the public that led to the possibility of returning to circulation one peso silver coins that had ceased to be minted in 1945. It isn’t clear the real reason for the cancellation; in a note to Mexico’s Consulate in London, dated 1951 it says that the contract had been terminated because the Government had decided to mint silver coins, which were effectively put back into circulation with a different design (Morelos “cachetén” instead of the pesos “Resplandor”) and a lower fine by law (0.500 instead of 0.720), but at the Board meeting held on June 22, 1949, it was mentioned that it had been suspended because it was considered inconvenient to have banknotes with another design, because it had quite a few of the ABNC in its inventory and for other reasons.° 6 AHBanxico ACA #1292 In his book The Brotherhood of Money, Murray Teigh Bloom says that while in Guatemala, the ABNC representative for Mexico, Henry Meiggs Keith, was informed of the impending contract by his W&S counterpart for Latin America, the aforementioned Peter Mitchell. Concerned about the possibility of losing part of the Mexican market, he traveled to Mexico to find out about this order. According to Bloom himself, Keith convinced the Bank authorities, particularly Ing. Quiroz Cuardn, that the portrait of Benito Juarez prepared for these banknotes had European features and would not be well accepted.’ I haven't been able to find out if this approach led Bank to request those last changes to the portrait of Benito Juarez and eventually to cancel the printing. However, the contact between the Bank and W&S existed, since there are communications from the ABNC dated between August, and December 1946, where Mr. Keith mentions that his company carried out various tests on the banknote and its substrate, and concludes that the quality of the engraving and the security of its printing were inferior to ABNC’s, the price was not lower and deliveries from the USA were safer. He also had doubts about the actual composition of the paper used.§ Regardless of the efforts made by Mr. Keith, the Bank commissioned two separate analyzes on the quality and resistance of the paper of both companies to the paper factories Loreto and Pefia Pobre as well as San Rafael. The results were that ABNC’s was slightly better, but confirmed the composition offered by W&S, contrary to the insinuations by Mr. Keith. One peso banknotes bearing series AA to AJ finally were requested from the ABNC in May 1948. Naturally, W8&S demanded a financial compensation. In July 1947, Mr Maristany senta letter to the Bank requesting compensation of £ 43,075 for breach of contract and to defray the costs incurred. After few communications, this amount was reduced to £ 34,425, including the cost of the designs, plate engraving and proof production, 10% advance and compensation. Finally, in October of that year, by mutual agreement, it was established that the compensation would be £14,054.10, the W&S assuming the rest of the losses. Perhaps, W&S expected to be able to recover the contract one day, given that in 1951 new quotes appeared at a very low price, convenient due to the proposal to use paper and engravings from the 1946 issue. While there is no record of 7 Murray Teigh Bloom (1983), The Brotherhood of Money, pp 181-183. 8 AHBanxico C3916 Exp. 5 any response to this proposal, this and similar offers from other companies were used by the Bank’s management to negotiate a better price with ABNC , as related in various minutes of the Board. It could well be the case that after twenty years of exclusivity with the BdM the ABNC had a close relationship with its authorities and had influenced them to cancel the order. This company, probably through Mr. Keith who lived in Costa Rica, also tried to approach the Banco de Guatemala to return the favor to W&S, mentioning the cancellation of the contract in Mexico. Banco de Guatemala asked its Mexican counterpart if the cancellation was due to defects that could not be corrected and that it preferred to pay compensation rather than run the risk of issuing banknotes with inferior security and quality. The BdM responded that although it paid the compensation, the decision not to change the note was for psychological reasons among the population, in addition that the ABNC had been providing a good service, particularly during the war, and that the Bank was not in favor of issuing two identical bills with different imprints? (unlike Guatemala). It is worth ending by mentioning the fate of W&S. In 1961, it was acquired by Purnell and Sons, which soon after sold the banknote, stamp and check printing segment to its competitor De La Rue & Co. Ltd. It was officially dissolved in 2009. I don’t know whether among its files, sold by De la Rue in the early 1970s there are further information, models, vignettes or portraits related to this failed issue.
