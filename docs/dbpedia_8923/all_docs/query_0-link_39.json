Mauritius has long been part of an important trade route linking India, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The island’s remote location has led to a number of philatelic and numismatic rarities. For example, one of the rarest and most valuable postage stamps in the world, the so-called 1847 Blue Penny (Two Pence) stamp (along with a companion orange-red One Penny value) became the first British Empire postage stamp ever produced outside of Great Britain. Only a handful of the Blue Penny issue stamps is known, one of which was held by our consignor’s family for a period of time. The collection, which includes many bank note rarities from Mauritius, as well as notes from India and Zanzibar, has been intact for nearly 100 years. In that time, it has been held by the family of the consignor that has been part of the island’s history for nearly two centuries. Collections like this are rarely seen today. Some of the bank note highlights include: Government of Mauritius 5 Rupees 1.7.1924 Pick 16 This design was issued between 1907 and 1930, with 177,000 notes placed in circulation between 1924 and 1926. The notes were withdrawn from circulation at the end of 1934. This example is in far above average condition for this issue and, in fact, is tied with only one other note for the highest reported grade for this Pick number in the PMG population report. Government of Mauritius 10 Rupees 1.1.1927 Pick 17 235,000 of this large format denomination note were issued between 1924 and 1932, with all notes being withdrawn from circulation by 1934. Absent from many African and British Commonwealth collections, this note is difficult to find in any condition. At present, only nine notes have been graded by PMG, with this example being, by far, the finest graded and the only note to receive the grading services EPQ designation. Government of Mauritius 10 Rupees 7.8.1900 Pick 14 Around 568,458 of this denomination were issued between 1876 and 1904, with all notes being withdrawn from circulation in 1934.This design and denomination is difficult to locate in any grade. At present, this is the only example graded by PMG. Government of Mauritius 10 Rupees 1.5.1913 Pick 17 This design was issued between 1907 and 1930, with around 265,000 notes placed in circulation between 1913 and 1921 before being withdrawn from circulation at the end of 1934. PMG only records nine examples of this note design and denomination in its population report. Government of Mauritius 5 Rupees 30.8.1909 Pick 16 323,000 notes of this design were issued between 1907 and 1911, ultimately being withdrawn from circulation on December 15, 1934. Like the other notes highlighted here, this note is rare and seldom offered, with even the date being unlisted in the standard references. Zanzibar Government 10 Rupees 1.1.1908 Pick 3 Notes from this exotic locale have seen increasing popularity and interest as collectors specializing in Africa seek to add an example to their collections. PMG lists only five examples of this design in their population report.

Featuring the signature of William C. Allen, this note was issued in or around 1980, and was replaced by a completely redesigned type in 1984. This denomination has become challenging to find in any sort of collect- ible grade, as its short life span and high face value prevented most from being saved for posterity. This example displays pack fresh original quali- ties, such a uncirculated paper, vivid colors, and clean, wide margins. At the time of cataloging, the PMG Population Report has graded only 14 examples in Uncirculated grades, which is surprisingly low for a 1980s issued banknote.

Colorful, beautifully designed, and seldom seen today; this highest denomination type is widely sought after, especially in such an impressive state of preserva- tion. At the time of cataloging, only one example grades finer in the PMG Population Report. This denomination was initially conceived due to inflation and the depreciation of the Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Bradbury, Wilkinson & Company prepared 300,000 banknotes, but release was slightly delayed due to a technical issue with the security strip. Finally issued in November of 1964, this denomination was initially unpopular, but gained usefulness when the pound was devalued in 1967. However, in 1969, Bermuda announced the change from Pounds to Dollars in decimalized form, which would void the older banknotes. Serial numbers 000,001 to 250,000 were issued, with the final 50,000 supposedly destroyed. This example, with utterly impressive pack fresh original quality, bears a serial number from the supposedly unissued stock. A forward thinking person with access to banknotes in Hamilton must have saved this beautiful example as a souvenir, and thankfully so. An important Queen Elizabeth IJ offering and desirable in this lofty grade.

Eisenhauer Collection ome of the most remarkable collections are built by the collectors and researchers that give back to the hobby most. Harry M. Eisenhauer is no exception. Harry specialized in Canadian Chartered Banknotes, with a particular focus on the Eastern Provinces of Canada. Over 50 years of collecting, he was able to acquire some of the most spectacular rarities from Nova Scotia, New Brusnwick, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. The Bank of Canada notes offered here today are among the finest known, many from the first ten notes issues of their respective type. Harry started collecting at the age of nine in 1947. He was drawn to the engravings on stamps, naturally leading to an interest in Canadian banknotes. He ardently shared his passion with others, serving fellow collectors and advancing the hobby through his activities in numismatics. He is Life Member No. 16 of the Canadian Paper Money Society, and served as the first Vice President and Membership Director, later serving as President. He also served as President and a founding member in the Atlantic Provinces Numismatic Association and Fredericton Numismatic Society. Beyond numismatics, Harry is a founding patron of the J. Douglas Ferguson Education and Research Foundation, and Farmers Bank of Rustico Museum. Education was important to Harry, as he served as a frequent speaker, convention chairman and moderator of many an educational symposium at local, regional, and national events. Harry lent a hand to Bob Graham, contributing significantly to the Canadian Paper Money Society Note Registry for more than 30 years. His notes were listed, and are undoubtedly on want lists for many a specialists, waiting for this offering today. Harry also served as a contributor to the Charlton catalogs, both for research and market pricing. His lifelong endeavors have earned him honorary life memberships in The Halifax Regional Coin Club, Ingersoll Coin Club, and Prince Edward Island Numismatic Association. In 1973, he was awarded the Dale Garland Award. Harry helped shape Canadian banknote collecting, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. Today's offering is the first time that many collectors will have a chance to compete for Chartered banknote rarities, and the conditions of the representative survivors are in many cases, unequaled. sy Rare $2 1878 28046 Canada Dominion of Canada $2 1.6.1878 DC-9b PCGS Fine 12.
