"We are going to be naming Roy Webb as our new superintendent of schools in the Hannibal Public Schools."

Roy Webb has 33 years of experience in education, recently serving as superintendent of Quincy Public School District from 2015-2022.

Webb was instrumental in leading an $89 million project to build five new schools while at QPS and was helped the district through many difficult transitions, including the pandemic.

Hannibal Board of Education President Blane Mundle says with all Webb accomplished just across the state line, this was the perfect fit.

"Mr. Webb has a tremendous reputation," said Blane Mundle president of Board of education for HPS. "He is an honest man, a trustworthy man, a man that has led many school districts as a superintendent and his credentials were impeccable."

Webb will be taking the role of superintendent following the retirement of current superintendent Susan Johnson.

Mundle says going from a great leader such as Johnson to Webb is special.

"It means continuation of greatness. To go from a fantastic superintendent like Mrs. Johnson to a fantastic superintendent like Mr. Webb is just great for Hannibal," said Mundle.

Webb says his plans are to come in and continue to build off of what Johnson started--a leader not just for the school, but for the entire community.

"It's the same thing, not just for the staff and the students, but also the community," said Webb. "I'm actually working for you. I'm there as their resource."

He says that will start with good communication.

"I think I have been pretty responsive with emails, with having meetings, with having communication and taking phone calls," Webb said.

Webb says he can't wait to start building relationships and making HPS the best district it can be.

"I'm looking forward to having those conversations and if they see things or something that's out of place, if they reach out to me and I'll be able to help them."
