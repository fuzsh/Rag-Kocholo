        "text": "Thomas Gerald Webb was born on 13 September 1869 in Petrolia, Ontario to John Webb and Mary Jane Anderson. His siblings were Frances (1858-1940), John (1859-1937), James Henry (1862-1913), Samuel Simon (1863-1935), Elizabeth (Lizzie) (1865-1909), Mary Jane (Jennie) (b 1868), William M (1871-1936), Jessie (Jane) (b 1872), Emma (1875-1897), Nellie (1877-1950), Bertha (1882-1915) and Burleigh (b 1882). The Webb family lived in Petrolia, Ontario in 1871, Middlesex Co, Ontario in 1881 and Edfrid Township, Middlesex Co, Ontario in 1891. Thomas married Sarah âKatherineâ (Kitty) Mitchell on 28 April 1897 in St Thomas, Ontario. She was born on 27 May 1876 in Napier, Ontario to William Mitchell and Mary Catherine (Kate) Everson. Her siblings were Jonathon âWilliamâ (John) (1862-1926), Mary Eliza (1865-1935), Maria Jane (Jennie) 1868-1918), Samuel Levi (1869-1930) and James Wesley (b 1873).\n\nThe Mitchell family lived in Metcalfe Township, Middlesex Co, Ontario in 1881 and in Enniskillen Township, Lambton County, Ontario in 1891. A son, Thomas âGeraldâ (Gerry) Webb was born to Kitty and Thomas on 5 August 1897 in Bothwell, Ontario. 1901 and 1911 found the Webb family living in St Thomas, Ontario. In 1891, Thomas was a farmer, in 1901 an agricultural labourer and in 1911 a labourer. By 1916, the family had moved to 1027 Aird St, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan where Thomas was a caretaker at the court house. By 1921, they had moved into the courthouse on 21st St E where Thomas was still a caretaker. Thomas died on 6 May 1951 and Kitty on 3 May 1954, both in Saskatoon. They were both buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\nGerry enlisted on 11 April 1916 with a Winnipeg unit, the 183rd Battalion. He saw service overseas with the Canadian Engineers. In 1921 he was a cashier, but according to his obituary was a stenographer for the high courts from time to time and operated Webb Multigraphing Service after returning from the war. He was taken ill with a lingering illness several years before his death which occurred in Saskatoon on 21 November 1930. He was also buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\nAlthough there is some doubt as to the identity of the woman who signed her name, Cassie Mitchell, the only candidate that could be found for the signature was Mary Catherine (Kate) Everson who was born on 13 July 1843 in Chippawa, Ontario and married William Mitchell (born in 1843, Ontario) on 20 September 1862 in Middlesex County, Ontario. Cassie was a common nickname for Catherine and two of Kateâs daughters signed the quilt. Her daughter, Kitty was living in Saskatoon and another daughter, Mary Eliza Mitchell (Stokes) was living in Winnipeg at quilt signing time. It was likely that Kate was also living in Winnipeg at that time as she died there on 6 May 1920. She could easily have been in Saskatoon for a visit, possibly with the Stokes family, and may have signed the quilt at that time.\n\nThomas Blunt Stokes was born on 14 September 1860 in Lambton, Ontario to Arthur Stokes and Elizabeth Hendra. His siblings were Mary Jane (1863-1900), Elizabeth Ann (1865-1948), William Henry (1868-1944), Edith (1870-1961), Arthur (1873-1888), Amelia (Millie) (1875-1913), Emma (1877-1877), John Earnest (1880-1943) and Lilian May (Lillie) (1885-1912). The Stokes family lived in various places in Lambton Co, Ontario from 1861 to 1881 â Sarnia (1861), Oil Springs (1871) and Enniskillen (1881). Thomas married Elizabeth Alice Holbrook on 25 October 1884 in Oil City, Ontario. She was born in 1865 in Watford, Lambton, Ontario to William Holbrook and Sarah Jane. Their children were Florence (1885-1929), Harry Hendra (1887-1945), Thomas Bluett (1889-1970), Alice Rebecca (1890-1893) and William âArthurâ (1895-1915).\n\nIn 1891, they were living in Enniskillen. Elizabeth died on 28 October 1895 in Lambton, Ontario. Thomas married Mary Eliza Mitchell on 3 July 1896. She was born on 14 February 1865 in Ontario to William Mitchell and Catherine Everson (discussed above). She was first married to Richard Kingston who was born in London, Ontario in 1857 to Richard Kingston and Agnes Alexander. She had two children, Richard (1889-1936) and Clifford John who was born in St Thomas, Ontario on 11 January 1893. It is likely that Richard Sr. Kingston died on 12 January 1890 in Metcalfe Township, Middlesex County, Ontario as Mary was listed as a widow in the 1891 census and this death record fits his age of 33 at the time of his death. Cliffordâs surname was given as Stokes in most census records, suggesting that Thomas Stokes adopted him. Cliffordâs birth date was too late for him to be a child of Richard Kingston, but his surname was given as Kingston in the 1901 census.\n\nSamuel âErnestâ Stokes was born to Thomas and Mary on 1 February 1897 in St Thomas, Elgin, Ontario and Edith âPearlâ Stokes was born on 8 May 1899 in Elgin, Ontario. In 1901, the family which consisted of Thomas Sr (Railway brakeman), Mary, Florence, Harry, Thomas Jr, William, Ernest and Pearl Stokes plus Richard and Clifford Kingston was living in St Thomas. In 1909 Thomas Sr (Pumper at an oil field), Mary, Clifford (labourer at an oil field), Ernest and Pearl immigrated to the USA and were enumerated in Bixby, Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1910. At this time, Clifford was using the surname Stokes. By 1911, the entire family was living in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Richard (driller with provincial government) was still using the surname Kingston and Clifford (barber), the surname Stokes. Thomas Sr was a driller with the provincial government, Ernest an elevator operator for the same and Arthur a molder- iron worker. Clifford and Ernest were still in Winnipeg with their parents at the time of the 1921 census. Mary died in Regina, Saskatchewan on 13 October 1935 and Thomas died in an unknown location in August 1955.\n\nHarry Hendra Stokes was born on 18 June 1887 in Kent, Ontario. He married Cora Mary McKinley on 9 December 1907 in York, Ontario. She was born on 15 April 1888 in Durham, Ontario to William McKinley and Mary Glass. They had six children, Cora (b 1907), Margery Marguerette Alberta (b 1908), Harold William Thomas (1910-1978), Roy Harrison (1914-1976), Donald (1915-1979) and Mary Isabel (1920-1988). In 1916 and 1921, the family was living in Gladstone, Manitoba where Harry was a driller of oil wells for the provincial government. Harry & Cora died in Winnipeg on 3 July 1945 and in 1958, respectively.\n\nClifford John Stokes enlisted for WWI on 26 August 1915 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His birth year was impossible to read â may have been 1894 or 1896 â 1894 matches other records the best. There is a Manitoba marriage record for Clifford John Kingston Stokes and Berthia McMillan Mercer on 13 February 1926 in Winnipeg, Manitoba that most likely belongs to him. However, this could not be verified in other trees.\n\nPearl married James Nathaniel Wickett on 10 July 1920 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was born on 3 November 1896 in Haldimand, Ontario to Lewis Edward Wickett and Margaret Ann McBride. His siblings were Cora MacBride (1891-1973), Gertrude Elizabeth (b 1894), Lewis E (b 1898), Oscar Harris (b 1902), Russell Franklin (b 1905) and Gladys M (b 1908). James lived with his family in Manitoba until at least 1911 â Winnipeg (1901), Brandon (1906) and Winnipeg (1911). The 1921 census found James (salesman) and Pearl living in Winnipeg. James died on 25 December 1964 in Vancouver, British Columbia. At the time of his death he was married to Bertha Wright. They had at least one son, Garry who was born in 1940. Nothing more is known about Pearl.\n\nThe name of James Wickett was signed immediately under the name of Pearl Stokes on the quilt and all of the Stokes family signed in the same area of the quilt. They were possibly in Saskatoon visiting Maryâs sister, Kitty and her husband Thomas Webb when they signed.\n\nAlthough conclusive proof could not be found, it is believed that Thomas Webbâs brother, John Webb who was born in Exeter, Middlesex, Ontario on 10 June 1859 and his wife, Mary Ann Hazel who was born on 2 March 1859 in Michigan, USA were the signers of the names John and Molly Webb. These names were signed directly under each other on the quilt, suggesting the signers were related. Although no document could be found where Mary used the name Molly, this couple very likely lived in Saskatchewan and Maryâs sister, Emma Delilah Hazel and brother in law George Bott definitely were signers. In 1911, George and Emma Bott were farming NW-32-31-22-W3 (grant issued 12 December 1913) and John and Mary Webb, SW of the same section (grant issued 1 April 1914). The age and birth information for John and Mary were a very good match for the brother of Thomas Webb and the sister of Emma Hazel (Bott).\n\nThe early life of John Webb was discussed above. He married Mary Ann Hazel, the daughter of Jonathon (John) Hazel (1833-1916) and Sarah Reid (1832-1913) in Petrolia, Ontario on 16 June 1887. In 1891, he was working in a livery stable and from 1911 to 1921, he was a farmer. The siblings of Mary were: Alice Jane (b 1861), Isabella Agnes (1862-1929), Emma Delilah (1864-1943), Edmund Jonah (b 1867), Ellsworth George (b 1868) and Adah C (b 1873). The Hazel family lived in Petrolia, Ontario in 1871. It appeared that John and Mary had no children. They lived in Lambton, Ontario in 1891 and were most likely the people who moved to the homestead described earlier by the time of the 1911 census. They were still farming that land at the time of the 1921 census. John died on 17 January 1937 at an unknown location. Mary Ann died in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 29 March 1942. Both are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Saskatoon.\n\nEmma Delilah Hazel was born on 3 April 1864 in Lake Port, Michigan. She married George Bott in Petrolia on 6 October 1887. He was born in Brington, Northamptonshire, England on 29 January 1861 to George Bott (1834-1889) and Jane Tarpley (1835-1913). His siblings were: Martha Elisabeth (b 1856), Mary Ann (b 1858), Charles C (b 1859), John Carter (1863-1942), Edward Tarpley (1867-1922), Charlotte (Lottie) (1870-1904), Frances Jane (Fanny) (b 1871), Ellen Rebecca (b 1874) and William James (b 1877). At the time of the 1871 census, the Bott family was in Brington, England.\n\nThey departed Glasgow, Scotland aboard SS âNova Scotianâ about 20 June 1871 and arrived in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada on 3 July 1871. The 1881 census found them in Thorah Township, Ontario County, Ontario. In 1883, George received $6 for the period of 18-29 September in the militia in the 24th Regiment, Ontario. George and Emma had a daughter, Adah May born on 5 January 1889 in Perth, Ontario. In 1891, the Bott family lived in London, Ontario where George was a railway brakeman. Emmaâs sister, Adah Hazel was living with them. They had a stillborn male child in 1893.\n\n1901 found the family in Petrolia, Ontario where George was a merchant with his own business. He had earned $600 the previous year. 1911 found them on their homestead in Saskatchewan. By 1921, they were living in Winnipeg, Manitoba where George was a tax accountant. George and Emma were living with their daughter Adah and son in law, Harry Stenberg. George died on 1 June 1938 and Emma on 20 November 1943, both in Winnipeg. Sometime between 1911 and 1921, Adah married Harry Edwards Stenberg who was born on 8 May 1889 in London, Ontario to William T Stenberg (b 1848) and Emma L (b 1860). Harry worked as a salesman and then a sales manager for a variety of companies that supplied stationery requirements to businesses in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Harry and Emma had one daughter who was born in 1922. To respect her privacy, she has not been named here.\n\nThis complex family tree can be found on Ancestry under the title\n\n3rd Ave Bott/Stenberg/Stokes/Webb/Wickett Tree."
