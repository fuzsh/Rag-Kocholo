Piecing together my MATTHEWS roots in Brinkworth has therefore proved somewhat challenging! However, I feel obliged to include some details about the family on my website, and I have done my best to piece together the evidence I have ...\n\nAcknowledgements & Disclaimer\n\nThis webpage would not have been possible without CLIVE HENLY's transcriptions of the Brinkworth Parish Registers. I am also grateful to MIRIAM SAUNDERS, LESLIE MATTHEWS, MANDY MATTHEWS, GRAHAM PRICE, DAVE MATTHEWS and EVELINE BUNCE for providing information about Eleanor, Elizabeth, Edward, John and Ada MATTHEWS; JOHN BURROWS, MARGARET BISSETT, PAT POWER and GARRY GASCOIGNE for providing details about the family of Robert MATTHEWS and Fanny NORTH; COLLEEN WEBB for information about Henry WEBB, including the photos of Henry, his wife Emily and son William, and LESLIE and HEATHER REASON for providing lots of interesting details about Friend MATTHEWS and his family. I would also like to thank PAT BULLEY for her Brinkworth burial transcriptions as well as PAUL VIVASH, STAN MAPSTONE, JIM FISHER and ANN PARFITT for providing extracts from various sources with regard to the derivation of the names \"MATTHEWS\" and \"WEBB\". I am also grateful to the members of the Wessex Genealogy Mailing List, as well as the Bristol, Chippenham and Swindon Register Offices. The photographs on this page come from my own family album with the exception of the photo of George Albert MATTHEWS which was kindly donated by my cousin Sue HANMORE. Much of the information on this page has no primary source and while I believe that it is accurate, I cannot take responsibility for any errors or omissions. I will be updating this page regularly as new information comes to light.\n\nMeaning Of The Names\n\nAccording to the \"The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland\", MATTHEWS is a variant of the name MATTHEW with a genitival (i.e. possessive) or superfluous \"-s\". The surname MATTHEW is a relationship name (i.e. derived from a relative, typically the father) from the Middle English personal name MATHEW which in turn comes the Hebrew MATTATHIAH meaning \"gift of Jehovah\". The name was introduced into England by the Normans and early examples include MATHIU and MATHEUS which both appear in the Domesday Book of 1086.\n\nThe surnames WEBB and WEBBER both originate from the Old English \"webba\" or \"webbe\" meaning \"weaver\". Early examples include Jernagon, Osbert and Wigor WEBBE (Suffolk, 1221), Elyas le WEBBE (Oxfordshire, 1255), Alice la WEBBE (Court Rolls of the Borough of Colchester, 1337) and Rogerus WEBBE (Poll Tax in Banbury, Oxfordshire 1379 Poll Tax). This is also from the \"The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland\" by PATRICK HANKS, RICHARD COATES and PETER McCLURE.\n\nBrinkworth Parish Church\n\n(click image to enlarge)\n\nThomas MATTHEWS (1781-1851)\n\nThomas MATTHEWS was baptised on 28th January 1781 in Brinkworth, Wiltshire.

His uncles George and William had sons called Hezekiah and Jacob, and on the night of 27th December 1883 three cousins from Callow Hill in Brinkworth decided to go hunting in Sir John NEALD's game preserve in Braydon Big Wood - they were Hezekiah, Jacob and Richard MATTHEWS. The three men were caught by the gamekeeper and his colleagues, and a fracas ensued during which Hezekiah was struck on the head with a bludgeon by Henry John REEVES. The cousins were eventually secured but as their captors were collecting their weapons Henry's younger brother Thomas accidentally fired a shotgun, hitting his brother in the arm and his father in the face. Hezekiah, Jacob and Richard were taken to Cricklade Police Station, arriving there early on the morning of the 28th. Hezekiah was examined by Dr. LANGLEY who immediately sent him to Purton Cottage Hospital, where he later died from his injuries. Henry John REEVES was subsequently charged with manslaughter while Jacob and Richard MATTHEWS were sent to Devizes Gaol for six weeks' hard labour. While there is no direct evidence that my great-great-grandfather was the Richard MATTHEWS involved in these unfortunate events, the fact that he had cousins called Hezekiah and Jacob make it seem very likely that he was.\n\nEmma MATTHEWS (nee WEBB) died of pulmonary phthisis on 16th May 1891 in Brinkworth aged just 31 and was buried on 26th May of the same year.

The 1939 Register shows Edward and Florence MATTHEWS living in Callow Hill with Edward's occupation recorded as 'government work'.\n\nAccording to his son Leslie, Edward frequented auctions and bought all manner of items. On one occasion he purchased a carpet that had come from Malmesbury Abbey which he cut up and used to insulate outbuildings. Leslie said it was surprisingly effective, even in the coldest depths of Winter. Edward died at 3 Callow Hill, Brinkworth on 14th December 1955 and his widow Florence died on 22nd December 1967 also at 3 Callow Hill.\n\nJohn MATTHEWS Gallery\n\n(click image to view)\n\nJohn MATTHEWS (b. 1884) married Mary Alice SMITH on 14th October 1905 in Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire.

Her husband John died in 1968 and was buried in the same church on 31st December.\n\nWilliam MATTHEWS (1888-1957)\n\nWilliam MATTHEWS Gallery\n\n(click image to view)\n\nWilliam MATTHEWS was born on 5th July 1888 in Brinkworth, Wiltshire, and was the youngest son of Richard MATTHEWS and Emma WEBB. He played the tuba in the Callow Hill band with his older brothers Edward and John. William married Amy Gwendoline \"Gwennie\" CURTIS on 23rd June 1915 in St Paul, Bristol. Gwennie was born on 29th January 1892 at 97 Clarence Road, Bedminster, Bristol, and was the daughter of Frank CURTIS and Elizabeth MATTHEWS.\n\nThe MATTHEWS and CURTIS families\n\n(click image to enlarge)\n\nGwennie and William had five children together - Alfred William Hippesley, born 15th July 1916 in High Street, Purton, Wiltshire; Elizabeth Eleanor Mary, born 21st October 1917 at 46 Martin Street, St Paul, Bristol; Eleanor Elizabeth, born 13th February 1920 at 46 Martin Street; Mary Olive, born 3rd February 1922 at 46 Martin Street, and George Albert, born 11th April 1928 at 46 Martin Street. Sadly, born Elizabeth Eleanor Mary MATTHEWS and Eleanor Elizabeth MATTHEWS died in childhood - Elizabeth died of catarrhal jaundice on 15th October 1918 at 46 Martin Street, just six days short of her first birthday, while Eleanor died of tuberculous meningitis on 12th August 1922 at the Bristol Children's Hospital, aged 2. They were both interred at Greenbank Cemetery.\n\nGwennie MATTHEWS (nee CURTIS)\n\n(click image to enlarge)\n\nWilliam worked as a farm labourer before the outbreak of World War One. It appears that he was declared unfit for service in November 1915 due to an inguinal hernia, however he was called up for service on 25th July 1918 and posted to the 17th Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment. The Battalion was based in England until the end of the war. William was posted to the 18th Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment on 1st December 1918 before being transferred to the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment on 5th December 1918. The men of this battalion were Pioneers which meant that as well as being trained soldiers they also carried out basic engineering tasks such as building field fortifications, military camps, bridges and roads. William played the tuba in the Hampshire Pioneer band. He was subsequently transferred to the 2nd/8th Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment, possibly on 31st March 1919, but by July of that year he was serving with the 2nd/6th Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was demobilized back to England on 14th November 1919 and transferred to the army reserve on 13th December 1919.\n\nWilliam's exact movements during the period from December 1918 through to his demob in November 1919 are not clear, though it is known that he was in France during some of this time as a photo exists of him with the Hampshire Regiment apparently taken in Dieppe, and in August 1919 he sent a postcard to his wife Gwennie with the title \"A Kiss From France\". He was probably involved in the clean-up operation after the war, and his service record also indicates that in September 1919 he was posted to the 139 P.O.W. Company which would have been responsible for guarding prisoners of war. William was finally discharged from the army on 31st March 1920. This is how the family appears in the 1921 census (they were living at the same address as Gwennie's parents Frank and Elizabeth CURTIS):\n\n46 Martin Street, St Paul, Bristol\n\nWilliam MATTHEWS aged 32 years 11 months General Labourer (John Shute & Co.

William served as an Air Raid Precautions Warden in World War Two. It seems that William and Gwennie bought both 45 and 47 Martin Street in 1953. William died on 23rd January 1957 in Ham Green Hospital. Gwennie MATTHEWS worked as a domestic servant in Clifton, Bristol and died on 11th March 1959 at her home at 46 Martin Street, St Paul. After Gwennie's death, 45 and 47 Martin Street were sold to Mr. H. D. McLEAN in May 1959, and 46 Martin Street was sold to Alexander KOLATEY in June 1959.\n\nWilliam and Gwennie MATTHEWS\n\n(click image to enlarge)\n\nAlfred William Hippesley MATTHEWS (b. 1916) was known to all as \"Roy\". In the 1920s he attended the North Street Wesleyan School in Backfields, Stokes Croft and later Castle Green School. On a Certificate of Character for Castle Green School dated 25th July 1930, it was noted that Alfred was \"a steady worker who may be relied upon to carry a job through to a finish\". He met Winifred Ivy SMITH in January 1935 while working at Fred Phillips, a drapers at 217 Gloucester Road, Bishopston. Roy made the fixtures for the shop while Win worked as a shop assistant. Win was born on 23rd December 1920 and is the daughter of Frederick Joseph SMITH and Mary Ann BODDY. Roy and Win married on 10th April 1939 in Horfield Parish Church, Bristol.\n\nDuring World War Two Roy worked for the Bristol Aeroplane Company at Rodney Works, Filton. Due to the important nature of his work he was not permitted to enlist in the Army so instead joined the Home Guard, in which he served until 1956, by which time he had reached the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. After the war he became a lorry driver and then worked as a panel beater at Henlys Ltd, an Austin/British Motor Corporation garage and dealership on the corner of Cheltenham Road and Bath Buildings, and at Tuckers Radiator Services at 329 Gloucester Road. He then became a coach builder at Davies & Sons Funeral Directors before joining Rolls-Royce in about 1959 where he worked as an aircraft fitter until his retirement in 1981.
