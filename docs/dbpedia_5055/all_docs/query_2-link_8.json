        "text": "HANNIBAL, Mo. — In a unanimous decision of the Hannibal Public School Board this afternoon, Roy Webb was named as Hannibal school’s new superintendent.\n\nWebb retired in 2022 after serving as the Superintendent of the Quincy Public School District since 2015. Webb has 33 years of experience in the education field.\n\nWebb will replace Susan Johnson who is retiring in June after more than thirty years of service to the Hannibal Public School District. Webb will assume his role as superintendent on July 1.\n\nWebb said one of his first priorities will be to learn more about Missouri law and practices after many years as an Illinois superintendent. He will also familiarize himself with things going on in Hannibal.\n\n“Some things are different. Like you know, the Missouri law is different from Illinois law and things like that, but some things are the same. Teachers love kids, they’re there for kids and they’re amazing human beings, our support staff are there for kids looking out for their welfare, and kids are the same no matter where you go,” he said.\n\nWebb said the position wasn’t on his radar until a search committee reached out to him.\n\n“I knew a little bit about Hannibal, and I knew it was a good school district and very well run. Susan Johnson has done an amazing job. Anytime there’s a great superintendent I know that there’s a lot of really good people helping and supporting her,” Webb said. “This is a great opportunity to be part of a fantastic school district.”\n\nDuring his 18 months of retirement, Webb said he discovered “I suck at retirement.”\n\nJust after he retired, Webb moved to Tennessee with hopes of hiking but he found it boring. He then tried out various other jobs but found nothing as fulfilling as education.\n\n“So I became a bus driver. Then I was a basketball official, and then an airport ramp agent handling baggage. None of those made the impact of being an educator and working with teachers and kids and being part of a community,” he said. “I love the job of superintendent and this is a great opportunity for me.”\n\nBlane Mundle, president of the Hannibal Public School Board, said Webb is the “the right person at the right time to lead our district into the future.” Mundle praised Webb as an “honest man, a trustworthy man, a man that has led many school districts as a superintendent and his credentials are impeccable.”\n\n“We love our students, and we wanted to give them the best opportunity to have someone who would build a relationship with our students and build a relationship with our community,” Mundle continued. “And we know that Mr. Webb has done that in Quincy and every place that he has been.”\n\nMundle also commended Susan Johnson’s work in the district.\n\n“She gave our district and led our district in a way that was respectful, trustworthy, and led our curriculum and our improvements and you know, you look at the facilities in Hannibal and the Hannibal public schools,” he said. “We have the greatest facilities in northeast Missouri, in my opinion.”\n\nWebb has signed a two-year contract and the school district reports his salary will be finalized next week."
