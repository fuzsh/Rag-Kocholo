        "text": "The surname La Roy was first found in Brittany, where this eminent family held a family seat since ancient times.\n\nPierre du Roaiz is recorded in the cartulary of the hospitaliers (Religious orders who care for the sick and destitute) of Puy in 1181. Due to his great contributions to his community, Jean Roays was granted knighthood in 1253 and in 1261. In 1357, Robert Roays rendered homage for his fief to the Baron of Solignac and then in 1457 Jean III Roays carried out the same act to the Viscount Joyeuse, Baron of Saint-Didier-en-Velay. From this family came Simonnet des Roys, Lord of Roys, co-Lord of Brignon and Magistrate and Captain of the military. Actively involved in the Crusades, Etienne and Gilbert Roys were honored with the title of the Knights of Malta for their valiant action.\n\nValentin des Roys made a transaction with his brother on June 6, 1503, regarding the succession of their parents. From Valentin's marriage to Marie of Bourdelles, came the Marquis of Roys, the Lords of Eschandelys and the Barons of Enclos.\n\nIn 1684, Jacques, Marquis of Roys, rendered homage to the King. Following his noble descendants was Claude Annet, First Page to Louis XV and to Louis XVI, Captain of the Dauphiné cavalry, who obtained Honours from the Court in 1785. Etienne, his son, Marquis of Roys, married Jenny Hoche, daughter of the famous General, in 1832, and their son, Ernest, was the Auditor, a member of the State Council and the Deputy of la Seine-Inférieure.\n\nOne of the earliest records of the name Roy in Canada was with Etienne Roy, son of Mathurin and Marguerite (neé Bire) of La Rochelle. Etienne married Marguerite Navarre on 26th August 1669 and he died in Charlesbourg, Quebec and was buried on 1st March 1690. 1\n\nMigration of the La Roy family\n\nMigration from France to New France or Quebec as it was now more popularly called, continued from France until it fell in 1759. By 1675, there were 7000 French in Quebec. By the same year the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had reached 500. In the treaty of Utrecht, the Acadians were ceded by France to Britain in 1713. In 1755, 10,000 French Acadians refused to take an oath of allegiance to England and were deported. They found refuge in Louisiana. In 1793, the remaining French in these provinces came under British rule. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the French race flourished, founding in Lower Canada, one of the two great solitudes which became Canada. Many of this distinguished family name La Roy were prominent in social, cultural, religious and political affairs in France and New France. Amongst the settlers in North America with this distinguished name La Roy were G. B. Roys settled in San Francisco in 1850; J. Roys settled in San Francisco in 1852; Robert Royse settled with his wife, Elizabeth, in Massachusetts in 1630."
