Jessica Ellen Thomson due to the phone number being found in a book and neighbors allegedly reporting that a man had been door knocking asking them about her\n\nWhen South Australian Police took the nurse to see a plaster cast of the corpse, she asserted that she did not know him, although she almost fainted at the sight of the cast. She did state that she gave a copy of the same book to an Alf Boxall a few years before, but he was found to be alive and well.\n\nSome people have nominated various persons who they thought was Somerton Man, however none had proven to be him\n\nhttps://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LR91-P4B/carl-webb-1906\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/26/australia/australia-somerton-man...\n\nExcert\n\nSomerton man mystery 'solved' as DNA points to man's identity, professor claims\n\nBy Hilary Whiteman, CNN\n\nUpdated 0946 GMT (1746 HKT) July 26, 2022\n\nBrisbane, Australia (CNN)A professor who has dedicated decades to solving one of Australia's most enduring mysteries claims he has discovered the identity of the Somerton man.\n\nDerek Abbott, from the University of Adelaide, says the body of a man found on one of the city's beaches in 1948 belonged to Carl \"Charles\" Webb, an electrical engineer and instrument maker born in Melbourne in 1905.\n\nSouth Australia Police and Forensic Science South Australia have not verified the findings of Abbott, who worked with renowned American genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick to identify Webb as the Somerton man.\n\nForensic Science SA declined to comment and referred CNN to SA Police, who said there were no updates and that police would provide further comment \"when results from the testing are received.\"\n\nUsing DNA sequencing, Abbott says he and Fitzpatrick were able to locate the final piece of a puzzle that has captivated historians, amateur sleuths, and conspiracy theorists for more than 70 years.\n\nLast May, South Australia police responded to Abbott's calls to exhume the Somerton man's body and experts at Forensic Science SA started work to try to find the best way to analyze his DNA.\n\nBut in the end, Abbott, a professor in the Adelaide University School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, claims it was strands of the man's hair trapped in a plaster \"death\" mask made by police in the late 1940s that provided him with what he says is proof of the man's identity.\n\nPolice gave Abbott strands of the hair a decade ago as he continued what had become a personal quest to solve the Somerton man mystery. The hair was examined for years by a team of DNA experts at the University of Adelaide, who provided the DNA information that allowed Abbott and Fitzpatrick to further narrow the field.\n\nBy March, Abbott said he had already established Webb's name through years of painstaking work with Fitzpatrick to build a complex family tree of around 4,000 names that led to Webb, whose date of death had not been recorded.\n\n\"By filling out this tree, we managed to find a first cousin three times removed on his mother's side,\" said Abbott. And on July 23, they matched DNA obtained from the hair to DNA tests taken by Webb's distant relatives...."
