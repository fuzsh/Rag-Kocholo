        "text": "\"It took Dr.Webb 10 minutes to start me on a treatment plan for a condition Iâve been struggling with for 6 years. Iâve seen multiple doctors in multiple states and none of them could help me. Highly recommend Dr. Webb! I cannot thank him enough for taking my health and peace of mind seriously!\"\n\n\"Dr. Webb is not only a professional doctor in his field, but also a very personable one; especially to our family! He treated my dad in 2004 as an oncologist when he was diagnosed with star 3 lung cancer (Iâm blessed to say he is still with us to this day!), and treated me as an oncologist on 2020 when I had an extremely enlarged spleen that had to be removed, and now as my hemotologiat to keep an eye on my labs and such. We think Dr. Webb is knowledgeable in these areas and I always recommend him when anyone asks. He truly is a great doctor and a wonderful Christian man!\""
