        "text": "I don’t mind striking out my first time at bat. It takes away the pressure of a perfect season. —My decades-old memory of something said by a MLB player\n\nWhen I resumed my blog in January after a hiatus of several months to work on another project my goal was to publish an essay a week until June for a total of about 25 posts.\n\nSoon I was writing two essays a week, and then beginning in March I decided to stretch myself to a post a day for a month.\n\nI didn’t know then that this experiment would extend for 3 months and more than 90 consecutive daily posts, a total that far exceeded my expectations and at this point has created a pressure of its own to have a “perfect season” that I didn’t’ feel in the first few weeks.\n\nMore than once I have asked myself why at this time in my life I want to continue to write for publication, and this is how I respond:\n\nI write to better understand topics that interest me, especially those that too often are treated superficially.\n\nI write because it makes me more attentive throughout the day to what I’m reading and observing, an attentiveness that enriches my life.\n\nI write for an hour or two early each morning because I enjoy the slow, contemplative time that routine provides. The most enjoyable part is watching my thinking evolve as I write.\n\nI publish what I write because when I write for an audience I strive to be as clear and precise as possible. And because I prefer to “write short” to focus my thinking, every word counts. For me, that is the most challenging part of the process. (One of my favorite books about writing is How to Write Short by Roy Peter Clark.)\n\nI publish what I write in the hope that what I learn may also be of value to readers, perhaps providing a fresh perspective on a familiar topic.\n\nNot surprisingly, the things that are important to me in my 70s are different from those in previous decades, although I remain very interested in how people of all ages, by themselves and with others, learn and create, find purpose, and persevere when it would be easier to quit.\n\nSo, like the baseball player who wants to avoid the pressure of a perfect season at bat, it is time to take a break in my streak to find a more sustainable pace.\n\nI will begin again in the near future with a less demanding schedule."
