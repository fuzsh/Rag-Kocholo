        "text": "by The Cowl Editor on April 4, 2017\n\nNews\n\nThe Cowl is honored to announce that this year’s Commencement Speaker will be Providence College alum, and internationally known writer and writing coach, Roy Peter Clark ’70. Clark, who earned his BA in English from the College, was the editor of The Alembic, and the managing editor of, and writer for, The Cowl during his time here. Afterward, he attended Stony Brook University, receiving an MA in English, and then in 1974 receiving a Ph.D. in English, specializing in medieval literature.\n\nSince then, he has been a professor at Auburn University, a journalist for the St. Petersburg Times, and a writing coach for their staff. He also became the first full-time faculty member at the Poynter Institute, where he is best known for being a teacher of journalism. After 30 years of dedicated work for the Institute, Clark retired in January, but still regularly contributes pieces to Poynter.org.\n\nClark has either authored or edited a total of 18 books, and is the founding director of the National Writers Workshops. He has also been featured on NPR, Today, and the Oprah Winfrey Show. Clark was also inducted into the Features Hall of Fame, is a service member for the American Society of News Editors, and received an honorary degree from Goucher College. He will be awarded an honorary doctorate of journalism degree from PC during the 99th Commencement Exercises. Full-length story to follow.\n\n-The Editors of The Cowl"
