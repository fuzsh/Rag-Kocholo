        "text": "Oscar Gamble, who hit 200 home runs for seven clubs over 17 major league seasons, died on Jan. 31 at the age of 68 from a rare tumor on his jaw.\n\nGamble, who was born in Ramer, graduated from G.W. Carver and lived in Montgomery, was known for his fearless left-handed batting stance in which he would crouch over the plate like a question mark. His sweet swing took advantage of the short right-field porch at Yankee Stadium.\n\nHe was also known for his hairstyle, an Afro that tested batting helmets and defied gravity. His 1976 Topps baseball card — with a Yankees cap airbrushed atop his head — became the enduring image of a veteran hitter and a congenial teammate.\n\nThis poem is dedicated to his memory.\n\nWhen baseball is a game no more\n\nAnd Wrigley is in ruins,\n\nWhen white socks are just things to wear\n\nAnd anthems empty tunes,\n\nCrowd echoes will ring silent,\n\nAnd ash trees will stand bare,\n\nThe only thing remembered then\n\nWill be Oscar Gamble’s hair.\n\nIt exceeded all proportion,\n\nIt could not be contained,\n\nIt bloomed round as a dark sunrise,\n\nIt glistened in the rain.\n\nThe little boys with crew cuts\n\nOr blond locks oh so fair\n\nWould look and cheer with wonder\n\nAt Oscar Gamble’s hair.\n\nThe Big O was a handsome man\n\nWho came from Alabam.\n\nHe grew up facing Old Jim Crow\n\nAnd home runs learned to slam.\n\nHe led the race with wit and pride,\n\nHe welcomed all the stares,\n\nAnd smiled into the mirror\n\nAt Oscar Gamble’s hair.\n\nCleveland let him grow it big,\n\nWhen a helmet was applied,\n\nHe looked like Mickey Mouse’s bro,\n\nA puff ball on each side.\n\nNew York paid to tame it,\n\nHe played without despair,\n\nFor his legend kept on growing\n\nJust like Oscar Gamble’s hair.\n\nOthers sports Afros\n\nAs a sign of racial pride,\n\nFrom Angela D to Dr. J\n\nBlack halos high and wide.\n\nAnd me, I hold a baseball card\n\nWith sacramental care,\n\nThey airbrushed a New York Yankees cap\n\nOn Oscar Gamble's hair.\n\nHe passed this world near Birmingham\n\nA diamond on the square\n\nBut left behind the memories\n\nOf Oscar Gamble's hair.\n\nIf I could grow a crop like that\n\nI'd stand up as his heir\n\nAnd step up to the plate with pride\n\nAnd Oscar Gamble's hair.\n\nRoy Peter Clark began his teaching career in the English department at AUM in 1974. From there he went to the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in St. Petersburg, Florida. For 40 years he has coached writers of all ages. He is the author of 18 books, including \"Writing Tools\" and \"The Glamour of Grammar.\""
