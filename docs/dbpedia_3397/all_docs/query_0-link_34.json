With the objective of shedding light on the overlooked and sometimes missing pages of African American history, Ramsey’s writings stimulate, educate, and bring the audience closer to a truth in American history—a truth that does not always reflect a reality that is easy to view.\n\nCheryl Klein is the editorial director at Lee & Low Books.

She’s also a novelist, having authored the Vamped young adult series and the Latter-Day Olympians series, among other books. Her short fiction and essays have appeared in many anthologies, including Strip-Mauled and Dear Bully: 70 Authors Tell Their Stories. Diver “lived in Florida with her husband and daughter, the two cutest dogs in the world, and enough books to fill an entire store and perhaps some day collapse the second floor of her home into the first.”\n\nNative Floridian Craig Pittman was born in Pensacola, and he graduated from Troy State University (Alabama) where his muckraking work for the student newspaper prompted an agitated dean to label him “the most destructive force on campus.” He has since covered a variety of newspaper beats and quite a few natural disasters, including “hurricanes, wildfires, and the Florida Legislature.” As a Tampa Bay Times reporter, Pittman chronicles some of our state’s weirdest and wackiest moments, some of which went on to appear in his book Oh, Florida! How America’s Weirdest State Influences the Rest of the Country."
