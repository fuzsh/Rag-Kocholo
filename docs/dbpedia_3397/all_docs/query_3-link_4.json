        "text": "Roy Peter Clark has been called \"America's writing coach\" as his stated mission is to help create \"a nation of writers.\" Since 1977 he has taught writing to small children and to Pulitzer winning authors from his mother ship, The Poynter Institute, a school for journalism and democracy in St. Petersburg, Florida. He is the author or editor of 17 books on writing, language, and journalism. The latest, all published by Little, Brown, are \"Writing Tools,\" \"The Glamour of Grammar,\" and \"Help! for Writers,\" which is now also a mobile app. His work has been featured on the Today Show, NPR, and the Oprah Winfrey Show. More than a million of his writing podcasts have been downloaded on iTunesU. On five occasions he has served as a Pulitzer juror and twice has chaired the jury on nonfiction books. His honors include induction in the Features Hall of Fame, an honorary degree from Goucher College, and a stint at Vassar College as Starr Writer-in-Residence. His next book, due out in 2013, is \"How to Write Short: Word Craft for Fast Times.\"\n\nRead full bio"
