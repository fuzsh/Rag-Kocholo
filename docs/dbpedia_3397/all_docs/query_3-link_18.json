        "text": "Contributing Writer\n\nAs the new contributing writer for my favorite newspaper, I craft features that appear regularly in the Sunday Floridian section and online. This is a new adventure for an old writer, inspired by the journey of humankind in a troubled world. Mired in pandemic, deep recession, and political unrest, readers need an escape hatch. A little wit, whimsy, and wisdom are gold coins in the sand. I come to this after 40 years as a writing coach at Poynter, the school that owns the Times. Iâ€™ve lived in St. Pete for all those years with wife Karen and three daughters. I have written about AIDS, the Holocaust, literacy, war, but also Ray Charles, pelicans, the Lone Ranger, and Pee-wee Herman."
