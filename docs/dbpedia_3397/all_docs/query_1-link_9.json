        "text": "There is something about turning 75 that has me asking the big, big questions about life and death. Who am I really? Where did I come from? How did I get here?\n\nI am fortunate that my mother, Shirley Clark, kept a velveteen baby book, titled “Wee Me,” popular in the years after World War II when the baby boom exploded. In the book, she chronicled the circumstances of my birth and my development during the early years.\n\nShe attached some artifacts: my birth certificate, my hospital bracelet, a few photos, even a lock of my gorgeous blondish hair.\n\nThere are some things not in the book. I know that I was born the day before Easter in 1948. If I had been a girl born on St. Paddy’s Day, I would have been named Patricia. My first journey outside the womb was in a taxi that carried me across the Brooklyn Bridge to a small apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in a large complex called Knickerbocker Village.\n\nTo prompt busy moms, the book devotes each page to a topic or category, such as “My First Word.” Here’s what Shirley Clark wrote in my imagined voice:\n\nWell, to be truthful, I’ve been saying many words since the time I came home from the hospital, but, Golly! no one in the family knew what I was talking about. Now, I’m 10 months old, and I’ve gotten them to understand me when I say: Da-Da, Bye-Bye, Baby, Cookie, Ma-Ma, Pa-Pa, Bot (short for Bottle).\n\nP.S. Give me a little more time and I’ll teach this family a few thousand words! Signed, Roy\n\nA few thousand words. Hmm.\n\nMissing from all this praise, my Jewish relatives call it “kvelling,” are certain challenges with potty training, a fear of walking without someone holding my hand, and failures in my first try at school. Yes, go ahead and mock me, readers. I flunked kindergarten.\n\nToward the back are pages where mothers were invited to keep Mommy Notes in their own voices. If you want to know why I grew up to become an approval junkie, it can be traced to reflections such as these:\n\nAge 16 months — Roy is the talk of the neighborhood. He can speak more than any child his age. He can sing every other word of “See-Saw,” “Jack and Jill,” and “Four-Leaf Clover,” besides a wonderful vocabulary. Mimics everything & everybody.\n\nAge 24 months — Roy is a real boy and all my time is spent running around after him. He can recite the entire alphabet, can the read the letters A-E-F-W-M-L. Not bad, eh? Still sings all day long.\n\nMost people would be grateful for such precious anecdotes, but I must confess that I found them just a bit discouraging. On the plus side were those early markers of literacy and signs of music appreciation and performance. More than 70 years later, I still read and write something every day, and I play music and sing to friends and strangers at the drop of a baseball cap.\n\nBut yikes! Has my mom presented evidence that I was fully formed by the age of 2? Did I have no choice — in the face of nature and/or nurture — but to turn into the word-drunk, showoff, garage-band legend that I have become?\n\nSix years before my birth, my mother miscarried a male child, a devastating experience that almost influenced her not to try again. I still wonder what my life would have been like had I not been treated as the firstborn.\n\nMy brother Vincent arrived when I was 4 years old. By then my parents no longer had the energy to keep scrupulous track of Baby No. 2. There are 10 baby photos of me for every one of Vincent. His thin baby book makes mine look encyclopedic.\n\nIf we were born today, our young lives would be captured in texts, photos and videos and shared across the globe in social media. Maybe those will be saved in a cloud for the next millennium or so or until the robots judge them superfluous.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I’m grateful my mom created, in her beautiful script, the story of Wee Roy in something I can still hold in my hands.\n\nAny readers out there who still have their baby books?"
