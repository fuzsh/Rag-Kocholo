        "text": "This episode is sponsored by Scrivener, created by writers for writers.\n\nBy Brendan O’Meara\n\nIn this conversation, Roy Peter Clark, author of Murder Your Darlings: And Other Gentle Writing Advice from Aristotle to Zinsser (Little, Brown), he says, “Every story is a workshop.”\n\nWhat a great way to approach reading and writing. I love it.\n\nRoy is the author of several books on writing including Writing Tools, The Glamour of Grammar, Writing Short, Help! for Writers, and The Art of X-Ray Reading.\n\nIn this episode we talk about a deep dive he took on a 19-year-old college freshman’s brilliant story of a man washing the stain of blood from the sidewalk after a killing.\n\nThere’s lots of great stuff I know you’ll dig in this episode, so I’ll leave you to it.\n\nBe sure to keep the conversation going on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, @CNFPod.\n\nIf you dig the show, consider leaving a nice review on Apple Podcasts. I make it a point to review shows I like, so I’m not just asking for reviews and not dishing it out!\n\nAlso subscribe to my monthly newsletter to be entered in book raffles, and to receive reading recommendations, and podcast news.\n\nBy Brendan O’Meara\n\nThis week on The Creative Nonfiction Podcast decided to revisit my episode with Roy Peter Clark (@RoyPeterClark on Twitter), this time condensing that two-hour interview and pulling out the best moments.\n\nIn it we hear Roy talk about how he learned to swim in the language, the moment he learned the true meaning of literacy, and when research can become crippling.\n\nI’m experimenting with the form and making it more like a mini one-source profile. Let me know what you think. I think it makes for a better overall listen. Ping me on Twitter @BrendanOMeara with thoughts, or to say hi.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the podcast on the Apple podcast app and on Google Play Music. Leave a rating if you’re feeling extra kind. Those help.\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nBy Brendan O’Meara\n\nTweetables by Roy Peter Clark:\n\n“If I live till 90, I hope that year I’m still learning about the craft and still helping in some way.”\n\n“We’re probably going to see new things in it because our autobiography has changed.”\n\n“If you’re literate, you read in certain ways and you write in certain kinds of ways, but it’s the third element people fail to see: If you are a literate person, you have the capacity to talk about [it].”\n\n“Every piece of writing needs a focus, a central idea.”\n\n“It’s my mission to open the door for literacy and good writing wider and wider so more and more people can imagine themselves as belonging to a community of writers, a nation of writers.”\n\n“What good is freedom of expression if we lack the means to express ourselves?”\n\n“Too often, more research is an excuse for not writing.”\n\nHowdy there, CNFers, hope you’re having a CNFin good week.\n\nI snagged you a great guest this week, luck on my part and generosity on the part of Roy Peter Clark, America’s Writing Coach, scholar, and author of five books on writing in ten years: Writing Tools, The Glamour of Grammar, Help! For Writers, How to Write Short and The Art of X-Ray Reading.\n\nI’m going to repeat that: five books in ten years. I revisit them all the time to sharpen the saw. Each time I crack open, say, Writing Tools, I become better and better.\n\nIn this episode you’ll learn a lot about how Roy came to live inside the language, and how those early experiences led him, ultimately, to the Poynter Institute where he coached and influenced a nation of writers.\n\nMaybe the most important takeaway from this issue of #CNF is the amount of mentors and teachers Roy mentions throughout this episode and the influence they had on his development as a writer and teacher.\n\nI debated whether to break this up into two episodes, but decided to leave it as one whole.\n\nI do hope you’ll share this episode with others, subscribe if you haven’t already, rate it, if you haven’t already, LIKE THE FACEBOOK PAGE, subscribe to my email newsletter, etc, etc…\n\nThanks for listening, guys, now sit back and enjoy the one and only Roy Peter Clark.\n\nSome of Roy’s columns from Poynter.org:\n\nTrump on quotation marks\n\nOn William Zinsser, author of On Writing Well\n\nOn Jimmy Breslin #legend\n\nWritten by Brendan O’Meara\n\nWriting books may as well be writing procrastination books. There’s a big market in writing procrastination and writers capitalize on it. That’s the dream of every writer: to get to a point where he/she is reputable enough to write a book on writing. He/she knows there’s a new generation of saps looking to put off their writing by learning a new tip from the incumbent writer emeritus. I’m a sap that says, “No, it’s continuing education.” Which it is, but there’s no better way to become more skilled than to put the pencil to the paper.\n\nThere really is only one tip: write like it’s a job (because if you’re serious about it, it is). Or, more bluntly, write like a mofo. (How great is Cheryl Strayed?)\n\nHemingway didn’t even know he wrote a book on writing, which makes his one of the very best. It’s titled: Ernest Hemingway on Writing, Edited by Larry W. Phillips. One my faves. Tons of great nuggets from letters to friends. He had a social network where they shared tools, tricks, and insights. They helped each other.\n\nStephen King doesn’t get enough credit for being a great writer (Have you read Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption?). His book On Writing is excellent. Buy it.\n\nThe New New Journalism by Robert S. Boynton is a series of interviews with great narrative journalists. They talk about writing and reporting. I reference it all the time.\n\nRoy Peter Clark’s Writing Tools is the best of his many books on writing. If you can get ahold of his laminated Writing Tools Quick Sheet, do it. It’s like being an NFL head coach holding a laminated card like Andy Reid.\n\nGood Prose by Tracy Kidder and Richard Todd is a wonderful collaborative book between a writer/editor tandem. I reviewed it here.\n\nLastly, Creative Nonfiction by Philip Gerard lays out what it takes to do great reporting and writing to make a work of nonfiction read like great fiction.\n\nWell, that’s it. I hope these books help. Got some others? Throw them in the comments.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nBird by Bird, Anne Lamott\n\nOn Writing Well, William Zinsser\n\nGlamour of Grammar, Roy Peter Clark\n\nHow to Write Short, Roy Peter Clark\n\nHelp! for Writers, Roy Peter Clark"
