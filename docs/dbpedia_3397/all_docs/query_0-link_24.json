        "text": "“A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,” Strunk and White wrote in their seminal writing guide The Elements of Style in 1959. For the last half century, their philosophy on writing has reigned in newsrooms and classrooms nationwide. Modern sensibilities prefer minimalism to ornamentation: critics praise the muscular prose of Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver; high school teachers plead for their students to strip their sentences of superfluous words and fancy flourishes.\n\nHowever, in her warm, witty Steering the Craft: A 21st Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story, Ursula K. Le Guin revolts against the Strunk and White idea that good sentences are always short sentences. A clean, concise sentence, Guin concedes, can be impactful, especially after a string of elaborate prose. But too many short, Hemingway-esque sentences can start to sound as tiresome as the not-yet-developed thoughts of a five year old. As Guin writes,\n\n“…very short sentences, isolated or in a series, are highly effective in the right place. Prose consisting entirely of short, syntactically simple sentences is monotonous, choppy, irritating. If short-sentence prose goes on very long, whatever its content, the thump-thump beat gives it a false simplicity that soon just sounds stupid. See Spot. See Jane. See Spot bite Jane.”\n\nIf we are to seduce our readers, Guin suggests, we must become attuned to the music of language. At the word level, we must choose our words carefully and pay attention to the symphonies they create: the rhythm and cadence of single syllables, the romance of vowels, the flowy, melodious “r,” the harsh, percussive sounds of consonants like “p” and “t.” At the sentence level, we must remember one word: variety. Too many succinct sentences and our writing sounds like it belongs in a newsroom or child’s story; too many fussy, flowery sentences and our readers inevitably get lost in a maze of syntax and have trouble deciphering our meaning. Balance is key.\n\nIn his indispensable Murder Your Darlings, Roy Peter Clark complies the collected wisdom of fifty of the best writing books ranging from titans of the genre like William Zinsser and William Strunk to gentle, encouraging voices like Brenda Ueland and Anne Lamott. Murder Your Darlings is like speed dating literature’s most iconic figures: the profile of each book is brief, but immensely instructive. If you’re a professional writer, a diligent wordsmith or just a lover of language, you’ll delight in your dates with these literary legends.\n\nIn his chapter on Ursula K. Le Guin, Clark distills Steering the Craft into 4 practical writing tips:\n\n1. read your drafts out loud\n\nPay attention to the sound of your sentences and watch out for passages that have a “monotonous rhythm.”\n\n2. vary your sentence length\n\nToo many terse sentences one after another? Add a longer sentence to give your writing a more pleasing melody. Too many lengthy, meandering 20 word sentences? Introduce a brief 2 or 4 word sentence for variety. As Janet Fitch once said in “10 Rules for Writers,” switching up your sentence structure will keep your reader from going crosseyed.\n\n3. be purposeful in your repetition\n\nThe rules of the English classroom often take the inviolability of edicts. Avoid the passive voice. Never use “I.” Never end a sentence with a preposition. Despite what stuffy English teachers may have told you, you shouldn’t always avoid repetition. Often times, the most talented literary stylists use repetition to underscore a theme or reveal a message. Take Sylvia Plath’s genius first line from The Bell Jar, her harrowing classic:\n\n“It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.”\n\nAfter this first image of a pair of Jewish spies being executed in the summer of 1953, the motif of electrocution is repeated throughout the story. Why? Because Ms. Plath was an incompetent hack who was too lazy to vary her word choice? No, Plath intentionally repeats the image of electrocution to foreshadow the novel’s disturbing climax, the protagonist Esther’s botched electro-shock treatment. Bad repetition is a result of oversight or sloppiness. Good repetition serves a purpose.\n\nWhen a reporter asked the late great Joan Didion why she repeats certain words and phrases, she replied, “I do it to remind the reader to make certain connections. Technically it’s almost a chant. You could read it as an attempt to cast a spell.”\n\nSo be a sorcerer of sentences. Feel free to repeat…so long as you’re harnessing the incantatory power of language.\n\n4. become a master of close reading\n\nClark recommends close reading one of your own passages that you think works well. Like Joan Didion who counted the words in Hemingway’s famous opening to Farewell to Arms, you should take a mathematical approach to your analysis: count, literally count, the words in each of your sentences. What do you notice? Most likely, you’ll see that you use a variety of sentences: simple, compound, complex. Some of your sentences will be as condensed as a hurried p.s. at the end of a note; others will seem as epically enormous as a Donna Tartt novel. Next time you go to write, use your passage as a model.\n\nIn the lavish prose that is her signature, Francine Du Plessix Gray defines seduction as a kind of “challenge to create a tension between the promise of gratification and the refined delay of that gratification—to intimate how much information I shall offer and how much I shall withhold.” No writer was a better master of seduction than Ernest Hemingway, whose economical writing style revolutionized English prose. A revolt against the ornate artistic flourishes of the 19th century, Hemingway’s minimalist style pioneered a fiction “in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—was stated explicitly.” His philosophy— known as the “iceberg theory”— rested on the belief that a story’s deeper meaning should be intimated— not expressed directly. In much the same way the majority of an iceberg lies beneath the water where we can’t see, most of a story— he argued— operates underneath what a text says unambiguously.\n\nOne of my favorite professors described it this way: all novels have two levels, a narrative and a story. The narrative is the surface: character, dialogue, setting. Most readers can decipher at this level of what is literally being divulged on the page. What isn’t being disclosed, however, is harder to grasp but infinitely more interesting: is what a character says what she actually means? why does she pause dramatically before she speaks? when her lover asks if she’s okay, why does she look away? In Hemingway, these uncertainties are pregnant with possibility: you have to dig beneath the narrative to get to the real story. Much like a painting’s white space heightens its colors or a symphony’s silences make its notes more resonant and full-bodied, what’s implied escalates tension and compels us to keep reading.\n\nIt is well known among writers that drama dwells in the unuttered. No where does the unsaid drive drama more than in the opening line of Hemingway’s masterpiece A Farewell to Arms:\n\n“In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.”\n\nAs a lover of poetic prose who prefers the complex constructions of a Faulkner or the opulent language of a Fitzgerald to the unornamented word choice of a Hemingway, I initially dismissed this passage as further proof that Papa was overrated. Where was the beautiful, baroque wording? the cultivated vocabulary? the sumptuous figures of speech? Hemingway’s plain diction— his monosyllabic, elementary school words, his exasperating obsession with “and” and “the”— seemed the hallmark of a less skilled writer— that is, until I read Joan Didion’s exceptional New Yorker essay, “Last Words: Those Hemingway Wrote, and Those He Didn’t.” Her penetrative close reading of A Farewell to Arm’s opening line finally made me appreciate the genius of Hemingway’s storytelling:\n\n“That paragraph, which was published in 1929, bears examination: four deceptively simple sentences, one hundred and twenty-six words, the arrangement of which remains as mysterious and thrilling to me now as it did when I first read them, at twelve or thirteen, and imagined that if I studied them closely enough and practiced hard enough I might one day arrange one hundred and twenty-six such words myself. Only one of the words has three syllables. Twenty-two have two. The other hundred and three have one. Twenty-four of the words are “the,” fifteen are “and.” There are four commas. The liturgical cadence of the paragraph derives in part from the placement of the commas (their presence in the second and fourth sentences, their absence in the first and third), but also from that repetition of “the” and of “and,” creating a rhythm so pronounced that the omission of “the” before the word “leaves” in the fourth sentence (“and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling”) casts exactly what it was meant to cast, a chill, a premonition, a foreshadowing of the story to come, the awareness that the author has already shifted his attention from late summer to a darker season. The power of the paragraph, offering as it does the illusion but not the fact of specificity, derives precisely from this kind of deliberate omission, from the tension of withheld information. In the late summer of what year? What river, what mountains, what troops?”\n\nNever in that first line does Hemingway explicitly state the year, never does he make clear that the “troops” to which he refers are fighting in WWI, the war to end all wars. Though we’re often taught that specificity is at the heart of good writing, a masterful storyteller knows sometimes its more compelling to leave things incomplete. Certainly, there are times when precision in phrasing is absolutely necessary— in an instruction manual, say, or any legal document where you sign your name— but stories exist in the ambiguities.\n\nIn his brilliant book The Art of X-Ray Reading: How the Secrets of 25 Great Works of Literature Will Improve Your Writing— the same compendium of writing wisdom that gave us Hersey on the impact of understatement and Plath on the unifying power of motif— journalist and Poynter Institute senior scholar Roy Peter Clark maintains a story is an enigma: what compels an audience to turn the page (or binge-watch another episode) is a mystery. As quintessential lady’s man Casanova once said, “love is three quarters curiosity.” If we want to seduce our audience, then, we have to conceal more than we disclose:\n\nWriting Lesson #1\n\n“As important as what you put in is what to leave out. This is easy to say but hard to do. After you’ve written a draft, read it aloud, but only to yourself. If you read it to someone else, that person may ask questions, which will lead to a longer draft. That can make things clearer. But if your goal is spare prose, it helps to listen for the useless or distracting word or phrase. It may look right on the page. But when you hear it, it may sound like that extra note in a trumpet solo.”\n\nAs a non-conformist who always had the obnoxious need to rebel against prevailing taste, it was natural for me to despise Hemingway: he was the leader of the Lost Generation, the man who single-handedly invented the style of the modern age— in other words, yet another over-hyped dead white man, a representation of the establishment I hate. This was a controversial opinion in most university classrooms, filled as they were with devoted Papa admirers. But no matter how unpopular, I’d defend my case against the man of machismo: his lean, muscular writing— I insisted— wasn’t innovative nor was his simple style the conscious choice of an artist so much as the heedlessness of an amateur lacking skill. He couldn’t choose words with the careful ear for their connotative meanings like Plath; he couldn’t string together evocative sentences like his friend/rival Fitzgerald.\n\nNot only did I despise the sparseness of his prose— I hated his incessant repetition of the same words. Jesus H. Christ, Hemingway! Is it really necessary to repeat the word “leaves” four times in a short passage of one hundred and twenty six words? Did you never learn how to vary your word choice? But just as I came to appreciate Hemingway’s austere story-telling, I eventually recognized the artistry of his repetition. His continual repeating of “leaves” wasn’t a sloppy oversight: it was an intentional choice.\n\nBut why return to the word four times?\n\nIn literature, “leaves” are archetypal symbols for maturity that signify approaching death and decay. According to Clark, Hemingway repeats this word to underscore how war annihilates all, one of A Farewell to Arms’s paramount themes:\n\n“When something is over designed, we often criticize it as being too busy or cluttered. The same is true of the arts. First it was Miles Davis and then Tony Bennet who preached the virtues of knowing which musical notes to leave out. Didion is so tuned into Hemingway that she can see the small deletions, which can create a big effect. It is not obvious why the deletion of the before leaves makes such a big difference, but it does. Perhaps the effect upon the reader comes from the establishment of a pattern followed by a variation of the norm. Notice that the word leaves appears four times in the passage, in three cases preceded by the article the. In the third example, the disappears, only to be restored in the last two words. The author sends out lots of signals that leaves is important, including repeating it four times, then letting it stick out at the end of the paragraph, abutted to the white space.\n\nSo what is the difference between “the leaves” and “leaves”? Perhaps it is the difference between specificity and generality. Between things that are contained within a space or moment and those that suddenly appear. The defines certain leaves that are covered with dust and fallen. Without it, I get a greater sense of chaos— once living things scattered to decay.\n\nSometimes in stories, leaves are not just leaves. Falling leaves are a convenient and ancient emblem for the loss of life and the change of seasons. They may be dropping from the trees between summer and winter. But remember that the dust of the roads coats the leaves, acting, perhaps, as a kind of environmental defoliant. And where does that dust come from? From troop movements. Why are the troops there? To wage war. And what does the war do? It tramples everything, kills everything. So maybe the dust is not just dust at all. Maybe it’s an iconic symbol of mortality. Dust to dust.”\n\n“Vary your words” is a dictum proclaimed in classrooms everywhere. Since we first put pen to page, we— being dedicated students— obeyed this decree, conscientiously perusing the thesaurus and straining to find a synonym so we wouldn’t repeat the same thing. “No, we couldn’t possibly use a word twice!” we thought, dreading the stern, too-serious ink of our English teachers. So instead of repeat the word “argue,” we used the sophisticated “assert” or the official-sounding “declare.” Though we’ve been taught that repetition is a sign of an inferior writer, Clark suggests it’s an indispensable addition to any wordsmith’s toolbox. As writers, we can repeat to emphasize, to highlight, to underline, to underscore. Just as Hemingway restates the word “leaves” to call attention to the devastating effects of war, we can reiterate a symbol or image to reinforce the underlying message of our work:\n\nWriting Lesson #2\n\n“Repetition is different from redundancy. Don’t strain yourself looking for synonyms. I’ll point this lesson out several times in the book. Think of repetition as a drum beat. Somehow, a marching drummer can repeat a rhythm countless times without making it sound tedious. After a while, the rhythm becomes unnoticeable, almost like a heartbeat. But it must be done with a purpose. Beware of those times when you unintentionally repeat a word or image. Readers will judge you as inattentive.”\n\n“The battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man,” Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn once wrote. Nowhere do we witness this eternal struggle more movingly than in Hiroshima, John Hersey’s unforgettable account of that fateful day on August 6th, 1945 when the atomic bomb was dropped. Hailed as the “most celebrated piece of journalism to come out of WWII,” Hiroshima follows six survivors as they navigate the devastating aftermath of nuclear war. Obliterating 100,000 lives in an infernal blast that will reverberate through the centuries as human history’s “most unspeakable crime,” the atom bomb is an unsettling reminder that the human heart is neither wholly good nor evil.\n\nHiroshima stands as a masterpiece of reporting for its ability to humanize the Japanese people at a time when words were weaponized as instruments of war. Rather than reduce them to a one-dimensional demonized “enemy,” Hersey revealed Dr. Masakazu Fujii, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, Father Wilhem Kliensorge, Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, Toshiko Sasaki, and Hatsuyo Nakamura as ordinary people: people who were staring out windows and sitting at their desks just as they had hundreds of times when their lives were forever shattered by an unprecedented act of war.\n\nWhile some reporters marveled at man’s ability to harness the cataclysmic power of atomic energy (New York Times staff member William Laurence, the only journalist to witness the terrible technology first hand, wrote with wonder, “It was no longer smoke, or dust, or even a cloud of fire. It was a living thing, a new species of being, born right before our incredulous eyes.”), others focused on calculating the staggering number of lives lost or capturing the wasteland left behind (New York Herald Tribune’s Homer Bigart observed when he visited Hiroshima in September 1945 that “across the river there was only flat, appalling desolation, the starkness accentuated by bare, blackened tree trunks and the occasional shell of a reinforced concrete building.”)\n\nHersey took a different approach. Hiroshima, originally published as a 30,000 word feature in the August 1946 issue of the New Yorker, is now considered a landmark of new journalism, a style of reporting that blended the impartial facts of traditional journalism with the pacing and storytelling of a novel. By funneling the harrowing events of that historic day through the soul-expanding subjectivity of stories instead of the heartless objectivity of mere numbers, Hersey was able to demolish the barricade between ally and enemy so often erected by war. The result is a compassionate document that— as one critic put it— “stirs the conscience” of the soul.\n\nHiroshima’s first line is perhaps one of journalism’s best-known:\n\n“At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk.”\n\nIn his instructive new book The Art of X-Ray Reading: How the Secrets of 25 Great Works of Literature Will Improve Your Writing, journalist and Poynter Institute senior scholar Roy Peter Clark seeks to break down this stellar first sentence so we can better understand how it works. A curator of spellbinding sentences and lover of lively prose, Clark contends the secret to writing well is hidden in literature’s masterworks or— as Matthew Arnold might say— in “the best that’s been thought and said” in the world. If we want to be compelling writers, we just have to crack the code. “Cracking the code” means paying attention to how an author mesmerizes us with his words. Like Hemingway, does he seduce us to turn the page by revealing less information than he withholds? Or like Plath, does he create a sense of unity by repeating an overarching motif or symbol? In much the same way authors of that endlessly edifying guide to close-reading How to Read a Book revere books as absent teachers, Clark believes literature has a wealth of writing wisdom to offer.\n\nSo how, Clark wonders, does Hersey manage to captivate us from Hiroshima’s very first line?\n\nThe sentence itself is rather simple: 63 words, 32 of which are only 1-syllable. There is no flamboyant expression, no elaborate sentence structure, no theatrical melodrama. Even the subject matter is mundane: other than the offhand reference to the bomb “flashing above Hiroshima,” the sentence focuses on the ordinary and everyday, particularly one Miss Toshiko Sasaki, who’s doing the most uninteresting thing you could possibly conceive: turning her head to chat with a co-worker. So why is this one of the most riveting first lines in all of literature? For Clark, the secret is pacing:\n\n“This feels like a most unconventional way to begin a story. In spite of the importance of time to the telling of all narratives, we rarely see this degree of temporal specificity in a first line. The word exactly is not a modifier but an intensifier. We then learn the minutes, the hour ante meridiem, the month, day, year, and time zone. That’s seven discrete time metrics before a verb. The rhetorical effect of such specificity is that of a historical marker. Something world-changing is about to happen (a meteor struck the earth; a volcano exploded; a jet plane flew into the Pentagon). Chaucer’s springtime at the beginning of The Canterbury Tales is generic and cyclical. In Hiroshima we are about to meet a group of pilgrims who share an experience that is triggered at a specific moment in time.\n\nIn a way, time is also about to stand still. Clocks and watches, damaged by the atomic blast, stopped at the moment of destruction. This symbol of the stopped watch in relation to Hiroshima is repeated as late as 2014 in the updated version of the movie Godzilla. The original was made in Japan in 1954 and is widely recognized as a science-fiction, monster-movie allegory of the consequences of nuclear destruction. In the updated version, Japanese actor Ken Watanabe carries around the talisman of a pocket watch owned by his grandfather, killed at Hiroshima. The time is frozen at eight fifteen.”\n\nAs writers, what can we take away from this unforgettable first sentence? Just as Hersey uses temporal specificity to stop time and signal that something history-making is about to happen, we can decelerate— or “freeze frame”— our narrative to amplify drama and build suspense:\n\nWriting Lesson #1\n\n“Stories are about time in motion. But there are moments when time seems to stop, at least in narrative terms: when the atom bomb drops, when Kennedy is shot, when the Challenger explodes. As a writer, you can mark that moment when time stands still. Freeze a movie into a still frame.”\n\nHiroshima is not only a paragon of pacing— it’s a matchless example of understatement. “If ever there was a subject calculated to make a writer overwrought and a piece overwritten, it was the bombing of Hiroshima,” observed New Yorker journalist and political commentator Hendrik Hertzberg. When a story is as momentous as Pearl Harbor or September 11th, it seems made for the newspapers. There’s conflict, there’s catastrophe, there’s lives lost. But though it’s tempting to hyperbolize, a good writer will restrain himself. What makes Hiroshima so powerful is the way Hersey lets the material speak for itself. Instead of indulging in melodrama— say, by sensationalizing the carnage or heavy-handedly accentuating the scene’s pathos— Hersey writes in a matter-of-fact style, employing only plain words all the while maintaining a dispassionate, journalistic tone. As Clark explains, when a story is “big,” the key is to write “small”:\n\n“In bringing us finally to the main part of the sentence, the author puts into practice two reliable rhetorical strategies, one from ancient Greece, the other from the American newsroom. The name for the first is litotes, or understatement- the opposite of hyperbole. While an unwise writer might overwhelm us with the visceral imagery of destruction, Hersey chooses to introduce a most common scene of daily life: one office worker turning to another, allowing the drama to unfold. In the face of astonishing content, step back a bit. Don’t call undue attention to the tricks of the writer.\n\nA related strategy comes from an old bit of newsroom wisdom: “The bigger the smaller.” Nowhere was this strategy used more than in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11th. Faced with almost apocalyptic physical destruction and the loss of nearly three thousand lives, writers such as Jim Dwyer of the New York Times looked for ways to tell a story that seemed from its inception “too big.” Dwyer chose to highlight physical objects with stories hiding inside of them: a window washer’s squeegee used to help a group break out of a stalled elevator in one of the Twin Towers; a family photo discovered in the rubble; a paper cup used by an escaping stranger to give water to another.\n\nThe author of Hiroshima offers readers something akin to writing teacher Robert McKee’s “inciting incident.” This is the moment that kicks off the energy of the story, the instant when normal life is transformed into story life. All the characters described in the first paragraph are experiencing a version of normal, everyday life- given the context of an ongoing world war- but whatever their expectations, they were changed forever at the exact moment the atomic bomb flashed over Hiroshima.”\n\nWriting Lesson #2\n\n“Given the exact nature of the news and the death toll, the author’s narrative feels somehow underwritten, in a good way. There are no elaborate metaphors. The author keeps the focus on the cast of characters and not on his own feelings or emotions. In general, this is a good rhetorical strategy. The more powerful or consequential the content, the more the author should “get out of the way.” This does not mean that craft must be set aside. Instead, it means craft must be used to create a feeling of understatement.”\n\nThe benefits of reading are manifold. For Ralph Waldo Emerson, what’s wonderful about books is that “a company of the wisest and the most deserving people from all the civilized countries of the world, for thousands of years can make the results of their studies and their wisdom available to us” whereas for Honore de Balzac, reading acquaints us with “unknown friends.” Research suggests reading not only magnifies our capacity for empathy and strengthens our ability to be open-minded, it promotes the kind of free-thinking on which democracy depends.\n\nAs writers, reading has the added benefit of helping us improve our craft. Much like a blacksmith learns to mold metals by studying under an apprentice, a writer learns the elements of composition by dissecting (and imitating) her favorite penmen. Writing is a kind of magic: it takes instruction under the tutelage of a master to become an enchantress of the craft.\n\nThe belief that we can become better writers by becoming better readers is at the heart of journalist and Poynter Institute senior scholar Roy Peter Clark’s new book The Art of X-Ray Reading: How the Secrets of 25 Great Works of Literature Will Improve Your Writing. A wonderful companion to his altogether indispensable Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer, The Art of X-Ray Reading surveys some of the most celebrated works in all of English letters, distilling their insights into practical lessons writers— both novice and expert— can apply to their craft.\n\nIf we want to write with the lyrical beauty of a Fitzgerald or with an appreciation of the short sentence like Melville, Clark argues we must read actively with “x-ray glasses” close at hand. Written with a profound reverence for story-telling and an obvious love of literature, The Art of X-Ray Reading will teach you to dissemble a text so you can better understand how it works. Though as a bookish English major I’ve read most of the texts Clark examines, I closed The Art of X-Ray Reading with a newfound appreciation for many of those tattered treasures we call the “canon.” From analyzing how Hemingway intentionally omits information to build suspense to anatomizing how Hersey harnesses the power of understatement to emphasize the drama of that fateful morning on August 6th, Clark helps us peek behind the curtain on literature’s finest sentences, revealing good writing is the product of deliberate workmanship— not of chance:\n\n“Where do writers learn their best moves? They learn from a technique I call X-ray reading. They read for information or vicarious experience or pleasure, as we all do. But in their reading, they see something more. It’s as if they had a third eye or a pair of X-ray glasses like the ones advertised years ago in comic books.\n\nThis special vision allows them to see beneath the surface of the text. There they observe the machinery of making meaning, invisible to the rest of us. Through a form of reverse engineering…they see the moving parts, the strategies that create the effects we experience from the page— effects such as clarity, suspense, humor, epiphany, and pain. These working parts are then stored in the writer’s toolshed in boxes with names such as grammar, syntax, punctuation, spelling, semantics, etymology, poetics, and that big box— rhetoric.”\n\nIn Chapter 5 “Jolt of Insight,” Clark close reads Sylvia Plath’s first and only novel, The Bell Jar. The story follows Esther Greenwood, an ambitious young writer who earns a coveted internship at a prestigious New York magazine as a guest editor. Though she knows her dazzling life of big city glamor and patent leather would be the envy of most girls, Esther becomes more and more disenchanted as the novel goes on. When she returns home to Massachusetts to find she hasn’t been accepted to a distinguished summer writing program, she sinks into a debilitating depression. An incisive and deeply disturbing account of mental illness, The Bell Jar is one of my favorite novels not only for its historical-cultural significance (never before had a book so frankly discussed such topics as the tension between career and child-bearing or the taboo subject of a woman’s desire for sex), but for the unrivaled genius of its prose. The Bell Jar’s first line makes evident Plath’s literary virtuoso:\n\nIt was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.\n\nWith a linguist’s ear for the subtle effects of sound and a critic’s eye for socio-cultural references, Clark deconstructs this masterpiece of a first sentence:\n\n“Before I read another word, I felt the need to X-ray that sentence. At twenty-three words, it is a short and memorable first sentence for a novel, beginning with a subject and verb of the main clause, always an encouraging sign.\n\n“It was a queer, sultry summer…”\n\nI feel a tension between the adjectives queer and sultry. The first carries a judgement of distortion, something not quite right in the air. The second, sultry, has the sense of something physical, hot and humid, but not necessarily unpleasant, perhaps carrying a sexual connotation, like the sound of a tenor sax. (I’ve always felt that individual letters can carry hidden meanings. It may seem strange to say, but the letter u makes me uneasy, especially that triple dose of it in the phrase “queer, sultry summer.”)\n\nWhat comes next is a shocking intrusion: “the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs…”\n\nA lot of things happened during the summer of 1953, when the story takes place: the Korea War ended, JFK and Jackie were married in Newport, Rhode Island; television was coming into its own. An obsession with a New York Jewish couple executed for espionage aligns with queer and connects the collective paranoia of the McCarthy era with our protagonist’s distorted view of reality.\n\n[…]\n\nThe whole sentence moves with remarkable efficiency from a season to an era to the confusion of a single young woman.”\n\nSo what can writers learn from this remarkable first line? If you want to entice your readers to keep reading, Clark recommends adding an element of shock or surprise:\n\nWriting Lesson #1\n\n“Many examples of good writing have a one-two-three quality to them: subject, verb, object. In most cases, you don’t want the reader to stop or even pause. My mentor Don Fry calls this effect the “steady advance.” But there will be exceptions, moments when the writer will intrude on the reader’s expectations, even in the middle of a sentence. Call it a bump in the road. Plath achieves this effect with the insertion of the Rosenberg execution inside her first sentence. What if the sentence had been: “It was a queer, sultry summer, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” Clear and compelling enough, but not brilliant and explosive. Most sentences you write will be A-B-C. If you want to catch the reader off guard, consider A-X-B.”\n\nAs readers, it’s often easier to understand “what” an author is saying than to decipher “how” it is she produces certain effects. “It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” What is being said is clear enough but how it manages to linger in our memory— that’s more of a mystery. Clark further demystifies the spell of this stellar sentence by unveiling the “how” behind its effectiveness. Plath’s opening line is brilliant largely in part because it establishes the novel’s central motif of electrocution from the very first sentence:\n\n“If something is important enough to place in the first sentence of a novel, even as a seeming aside, is it important enough to revisit? We saw in Gatsby how the author introduced the green light on Daisy’s dock in the first chapter, how he reintroduced that light in the middle of the novel, and how he brought it back, with dozens of suggestive thematic implications, at the end. We come to expect that type of exquisite story architecture from our favorite literary artists.\n\nSo beyond my personal curiosity about the Rosenbergs, should I expect them to return to the stage later in Plath’s novel? Here is what follows that first sentence:\n\nI’m stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that’s all there was to read about in the papers- google-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn’t help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.\n\nI thought it must be the worst thing in the world.\n\n“It has nothing to do with me.” Yeah, right. It has everything to do with our protagonist, Esther Greenwood, a fill-in for Plath in this highly autobiographical novel, who, during an internship at a fashion magazine in New York City, is traumatized time and again.\n\nSure enough, the Rosenbergs reappear on page 100 of my edition, the beginning of chapter 9. Esther is speaking with another young woman at the fashion magazine about the imminent execution of Esther and Julius:\n\nSo I said, “Isn’t it awful about the Rosenbergs?”\n\nThe Rosenbergs were to be electrocuted late that night.\n\n“Yes!” Hilda said, and at last I felt I had touched a human string in the cat’s cradle of her heart. It was only as the two of us waited for the others in the tomblike morning gloom of the conference room that Hilda amplified that Yes of hers.\n\n“It’s awful that such people should be alive…I’m so glad that they’re going to die.”\n\nThis dispiriting moment comes just before the crisis that will crush our protagonist at the end of the first half of the book, when a blind date turns into a muddy rape attempt that leaves her physically injured and emotionally devastated, so much so that she returns to her hotel and throws all her glamorous clothes she has accumulated off the top of the skyscraper.\n\nPiece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly, like a loved one’s ashes, the gray scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York.\n\nIn that dark moment, Plath offers a kind of silent convergence of the public and private. Almost at the exact time the Rosenbergs would be electrocuted, the main character undergoes a kind of symbolic death, her clothes being scatted to the winds, “like a loved one’s ashes.”\n\nThe sign of a true artist is her every choice is intentional. Though the reference to the Rosenbergs in the first line seems like a passing comment, Clark realizes it has a much greater significance to The Bell Jar as a whole. Like the Jewish spies executed during that “queer, sultry” summer, Esther will be electrocuted in a botched electro-shock treatment after suffering a mental breakdown. Foreshadowed in that first trifling twenty-three word sentence is the most tragic, climatic moment of the novel:\n\n“It was only after I had closed the book that I was stunned by the beauty of what Plath had created. It was like looking at daybreak pouring through the rose window of a cathedral. All that business about the Rosenbergs— the constant references not to their execution but to their electrocution— turned out to be a prologue to the traumatic events in Esther’s life, including a medical procedure in a facility that looks and works like a prison in which she is pinned down and wired up (like the Rosenbergs, no doubt) and shot up with electricity. It is, at least at first, her version of the death penalty.”\n\nWhat makes The Bell Jar such a masterful work is how it’s so architecturally sound. One of the greatest literary geniuses of our time, Plath establishes the novel’s principal motif in the very first line, the Rosenbergs’ brutal execution by electric chair a harbinger of Esther’s barbaric treatment by electroshock. If stories are man’s way of making sense of the world, a good story imposes order onto the messy material of real life’s chaos. Unlike in life, in a story, each event has meaning; every interaction, every exchange, a role: to reveal character, to establish theme or tone. Every single line operates to form a coherent narrative arc. But in the hands of a less adept storyteller, a novel will seem the product neither of logic nor thought: incidents, both pressing and trivial, will be included at random with no regard as to whether they have a purpose like advance the plot, an object will seem symbolically significant but only be mentioned once. An expert storyteller, on the other hand, hypnotizes us by giving the impression that every element of the narrative performs an essential part: a dramatic change in weather reflects a shift in mood, the repetition of an object will be shown to have meaning later on.\n\nThe Bell Jar stands as a harrowing beauty of an American classic largely because Plath’s storytelling is all method and no madness. Though she traces one woman’s terrifying descent into insanity, she writes with a control that is rational and painstaking. It is proof of her artistry that she is able to hint at the plot’s highest point from the first few words. Clark suggests incorporating a unifying theme, image, or motif into our work to make it similarly cohere:\n\nWriting Lesson #2\n\n“Not all allusions are created equal. When an author quotes another author or mentions historical figures (such as the Rosenbergs), he or she embeds one narrative within another. As we’ve seen with the opening of The Bell Jar, an apparent offhand comment becomes a much grander metaphor, taking on new contexts and connotations as the narrative builds up steam. Most coherent texts contain a dominant image— sometimes more than one— that links the parts and accelerates the action.”"
