        "text": "My old friend and mentor Roy Peter Clark has written a call to action – or inaction, really – about how we define plagiarism and how we react to activities we confuse with it.\n\nThis is an issue I’ve worried about for some time, and I think Roy’s piece is valuable and long overdue. The digital world has made it far easier to compare passages, and I think that’s made us hypersensitive about plagiarism. Which does nobody any good, and risks further damaging young journalists and newsrooms that are already under stress.\n\nTo be clear, plagiarism is a grievous journalistic sin, and worthy of a shoot-to-kill order. But not all forms of reuse are plagiarism, and that’s the distinction that I fear is being lost today.\n\nHere are some examples of reuse that Roy covers, and that I agree shouldn’t trigger accusations of plagiarism:\n\n* revisiting one’s own ideas\n\n* inserting in-house boilerplate\n\n* filling out a story with material from the AP or a press release\n\nNone of these things are the kind of journalism that make judges coo and readers swoon. All of them should be governed by best practices. (If your newsroom is lacking such guidance, this one simple rule might save you: Never surprise your editor.) As Roy himself notes, “[m]y decriminalizing these activities does not mean that I approve of them. It means I can consider them, act on them, even criticize them in a different frame than the stigmatizing one that the word plagiarism requires. I can use a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.”\n\nThese things – particularly the latter two – are daily, meat-and-potatoes stuff in countless newsrooms, practices that save time and effort for bigger things. We shouldn’t be proud of them, and we should draw lines for what is and isn’t acceptable. But it’s ridiculous to put them in the same category with theft of other writers’ sentences or arguments in a bid to deceive.\n\nThat’s real plagiarism – a felony where the other issues are misdemeanors at worst. Roy’s piece is brave and wise, and I hope it gets read and debated and taken to heart."
