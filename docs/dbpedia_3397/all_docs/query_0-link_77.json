        "text": "How happy are you with your writing voice?\n\nWhen I interview writers for Chip’s Writing Lessons, they often bring up the subject of voice.\n\n“A story, reported deeply and written with an authentic writer’s voice, has the power to move readers.”\n\n-DeNeen L. Brown\n\n“Even if I am the narrator, or the lead storyteller, every character has a story, every person in the room has a voice.”\n\n-Valerie Boyd\n\n“I think you can apply this to any artistic endeavor, not just writing. It’s a quote from the jazz pianist Thelonious Monk : ‘“A genius is the one most like himself.”\n\nNot saying I’m a genius or anything, but this struck me as important when I read it, and to me it says something important about voice and integrity, and how that translates onto the page.”\n\n-Sean Tanner\n\n“If I began a short story or worked on a novel in the evening at home I drifted into trance states and couldn’t push through, couldn’t continue and finish. I had writer’s block before I became a writer. Nor was the quality of what I was writing even close to what I wanted it to be. I wrote Joycean or Faulknerian pastiches; when I tried to write in my own voice I overworked my sentences to the point of affectation. I was three hands clapping. I was too tight.’”\n\n-Richard Rhodes\n\nVoice deeply interests my friend Anne Janzer, a prolific author of several excellent books on writing (“Writing to Be Understood;” “The Writer’s Process,” “Get the Word Out” and “33 Ways Not To Screw Up Your Business Emails.”)\n\nAnne writes about the science and mystery of writing. Right now, she’s conducting research into that elusive idea of writing voice—including how easily we can shift it and how we feel about it.\n\nHelp her explore the topic by answering this short, six-question survey.\n\nYour responses will be private, and she’ll share the responses when the survey is done.\n\nTaking this survey got me thinking about my own writing voice. It should be fascinating to see how a larger community of writers responds.\n\nLink to survey: https://forms.gle/wVj8it3vwq2FAMZe9\n\nThanks.\n\nMy new book, “33 Ways Not To Screw Up Your Journalism,” is now available on Amazon from Networlding Publishing.\n\nTo get it in the hands of as many readers as possible, the Kindle version is at no charge today and tomorrow.\n\nFor the following three days, it will cost 99 cents. After that, it returns to the regular $4.99 price. The paperback is $12.99.\n\nIt’s a succinct, authoritative handbook that delivers 33 essential tools, techniques and values at a time when democracy needs principled, quality journalism more than ever.\n\n33 Ways is a survival manual for journalists and students, regardless of age, job, or level of experience, and their teachers.\n\nPlease feel free to share the link— https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Not-Screw-Your…/dp/B0B3QY3K64/\n\n— with your family, friends, students, aspiring journos and colleagues.\n\n“Chip Scanlan has all the journalism tools at his disposal–including a screwdriver. Grab it!”\n\n– Roy Peter Clark, “Writing Tools,” The Poynter Institute.\n\nYour opinion counts, too. Love it or not, leave a review on Amazon, please.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nChip\n\nPS. Apologies for the earlier mixup. The free book was supposed to be available yesterday, but for a scheduling mixup on Amazon. Here’s a screenshot showing the free price now.\n\nBecause you’re a subscriber to Chip’s Writing Lessons, I wanted to give you advance notice that on Thursday, June 16, the ebook edition of my new book, 33 Ways Not To Screw Up Your Journalism, will be free for the first two days of publication.\n\nFor the following three days, the price will be 99 cents. Then it returns to the regular sales price of $4.99, which is what it costs to pre-order before Thursday. (The paperback is $12.99.)\n\nI’m doing this to get it quickly in the hands of as many readers as I can. I believe this succinct, authoritative handbook is a survival manual that’s needed by journalists and students, whatever their age, job, or level of experience, now more than ever in our democracy.\n\nPlease feel free to share the link— amzn.to/3zq5IDM — with your friends and colleagues.\n\nYour opinion counts. Love or hate it, leave a review on Amazon, please.\n\nMany thanks. Chip\n\nPersonal/Professional News: I’ve got a new book coming out, “33 Ways Not To Screw Up Your Journalism,” as soon as next month. As I prepare for the launch, I’m trying to build up my list of followers and influencers who would be willing to help me promote it.\n\nTo attract them, I’m offering two things:\n\n1. a free PDF copy of my most recent book, “Writers on Writing,” a collection of interviews with leading journalists and nonfiction authors with a smattering of fiction writers and poets\n\n.2. A sample chapter from the new book.\n\nIn exchange, all I’d like you to do is follow me on Twitter @chipscanlan, and retweet this message. If you’re interested in writing tips from the likes of @susanorlean, @DanBarryNYT, @LaneDeGregory, @JohnBranchNYT @BronwenDickey @bmarimow65 @thallmanjr\n\nand are interested in this offer, just email me at chipscan@gmail.com with the subject line “33 Ways”\n\nI hope my friends @StevePadilla2 @RoyPeterClark @KimhCross @Karen_E_Bender @IUMediaScotProf @janwinburnCNN & my other followers will also spread the word with a retweet\n\nThis is the reality of book publishing today. Even with a publisher–mine is @networlding, a boutique firm for indie authors–the author must shoulder the burden of marketing, a lesson I learned from @AnneJanzer Many thanks and I hope you can join my “buzz team.” Chip\n\nMention the word data and many journalists look like a deer caught in the headlights. We’re word people, we say. Data is for geeks.\n\nThat attitude denies your audience information in computer databases that reveal hidden secrets and compelling stories. It can cheat you of the chance to do the most exciting and important work in your career.\n\n“Data journalism matters because we live, increasingly, in a data-driven world,” Casey Frechette, who teaches and researches data journalism at the University of South Florida’s St. Petersburg campus, told me. “The digitization of society means the emergence of limitless troves of information about how businesses operate; how citizens lead their lives; how governments run. In this sea of data, it’s easy to find ourselves adrift. Data journalists help us make sense of it all.”\n\nSTEP INTO DATA JOURNALISM\n\nAcquire. The Washington Post used newly released tract level census data for an interactive database that shows, by typing in your address, how the racial makeup of your neighborhood has changed since 1990.\n\nQuery. The data journalist probes the stockpile of information, looking for story ideas in spreadsheets or to confirm key facts from traditional sources, like an interview with a public official.\n\nAnalyze. Using basic math and at times advanced statistics, data journalists find averages, establish ratios and crunch percentages. Sophisticated calculations can establish correlations between two variables, such as tenant evictions and rising rents.\n\nVisualize. “It’s vital.” Frechette says, “to enable people to understand what data means. That’s where visualization comes in, turning statistics into interactive maps and visual worlds.”\n\nWall Street Journal reporters Joel Eastwood and Erik Hinton achieved that with an algorithm to compile lyrics from the Broadway musical hit Hamilton that enabled them to show how Lin-Manuel Miranda tapped rap and hip hop’s imperfect, internal rhymes to make musical history. It’s very cool.\n\nHUMANIZING DATA\n\nBehind every statistic is a human being. Data journalists who don’t find them fail to connect their findings with their audiences.\n\nNumbers numb, according to psychologist Paul Slovic, who co-authored a 2015 study “The More Who Die, the Less We Care.” It concluded that “as numbers get larger and larger, we become insensitive; numbers fail to trigger the emotion or feeling necessary to motivate action.”\n\nAbout 700 women die in America every year from pregnancy or delivery complications, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, making it the nation with the highest level of maternal mortality in the developed world.\n\nBut how to illustrate the problem when most of these deaths are kept hidden by authorities?\n\nProPublica and NPR reporters solved it by creating their own dataset of victims by scouring public posts on Twitter and Facebook and the crowdfunding sites, GoFundMe and YouCaring, and then using obituaries and public records to verify the women’s basic information. Working with student journalists from New York University, they reached out to family members.\n\n“Lost Mothers,” the series they produced, features a gallery of 134 women who died giving birth in 2016 and 16 feature obituaries. It’s a heartbreaking example of how data journalists succeed by putting a human face on the numbers their computers churn out.\n\nPatrick Holloway is a writer of stories and poems. He is the recent winner of the Molly Keane Creative Writing Award. He won second place in The Raymond Carver Short Story Contest and was the winner of HeadStuff Poem of the Year. He’s been published by Poetry Ireland Review, The Stinging Fly, Carve, Overland, The Irish Times, The Moth, Southword, among others. His story ‘Counting Stairs’ was highly commended for the Manchester Fiction Prize. He has been shortlisted for numerous other prizes including: Bath Short Story Prize, Moth Poetry Prize, Moth Short Story Prize, Bath Flash Fiction Prize, Dermot Healy Poetry Prize, Over The Edge New Writer of the Year Award (for both fiction and poetry) and the Alpine Fellowship for Fiction.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson you’ve learned as a writer?\n\nTo keep sending things out. I remember when I first started, a rejection meant the writing wasn’t good, so I’d stop sending that specific poem or story out. With time I realized the importance of researching where I was sending my work. Also, being kind to myself in terms of my writing. Being tough with what was on the page but by no means taking away its worth.\n\nWhat has been the biggest surprise of your writing life?\n\nHow difficult it can be. How, especially when you are not a full-time writer, you have to sacrifice other things in order to write. That can be challenging on relationships and on yourself. Difficult in terms of the craft, in terms of being disciplined and dedicated. Difficult in terms of rejections and self-doubt. Littered among the difficulties though are the joys of writing well, of surprising myself by winning some writing awards and seeing my words among those of brilliant writers I admire.\n\nIf you had to use a metaphor to describe yourself as a writer, what would it be and why?\n\nIt’d have to be tennis-related — my other passion. Especially writing a novel now, I see it like watching a 5 set grand slam final. There are so many ebbs and flows, lots of layers, lots of backstory, tension, rivalry and conflict. The points themselves are the sentences, some are hard and fast, others full of finesse. Games are chapters. I suppose the win is getting a publisher.\n\nWhat’s the single best piece of writing advice anyone ever gave you?\n\nI think a huge shift in how I saw writing and my relationship to it came when I was in the U.S and I had a class with Karen. E. Bender. She told me after to think about doing an MFA. It suddenly made writing something altogether different, gave it stature. Also, I suppose, it gave me the belief I didn’t know I was lacking.\n\nGreetings!\n\nHappy New Year! May 2022 bring safety, good health, and lots of reading and writing.\n\nAfter a week’s holiday, I’m looking forward to starting the New Year by sharing new Four Questions with… interviews, Craft Lessons, Readings to Savor, and much more. Tomorrow’s interview is with award-winning New Yorker staff writer and author Paige Williams who discovers the universal by tracking the granular.\n\nI hope the holidays brought you the best writer’s gift: books.\n\nFor Christmas, I got Jonathan Franzen’s acclaimed novel “Crossroads.” I’m looking forward to diving in.\n\nPlease consider two writing advice books that I just published. Both are available on Amazon in paperback and ebook editions through my author page or the direct links below.\n\nWriters on Writing: Inside the lives of 55 distinguished writers and editors.
