        "text": "September 29, 2011\n\nI gravitate towards books on writing and grammar in the hope that I'll become a better writer and reduce the tension and procrastination that often characterize a major deadline. Unfortunately, while I tend to be optimistic about improving my writing, much as I tend to look for the latest fitness books in the hope that this will encourage me to \"be more disciplined and healthier\", my follow through often falls short.\n\nIf you write and have reached the point where you feel ready to show your work to friends and critics, I know that you will benefit from the advice that Roy Clark offers above.\n\nIf you are still \"working on\" your writing, Help! For Writers provides practical advice and a technical approach to writing and thinking about writing. When writing and editing, we try to pare our language down to the essentials, much the way that artists, creatives, and even lawyers reduce their ideas to the essential elements. Clark suggests specific ways to do this, to reduce the unnecessary parts.\n\nI'm a timid writer. I tend towards putting things away, disappointed by the first draft. But chapter 11 \"My early drafts are littered with cliches\" helped me put things in perspective. The advice encourages us to realize that even mistakes and weaknesses can be used to bring us closer to our writing goals. Clark encourages clear thinking and careful use of language directly and through his tips and exercises.\n\nWhile some books target a specific goal, such as writing a screenplay or a novel in several steps or using certain structures, Help! For Writers points out that \"the writer does not have to get all Gothic to build cathedrals of words. On many occasions, the holy trinity of beginning, middle, and end will get the job done.\" Clark has gentle suggestions to help look at our problems and roadblocks and learn from them. Clark gives us examples from other writers which made the concepts concrete. Help! For Writers encourages us to write and gives specific and practical advice geared towards getting us to keep writing and to become better writers.\n\nISBN-10: 0316126713 - Hardcover $22.99\n\nPublisher: Little, Brown and Company (September 21, 2011), 304 pages.\n\nReview copy provided by the publisher.\n\nNovember 12, 2011\n\nThis book wasn't the best book I've ever read about writing, which I've only read a few, but it served it's purpose very well. It did exactly what you expected - it gave a lot of solutions to writing problems.\n\nAt points it gives specific advice or techniques that might work well for some people, but I like the fact that it stresses to kind of 'do your own thing'. It realizes not the same thing works for everyone but it gives you solutions you can try. Some solutions are precise like using notecards to develop the order of your story. Or sorting information into certain files so they're easily accessible for when you need them. Other are more general and things that you can find ways to do yourself. I liked that we got both kinds of advice.\n\nThe author did a good job of talking about making your work interesting, and actually making his work interesting to read. Nothing's worse then being taught by a teacher who doesn't even use their own advice. Luckily, this book wasn't like that. Even though some of the interesting stuff (the stuff not very helpful just there to keep the reader interested) I think could have been left out, but there wasn't too much of that.\n\nI also felt like some of the points trying to be made, weren't made very well. I couldn't exactly get what a certain story was supposed to convey or the point the author was making. Again, this didn't happen a lot, but I noticed it on several locations.\n\nOverall, there's so much material in the back of the book that's it's an excellent resource! You can tell the author knows what they are talking about and has been in the profession for a while, because there are some really helpful guidelines throughout the book and other books to even reference in the back. Glad I was able to get a copy of this book!\n\nNovember 7, 2011\n\nI teach writing classes and as a published author I almost blew this book off, but once I settled in to read I found Clark had included lots of great ideas I could use not only in my lectures, but also to motivate myself to keep writing. Well worth the time to read this one, even if you're an experienced author.\n\nJune 29, 2019\n\nRoy Peter Clark is a writer. He has written a number of books based on writing as a subject and how to improve. In that same vein, he wrote this particular book on how to get past various writing obstacles. Whether you are writing for an assignment or for yourself, this book has tons of help available.\n\nThe book goes over the process of producing a written work and comes up with plenty of ways to become better or produce better work.\n\nThere isn’t really much else to say about this book. I liked it for what it offered and breezed through the pages.\n\nJune 28, 2020\n\nI give this book 3.5 stars but rounded it up to 4 stars. The advice is probably best for journalists and non-fiction writers. Some of it is basic but might be useful to new writers.\n\nSeptember 24, 2011\n\nI have always tinkered with my writing and seem to gravitate to books and classes that aid me in that pursuit. Back in October of 2010 I had the privilege of reviewing Mr. Clark's book The Glamour of Grammar. His newest offering is another book that will be residing next to that one on my bookshelf for years to come.\n\nRoy Peter Clark's writing style is very easy for the reader to comprehend as well as enjoy. As in the previous book, he breaks the material down into bite-size chunks that the would-be writer ~ or experienced author, can easily digest. His manner and delivery are both entertaining and educational. I found myself laughing at some points and taking copious notes at others. His comments and observations sparked several ideas that I had to jot down immediately. The book is presented in logical order taking you through seven simple steps of the writing journey. The author wraps it up with a list of 25 of his favorite writing books. I found this to be yet another helpful resource from him.\n\nIn the post I wrote about my meeting with Diana Gabaldon, I noted that she told all of us that we don't have to write in a straight line from A-Z or start to finish. You can write chapter 12 before you write chapter 3. Go ahead and create the ending before the beginning... Roy Peter Clark has reinforced that permission and \"ah-ha\" moment with this book. In the section on \"Getting Your Act Together\", he shares several techniques to keep your written inventory organized. With wall boards, index cards and many, many more tricks of the trade, Mr. Clark helps the writer keep it all straight.\n\nThe book's opening line instructs the reader to consider Help! for Writers an owner's manual for their writing process. I think this is a very apt statement as I have already found myself referring back to the book more than once as I work on a project. I have a feeling that this will quickly become one of my \"go-to\" references when I come across a roadblock or just need a refresher.\n\nI definitely recommend this book to writers, would-be writers and students. It will become a staple on many home library reference shelves.\n\nFebruary 1, 2013\n\nHelp for Writers!\n\nby Roy Peter Clark\n\nA Book Review of Sorts\n\n210 Solutions to the Problems Every Writer Faces\n\nI came across this book at the library.\n\nI love these self-help books, on writing.\n\nYou've just sat down at your desk,\n\nYou're facing your monitor,\n\nready to pour your heart out.\n\nYou've pulled up a clean white sheet of paper,\n\nthrough the magic of Pages.( or Word )on your computer.\n\nYou've gotten all compfy.\n\nYour fingers are resting on the keyboard.\n\nYour wrists are placed evenly the desk.\n\nYou can feel your heartbeat!\n\nYour back is straight,\n\nYour feet are firmly on the floor.\n\nYou've practiced, at least a thousand times.\n\nYou've memorized,\n\nYour formatting.\n\nYour style.\n\nYou know exactly\n\nwhat you want to say.\n\nYou've researched,\n\nuntil you've exhausted every source.\n\nYou're ready to Go! GO! GO! GO!\n\nYou sit there, your face lit by the white screen\n\nYou're mind just went blank.\n\nYou have writer's block.\n\nHas that happened to you? \"I can't think of anything to write.\" Writers block. You have deadlines.\n\nThis book explains how to get your act together, starting with your writing space and focusing. The beginnings, middles and ends, in any order. Language, drafts, procrastination.\n\nRoy explains how to get out of that rut, stop procrastinating, and pick up those sagging middles, those never ending, endings. Cutting, editing, proofing and making those deadlines. Even listening to criticism. Something we would rather not do.\n\nI'd recommend this to all newbie writers. Written in a personal, easy to read style. I loved it!\n\nRoy Peter Clark also authored Writing Tools and The Glamour of Grammar.\n\nDog Brindle\n\nMarch 14, 2013\n\nClark's book has a ton of good information that every writer should know about organizing and keeping things handy. Mostly not new to me, but always good to remember what's in the toolbox. (And I did actually start looking up word derivations when seeking inspiration)\n\nOne handy idea: List the questions you want to answer, or what you want the reader to take away.\n\nAdvice I've heard elsewhere and like to remember -- engage the senses. (And conflict them)\n\nInteresting point if you want to write something big and feel like you don't have the time -- a page a day, 250 words, equals a book a year\n\nGood point about middles. Have a big event there. Put a gold coin along the path\n\nZero draft is a great concept. Write what you know or think you know without research to get a focus.\n\nOctober 6, 2015\n\nMostly relevant to journalists and nonfiction writers, I thought, but some very good insights on researching and organization in general.\n\nJanuary 20, 2018\n\nAt first I didn't like this book, until the 4th page. And then a lightbulb went off and wow. I began \"getting it\". I restarted and chose a chapter I thought would be of help of where I am as a writer. Ever so slowly I began. This time instead of rushing through to finish a chapter, I took a deep breath and began reading a small section of that chapter. My thinking began to see how it would help me as a writer. My mind wondered into my own use in the currently book I'm writing. It was a wonderful experience. I apologize Roy Peter Clark, the author, of jumping the gun and trying to run through your book. Like the cliche is said, if you want to eat an elephant you must do it one bite at a time. This is the way I view your book. I experienced your shared thoughts that flowed easily to my own writing. I learned to take a bite and stop. Turn your suggestion, thought, into stories from memory and new thoughts into more memories. I began with a library copy and 3/4 the way through the book I purchase a hard copy for my permanent shelt. I believe this book will keep giving, helping, my writing for years to come. This book, for me, has a much higher rating than just six stars. I am so glad I have a permanent copy of my shelf. I look forward to re-reading every chapter one bite at a time over the many years ahead.\n\nNovember 4, 2019\n\nRoy Peter Clark suggests even good writers can \"take wrong turns. The story is too long, the story is too short; there's too much material\" and other barriers to getting on with writing including writer's block. The author offers seven simple categories through which to view your writing experience. None are new to a seasoned writer and are recognizable are realities of a writing life. Clark presents realistic, well structured interventions to transcend the common writing challenges into productive options. He does though begin with a viewpoint that is framed in negative language - \"I can't, I hate, I don't know, limited, littered, slow, miss, never ends well, resent criticism.\" It almost stopped me from purchasing the book. A few positive subtitles would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, it's a good read.\n\nOctober 10, 2021\n\nI have become a huge fan of Roy Peter Clark. It started with the impulse purchase of The Art of X-Ray Reading, which prompted me to assign myself the task of reading (most of) the 25 great works of literature examined in the book. I'm still working on that project, and am enjoying it immensely.\n\nIn the meantime, I've picked up a couple more of his books and just finished Help! For Writers. It has, indeed, been helpful as I review feedback from beta readers and tackle what I hope will be the final round of revisions on my own work-in-progress. I especially appreciate the chapter on Finding Focus.\n\nClark's writing style is approachable and engaging. He even had me laughing a few times. This is a book I can see myself referencing again and again in the future.\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\nI read this because I LOVED \"The Art of X-Ray Reading.\" Fiction writers, read that instead for craft lessons. Better yet, check out the amazing audiobook by Jefferson Mays. I feel like this book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a manual for nonfiction (journalism) writing or fiction. In wanting to cover both boxes it skewed toward more helpful to nonfiction. This would have been great to read as a news reporter in college. As an aspiring fiction writer, this left a lot to be desired and wasn't worth the money or investment so much as Art of X-Ray reading. A decent book, but I didn't get out what I hoped I would.\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nRoy Peter Clark's book helps you with more than \"210 Solutions to the Problems Every Writer Faces.\" Nearly two dozen chapters headline the problem you're facing. He helps \"get your act together\" and \"find the focus.\" Short chapters often end with summaries, reflections, bullet lists and more. He is indeed America's writing coach. I have been lucky to participate in his seminars and hear him speak, most recently at the Tampa Bay Times Festival of Reading in November 2019. You'll find quick help and inspiration here, whether you're an author, journalist, business professional, teacher or student.\n\nOctober 20, 2018\n\nA useful manual for writers who want tips on how to become better at one's craft. I gave it 4 stars because it's not as useful as the advice Roy Peter Clark laid out in his previous book, Writing Tools. This book seemed (and the author seemed to confirm that in the book) as it was written randomly, without a clear target goal. There's no one thing you can take away, but random — yet still good — tips for different situations writers often go through. If you have never read anything from Clark, start with the book mentioned before, and then move to this one.\n\nWant to read\n\nSeptember 10, 2020\n\nHonestly, I was gonna pass on this book, but the synopsis' advice on editing was to \"watch the deleted scenes feature of a DVD, and ask yourself why those scenes were left on the cutting-room floor\".\n\nAnd that's actually a pretty lit idea.\n\nIt's supposedly directed more towards journalism, but there's a possibility of getting some useful tips regardless of that. I was ignoring journalism most of my life, but gained interest in it a while ago, so maybe this book could be of help to me in the future.\n\nApril 29, 2023\n\nWhile Help! For Writers is written by a (renowned) Journalism Teacher much of the advice is very applicable to fiction authors.\n\nThis book isn't a plot/character/sentence structure type book, its a very practical, holistic focus on many many aspects of writing - including Writer's Block, habit building, self-care, sensible perceptions and research and so on.\n\nEven if that doesn't sound super attractive to folk looking for writing books on more exciting topics - this is really useful reading, especially if you find yourself struggling in any way.\n\nFebruary 27, 2021\n\nIt's probably unfair rating this against some gripping novels I've recently read to be honest but hey ho, that's where I am. 3 stars to me means it was good, a decent read but not something that makes me say 'thats incredible'. The book does exactly as you would expect though. I took away some great tips and I'm happy I read it. Large sections seem to be aimed more at journalists and those writing professional papers than fiction writers. Overall, a good decent read.\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\nThis was good and worth reading. So far, I've really enjoyed Roy Peter Clark's writing style and value his tips. This is an earlier work (compared to Murder Your Darlings - 2020) and I don't know whether that is one reason why Murder Your Darlings seems to be better (it could also be the things I know I need to hear).\n\nREGARDLESS of the why, this is worth the time and provides some great tips. I'll definitely be reading more from Roy Peter Clark.\n\nAugust 30, 2017\n\nA great and practical book on the craft of writing. Focuses on breaking through writer's block, how to best work with editors, ways to make manuscripts more concise and precise, ways to structure a story. Equally meant for journalistic writing as well as fiction writers. Solidly done and very useful.\n\nNovember 20, 2021\n\nReviewed as help for fiction writer\n\nSome excellent advice for writers of fiction here. A lot of the book is aimed at non fiction and journalism. If you're reading this for fiction then some skimming is in order. The book would be more useful in the real as opposed to kindle format.\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nA terrific book which should sit on the shelf of any writer, and it won’t have a chance to get dusty. In his delightful style, Roy Peter Clark elegantly addresses the problems and difficulties which accompany various stages of the writing process. Totaling to the 210 solutions billed on the cover, Help! will have answers to the daily foibles of writing difficulties at whatever level.\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nI am a big fan of Roy Peter Clark, and I really enjoyed this book. I’ve actually enjoyed everything I’ve read by him and had the opportunity to sit in on a workshop he was leading once. Totally great guy, very down to earth and loves language and teaching other people to write well. I recommend this and his other books to everyone I know who is a writer.\n\nShelved as 'dnf'\n\nNovember 20, 2019\n\nThis is a book on journalism, and I picked it up because the inside cover makes it sound like it's about fiction writing. No doubt a good book if you're a journalist looking for writing advice (seriously, it's a very well organized book with practical concrete tips), just marketed inaccurately.\n\nNovember 29, 2019\n\nI was a bit bummed out that the advice in this book cane from more of a journalistic perspective (not as helpful for writing fiction), but the expense of advice and writing troubleshooting was pretty impressive!"
