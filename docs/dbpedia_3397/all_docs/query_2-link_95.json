        "meta_description": "Available in: Paperback. Roy Peter Clark - the most influential writing teacher in the US - collects lifelong wisdom into 50 essential tools for writers of all kinds. Clark has whittled down almost 30 years of experience in journalism (writing and teaching) into WRITING TOOLS, a series of 50 short essays on different aspects of writing. Organised into four sections, 'Nuts and Bolts', 'Special Effects', 'Blueprints for Stories', and 'Useful Habits', WRITING TOOLS is infused with more than 200 examples from journalism and literature to illustrate Clark's points. Accessible, entertaining, inspiring, and above all, useful for every type of writer, from high school student to novelist, WRITING TOOLS is destined to become a classic.",
