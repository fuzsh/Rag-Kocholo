        "text": "By many accounts, Roy Peter Clark\n\nis America’s writing coach, a teacher devoted to creating a nation of\n\nwriters. A Google search on his name\n\nreveals an astonishing web of influence, not just in the United States,\n\nbut also around the world. His work has erased many boundaries. A Ph.D.\n\nin medieval literature, he is widely considered one of the most\n\ninfluential writing teachers in the rough-and-tumble world of newspaper\n\njournalism. With a deep background in traditional media, his work has\n\nilluminated, on the Internet, the discussion of writing. He has gained\n\nfame by teaching writing to children, and he has nurtured Pulitzer\n\nPrize-winning writers such as Thomas French and Diana Sugg.\n\nHe is a teacher who writes, and a writer who teaches. That combination\n\ngives his most recent book, “Writing Tools,” a special credibility.\n\nMore credibility comes from Clark’s long service at The Poynter\n\nInstitute. Clark has worked full-time at Poynter since 1979 as director\n\nof the writing center, dean of the faculty, senior scholar and vice\n\npresident.\n\nClark was born in 1948 on the Lower East Side of New York City and\n\nraised on Long Island, where he attended Catholic schools. He graduated\n\nfrom Providence College in Rhode Island with a degree in English and earned a Ph.D. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 1977 Clark was hired by the St. Petersburg Times to become one of America’s first writing coaches. He worked with the American Society of Newspaper Editors\n\nto improve newspaper writing nationwide. Because of his work with ASNE,\n\nClark was elected as a distinguished service member, a rare honor for a\n\njournalist who has never edited a newspaper."
