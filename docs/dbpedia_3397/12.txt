By many accounts, Roy Peter Clark

is America’s writing coach, a teacher devoted to creating a nation of

writers. A Google search on his name

reveals an astonishing web of influence, not just in the United States,

but also around the world. His work has erased many boundaries. A Ph.D.

in medieval literature, he is widely considered one of the most

influential writing teachers in the rough-and-tumble world of newspaper

journalism. With a deep background in traditional media, his work has

illuminated, on the Internet, the discussion of writing. He has gained

fame by teaching writing to children, and he has nurtured Pulitzer

Prize-winning writers such as Thomas French and Diana Sugg.

He is a teacher who writes, and a writer who teaches. That combination

gives his most recent book, “Writing Tools,” a special credibility.

More credibility comes from Clark’s long service at The Poynter

Institute. Clark has worked full-time at Poynter since 1979 as director

of the writing center, dean of the faculty, senior scholar and vice

president.

Clark was born in 1948 on the Lower East Side of New York City and

raised on Long Island, where he attended Catholic schools. He graduated

from Providence College in Rhode Island with a degree in English and earned a Ph.D. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 1977 Clark was hired by the St. Petersburg Times to become one of America’s first writing coaches. He worked with the American Society of Newspaper Editors

to improve newspaper writing nationwide. Because of his work with ASNE,

Clark was elected as a distinguished service member, a rare honor for a

journalist who has never edited a newspaper.
