The group was named after the area code of their hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nLeMisha, Irish, and Kameelah attended the Las Vegas Academy of Performing Arts. Irish, Orish, and LeMisha sang occasionally in the lobby of Caesars Palace where they were discovered by actor\\comedian, Sinbad.\n\nSinbad visited their home in order to convince the girls’ parents to send the three of them to Atlanta for a convention and music competition.\n\nEven though the girls missed the deadline for entry, Sinbad used his name to get them in. The group (under their original name “Sweeta than Suga”) came in 2nd place in the competition. As the convention was ending, the girls met Michael Bivins of New Edition & Bell Biv Devoe, who agreed to work with them.\n\nThe group were briefly joined by their cousin, Amelia Childs.
