My sister was a teen when I was a baby when NE made their debut, but we can all admit New Edition made R&B history with this legendary boy group. I was invited to Ronnie’s 50th bithday celebration in Atlanta. 1778 Events along with Ciroc French Vanilla hosted a star-studded 50th birthday celebration for New Edition legend Ronnie DeVoe. Hundreds of fans and industry friends packed the all-new REVEL in West Midtown Atlanta to wish “Big Ron” a happy birthday.\n\nRonnie and his beautiful wife Shamari (Blaque). You can tell he truly loves his wife. Oh and say congrats, they just gave birth to twin boys a month ago!\n\nDeVoe’s wife Shamari Fears-DeVoe, his mother Flo DeVoe and fellow Bell Biv DeVoe partners Michael Bivins and Ricky Bell attended the exclusive affair, which included a VIP Meet & Greet in the Ciroc Experience Room.\n\nRonnie is not aging. What is your secret??? Happy 50th? Where is the fountain of youth water you are drinking? He literally is barely aging over the years. 50 looks good…really good on him! 50 is the new 25!\n\nDamion Hall (1 half of 90s Group “Guy”) performed for Ronnie’s birthday.\n\nBig Tigger is everywhere in Atlanta. Most events in Atlanta are hosted by Big Tig, I need him to host something for me in the future!\n\nKelly Price performing some of her biggest R&B hits for Ronnie’s birthday.\n\nSurprise performances by 112, Damion Hall, Kelly Price and Cherrelle. Of course, BBD took the stage for a mini concert of hits such as “N.E. Heartbreak,” “When Will I See You Smile Again” and the forever classic “Poison.”\n\nWhat an elaboate cake. It was beautiful and lots of momentos and nostalgia for NE, BBD and Ronnie over the years.\n\nI want to say once again Happy 50th Birthday Ronnie. You’re still my favorite!\n\nWere you a fan of New Edition or BBD? Doesnt Ronnie still look good?"
