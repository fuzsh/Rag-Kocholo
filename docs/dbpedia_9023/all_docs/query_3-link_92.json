        "text": "Happy birthday to Roman and Ronald! Shamari and Ronnie DeVoe’s twin sons celebrated their second birthdays earlier this week.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BwgNcHDB7y1/\n\nThe DeVoe twins rang in the big number two on Sunday. “On this incredible, amazing day, July 14, 2017, GOD blessed @bigrondevoe and I with our most precious gifts, Ronald Boyd III and Roman Elijah I,” Shari write online. “Happy 2nd Birthday to our young kings,” she exclaimed.\n\nShamari went on to tell her sons, “You did it @devoetwins! You’ve finally entered the ‘Terrific Two’ stage of your life! Mommy and daddy are so proud of you. Special shouts to those that continue to support, pray for and speak life into our family! We don’t take any of your gifts, words, time or positive energy for granted. We love you all.”\n\nMany fans saw the family dynamic that the DeVoes shared among themselves during the last season of Real Housewives of Atlanta. Shamari and Ronnie gave an inside look at their lives as parents of twin boys and the adjustments that came with the family’s expansion.\n\n“[Producers] reached out to me when I was pregnant last year about joining the cast and because I was pregnant and I was on bed rest, I had to decline,” Shamari said when asked about her decision to be a cast member on RHOA after her children’s birth. “I had to make sure that my babies baked as long as possible because my oldest son, he wasn’t growing as fast as his [brother], so they wanted to make sure that I was being watched 24 hours,” the celebrity mom added.\n\nWill Roman and Ronald follow after their father with a career in the music industry? We’ll have to keep our eyes on the DeVoe family to find out! Stay tuned for more Real Housewives of Atlanta baby news!\n\nPhotos: @leonceleazard"
