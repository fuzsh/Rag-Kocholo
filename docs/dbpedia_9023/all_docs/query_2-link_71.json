        "text": "Being the center of attention is nothing new for Shamea Yvonne Morton. Whenever the Decatur, GA native enters a room, she manages to make a potent impression before speaking one word. At 4 years of age, she was not only a member of her church choir but was also leading it. It was the same age that she was named “Little Miss Tiny Star.” Growing up she would transform the fireplace stoop into a stage where she would entertain her family for hours with her electrifying vocal abilities and costume changes. Feeling the need to forge a creative identity for their daughter, Morton’s parents enrolled her into dance classes. She quickly mastered the art form, particularly Hip-Hop and Jazz and incorporated her new childhood love into her routines becoming a double threat.\n\nNow a force behind the mic and on the dance floor, Morton was recruited into singing groups that included Shamari Fears-Devoe (formerly of Blaque) as well as Keri Hilson, who was a member of Pretty Tony where they were signed to Grammy Award Winning music producer Anthony Dent (Destiny’s Child, Beyonce’, KeKe Palmer). Morton was also a part of the quartet Co-Ed, which was comprised of 2 girls and 2 guys where they exploded onto the music scene and Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart with the radio-friendly hit “Roll Wit Me.”\n\nBlending her passion for music, dance and having a good time, Morton was ready to take her skills to the next level and joined the Atlanta Hawks cheerleading squad (2003-2014). She also cheered for the Atlanta Falcons for 5 seasons serving as captain from 2011-2012 and managed to dance for the Georgia Force Arena Football League for 4 seasons. Morton, who also studied Broadcast Journalism at Morris Brown College, holds a dual degree in Psychology and Sociology from Georgia State University, which has served her well in her acting career. She also uses her degree in psychology by being a contracted interpersonal life coach and consultant for law firms in the metro Atlanta area and major corporations. Her dance and cheerleading experience have also helped as she embarked on a life of thespianism having already grasped the key aspects of success: discipline, time management and taking directions.\n\nMorton’s big break came in 2002 when she appeared in the critically hailed film Drumline alongside Zoe Saldana’s character. But before she landed that job, the former “Miss Southwest DeKalb'' had minor stints on network television and the small stage including BJ Hughes of the Alliance Theater’s play “Olympic Village” and Elaine Hicks’ “Illusions.” From those performances, Morton earned a principal role in the celebrated independent film ''Lesson Before Love” which proved to be a pivotal point in her career. Tyler Perry Studios casting director Rhavynn Drummer was in the audience and was so impressed with the young actress that she championed her for future work. During this time Morton also secured an agent with Atlanta Models and Talent and is now represented by Pantheon. Her next projects were parts in Travis Hunter’s “Dark Child” and a part in Tyler Perry’s hit stage play “The Haves and the Have Nots.” She had a memorable cameo alongside Lance Gross in Perry’s critically hailed movie “Temptation.” Morton played the role of Dallas Austin’s baby momma in the TLC biopic “Crazy, Sexy, Cool.” She was also a waitress in Ride Along 2. She was a vampire in Meet the Blacks 2.\n\nShe attributes much of her success to her faith in God, her ability to effectively develop and maintain healthy relationships as well as her continuous pursuit of perfecting her craft. Morton, who made Jezebel Magazine’s annual Most Beautiful Atlantan’s list in 2012, studied Improv at the renowned Nick Conti’s Professional Actor’s Studio and took acting classes at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. Morton joined the cast of the Real Housewives of Atlanta in Season 8 and is still casted as a friend of the show. She is the official in game host of the National Basketball Association’s Atlanta Hawks and has been in this role for the past 8 seasons. Morton hosted the 2021 & 2022 NBA ALL STAR games.\n\nWhile she is currently co-host on V-103’s The Big Tigger Morning Show, Shamea has an extensive radio history. She began as an on-air personality alongside Ryan Cameron of The Ryan Cameron Morning Show on Atlanta’s V-103 and had her own show Monday through Friday mornings from 1-6am‬. She worked on the Streetz 94.5 morning show alongside Yung Joc and Comedian Shawty Shawty. She’s done tons of voice over work. One of the most notable being the voice of the NCAA Championship games. While she aspires to be the best entertainer and multi-media mogul in the business, Morton hasn’t lost sight of her ultimate life purpose and that’s to connect and continue giving to her community and inspire and motivate people along the way.‬‬"
