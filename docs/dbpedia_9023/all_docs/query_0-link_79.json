        "text": "Real Housewives of Atlanta fans can always count on Marlo Hampton to throw shade. Especially at a new cast member who got a full-time spot instead of her. Marlo has been jabbing Eva Marcille for her “lack of personality” all season long.\n\nBut, it seems like Marlo has moved on to a new target: Shamari DeVoe. During the last episode, Marlo accused Shamari of having a drinking problem. In the episode before that, Shamari got wasted at NeNe Leakes’ party and threw up on Eva’s leg. Of course, that accusation and the puke session are not inextricably linked, but Marlo is running with her claims.\n\nMarlo and Cynthia Bailey joined Andy Cohen for a recent Watch What Happens Live episode. And as expected, Marlo pretty much stole the show. There were no majorly quotable moments from Cynthia. At least she looked good. We can always rely on her for that.\n\nAnyway, they discussed NeNe’s ridiculous closet freakout. She chased after Kandi Burruss, Porsha Williams, and a cameraman for going into her closet. Something even happened with a belt, but no one has explained it. Yet.\n\nAndy said, “Marlo, when you watched it back, did you think that maybe you had instigated it a little bit?” Of course, Marlo told him, “Absolutely not. I was just being shady, like funny. ‘All your friends are over here. Let me go see your closet.’ I don’t even remember saying that.” Sure, Marlo.\n\nAnd what about that belt? During the last episode, a producer asked Porsha about it, but she was clearly uncomfortable. Porsha said, “Nothing happened with the belt. I’m not really talking about that because our relationship will be ruined.” That statement alone said enough! So much for “not talking about it.”\n\nMarlo told Andy, “I don’t know what happened with the belt.” Once again, sure, Marlo. Thankfully, Andy shared that they did discuss this at the reunion.\n\nMoving on, Andy asked Marlo, “That is a strong accusation to say someone has a drinking problem, right?” Marlo was not playing around. Instead, she declared, “No, it’s not an accusation. It’s fact. Yes, it’s facts.” Is it though? Does this constitute slander? Or does shade not have legal ramifications?\n\nRELATED: Marlo Hampton Calls Eva Marcille A “Compulsive Liar”; Says She “Can’t Be Her Friend”\n\nFinally, Cynthia said something. She remarked, “I don’t know if Shamari has a drinking problem. I just know that she has no problem drinking.” How long was she sitting on that quote?\n\nAfter, Andy asked Cynthia, “How long has it been since you talked to Peter [Thomas]?” Has she talked to him since he got arrested for writing fraudulent checks? Cynthia shared, “I have not spoken to him since then, but prior to that. I spoke to him maybe three weeks before that.”\n\nShe also admitted that she was “surprised” by the arrest, but she didn’t say much else. As per usual, but that was probably a smart call.\n\nThen, they addressed NeNe unfollowing (almost) everyone in the cast on Instagram. As of this moment, she’s only following Marlo and Shamari. Yes, she even unfollowed her loyal soldier Cynthia.\n\nRELATED: Shamari Devoe Says Marlo Hampton Uses People’s Credit Cards To Buy Fashion She Can’t Afford\n\nMarlo teased, “You’re going to have to tune into the reunion for that one.” Then Andy said, “By the way, the control room is telling me that NeNe also unfollowed me. She unfollowed me on Instagram for sure and they are now checking Twitter.” Then, he shared, “She is still following on Twitter.”\n\nThe next day, NeNe tweeted, “LIES! I wasn’t following Andy on IG just as he doesn’t follow any housewives.” Andy quoted that tweet and added, “Nene is right! We follow each other on twitter.” She still unfollowed almost all of her costars. That’s a pretty big deal. Hopefully, the reunion makes up for an abysmally boring season.\n\nLater in the episode, Marlo said, “You pissed off my sister, Andy.” But he does have a say in whether she remains on the show, right? Maybe NeNe shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds her.\n\nA caller asked the go-to question when Marlo is around: “What is your profession.” Marlo began, “You know what, I’m going to answer that for the hundredth time and that’s OK.”\n\nThen, she explained, “I told you guys last time my grandmother taught me at a young age how to invest in property. I’ve own properties for years. I’ve also dated a billionaire, who also taught me.”\n\nRELATED: Nene Leakes Clarifies Comments About Tanya Sam’s Fashion Sense; Dishes On Marlo Hampton’s Makeover Attempt\n\nMarlo continued, “It somehow led to me sitting here with Andy Cohen. This platform allows me to make plenty of money posting my businesses.” She had even more to say though. Marlo added, “I sell jewelry. I have stores. I’m an entrepreneur. I’m a hustler.” And she’s a Friend of the Housewives. Hopefully, she’s not throwing shade and stirring the pot for free.\n\nAfter a super shady season, it was only logical that Andy would ask about Marlo’s relationship with Eva these days. At first, it seemed like the two had moved past their illogical beef when Marlo said, “Eva and I are good. We’re good.”\n\nBut then, Marlo got super shady. Marlo shared, I’m loving her because now she’s an Instagram model. She has some amazing pictures. She is. Her last five posts are freaking amazing.” She wasn’t down though. Marlo finished her with this remark: “She’s AWOL from the runway, but she’s killing Instagram. She really is.” Damn.\n\nShe did have one nice thing to say about Eva though. Marlo admitted, “I loved her wedding dresses. I really did.” Yes, Eva had multiple wedding dresses even though she was thousands of dollars over the budget.\n\nRELATED: Eva Marcille Doesn’t Know Why Marlo Hampton Keeps Coming For Her\n\nClick through the gallery below to see pictures of Marlo Hampton and Cynthia Bailey on Watch What Happens Live.\n\nTELL US- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MARLO’S CLAIMS THAT SHAMARI HAS A DRINKING PROBLEM?
