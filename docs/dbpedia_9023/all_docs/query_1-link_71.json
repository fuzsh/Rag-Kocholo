        "text": "The ATL Bravolebs showed up and showed out for The Real Housewives of Potomac’s Candiace Dillard Bassett’s concert on Monday, October 24. In the house for the Atlanta show were The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s Kandi Burruss, Kenya Moore, Drew Sidora, Sanya Richards-Ross, Marlo Hampton, and Monyetta Shaw, as well as Married to Medicine’s Dr. Heavenly Kimes and Quad Webb.\n\nOne of five scheduled stops on Candiace’s Deep Space tour, the City Winery Atlanta show also featured special guests, including RHOA alum Shamari DeVoe and R&B star Q Parker. If you weren’t lucky enough to be in the audience, the RHOA and Married to Medicine ladies have you covered with several highlights shared on social media.\n\nFirst up, Kandi showed off one of the RHOP singer’s concert T-shirts in an Instagram Stories video, saying, “OK, Candiace with the merch.” A follow-up clip also showed her “vibing to [Candiace]” with Kenya, Sanya, and Monyetta. One fan’s video showed all the women dancing to “Drive Back,” specifically, and Drew even joined Candiace onstage at one point, as seen in another social media post.\n\nAs for the ladies representing Married to Medicine, Quad posted some pre-concert pics with Candiace, encouraging her Instagram followers to “pull up” and “show her some love.” Later, Heavenly gave her honest review of Candiace’s Atlanta show. “My girl [Candiace] KILLED it tonight,” she wrote, adding a flame emoji. “So proud of her and everything she is accomplishing.”\n\nAlso sharing a backstage video with Candiace, Heavenly playfully called out the RHOP ’Wife for her messy social media behavior. “I blame my mother. I get it from her,” Candiace joked back, referencing matriarch Dorothy Dillard. “That’s the original smart mouth.”\n\nIn the comments section of Heavenly’s post, Candiace wrote, “Lolllll. Why are we a mess?” to which the Married to Medicine doctor replied, “WE can’t help it.” Naturally, both Bravolebs added plenty of crying-laughing emojis as well.\n\nCandiace previously spoke about her Atlanta tour stop on FOX 5’s Good Day Atlanta on September 8. During the sit-down, an “excited” Candiace pointed out that she was born and raised in the Peach State.\n\n“It was really important to me that Atlanta get a special welcome from me, because this is the place that made me who I am. It’s the place where I learned to be a woman, I learned how to be a young lady. I am a Southern girl at heart; Southern hospitality runs through my veins,” she explained at the time. “So being able to come home to a musical city where music is so respected and loved, and hopefully get some of that respect and be taken seriously in my music, is really important to me.”\n\nWatch The Real Housewives of Potomac on Bravo Sundays at 8/7c and the next day on Peacock.
