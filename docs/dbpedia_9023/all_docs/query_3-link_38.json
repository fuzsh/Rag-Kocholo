        "text": "Ronnie and Shamari DeVoe celebrated their twin sons’ birthday on July 14th.\n\nShamari couldn’t contain her joy as she wished her boys a Happy Birthday on Instagram, saying, “Another revolution around the ☀️for our boys is complete! Man, that’s a lot of #PeanutGang energy!\n\nAdding, ” Happy 6th Birthday Ronald and Roman! Mommy and Daddy love you for life…!”\n\nTo celebrate the special day, the Devoes organized an Astronaut-themed party for their sons.\n\n“Ronald and Roman’s 6th birthday was one for the ages! Mommy and Daddy are so proud of you!” Shamari and Ronnie wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe Devoes embraced parenthood later in life, with Ronnie becoming a father on the cusp of age 50. In 2017, he spoke to Rollingout about the unique experience of fatherhood at 50.\n\n“Fatherhood is like no other! From stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and movies that just break records of your life story and lifetime achievement awards and all of these different accolades like if they sit here, then having kids is like on the sun right now like the furthest star that’s how much of a difference it is. It’s like I’m whole now — it’s crazy!”\n\nBoth Ronnie and Shamari DeVoe have made significant waves in the music industry. Ronnie, renowned as a popular rapper, holds acclaim as a member of two R&B groups – New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe. The group Bell Biv DeVoe struck gold with their smash hit “Poison,” a true ’90s anthem.\n\nShamari, on the other hand, made her mark as a member of the R&B girl group Blaque, which gained popularity in the early 2000s. Although the group later parted ways in 2008, Shamari’s talent continued to shine bright.\n\nPresently, Ronnie and Shamari DeVoe are back on Couples Retreat. They previously appeared in the second season and just finished the third season, dealing with Ronnie’s busy work schedule.\n\nRonnie and Shamari were married on March 10, 2006. The couple’s relationship had been ongoing since 2001."
