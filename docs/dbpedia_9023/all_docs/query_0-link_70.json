        "text": "I wanted to communicate that being different or not being the “norm” is okay. People of color are constantly shamed for their traditional food, clothing, hair, history, and skin color. It has become so bad that every community favors lighter skin people of color with more “European” features. All around Africa, Asia, and Latin America there are creams and cosmetics to make your skin lighter and not only is it erasing your family bloodline but it also is very harmful. While I was designing my art work I thought it would be a good idea to draw 4 women from different countries that are all of color. I copied the stars for the American flag to get the right shape. I made their hands connected to show that they are all one. I put the women’s country flags behind them to show that you should be confident of your background and not try to change yourself to fit the beauty standard. I made sure to draw the traditional clothing on each of the women to show how beautiful their culture is.\n\nI want to communicate the idea of Climate change, and that this is what our world is turning into, with the amount of trash in the water, and how the water is heating up and the icebergs are breaking, and animals are getting separated from their families and dying, ultimately resulting in animals becoming endangered and going extinct.\n\nThrough my art I want to inspire people to feel ok being different and to love everyone because we are all human and all trying our best. To create my art I used paint sticks, sharpie markers, bright colors, and shapes. The reason I used circles is because I find them to be very calming to look at.\n\nEye For Equity is a collaborative art project created by Mr. Solomon’s 4th grade students, Mr. Solomon and Peggy Leonard, the Lakewood art teacher. Each student created an eye and the shapes were collaged together inside the glasses. Mr. Solomon wrote this poem as our Artist Statement..\n\nGlasses covered in children’s eyes\n\nHalf our size but twice as wise\n\nEvery gaze a unique view\n\nA noble cause we must pursue\n\nThrough these lens a tapestry spins\n\nWhere justice and inclusion wins\n\nEyes that see a human, a whole\n\nNurtures our heart and cradles our soul\n\nWithout them I may not see\n\nWhat works for you and not for me\n\nBut equity’s lens makes clear the light\n\nWhich guides the way towards what is right.\n\nWe chose to create the differences that each of us have with in our class. We learned that many of us come from different cultures, races, speak different languages, eat different foods, learn differently and have many different unique qualities. What we really want is…. for people to just love us as we are no matter our differences. Because we are all just human wanting to be loved and accepted no matter what!\n\nI have used the art form Mithila (which is an Indian folk art having its origins in Bihar and Jharkhand) to showcase sincere expressions for such inclusivity with different types of disabilities of people at school, in parks and in the workplace. Mithila folk art is a style of painting which is practiced extensively in India and Nepal. Colors are created using natural dyes and pigments. Since this Mithila art form has been in vogue for thousands of years, the themes of Mithila paintings are generally religious practices and culture. I used this art form to depict the social scene which signifies how differences can be embraced and inclusivity practiced.\n\nMy artwork is a criticism of society’s tendency to judge people based on appearance. To initiate this project, I asked people around me “if you could express yourself through a painting, what would it look like?” I created their portraits based on their responses and then I designed doors that allowed viewers to open the panel of each portrait to reveal the true self of each person. The portraits focused on viewable features, while the inside reflects the person’s dreams, thoughts, and personality. The biggest panel has an unfinished painting of a frame, and viewers will find a mirror inside. The last confrontation of the viewers is with themselves as I want them to reflect and recognize that no one perfectly fits a stereotype and deserves an unjust judgment made of them because of their eyes, number of wrinkles, how curly their hair is, or which shade of foundation they use.\n\nI’ve developed a unique art style which I’ve coined, “Indie Pop Art,” which celebrates the noble beauty and divine nature of people of indigenous descent and contemporary American culture. Incorporating my love of aboriginal dot painting and the use of negative and positive space to weave across canvases, I draw power from roots deep in sacred African and Native American art, spirituality, and ritual. This art piece was inspired by my favorite book and the character “Pecola,” whose story resonated with me and millions of other little black girls who struggled to fit the typical standard of beauty thus wishing for “blue eyes,” including Oprah Winfrey and Viola Davis.\n\nTo me “Embracing Our Differences” must also include embracing and celebrating what makes every individual beautiful, unique, and worthy of love. You never know, they may grow up to be an Academy Award winning actress or the first black woman billionaire.\n\nThis drawing shows representation. No one is the same; we all have quirks. The drawing shows eight or more women who are looking at the board and each feels represented. It doesn’t matter what you look like, your race, orientation, or sexual identity, where you’re from, or whether you have a disability. We all bleed the same, and we deserve to be respected and represented. Representation matters and makes a difference in the life of each person. I used the painting “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer as a reference for the paintings placed on the wall, so that they would look similar with the girls who watched them. Embracing our differences is a very important step for change–we are all pearls; we need and want to be represented.\n\nMy art piece shows a woman who is wearing headphones tuning out all of the hurtful words that are surrounding her. I made this to show people to be confident and not to listen to the hurtful things others say. I sketched this on a sheet of paper, then took a picture and traced it digitally. Then I added details and the words, and colored the whole piece. This artwork represents the way we reject negativity and feel confident in ourselves no matter what people say about us. No matter how mean people are, you can always find the good, and create your own happiness.\n\nWith this art, we bring into the diversity discussion the face of an Arab woman who is not bound by all the stereotyping that surrounds Middle Eastern culture. Our woman is multi-layered, symbolically pieced together by different media reflecting the many perspectives that have left their mark on her and made a unique, individualistic self. Having already broken with many traditional rules, she stands ready to tell her story; her image speaks for itself and allows the viewer to enter the artwork and explore the meaning of the objects of which she is made. What is the common connecting denominator and how is she related to us? Our goal for this work is to help people find the connections and question their built-in and often-unexamined attitudes/unwritten rules.\n\nUsing acrylic paints I created a painting representing body dysmorphia. I decided to make the figure a ballerina because many dancers fall under body dysmorphia, eating disorders, and body image issues due to the strict ideal body image represented and taught from childhood. In my painting, the ballerina is very malnourished and thin, but as she looks into the mirror she sees herself as much larger than she actually is. I added a nutrition wrapper for the background of the mirror to represent counting calories which is something I did for a period of time when I didn’t feel confident in my own skin. Body dysmorphia is something so many people go through as they try to reach the extremely demanding beauty standards of society which usually leads to eating disorders. I currently have a close friend in the hospital recovering from anorexia, so this theme means a lot to me and I definitely think that there should be more body positivity in today’s society.\n\nPower, wealth, influence: with these three shiny things abused, you can buy all the cars and diamonds and exit passes from jail. When it becomes easy to be above the law, to bend the rules, and to play God in a broken system that is rigged to be in one’s favor; justice becomes seemingly ‘exclusive’ despite upholding the very guise of fairness itself. This might not be the case in a more ideal society, but our reality behind rose-tinted windows is that Lady Justice has not always been blindfolded from prejudice and corruption. In countries like mine, you would turn deaf from the amount of times you hear the creaks of the scales being tipped out of balance. I hope to simply portray and acknowledge such rotten injustices.\n\nWomen and girls as actors and builders of an equal world over which they watch and deploy their full potential. This work reminds us of the important value of the contribution of women and girls to society when their rights are respected. It symbolizes a fair and shared world where everyone contributes to equality; it also represents the possibility for everyone to participate in the different spheres of society without discriminatory barriers. It means equal opportunities, an end to violence, harassment, and prejudice against women.\n\nWe all possess great gifts enabling us to bring comfort to others. Whether it is just a smile when passing a stranger on the street, a casual wave or holding a hand to reassure or show affection. We can’t forget the things that make us so uniquely human. We are endowed with a great power to ease the suffering of others through the simplest human expressions. Use these wonderful gifts every day!\n\nI guess they say you can’t buy love;\n\nSo instead, I’m giving out free hugs;\n\nFor no reason at all, I’m doing it just because;\n\nI’m embracing our differences to create the vision that Martin dreamed of;\n\nBecause we live in a world full of hate, division, and people that judge;\n\nBut I give love because I need love;\n\nAnd I know it exists because I’ve seen love;\n\nAnd to be loved, you have to be love;\n\nSo here, Love, here’s a free hug.\n\nThis digital collage is titled Good Trouble, a phrase often used by John Lewis to describe nonviolent activism. Lewis was an American politician and civil rights activist who devoted his life to racial justice and equality. Good Trouble represents progress. It reminds us of how far we’ve come and how far we still have to go. Like many John Lewis quotes, Good Trouble is intended to empower people to use their voices and stand up against all injustice. I hope this artwork will encourage conversation, enlighten, and influence positive social change.\n\nEvery single person in this world has a heart; and we feel connection and love through our hearts. As we try to understand each other, our small pieces of relationships are put together, creating a whole art piece. I’ve always thought that to understand and embrace our differences, we need our hearts to see and feel the other’s heart. My artwork depicts the moment of connecting people worldwide by putting their hearts together while having smiles on their faces.\n\nMy artwork showcases interesting, expressive subjects to evoke strong emotional connections. Equity for All includes collaged cheesecloth with paper strip wordplay for hair, cheesecloth garments and a tote bag made from applied, painted canvas, with a hand painted Equity for All button. This painting is a portrait of a real person. He epitomizes the next generation of talented and skillful problem solvers with big dreams for a better America. A country that stands for freedom must provide true equity to all people. We need leaders to help create broad based solutions to the polarizing divides in our country and lead us toward building a more just and civil society. Only with such changes will we achieve the promise of real HOPE.\n\nAlmost all immigrants have their dreams cut short; they can’t do what others are able to do, because they are not citizens. Many were brought to America against their will; my mom is an example of that. Her parents brought her here at the age of 10, and she’s still in the process of becoming a legal US citizen. She could have been a lawyer, a nurse, a teacher, or have gone to college and been able to get a job, but she couldn’t. Coming to America, in a sense, clipped her wings and many others’. It feels like the government often turns a blind eye to those wingless souls, leaving them in the darkness and letting them watch their dreams die. I made this art piece is to show the suffering and cruelty of this process. Isn’t America supposed to be the land of freedom? The land where hopes and dreams are accomplished?\n\nIn this artwork, I created stereotypes. One of the people I drew is a female firefighter. Some people might say that this job is not feminine. Another person is a male makeup artist. People will say that it is not a common job for a male. Being different is nothing to be afraid of, stand out and show them who you are!\n\nIn this collaborative artwork, we wanted to portray the idea that all the things that make us different should be celebrated because our uniqueness makes the world a more colorful place. The students represented this idea as crayons, but instead of making their characters one solid color, they reflected their uniqueness with a variety of colors, facial features, and design elements. While we were positioning the crayons on the poster, the students joined the crayons together so that they were holding hands.\n\nA Conflict of Interests seeks to present the multifaceted identities we hold as mothers, and the diversity of the mothering experience. Through deconstructing the word “mother” itself to present the inner words ‘other’ ‘her’ and ‘me’ it speaks of collective maternal identity and the need to listen to mothers’ voices. Mothering is a verb, and each of us has the capacity to mother: ourselves, those we care for, our communities and our earth. Only through mothering, can we mend fractured communities and relationships, heal ourselves and repair our world.\n\nAs a woman who loves to dream and create—I believe it is important to remind my inner girl that it is okay to have big dreams. When I was younger I definitely had big dreams but they weren’t necessarily encouraged or fostered in the ways that I needed them to grow to where I am now. Overcoming some of those fears that were instilled in me has allowed me to nurture my inner girl. Furthermore, when I was a young girl and teen, I knew that there were differences in the world and that not everyone was as fortunate as I was. BUT it was not until adulthood that I learned how not all girls around the world got to go to school or have the same kinds of opportunities that I had. So much happiness in my childhood came from school and learning or achieving. To think that not every girl is afforded that same opportunity all around the world, in 2024, is beyond me. I hope for this piece of art to raise awareness and spark conversations with young people who will grow up and want to see better for young girls all around the world because when young girls everywhere are afforded an education—we all benefit.\n\nIf only we could have a world wide “Peace Party”! I see the world taking time off from war, bigotry, greed, and territorialism. People would be toasting to a new partnership that calls for peace and understanding. I believe it can be done through curiosity, love and an open heart. My hope and joy is that I might be a positive influence through my art.\n\nThis artwork is mixed media: Collage & acrylic paint.\n\nAs a black female artist, my photography confronts the premature adultification of young black girls in America. Through the intimate lens of black and white imagery, I spotlight their complex emotional journeys, often marred by societal demands to mature too soon. This portrait captures the silent resilience and the forced maturity they carry, juxtaposed with the innocence that should have been their right.\n\nThe stark contrasts in my work are deliberate, symbolizing the emotional landscapes these girls traverse—rich with unspoken stories, yet shadowed by experiences that age them beyond their years. My art advocates for their right to emotion, to the vulnerability and joy of youth, insisting on visibility and empathy for their struggles.\n\nIn presenting this narrative, I aim to empower and validate the emotional truths of these young individuals, challenging the viewer to honor their childhood and to confront the biases that rob them of it. My camera is my tool for change, demanding a reimagined future where their lives are fiercely protected and celebrated.\n\nSpirit of our Ancestors is a homage to a lineage unknown, envisioned by me, a Black woman artist longing for connection to my roots. The canvas presents imagined ancestors, each a testament to resilience and dignity, symbolizing the rich diversity of my heritage. Their varied expressions and hues articulate our shared humanity and the complex weave of individual and collective histories.\n\nThe faces, portraying a blend of strength and gentility, wisdom and curiosity, represent both a forgotten lineage and the relentless spirit that survives in their descendants. They invite viewers to ponder our lineage perspective on our contemporary lives, our challenges, and our triumphs in the pursuit of equality and recognition.\n\nThis artwork is a dialogue across time, urging reflection on personal heritage and the wider human saga. It’s an interweaving of historical imagination with current introspection, aimed to empower and deepen our sense of community and self-awareness.\n\nMy art celebrates the unique beauty of black features, focusing on eyes, noses, and lips to forge a deep, intimate connection with the viewer. Utilizing a vibrant palette, I aim to mirror the emotions of my subjects, transcending mere aesthetic appeal. While none of my portraits are self-portraits, each piece resonates with fragments of my identity, acting as mirrors to reflect and engage the viewer’s own sense of self.\n\nThis painting is more than just a image; it represents the diverse emotional spectrum of black women, challenging the monolithic stereotype often imposed upon us. This portrait, with its subtle nuances, speaks to the individuality and spirit of black women. Historically marginalized, our beauty and features have been overlooked or ridiculed. My work seeks to rewrite this narrative, to honor and celebrate our inherent beauty and strength. It’s a visual testament to our diversity, dignity, and the profound depth of our experiences.\n\nThe Fantastic Afronauts are on a poetic mission to find friends and work on their gardening skills while sailing through space. The Fantastic Afronauts learn lessons about bullying and friendship, horticulture and equality. I was inspired by Afropunk and Cyberpunk art styles, past current events that revolved around space travel. I want to represent people like myself who aren’t necessarily shown in specific arenas like “space/space travel.” The Afronauts are a representation of possibilities and inspiration for black and brown children.\n\nIf only we all could learn to see the positives within ourselves? This artwork represents the personal inner turmoil I go through within myself. I deal with depression, high anxiety, self doubt, an eating disorder and Dyslexia daily. It was a hard journey, but rewarding to go through this experience.While the positive words are plentiful and always represented in the art itself, they are not as easy to read as the negative words are and definitely not if you were to recall in real life. The negative words are well defined in bright white. They are easily chanted through my head, often making them seem true. The use of the yarn and zipper ties the whole thing together while allowing them to be separate at the same time.\n\nThis piece is 1 of 13 pieces for the 3/5th Series Exhibition Set to open Feb. 2025. This is a moment we can see a Black man adoring his daughter as she adores him.\n\nThe 3/5th Series is a series of moments captured to show people of color still written and amended in our constitution for all to see.\n\nThank you sister Bee! You really are sent from the ancestors. UBUNTU\n\nMy composition was inspired by how social status affects people in the world. I wanted to show people scared and trying to get somewhere but they can’t because others were preventing them from getting to the top. I chose the words “empowerment” and “enslavement” to help people understand what I’m trying to bring to the light, that some people are trying to overpower other people and keep them enslaved in the shadows. I chose to include stairs to show that some people are viewed and treated better than other people, so I showed the person at the top having a crown and being brighter than everyone else who was in the dark. I also showed that people in a higher position have younger ones being trained to step up into that high position. I used color to represent the highs and lows of society, the brighter people are higher up in in society status than the people in the dark. There are a some people creeping out of the shadows, trying to get to the top. Those in the shadows usually aren’t able to show off their skills, or gain many accomplishments at all.\n\nWe live in a world with many different types of people. Many times people are unkind to each other. We as young children want to help create a more peaceful place for the future. We want to learn and teach others to help make our world a more peaceful place. We can start one by one by being kind, being understanding speaking up for others, including others and paving a more peaceful path for others as well as ourselves. We are young, but we are strong!! We together can make a difference!\n\nThis is a painting of two cats cuddling each other in front of the rainbow flag. I really focused on making the drawing look more realistic than my other drawings and painting the background. I sketched it with a pencil and then watercolor painted it on mixed media paper. This art is supposed to have a warm and accepting feeling, to spread positive vibes, and what is a better way than to do it with cats?\n\nThird Grader Nevaeh Townsend said, “At school we mostly learn to get along, play and work out our differences. My classroom is like one big family. Most of the time we are happy to work together regardless of our differences.”\n\nSavannah Wares-Pickens said, “Many students come from different cultural backgrounds which can be hard when you are learning a new language too. Our teachers and Principal are stand-ins for our parents during the school day. Our school even has Reading Specialists, and Grandmas that work with us, as well as college students to help us in two or three of our lessons.”\n\nThird grader Shamari Brown said, “The world would be boring if we were all exactly the same.”\n\nThird grade students in Ms. Bowle’s class created this collaborative art project. As an art teacher, I’ve been inspired by Michelle Obama’s book, The Light We Carry.The themes of reaching for the light and being the light resonate with me. My art students traced their hand and arm dividing the shape into various sections. We used colored pencils to color in those shapes. The colors represent the many different people we have in our lives. The hands radiate out from a center circle, symbolizing the importance of reaching for the light. What is that light? It’s an attitude, a look, a smile, it’s anything that lifts another person.\n\nI think there are so many things we take for granted and consider ordinary in our lives. If we look past what we see at first glance, there are so many people who can contribute to our communities. Our cities are as progressive and unique as they are because we include people from diverse backgrounds. The more we invite people with different faiths, mindsets and stories to grow and thrive here, the more we can open our eyes to how beautiful the places we live in can be.\n\n“Me” is a representation of how I feel about my religion, and what it’s like sometimes when I reveal my true feelings and thoughts in a public space, like school. It shows a snake about to strike at a mouse, and the mouse is wearing a yamaka and the Star of David.\n\nI see the elements of value and contrast most distinctly in my work with the black-and-white theme. I made this piece with charcoal and colored pencil. I shaded them with charcoal before using a fine-tipped eraser to add highlights. To me, this piece is about my reality, how I live my life, and what I fear. It’s not just my religion, but sometimes my sexuality and race. The thing is, it’s not just me. It’s everyone. Everyone feels that way sometimes, and this piece is meant to showcase that.\n\nI think that I wanted this piece to help me express all my feelings through my art, instead of just the beautiful ones, and I think that I’ve made progress on that goal, but there is still more to come. One thing I noticed while making this piece was that it evolved from the original idea more than many of my other pieces, and that might be because it symbolized more than some of my other art.\n\nMentorship can be the one thing that helps a child grow to reach his full potential. In this piece, the viewer can see the growth of the boy as he goes from a child drawing to an adult that designs buildings. It shouldn’t matter what a child’s background, race, or lack of parental figures is; every child should be able to succeed and become a mentor themselves one day.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Elementary\n\nStandards: ELA.K-5.3.V.1.1, ELA.K-5.V.1.3\n\nSEL Component: Self-Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How can we make our dreams become our reality?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\nI made this piece to share my personal experience with violating, unwanted advances and coming to terms with it. This piece is meant to show one of the most common reactions to this kind of advance, which is to freeze in place. This happens to many individuals of all races, genders, sexes, ages, and orientations. This happens because they are panicked. Because they are scared. Because they are shocked. I have been put into situations like this before, and likely will be put into the same types of situations again in the future. This statement is for those who are out there and feel as if they have been overlooked. I want to let you know I see you, and there are others who will too.\n\nSelf-love is accepting ourselves just as we are. Women have been judged for not complying with the stereotypes of the “perfect body,” and it hasn’t been easy to love each other just as we are. I want to communicate loving ourselves and loving others. I used the Clip Studio Paint program and a Wacom Intuos Draw Small graphic tablet to do my work. All hearts represent our ways of loving, either ourselves or others.\n\nMental illness and depression education is something that was rarely talked about in school until more and more classrooms began SEL (Social Emotional Learning) lessons. By helping us take care of our mental health, there is acceptance when someone tells you that they are really struggling and can’t move forward. Because I am also neurodiverse, I struggle with the ability to express what is wrong. I wanted to make an artwork that portrayed my depressive episodes and mundane cycle day-by-day that felt like a broken record. Thanks to understanding by my friends, teachers, and family I now can break free of this depressive cycle and maybe one day pull someone else out of their repetitive cycle.\n\nThis piece depicts an androgynous silhouette of an LGBTQ+ person that is smiling, happy, and has the light and rays of different LGBTQ+ flags coming from the silhouette. I wanted to show that many LGBTQ+ people can be very happy and loving. This topic is meaningful to me because my family has multiple members of the LGBTQ+ community and depicting the community in a positive light is important to me.\n\nMy piece represents racial, social, gender, and disability inclusion. Everyone in our world is different in their own way and come from different backgrounds. Regardless of these differences, we all have the power to come together as one and embrace them. There are four different kinds of shoes shown in my photo, each representing a different “walk of life.” The way the shoes are framed symbolizes four people of different backgrounds: the sneaker of a teen, the dress shoe of a businessman, the work boot of a disabled man with a prosthetic, and the high heel of a woman. If we could put ourselves in other’s shoes and take into consideration that we are all going through different things and come from different places, we could spread more love and beauty in our world.\n\nMy drawing depicts the decrease in the number of people who help others just to show kindness, love, and compassion with no thought of getting something in return. A lot of people only perform charity work now to be seen as compassionate to others through means like social media. Outside the hourglass, with lightness to darkness, it shows that humanity is going from light and friendly days to dark and selfish times. The flowing sand shows the lessening of the number of people who help with pure intentions. I believe that through this drawing I tried to put on paper what many people don’t notice. Nowadays people just want to be kind to show off on social media which is really upsetting to me. Let’s stop this and show some real kindness with love and compassion.\n\nI believe that we should not discriminate against people for things that identify them and traits that they were born with including skin color, disability, upbringing, body size, parents, etc. I personally have experience with being bullied for not being academically smart and it pushed me to draw this art. The figures on the right side bully the children on the left that portray all the traits I listed above. The lighting on the outcast children is a symbol that there is hope for them; they are in a place of joy with the colorful graffiti that stands for what they believe. We are all born equal, so why do we discriminate against each other? Their faces hold the emotions commonly felt by people who are discriminated against. I used a combination of Procreate and wit to get to the end of this long and personal art.\n\nDuring my upbringing, I was instilled with ancestral knowledge and veneration of the land by my paternal grandmother who held the important role of cultural director in her community. In contrast, my maternal grandfather taught me the teachings of the Christian church which helped forge my integrity and spiritual strength. Both perspectives have been vital to the way I perceive the world and have allowed me to deeply connect with nature and human emotion. My works are inspired by traditional Native American teachings infused with the aesthetic of the Chicano neighborhoods of North Phoenix. I am deeply drawn to the aesthetic of tattoo art which is often placed playfully in my designs. The geometric rug designs alongside the Arizona flag colors and cityscapes are telling of my experience growing up in both Phoenix and the Navajo Reservation.\n\nJust like plants, we grow as a person depending on what we feed ourselves. If we continually live in the negativity of hate, jealousy, and resentment then we will fail to bloom as a person. By feeding ourselves positive attributes we can grow and help others as well. For this piece I was inspired by my own little home garden, and what it needed to be healthy. If we continue to build each other up, we can create a healthy and thriving community. For this digital piece I used Procreate with a mix of inking and watercolor brushes.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Elementary\n\nStandards: ELA.K-5.3.V.1.1, ELA.K-5.V.1.3\n\nSEL Component: Building Relationships\n\nEssential Question – How can we make others feel included and happy?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nGrade Level: Middle\n\nStandards: VA.68.S.1, ELA.6.R.1.4, ELA.7.R.1.4, ELA.8.R.1.4\n\nSEL Component: Self-Management\n\nEssential Question – What is inclusion and how are gratefulness and perseverance essential to self-management?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\n“UnSeen” was inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred during the summer of 2020. It was during this time that I began to understand the power of using my artwork to express my own voice. In this drawing, the eyes are covered to represent how people of color are not seen for who they truly are. Instead, they are only seen for what’s on the outside: the color of their skin. As a result, numerous degrading epithets are ascribed to people of color, and they are continuously facing unjust discrimination and acts of hatred. My visual art serves to highlight a singular aspect of how diverse populations and communities are steadily overlooked and are constantly refused the respect that they deserve.\n\nThis piece was done to bring awareness to the stereotypes surrounding Black men in America. It is my goal to evoke change for the young men and women of color in America so that one day they will have a fair opportunity in the United States.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: High\n\nTexts Utilized – AMERICA (Claude McKay – 1921), I HEAR AMERICA SINGING (Walt Whitman – 1855)\n\nStandard: LAFS.910.RL.2.4\n\nSEL Component: Social-Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How can social awareness help us understand how individuals experience the world?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\nAs soon as we are born, we are given a name, a religion, a nationality, and a race. The problem is that many people spend the rest of their lives defending a fictional identity that creates all kind of conflicts. With that comes competition for ascendancy in world trade, power, or military that may simply be empty and destructive on every level. The more we educate ourselves through art and learn about other cultures and traditions, the more we’ll be enriched, which will help us to rise above the religious dogmas, political ideologies and national allegiances that bitterly divide the world in the first place.\n\n“A Mile in My Shoes” showcases six individuals from different walks of life. My piece illustrates the idea that immersing yourself in others’ lives, rather than judging them, is vital to moving forward. I believe walking in the shoes of others allows you to gain empathy and perspective – enriching your own life through understanding the diversity around you.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Middle\n\nStandards: VA.68.S.1.1,ELA.6.V.1.1, ELA.7.V.1.1, ELA.8.C.5.1SEL Component: Social-Awareness\n\nEssential Question – What is Diversity? Why are diversity and unity important in a community of individuals?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\nIn these strange times that we are experiencing, children are exposed to the worst of our society. The internet, videos, television, and printed media put forth material where the concepts of character, honesty and compassion are nowhere to be found. As an illustrator I have had the great privilege to create art for the wonderful Bucket Filler books by Carol McCloud. In working with Carol, I have had the opportunity to experience her love of children, creative sincerity, and strength of character. Her books are all about building character and kindness in children. In my illustrations I aspire to support visually the importance of Carol’s concepts utilizing bright color and interesting faces with visuals that are fun and humorous. I render the artwork in watercolor and enhance detail and texture using colored pencil.\n\nWords that are spoken repeatedly never seem to go away. This image reflects the pressure on us to be perfect and shows people altering what doesn’t need to be changed, all for the recognition and validation of others. The hands are all the same, and they are molding us into an ideal picture. The camera lens is focused on us, not letting us breathe, not letting us rest for a minute. The pressure on us is unbearable. Hopefully, it will dissipate over time. Different isn’t ugly and accepting it should be a necessity. Being able to work on a piece that encourages individuality and paints a picture of all the things that I went through is freeing. People used to demand that I “do this, not that.” I don’t want to play it safe. I want to be me, do it my way, fail, get back on my feet, and learn from my mistakes.\n\nI believe that diversity and inclusion means being able to appreciate other cultures and lifestyles. It means sharing a piece of your life in hopes of enriching another’s. I decided to incorporate food, an artwork that is often used to distinguish one region from others, into my work. To display inclusion, I wanted to portray each person indulging in a meal from the other’s culture, to respect and learn from one another. I spent some time researching special dishes that are prominent in each culture, such as the Okonomiyaki in Japan and Koeksisters in South Africa. When I started painting, I mostly focused on the use of contrast throughout this piece, which is why I used a black and white background and a colorful, vibrant foreground.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Elementary\n\nStandards: ELA.K-5.3.V.1.1, ELA.K-5.V.1.3, ELA.K-5.C.1.2\n\nSEL Component: Social Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How can we celebrate how we are alike and different?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\nThrough the years, I have learned to cope with many situations by plastering my observations and opinions on a canvas, associating certain colors to material and spiritual things. As a Hispanic, homosexual male, I have witnessed a great deal of discrimination from a variety of sources. I have seen violence and division created by hate and ignorance. This artwork reflects how I perceived America on June 12, 2016 – when 49 members of the LGBTQA+ community were killed inside the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, FL. This simplistic depiction on the surface masks a deep state of fear, despair, helplessness, confusion, and anger against those who want to hurt those who are considered different in their eyes. The color red carries the meaning of blood and life. It’s used in a literal matter. The colors of the Pride flag take over the red, white, and blue of the American flag, and the stars become unfortunate victims of this unnecessary tragedy.\n\nAs a Brazilian, immigrant artist I understand, first-hand, that diversity and inclusion are not only important but urgent. We are all different people with unique lived experiences coexisting in the same place. I believe that our unifying principal and the flag we should raise is that of love and respect. My art depicts a diverse group of people from difference ethnicities, races, gender, and body types coming together as one. Their diversity makes their community stronger.\n\nThere is a Greek saying, “don’t judge so that you won’t be judged.” People go on criticizing each other all the time, but what we really should be doing is opening our minds. Diversity isn’t something that breaks a society apart. It keeps it together. There is no shame in being yourself. We are beautiful. We are different. We are unique. But most importantly, we are all equals. With this art piece I try to highlight this message and show that all people, regardless of their origin, gender, color, or characteristics must have equal opportunities and rights. If this is implemented, we will be able to cooperate and, through the different ideas and views, grow as a society. It starts with a step forward. Let’s take it.\n\nThe negative emotions that we carry around keep us from being our happiest and showing our true talents. In this piece, the bag represents all the emotions that weigh us down. Anger, Envy, Jealously, Fear, Greed, Sorrow, and many others. The Bluebird is often used as a symbol of happiness and joy. And the snow shows how if we hang onto our emotional baggage, we are left in a cold and miserable existence.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: High\n\nTexts Utilized – ‘I AM NOT AN INMATE ..’ (Deena Prichep – 2014), EXCERPT FROM A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN (James Joyce – 1916)\n\nStandard: LAFS.910.RL.1.2SEL Component: Self-Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How do the struggles individuals face encourage them to look inward?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist\n\nArt comprises a multitude of styles and appearances.

The work is part of a stitched fabric series called the “Lady Corona Comforter Series” that I began during the pandemic. Lady Corona is meant to be a figure who offers comfort. Lady Corona (right) joins two couples, among the many constituencies whose lives were impacted by Ginsburg and among thousands who came out to pay respects after her passing. I am Professor Emeritus of African American Studies and Art History at Western Illinois University, and author of The Black Arts Movement and the Black Panther Party in American Visual Culture (Routledge, 2019).\n\nAll the smiling faces of people are the same. The eyes are elongated to the side, the sparkling light stays in the pupils, the mouth is wide open from side to side, and the muscles around the mouth are pulled upwards. Regardless of race, gender, age, religion, skin color, or hair color, people’s smiles are all the same. And the appearance of smiling people always makes those who see it happy. By acknowledging and embracing differences, people are respected, comfortable, and able to laugh out loud. And it is a way for me to be respected, happy, and smile also.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Elementary\n\nStandards: ELA.K-5.3.V.1.1, ELA.K-5.V.1.3, ELA.K-5.C.1.2\n\nSEL Component: Social Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How can we celebrate how we are alike and different?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nPhotography allows me to tell facts which can be a story, a moment, or a state of mind, believing that it is an honest, spontaneous way to generate social awareness. Inspirations come from the reality of everyday life through observing others, or oneself, using intuition as a tool. This photograph represents a lot to me; it was taken on a weekend at my grandmother’s house. Her hands, over 90 years old and calloused from working at a young age in farming when she immigrated from Japan to Brazil, meet the little hands of my niece, the youngest of the family. The new generation still struggles with similar issues as the previous generations but gives us hope for a better future.\n\nMy artwork navigates, through colorful visual storytelling pertaining to the modern American way of life, our relationships with the environment and nature and what it means to live in healthy communities. Often these themes are combined into multi-media endeavors that incorporate mundane domestic objects done with whimsical touch and humor. This piece focuses on the differences between the younger generation, which represents a new world and a new way of thinking, and the older generation which represents an older thinking. The artwork depicts how the two find a common language to communicate with each other and bridge the differences in a positive and constructive manner. I hope it will invoke a conversation which will inspire others to explore how we bridge the gap between our different world views.\n\nMy artwork symbolizes the sense of loneliness that people may often feel, especially during the pandemic. The cool color background highlights a feeling of misery and sorrow as blue and green are often associated with sadness and tears. The only warm colors in my artwork are on the girl. This contrast between warm vs. cool draws attention to the idea that anyone, even if you feel alone, emanates brightness and energy, and that everyone is valued and loved.\n\nLesson Plan Connection\n\nGrade Level: Middle\n\nStandards: VA.68.S.1, ELA.6.R.1.4, ELA.7.R.1.4, ELA.8.R.1.4\n\nSEL Component: Self-Management\n\nEssential Question – What is inclusion and how are gratefulness and perseverance essential to self-management?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nGrade Level: High\n\nTexts Utilized – ‘I AM NOT AN INMATE ..’ (Deena Prichep – 2014), EXCERPT FROM A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN (James Joyce – 1916)\n\nStandard: LAFS.910.RL.1.2SEL Component: Self-Awareness\n\nEssential Question – How do the struggles individuals face encourage them to look inward?\n\nLesson Plan | PowerPoint\n\nMeet the Artist"
