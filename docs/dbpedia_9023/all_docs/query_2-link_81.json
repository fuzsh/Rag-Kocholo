        "text": "After speculation regarding the alleged death of Blaque‘s Natina Reed went rampant on the Internet, fellow girl group member Shamari (Fears) DeVoe took to Twitter Saturday (Oct. 27) to confirm the news.\n\nOur condolences go out to Natina’s family and the members of Blaque.\n\nAs reported earlier:\n\nThe Atlanta music community is expressing their condolences after unconfirmed reports say that Natina Reed, the spunky spitter of girl group Blaque, has passed away.\n\nThe 32-year-old female rapper was said to be involved in a hit-and-run accident late Friday night (Oct. 26) in Atlanta. Songwriter/producer Isaac Hayes III was one of the first to tweet the news, posting “R.I.P. Natina Reed of the Group Blaque. Killed by a Hit & Run last night. So sad.”\n\nReed was a protegee of TLC’s Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, whose tragic death was at the hands of a car accident in 2002. Left Eye championed the pop/R&B trio, known for their hits “808” and “Bring It All To Me,” even signing them to her production company, Left Eye Productions. Natina is also remembered for her role in the 2000 cheerleader chick flick Bring It On alongside Gabrielle Union, who tweeted, “#RIP #Sad #BringItOn.”\n\nReed is survived by her 10-year-old son Tren Brown from her relationship with rapper Kurupt. Tomorrow (Oct. 27) would have marked her 33rd birthday"
