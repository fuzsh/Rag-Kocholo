        "text": "What is Ronnie Devoe's Net Worth?\n\nRonnie Devoe is an American R&B/soul singer who has a net worth of $3 million. Ronnie Devoe earned his net worth and fame as a member of the popular R&B groups New Edition and Bell Biv Devoe. Ronnie owes his music career to his uncle, New Edition choreographer Brook Paine, who brought him into the band. New Edition caught the attention of record producer Maurice Starr after they came second in a singing competition in 1982. The group was quickly signed to Maurice's Streetwise record label. New Edition eventually would become one of the most successful R&B acts of the 1980s. After New Edition broke up in 1990, Ronnie and fellow New Edition alums Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins formed a new R&B act called Bell Biv Devoe. This group went on to become one of the biggest R&B acts of the 1990s."
