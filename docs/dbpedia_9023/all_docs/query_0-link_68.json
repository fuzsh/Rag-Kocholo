        "text": "Nivea B. Hamilton (born March 24, 1982), better known by her mononym Nivea, is an American R&B singer whose recordings reached the Billboard charts during the early 2000s. Nivea is known most for her Grammy-nominated hit \"Don't Mess with My Man\" as well as \"Laundromat\" and \"Okay\" featuring YoungbloodZ & Lil' Jon. She has released three studio albums: Nivea (2001), Complicated (2005), Animalistic (2006), and an independently released extended play Nivea: Undercover (2011). In 2019, she released her album Mirrors, including the single \"Circles\".\n\nEarly life\n\nNivea was born in Savannah, Georgia, the youngest of three sisters. She sang in a church choir and admired the music of Mariah Carey. Nivea admitted to being shy in a BET \"Finding Nivea\" interview. She said, \"I never wanted anyone to hear me sing... my parents would turn down the radio [and I would automatically stop].\"\n\nCareer\n\n2000–2003: Nivea\n\nMain article: Nivea (album)\n\nIn 2000, Nivea appeared on Mystikal's hit single \"Danger (Been So Long)\" which garnered her some buzz. Following the success of it, she had signed with Jive Records and released her debut solo single \"Don't Mess with the Radio \" in 2001 which garnered moderate success, peaking at No. 90 on the Hot 100 and No. 85 on R&B. Her label then decided to focus on her internationally, releasing her self-titled debut album in Australia and Japan first. On September 25, 2001, the album was released in United States peaking at No. 80 on the Billboard 200 and No. 85 on R&B. \"Run Away (I Wanna Be with You)\" (featuring Pusha T) was released as the album's next single in Japan in December 2001.\n\nIn August 2002, she released her second U.S. single, \"Don't Mess with My Man\" featuring Brian and Brandon Casey (of R&B group Jagged Edge).

Ken Hamm of Soulbounce.com reviewed \"Virginia\" stating, \"Nivea’s plight shows us that maybe love just isn’t enough. Over sultry keys and guitar licks, Nivea sings about a man who makes her feel warm when the world feels so cold. However, this love thang is a situationship, not a relationship; she’s wifey, but not the wife\" while amethystmusicnewsmagazine.com wrote \"R&B veteran/singer/songwriter Nivea is back with a new single entitled, 'Virginia.' On the track, the singer displays the beautiful vocals that she’s known for singing.\"\n\nIn mid October she confirmed that she will be joining fellow R&B singer Paula DeAnda for their long awaited collaboration, both Singers have confirmed this on separate interviews in 2020 that they have stayed in contact and plan to have the single set for 2022.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn February 2002, Nivea started dating rapper Lil Wayne. On December 11, 2002, they became engaged. In her July 2003 interview with Sister to Sister magazine, Nivea spoke about her engagement and how Wayne proposed. \"Wayne said, 'I got your Christmas present with me and you're gonna love it. It's gonna make you smile. He got down on his knee and he was like, 'I know I'm young, but I've been through enough relationships to know and understand the meaning of what love is.' He was just perfect. He told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and he loved me. It was snot and tears at the same time.\" She also spoke on her wishes to have a son with the rapper. \"I want a little boy very much right now. Wayne's daughter is just wonderful. She's a beautiful little girl.\" In an 2021 interview with Kandi Burruss, Nivea revealed having suffered a miscarriage. Nivea credited Wayne as being her first love. She said that if they didn't get married, that she would die a single woman. In August 2003, Lil Wayne called off their engagement. Wayne's song \"Something You Forgot\" was about his relationship with Nivea.\n\nNivea married R&B singer and producer Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash in December 2004. Their daughter was born on May 10, 2005, and their twin sons in April 2006. The-Dream filed for legal separation on December 10, 2007. On June 15, 2008, their divorce was finalized. Nash stated in an interview, \"I decided to end it because I didn't want to take this person [Nivea] and treat them a certain way based on what I was changing into, based on being bitter.\" However, Nivea says The-Dream wanted the divorce, not she. \"I'm lying, it's not. We're supposed to say that, but it's not true. It wasn't no mutual agreement, he wanted to do it, I didn't, but it's done. I'm dealing with it.\" The-Dream wrote much of his album Love/Hate based on his relationship with Nivea. He credited her with inspiring more sincerity in his songwriting, \"to open up that other side of it that connects with the everyday woman\", as he told SOHH. \"She has helped me a lot with that area.\"\n\nAfter her divorce in 2007, Nivea reconciled with her ex-fiancé, rapper Lil Wayne. On June 9, 2009, it was rumored that Nivea and Lil Wayne were engaged and expecting a child together. On October 14, 2009, Lil Wayne confirmed that he and Nivea were expecting a son. Nivea gave birth to their son on November 30, 2009. In June 2010, Nivea and Lil Wayne broke off their engagement for the second time.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Nivea discography\n\nNivea (2001)\n\nComplicated (2005)\n\nAnimalistic (2006)\n\nMirrors (2019)\n\nFilmography"
