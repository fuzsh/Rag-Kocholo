        "text": "ON THIS DAY IN 1842, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported, “The birthday of Washington is to be celebrated in true Temperance style today, in this and the adjacent cities. A grand military ball takes place at the Bowery, where tableau vivants illustrative of prominent incidents in the hero’s career will be displayed, and where the lovers of the dance will doubtless assemble. But the most interesting feature will be the great supper, or tea and cold water party at the Centre Market Hall. Three thousand tickets to this fete have already been disposed of, and yesterday were in demand at a premium. For once, we trust, this great era in the history of our country will be appropriately appreciated.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1861, the Eagle reported, “PHILADELPHIA — The celebration of Washington’s birthday began at daylight by salutes being fired off in different parts of the city … The ceremony of raising the flag of 34 stars over the Hall of Independence this morning, by Mr. Lincoln, was attended with all the solemnity due such an occasion, the scene being an impressive one. At the rising of the sun, crowds of people streamed from all parts of the city towards the State House, and very soon every inch of ground was occupied, a vast number of ladies being present. The weather was cool and bracing. At 7 o’clock, Mr. Lincoln was escorted to the Hall, and there received by [Rev.] Theodore Cuyler, who warmly welcomed him to its venerable walls in the hour of national peril and distress, when the great work achieved by the wisdom and patriotism of our fathers seemed threatened with instant ruin.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1882, the Eagle reported, “Among the anniversaries which are being more generally observed in this country with every year of the nation’s life is that which closes the stores and offices today in commemoration of the typical American patriot who was first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen. The birthday of George Washington is in any aspect one may choose an event to be celebrated, and that it should be regarded with constantly increasing interest is entirely meet and right … Washington’s birthday is not yet so general a holiday as it ought to be, but before many years have passed it will be as fully observed as the Fourth of July or Christmas.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1916, the Eagle reported, “The Colonial dance of the Entre Nous Club, held last night in the clubhouse, 489 Bedford Avenue, in celebration of Washington’s birthday, was one of the artistic and social successes of the season in the Eastern District. It was a costume dance, the young women appearing in gowns designed on the lines of the garb of Colonial belles. The decorations of the club were in harmony with the general scheme. The evening began with a reception, following which there was a promenade concert by a string orchestra. After the grand march, the dancing was begun and many of the younger set had their first taste of the cotillions and square dances of the old Revolutionary days. The effect was remarkable and was generally conceded to be one of the most strikingly original dances of the year.”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1932, the Eagle reported, “WASHINGTON (A.P.) — Standing before the Congress of the United States, President Hoover marked today the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birth, by pronouncing him the chief contributor to the nation’s greatness. ‘The true eulogy of Washington,’ he said, ‘is this mighty nation.’ The chief executive’s words — delivered before a joint session of the Senate and House — initiated formally the bicentennial celebration of the first president’s birth, which will extend over the next nine months … ‘From the room where I conduct my high office, I hourly see the monument which Washington’s proud and grateful countrymen have raised to his memory. It stands foursquare to the world, its base rooted in the solid substance of American soil.’”\n\n***\n\nON THIS DAY IN 1954, the Eagle reported, “LONDON (U.P.) — This is Washington’s birthday. And so the guards in Madame Tussaud’s wax museum will keep an alert eye today on the effigy of President George Washington. It’s that way when you run a wax museum. Anyone who is a hero to some people is bound to be a villain to others. And somewhere there still may be a Briton or two who regard Washington as an impertinent, upstart Colonel. This was brought home again to Madame Tussaud’s last week when a man protesting alleged illiteracy in Britain broke the waxen head of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and damaged the figures of three of his Cabinet ministers with a hammer. Churchill gets a new head every five years, so today he glassily surveyed the crowds of the curious with the head used in 1948. His three Cabinet ministers, less durable in wax than the venerable statesman, had to be taken away for repairs. ‘We don’t often get violence like that,’ said Reginald Edds, an official of the wax works. ‘We get lots of letters and verbal complaints and a great deal of scowling and shaking of fists at figures like that of Stalin. But there are very few actual attacks on the effigies.’”\n\n***\n\nNOTABLE PEOPLE BORN ON THIS DAY include Basketball Hall of Famer Chet Walker, who was born in 1940; Basketball Hall of Famer Julius Erving, who was born in 1950; “Little Shop of Horrors” star Ellen Greene, who was born in Brooklyn in 1951; “Twin Peaks” star Kyle MacLachlan, who was born in 1959; Loudness guitarist Akira Takasaki, who was born in 1961; World Golf Hall of Famer Vijay Singh, who was born in 1963; former Knicks and Nets center Chris Dudley, who was born in 1965; Hockey Hall of Famer Pat LaFontaine, who was born in 1965; former “Saturday Night Live” star Rachel Dratch, who was born in 1966; “Picard” star Jeri Ryan, who was born in 1968; “The Mist” star Thomas Jane, who was born in 1969; “Aladdin” star Lea Salonga, who was born in 1971; International Tennis Hall of Famer Michael Chang, who was born in 1972; “Charlie’s Angels” star Drew Barrymore, who was born in 1975; Blaque singer Shamari DeVoe, who was born in 1980; former NBA point guard Rajon Rondo, who was born in 1986; and eight-time NFL Pro Bowler Khalil Mack, who was born in 1991.\n\n***\n\nSpecial thanks to “Chase’s Calendar of Events” and Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nQuotable:\n\n“If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.”\n\n— U.S. Founding Father George Washington, who was born on this day in 1732"
