        "meta_description": "Blessing audiences for more than 40 years, the Truthettes of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, are best known for their 1980s gospel hit Peanut Butter and Jelly.  A member of a traveling group called the Gospel Truths, Velma “Ms. Vee” Morgan of Holdenville, Oklahoma, organized the Truthettes in 1975 around her daughters Tiffanie (Tu-Tu) and Tamara, and Gayla Butler and Becky Perry, the offspring of other Gospel Truths members.  The Truthettes dazzled audiences with a mature sound that belied their youthfulness. Their first single was self-produced but it did well enough to earn them appearances on programs around the southwestern United States. The late Willie Neal Johnson was so impressed with the young ladies that he took them on tour with him and introduced them to the late Frank Williams of Malaco Records.  Since the Truthettes were young and new to recording, Williams brought the group into the studio a week early so they could become comfortable with the experience. Their 1980 debut on Malaco, Child’s Prayer, offered the popular God Stood By My Side. The follow-up, He’s Still Working on Me (1982), yielded the up-tempo Can’t Nobody Do Me Like Jesus.  The Truthettes scored their biggest hit with their 1983 Malaco LP, Take It to the Lord in Prayer, which remained on Billboard’s Top Spiritual Albums chart for 81 weeks and featured the story song Peanut Butter and Jelly. Other Malaco albums that charted were Making a Way (1985), God Will Make Things Alright (1986), and Every Step of the Way (1987). The group also recorded Flowing for Malaco in 1989.  The Truthettes have traveled extensively throughout the United States and the world, including a performance at the Heineken Jazz Festival in Rotterdam, Holland. The group appeared on BET’s Bobby Jones Gospel many times and has received awards and presentations, including being named Gospel Legends at the 1999 Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA). The GMWA Quartet Division honored the Truthettes with its own Living Legend Award in 2012.  \n\n Follow Me: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheTonyHolley\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002351314338\nFacebook Fan Page:https://www.facebook.com/TheTonyHShow/\nInstagram:@TheTonyHolley   \nFollow @Tiffanie Tutu Agee Ministries  : \nInstagram:@TutuAgee \nFacebook: @Tiffanie Tutu Agee \nhttps://richgracebytutu.com",

        "text": "When you hear the name, The Three Degrees, you immediately think of their most famous song, \"When Will I See You Again\", and the vision of three beautiful ebony women, perfectly coordinated in both their dance routines and their vocal harmonies. True, \"When Will I See You Again\" was a major hit record throughout the world, topping the chart in the U.S.A., the U.K., Japan and most European countries, earning the trio every conceivable accolade at the time -- not to mention enough Gold records to make Fort Knox a little envious! More than four decades on, the threesome have retained all three of their major qualities -- their beauty, their sparkling choreography and their precise vocal qualities. And, in between, they have amassed an impressive list of hit records. The actual beginning of the group dates back more than 4 decades, when their then-manager, the enigmatic Richard Barrett brought three young teenagers together in Philadelphia. After a couple of years of constant rehearsing and local record hops, the group made its first mark on the recording scene by way of the Philly-based Swan Records. During the Swan years, the group's line up was Helen, Fayette Pinkney and Janet Harmon. Their biggest success on Swan was probably \"Gee Baby\", which featured Fayette on lead vocals. \"Those original recordings were quite different from the way we record now,\" Helen reflects. \"We would record with a 'live' band, all in one room at the same time. Only towards the end of the years with Swan did we record our vocals after the band had finished recording the tracks. Many of the musicians went on to become members of MFSB and I remember when Kenny Gamble would come by the office and the studio to tout his songs! Soon thereafter Helen got married and left the group. By this time, they had signed with New York-based Roulette Records and the line-up was Fayette, Valerie Holiday and Sheila Ferguson and this line-up was to remain intact for their glory years with Roulette and Philadelphia International. In 1972, they aligned their recording fate with Gamble and Huff's Philadelphia International label and hit immediate paydirt in 1972 with \"Dirty Ol’ Man\". Soon after came \"TSOP\", which featured the ladies with MFSB. The following year came 'When Will I See You Again\". \"The whole Philadelphia Sound was the brainchild of Kenny (Gamble) and Leon (Huff),\" Valerie explains. \"They wrote and produced most of the hits...Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, the O'Jays, Billy Paul, the Intruders. In all honesty, we weren't aware of the potential of the label when we first signed but at our first session with them, we felt the magic. It was different from anything we had ever experienced before. During their 3 year stint with Philadelphia International, they enjoyed a good measure of success with \"Year Of Decision\", \"Take Good Care Of Yourself\" and, again with MFSB, \"Love Is The Message\". In 2015, the threesome returned to the recording studios to record their tribute to the music of their home city. Entitled “Strategy: Our Tribute to Philadelphia”, the album features their unique rendition of some of the best known and most revered songs from the golden era of the city – such as “Love Train”, “Ain’t No Stoppin Us Now”, “If You Don’t Know Me By Now” as well as their slant on “Me & Mr. Jones”, “You’ll Never Find Another Love” and an update on their own “TSOP”. Fans of the threesome and the press have all offered their thumbs on the CD! So it is that after almost six decades of existence, the Three Degrees can still make the claim as being the longest running female vocal group in history....see the Guinness Book of Records for confirmation of this fact! And they show no signs of slowing down!

Blessed with a bold, powerful voice that has drawn comparisons to Whitney Houston, Kim Burrell, and Vanessa Bell Armstrong, the gospel singer's cadre of fans have come to know that the unique musical experience the New York native brings stems from her willingness to share a testimony of triumphs and struggles. ​ Raised the daughter of a preacher, Crawford spent much of her early life heavily involved in the church, serving as choir director, praise and worship leader, and lead vocalist for local ensembles. These experiences provided the perfect training ground for the vocal powerhouse to hone her signature sound and gripping delivery of God's message through gospel music. Crawford initially gained national notoriety during her breakout performances on Season 2 of BET's ‘Sunday Best’, where she achieved second runner-up. Following the TV series, she released her self-titled debut album in 2014, bringing the inspiring hit \"There\". ​ In 2016 Crawford released her sophomore project, Diary of A Church Girl. The critically acclaimed EP garnered Crawford her first Stellar Award nomination, a second Billboard charting album, and brought listeners a deep look into Crawford’s personal relationship with God through songs such as \"Author\" and “Choose Me\". Self-penned and nakedly autobiographical, the project resonates with authenticity in ways that transcend traditional gospel storylines. Crawford's connection with her audience and commitment to ministry extends well beyond music. As a contributor to the Huffington Post and Essence, she has written on a range of topics to include mental wellness, parenting, race relations, and self-care. Additionally, Crawford starred in the 15th anniversary run of the hit musical stage play Crowns. Audiences and critics lauded her portrayal of the character Velma as \"soul-stirring\" and \"transcendent\". She also recently launched her firm, Whole Life, and serves as an empowerment life coach, certified in Psychology, Achology, CBT, NLP and Emotional Intelligence. ​ Now, as a member of the eOne Nashville family, Crawford is promoting her new project, The Cure. The lead singles \"Amazing\" and \"Something Something\" provide a perfect preview into the message of hope the revered singer intends to bring. States Crawford, Crawford states, “In our life journey, we come to rely on so many different ‘medicines’ to satisfy our needs, wants, and search for meaning - relationships, money, success, and more. I’ve come to realize that these are temporary fixes that only soothe symptoms, but never address the underlying ailment. For people like me who want more, who want a cure, THE CURE, who is God - this project is for them. Comment who you would like to see me interview next.

This fabulous coffee-table book showcases the gowns The Supremes were known for over the decades and delves into more history of the most successful female recording group of all time. Supreme Glamour is now available wherever books are sold.\n\nIn 2019 Mary was honored at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills celebrating her work in music and her influence on young African-Americans and entertainment.\n\nDancing With The Stars proved to be an exciting opportunity for Ms. Wilson in 2019, where she showed America that she still had Cholly Atkins’ choreography down pat! A few of her fellow castmates included, Ally Brooke, Sailor Brinkley-Cooke, Karamo Brown & James Van Der Beek.\n\nIn 2020, NNPA Black Press USA presented Ms. Wilson with their Trailblazer Award to honor her life and career for their Black Music Appreciation Month celebration.\n\nMs. Wilson has worked behind the scenes for years on many legislative initiatives aimed at modernizing copyright laws to protect the artists whose rights were not being adequately protected. 2018 marked an important step forward for Mary’s fight to have the Music Modernization Act (MMA) pass. Her vision came to fruition when the United States legislation signed the act into law on October 11, 2018. The act aims to modernize copyright-related issues for new music and audio recordings due to new forms of technology like digital streaming which did not protect music recorded before February 15, 1972. Her advocacy for this act lies with herself and other legacy artists gaining fair compensation when their songs are played on digital radio stations.\n\nFollow Me: Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheTonyHolley\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002351314338\n\nFacebook Fan Page:https://www.facebook.com/TheTonyHShow/\n\nInstagram:@TheTonyHolley\n\nHer storybook beginning is magical in that CeCe Peniston spent most of her formative years in Phoenix, Arizona and got her first start singing before her congregation in church. She performed in plays and musicals and participated in talent shows while learning to play the piano. The real testament of her talent was in 1987 when CeCe, still a high school student, landed a part in a local production of Bubbling Brown Sugar. From their, she would earn her diploma and continue on to the University of Phoenix to study Liberal Arts. These years would serve as a springboard for CeCe to develop her skills in writing lyrics. In 1989, CeCe was crowned Miss Black Arizona and reigned as Miss Galaxy in 1990. In 1991, CeCe elevated as a true artist when a friend and Phoenix based record producer, Felipe “DJ Wax Dawg” Delgado, asked her to record back- up vocals for a female rapper slated to release an album on A&M Records. Soon after, Peniston showed her willingness to make her own individual mark in the business, and land her solo project commissioned by then A&M Records music executive, Manny Lehman. Peniston’s hit single known today as “Finally” was born and CeCe accomplished what all talented artists only dream of, inking a deal for her own debut album. The 1990s, proved to be substantial for the Dayton, Ohio native. She became an international sensation and was considered to be one of the most successful dance club artists in the history of the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Charts. Peniston was successful at scoring five major number one hits within three years. Her signature Dance hit “Finally” was #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart and #2 on the UK Top 75. It became one of the biggest dance records in history to sell over 3 million copies worldwide. Peniston set in motion a series of singles and videos, all of which had varying success. Many of her songs triggered a series of Billboard Awards nominations in several categories and gained acceptability and appeal from fans across many genres of music. On October 17, Billboard magazine announced that Peniston was the leading nominee in the Billboard Music Awards, being nominated in four categories: three times in the dance category with “Finally” (Best New Artist, Best Female Artist and Best Director), and one in the R&B/Rap category (Best Female Artist) for her urban hit “Keep On Walkin’”. Ultimately the song won two awards, and three of her singles released in 1992 would be listed within the Top 100 songs of the Billboard Year-End chart (at #20 with “Finally”, at #61 with “Keep On. By the end of 1992, Peniston received several awards for her achievements in the music industry. Among the awards were Best New Artist – Dance, three ASCAP Awards and Pop Songwriter of The Year. She received another three awards as Best New Dance Artist, Best Dance Solo Artist, and for Best 12” Dance Record at the Annual Winter Music Conference, as well as, the BMI Urban Award of Achievement. The album itself was nominated on a Soul Train Music Award ’93 in the Best R&B/Soul Album – Female category. By the end of 19993, Peniston was named No. 1 Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Artist. She has been active in making her mark in the social media craze. Now that she is more social media savvy, she has reached new heights in her career utilizing social media as a platform. She continues to strive to give her fans more by boosting her visibility utilizing YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook, with a fan base that has reached well over 100,000 people. Considering her presence on several TV shows over the years, CeCe has been asked by a number of television producers to star in a show of her own. CeCe’s commitment to showing fans the strong and sensitive side of herself and the care she brings to every situation can soon be viewed by a more broader audience.\n\nAndrea “DREA” Kelly is a well-known dancer, choreographer, entrepreneur, actress, motivational speaker, and reality TV star. She transformed her personal experiences of marital abuse and heartache into a relentless crusade of being “a voice for the voiceless.” Not allowing the power and fame of her abuser to stop her, she proudly promotes domestic violence awareness and shares her testimony through her advocacy and motivational speaking. But, long before she stunned the world with her story of bravery and resilience, she was gaining notoriety as a principal dancer and choreographer. ​ Born a dancer, DREA Kelly first rose to fame as a Brown ballerina from the Southside of Chicago, studying under the guidance of Joe Hall. She quickly grew her performance repertoire to be recognized as an award-winning celebrity choreographer, principal dancer, and actress. Her long list of choreographing for celebrities can be seen in music videos, award shows, and national and international tours. ​ During her low-profile marriage, a shadow was cast over her acting and dancing career. Though she welcomed family life, it was tainted with emotional, sexual, physical, and financial abuse. In a defining moment of courage, she left her abuser and remained silent about the abuse for several years. Since finding her voice, she spent years fighting and advocating for domestic violence awareness. Being a survivor of domestic violence, DREA Kelly turned her life story into a source of motivation and has been invited to speak on national and international platforms. From Anguilla to California Ms. Kelly has key noted for colleges, universities, women’s conferences, and rescue centers. She wears many hats. Not only has she returned to reality-TV in support of her oldest daughter, Buku Abi on We TV’s Growing Up Hip Hop- Atlanta, she is also making appearances in movies, leading master dance classes, hosting empowerment retreats, and pouring into her foundation, The 12th Round Foundation. Taking the “Rome was not built in a day” approach, she has been writing a self-help memoir, Under The Red Carpet, where she is expressing her passion for women’s empowerment, self-responsibility, and the evolution to becoming one’s greatest-self. DREA Kelly has quickly become a household favorite with her winning smile, dynamic personality, and profound quotables of survivorship and empowerment.\n\nFollow Me: Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheTonyHolley\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002351314338\n\nFacebook Fan Page:https://www.facebook.com/TheTonyHShow/\n\nInstagram:@TheTonyHolley\n\nFollow Drea:\n\nInstagram: @OfficialDreaKelly\n\nFacebook:Drea Kelly\n\nTwitter:@DreaKelly www.DreaKellyIs.com\n\n#AndreaKelly #DreaKelly #TheTonyHolleyShow\n\nMonique Nikkole was born and raised in Canarsie Brooklyn and started singing at the tender age of two. No matter where she was, she was singing. Monique would participate in local talent shows sporadically through her youth and also sang in school and church choirs. Monique took a hiatus from singing for a number of years because of the lack of support from her parents. Singing was viewed as a hobby not a career. Her father was also a singer and his experiences as a singer weren’t positive enough for him to allow his baby girl into the “lion’s den”. Her fathers’ negative experiences of being burned within the music industry casted a shadow on her dreams (which she is not bitter about). The arts weren’t fully supported within her family. Her parents felt education and finding secure employment was much more important. For this reason Monique Nikkole put singing on the back burner and decided to listen to them, she pursued her education, and currently has a respectable career as a law professional. Although she did listen to her parents she still had the burning desire to keep music in her life. Monique Nikkole has owned three recording studios, two production companies, a music management company, a publishing company and film company. With over 20 years of entrepreneurial, business, and professional acumen, Monique Nikkole is a vocalist with a sincere interest in the music industry and has used her spare time to work with rising stars and artists seeking fame and entertainment fortune via her companies. She embodies a unique ability to ferret out and appreciate raw talent; represented via the eclectic and eccentric music from the street and beyond. Monique has finally decided to stand front stage and use all of her music knowledge to catapult her new venture as a “new artist”. Having this continued involvement within her music companies has kept her ear to the street, and her finger pressed firmly on the pulse of the music industry. Monique has worked in multiple capacities within the music business but her true raw talent kept pushing to the surface and has finally erupted! They say the best investment made is in yourself! Here comes Monique Nikkole! (This interview was previously recorded in November 2021)"
