        "text": "You are a practical person who is not easily swayed by utopian ideals or mirages. When all systems are go, your inner strength and stamina will drive you straight to the heart of the material world with no detours or mistakes. You then become the quintessential creator and producer. You create out of love for the phenomenon of creation on every level. Although your innate sense of matter, your earthiness, may sometimes confine you to the material plane, it also endows you with the power to give substance to your intuitions. Your material possessions embody your spirit. You are a person of conviction. You believe in your action; you have faith in your approach. Striding purposefully ahead, you go even farther, more effectively. You are aware you have a job to carry out; you know your duty is to create and construct. As a result, it is important for you to be deeply implicated in your career and to feel as though you are really accomplishing a goal that is important to you. You are coherent and pragmatic, and your life and mind are carefully organized. Improvisation is not your forte; on the contrary, you tend to plan out your work in advance, stick to the plan obstinately, and pace yourself carefully. This tendency may strike others as being somewhat plodding and slow. But the opinion of others means little to you; you judge yourself on the basis of the fruit of your labor. Your accomplishments arouse your pride and possessiveness, since you view them as evidence of your worth. However, the work ethic so prevalent in our society is deeply ingrained in you. Merely by slogging on with your duty, you achieve such personal rewards and satisfactions as the knowledge that your potency never flickers; your inner virility and ability to follow through are steady, sure, and irresistible. The only drawback is that your earthiness and stubbornness may confine your interests to somewhat low horizons. Your capacity for work is related to a capacity for self-devotion. You are able to give your entire being to a great cause, to devote yourself body and soul, with all the might and conscientiousness you possess, if you believe the goal to be your ultimate purpose. Your initial problem is to find the cause you will make your purpose in life, because if you were to err, if you wandered into the trap of a bad cause fraught with risk, you would suffer a terrible setback. Therefore, the essential value which will define your life and destiny is the fruit of a long\n\nShamea Morton is sensual.
