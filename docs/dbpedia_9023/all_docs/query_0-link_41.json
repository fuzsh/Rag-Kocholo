        "text": "Get ready to drive back to your favorite concert venue because The Real Housewives of Potomac’s Candiace Dillard Bassett is about to go on tour. What’s more, at least one stop on her five-city Deep Space tour will feature a very special guest from the Bravo family: The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Shamari DeVoe.\n\n“ATL you all are in for a treat!” Candiace captioned a September 10 Instagram post, promoting her October 24 show at City Winery in Atlanta. “I’m coming to you all as one of my last stops on the [Deep Space Tour 2022] and I’m soooo excited to have R&B legends [Q Parker] and [Shamari DeVoe] as my special guests.”\n\nThe RHOP musician officially announced the City Winery tour on July 13, revealing Philadelphia, Chicago, Nashville, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., as the cities she’d be hitting in late October. Speaking about the Atlanta stop specifically on FOX 5’s Good Day Atlantaon September 8, an “excited” Candiace pointed out that she was born and raised in the Peach State.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch The Real Housewives of Potomac on Peacock and the Bravo app.\n\n“It was really important to me that Atlanta get a special welcome from me, because this is the place that made me who I am. It’s the place where I learned to be a woman, I learned how to be a young lady. I am a Southern girl at heart; Southern hospitality runs through my veins,” she explained. “So being able to come home to a musical city where music is so respected and loved, and hopefully get some of that respect and be taken seriously in my music, is really important to me.”\n\nDuring the interview, she also shared that this will be her first time performing a 60-minute set, joking that she’s already been “oiling up” her knees in preparation for all the choreography. Candiace also revealed that her mom, Dorothy Dillard, rented a bus to bring all her friends and family out to see her perform.\n\nIf Candiace’s tour isn’t coming to a city near you — or if you just want a sneak peek of what’s in store — you can check out the live version of “Drive Back” she debuted on September 9. “A gift from me to you,” the RHOP ’Wife wrote on Instagram, announcing that the new version of her hit song was officially available to stream and download everywhere.\n\nAnd don’t forget that the new season of RHOP kicks off on Bravo on Sunday, October 9, at 8/7c with a 75-minute supersize premiere (!!) and we have a juicy first look at the drama and unexpected familiar faces dropping by this season, above."
