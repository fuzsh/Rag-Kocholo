        "text": "Natina Reed, a member of the '90s R&B singing trio Blaque who also appeared in the hit cheerleading film Bring it On, was killed on the weekend after being hit by a car near Atlanta.\n\nThe Gwinnett County Police Department announced that the rapper, singer and actress died after being struck by a car on a state highway just north of the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn late Friday night.\n\nNew York-born Reed, who would have turned 33 years old on Sunday, was struck by a car at about 10:30 p.m. local time. The car's driver called 911, while another person on the scene tried to revive Reed. She was later pronounced dead at Gwinnett Medical Center.\n\nAccording to police, the driver was not at fault and no charges are expected to be filed. Investigators are trying to determine why Reed was in the roadway.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Reed performed in the trio Blaque with Shamari Fears DeVoe and Brandi Williams. The group, signed by TLC rapper Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes (who died in a car accident in 2002), was known for pop/R&B hits such as Bring It All To Me, 808 and I'm Good.\n\nThe three singers had small roles in the 2000 film Bring It On, appearing as cheerleaders in the East Compton Clovers behind the squad captain, portrayed by Gabrielle Union.\n\nThe group had recently reunited and been working towards a reality show as well creating material for a new album, her bandmates said this weekend.\n\n\"We are devastated by the loss of our group member, sister and friend Natina Reed,\" DeVoe and Williams said in a statement.\n\n\"Natina was a mother, sister, accomplished songwriter, artist and friend. We ask for your prayers at this time for Natina's family. She will forever be missed.\"\n\nReed is survived by Tren Brown, her son with rapper Kurupt, whose real name is Ricardo Emmanuel Brown."
