He was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts.\n\nBiography\n\nDeVoe was the second-to-last member to join New Edition (Johnny Gill being the last) after being brought in by his uncle and the group's choreographer, Brooke Payne. In 1981, the group took second place at a talent show which caught the eye of record producer, Maurice Starr, who signed them to his Streetwise record label. New Edition went on to become the biggest-selling boy band group from the mid to late 1980s.\n\nAfter New Edition's 1990 breakup, Devoe and fellow New Edition members, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins, formed the R&B/hip-hop group, Bell Biv DeVoe. Bell Biv DeVoe's 1990 debut album, Poison, sold more than 5 million copies and garnered five hit singles such as \"Poison\" and \"B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)?\". In 1993, DeVoe and the group released their follow-up album, Hootie Mack.\n\nIn 1996, DeVoe reunited with the other original members of New Edition which saw the release of the album, Home Again, followed by a world tour ending in 1997.\n\nIn 2001, DeVoe and Bell Biv DeVoe released their third album, BBD.\n\nIn 2017, DeVoe and Bell Biv Devoe released their fourth album, Three Stripes.\n\nDeVoe still performs and records with New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe and is co-owner of DeVoe Broker Associates, a real estate agency in Atlanta, Georgia. He has been married to Shamari Fears-DeVoe of the R&B group, Blaque since March 10, 2006.
