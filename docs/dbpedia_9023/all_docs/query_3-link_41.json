        "text": "If anyone knows how to throw a party, it’s New Edition/ BBD pretty boy Ronnie DeVoe, who along with his wife, Blaque lead singer Shamari DeVoe, celebrated their twins’ birthdays over the weekend while surrounded by family and friends.\n\n“Happy 1st Birthday to my babies @DeVoeTwins,” gorgeous mom Shamari shared on Instagram along with photos from the kid-friendly soiree. “Mommy and Daddy love the both of you dearly! ❤️👶🏽❤️👶🏽 7/14/17 #DeVoeTwins.”\n\nThe musical couple first announced their pregnancy back in April of last year with an Instagram post, revealing in May they’d be having not one but two bundles of joy.\n\n“SURPRISE!! Guess what we’re having? —> #TWINS!! <—,” DeVoe wrote on Instagram. “That’s right, the DeVoe Twins are coming!! @ShamariDeVoe and I couldn’t be happier …We’ve been blessed with not 1, but 2 amazingly, incredible bundles of joy. GOD is so good!! We thank all of you for sending your prayers, well wishes and support! Keep it coming… Love you to Life…!”\n\nThe DeVoes used the same platform to share photos of their adorable kids at four months old.\n\nBelieve it or not, the pair have yet to reveal their children’s names to the public, simply referring to them as @DeVoeTwins.\n\nCheck out some adorable photos of the boys below."
