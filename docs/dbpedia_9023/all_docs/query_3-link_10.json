        "text": "Shamari a.k.a. Shamari Fears was born in Detroit, MI. Shamari began cultivating her soulful voice at the tender age of three. When her family relocated to Atlanta, GA in the mid 1980's, Shamari poured herself into her music. During Middle and High School, Shamari began performing publicly. Shamari entered into her school's Talent Show and won 2nd place for her soulful rendition of Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".\n\nShamari's Talent Show success led to the formation of her group Buutz (a country-urban female group). Ever enthusiastic and sure of success, Shamari proclaimed that she had a \"deal\". Soon after, Buutz disbanded and Shamari formed the urban female group Intrigue. During that time, Shamari met Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes of TLC, which resulted in the 1996 joining of Brandi D.\n\nWilliams and Natina Reed, which together formed the sensational, multi-platinum R&B-Pop female group Blaque. As the collective protégé's of Lisa Lopes, Blaque soon began to flourish as the fresh new faces of R&B-Pop, resulting in an invitation for a cameo appearance in Lil' Kim's \"Ladies Night\" video. In 1997, Lisa Lopes flew with the group to NYC to meet with the Chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment Corporation, Thomas D.\n\n\"Tommy\" Mattola. Blaque gave an impromptu performance showcasing their sultry, soulful and innovative style resulting in an immediate contract with Columbia Records. Shamari signed a Solo Artist Recording Deal with Dark Child / Universal Records. Shamari is currently immersed in the creative process of recording her Solo Rock-Urban-Pop Debut Album, which is anticipated for worldwide release in 2006!"
