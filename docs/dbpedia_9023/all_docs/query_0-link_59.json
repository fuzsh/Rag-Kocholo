In 1992, he got his big break when he was signed to German record label, Coconut Records.\n\nIn 1993, Haddaway released his debut single, “What is Love” became a hit, topping the charts in Switzerland, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, France, Finland, Belgium, and Austria. In the U.K., the song peaked at #2 on the U.K. Singles chart, staying on the chart for 16 weeks.\n\nIn Germany, the song peaked at #2 on the Media Control Charts and is the 7th best-selling single of all time in Germany.\n\nIn the United States, the song peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October of 1993, #9 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Club Play chart, #6 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Maxi-Singles Sales chart,#4 on Billboard’s Top 40 Mainstream chart, and #15 on Billboard’s Rhythmic Top 40 chart.\n\nThe song experienced a revival when it was featured on “Saturday Night Live” in the “Roxbury Guy” sketches starring Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. The sketches were later made into the 1998 film, “A Night at the Roxbury” where the song was featured in the film and soundtrack.\n\nDuring that same year, Haddaway released his self-titled debut album (also known as “The Album” internationally), which peaked at #9 on the U.K. Singles chart, staying on the chart for 16 weeks. In the U.S., the album charted at #111 on the Billboard 200 chart and topped Billboard’s Heatseekers Albums chart.\n\nThe second single from the album, “Life (Everybody Needs Somebody to Love)” peaked at #6 on the U.K. Singles chart, staying on the chart for 9 weeks. In Germany, the song also peaked at #2 on the Media Control Charts.\n\nIn the U.S., the song peaked at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February of 1994, #5 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Club Play chart, #3 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Maxi-Singles Sales chart, and #14 on Billboard’s Top 40 Mainstream chart.\n\nThe third single from the album, “I Miss You” peaked at #9 on the U.K. Singles chart, staying on the chart for 14 weeks and in Germany, the song peaked at #18 on the Media Control Charts.

In the U.S., the song peaked at #25 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Club Play chart under the title, “Stir it Up\\Rock My Heart.”\n\nIn 1995, Haddaway released his sophomore album, “The Drive” which made the charts in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland.\n\nThe first single, “Fly Away” peaked at #25 in Germany on the Media Control Charts and #20 on the U.K. Singles chart, staying on the chart for 3 weeks.
