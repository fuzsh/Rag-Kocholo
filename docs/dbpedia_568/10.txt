Ziziphus has some forty species of deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs, natives mainly of tropical and warm temperate regions. Leaves alternate, three- or five-nerved from the base, stipules present, usually converted into spines. Flowers small, perfect, in axillary cymes. Petals five. Stamens five, opposite the petals. Fruit an edible, fleshy drupe; stone with usually two seeds.

The generic name derives from the ancient Greek word for Z. jujuba. It is sometimes wrongly spelt “Zizyphus”.
