        "meta_description": "Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit is one of the largest productions in China and its increasing production has drawn considerable attention from researchers. Polysaccharide is one of the most abundant components of jujube, and it represents a major group of biolotegically active constituents. This study intended to investigate the special structure of a homogeneous acidic polysaccharide (PZMP4) produced from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao fruit using novel methods, including DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. The structure of PZMP4 was determined via high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), gas chromatography (GC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), methylation analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results reveal that PZMP4 with a molecular weight of 27.90&nbsp;kDa was composed of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose, and galacturonic acid at a ratio of 2.32:2.21:0.22:0.88:2.08:8.83. Advanced structural analysis revealed a netted structure with molecular aggregates of PZMP4. Structural features demonstrated that the basic backbone of PZMP4 appeared to mainly consist of (1→4)-linked GalpA with three branches bonded to O-3 of (1→3)-linked Araf, (1→2)-linked Rhap, and terminated with GalpA. PZMP4’s unique structure could imply distinct bioactivities and have considerable utilization in functional food.",

        "text": "Preliminary PZMP4 characterization\n\nZMP was isolated from Z. Jujuba cv. Muzao fruit and extracted by ultrasonic-assisted extraction, ethanol precipitation, deproteination, dialysis, and lyophilization. Further purification was subsequently done using a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 cm × 100 cm), which was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 6.0), and 0.4 M NaCl solution at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. We determined the elution by observing phenol–sulfuric acid, and then passed it through a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.6 cm × 100 cm) with deionized water for further purification. As a result, a single elution peak named PZMP4 was obtained. The total carbohydrate content of PZMP4 was found to be 92.64%. The protein and total phenol contents of PZMP4 were 3.09%, and 0.95%, respectively, higher than the acidic (PZMP2-2) polysaccharide from Z. Jujuba cv. Muzao [8].\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1A, HPGPC revealed that the acidic polysaccharide PZMP4 was homogeneous, with only one symmetrical absorption peak. A standard curve of the logarithm of relative molecular weight associated with elution time (t) was created using a serious detraining, shown as the following: lg Mw = − 0.3259t + 10.9495 (R2 = 99.57%). On the basis of the equation, the average molecular weight of PZMP4 was estimated to be 27.90 kDa with a retention time of 19.983 min. This acidic jujube polysaccharide fraction had a molecular weight similar to HJP-4 (Z. Jujuba cv. Hamidazao polysaccharide) [1].\n\nGC was used to determine the monosaccharide component of PZMP4. The hydrolysate of PZMP4 consisted of six monosaccharides, including rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose, and galacturonic acid (Fig. 1B). Their ratios were 2.32:2.21:0.22:0.88:2.08:8.83, suggesting that PZMP4 was an acidic heteropolysaccharide. Furthermore, the results indicated that rhamnose, arabinose, and galacturonic acid accounted for the majority of the total polysaccharide content. However, the result was different for Z. Jujuba cv. Hamidazao polysaccharide fractions; this may be caused by different raw materials, as well as extraction and purification methods [1, 5].\n\nFT-IR spectrum analysis\n\nThe functional groups and chemical bonds of PZMP4 were further analyzed by FT-IR (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A). The O–H-stretching vibration and the C–H-stretching vibration were represented by distinct bands in the 3411 and 2937 cm−1 regions, respectively. The absorbances at 1741 and 1244 cm−1 demonstrated the existence of uronic acid, which corroborated the results of the uronic acid assay [8, 17]. The symmetrical C=O-stretching vibrations were verified by the high peak at 1610 cm−1 [18]. The 1415 cm−1 peak represented the characteristic absorption of C-H bands, while the 1099 cm−1 peak indicated the pyranose form’s C–O-stretching vibrations [8]. The slight characteristic absorptions at 800–900 cm−1 may indicate the existence of α- and β-configurations [19]. Consequently, FT-IR analysis of PZMP4 revealed absorption peaks of typical plant polysaccharides.\n\nMethylation analysis\n\nPZMP4 was methylated and reacted with trifluoroacetic acid. The resultant partly methylated alditol acetates were examined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Table 1 shows the linkage types and molar ratio percentages of PZMP4 according to the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) Spectral Database for PMAA. PZMP4 contained four main glycosidic linkages, 1,2-linked Rhap, 1-linked GalpA, 1,3-linked Araf, and 1,3,4-linked GalpA with molar percentage ratios of 1.64:1.00:1.52:4.50, thus, implying that the PZMP4’s backbone could only be of 1,4-linked GalpA residues, with branches connected to the O-3 position for some residues. The structure of PZMP4 was further supported by NMR spectroscopy.\n\nNMR analysis\n\nTo determine the detailed structure of PZMP4, one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra were used for further study. The C/H chemical shifts of several glycosidic bonds were consistent with the previous literature; the data are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. The 1H-NMR spectrum of PZMP4 (Fig. 2A) displays four main anomeric proton signals at δ 4.87, 5.00, 4.82, and 5.00/5.05, which were designated as A, B, C, and D, respectively. H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5 of 1,3,4-linked GalpA residues were responsible for the significant peaks in the 3.74–5.06 ppm range. The 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 2B) revealed six anomeric signals resonating at 101.89, 70.79/70.93, 79.42, 84.05, 73.41/73.04, and 173.68/173.80 ppm. According to previous results in the literature, the relevant anomeric carbon signals of tagged residues in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra were attributed to data in the 2D NMR spectra [20, 21]. From the chemical shift data in the COSY (Additional file 2: Fig. S2B), NOESY (Additional file 2: Fig. S2C), 1H/1H TOCSY (Additional file 2: Fig. S2D), HSQC (Additional file 2: Fig. S2E), and HMBC spectra (Additional file 2: Fig. S2F), the proton and carbon assignments of four main residues in PZMP4 are presented in Table 2.\n\nThe signal at δH 5.00 was determined from the chemical shift of the anomeric proton of residue B. The equivalent signal in the anomeric carbon was δC 102.36. The δC 71.45/δH 3.91, δC 70.79/δH 3.63 (3.66), δC 71.59/δH 3.96, δC 74.21/δH 4.32, and δC 178.21 signals were allocated to C-2, C-3, C-4, C-, and C-6 of residue B, respectively [22, 23]. The anomeric proton of residue C had a chemical shift of 4.82 ppm, whereas the anomeric carbon had a chemical shift of 102.36 ppm. The COSY and TOCSY spectra were used to identify the other protons in residue C. According to HSQC, the other comparable carbon and hydrogen signals were 84.19 (4.11/4.04), 71.45 (3.86), 74.85 (3.66), 71.60 (3.69), and 19.44 (1.15) ppm. According to the NMR data, the chemical shifts of this residue were identical to that of α-1,2-linked Rhap [24, 25]. HSQC indicated the other carbon and hydrogen signals with 110.24 (5.00/5.05), 81.61 (4.20), 86.77 (3.94), 83.74 (4.02), and 63.96 (3.62) ppm. From the NMR data, the chemical shifts of this residue were identical to that of α-1,3-linked Galp [26, 27].\n\nHMBC, COSY, and NOESY could determine the glycosidic linkages between sugar residues. Hence, with these techniques, the intra-residue connections were determined and are listed in Table 2. As the HMBC spectrum shows, some inter-residual cross-peaks were identified: A C-3 to D H-1, A C-4 to D H-1, A C-4 to B H-1, D C-3 to D H-1, A C-4 to D H-3, A C-3 to C H-2, and A C-1 to D H-1. In addition, in the COSY spectrum, certain inter-residual cross-peaks were also recognized: C/D H-1 to C/D H-2, A/B H-2 to A/B H-3, A/B/C/D H-3 to A/B/C/D H-4, and C/D H-4 to C/D H-5. A/C H-1 to A H-3 were detected in the NOESY spectrum [28].\n\nAccording to the monosaccharide composition of PZMP4, combined with the results of FT-IR, GC–MS, 1D and 2D NMR analyses, it was determined that PZMP4 was mainly composed of →4)-GalpA-(1→ backbone, with a branching point at the O-3 position consisting of Araf, Rhap, and GalpA residues.\n\nMorphological properties\n\nDifferent morphological properties are key components that contribute to the complexity of polysaccharide forms. SEM, as a microscopic-molecular-morphology observation technique, is frequently used to characterize the surface morphology of polysaccharides [29]. The SEM images of PZMP4 demonstrated the disparate morphological characteristics (Fig. 1C–E). PZMP4 had a rough surface and a netted structure due to molecular aggregation, which was most likely induced by a variety of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups [30]."
