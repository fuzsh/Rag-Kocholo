        "text": "Overview\n\nIndian jujube is a small - to medium sized tropical tree, it can grow up to 25 ft. The tree can withstand extremely hot temperatures, as well as cold temperatures up to - 25 F.\n\nResearch has shown that Indian jujube increases immune-system resistance.\n\nThe root is used in the treatment of dyspepsia (indigestion) and decoctions of the root can be employed in the treatment of fevers.\n\nThe plant is a folk remedy for anemia, hypertonia (abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability to stretch), nephritis and nervous diseases. In China it is used as a treatment for burns (external).\n\nConstituents\n\n(% dry weight): crude protein, 12.9-16.9; fat, 1.5-2.7; fiber, 13.5-17.1; N-free extract, 55.3-56.7; ash, 10.2-11.7; calcium, 1.42-3.74; phosphorus, 0.17-0.33; magnesium, 0.46-0.83; potassium, 0.47-1.57; sodium, 0.02-0.05; chlorine, 0.14-0.38; Sulphur, 0.13-0.33%. They also contain ceryl alcohol and the alkaloids, protopine and berberine, quercetin, kaempferol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, lanosterol, diosgenin.\n\nPharmacology\n\nWild jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) has sedative and tranquilizing properties.\n\nIt is used in formulas where the prime symptoms are: insomnia, night sweats, palpitations and nervous body movements. This seed also has analgesic properties and is an anticonvulsive (antiepileptic, anti-seizure). It is also thought to supply necessary nutrients directly to the heart.\n\nIn traditonal medicine, several plants were used in diabetes treatment. Among them, the aqueous extract from the leaves of Zizyphus mauritiana was studied. The extract was administrated per os to Wistar rats made diabetics either temporarily by oral glucose tolerance test (first case) or definitely by subcutaneous injection of alloxan (second case). It was observed to have a striking decrease of the hyperglycemic arrow (p < 0.05) in the first case, with 300 mg/kg administrated 90 minutes before starting the test. In the second case, the results obtained with a dose of 300 mg/kg once or twice a day were identical as those with glibenclamide (medication to treat diabetes type 2) at 0.2 mg/kg per day. So, the antidiabetic activity was experimentally born out but it has to be standardized for common use.\n\nThe phytochemical Betulinic acid is abundantly found in the Jujube fruit, which is known to exert an anti-melanoma activity by causing apoptosis (programmed cell death) against cancer cells. In another recent study, the fruit extract was found to be effective for inhibiting the tumor cells and cells that can lead to leukemia. Jujube extract inhibited tumor cell proliferation in all lines but displayed the greatest effect against Jurkat leukemia cells.\n\nSaponins in Jujube extracts have hypnotic and sedative effects, which may be precursors to elevated moods. This property is found to be useful in combating depressive symptoms and mood swings. With its stress alleviating properties, it has been found to be useful for calming the nerves and reducing anxiety. When the fruit extract was researched in some mentally ill patients, they were shown to have improved sleep time. Patients were more active and it seemed to improve their mood. Jujube berry extract may be a natural alternative to prescription anti-anxiety and sleep aids, more research is needed.\n\nApplications\n\nIndian jujube is used to cure stomach-aches, in the treatment of syphilis, to calm intestinal irritations. Further for the treatment of respiratory ailments, throat, intestinal, urinary inflammation and for constipation.\n\nIt is helpful in liver troubles, asthma and fever. It has sedative properties and is effective against insomnia and heart palpitations.\n\nThe bark is an effective astringent in dysentery and diarrhea; the fruit, a mild laxative and expectorant.\n\nThe phytochemical betulinic acid, present in this plant, may be helpful against melanoma cells.\n\nBetulinic acid inhibits the growth of cancer cells.\n\nDosage\n\nTincture: 1 - 4 ml. daily\n\nReference\n\nAllergenic Components of Indian Jujube (Zizyphus mauritiana) Show IgE Cross-Reactivity with Latex Allergen\n\nMey-Fann Leea, Yi-Hsing Chenb, Joung-Liang Lanb, Chiang-Yuan Tsenga, Chii-Huei Wu\n\nAcharya SB, Tripathi SK, Tripathi YC, Pandey VB (1988) Some pharmacological studies on Zizyphus rugosa saponins.
