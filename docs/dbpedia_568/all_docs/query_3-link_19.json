Liu (Z. spinosa Hu.), is being more and more utilized and cultivated because of its wide adaptation, important medicinal value, great potential in production of fruits containing high vitamin C and for juice making. To fully utilize the sour jujube germplasms, a total of 211 sour jujube germplasms were sampled from main sour jujube producing area including Hebei, Shanxi and Shannxi province, and the morphological and physiological diversity among germplasms were analyzed. The results showed that sour jujube has a very high agronomic diversity. Its fruit color ranged from orange, red to dark red; fruit shape from oblate, globose, oblong globose, to ovoid; kernel color from orange, red to dark red. The variation coefficient differs with characters. Sugar acid ratio had the biggest variation coefficient (1.0), followed by ratio of fruits with two kernels (0.59), titratable acids content (0.59), average fruit weight (0.56), flavonoids content (0.44), jujubosides content (0.41), vitamin C content (0.40), straight thorn length (0.33), stone weight (0.32), fruit no. per bearing shoot (0.30), secondary branch no. per extension shoot (0.28), total soluble sugar content (0.27), one-thousand-kernel weight (0.26), short thorn length (0.26), extension shoot length (0.26), secondary branch length (0.26), cross diameter of extension shoot (0.22), thickness of kernel (0.20), fruit longitudinal length (0.19), fruit cross diameter (0.19), internodes no. of secondary branch (0.19), stone longitudinal length (0.15), stone shape index (0.14), ratio of kernel (0.14), kernel longitudinal length (0.13), fruit shape index (0.12), stone cross diameter (0.12), kernel cross length (0.11) and ratio of edibility (0.10). One sample K-S tests were conducted for each character to discover the distribution type. Nine characters including sugar acid ratio, average fruit weight, stone shape index, ratio of kernel, kernel longitudinal length, fruit shape index, stone cross diameter, kernel cross diameter and ratio of edibility were not conform normal distribution at 0.01 level. Average stone weight, thickness of kernel and stone longitudinal length were not of normal distribution at 0.05 level. The other 17 characters were of normal distribution.\n\nCitation\n\nLiu, P., Liu, M.J., Zhao, Z.H., Li, X.Y., Yang, L. and Wu, Y.L. (2009).
