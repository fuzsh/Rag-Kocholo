        "text": "Scientific Name\n\nZiziphus mauritiana Lam.\n\nFamily\n\nRhamnaceae\n\nCommon Names\n\nber, chinee apple, Chinese date, cottony jujube, Indian cherry, Indian date, Indian jujube, Indian plum, jujube, sour jujube, Yunnan jujube, Yunnan spiny jujube\n\nOrigin\n\nThis species is thought to have originated in India, and is considered native to southern Asia, eastern Africa and many islands in the Indian Ocean.\n\nNaturalised Distribution\n\nChinee apple (Ziziphus mauritiana ) is widespread in the northern parts of Australia, but is most common in the northern and central regions of Queensland. It is also scattered throughout the northern parts of the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia, and has been recorded from south-eastern Queensland.\n\nIt is also naturalised in southern Africa, south-eastern Aisa (i.e. Malaysia and the Philippines), tropical South America, Central America (e.g. Belize, Guatemala and Panama), southern USA (i.e. California and Florida), the Caribbean, the Cape Verde Islands, and on La RÃ©union and Fiji.\n\nHabitat\n\nA weed of pastures, grasslands, open woodlands, floodplains, inland watercourses, roadsides, disturbed sites and waste areas in semi-arid, tropical and sub-tropical regions.\n\nHabit\n\nA thorny and densely branched large shrub or small tree, with a spreading habit, growing 3-10 m tall and up to 10 m across.\n\nDistinguishing Features\n\na thorny and densely branched small tree.\n\nits young stems have a zig-zagging nature and usually bear a single curved thorn at each joint.\n\nits leaves have dark green and glossy upper surfaces and whitish or rusty-hairy undersides.\n\nits inconspicuous flowers are greenish-yellow or whitish in colour and borne in small clusters in the leaf forks.\n\nits rounded fruit (15-30 mm across) consist of a large hard stone surrounded by white fleshy pulp.\n\nthese fruit turn from green to pale yellow, orange or reddish-brown as they mature.\n\nStems and Leaves\n\nThe young stems have a zig-zagging nature, are finely hairy (i.e. pubescent or tomentose) and are greenish or whitish in colour. They usually bear a single curved thorn (5-20 mm long) and a leaf at each joint. Older stems have a dark grey to blackish coloured bark that is rough and somewhat furrowed.\n\nThe alternately arranged leaves are borne on stalks (i.e. petioles) 2-16 mm long. These leaves are relatively small (20-80 mm long and 8-50 mm wide) and somewhat oval (i.e. sub-elliptic) in shape or egg-shaped in outline (i.e. ovate). Their upper surfaces are dark green in colour, hairless (i.e. glabrous) and glossy, while their lower surfaces are covered with whitish or rusty coloured hairs (i.e. they are tomentose). These leaves have three conspicuous main veins and finely toothed (i.e. serrulate) or almost entire margins.\n\nFlowers and Fruit\n\nThe inconspicuous flowers (5-8 mm across) are greenish, greenish-yellow or whitish in colour. They may either have male and female parts (i.e. bisexual flowers) or only male parts (i.e. staminate flowers). These flowers are usually arranged in small loose clusters in the leaf forks (i.e. axils), with each cluster usually containing 10-15 flowers. The individual flowers are borne on short hairy stalks (i.e. tomentose pedicels) up to 4 mm long and consist of five hairy sepals (1.2-1.5 mm long) that are fused at the base (i.e. into a five-toothed calyx tube), five membranous petals (about 1.2 mm long), five stamens, and the bisexual flowers also have an ovary with two or three styles. Flowering mostly occurs from late summer through to early winter.\n\nThe fruit consists of a large hard stone surrounded by a white fleshy pulp and a surface skin (i.e. it is a drupe). These fruit (15-50 mm across) are rounded (i.e. sub-globular) or egg-shaped (i.e. ovoid) and turn from green to pale yellow, orange, red or reddish-brown in colour as they mature. The hard stone contains two rounded (i.e. sub-globular) or oval shaped (i.e. ellipsoid) seeds (6-8 mm long) that have a hard outer skin.\n\nReproduction and Dispersal\n\nThis species reproduces entirely by seed.\n\nThese seeds are most commonly dispersed by large birds and other animals (e.g. livestock, feral pigs and native animals) that eat the fruit.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nChinee apple (Ziziphus mauritiana) is regarded as an environmental weed in Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is actively managed by community groups in Queensland and was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in five Natural Resource Management regions.\n\nLegislation\n\nThis species is declared under legislation in the following states and territories:\n\nNorthern Territory: A - to be eradicated (outside of the Darwin, Palmerston, Litchfield and Alice Springs local authority areas), and C - not to be introduced into the Territory.\n\nQueensland: Class 2 - landowners must take all reasonable steps to keep land free of this species (throughout the entire state). It is also illegal to sell a declared plant or its seed in this state.\n\nWestern Australia: P1 - the movement of this species or its seeds is prohibited (throughout the entire state), and P5 - infestations of the weed on public lands must be controlled (in the Broome, Derby-West Kimberley, Halls Creek and Wyndham-East Kimberley local authority areas).\n\nManagement\n\nFor information on the management of this species see the following resources:\n\nthe Biosecurity Queensland Fact Sheet on this species, which is available online at http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au.\n\nthe Northern Territory Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts Agnote on this species, which is available online at http://www.nt.gov.au/weeds.\n\nSimilar Species\n\nChinee apple (Ziziphus mauritiana) is similar to two closely related native species (i.e. Ziziphus oenopolia and Ziziphus quadrilocularis) and strychnine tree (Strychnos lucida). These species can be distinguished by the following differences:"
