        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis article summarizes jujube importation and culture history and current jujube cultivars in the United States. Described within are jujube taxonomy, biology, adaptation, fruit nutrition, pests and diseases, propagation, and research conducted in the United States. It also discusses the current issues with jujubes in the United States and possible solutions to them. Jujube adapted and grew well in the southern and southwestern United States, and it could become a valuable industry in the United States within 15 to 20 years.\n\nJujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill), also called chinese date, red date, or tsao (zao), is native to China (Liu, 2006; Qu, 1963). It originated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and has been cultivated in China for more than 4000 years (Guo and Shan, 2010; Liu, 2006). Botanically, it is derived from its wild relative sour jujube or wild jujube (Z. spinosa Hu). In ancient times, people selected and cultivated sour jujubes with big fruit and good flavor, and it gradually became the cultivated modern jujube species (Z. jujuba). There are still semicultivated sour jujubes like ‘Tiger Eye’, big round, sour jujube, and Yanjishan big sour jujube, which are popular in Beijing and Shandong Province, China, respectively (Guo and Shan, 2010).\n\nJujube was first dispersed within China from its original center and then to countries bordering China. It was through the famous “Silk Road” that jujubes were introduced to Europe at the beginning of the Christian era (Liu, 2006; Lyrene, 1979). It is widely distributed in Persia, Armenia, Syria, Spain, and France (Locke, 1948; Lyrene, 1979). Most early jujube imported to Europe were seedlings (Locke, 1955; Lyrene, 1979) and were used as a table dessert or winter sweetmeat.\n\nLiu (2006) reviewed the jujube basics and research in China and worldwide. Lyrene (1979) briefly summarized the jujube tree situation in the United States. This review focuses on the cultivar history, biology, adaptation, and production challenges in the United States and makes a comparison with the jujube situation in China whenever necessary."
