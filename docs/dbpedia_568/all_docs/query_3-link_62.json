        "text": "Ziziphus jujuba Lam. (Rhamnaceae) is commonly known as “Ber (Jujube)”. In India, fruits of the plant consume fresh, dried and pro- cessed forms. This study evaluates the nutritional composition and physical endurance of jujube fruits in two forms: (1) lyophilised jujube pulp (ZJP) and (2) hydro-alcoholic extract of jujube pulp (ZJE). Free amino acids, vitamins, carbohydrates, proximate analysis and anti-fatigue activity were investigated by an experimental animal model. High concentrations of vitamin C were observed in ZJP (13.8 %) and ZJE (21.4 %). Glucose and fructose were significantly higher in ZJP compared to ZJE (p < 0.05). In the weight loaded forced swim test (WFST), exercise performance (swimming time) was significantly increased by the supplementation of ZJE and ZJP compared to the control group after 10 days. Tissue biochemical parameters and antioxidant enzyme studies confirms that both ZJE and ZJP had strong physical endurance capacity. The results showed in the study suggesting that Z. jujuba i.e. ZJP and ZJE affords anti- fatigue activity by improving swimming time in weight loaded forced swim test on experimental animal models. Information pro- vided in this study will be helpful for developing applications of jujube in food technology as functional and nutraceutical ingredient.\n\nKeywords: Food Supply Chain; Climate Change; Artificial Intelligence; Business Models; Global Circular Debt; Covid 19 Pandemic; Natural Health; Science Principles; Food as Medicine; Business Intelligence; Sustainable Development Agenda Goals 2023; United Nations"
