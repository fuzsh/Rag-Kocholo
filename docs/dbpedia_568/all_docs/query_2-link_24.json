Balikai\n\nAbstract\n\nThough as many as 130 species of insect pests have been recorded in India, only few species have attained the pest status and cause substantial economic damage to ber. However, a total of 22 insects and non-insect pests feeding on ber were recoded from the extensive ber growing districts of Karnataka state. Out of these, thee insects viz., ber fruit borer, Meridarchis scyrodes Meyrick and two species of ber fruit flies, Carpomyia vesuviana Costa and Dacus correctus (Bezzi) were recorded as major pests on this crop with infestation varying from high to very high degree, whereas five insects (Grape mealy bug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green); Ber mealy bug, Perissopneumon tamarindus (Green); Ber fruit weevil, Aubeus himalayanus Voss; Castor semilooper, Achaea janata Linn. and Snail, Cryptozona semirugata (Beck)) were recorded as moderate pests. As many as nine insect pests viz., Cow bug, Tricentrus bicolor; Thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis (Hood); Longicorn beetle, Celeosterna scabrator Fabricius; Gray weevil, Myllocerus discolor (Boheman); Spiny beetle, Platypriya andrewesi Weise; Hairy caterpillar, Thiacidas postica Walker; Tassar silk moth, Anthearea paphia Linnaeus; Tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) and Eriophyid mite, Eriophyes cernus Massee were recorded as minor pests on this crop. Five insect pests including Green striped leaf hopper, Eurybrachys tomentesa Fab.; Jassid, Amrasca biguttula biguttula (Ishida); Spittle bug, Machaerota planitiae Distant; Lac insect, Laccifer lacca Kerr. and Ber butterfly, Tarucus theophrastus (Fabricius) were recorded as negligible pests. Various management practices for these pests are discussed in this paper.\n\nCitation\n\nBalikai, R.A. (2009).
