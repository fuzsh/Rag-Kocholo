Its origin is southern Asia and has been cultivated in China for 4000 years where there are 400 known varieties. It can attain a height of 20′ and 12′ wide with shiny green foliage and bears a small oval fruit in late November – January. The fruit is eaten fresh when it is still smooth and green and has the consistency and taste of a tarte apple.\n\nThe trees at Richard Lyons Nursery currently have fruit available for picking.\n\nRichard Lyons Nursery also has trees for sale."
