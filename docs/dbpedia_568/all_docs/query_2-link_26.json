        "text": "3.2. Taxonomic Classification\n\nFopius carpomyiae (Silvestri, 1916) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)\n\nDiagnosis. Fopius carpomyiae has a pale coloration body; frons densely covered with large punctures; second metasomal tergite striate, with a relatively short ovipositor, and the ovipositor tip is not narrowed apically. The species is closely related to Fopius arisanus (Sonan, 1932) and F. vandenboschi (Fullaway, 1952) but has a shorter ovipositor. Wharton [46] provided a table of morphological features that facilitate the comparison of known species of Fopius.\n\nRemark. Farrar and Chou [26] believe this Oriental species [47,48] has been recently introduced to Iran and stablished in Bushehr’s orchards, southern Iran. We did not sample it from our rearing, but the species was reported from southern Iran as an egg–larval endoparasitoid of BFF on Ziziphus spina-christi by Farrar and Chou [26]. The percentage parasitism of this wasp was estimated to be 24% in Tangestan, Bushehr province [24].\n\nGalesus nr. silvestrii (Kieffer, 1913) (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae)\n\nMaterial examined: 1♀, Iran: South Khorasan province, Mood (59°31′23″ E, 32°42′31″ N), 1851 m, 20.vii.2012, A. Amini, leg. 2♀♀, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, 11.vii.2012, A. Amini, leg. 1♂, Birjand, Chahkand (32°50′49″ N, 59°09′20″ E), 1551 m, 21.vii.2012, A. Amini leg.\n\nRemark. This species was reared from puparia of BFF. The species of the genus Galesus are well-known parasitoids of fruit flies. Our reared specimens were compared by David Notton, a Diapriidae specialist, with identified specimens in NHMUK [31] and related publications (such as 43). He found it to be similar to Galesus silvestrii in body color and sculpturing on the sclerites. Considering that these parasitic wasps received little attention in the Palaearctic region and that there is no updated reliable key for species discrimination, its identification remains uncertain.\n\nGalesus as a genus native to North Africa is very easy to recognize, although it was previously included in the genus Psilus. In Palaearctic keys; for example, Nixon [40] and Kozlov [43]; it keys out as Psilus. Muesebeck [39] separated Coptera with, most obviously, the head shape with transverse carina in front of the occipital carina, longitudinally folded wings usually with an apical notch, and very short apical gastral segments.\n\nAximopsis augasmae (Zerova, 1977) (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) ( and )\n\nMaterial examined: 15♀♀, 3♂♂, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, vii.2017, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. The most important characters to distinguish A. augasmae from closely related species were discussed by Zerova and Khodzhevanishvili [38], Zerova and Seryogina [45] and Lotfalizadeh and Hosseini [49].\n\nThis species is characterized by the following characters: body generally black, with some parts brown (legs and antenna partly) ( a,b). Gena distinctly carinate posteriorly, postgenal lamina present and raised, joining genal carina ventrally ( e,f). Clypeus not delimited dorsally, strigose, truncate on ventral margin ( d). All funiculars longer than broad in females ( a); often asymmetric, strongly tapering apically and with whorls of long hairs in males ( b). Mesepimeron strigose, with a horizontal ventral shelf in front of mesocoxal foramina ( g). Mesodiscrimen with projecting triangular tooth in front of mesocoxal foramina ( g), epicnemium completely delimited. Postmarginal vein distinctly longer than stigmal and marginal veins (1.2 and 1.8 times, respectively) ( i,j). Procoxa with an oblique carina on the frontal side, delimiting, ventrally, a depression ( c). Metasoma as long as mesosoma and head together ( a), with a short petiole, shorter than width; horizontal ovipositor sheaths ( h).\n\nRemark. BFF infesting Z. jujuba represents a new host for A. augasmae that develops as a solitary endoparasitoid of the larvae. This species is distributed in the eastern part of the West Palaearctic [28] and has been previously reared on Augasma atraphaxidellum Kuznetz (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) on Atraphaxis spinosa L. (Polygonaceae) and other moth species on Zygophillum [45], as well as Etiella zinckenella (Treitschke) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) on Sophora alopecuroides L. (Leguminosae) [49].\n\nEurytoma pineticola Zerova, 1981 (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) ( and ).\n\nMaterial examined: 25♀♀, 12♂♂, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, vi.2017, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. Eurytoma pineticola is characterized by a strigose supraclypal area ( g), gena as long as eye height; funiculars in females distinctly longer than wide ( a), antennae of males with five funiculars and two clavomeres ( b); adscrobal carina of mesopleuron not elbowed and exhibiting a unique tooth in front of mesocoxa, mesepisternal shelf not developed ( f); marginal vein 1.5 times as long as stigmal vein ( e); metasoma as long as mesosoma ( a), slightly compressed laterally and slightly elevated at apex ( c); Gt4 is the largest tergite.\n\nEurytoma pineticola is closely related to Eurytoma serratulae (Fabricius) and can be separated by the characters mentioned in the key.\n\nRemark. This species was reared for the first time on larvae of BFF infesting Z. jujuba. However, it was already reported from non-frugivorous tephritid such as Paratephritis transitoria (Rohdendorf) in the flower head of Parasenecio hastatus (L.) H.Koyama (Asteraceae) [41].\n\nEurytoma serratulae (Fabricius, 1798) (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) ( , and ).\n\nMaterial examined: 14♀♀, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, vii.2017, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. Eurytoma serratulae is characterized by its punctured supraclypeal area ( c,d), clypeal margin slightly emarginate ( d); gena conspicuously carinate posteriorly, postgena with ventral depression and posterior margin of gena forming a blunt angle and emarginate lateral to edge of oral fossa; postgenal lamina present, ventrally raised, in lateral view appearing as a tooth. In females, funiculars longer than wide ( a), with two clavomeres that are nearly always fused; notauli complete and not obliterated ( b), axillar groves with a pit at mid-length, obliterated by sculpture anteriorly, their bottom thus not clearly visible; epicnemium not entirely delimited, adscrobal carina of mesopleuron not elbowed, forming a single tooth in front of mesocoxa ( a); propodeum with a median furrow, not impressed and situated in a broadly concave surface ( b); ovipositor sheaths relatively horizontal ( a).\n\nThis species is close to Eurytoma compressa (Fabricius, 1794), and females can be separated by the shape of metasoma. While the metasoma of E. serratulae is elongated, slightly flattened laterally and relatively less raised dorsally with a shorter ovipositor ( a), the metasoma of E. compressa females in the lateral view is round, strongly flattened, with a vertically raised Gt7 and a long ovipositor.\n\nRemark. Eurytoma serratulae was reared for the first time from larvae of BFF. This species was previously reported as a parasitoid of other fruit flies, Myopites longirostris (Loew, 1846) (under M. frauenfeldi (Schiner, 1868)) [50], Tephritis stictica Loew, 1862 [50], Urophora cardui (L., 1758) [51] and an unknown species of Urophora sp. [34]. Eurytoma pineticola belongs to the serratulae species group that occurs in the Holarctic region and parasitizes gall-inducing Cynipidae (Hymenoptera), Tephritidae (Diptera) and Curculionidae (Coleoptera) [34,52]. Claridge [35] suggested that E. serratulae only parasitized gall-maker tephritids in stems of Asteraceae, but our finding demonstrated that the species can also parasitize larvae of fruit flies on Rhamnaceae.\n\nCyrtoptyx lichtensteini (Masi, 1921) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)\n\nMaterial examined: 24♀♀, 6♂♂, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, vii.2017, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. The most important characteristics of C. lichtensteini were summarized by Lotfalizadeh and Hosseini [49] and Mete and Lotfalizadeh [53]. See in Mete and Lotfalizadeh [53] for the morphological details of this species.\n\nThe main morphological characters of the species are as follows: body black with bluish-green reflections on mesosoma, metasoma with reddish-blue reflections laterally and Gt1 with greenish reflections dorsally. Tibiae and tarsi are mainly whitish. Antennal formula 1,1,3,5,3, scape slightly exceeding the anterior ocellus, all funiculars longer than wide, Fu1 about twice as long as wide, clava 2.5 times as long as wide. Marginal vein longer than postmarginal and stigmal veins; relative measurements: marginal vein: 13; stigmal vein: 10; postmarginal vein: 12. Metasoma is about 2.2 times as long as broad and about 1.25 times as long as mesosoma.\n\nRemark. This species is an ectoparasitoid of the larval stage, and it was reported on Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera [49,53] and widely distributed in the Palaearctic (from Europe and North Africa to China) and Nearctic regions [28].\n\nPteromalus sp. (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) ( and ).\n\nMaterial examined: 2♀♀, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand (32°51′59″ N, 59°13′55″ E), 1465 m, vii. 2017, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. Some of the noticeable morphological characters of this undetermined species are POL about 1.6 times as long as OOL; clypeus bilobed, strigose dorsally ( a); antennal toruli located in the center of head ( a); antennal formula 1,1,2,6,3, all funiculars slightly longer than wide ( a); pronotum anteriorly carinate ( c); fore wing basally bare, with large open speculum, marginal vein as long as postmarginal vein, 1.5 times as long as stigmal vein ( b); propodeum mainly smooth, slightly reticulate anteriorly, without median carina ( b).\n\nRemark. This species is a larval ectoparasitoid of BFF. Several species of the genus Pteromalus have been previously reared from fruit flies [54].\n\nSmicromyrme (Eremotilla) tekensis Skorikov, 1935 (Hymenoptera: Mutilidae)\n\nMaterial examined. 1♀, Iran: South Khorasan province, Mood (32°42′ N, 59°31′ E), 1839 m, Sarbishe, 33 km SE Birjand, vii.2013, A. Amini leg. 1♀, Birjand, Razg village (32°53′ N, 59°13′ E), 1470 m, i.2012, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. The alate male of this species exhibits the following distinctive characters: mandible bidentate with well-developed subventral tooth, separated by excision; clypeus somehow flattened, without preapical teeth; head behind the eyes strongly convergent in dorsal view, without posterolateral angles. Apterous females have a triangular pygidial area, conspicuously widened basally with oblique striae throughout its length, lateral carina not widened apically; mesoscutellar scale well developed.\n\nRemark. This species was reported from China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan [55] and Iran [30]. It is a pupal parasitoid of BFF in soil.\n\nSmicromyrme (Astomyrme) nikolskajae Lelej, 1985 (Hymenoptera: Mutilidae)\n\nMaterial examined. 1♀, Iran: South Khorasan province, Birjand, Razg village (32°53′ N, 59°13′ E), 1470 m, 14.x.2012, A. Amini, leg. 1♀, 2♂, Same locality, iix.2013. 1♂, 33 Km SE Birjand, Sarbishe, Mood (32°42′ N, 59°31′ E), 1839 m, A. Amini, leg.\n\nDiagnosis. The species is recognized by the following characters: mandible without subventral tooth; if an inconspicuous tooth is present, then the mandible has no excision; clypeus weakly elevated medially with two apical tubercles; antenna brownish-red, paler ventrally. In females, striae of the pygidial area not reaching the posterior margin, posterior third smooth; mesosoma with well-developed antero- and posterodorsal angles, dorsally more or less flattened (in lateral view); baso-medial pale spot of second metasomal tergum, 2.5–3.0 times distance between spot and medial apex of apical pale band of same tergite.\n\nIn the subgenus Astomyrme, this species is closely related to Smicromyrme ausonius Invrea, 1950, but the male of S. nikolskajae can be separated by its smaller body size (body size is larger in S. ausonius, 6.0–10 mm), the clypeus weakly elevated medially bearing two apical tubercles (concave with three preapical tubercles in S. ausonius), and antenna brownish-red, paler beneath (antenna black, rarely reddish-brown beneath in S. ausonius).\n\nThe female of S. nikolskajae is mostly smaller (3.2–4.0 mm) than S. ausonius (3.0–6.0 mm); the distance between baso-medial pale spots and the apical pale band on Gt2 in S. nikolskajae is about two times as long as S. ausonius; in the S. nikolskajae apical, 1/3 of the pygidial area is smooth, while in the S. ausonius apical, 1/4–1/5 of the pygidial area is smooth.\n\nRemark. This species is known to exist in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan [55] and has also been reported to be in Iran [30].\n\nKey to the hymenopterous parasitoids of BFF, Carpomya vesuviana in Iran\n\n- Fore wing usually with enclosed cell, male apterous (only in Mutillidae) 2\n\n- Fore wing without enclosed cell ( j, d, c and b) 4\n\n- Gt1 node-like; pronotum usually indistinctly fused with mesothorax, pronotum medially less than one-third dorsal length of mesonotum-propodeum; Gs1 separated from Gs2 by a deep constriction; body covered with long hairs Mutillidae 3\n\n- Metasoma without node-like segments; pronotum distinctly separated from and larger than mesonotum; Gs1 and Gs2 not separated by a constriction; body without long hairs Braconidae, Fopius carpomyiae\n\n- In males, mandible beneath without subventral tooth, if with inconspicuous one then without excision; clypeus medially weakly elevated with two apical tubercles; in females, pygidial area with striae not reaching posterior margin, apically smooth; apical 1/3 of pygidial area not sculptured, smooth Smicromyrme nikolskajae\n\n- In males, mandible bidentate, beneath with well-developed subventral tooth separated by excision; clypeus flattened, without two preapical teeth; in females, pygidial area triangle, conspicuously widened basally with striae throughout; pygidial area with oblique striae Smicromyrme tekensis\n\n- Pronotum more or less U-shaped in dorsal view; medial length usually less than one-quarter as long as mesoscutum; Gt1 several times as long as any other tergite and much wider than petiole, petiole cylindrical Diapriidae, Coptera nr. silvestrii\n\n- Pronotum rectangular, longer than mesoscutum medially; Gt1 shorter than other tergites and wider; petiole conical 5\n\n- Pronotum short and transverse ( a); body finely sculptured, with green metallic reflection ( a,b and a) Pteromalidae 6\n\n- Pronotum long and shoulder-like, body coarsely sculptured ( b); body black without metallic reflection ( a,b and a,b) Eurytomidae 7\n\n- Fu1 distinctly longer than pedicel; clypeus ventrally emarginated; propodeum smooth, with a median carina Cyrtoptyx lichtensteini\n\n- Fu1 shorter than pedicel ( a); clypeus ventrally bilobed ( a); propodeum smooth, without median carina ( b) Pteromalus sp.\n\n- Mesopleuron with horizontal ventral shelf in front of mesocoxal foramen, adscrobal carina of mesopleuron elbowed ( g); sublateral prepectus with a deep pit, its bottom not or rarely visible; epicnemium always completely delimited by a carina Aximopsis augasmae\n\n- Mesopleuron without ventral shelf, adscrobal carina of mesopleuron not elbowed, forming a single tooth in front of mesocoxa ( a); sublateral prepectus sometimes different; epicnemium laterally delimited by epicnemial carina, not ventrally 7\n\n- Lower face with strigose supraclypeal area ( g); pedicel brownish-dark ( a); all coxae black, all femora medially black ( a) Eurytoma pineticola\n\n- Lower face often with punctured supraclypeal area ( c); pedicel yellow ( b); fore and mid coxae yellow, all femora mainly yellow ( a) Eurytoma serratulae"
