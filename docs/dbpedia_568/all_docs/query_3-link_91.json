        "text": "Oils of Zyziphus spina (Z. spina) and Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) seeds were analyzed for physicochemical, phytochemical and lipid composition. M. oleifera seeds gave oil yield of 40.47% while Z. Spina seeds gave 30%. Refractive index, density and acid value (mg KOH g-1) of M. oleifera oil were 1.471, 0.81, 1.16 while Z .spina had 1.441, 0.79, 7.57 respectively. Similarly, Iodine (Wijs), Saponification (mg KOH g-1) and Peroxide (meq kg-1) values obtained for M. oleifera oil were 46.50, 166.77 and 2.16 whereas Z. spina had 86.40, 184.00 and traces respectively. The phytochemical analysis showed the presence of secondary metabolites such as saponin, flavonoids, terpenoid, sterol and balsam in M. oleifera and alkaloids, flavonoid, terpenoid, sterol and resin in Z. spina. Lipid composition showed the presence of neutral lipids, glycolipid and phospholipid in both Z. spina and M. oleifera.\n\nThis study investigated the physico-chemical properties, functional properties, and chemical compositions of Ziziphus mauritiana (Jujube) seed oil using standard analytical methods. The results indicated that Jujube seed oil exhibited swelling capacity of 6.10±0.23 %, water absorption capacity of 20.22±0.45, oil absorption capacity of 18.53±0.43%, bulk density of 0.583±0.01%, gelatinization temperature of 72.34±1.67%, foaming stability of 56.36±0.12%, foaming capacity of 8.29±0.02%, emulsion ability of 30.21±0.13 and emulsion stability of 27.62±0.89. the oil also shows specific gravity of 0.913±0.08 Kg/L, acid value of 2.27±0.17 mgKOH/g, saponification value of 192.40±9.98 mgKOH/g, peroxide value of 2.22±0.12 mmol/Kg, free fatty acid of 1.14±0.09 % and iodine value of 66.74±4.29 g/100g. a total of 19 chemical compound were identified from Z. mauritiana seed oil using GC-MS. The most abundant compound N-[3-[N-Aziridyl] propylidene] hexyl amine with retention time (RT) and peak area (...\n\nThe current trend of using natural products from the plants, either as pure constituents or as standardized extracts, provides numerous opportunities for novel drugs, precisely the wild edible plants. Ziziphus spina Christi plant is considered as one of the most important therapeutic and nutritional wild edible plants because of containing bioactive compounds. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the petroleum ether Ziziphus spina Christi seed oil via using two analytical methods: GC-MS, and FTIR spectrometer. The seed oil was extracted by using Soxhlet apparatus. The GC-MS analysis indicated the presence of seventeen fatty acids, eight of them are majors constituents, namely 7-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester [28.11%], Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester [19.63%], Methyl stearate [16.97%], Eicosanoic acid, methyl ester [10.76%], Docosanoic acid, methyl ester [8.60%], cis-11-Eicosenoic acid, methyl ester [4.79%], Tetracosanoic acid, methyl ester [2.62%], and Squalene [2...\n\nBer is a tropical fruit which grows from the tree species, Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk. The pericarp of this fruit is consumed either fresh or dried while its seeds are usually discarded as waste. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant activity and phenolic content of the fruit, and to evaluate if any potential value-added phytochemicals can be extracted from seed waste.\n\nNeem tree is a folklore plant mostly used in medicinal preparations. Therefore, neem seeds were investigated with the aim of determining its fatty acid composition and physicochemical properties of the oil extract. The oil was extracted from the powdered seed using n-hexane with the help of Soxhlet which yielded 29.71% oil. Results revealed that the oil was liquid at room temperature and physically stable at varying temperatures (0, 50 and 100°C). It appeared to be pale greenish yellow, garlic-like odour, had a little bitter taste, viscosity of 12.2Pas and pH value of 6.78 ± 0.0135. The chemical parameters were identified to be 1.22 ± 0.029%, 2.36 ± 0.054 mg NaOH/g oil, 172.84 ± 0.559 mgNaOH/g oil and 1.88 ± 0.059 meq/kg oil for free fatty acids, acid value, saponification value and peroxide value respectively. The GC-MS analysis showed that the oil extract contained six different fatty acids with total composition of 63.07% oil. The compound with the highest composition was linolei...\n\nZiziphora clinopodioides Lam. is as an important medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Ziziphora species are medicinal and aromatic plants that traditionally are used for the treatment of various diseases. In this study, essential oil of wild populations of Z. clinopodioides collected from various natural habitats in the alpine regions, Southwestern Iran was investigated. The hydro-distillated essential oils analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The essential oil yields ranged from 0.12 to 0.98 ml/100 gm dry plants. Results indicated that the main chemical compositions were pulegone (5.19 to 57.85%), limonene (0.26 to 12.79%), 1,8-cineole (0.00 to 27.4%), p-mentha-3-en-8-ol (2.03 to 15.15%), neo-menthol (0.36 to 7.56%), bornyl acetate (0.47 to 9.37%), and piperitenone (0.70 to 9.05%). There were significant differences among the essential oils from Z. clinopodioides populations for yield oil and the major constituents such as pulegone, 1,8-cineole, p-mentha-3-en-8-ol, bornyl acetate, and piperitenone. In conclusion, the main source of variability in chemical composition and oil yield of the studied populations of Z. clinopodioides seemed to be a difference in environmental conditions and chemotypes as plant populations collected from close geographical areas were classified in a cluster.\n\nThe volatile constituents from fresh aerial parts (leaves and flowers) of Zizyphus jujuba and fruits of Zizyphus spina-christi (Rhamnaceae) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The major oil constituents were found to be phytol (29.1 %), borneol (10.1 %) and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (9.1 %) for Z. jujuba aerial parts. The fruit oil of Z. spina-christi was comprised mainly of fatty acids and their esters, of which dodecanoic acid (22.4 %) was the main component.\n\nOil was extracted from the seeds of groundnut, melon and Moringa oleifera. The physicochemical properties of groundnut oil, melon oil and moringa oil were determined. The acid value obtained was 9.76 mgKOH/g, 7.85 mgKOH/g and 1.91 mgKOH/g for moringa, melon and groundnut oil respectively. The Iodine value was found to be 35.85 mg/g, 83.75 mg/g and 59.64 mg/g for moringa, melon and groundnut oil respectively. The Peroxide values were moringa oil - 13.80 meq/kg, melon oil - 5.60 meq/kg and groundnut oil - 10.80 meq/kg. Unsaponifiable matter values were moringa oil - 8.59 g/kg, melon oil - 2.18 g/kg, groundnut oil - 5.77 g/kg while the saponifica-tion values were moringa oil - 155.68 mgKOH/g, melon oil - 180.92 mgKOH/g and groundnut oil - 168.30 mgKOH/g. The volatile mat-ter in the oils was found to be 0.06. 0.07 And 0.04 in groundnut, melon and moringa oil respectively. All the oils were pale yellow in colour and liquids at room temperature. The results obtained from the physicochemical characterization of the oils shows that moringa oleifera seed oil compares favourably with the other oils and has high potentials for use both as domestic oil and as industrial oil."
