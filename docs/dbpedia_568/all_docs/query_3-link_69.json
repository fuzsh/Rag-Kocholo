        "text": "Soil moisture has an important effect on the growth of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Therefore, research on soil moisture must be conducted for stable growth and continuous production. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether soil moisture supply is necessary depending on the jujube growth period. The height, width, and cane diameter of jujube trees were found to be greater in the soil moisture -10 kPa treatment. The mineral content of leaves was high at -10 kPa for K, and the mineral content of fruit after harvest was high at -10 kPa for N, P, and Ca. And fruit yields were higher in the soil moisture -10 kPa treatment, especially large fruits exceeding 30 mm in diameter. The length, width and weight of the fruit were high at -10 kPa, but the soluble solid content was high at -30 kPa. Therefore for stable fruit production of jujube, soil moisture of -10 kPa is required during the flowering and fruiting stages and fruit enlargement stage, and in order to produce jujube fruit with high sugar content, the irrigation amount must be reduced to -30 kPa before harvest."
