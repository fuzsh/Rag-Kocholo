This was a small tree.\n\n– What is the size of fruits? I think this could be a Zizipus sp.\n\n– Around 1-2 cm….similar to that of an olive. Have photographed from a distance, so can’t say the exact size.\n\n– Does look like ZIziphus from the spines (one curved upwards, other downwards) and leaves.\n\n– This could be Toran [Zizyphus rugosa]. Have recently posted photographs of this fruiting.\n\nAnother plant from Anshi : 2 posts by 2 authors. Attachments (4).\n\nposting another plant from Anshi.

The leaves are infested with some unusual white pattern. The last photo is a cropped image depicting the spines.\n\nI’m not sure of which plant it is. The “patterns” however are caused by leaf miners. They are small insects which eat the leaf from inside leaving lines where chlorophyll is absent. They are considered quite a pest.\n\nThis is a species of Ziziyphus [with marks left on the leaves after the caterpillars of a species of Pierrot butterfly feed on them].\n\nI think it should be Ziziphus rugosa as per images and details herein.\n\nidentification no200912sn2: Kindly Identify this plant.

And the wooden winged fruit belongs to Saj tree? What about the parasitic flower…\n\nwhich is the parasitic flower in your opinion? which picture or pictures?\n\nThis one…\n\n… has answered all nicely, It is not parasite, it is Dendrobium, orchid, an epiphyte, winged fruit is Saj tree as you mentioned (Terminalia elliptica)\n\nThank you so much!
