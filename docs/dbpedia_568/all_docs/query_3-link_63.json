Being a multimillennial fruit crop in China, jujube has a high importance in the Chinese diet due to its complex nutraceutical properties. Nearly 1000 varieties and local genotypes are cultivated in China on over 2 million hectares on low input production systems. Even if it was introduced in Dobrogea region, some 2,000 years ago by the Greek and Roman colonists, jujube plants and fruits are nearly unknown, as it happens in other countries from the Mediterranean basin. The first cultivated varieties were introduced at the Faculty of Horticulture in Bucharest from Shanxi Province, China within a common research project in 1997. During more than twenty years, a complex research program has been carried out. The first task was to determine the adaptation of the most important jujube genotypes at the local growing conditions.
