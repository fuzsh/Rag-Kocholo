Control groups have obvious differences. The ziziphus jujube mill rhizosphere bacillus sp. capable of promoting growth is inoculated in fermented chicken manure to prepare a biological fertilizer, and is used around the root of seven-year ziziphus jujube mill, thereby, the root vitality is substantially raised, the content of the root secretion in the ziziphus jujube mill rhizosphere soil is increased, and the absorption and utilization capability of the soil nutrient of the ziziphus jujube mill rhizosphere is enhanced.\n\nDescription\n\nThe one living subtilis of strain winter jujube rhizosphere growth-promoting and application thereof\n\nTechnical field\n\nThe present invention relates to the living subtilis of strain winter jujube rhizosphere growth-promoting and an application thereof.\n\nBackground technology\n\nWinter jujube (Ziziphus jujube Mill.) is Rhamnaceae (Rhamnaceae) zizyphus (Ziziphus Mill.) plant, mainly be distributed in the Huanghe delta one band of China, originate in China, VC content is very high, can reach 400ï½600mg/100g, higher 10ï½13 times than citrus fruits, nutrition is very abundant, has high nutritive value and food therapy value.The production management process of winter jujube is very complicated, and fertilising is one of them very important link.The Fertilization Effect of winter jujube is except the impact that is subjected to soil, the nutritive property of forest own, rate of fertilizer application, and is also relevant with fertilizer variety.At present, the fertilising of winter jujube is take readily avaiable fertilizer as main, but winter jujube root system is undeveloped, poor growth, and capillary radical amount is few, poor nutrient absorption capability.Therefore, general readily avaiable fertilizer can not satisfy winter the recuperate characteristics of minute demand chronicity and persistence of jujube tree.In addition, along with the increase of global energy crisis and applying quantity of chemical fertilizer, the negative impact that readily avaiable fertilizer is used constantly manifests.A large amount of chemical fertilizer use the fruit quality that has not only affected the winter jujube, also environment has been caused potential threat.Descend such as the Sustainable Production ability of soil, the eutrophication of soil compaction, surface water resources, the groundwater resource nitrate content exceeds standard etc.Therefore, seeking a kind of new-type fertilizer, to satisfy the demand of winter jujube tree bulk-growth particularly important.Microbial fertilizer can not only be improved soil, improves the ecotope of soil fauna, can also the Effective Raise plant to the absorption of soil nutrient.Therefore, seek new biomass fertilizers, to substitute or the research of part replacing fertilizer seems particularly important.\n\nThe microorganism of plant rhizosphere is many and enliven, and has consisted of the distinctive micro-flora of rhizosphere.Plant rhizosphere urge endophytic bacteria (PGPR) be existence in the plant rhizosphere scope, direct or indirect Promoting plant growth or pathogenic bacteria is had the useful bacterium general designation of antagonistic action.The short endophytic bacteria of plant rhizosphere can be secreted the plant growth-promoting material, comprises plant hormone, VITAMIN, amino acid and other active organic molecule and derivative etc.Also can improve the nutrient environment of plant rhizosphere, effectively control Plant diseases etc.The monoid of the short endophytic bacteria of plant rhizosphere is various, wherein existing useful population, also harmful population.According to incompletely statistics, found to comprise that the short endophytic bacteria of more than 20 plant rhizospheres that belong to such as pseudomonas and bud pole bacterium has disease prevention growth-promoting potential.At present, the screening of relevant winter jujube rhizosphere growth-promoting endophytic bacteria bacterial strain and the research of application have no report.\n\nSummary of the invention\n\nFor above-mentioned prior art, the invention provides the living subtilis of strain winter jujube rhizosphere growth-promoting and an application thereof.\n\nThe present invention is achieved by the following technical solutions:\n\nThe living subtilis of one strain winter jujube rhizosphere growth-promoting,, its Classification And Nomenclature is bacillus sp., is preserved in China Committee for Culture Collection of Microorganisms common micro-organisms center on October 11st, 2011,
