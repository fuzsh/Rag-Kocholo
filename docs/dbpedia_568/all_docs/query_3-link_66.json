Furthermore, growth indexes were regularly monitored to estimate jujubes biomass. Sap flow, meteorological and soil moisture conditions were monitored using thermal dissipation probes (TDP), weather station (RR-9100) and the combination of time domain transmission (TDT) technology and neutron moisture gauges (CNC503B), respectively. The results showed that daily actual transpiration of jujube was positively correlated with leaf biomass. Compared with PI-1, jujube transpiration during growth period under PI-2, PI-3, and PI-4 dropped by 11.1%, 29.2%, and 47.9%, respectively. On the contrary, annual water storage under PI-2, PI-3, and PI-4 increased by 6.29 mm, 25.78 mm and 34.74 mm while water use efficiency increased by 5.1%, 15.7% and 24.2%, respectively. Overall, increase in pruning intensity could significantly reduce water consumption of jujube and improve soil moisture in jujube plantations.\n\nSimultaneous determination of rhamnose, xylitol, arabitol, fructose, glucose, inositol, sucrose, maltose in jujube (Zizyphus jujube Mill.) extract: comparison of HPLC-ELSD, LC-ESI-MS/MS and GC-MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Shihao; Wang, Hui; Xie, Jianping; Su, Yue\n\n2016-01-01\n\nJujube extract is commonly used as a food additive and flavoring. The sensory properties of the extract, especially sweetness, are a critical factor determining the product quality and therefore affecting consumer acceptability. Small molecular carbohydrates make major contribution to the sweetness of the jujube extract, and their types and contents in the extract have direct influence on quality of the product. So, an appropriate qualitative and quantitative method for determination of the carbohydrates is vitally important for quality control of the product. High performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD), liquid chromatography-electronic spay ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods have been developed and applied to determining small molecular carbohydrates in jujube extract, respectively. Eight sugars and alditols were identified from the extract, including rhamnose, xylitol, arabitol, fructose, glucose, inositol, sucrose, and maltose. Comparisons were carried out to investigate the performance of the methods. Although the methods have been found to perform satisfactorily, only three sugars (fructose, glucose and inositol) could be detected by all these methods. Meanwhile, a similar quantitative result for the three sugars can be obtained by the methods. Eight sugars and alditols in the jujube extract were determined by HPLC-ELSD, LC-ESI-MS/MS and GC-MS, respectively. The LC-ELSD method and the LC-ESI-MS/MS method with good precision and accuracy were suitable for quantitative analysis of carbohydrates in jujube extract; although the performance of the GC-MS method for quantitative analysis was inferior to the other methods, it has a wider scope in qualitative analysis. A multi-analysis technique should be adopted in order to obtain complete constituents of about the carbohydrates in jujube extract, and the methods should be employed according to the\n\nEffect of harvest, drying and storage on the bitterness, moisture, sugars, free amino acids and phenolic compounds of jujube fruit (Zizyphus jujuba cv. Junzao).\n\nPubMed\n\nPu, Yunfeng; Ding, Tian; Wang, Wenjun; Xiang, Yanju; Ye, Xingqian; Li, Mei; Liu, Donghong\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe taste of dried jujube fruit when compared with fresh ones is less palatable, as it develops bitterness during drying and storage. Therefore, identifying the methods by which bitterness occurs is essential for developing strategies for processing and storage. Bitterness in fresh jujube fruit was negligible; however, it increased by 0.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold during drying and storage over 6 and 12âmonths. The moisture significantly decreased during harvesting and drying. Free amino acids, except proline and tyrosine, significantly decreased during drying and storage. Fructose, glucose and sucrose hardly changed during harvest, drying and storage. Titratable acidity, total phenolic and total flavonoids contents were stable during harvest and drying, but increased upon storage. Additionally, protocatechuic and ellagic acids were not detected in fresh jujube fruit, however, were found to increase during drying and storage. Bitterness in fresh jujube fruit tasted negligible because of meagre amount of phytochemicals, while the condensation effect of moisture reduction, the loss of free amino acids, and the formation of protocatechuic and ellagic acids could aggravate the bitterness of jujube fruit during drying and storage.

The present study aimed to develop one Chinese prescription, Shenzao Cha (SZC), consisting of American ginseng and Chinese jujube, and systematically investigate its immunomodulation in healthy ICR mice. Normal ICR mice received intragastric administration of SZC (1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 g raw material/kg body weight) once daily for four weeks, while a control group received the same amount of sterile water. SZC significantly increased the spleen and thymus indices and T-lymphocyte proliferation, while the T-lymphocyte proliferation in the 5.2 g/kg group was 1.4-fold higher than that in the control. Further, 1.3 g/kg SZC could markedly improve hemolytic activity by 25.2%, and 2.6 g/kg SZC increased the NK cell activity by 78.6% relative to the control. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase), that participated in modulating oxidative stress, were significantly increased in the liver, spleen, thymus, and serum, while the contents of malondialdehyde were dramatically decreased. SZC exhibited potent immunomodulatory effects on innate and adaptive immunity in healthy ICR mice, as well as potential antioxidant activity for prevention of oxidative stress, which was suggested to partly contribute to the immune enhancement.\n\nExtraction and determination of total flavonoids in jujube by alcohol extraction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJi, Y. B.; Ru, X.; Yu, M.; Wang, S. W.; Lu, L.; Qiao, A. N.; Guo, A. Z.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nJujube is a ripe fruit of Rhamnaceae. Its main active component is flavonoids, so the extraction and determination of total flavonoids in jujube will help to develop and utilize the medicinal value of jujube. In this study, the total flavonoids were extracted from jujube by alcohol extraction method. Through single factor investigation and orthogonal test, it was found that the total flavonoids content in jujube was the highest under the condition of 70Â°C, material ratio of 1:40, and extraction of 30 min by 70% ethanol. The content of total flavonoids in the extract of jujube was 1.57% at the wavelength of 510 nm by UV and rutin as the standard. The method was evaluated by methodological study, and it was determined that this method could be used as the detection of total flavonoids in jujube extraction.\n\nDetermination of Betaine in Jujube by Capillary Electrophoresis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Likun; Liu, Haixing; Peng, Xuewei\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis paper presents the determination of betaine content in jujube by high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) method. The borax solution was chosen as buffer solution, and its concentration was 40 mmol at a constant voltage of 20kV and injecting pressure time of 10s at 14Â°C. Linearity was kept in the concent ration range of 0.0113â¼1.45mg of betaine with correlation coefficient of 0.9. The content of betaine in jujube was 85.91 mg/g (RSD = 16.6%) (n = 6). The recovery of betaine in jujube sample was in the range of 86.2% - 116.6% (n=3). This method is specific, simple and rapid and accurate, which is suitable for the detection of the content of betaine in jujube.\n\nResidue analysis and risk assessment of tebuconazole in jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill).\n\nPubMed\n\nYou, Xiangwei; Li, Yiqiang; Wang, Xiuguo; Xu, Jinli; Zheng, Xiao; Sui, Chengcheng\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIn this study, a sensitive and reliable analytical method, based on a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe procedure, was established for determination of tebuconazole in jujube. After extraction with acetonitrile, the samples were cleaned up by dispersive solid-phase extraction with primary secondary amine, and determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. At fortification levels of 0.01, 0.1 and 2.0 mg kg -1 , the average recoveries of tebuconazole in jujube were in the range 97.6-101.9%, with relative standard deviations of 1.5-3.5%. The dissipation and residual levels of tebuconazole in jujube under field conditions were investigated. Tebuconazole dissipated relatively slowly in jujube, with a half-life of 33.0 days. The terminal residue experiments of tebuconazole in jujube were conducted in four locations in China and the risk was evaluated using risk quotients (RQ). RQ values were found to be significantly lower than RQ = 1, indicating that the risk to human health of using the recommended doses of tebuconazole in jujube was not significant. This study could provide guidance for the safe and reasonable use of tebuconazole in jujube and serve as a reference for the establishment of limit of maximum residue in China.

The extraction conditions, i.e. temperature, time, and ethanol concentration, were optimized at the following respective values: 61.2 Â°C, 38 h, and 60.4% for pulp, and 58 Â°C, 34 h, and 59.2% for seed. The jujube nanoparticle size significantly increased with a higher chitosan/sodium tripolyphosphate ratio and extract concentration. Entrapment efficiency was greater than 80% regardless of preparation conditions. The stabilities of jujube pulp and seed extract in terms of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were effectively enhanced by nanoencapsulation. In conclusion, jujube pulp and seed extracts prepared using optimal conditions could be useful as a natural functional food ingredient with antioxidant activity, and nanoencapsulation can be used to improve the stability of jujube extract. Therefore, these results could be used to promote the utilization of not only jujube pulp but also seed, by product. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Given that the quality of jujube available on the market differs on account of various factors such as geographical environment, cultivar, processing conditions, and storage conditions, and that, for consumers, flavour and nutrition properties of jujube represent the major parameters in determining the quality of jujube, the main goal of this study were to determine the main physico-chemical properties of jujube fruits, sugars and organic acids profiles, protein, mineral constituents, volatile composition and sensory profile of jujube fruits. This would allow breeders to select cultivars with higher levels of nutrients and also enable increasing dietary intake by consumers. Investigations showed that jujube fruit weight ranged from 4.8 to 29.3âg fruit(-1) . Four sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose and sorbitol) and four organic acids (citric, malic, ascorbic and succinic acids) were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography in jujube fruits. Potassium, calcium and magnesium were the major mineral constituents in jujube fruits. Fifteen volatiles compounds were found in the aroma profile of jujube fruits (nine were aldehydes, three terpenes, one ester, one ketone and one linear hydrocarbon). The results showed that Spanish jujube cultivars studied are a good source of vitamin C, and they have a low content of Na. The jujube cultivar with the most appreciated quality by consumers was GAL; the GAL fruits were sweet, crunchy, and had high intensities of jujube ID and apple flavour a long after-taste. Therefore, jujube grown in Spain has a great potential to be exploited for functional foods. Â© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

The aim of the study was to characterize the microbial diversity in stored jujube fruits. I used Biolog in experiment. The types of micro-plates were Filamentous Fungi micro-plate and Economicmicro-plate. There was much difference in microbial functional diversity on the surface of stored jujube fruit. The microbial functional diversity of stored 30 days was richer than it of stored 15 days. The diversity, homogeneity and average well color development of jujube used by fruit perservatives were lower than it not used by fruit preservatives. There were six kinds of the characteristic carbon. Our study firstly showed microbial diversity on the surface of stored jujube fruit. Biolog could be applied in the research on microbial functional diversity of fruit surface.\n\nJujube honey from China: physicochemical characteristics and mineral contents.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Juan; Suo, Zhirong; Zhao, Pinpin; Cheng, Ni; Gao, Hui; Zhao, Jing; Cao, Wei\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe investigated and compared the physicochemical properties (moisture, color, ash, pH, electrical conductivity, free acidity, lactonic acidity, total acidity, fructose, glucose, sucrose, diastase activity, and HMF) and mineral contents (Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, As, Cd, Pb, and Zn), as well as total proline and total protein contents of 23 jujube honey samples collected from different regions of China. The mineral content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The physicochemical values were in the range of approved limits (conforming to EU legislation) in all 23 samples. The physicochemical properties of jujube honey showed significant variations among samples. The mean pH value of the jujube honeys was 6.71. The most abundant minerals were potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium, ranging between 1081.4 and 2642.9, 97.1 and 194.2, 7.79 and 127.8, and 10.36 and 24.67 mg/kg, respectively, and potassium made up 71% of the total mineral content. This study demonstrated remarkable variation in physicochemical parameters and mineral contents of jujube honey, mainly depending on its geographic source.

Here, we report a draft genome of the dry jujube cultivar 'Junzao' and the genome resequencing of 31 geographically diverse accessions of cultivated and wild jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa). Comparative analysis revealed that the genome of 'Dongzao', a fresh jujube, was ~86.5 Mb larger than that of the 'Junzao', partially due to the recent insertions of transposable elements in the 'Dongzao' genome. We constructed eight proto-chromosomes of the common ancestor of Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae, two sister families in the order Rosales, and elucidated the evolutionary processes that have shaped the genome structures of modern jujubes. Population structure analysis revealed the complex genetic background of jujubes resulting from extensive hybridizations between jujube and its wild relatives. Notably, several key genes that control fruit organic acid metabolism and sugar content were identified in the selective sweep regions. We also identified S-locus genes controlling gametophytic self-incompatibility and investigated haplotype patterns of the S locus in the jujube genomes, which would provide a guideline for parent selection for jujube crossbreeding. This study provides valuable genomic resources for jujube improvement, and offers insights into jujube genome evolution and its population structure and domestication.\n\nResponse of jujube fruits to exogenous oxalic acid treatment based on proteomic analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Qing; Lai, Tongfei; Qin, Guozheng; Tian, Shiping\n\n2009-02-01\n\nIn this study, we found that oxalic acid (OA) at the concentration of 5 mM could delay jujube fruit sene-scence by reducing ethylene production, repressing fruit reddening and reducing alcohol content, which consequently increased fruit resistance against blue mold caused by Penicillium expansum. In order to gain a further understanding of the mechanism by which OA delays senescence and increases disease resistance of jujube fruit, we used a proteomics approach to compare soluble proteome of jujube fruits treated with water or 5 mM OA for 10 min. A total of 25 differentially expressed proteins were identified by using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Among these proteins, alcohol dehydrogenase 1, which plays a direct role in ethanol metabolism, was repressed, and the abundances of three photosynthesis-related proteins was enhanced in jujube fruit after OA treatment. The protein identified as a cystathionine beta-synthase domain-containing protein, which can regulate ethylene precursors, was also induced by OA treatment. The activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase was significantly suppressed in OA-treated jujube fruit. In addition, three proteins related to the defense/stress response were up-regulated by OA, and contributed to the establishment of systemic resistance induced by OA in jujube fruits. These results indicated that OA treatment might affect ethanol and ethylene metabolism, resulting in delaying senescence, and increase resistance of jujube fruits against fungal pathogens.\n\nThe Jujube Genome Provides Insights into Genome Evolution and the Domestication of Sweetness/Acidity Taste in Fruit Trees\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWan, KangKang; Zhang, Zhong; Pang, Xiaoming; Yin, Xiao; Bai, Yang; Sun, Xiaoqing; Gao, Lizhi; Li, Ruiqiang; Zhang, Jinbo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nJujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is a popular fruit tree species with immense economic and nutritional value.

The effect of two cell wall degrading enzymes, namely pectinase and viscozyme, on the nutraceutical composition of Zizyphus juice was investigated in the present study. Enzyme assisted processing significantly (P < 0.05) improved the juice yield, total soluble solids, total phenolics and total antioxidant activity (AOX). There was significant increase in recovery of antioxidants, to the tune of 70.51%, 66%, and 45% respectively in ascorbic acid, total phenolics and total flavonoids through viscozyme. The in-vitro total AOX of juice extracted via enzyme-assisted processing was 20.9 and 15.59 Î¼mol Trolox/ml in ferric-reducing antioxidant power and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity assays, respectively. There was 41% increase in AOX of juice extracted with enzyme over straight pressed juice. Results indicate that enzyme-assisted processing can significantly improve the functional properties of the Zizyphus juice.\n\nThe cytotoxic activity of Ziziphus Jujube on cervical cancer cells: In Vitro study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoshyar, R; Jamali, S; Fereidouni, M; Abedini, M R\n\n2015-12-30\n\nRecently, there are tendency to use natural products such as Ziziphus Jujube (Jujube) as therapeutic agents for cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer effects of Jujube may improve the current therapeutic strategies against cervical cancer. Our MTT data showed a significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of OV-2008 cell proliferation following Jujube administration. Moreover, qRT-PCR analyses significantly revealed the suppression of cyclin D1 and the enhancement of P53, P21 and P27 expression in treated cells. These results suggest that the herb exerts a cytotoxic effect on cervical cancer cells through alternation of the expression of the genes that are involved in regulation of cell cycle.\n\nChanges in free amino acid, protein, flavonoids, and phenolic content in jujube (Ziziphus jujube) fruit during eight stages of growth and antioxidative and cancer cell inhibitory effects by extracts\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe widely consumed Korean Boeun-deachu variety of jujube (Ziziphus jujube) was analyzed by HPLC, MS, and MS-MS for changes in the content of crude protein, free amino acids, and individual flavonoids at eight stages (S1-S8) of ripeness.

Animals were randomly divided into six groups: sham group, model group, estrogen group, low dose group, middle dose group and high dose group. The ovariectomized rat models were established by resection of the lateral ovaries. The effect of compound of gardenia oil and jujube seed oil on learning and memory in ovariectomized rats was observed by means of Morris water maze. Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities in rat brain were determined. The compound of gardenia oil and jujube seed oil could shorten the incubation period of appearance in castration rats and increase the number passing through Yuan Ping table in ovariectomized rats. As the training time extended, the incubation period of appearance was gradually shortened. The compound of gardenia oil and jujube seed oil could increase NOS activity, and decrease AChE activity in brain of ovariectomized rats. The compound of jujube seed oil and gardenia oil could promote the learning and memory in ovariectomized rats. This effect may be related with the increase in activities of NOS, AchE in rat brain.\n\nAntioxidant properties of jujube honey and its protective effects against chronic alcohol-induced liver damage in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Ni; Du, Bing; Wang, Yuan; Gao, Hui; Cao, Wei; Zheng, Jianbin; Feng, Fan\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe antioxidant potential of jujube honey, one of the most widely consumed honeys in China, has never been determined fully. In this study, jujube honey from six geographical origins in China was analyzed for individual phenolic acid, total phenolic content, and the antioxidant effect in chronic alcohol-related hepatic disease in mice. The results showed that jujube honey from Linxian of Shanxi province contained higher phenol levels, exhibited DPPH antioxidant activity, ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and protective effects against DNA damage. Treatment with jujube honey (Shanxi Linxian) for 12 weeks significantly inhibited serum lipoprotein oxidation, reduced the impact of alcoholism on aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). It also inhibited the generation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), lowered the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The study indicates that jujube honey exerts potent antioxidant activity and significant protection in hepatic disorders associated with chronic alcoholism. The protective effect is attributed to its antioxidant mechanisms and inhibition of oxidative degradation of lipids.\n\nEffects of postharvest salicylic acid dipping on Alternaria rot and disease resistance of jujube fruit during storage.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Jiankang; Yan, Jiaqi; Zhao, Yumei; Jiang, Weibo\n\n2013-10-01\n\nConsiderable postharvest losses caused by Alternaria alternata often occur in Chinese jujube fruit, and synthetic fungicides have been widely used to protect the fruit from Alternaria rot. However, the potential harmfulness of fungicide residues to human health and the environment cannot be ignored. This study was conducted to develop an alternative approach for controlling postharvest disease by inducing fruit resistance with salicylic acid (SA) dipping. Disease incidence and lesion area in the jujube fruit inoculated with A. alternata were significantly inhibited by 2 and 2.5 mmol L(-1) SA dipping. Naturally infected decay rate and index in jujubes were also significantly reduced by SA dipping during long-term storage at 0Â°C. SA enhanced activities of the main defense-related enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxidase, chitinase and Î²-1,3-glucanase in the fruit during storage. SA strongly decreased catalase activity but increased superoxide dismutase activity and ascorbic acid content in jujubes. The beneficial effects of SA on fruit protection may be due to its ability to activate several highly coordinated defence-related systems in jujubes, instead of its fungicidal activity. The findings indicated that application of SA would offer an alternative approach that helps to control postharvest disease and maintain storage quality in fruits.

The results showed that spore germination of Alternaria alternata was significantly inhibited by each of the 3 doses (1, 5, and 10 kJ m(-2) ) in vitro. In vivo, UV-C treatment (5 kJ m(-2) ) or antagonist yeast was capable of reducing the percentage of infected wounds and lesion diameter in artificially inoculated jujube fruits, however, in fruit treated with combination of UV-C treatment and M. pulcherrima, the percentage of infected wounds and lesion diameter was only 16.0% and 0.60 cm, respectively. The decay incidence on winter jujube fruits treated with the combination of UV-C treatment and M. pulcherrima was 23% after storage at 0 Â± 1 Â°C for 45 d followed by 22 Â°C for 7 d. None of the treatments impaired quality parameters of jujube fruit. Thus, the combination of UV-C radiation and M. pulcherrima could be an alternative to synthetic fungicides for controlling postharvest Alternaria rot of winter jujube.

In this study, we examined the tolerance of wild jujube to NaHCO3-NaOH solution and analyzed gene expression profiles in response to alkaline stress. Physiological experiments revealed that H2O2 content in leaves increased significantly and root activity decreased quickly during alkaline of pH 9.5 treatment. For transcriptome analysis, wild jujube plants grown hydroponically were treated with NaHCO3-NaOH solution for 0, 1, and 12 h and six transcriptomes from roots were built. In total, 32,758 genes were generated, and 3,604 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. After 1 h, 853 genes showed significantly different expression between control and treated plants; after 12 h, expression of 2,856 genes was significantly different. The expression pattern of nine genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. After gene annotation and gene ontology enrichment analysis, the genes encoding transcriptional factors, serine/threonine-protein kinases, heat shock proteins, cysteine-like kinases, calmodulin-like proteins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers were found to be closely involved in alkaline stress response. These results will provide useful insights for elucidating the mechanisms underlying alkaline tolerance in wild jujube.

GC-MS results showed that a total of 51 aroma compounds were identified in jujubes, hexanoic acid, hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-2-heptenal, benzaldehyde and (E)-2-nonenal were the main aroma components with contributions that over 70%. Differentiation of jujube varieties was conducted by cluster analysis of GC-MS data and principal component analysis & linear discriminant analysis of E-nose data. Both results showed that jujubes could be mainly divided into two groups: group A (JZ, PDDZ, JSXZ and LWZZ) and group B (BZ, YZ, MZ, XZ and DZ). There were significant differences in contents of alcohols, acids and aromatic compounds between group A and B. GC-MS coupled with E-nose could be a fast and accurate method to identify the general flavor difference in different varieties of jujubes. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, the demand for activated carbon is increasing. In this study, we investigated the optimum manufacturing conditions for producing activated carbon from ligneous wastes generated from food processing. Jujube seeds and walnut shells were selected as raw materials. Carbonization and steam activation were performed in a fixed-bed laboratory electric furnace. To obtain the highest iodine number, the optimum conditions for producing activated carbon from jujube seeds and walnut shells were 2 hr and 1.5 hr (carbonization at 700 degrees C) followed by 1 hr and 0.5 hr (activation at 1000 degrees C), respectively. The surface area and iodine number of activated carbon made from jujube seeds and walnut shells were 1,477 and 1,184 m2/g and 1,450 and 1,200 mg/g, respectively. A pore-distribution analysis revealed that most pores had a pore diameter within or around 30-40 angstroms, and adsorption capacity for surfactants was about 2 times larger than the commercial activated carbon, indicating that waste-based activated carbon can be used as alternative. Implications: Wastes discharged from agricultural and food industries results in a serious environmental problem. A method is proposed to convert food-processing wastes such as jujube seeds and walnut shells into high-grade granular activated carbon. Especially, the performance of jujube seeds as activated carbon is worthy of close attention. There is little research about the application ofjujube seeds. Also, when compared to two commercial carbons (Samchully and Calgon samples), the results show that it is possible to produce high-quality carbon, particularly from jujube seed, using a one-stage, 1,000 degrees C, steam pyrolysis. The preparation of activated carbon from food-processing wastes could increase economic return and reduce pollution.\n\nEffect of Chitosan Coating with Cinnamon Oil on the Quality and Physiological Attributes of China Jujube Fruits\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXing, Yage; Lin, Hongbin; Cao, Dong; Xu, Qinglian; Han, Wenfeng; Wang, Ranran; Che, Zhenming; Li, Xihong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEffects of chitosan coating with cinnamon oil on the physiological attributes and preservation quality of China jujube fruits during storage at 4Â°C for 60 days were investigated. Results indicated that weight loss and decay of jujube fruits were significantly reduced by chitosan-oil coating during the period of 60-day storage, which also exhibited a quite beneficial effect on maintaining the sensory quality for jujube fruits. Meanwhile, the contents of vitamin C and titratable acid decreased to 3.08âmgÂ·gâ1 and 0.342% for the fruits treated by chitosan-oil coating (1.0% + 0.10%), respectively. Polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase activities were 13.40âUÂ·gâ1, 14.53âUÂ·gâ1, and 63.6âUÂ·gâ1 at the end of storage, respectively. The contents of total soluble phenolics and MDA were 34.51âmgÂ·gâ1 and 19.43 Î¼molÂ·gâ1 for the combined coating treated samples and control fruits, respectively. These results suggested that the chitosan-oil coating might be recognized as one efficiency technology on the preservation quality of jujube fruits during the storage time.

To facilitate selection of the suitable processing method for jujube fruits, in this study their contents of triterpenic acids, nucleosides, nucleobases and saccharides after drying and steaming treatment were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detector methods. The results showed that except for sucrose, the content levels of most analytes were increasing in the jujube fruits during drying treatment at 45 Â°C. The levels of cyclic nucleotides such as adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, were significantly decreased after the fruits were steamed. Therefore, owing to the bioactivities of these components for human health, the dried fruits would be the better choice as medicinal material or functional food, and dried jujube fruit should not be further steamed.\n\nEffect of paste processing on residue levels of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin and fipronil in winter jujube.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Wei; Zhao, Liuwei; Liu, Fengmao; Xue, Jiaying; Li, Huichen; Shi, Kaiwei\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe changes of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin and fipronil residues were studied to investigate the carryover of pesticide residues in winter jujube during paste processing. A multi-residue analytical method for winter jujube was developed based on the QuEChERS approach. The recoveries for the pesticides were between 87.5% and 116.2%. LODs ranged from 0.002 to 0.1 mg kg(-1). The processing factor (Pf) is defined as the ratio of pesticide residue concentration in the paste to that in winter jujube. Pf was higher than 1 for the removal of extra water, and other steps were generally less than 1, indicating that the whole process resulted in lower pesticide residue levels in paste. Peeling would be the critical step for pesticide removal. Processing factors varied among different pesticides studied. The results are useful to address optimisation of the processing techniques in a manner that leads to considerable pesticide residue reduction.\n\nProduction of nano bacterial cellulose from waste water of candied jujube-processing industry using Acetobacter xylinum.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Zheng; Wang, Lifen; Hua, Jiachuan; Jia, Shiru; Zhang, Jianfei; Liu, Hao\n\n2015-04-20\n\nThe work is aimed to investigate the suitability of waste water of candied jujube-processing industry for the production of bacterial cellulose (BC) by Gluconacetobacter xylinum CGMCC No.2955 and to study the structure properties of bacterial cellulose membranes. After acid pretreatment, the glucose of hydrolysate was higher than that of waste water of candied jujube. The volumetric yield of bacterial cellulose in hydrolysate was 2.25 g/L, which was 1.5-folds of that in waste water of candied jujube. The structures indicated that the fiber size distribution was 3-14 nm in those media with an average diameter being around 5.9 nm. The crystallinity index of BC from pretreatment medium was lower than that of without pretreatment medium and BCs from various media had similar chemical binding. Ammonium citrate was a key factor for improving production yield and the crystallinity index of BC. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the existence of organophosphates (OPs), organochlorines (OCs), pyrethroids (PYs) and fungicides (FUs) were investigated in persimmons/jujubes and their planted soils, which were collected from China. One OP (dimethoate), three OCs (DDT, quintozene and aldrin), six PYs (bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate and deltamethrin) and two FUs (triadimefon and buprofezin) were found in 36.4% of persimmons and 70.8% of jujubes, with concentrations from 1.0 Î¼g/kg to 2945.0 Î¼g/kg. The most frequently detected pesticides in the two fruits were fenpropathrin in persimmons and cypermethrin in jujubes, with the detection frequencies of 30.0% and 22.7%, respectively. The residues of 4.5% (persimmon) and 25.0% (jujube) of samples were higher than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) of China. Compared with the fruits, more types of pesticides and higher residues were observed in their planted soils. The most frequently detected pesticides were HCH in persimmon soil and DDT in jujube soil, with the detection frequencies of 10.9% and 12.7%, respectively. For the tested samples, 39.1% of fruit samples and 63.0% of soil samples with multiple residues (containing more than two pesticides) were noted, even up to 8 residues in fruits and 14 residues in soils. Except for cyhalothrin, the other short-term risks for the tested pesticides in the fruits were below 10%, and the highest long-term risk was 14.13% for aldrin and dieldrin. There was no significant health risk for consumers via consumption of the two fruits. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Jujube polysaccharide conjugates (JPC) were isolated from the fruits of Z. Jujube. General physicochemical properties of JPC were analyzed. A four-week rats CFS model was established and JPC were orally administrated, the behavior experiments were conducted after CFS. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum were elevated and T lymphocyte proliferation, CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio and natural killer (NK) cells activity were analyzed. JPC markedly improved behaviors of CFS rats, also decreased MDA levels in serum, and elevated T lymphocyte proliferation, CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio and natural killer (NK) cells activities. This suggests that JPC can improve the immune system and antioxidant activity of CFS rats and might be regarded as a biological response modifier. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The unique jujube aroma and the mild sweet aroma of the extract are critical factors that determine product quality and affect consumer acceptability. The aroma changes with changes in the extraction condition, which is typically dependent on the characteristics of volatile oils in the extract. Despite their importance, the volatile oils of jujube extract have received less attention compared with the soluble components. So, an appropriate qualitative and quantitative method for determination of the volatile oils is vitally important for quality control of the product. A method coupling steam distillation/drop-by-drop extraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (S3DE/GC-MS) was developed to determine the volatile components of jujube extract. Steam distillation was coupled with solvent extraction; the resulting condensate containing volatile components from jujube extract was drop-by-drop extracted using 2Â mL of methyl tertiary butyl ether. The solvent served two purposes. First, the solvent extracted the volatile components from the condensate. Second, the volatile components were pre-concentrated by drop-by-drop accumulation in the solvent. As a result, the extraction, separation, and concentration of analytes in the sample were simultaneously completed in one step. The main parameters affecting the S3DE procedure, such as the water steam bubbling rate, extraction solvent volume, sample weight and S3DE time, were optimized. The standard addition approach was essential to obtain accurate measurements by minimizing matrix effects. Good linearity (R 2 Â â¥Â 0.9887) and good repeatability (RSDsÂ â¤Â 10.35%, nÂ =Â 5) for 16 analytes in spiked standard analyte samples were achieved. With the S3DE/GC-MS method, seventy-six volatile compounds from jujube extract were identified and the content of 16 compounds was measured. The results were similar to those from simultaneous distillation\n\nEffect of gamma irradiation on some physicochemical properties and bioactive compounds of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba var vulgaris) fruit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNajafabadi, Najmeh Shams; Sahari, Mohammad Ali; Barzegar, Mohsen; Esfahani, Zohreh Hamidi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInterest in the protection of bioactive compounds and a safe alternative method for preservation of processed fruits and fruit juices has recently increased significantly throughout the world. There is a distinct lack of information on the profile of bioactive compounds in jujube fruit (e.g. organic acids, anthocyanins, and water-soluble vitamins) and their changes during processing (e.g. gamma irradiation). Therefore, in this study, the effect of gamma irradiation at different doses (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 kGy) on some physicochemical properties and the bioactive compounds of jujube fruit was investigated. The total soluble solids (TSSs) values remained unaffected at various doses, while the level of total acidity (TA) showed a slight increase at doses â¥ 2.5 kGy (p â¤ 0.05). Irradiation up to 2.5 kGy caused a significant increase in the total monomeric anthocyanin and the total phenolic content (about 12% and 6%, respectively), but a significant decrease was observed in both parameters immediately after irradiation at 5 kGy. Moreover, irradiation treatment caused a significant decrease in L* value and a significant increase in a* and b* values (P â¤ 0.05); however, changes of color were slight until the dose of 5 kGy. Gamma irradiation up to 2.5 kGy had no significant effect on the concentration of malic, citric and succinic acids, while the level of ascorbic acid decreased significantly at all irradiation doses (0-5 kGy). Cyanidin-3, 5-diglucoside was determined as the major anthocyanin in the jujube fruit studied (about 68%), which was reduced significantly when 5 kGy of irradiation was applied (degradation percentage: 27%). The results demonstrated that vitamins C, B2 and B1 are the most water-soluble vitamins in jujube fruit, respectively. Vitamins C and B1 content significantly decreased at all applied doses (0-5 kGy), whereas B2 content at doses â¤ 2.5 kGy was not significantly affected. The results of this study indicate that gamma irradiation at\n\nMicrowave-assisted extraction of jujube polysaccharide: Optimization, purification and functional characterization.\n\nPubMed\n\nRostami, Hosein; Gharibzahedi, Seyed Mohammad Taghi\n\n2016-06-05\n\nThe operational parameters involved in microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of jujube polysaccharide including microwave power, water to raw material ratio and extraction temperature and time were optimized by RSM. MAE at 400W, 75Â°C, 60 min, using 30 g water/g powdered jujube was the best condition for maximum yield (9.02%) of polysaccharide. Two novel water-soluble polysaccharides (JCP-1 and JCP-2) with average molecular weights of 9.1Ã10(4)-1.5Ã10(5)Da in term of the symmetrical narrow peaks were identified using the analytical purification procedures. The JCP-1 and JCP-2 mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose in molar ratios of 1.4:2.1:4.2:0.9 and 1.2:1.8:4.1:1.1, respectively. The use of 1.5% JCP-1 led to a high emulsifying stability (95.5%) in a model oil-in-water type emulsion with a reduced surface tension (44.1 mN/m) and droplet size (1.32 Î¼m), and an increased apparent viscosity (0.13 Pas) during 21-day cold storage. The antioxidant activities were increased in dose-dependent manners (25-200 Î¼g/mL). Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate tree responses to variation in chill and heat accumulation rates, partial least squares regression was used to correlate first flowering dates of chestnut ( Castanea mollissima Blume) and jujube ( Zizyphus jujube Mill.) in Beijing, China, with daily chill and heat accumulation between 1963 and 2008. The Dynamic Model and the Growing Degree Hour Model were used to convert daily records of minimum and maximum temperature into horticulturally meaningful metrics. Regression analyses identified the chilling and forcing periods for chestnut and jujube. The forcing periods started when half the chilling requirements were fulfilled. Over the past 50 years, heat accumulation during tree dormancy increased significantly, while chill accumulation remained relatively stable for both species. Heat accumulation was the main driver of bloom timing, with effects of variation in chill accumulation negligible in Beijing's cold-winter climate. It does not seem likely that reductions in chill will have a major effect on the studied species in Beijing in the near future. Such problems are much more likely for trees grown in locations that are substantially warmer than their native habitats, such as temperate species in the subtropics and tropics.\n\nChilling and heat requirements for flowering in temperate fruit trees.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuo, Liang; Dai, Junhu; Ranjitkar, Sailesh; Yu, Haiying; Xu, Jianchu; Luedeling, Eike\n\n2014-08-01\n\nClimate change has affected the rates of chilling and heat accumulation, which are vital for flowering and production, in temperate fruit trees, but few studies have been conducted in the cold-winter climates of East Asia.

We investigated the protective effects of wild jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chou) sarcocarp polysaccharides (WJPs) against experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by enabling enhanced intestinal barrier function. Colitis was induced in rats by the intrarectal administration of TNBS. We found that WJPs markedly ameliorated the colitis severity, including less weight loss, decreased disease activity index scores, and improved mucosal damage in colitis rats. Moreover, WJPs suppressed the inflammatory response via attenuation of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6 and MPO activity in colitis rats. And then, to determine the effect of WJPs on the intestinal barrier, we measured the effect of WJPs on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-conjugated dextran permeability in Caco-2 cell stimulation with TNF-Î±. We further demonstrated that the alleviation of WJPs to colon injury was associated with barrier function by assembly of tight junction proteins. Moreover, the effect of WJPs on TER was eliminated by the specific inhibitor of AMPK. AMPK activity was also up-regulated by WJPs in Caco-2 cell stimulation with TNF-Î± and in colitis rats. This study demonstrates that WJPs protect against IBD by enabling enhanced intestinal barrier function involving the activation of AMPK.\n\nComposition and antioxidative and cancer cell inhibiting activities of Jujube fruits and seeds (Ziziphus jujuba) cultivated in Korea\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nJujubes (Chinese dates) have been used as an important plant in folk medicine and shown to exhibit beneficial nutritional and numerous health-promoting effects.

The parameters studied included bioactive compounds (flavan-3-ols and flavonols, identified by LC-PDA-MS, and vitamin C), antioxidant capacity (ABTS and FRAP), and sensory attributes (e.g. hardness, jujube-ID, and sweetness). The best quality of the dried product (high contents of bioactive compounds and high intensity of key sensory attributes) was found in fruits treated by FD and VMD 480-120 W.

The bioactive components have been shown to vary both with cultivar and with growing conditions. Most studies report the components of varieties from China. We measured free amino acid, individual phenolic, and total phenolic content, and antioxidative activities in three jujube fruit pulp extracts from Boeun-deachu, Mechu, and Sanzoin cultivars and two seed extracts (Mechu and Sanzoin) from plants grown in Korea. In g/100 g dry weight, total free amino acid content measured by ion-exchange chromatography ranged from 5.2 to 9.8 in the pulp and from 4.0 to 5.3 in the seed. Total phenolic content measured by Folin-Ciocalteu ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 in the pulp and from 3.6 to 4.6 in the seed. Flavonoids were measured by HPLC and ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 in the pulp and from 3.2 to 4.0 in the seed. Flavonoids were identified by HPLC elution position and UV/vis and mass spectra. Fruits contained the following flavonoids: procyanidin B2, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (Q-3-R), quercetin-3-O-galactoside (Q-3-G), kaempferol-glucosyl-rhamnoside (K-G-R), and two unidentified compounds. Seeds contained the following flavonoids: saponarin, spinosin, vitexin, swertish, 6'''-hydroxybenzoylspinosin (6'''-HBS), 6'''-feruloylspinosin (6'''-FS), and one unidentified substance. Dimensions and weights of the fresh fruit samples affected phenolic content. The distribution of the individual flavonoids among the different samples varied widely. Data determined by the FRAP antioxidative assay were well correlated with total phenolic content. In a departure from other studies, data from the DPPH free radical assay were not correlated with FRAP or with any of the measured compositional parameters. Because individual jujube flavonoids are reported to exhibit different health-promoting effects, knowledge of the composition and concentration of bioactive compounds of jujube products can benefit\n\nUltrasound enhances calcium absorption of jujube fruit by regulating the cellular calcium distribution and metabolism of cell wall polysaccharides.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhi, Huanhuan; Liu, Qiqi; Xu, Juan; Dong, Yu; Liu, Mengpei; Zong, Wei\n\n2017-12-01\n\nUltrasound has been applied in fruit pre-washing processes. However, it is not sufficient to protect fruit from pathogenic infection throughout the entire storage period, and sometimes ultrasound causes tissue damage. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of calcium chloride (CaCl 2 , 10âgâL -1 ) and ultrasound (350âW at 40 kHz), separately and in combination, on jujube fruit quality, antioxidant status, tissue Ca 2+ content and distribution along with cell wall metabolism at 20âÂ°C for 6 days. All three treatments significantly maintained fruit firmness and peel color, reduced respiration rate, decay incidence, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde and preserved higher enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) and non-enzymatic (ascorbic acid and glutathione) antioxidants compared with the control. Moreover, the combined treatment was more effective in increasing tissue Ca 2+ content and distribution, inhibiting the generation of water-soluble and CDTA-soluble pectin fractions, delaying the solubilization of Na 2 CO 3 -soluble pectin and having lower activities of cell wall-modifying enzymes (polygalacturonase and pectate lyase) during storage. These results demonstrated that the combination of CaCl 2 and ultrasound has potential commercial application to extend the shelf life of jujube fruit by facilitating Ca 2+ absorption and stabilizing the cell wall structure.

Tetraploids were obtained at a frequency of over 3% by using 0.05% colchicine (48 h, 72 h) and 0.1% colchicine (24 h, 48 h) treatment as determined by flow cytometry. Cytological and morphological evidence confirmed the results of flow cytometric analysis. The chromosome number of diploid plants was 24 and that of tetraploid plants was 48. The stomata sizes of tetraploid plants were significantly larger than those of diploid plants, while the frequency of stomata were reduced significantly. Similarly, the chloroplast number of guard cells of tetraploid plants increased significantly. The selected tetraploid plants were grafted onto mature trees of Z. jujuba Mill. cv. Zhanhua in the field, resulted in thicker stems, rounder and succulent leaves, larger flowers and a delay in florescence time (3-4 days later) than diploid plants.\n\nZizyphus spina-christi protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmin, Amr; Mahmoud-Ghoneim, Doaa\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe study of chronic hepatic fibrosis has been receiving an escalating attention in the past two decades. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the water extract of Zizyphus spina-christi (L.) (ZSC) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced hepatic fibrosis. ZSC extract was daily administered [alone (ZSC-control group) or along with CCl(4) (protected groups)] at 0.125 (low dose), 0.250 (medium dose) and 0.350 (high dose) g/kg b.wt. for 8 weeks. Histo-pathological, biochemical and histology texture analyses revealed that ZSC significantly impede the progression of hepatic fibrosis. ZSC resulted in a significant amelioration of liver injury judged by the reduced activities of serum ALT and AST. Oral administration of ZSC has also restored normal levels of malondialdehyde and retained control activities of endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, CAT and GSH. Furthermore, ZSC reduced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, the deposition of types I and III collagen in CCl(4)-injured rats. Texture analysis of microscopic images along with fibrosis index calculation showed improvement in the quality of type I collagen distribution and its quantity after administration of ZSC extract. These results demonstrate that administration of ZSC may be useful in the treatment and prevention of hepatic fibrosis.\n\nInvestigation of the antimicrobial activities of Snakin-Z, a new cationic peptide derived from Zizyphus jujuba fruits.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaneshmand, Fatemeh; Zare-Zardini, Hadi; Ebrahimi, Leila\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSnakin-Z is a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that is identified from the fruit of Zizyphus jujuba. This peptide is composed of 31 amino acids which is determined with the sequence of CARLNCVPKGTSGNTETCPCYASLHSCRKYG and molecular weight of 3318.82 Da. Snakin-Z is not identical to any AMP in the peptide database. According to this study, Snakin-Z potentially has antimicrobial property against bacteria and fungi. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of this peptide is suitable for antimicrobial activity. We assessed that Snakin-Z could affect Phomopsis azadirachtae with the MIC value of 7.65 Î¼g/mL and vice versa Staphylococcus aureus with the MIC value of 28.8 Î¼g/mL. Interestingly, human red blood cells also showed good tolerance to the Snakin-Z. On the basis of this study, Snakin-Z can be an appropriate candidate for therapeutic applications in the future due to its antimicrobial property.\n\nOptimization extraction of polysaccharide from Tunisian Zizyphus lotus fruit by response surface methodology: Composition and antioxidant activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMkadmini Hammi, Khaoula; Hammami, Majdi; Rihouey, Christophe; Le Cerf, Didier; Ksouri, Riadh; Majdoub, Hatem\n\n2016-12-01\n\nResponse surface methodology using a Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize extraction temperature, extraction time and ratio of water to material to obtain a maximum polysaccharide yield with high uronic acid content and antioxidant property from edible Zizyphus lotus fruit. The optimal conditions were: extraction time of 3h 15min, extraction temperature of 91.2Â°C and water to solid ratio of 39mL/g. Under these conditions, the experimental extraction yield, uronic acid content and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging ability (IC50) were 18.88%, 41.89 and 0.518mg/mL, respectively. Chemical analysis revealed that the extract was composed of 97.92% carbohydrate of which 41.89% is uronic acid. The extracted polysaccharides, with an average molecular weight of 2720kDa, are composed of arabinose, rhamnose, glucose, fructose, galactose and xylose. Moreover, the polysaccharides exhibited a significant reducing power and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Willd.\n\nPubMed\n\nNesseem, D I; Michel, C G; Sleem, A A; El-Alfy, T S\n\n2009-02-01\n\nThis study deals with the formulation of antihyperglycemic leaf extracts of Zizyphus spina-christi (L.) Willd. A bioactivity guided fractionation of different leaf extracts [defatted ethanol 70% (a), butanol (b), ethanol 70% (c), ethyl acetate (d) and petroleum ether (e) extracts] revealed that extract (c) possessed the highest antihyperglycemic activity followed by (b) and (a). HPLC was adopted for standardization of the extract (c) based on evaluation of the major saponin christinin-A which was used as marker. The detection limit was 9.45 mg/ml for Christinin-A. Extracts (a), (b) and (c) were separately formulated in soft (S) and hard (H) gelatin capsules. Two different formulations (F1 and F2) were tried using different excipients suitable for oral drug delivery. Formula 1, used for soft gelatin capsules [(F1) Sa, Sb, Sc] Formula 2, used for hard gelatin capsules [(F2) - Ha, Hb, Hc]. The recovery rates of the samples of saponin were in the range 99.43-101.86% at 200, 800 microg/ml and 1200 microg/ml. Saponin release rates from different formulae were carried out using dissolution tester USP XXIV. The highest release was obtained from formulation Sc. The release of the extracts followed diffusion mechanism. The selected formula Sc exhibited highest anti-diabetic activity (P < 0.01) on acute and long-term administration and highest saponin release. This formula (Sc) contained poly-oxyethylene (20) cetyl ether (BC-20TX), PEG 400, PEG 6000, purified water, meglyol 810, ascorbic acid and 200 mg of extract (c).\n\nPaenibacillus beijingensis sp. nov., a novel nitrogen-fixing species isolated from jujube garden soil.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Miao; Xie, Lin-qi; Wang, Ya-xiong; Chen, Jian; Xu, Jing; Zhang, Xiao-xia; Sui, Xin-hua; Gao, Jun-lian; Sun, Jian-guang\n\n2012-11-01\n\nA novel Gram-positive, rod-shaped, motile, spore-forming, nitrogen-fixing bacterium, designated strain 7188(T), was isolated from jujube rhizosphere soil in Beijing, China. The strain grew at 4-40Â Â°C and pH 6-12, with an optimum of 30Â Â°C and pH 7.0, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain 7188(T) is a member of the genus Paenibacillus. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain 7188(T) and the type strains of all recognized members of the genus Paenibacillus were below 96Â %. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and C(16:0). The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The DNA G+C content of strain 7188(T) was 60.3Â mol%. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and unknown aminophospholipids. The diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan is meso-diaminopimelic acid. On the basis of these results, strain 7188(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus beijingensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 7188(T) (=ACCC 03082(T)Â =Â DSM 24997(T)).\n\nExploring the Effect of Lactiumâ¢ and Zizyphus Complex on Sleep Quality: A Double-Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\nScholey, Andrew; Benson, Sarah; Gibbs, Amy; Perry, Naomi; Sarris, Jerome; Murray, Greg\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAcute, non-clinical insomnia is not uncommon. Sufferers commonly turn to short-term use of herbal supplements to alleviate the symptoms. This placebo-controlled, double-blind study investigated the efficacy of LZComplex3 (lactiumâ¢, Zizyphus, Humulus lupulus, magnesium and vitamin B6), in otherwise healthy adults with mild insomnia. After a 7-day single-blind placebo run-in, eligible volunteers (n = 171) were randomized (1:1) to receive daily treatment for 2 weeks with LZComplex3 or placebo. Results revealed that sleep quality measured by change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score improved in both the LZComplex3 and placebo groups. There were no significant between group differences between baseline and endpoint on the primary outcome. The majority of secondary outcomes, which included daytime functioning and physical fatigue, mood and anxiety, cognitive performance, and stress reactivity, showed similar improvements in the LZComplex3 and placebo groups. A similar proportion of participants reported adverse events (AEs) in both groups, with two of four treatment-related AEs in the LZComplex3 group resulting in permanent discontinuation. It currently cannot be concluded that administration of LZComplex3 for 2 weeks improves sleep quality, however, a marked placebo response (despite placebo run-in) and/or short duration of treatment may have masked a potential beneficial effect on sleep quality.

The hierarchical titanium phosphate microsphere (HTPM) intermediates consisting of nanoflakes with a thickness of 20 nm were firstly prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. After reacting with diluted NaOH at low temperature and atmospheric pressure, followed by subsequent acid washing and a calcination process, the HTPM intermediates were transformed to TiO2 with the microsphere morphology well retained, while the nanoflakes became porous, and some new nanowires were formed between the nanoflakes. Finally, HTMs consisting of porous nanoflakes and nanowires were obtained. The possible growth mechanisms of HTPMs and HTMs are discussed. The HTMs demonstrate high specific surface area and excellent light-scattering ability. The performance of the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) of the HTMs synthesized under different conditions is studied, and a total conversion efficiency of up to 8.93% was obtained. The improved DSSC performance was attributed to the enhanced dye loading, light-scattering, and charge transporting ability of the HTMs with a unique hierarchical nanostructure.\n\nAlkali-corrosion synthesis and excellent DSSC performance of novel jujube-like hierarchical TiO2 microspheres.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiao, Jiajia; Li, Po; Wen, Xiaogang\n\n2018-04-27\n\nNovel jujube-like hierarchical TiO 2 microspheres (HTMs) were synthesized by an alkali-corrosion process of titanium phosphate (Ti 2 O 3 (H 2 PO 4 ) 2 Â Â·Â 2H 2 O) microspheres.

Three of the Lactobacillus plantarum inoculants (LP1, LP2 or LP3) were used. The DJP was added at rates of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15% of the whole fresh forage. The combination of DJP and inoculants decreased the pH value and ammonia nitrogen content and increased the PC portion. As the DJP ratio increased, there was a peak in lactic acidâ:âacetic acid ratio (12% of DJP ratio) and PB2 fraction (9% of DJP ratio) while the PA content decreased linearly. The LP1 and LP2 had the highest lactic acid content. Inoculants decreased the PB1 portion of true protein. The LP1 treated silage had the highest acetic acid content with the lowest lactic acidâ:âacetic acid ratio and had lower PB3 and PC and higher PB2 than LP2 or LP3 treated silages. The result showed that the application of DJP or inoculants have positive effect on the fermentation, nutrition and N fraction value in the high moisture alfalfa silages, and the combination of DJP and inoculants preserves best.

Physical (weight loss, cooking loss, color and texture), chemical (pH, FFA, PV, TBARS and TVB-N), microbiological (total and psychrotrophic bacterial counts), and sensorial characteristics of BSFs were kinetically analyzed. Preliminary studies showed that the NEs formulated with NEO lower than 5% at all JG concentrations were able to form stable coating solutions owing to the highest short-term stability (>90%) and entrapment efficiency (94.4-98.3%). Edible NE coating formulated with 12% JG and 3.5% NEO as a novel antimicrobial and antioxidant biomaterial exhibited the lowest weight and cooking losses, pH changes, textural and color deterioration, lipid oxidation and microbial growth in BSFs refrigerated over a period of 15days (P<0.05).

Likewise silymarin is popularly used for its potent antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. Stroke being a multifactorial disease with unsatisfactory treatment outcomes, necessitates development of multimodal therapeutic interventions. Thus, we evaluated the therapeutic benefits of herbal combination of Z. jujuba and silymarin in a focal cerebral ischemia model. To evaluate the neuroprotective potential of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujuba (HEZJ) fruit and silymarin alone and in combination in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with HEZJ (100, 250 and 500mg/kg, p.o.) or silymarin (250mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 days prior to induction of MCAo. Neurological deficit score, motor impairment and cerebral infarction were assessed 24h following MCAo. HEZJ (250mg/kg) co-administered with silymarin (250mg/kg) for 3 days prior to induction of MCAo was also evaluated for above parameters and oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the cortex, striatum and hippocampal brain regions were estimated 24h post MCAo. Pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin reduced the neurological deficit score, motor impairment and cerebral infarction volume. HEZJ and silymarin pretreatment also ameliorated the oxidative stress in different brain regions, which was evident from increased SOD levels, decreased MDA and NO levels as compared to MCAo control rats. Interestingly neuroprotective efficacy was potentiated by pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin combination. Pretreatment with HEZJ and silymarin combination was observed to have better neuroprotection mediated via amelioration of oxidative stress in the focal cerebral ischemia model.

A DC voltage is applied to the signal input of the cable and feedback to the control circuit through the signal cable and attenuators. The control circuit adjusts the applied voltage to the cable until the feedback voltage equals the reference voltage. The \"units\" of applied voltage required at the cable input is the system attenuation value of the cable and attenuators, which makes this meter unique. The meter may be used to calibrate data signal cables, attenuators, and cable-attenuator assemblies.\n\n[Characteristics of soil moisture variation in different land use types in the hilly region of the Loess Plateau, China].\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Min; Zhao, Xi Ning; Gao, Xiao Dong; Zhang, Chao; Wu, Pu Te\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSoil water availability is a key factor restricting the ecological construction and sustainable land use in the loess hilly region. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to understand the soil moisture status of different land use types for the vegetation restoration and the effective utilization of land resources in this area. In this study, EC-5 soil moisture sensors were used to continuously monitor the soil moisture content in the 0-160 cm soil profile in the slope cropland, terraced fields, jujube orchard, and grassland during the growing season (from May to October) in the Yuanzegou catchment on the Loess Plateau, to investigate soil moisture dynamics in these four typical land use types. The results showed that there were differences in seasonal variation, water storage characteristics, and vertical distribution of soil moisture under different land use types in both the normal precipitation (2014) and dry (2015) years. The terraced fields showed good water retention capacity in the dry year, with the average soil moisture content of 0-60 cm soil layer in the growing season being 2.6%, 4.2%, and 1.8% higher than that of the slope cropland, jujube orchard, and grassland (all P<0.05). The water storage of 0-160 cm soil profile was 43.90, 32.08, and 18.69 mm higher than that of slope cropland, jujube orchard, and grassland, respectively. In the normal precipitation year, the average soil moisture content of 0-60 cm soil layer in jujube orchard in the growing season was 2.9%, 3.8%, and 4.5% lower than that of slope cropland, terraced fields, and grassland, respectively (all P<0.05). In the dry year, the effective soil water storage of 0-160 cm soil profile in the jujube orchard accounted for 35.0% of the total soil water storage. The grey relational grade between the soil moisture in the surface layer (0-20 cm) and soil moisture in the middle layer (20-100 cm) under different land use types was large, and the trend for the similarity degree of\n\nControl algorithms for dynamic attenuators\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHsieh, Scott S.; Pelc, Norbert J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose: The authors describe algorithms to control dynamic attenuators in CT and compare their performance using simulated scans. Dynamic attenuators are prepatient beam shaping filters that modulate the distribution of x-ray fluence incident on the patient on a view-by-view basis. These attenuators can reduce dose while improving key image quality metrics such as peak or mean variance. In each view, the attenuator presents several degrees of freedom which may be individually adjusted. The total number of degrees of freedom across all views is very large, making many optimization techniques impractical. The authors develop a theory for optimally controlling these attenuators. Special attention is paid to a theoretically perfect attenuator which controls the fluence for each ray individually, but the authors also investigate and compare three other, practical attenuator designs which have been previously proposed: the piecewise-linear attenuator, the translating attenuator, and the double wedge attenuator. Methods: The authors pose and solve the optimization problems of minimizing the mean and peak variance subject to a fixed dose limit. For a perfect attenuator and mean variance minimization, this problem can be solved in simple, closed form. For other attenuator designs, the problem can be decomposed into separate problems for each view to greatly reduce the computational complexity. Peak variance minimization can be approximately solved using iterated, weighted mean variance (WMV) minimization. Also, the authors develop heuristics for the perfect and piecewise-linear attenuators which do not require a priori knowledge of the patient anatomy. The authors compare these control algorithms on different types of dynamic attenuators using simulated raw data from forward projected DICOM files of a thorax and an abdomen.

A general formulation of tracer attenuation in groundwater is presented. Basic sensitivities of attenuation to macrodispersion and retention are illustrated for a few typical retention mechanisms. Tracer recovery is suggested as an experimental proxy for attenuation. Unique experimental data of tracer recovery in crystalline rock compare favorably with the theoretical model that is based on diffusion-controlled retention. Non-Fickian hydrodynamic transport has potentially a large impact on field-scale attenuation of dissolved contaminants.\n\nVariable laser attenuator\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFoltyn, Stephen R.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe disclosure relates to low loss, high power variable attenuators comprng one or more transmissive and/or reflective multilayer dielectric filters.

This type of lamellar duplex microstructure influences attenuation because of the lamellar spacing. In addition, longitudinal attenuation measurements were conducted using an unfocused transducer with 10 MHz central frequency on the cross section of a quenched railroad wheel sample. The dependence of longitudinal attenuation on the pearlite microstructure is observed from the changes of longitudinal attenuation from the quenched tread surface to deeper locations. The results show that the attenuation value is lowest and relatively constant within the quench depth, then increases linearly. The experimental results demonstrate a reasonable agreement with results from the theoretical model. Ultrasonic attenuation provides an important non-destructive method to evaluate duplex microstructure within grains which can be implemented for quality control in conjunction with other manufacturing processes.

Finally, similar plasma thickness for a specific signal attenuation can have different plasma properties.Â«Â less\n\nLanding gear noise attenuation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMoe, Jeffrey W. (Inventor); Whitmire, Julia (Inventor); Abeysinghe, Amal (Inventor); Kwan, Hwa-Wan (Inventor)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA landing gear noise attenuator mitigates noise generated by airframe deployable landing gear. The noise attenuator can have a first position when the landing gear is in its deployed or down position, and a second position when the landing gear is in its up or stowed position. The noise attenuator may be an inflatable fairing that does not compromise limited space constraints associated with landing gear retraction and stowage. A truck fairing mounted under a truck beam can have a compliant edge to allow for non-destructive impingement of a deflected fire during certain conditions.\n\nAttenuation in gas-charged magma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCollier, L.; Neuberg, J. W.; Lensky, N.; Lyakhovsky, V.; Navon, O.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nLow frequency seismic events observed on volcanoes, such as Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, are thought to be caused by a resonating system. The modelling of seismic waves in gas-charged magma is critical for the understanding of seismic resonance effects in conduits, dykes and cracks. Seismic attenuation, which depends mainly on magma viscosity, gas and crystal content, is an essential factor in such modelling attempts. So far only two-phase gas-melt systems with the assumption of no diffusion and transport of volatiles between the melt and the gas bubbles have been considered. In this study, we develop a method of quantifying attenuation within gas-charged magma, including the effects of diffusion and exsolution of gas into the bubbles. The results show that by including such bubble growth processes attenuation levels are increased within magma. The resulting complex behaviour of attenuation with pressure and frequency indicates that two factors are controlling attenuation, the first due to viscous hindrance or the melt, and the second due diffusion processes. The level of attenuation within a gas-charged magma conduit suggests an upper limit on the length of a resonating conduit section of just a few hundred meters.\n\nEffects of water collection and mulching combinations on water infiltration and consumption in a semiarid rainfed orchard\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Hongchen; Zhao, Xining; Gao, Xiaodong; Ren, Kemeng; Wu, Pute\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSoil water and its efficient use are critical to sustainable productivity of rainfed orchards under the context of climate change in water-limited areas. Here, we combined micro-catchments for collecting hillslope runoff, named fish-scale pits, with mulches to examine water infiltration and water consumption of fruit trees using in situ soil moisture monitoring, the micro-lysimeter and sap flow methods via a two-year experiment in a rainfed jujube orchard on China's Loess Plateau. This experiment included four treatments: fish-scale pit with branch mulching (FB), fish-scale pit with straw mulching (FS), fish-scale pit without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). The results showed that only about 50% of the rainfall infiltrated the soil for CK during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The fish-scale pit without mulching experienced significantly increased rainfall infiltration by 41.38 and 27.30%, respectively, but also increased evaporation by 42.28 and 65.59%, respectively, compared to CK during the two growing seasons. The jujube transpiration significantly increased by 45.64-53.10% over CK, and the evaporation decreased by 42.47-53.50% when fish-scale pits were mulched with branches or straw. Taken together, the results show that the fish-scale pits and mulching combinations efficiently increased rainfall infiltration and jujube evapotranspiration in the experimental jujube orchard. The findings here provide an insight into the field water management for hillslope orchards in water-limited regions.\n\nAdjustable Optical-Fiber Attenuator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuzzetti, Mike F.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nAdjustable fiber-optic attenuator utilizes bending loss to reduce strength of light transmitted along it.

However, the lack of well-established methodology for MR-based attenuation correction is hampering further development and wider acceptance of this technology. We assess the impact of ignoring bone attenuation and using different tissue classes for generation of the attenuation map on the accuracy of attenuation correction of PET data. This wor"
