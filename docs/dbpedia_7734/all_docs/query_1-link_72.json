        "text": "Stories and facts\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), located in Kumasi, Ashanti region, Ghana, is a renowned public institution focusing on science and technology education. Commonly known as UST, Tech, or Kwame Tech, it stands as the second public university established in Ghana and the largest in the Ashanti Region.\n\nThe origins of KNUST trace back to the visionary ambitions of Agyeman Prempeh I, a ruler of the Ashanti Kingdom, who sought to establish a university in Kumasi as part of modernizing the kingdom. Although his plans were thwarted by the British empire's expansion, his successor, King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh II, pursued this vision. The establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast in the 1940s, coupled with the 1948 Accra riots and the subsequent Watson Commission report, further propelled the establishment of a science university in Kumasi.\n\nIn 1949, construction began on what was initially named the Kumasi College of Technology. By 1951, the college admitted its first students to the engineering faculty, formally becoming the Kumasi College of Technology under an Act of Parliament in 1952. It grew rapidly and achieved full university status in 1961, named Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in honor of Ghana's first Prime Minister and President.\n\nToday, KNUST spans an impressive 2,512.96 acres, with its main campus located about eight miles east of Kumasi. The university has evolved its organizational structure, transitioning into a collegiate system in 2005. Under this system, faculties are consolidated into six colleges, each semi-autonomous in its operations.\n\nKNUST is not just a hub for academic pursuits but also offers comprehensive housing and accommodation facilities to cater to students' diverse needs. The campus boasts six halls of residence, managed by dedicated hall councils.\n\nAcademically, KNUST is structured into various colleges, including Agriculture and Natural Resources, Health Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Engineering, and Science. Additionally, the university has embraced technology, with the Institute of Distance Learning offering flexible education options.\n\nThe university's commitment to research is evident through its numerous research centers, such as the Bureau of Integrated Research and Development and the Kumasi Center for Collaborative Research.\n\nIn terms of media presence, KNUST hosts Focus FM, its official radio station, and TEK TV, its television station, both enriching campus life and facilitating community engagement.\n\nKNUST has garnered global recognition, consistently ranking as the top university in Ghana and West Africa by U.S. News & World Report. Its academic excellence is further underscored by accolades such as winning the Pan African Universities Debate Championship and the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition multiple times.\n\nWith a distinguished list of alumni, including notable figures like Kofi Annan and Aliu Mahama, KNUST continues to shape Africa's intellectual landscape and contribute significantly to global education and research endeavors."
