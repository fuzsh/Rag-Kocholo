        "text": "The IMG has encouraged the development of local committees for the Ralph Bunche commemoration in six cities that played a significant role in Bunche's life. These are cities where he spent significant time and had experiences that influenced his development and maturity as a statesmen of historic accomplishments. These legacy cities are: Detroit, where he was born on August 7, 1903 and spent his early childhood; Albuquerque, where he moved in 1915; Los Angeles, where he was raised, developed his basic academic skills at UCLA (B.A. 1927), and began showing signs of brilliance as a student and athlete and initially articulated his interest in public service; Cambridge/Boston, where he excelled in his graduate studies at Harvard University (M.A. 1928; Ph.D. 1934) and began to more fully develop and hone his academic skills; Washington, D.C., where he organized and chaired the political science department at Howard University (1929-1941) where he manifested his prowess as a scholar-activist, and later began his service in the Office of Strategic Services (1941-1944) and in the State Department (1944-1946); and New York City, where the impact of his contributions and service took on legendary proportions through his work at the United Nations (from 1949 to his death in 1971).\n\nBack to Top\n\nBoston, Ralph Bunche Centenary Planning Committee\n\nBoston University\n\nThe African American Studies Program and the International History Institute at Boston University have jointly sponsored a conference Ralph Bunche and the American Experience. The conference was held on March 19, 2004 and celebrated the centennial of the birth of distinguished diplomat and civil right leader Ralph J. Bunche. The conference was open by Ronal K. Richardson, Director of African American Studies and by Dennis Berkey, Provost of Boston University.\n\nThe morning panel was on The American Dilemma: Ralph Bunche as Activist and it was chaired by Ronald K. Richardson. Benjamin Rivlin talked on Ralph Bunche: the Man and His Time, Cedric Robinson on Ralph Bunche and The American Dilemma, Ronald Walters on Ralph Bunche and Civil Rights.\n\nThe afternoon panel The International Dilemma: Ralph Bunche as Diplomat was chaired by William R.

Further details are underway.\n\nSimmons College and Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University: Plans for participation are underway.\n\n.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDetroit, Ralph Bunche Centenary Planning Committee\n\nThe year 2003 will be the 100th anniversary of the birth in Detroit of the distinguished American diplomat and Nobel Prize winner Dr. Ralph Bunche. Dr. Bunche personified the quest for understanding and peacemaking among the world's people, skills sorely in demand in these difficult times of international misunderstanding and hatred. In his monumental work, after a career in higher education and pioneering in the U.S. civil rights struggle, Dr. Bunche went on to mediate the first Arab-Israeli ceasefire accords in 1949 and then to represent the United Nations as Under-Secretary General in the numerous crises arising from the de-colonization process, including those of the Congo.\n\nThe Detroit Centenary Planning Committee is chaired by Frederic Pearson, who heads the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit . The Detroit Committee, in order to manage the celebrations, is divided into three working sub-committees that deal respectively with: school based commemoration, community celebrations, and a scholarly event on campus.\n\nAs a leadoff to the national Bunche commemorations in Los Angeles , Washington ,DC, Boston , and New York , the Detroit Committee intends to promote Bunche Commemoration programming directly among citizens and neighborhood groups both to revive and celebrate Dr. Bunche legacy as one of its greatest citizens. The kickoff community observance in the fall of 2003 will feature a screening of the award winning documentary \"Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey\" together with a musical concert. The concert will be held on October 25 and will take place at the Episcopal Church of St. Paul in Detroit and will include performances by the WSU Chorale, the WSU Band and the Mosaic Youth theater. Among the musical selections will be a “Cantata for the United Nations” and “The Mystery of Man,” a jazz rendition of early peace poetry by Pope John II. Ronald Palmer, distinguished former ambassador, will be giving the keynote address of the evening. Four Peacemakers awards will be awarded to members of the metropolitan community who have shown exemplary skills in the areas of conflict resolution and the promotion of peace.\n\nDuring the anniversary year groups throughout metro Detroit will conduct activities appropriate to Dr. Bunche's achievements and skills to perpetuate the effect of his legacy in future years. Group observance also will include a Ralph Bunche Weekend of commemorations among religious congregations through the metropolitan area, led by activities at Detroit s famed Second Baptist Church where the Bunche family worshiped and where Dr. Bunche was baptized in 1927. The Ralph Bunche Weekend also will involve the Council of Baptist Pastors, the Christian Communication Council, and Jewish Community Council, and Islamic and Arab organizations.\n\nThe Wayne State University Center for Peace and Conflict Studies will launch an educational initiative for todays youth and their families, both to acquaint them with Dr. Bunches legacy, and to offer skill building in the very pursuits that made Dr. Bunche one of our greatest citizens. Specifically it proposes to hold the first Ralph Bunche Summer Institute for educators, students, and parents.\n\nThe Summer Institute will be a week-long event from June 16-20, 2003. The Institute will be available for academic credit both at the high school and university levels, and will include participants from diverse school districts across Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties.\n\nOver the week, the Institute will first present the award winning feature documentary “Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey,” which gives a compelling portrait of Dr. Bunche’s lifetime struggles and achievements, in a historical context that spanned the twentieth century. Teachers will be acquainted with the related classroom materials and modules now available, as well as new ones for teaching about Africa as a key world region (Dr. Bunche’s life study was on African colonialism). From the film we will also develop workshops for the participants on the fascinating psychological, social, and political issues raised in overcoming obstacles in a climb to eminence. The workshops will be followed by in-depth facilitated inter-cultural dialogue among participants—separately for youth and parents—from the diverse school districts represented at the Institute. From this dialogue we will then proceed to skill building sessions in mediation and negotiation in the Bunche tradition. The Institute’s first phase will conclude with a Model United Nations simulation exercise in conjunction with local United Nations Associations.\n\nAfter this unique set of educational experiences, which will equip participants to better deal with issues of diversity at home and public policy dilemmas across the world, a second phase will commence during the summer with the Center’s assistance in maintaining participants’ communication and mutual understanding through on-line chat rooms and a list-serve. At the same time we will conduct a multi-media contest for presentations about Dr. Bunche and his legacy, including essays, oratory, theatrical, musical, artistic, poetic and literary entries. These will be collected in the Fall of 2003, and will be presented at the community Bunche keynote events being planned for the rest of the year. Thus there will be lasting outcomes to the Bunche commemoration, including a Ralph Bunche Peace Scholarship at the Center and Wayne State University.\n\nIf the programs are of interest and you want to participate, please contact Dr. Frederic Pearson at 313-577-3453 or email ab3440@wayne.edu. If you would like to serve on the Ralph Bunche Education or Community Committee, or need additional information, please contact Steven Durant at 313-577-6787 or email sdurant2001@aol.com.\n\nTo make this observance and programming possible at this most crucial time in our nation’s history, The Detroit Ralph Bunche Centenary Planning Committee hopes for key financial donations from those interested in providing alternatives to violence, better international awareness, and positive role models for today’s youth and families. Contributors would be featured prominently in sponsorship acknowledgments. Among the specific projects requiring financial support would be:\n\n• Support for a keynote speaker of the highest national and international stature.\n\n• Coordination of the Ralph Bunche Weekend observances.\n\n• The Ralph Bunche Peacemaker Scholarship.\n\n• Staging of an inspirational and lively concert.\n\nThus we invite interested participants and sponsors to contact the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies to learn of the options for providing support and gaining metro- and nation-wide recognition.\n\nWe can be reached online at ab3440@wayne.edu, through our website http://www.pcs.wayne.edu/, by phone at 313-577-8268, and by post at 2320 Faculty Administration, WSU, Detroit , MI 48202 .\n\nBack to Top\n\nActivities That Have Taken Place:\n\n• December 6, 2001 - Jefferson High School Assembly honoring Dr. Bunche.\n\n• December 7, 2001 - Community celebration of Ralph Bunche at the Dunbar Hotel.\n\n• April 2002 - The Jefferson High School administrative building was renamed the Dr. Ralph J.

The International Institute is also hosting a Summer Institute for teachers on UN conflict resolution, and the focus for next summer’s institute could be on the contributions and life work of Ralph Bunche.\n\nThe National Center for History in the Schools is developing a five-lesson curriculum unit on the life and achievements of Ralph Bunche to serve students in World History (Grade 10), U.S. History (Grade 11), and Civics (Grade 12). This curriculum can be used to supplement the study of race relations in the 1920s and 1930s, World War II, the Arab Israeli conflict, postwar decolonization, the Cold War, and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The project could be completed by March 2003 and ready for the 2003-04 school year. All of these K-12 projects will be coordinated with the “Successor Generation” Program that is being created by the Washington, DC Bunche Centenary Committee together with the Phelps-Stokes Fund, and with the National Centenary Committee.\n\nThe office of Community Relations at UCLA is planning to involve the youth of Los Angeles in the commemoration of Ralph Bunche.

Bunche Center brought together leading scholars of the last 10 years on the collaboration of Ralph Bunche and Gunnar Myrdal.\n\n2004 marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy , an investigation into American race relations, conducted by Myrdal as principal investigator, and Ralph Bunche (then chairman of Howard University's Political Science department) as chief collaborator. In An American Dilemma Myrdal documents the conditions under which Americans of African descent lived during the first half of the twentieth century. His study offered scholars and political leaders useful evidence of the enduring effects of slavery and racism, and has inspired much analysis and intellectual debate in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nRalph Bunche and Gunnar Myrdal were also remarkable human beings. In 1950, Bunche won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work as a United Nations diplomat on the Arab-Israeli conflict in the early years of the state of Israel . Myrdal shared the 1974 Nobel Prize with Friedrich August von Hayek for (according to the Nobel Committee) his \"penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.\" In 1982 Myrdal's wife Alva won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in UN disarmament negotiations and activism to promote disarmament.\n\nThe Myrdal's and Bunche have also been the subjects of fascinating biographical studies. There has been lively scholarly debate about the intersection of their personal lives and commitment to progressive causes. For example, Bunche's ideological position at the time of his collaboration with Myrdal has been depicted as that of a \"vulgar Marxist\" in contrast to Myrdal's perspective of viewing the American racial problem as one of caste rather than class. There is also the problem of interpreting the kinds of transformations both Myrdal and Bunche made in their later lives. Bunche went from being considered a radical during the time of his association with Myrdal to being all but tossed aside during the civil rights upheavals of the 1960s. From studying inequality at the national level Myrdal went on to study international inequality and development. Bunche became perhaps the best-known African-American diplomat of the 20th century despite never having served as an ambassador for the US State Department. Myrdal is now considered by some to be the greatest of all Swedish social scientists.\n\nThe symposium consisted of four panels - two in the morning and two in the afternoon. Panel 1 brought together scholars who have produced biographies (books and video) on Ralph Bunche. Panel 2 featured critical presentations and exchanges between scholars who have been engaged in interpreting and re-interpreting the work that went into producing An American Dilemma. Panel 3 explored the question of race and its impact on Bunche's diplomatic career. Titled \"An American Dilemma - Sixty Years Later\", Panel 4 examined Bunche and Myrdal's contributions to the study of the ecology of social theory in the United States.\n\nThe detailed program can be found in the attached pdf file.\n\n• UCLA’s African Studies Center and Globalization Research Center-Africa will host a Spring, 2004 conference on Bunche’s tremendous impact on the decolonization of Africa.\n\nThe conference, \"Trustee for the Human Community\": Ralph Bunche and the Decolonization of Africa,\" will be held on June3-4, 2004, and is organized by the Marcus Garvey Papers Project and the Globalization Research Center-Africa under the auspices of the James. S. Coleman African Studies Center.
