        "text": "University of Ghana, Legon had its first ever female Chancellor by the name of Mary Chinery-Hesse in 2018 after the passing of Kofi Annan, a former UN General Secretary\n\nProfessor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang was also the first woman to ever become vice-chancellor of a university in Ghana in 2008\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology appointed its first female Vice-Chancellor, Rita Akosua Dickson, in 2020\n\nWomen have proven over the years that they can excel in any field as long as they are given equal opportunities as their male counterparts.\n\nThe University of Cape Coast made significant history when it trusted and elected its first female Vice-Chancellor to run the institution's affairs. Since then, many tertiary institutions have learned and followed suit.\n\nYEN.com.gh seeks to introduce some of the tenacious Ghanaian women whose hard work and brilliance spoke for them and were given the opportunity to hold topmost positions at the various universities in Ghana.\n\n1. Mary Chinery-Hesse, first female Chancellor of the University of Ghana\n\nShe succeeded former UN General Secretary Kofi Annan as the Chancellor of the University of Ghana on August 1, 2018. This made her the first woman to hold the position.\n\nBefore her appointment, Mary was the vice-chairperson of the National Development Planning Commission and a member of the Centre for Policy Analysis board. She also worked with the United Nations (UN) and became the first-ever African woman appointed as the Resident Coordinator of the UN Systems and Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nHer career took another turn when she became the first-ever woman Deputy Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the first African woman to attain the position of Under-Secretary-General in the history of the United Nations.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech at her swearing-in ceremony as Chancellor of the University of Ghana, Madam Mary made an assurance to help return the university to its former glory with her gathered experiences.\n\n\"I insist that a chancellor should not be just a ceremonial face but also an unseen lead advocate. I promise not to simply make myself available for ceremonial events and handshakes at graduations.\n\nLike my predecessors have done, I promise to put all the skills I hold from the school of life and the extensive network I've developed in the process at the disposal of the University of Ghana\", she said.\n\nMary Chinery-Hesse had her secondary education at Wesley Girls’ High School and Mfantsipim School. She continued to the University of Ghana, where she earned a Sociology and Economics degree. In addition, Mary had a postgraduate degree in Development Economics at the University of Dublin and at the World Bank Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1991, she became the first female alumnus of the University of Ghana to be awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws.\n\nMary Chinery-Hesse was married to Lebrecht James Nii Tettey Chinery-Hesse. He was a lawyer, a civil servant, and a diplomat. He worked as a legislative drafting expert for Uganda, Ghana, Zambia, and Sierra Leone. He previously served as Ghana's acting attorney general and solicitor general. Lebrecht, unfortunately, passed on on August 30, 2018, at the age of 88.\n\nThe two had a son, Herman Kojo Chinery-Hesse, a technology entrepreneur and the founder of theSOFTtribe, the oldest and largest software company in Ghana. He is popularly known as the Bill Gates of Africa.\n\n2. Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, first Vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Coast\n\nIn 2008, Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang made history when she became the first-ever female vice-chancellor in Ghana. She functioned in the role for four years.\n\nPrior to her appointment, she taught at the University of Cape Coast from 1986 as a professor of Literature and held various positions such as Head of the Department of English, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Dean of the Board of Graduate Studies and Founding Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and Research.\n\nJane Naana Opoku-Agyemang also has a very active political background. She served as the Minister of Education in Ghana from 2013 to 2017, appointed by the then president John Dramani Mahama.\n\nShe also became the first female presidential running mate for the National Democratic Congress flagbearer. The official declaration was made in 2020\n\nSpeaking at her outdooring ceremony as the NDC running mate. Professor Naana applauded all who made her selection possible and for respecting women in the country and allowing them to hold such positions.\n\n\"The women of Ghana will not forget. The youth will remember. Generations to come will commit your decision to memory and make it a reference point. We will partner with our men and youth as we've always have done and work hard to achieve peace in our land because that is the best way to respond to this high recognition\", she said in an interview.\n\nShe also stated that being the first in history to become a female running mate is gratifying but what really matters is holding the door open for those behind and creating other avenues for self-actualization for many more.\n\nProfessor Naana is a product of Wesley Girls' Senior High School and acquired her bachelor's degree in English and French from the University of Cape Coast. She continued to the University of Dakar for a diploma in Advanced Studies in French and got a master's and a doctorate from York University, Canada.\n\nThe historic Ghanaian woman has three children; Kweku Opoku-Agyemang, who has a PhD in Economics from the University of Wisconsin, Kwabena Opoku-Agyemang, a graduate of West Virginia University, and Adwoa Opoku-Agyemang, sa doctorate holder in English Literature and Comparative Literature.\n\n3.

This made her the first woman in the history of the Faculty to be appointed Dean.\n\nProfessor Rita Akosua Dickson's record of 'firsts' continued when she became KNUST's first female Pro-vice chancellor in October 2018.\n\nDuring her address as the newest Vice-chancellor of KNUST madam Rita admitted that she had no idea she would one day be in a leadership position at her alma mater.\n\n\"When I first step foot on this campus in 1990 to commence my undergraduate studies, it never crossed my mind that a day like this would come when I, Akosua would stand before this august gathering in this hall and the many more who have joined us via various virtual platforms as the Vice-chancellor of this university. It is indeed very true that with God, all things are possible\", she said.\n\nShe shared her vision for KNUST as one of its leaders and admonished all gathered to buy into it for it to become a reality.\n\n\"My vision is to position KNUST as a competitive global research intensive institution for the advancement in science and technology for industrial and social uptake towards sustainable national and global development\"\n\nMadam Rita started her secondary education at St. Monica's Secondary School and completed at Wesley Girls' High School.

It has taken us awhile, seven decades and three years. Other public universities when ahead of us in this advancement in gender equality but when the university of Ghana did it, we did it in a comprehensive style.\"\n\nThe UG vice-chancellor also opened up about her mother and late father's role in her life, which has gotten her thus far.\n\n\"I thank my parents for bringing me up to make me believe I can achieve whatever I dreamt of. Dad, you missed this day, but I'm positive that you're beaming with smiles from heaven, and you're the proudest dad ever. Mum, you taught me the attributes of resilience, forte and forthrightness, and you live by these\", she said.\n\nAfter having her secondary education at Holy Child School and Archbishop Porter Girls' Secondary School, Professor Nana Aba Appiah Amfo proceeded to the University of Ghana to pursue a degree in French and Linguistics in 1991.
