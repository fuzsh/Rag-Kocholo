        "text": "TEDxChange 2013 is a TEDx event co-organized by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and TED. Convened by Melinda French Gates and hosted by Chris Anderson, TEDxChange will focus on issues surrounding global health and development. TEDxChange type events are TEDx events hosted around the live webcast of TEDxChange, and also feature dynamic local speakers. Our event is called TEDxKNUSTChange, and is one of many TEDx events happening around the globe on April 3rd that will expand on the ideas brought up at TEDxChange 2013.\n\nDisruption is usually unwelcome. It represents conflict, chaos, and potential danger. We discourage disruptive behavior in our homes and our societies, often favoring passivity and compliance.\n\nBut disruption can be a positive – sometimes vital – catalyst for change. It can challenge old assumptions, ignite conversations, activate authorities and expose new possibilities. Disruption can shed a unique light on difficult issues, giving a fresh urgency and perspective to the challenges of our global community.\n\nTo solve the most intractable challenges in health and development, we need positive disruption. It is the path to true progress."
