        "text": "Junior Chamber International, a network for young entrepreneurs and business people has expanded into Harrogate.\n\nPast members of JCI include Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton and Bill Gates andhas 250,000 active members in over 100 countries.\n\nThe JCI organisation is for business people aged between 18-40 and operates a range of business-based training and projects.\n\nJCI provides young people with the opportunity to “develop their leadership skills, social responsibility, entrepreneurship and fellowship necessary to create positive change.”\n\nPresident Michael Best was at the second meeting , when four brand new members stepped up to take part in a speaking competition.\n\nHe said: “The event is typical of many which JCI runs, allowing members to use the experience to develop the skill to think quickly- which can prove extremely important and many business and personal situations.\n\n“We originally thought of this as more of an entertaining evening, whereby a couple of established members and I would speak, and give tips on speaking as part of a social evening.\n\n“We then gave the new members the chance to have a go. Imagine my absolute surprise (and delight!) when four of them did. They were all brilliant too!\n\n“Kit was commented that that many well established JCI members find off the cuff speaking a great challenge, so for four members at only their second meeting to push themselves was amazing!”\n\nThe next meeting, on 11th March at 6.30 pm, will take place at the Old Swan Hotel in Harrogate, which has offered the use of its facilities in order to support the development of JCI in Harrogate."
