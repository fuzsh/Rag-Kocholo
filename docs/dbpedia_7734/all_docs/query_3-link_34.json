Macalester was an exciting place … The lessons I picked up here stayed with me throughout my career and my life.”\n\nAt both events, Annan said he finds hope in young people, citing the high school students who took to the streets in March to protest for changes in gun laws.\n\n“I have believed for a long time, and I’ve repeated it time and again, that you’re never too young to lead,” he said at the University Club.\n\nOriginally Published: May 7, 2018 at 10:00 p.m."
