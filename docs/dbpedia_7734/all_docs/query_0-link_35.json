        "text": "Reminiscences of Adisadel\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nSCHOLARSHIP AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nIt is a tradition dating back to the late 1920s for the School to organise yearly competitive examinations among the senior students, generally the Fifth and Sixth Formers so as to test their intelligence and knowledge of the major subjects taught at the School. The winners of the competitions in such disciplines as the Classics, Greek, Mathematics and English are acclaimed scholars in those particular fields of study and their names are inscribed in special scrolls provided for the purposes. The scrolls bearing the individual names of all the winners each year are displayed in the School Assembly Hall.\n\nOriginally, the special prizes were the Hamlyn Greek Prize, the Hare's Classics Prize, the Fisher's Mathematics Prize, the Dyce-Sharpe Essay Prize and the \"Victores Laudorum\", for those students who display prowess or exceptional qualities in the field of sports. The Hamlyn Greek Prize has now been replaced by \"The Science Prize\", the Classics Prize by the \"French Prize\". The Dyce-Sharpe Essay Prize has become simply the \"English Prize\". Naturally, there were then as now keen rivalry among the senior students in the Fifth and Sixth Forms for those special prizes which have the effect of immortalising one's name as a \"Scholar\" in so far as one's special field of achievement is concerned.\n\nIt was something of a feat to be able to win even one of those glittering prizes of the School, more so, to be a double prize-winner. Of course, the winning of such prizes at one and the same time, or on other occasions, has not been beyond the capabilities of brighter students' of the School. For example, in 1935, the School's Silver Jubilee Year, one `brainy' sixth form student - J. A. Boateng - achieved the rare distinction of winning the three main prizes of the School, namely, the Hamlyn Greek, the Hare's Classics and the Fisher's Mathematics Prizes in a row, thus, setting an all-time record that is distinctive and stands, in a class by itself.\n\nIn the following year 1936, a fifth form student, G. M. Pitcher, caused quite a flutter in the sixth-form dovecot when he won the coveted Hare's Classics Prize, before then the monopoly of the sixth formers, and went on to improve upon his academic performances by winning again the Hare's Classics prize together with the Hamlyn Greek prize the following year, 1937. Pitcher's academic brilliance was enhanced by the fact that he had a capacity for leadership as well. He was also the Head Prefect of the School for 1937.\n\nOther students who won three prizes at one and the same time, apart from J.A. Boateng mentioned above include, J. H. Sackey (1945) and M.J. Anaman (1956) both of whom won the Classics. Greek and English Prizes. W.E. Abraham (1951) took the Classics, Mathematics and English Prizes. C.C. Lokko (1946) won the Classics and the Greek Prizes in addition to the \"Top of Form (Sixth Form) Prize and becoming the \"Scholar of the Year\".\n\nRobert K. A. Gardiner (1934) took the Classics and the Dyce-Sharpe Essay Prizes, and Ebenezer Laing (1948) the Mathematics and the English Prizes. B. C. L. Odei (1941) and J.A.K. Quartey (1943) won both the Classics and the Mathematics Prizes, while l. R. Aboagye (1952) collected the Greek and Mathematics Prizes. Earlier in 1930, C. E. Graves who had won the Prize for Classics went on to win the Mathematics Prizes in 1931. Similarly, Albert Hammond took the Greek Prize in 1931 and that for Mathematics in 1932. A. A. Y. Kyerematen won the Dyce-Sharpe Essay Prize for two years running in 1935 and 1936.\n\nThe Latin and Greek scholars (i.e. those students who won both the Hare's Classics and Hamlyn Greek Prizes at the same time) include, apart from J. A. Boateng (1935), G. M. Pitcher (1936-37) and C. C. Lokko (1946) mentioned above, S. E. Grant (1940) C. K. Annan (1942) P, E. Archer (1944) J. H. Sackey (1945) J. M. A. Sackeyfio (1948) E. A. B. Mayne (1949) M. J. Anaman (1956) I. J. Kumi (1957) G. Adeleye (1958) and S. G. Amoo (1960).\n\nIn the competitions, organised under the new \"dispensation\", N. T. Quao (1958) J. T. Anim (1959) and S. N. Assimeh (1964) were winners of both the Science and French Prizes. G. A. Wilson-Tagoe (1957) and K. A. Sampson (1967) took both the English and French Prizes.\n\nMathematics was a subject that proved to be difficult to tackle for many of us at school then. But there was one particular student, A. M. L.. Taylor, who was great in that subject, for he had a knack for solving difficult and abtruse mathematical problems and riddles with the ease of a duck taking to water! `Attu' as he was affectionately called, won the Fisher's Mathematics Prize in grand style in 1938. So was J. Aggrey-Mensah who took the prize in 1958. (The names of winners of the various prizes of the School are listed in the Appendix VI)\n\nThe original prizes, it should be noted, were named after the Founder and the earlier headmasters of the School, who specialised in the subjects in question. The donor of the English Essay Prize, Dr. N. A. Dyce-Sharpe, was an expatriate Medical Officer of Health in charge of the Cape Coast Hospital in the 1930's. He was a popular figure in the social life of the town and besides being a friend and benefactor of the School, he took keen interest in its progress and in the welfare of the students.\n\nThe changes in the nomenclatures of the prizes were necessitated by circumstances, so as to reflect the needs of the changing times, though the underlying objectives for the institution of the prizes remain essentially the same.\n\nNaturally, to most senior students of the School, in our days those prized laurels were well worth striving for; and to be able to will one or more of those prizes was the ambition of many a student who aspired to be a scholar of the School. As should be expected, in my last year at the School, along with my class-mates. I entered the competition for the Hare's Classics Prize, as I seemed then to have developed a flair for the Classics. With the idea of winning the Prize in view, I worked hard, hoping that I would achieve that aim. But much as I tried hard. I could not succeed for we, the other prize aspirants, were beaten by a fellow class-mate, who seemed to have been born with a `golden spoon' in his mouth and had Classics (and Greek too!) at his fingertips! That lucky fellow is now the distinguished Judge of Appeal Â– Mr. Justice P.E.N.K. Archer, LLB. (Hons) who is also Chairman of the Law Reform Commission and of the Archer Committee on the Cocoa Marketing Board! And so ended my last determined but unsuccessful bid to win the coveted Classics Prize, inspired by the motto of the School House-Quaque-to which I belonged: Pugnate Summa Vi!\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nFruits of Education\n\nAristotle once said that \"the roots of education are bitter but the fruits are sweet\". The close application to studies and purposeful research, often tiresome and laborious and the successes and achievements of many Old Boys of Adisadel in many fields, over the years justify this axiomatic truth. Thanks to the experiences and skills as well as the efficiency and successes of the past students; Adisadel has maintained a tradition of scholarship of a high order, that inspires confidence and gives satisfaction not only to the Old Boys themselves but also to the School. In the field of sports, the reputation of Adisadel is, of course proverbial.\n\nAt the beginning, the School prepared candidates for the London College of Preceptors Examinations, in which the few existing secondary schools in British West Africa, including Mfantsipim (their Richmond College) the oldest secondary school for boys in this country, took part. These were in three stages-Preliminary, Junior and Senior and were taken at six-monthly intervals at the least. In those examinations the School then known as S.P.G. Grammar School, did extremely well, setting, at the first shot, a record for West Africa that stood the test of time.\n\nThe College of Preceptors Examinations eventually gave way to the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examinations conducted by the Cambridge Examinations Syndicate. The examinations were held in two stages, the Junior Cambridge Examinations and the Senior Cambridge School Leaving Certificate Examinations. The former was intended mainly for candidates in the Fourth Form and served as a prelude to the latter which were taken by students in the Sixth Form at the end of the Secondary School career. Similarly, candidates presented by the School in those examinations excelled themselves and several records were set in various subjects particularly in the classics. The School thus built up an enormous reputation for the classics; and indeed Adisadel became famous for the outstanding classical scholars it produced in the country.\n\nRecords\n\nIt is interesting to recall that in 1925, a remarkable student of the School - Mathias Y. Anthony - set a brilliant record in the Cambridge School Certificate Examinations. The record stands unsurpassed to the present day. Dr. I. S. Ephson, Ph.D., Barrister-at-Law, in his Gallery of Gold Coast Celebrities, (1632-1958) referring to this great scholar of the School, has recorded of him at page 133 footnote as follows:\n\n\"In 1925, one, Mathias Anthony, an Ewe partly from Keta and partly from Lome, passed the Cambridge School Certificate examinations at Adisadel College (then St. Nicholas Grammar School) Cape Coast, offering Mathematics, English, French, German, Latin, Greek and other subjects. He thus gained exemption from Oxford and London University entrance requirements as well. His record, in a sense, has up till today not been beaten by any scholar either in Africa or elsewhere.\" This fine scholar who was the Head Prefect of the School in 1925, rose to become a distinguished physician in his life time. Earlier in 1923, G. G. Asafu-Adjaye, a student of the School had passed the Cambridge Senior School Certificate examination creditably, obtaining complete exemption from London Matriculation, the first student to score such a distinction in the country.\n\nExemptions\n\nAs evidence of good performances and satisfying certain requirements, successful candidates in the Cambridge Senior School Certificate Examinations usually gained complete exemptions from what were then known as `London Matriculation', `Cambridge Previous', and the `Oxford Responsions'. Formerly, it was only at Adisadel College that students could graduate with exemption from Oxford Responsions in addition to London Matriculation and Cambridge Previous. These privileges enabled candidates so qualified to be formally admitted as registered students of those Universities. This meant, in practice, that candidates so privileged were exempted from the preliminary examinations leading to the B.A. (or B.Sc.) degrees in the Universities of London, Cambridge or Oxford. Candidates could then proceed straight to read in their chosen fields of study for the next qualifying examinations (i.e. the Inter-B.A. or Inter B.Sc. as the case may be) either as external students (in the case of London University) or internal students at Oxford or Cambridge. At Oxford the first examination for the B.A. degree is referred to as \"Mods\" (short for moderations).\n\nUntil 1948, there was no university of any kind in the country, though Achimota College provided courses of studies leading up to the London University external examinations in the intermediate and final arts and science. Private students intent on pursuing university education in the country had to do so mostly through correspondence courses provided by tutorial institutions in Britain (e.g. Wosley Hall, University Correspondence College, Rapid Results College) for various degrees in the arts and sciences and for other professional and social studies. Alternatively, many of the students had to go overseas to further their studies. Some of the country's graduates in those days obtained their first degrees locally in this way.\n\nIndeed, Adisadel College set fine examples of diligent application to studies in this respect, for some of the old boys on the staff of the School, managed through self-help to win academic degrees for themselves, which reflected favourably on the School. In most cases, they initially read as external students of the University of London, before proceeding overseas for post-graduate studies.\n\nIt is on record that in 1926 an old boy of the School who was then a student of the University College, London - E. O. Asafu-Adjaye - won the coveted \"Profumo Prize\" for being the best scholar in Law at the University, following the results of the Final Bar (LLB) examinations that year. This splendid achievements, among several others, served to inspire other African scholars to embark on intensive studies in law and in medicine, and also to enter other fields of specialisation in various overseas universities. Many a Jason was thus induced to go overseas in search of, and bring home, the fabled \"Golden Fleece\".\n\nFollowing the attainment of independence, the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examinations gave way to the West African School Certificate Examinations and the General Certificate of Education, Ordinary and Advanced Levels (G.C.E. \"O\" and G.C.E. \"A\" levels) Examinations respectively. The West African School Certificates have also their equivalent in the G.C.E. `O' and `A' levels Certificates.\n\nThe West African School Certificates or the G.C.E. `O' level examinations are normally taken by Fifth Form students in the secondary schools. The G.C.E. `A' level is designed for Fifth Formers who have passed the `O' level examinations and have satisfied the basic requirements which entitled them to proceed to the Sixth Form Courses in preparation for the university. These courses, of two years duration, are run in a number of selected secondary schools, in the country, equipped with the necessary facilities for the purpose. Generally, three advanced level subjects are offered in the arts, mathematics and science departments. Passes in two or three such subjects constitute good performances, and qualify the successful candidates for entry to the university. The G.C.E `A' level certificate is more or less at par with the Cambridge Higher School Certificate, which formerly exempted a candidate from the London University Intermediate B. A. examinations.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nSuccesses\n\nThe School's record of successes in these examinations are, perhaps, too well-known to need mention here; but it suffices to cite one or two instances to give a fair assessment of the general performances of the School.\n\nIn 1968, for example, Adisadel presented 13 candidates from the Sixth Form Arts Department for the G.C.E. `A' level examination. All the candidates passed. Significantly, none of the candidates obtained one pass and none failed in any subject. Ten obtained three passes, and the remaining three obtained two passes. Besides, all the eight Students who took English passed, as did all the four candidates examined in French; the three candidates in Geography and all the eleven who took economics also passed.\n\nSimilarly, 10 candidates from the Mathematics Department presented for the G.C.E `A' level examination in Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Physics, were all successful. The passes were distributed as follows - one passed in two subjects, eight in all the three subjects and one in all the four subjects. The obvious significance of these results is that all the candidates passed well and more than satisfied the university entry requirements.\n\nIn the Science Department, of the 25 candidates who sat for the `A' level examination, twenty-three were successful - eight passed in three subjects, nine in two subjects and six in one subjects. In all, 17 of the 25 candidates passed well enough to satisfy the university entry requirements. The high level of performances in the examinations is reflected in the fact that eight distinctions were obtained in the various subjects, distributed in this way: one in History, one in Geography, one in Biology, two in Mathematics and three in Physics.\n\nIn the G.C.E. `O' level the results were no less outstanding. Although candidates have a choice of eight subjects at the most, a pass in one subject qualifies a candidate for a certificate. To obtain a good certificate however, a candidate must have at least four or more passes. Out of the 100 candidates presented by the School for that examination in 1968, 96 obtained certificates - seventy (70) passed in four or more subjects to qualify for good certificates. In all, 22 distinctions were secured in the various subjects.\n\nIn the West African School Certificate Examinations for 1962, no less than 40 per cent of the large number of candidates presented by the School obtained Grade One Certificates. In 1975. over 60 per cent of the Advanced Level candidates gained admission to the Universities. The break-down of the `A' level and `O' level examinations results are as follows: Eighty-two (82) out of the 84 candidates presented for the `A' Level passed. Of this number 49 obtained three passes; 23, two passes and 10, one pass. Five of the candidates did outstandingly well, each gaining `Excellent' and `Very Good' marks in their respective science subjects, that is, in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology as well as in geography and the general paper. In the `O' level examination, 94 per cent of the 133 candidates passed, 61 gained Grade One Certificates including nine (9) distinctions. In the 1978 examinations all the 141 candidates for the G.C.E. `O' level passed, six obtained distinctions and 40, Grade One certificates. In the G.C.E. `A' level, 57 out of the 63 candidates presented passed, 43 of them qualifying for entry into a university.\n\nThese results constitute creditable performances, a continuation of the unbroken chain of academic successes chalked up by the School over the years. There is no royal road to learning other than hard work. A former headmaster of the School has aptly summed up the spirit behind the School's examination successes in this witty way: \"five per cent inspiration and 95 per cent perspiration.\"\n\nAs a result of the excellent academic achievements of the School in the G.C.E. `A' level Examinations each year, an increasing number of students from Adisadel gain admission to our respective universities at Legon, Kumasi and Cape Coast, (including, of course, our Medical Schools) to pursue various courses of studies, among them medicine, and dentistry.\n\nScholarship Awards etc.\n\nIn respect of Scholarship awards for advanced studies overseas, fellowship and study tours, the School continues to secure a fair share. In 1968 for example, out of the 11 scholarships for university studies in the U.S.A. Adisadel College won five. The scholarships were offered to Ghana by the Universities Association of the U.S.A., and the selections were based strictly on merit or individual academic performance, followed by rigid interviews. In fact, an Adisadel boy topped the list in the scholarship competition organised for the purpose and there were seven Adisadel boys among the best 24 candidates. The winners had the opportunity of pursuing various courses of studies including Physics, Applied Mathematics and Pure Mathematics at such reputable universities in the U.S.A. as Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Connecticut.\n\nAdisadel College also won two of the five fellowships offered by the U.S. Government in that year. The fellowships were designed to offer an opportunity to Ghanaian teachers to teach in American public schools, so as to facilitate the exchange of ideas and ideals and also to enable the youth of America to gain some insight into aspects of Ghanaian life, tradition and culture. The two winners of the awards - P. M. Onumah and B. K. Mbroh - were Old Boys then on the staff of the School. The fine opportunity offered them to teach and make friends with a cross-section of the youth of America and acquaint themselves with the way of life in America enabled the recipients to project Ghana more effectively in the U.S.A. In this way, they helped to promote understanding and crystalised the bond of friendship and cordial relations between the two countries.\n\nIt is of interest also to record that when the competitive examinations for promotion to the grade of Executive Officer was introduced in the Civil Service, an Adisadel Old Boy - E. Hornsby-Odoi - topped the list of successful candidates in the initial examination. He afterwards won a government scholarship to Britain to pursue a degree course in Town Planning. At the end of the course, he also won the Silver Medal of the Town Planning Institute for producing the best Thesis in any recognised school in the Commonwealth. The scholar who rose to become Senior Lecturer in Town Planning at the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, is now Managing Director of the Tema Development Corporation.\n\nEarlier, when the Colonial Government instituted a training scheme for the Junior Civil Servants in the 1940's to prepare them for higher positions in the service, K. B. Ayensu, an Old Santaclausian, was one of the three candidates selected for university education in the United Kingdom. He went up to Hertford College, Oxford in 1943 and subsequently graduated B.A. in the Honour School of Jurispudence. \"K.B.\" held various posts of responsibility in the Civil Service and rose to become Clerk of the National Assembly. He ended his career in the Civil Service as Chief of State Protocol with the rank of an Ambassador. Kojo Ayensu is now Chairman of the Board Directors of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) and a member of the National Council for Higher Education.\n\nOf the second batch of three candidates who similarly benefited from overseas university education under the scheme, two were Old Boys of Adisadel - E. R. Hayford and S. E. Grant - both of whom read for the B.Sc. (Econ.) of the University of London.\n\nThese two beneficiaries had varied careers in the Civil Service. The former rose to the rank of Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Industries and the latter to that of Regional Chief Administrative Officer of the Eastern Region, a position equivalent to a Principal Secretary. The other Government scholars are: S. C. A. Chinery M.V., M.A., former Deputy Head of the Civil Service, J. M. Akita, M.A. (Cantab.) former Chief Archivist, now Senior Lecturer, Department of Library and Archival Studies, University of Ghana, Legon, B.C.L. Odei, B.Sc., (Econ,) who became Managing Director of the State Gold Mining Corporation and later of the Ghana Airways Corporation, S. E. Eshun, M.A., LLB., Barrister-at-Law, formerly of the Ministry of Justice. J. IC. Apakli, B.A., (Oxon.), (deceased) J. Aggrey-Mensah, B.Sc, (Eng. Hons.), Chief Engineer. Post and Telecommunications Corporation, among others.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nNotable Achievements\n\nThe Sekyi brothers deserve mention here for their individual academic brilliance. Kweku Sekyi, B.A., LLB., Barrister-at-Law scored a `First' in Philosophy at Cork, Ireland and a 'Double First' in his bar examinations as a member of the King's Inns, while Henry Van Hein Sekyi also took a First Class B.A., (Hons.), degree in Classics at Legon (then in special relationship with London University) and then followed up at Cambridge where he also tool-, First Class Honours Classical Tripos Part I. In the Part II however, he just missed his usual `First.' Van Hein Sekyi is probably the first student at Legon to win a First in Classics at the erstwhile University College of the Gold Coast now the University of Ghana. K. A. Sekyi, LL.B., the youngest (popularly called \"Chief\") also excelled himself in law as did his elder brother before him. It is remarkable that Kofi Amenyi Sekyi (the eldest) and Kweku Anu Sekyi (the elder) were brilliant scholars in Mathematics both won the Fisher's Mathematics Prizes for 1939 and 1940 respectively. Besides, Van-Hein Sekyi is a talented musician and has the singular honour of delivering the Silver Jubilee Lectures of the University of Ghana, organised under the auspices of the University Alumni Association in 1974. Van Hein Sekyi is now Ghana Permanent Representative to the United National and currently Vice-President of the UN Economic and Social Council and was the former Ghana High Commissioner to Britain. K.A. Sekyi is also at present the Chief State Attorney of the Attorney General's Department of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThese brilliant scholars are no other than the sons of the late redoubtable W. E. G. Sekyi, M.A. (London), Barrister-at-Law one of the 'Faithful Eight' of Mfanstipim School, who was popularly known as Kobina Sekyi of the erstwhile Gold Coast Aborigines Rights Protection Society's fame and who apart from being an eminent barrister in his day, was also a brilliant scholar, statesman and patriot. The Sekyis are, naturally, as valiant as they are erudite and scholarly.\n\nLieutenant-General Okatakyie Akwasi Amankwa Afrifa, C.V., D.S.O., Hon. LL.D., was a brilliant all-round scholar at Adisadel, and later, while studying as an officer cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, he showed up well, and his performances at the course, brought great honour to the School, the Ghana Army and the country generally when he took an enviable position in the final examinations. He was listed among the best three of those cadets (drawn from various parts of the Commonwealth and other countries) who graduated and passed out as Second-Lieutenant after the course.\n\nAkwasi Afrifa, when then a Major ill the Ghana Army, played a key and decisive role, in the 1965 Coup d'etat that marked a turning point in the history of Ghana He rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General and Chairman of the three-man Presidential Commission during the regime of the National Liberation Council (NLC) which prepared the country for a return to civilian rule in 1969.\n\nIn recognition of his valour, the Asanteman Council in 1970, bestowed on him the title of Okatakyie i.e. \"The Gallant One\", a special title of honour in Akan Society bestowed on a leader (warrior) who exhibits exceptional courage or performs daring acts of bravery in battle to save his people from the iron heels of tyranny or from annihilation by the enemy. The University of Ghana for its part, conferred on him the honorary doctorate degree of LLD.\n\nGeneral Afrifa, the author of \"The Ghana Coup 1966,\" was keenly interested in the concept Of Rural Development and was tireless in his efforts to give practical meaning to his innovative idea. On his retirement from active public service, he settled down to farming in his estate at Okatakyiekrom originated by him as a model farmstead where he engaged himself in the rearing of sheep and cultivation of food crops particularly maize on a large scale, a clear demonstration of 'Self- Reliance.' Of course, many other Old Boys of Adisadel College have emerged as \"the first or with the first\" to chalk up distinction in the academic and other fields. The following may be mentioned in support of this observation.\n\nAlbert Hammond was the first external student in Ghana to obtain the London University B.A. (Hons.) degree in Classics entirely by private study; so was Dr. C. A. Ackah, who took the M.A. degree and later the Ph.D., in Sociology and Moral Philosophy respectively. At Oxford, Prof. William E. Abraham, who became Pro-Vice Chancellor, University of Ghana, obtained the M.A., B. Phil. degrees of that ancient University. He had the distinction of being the first full-blooded African to be admitted a Fellow of All Souls College Oxford and thus achieve a great name as a scholar for both his country and his Alma Mater. Prof. Abraham who is now at Stanford University California, U.S.A. is an active member of the Institute of Greek Philosophy and Science Council for Philosophical Studies, an influential Philosophical set-up in the U:S.A. Among his numerous works is \"The Mind of Africa\" published in 1962. Mr. Justice Enoch Edusei also earned the B.C.L., another coveted postgraduate degree at Oxford. He had previously graduated LLB. (Hons.) at the University of Leeds England in 1955 winning the coveted Hughes Law Prize in the attempt.\n\nAnother achievement at Oxford worthy of mention is that of Kwa O. Hagan who, at an advanced age, had the distinction of being admitted (without a previous degree) under special `Dispensation' to proceed on a research study, under the auspices of the Faculty of Social Studies, and succeeded in obtaining the coveted post-graduate degree of Bachelor of Letters - B. Litt. (Oxon.). Dr. Charles Van Dyck also achieved no mean feat at Oxford where he took the B. Litt. and D. Phil. degrees and in addition won the Oxford Blue, a most coveted sports accolate at that famous university.\n\nAt Cambridge, Prof. J. A. K. Quartey, F.R.I.C., a Fellow of Churchill College, took the M.A., and Ph.D., in Natural Science, specialising in Organic Chemistry and is the first African ever to be elected a Fellow at Cambridge. He is a Chemistry Professor at the University of Ghana, Legon.\n\nThen, there is Prof. Ebenezer Laing the noted botanist and genetician, now the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Ghana, who took the Ph. D. at Cambridge after graduating B.Sc., Special (London). Mention must here also be made of the Prof. J. S. Pobee, of the Department of the Study of Religion, University of Ghana, who took his B.A. and M.Litt., at Cambridge, having earlier graduated B.D., (Lond.).\n\nAnother Santaclausian who must not escape notice is Prof. E. N. W., Oppong who took the M.R.C.V.S. at Cambridge in addition to B.V.S.C. & AH., Ph. D (Dub.), DTVM (Edinburgh) Prof. Oppong specialises in Animal Science and is currently Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Legon.\n\nThat the \"Adisadel Spirit\" can, to speak literally, `propel' Santaclausians to \"do exploits\" to the extent of seeking adventure elsewhere, breaking new grounds and achieving successes even in unusual places is now an established fact. Thus, in the late 1940Â’s, an Old Santaclausian, Eric G. K. Adjorlolo M.Sc., B.F.A., one of the fine 1941 class of scholars at Adisadel, in his arduous quest for higher education in the U.S.A., braved all odds and eventually emerged not only as the first African to obtain the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at the Columbia University School of Painting and Sculpture but also the first graduate from Ghana to do advanced courses in Jounalism at that famous American University.\n\nThis attempt earned him as well as the M.Sc., in Journalism and Mass-Communication - a rarely beaten track in those days! One - time Deputy Director-General of Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, Eric is currently the O.A.U. Permanent Representative to Equatorial Guinea, resident in Malabo.\n\nAt this juncture, tribute must be paid to the memory of two other outstanding Santaclausian scholars who have sad to say passed away.\n\nOne was the late Dr. A. A. Y. Kyerematen, the inspirer, founder, and first director of the National Cultural Centre described as \"the bastion and shrine of Ghana's cultural heritage\" and the Zoo at Kumasi. This was a great national project to which he devoted all his talents and energy, after his return from Oxford. Dr. Kyerematen was much encouraged in this great endeavour by the late Asantehene, Otumfuo Sir Agyeman Prempeh II, K.B.E.\n\nAmong Dr. Kyerematen's numerous works, his colourful book - PANOPLY OF GHANA - is almost a complete encyclopedia of Ghanaian culture with particular reference to the traditional regalia of the various chiefs of Ghana, the symbols of chieftaincy around which the culture of the country is largely woven.\n\nDr. Kyerematen was at one time Town Clerk of the Kumasi City Council subsequently becoming Commissioner for Local Government and later Chairman of the Council of the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi. His life was characterised by selflessness, simplicity and devotion to national duty.\n\nThe other was Prof. A. M. L. Taylor, M.A., D. Phil,. (Oxon) F.R.A.S who made his name as an outstanding mathematics lecturer at the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nOld Boys In Other Specialised Fields\n\nIt is significant that since the emphasis was shifted from Classics to Science at Adisadel barely two decades ago, the School has made impressive strides in the field of science. Students of the School usually develop a flair for the study of the various branches of science, thanks to facilities available at the School. A tradition in science studies has thus been established in the School in just the same way as was the case in the study of the Classics in the past. Several Old Boys of Adisadel are specialists holding not only various high professional qualifications, particularly in the medical and engineering science, but also occupy responsible positions in various fields. For instance, in the field of Water Resources, Adisadel has C. K. Annan B.Sc. (Eng.). D.I.C., F.I.C.E., M.I.W.E:, F.Gh.I.E., formerly Managing Director of Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) who master-mined the gigantic Water and Sewerage Disposal Scheme for the Accra/Tema metropolitan area, the first phase of which he saw through successfully before his retirement. E. Adjei-Kufuor, B.Sc., (Civil) M.I.C.E., M.I.P.H.E. M.I.H.E. A.M.I.Mn.E. M.Gh.I.E., an experienced civil engineer heads the Water Project Division of GWSC now engaged in various water project in the country.\n\nIn the electrical engineering field, Adisadel also has E. Q. Hayfron-Acquah, B.Sc., (Eng.) C. Eng., F.Gh.I.E., M.I.E.E., formerly Chief Electrical Engineer of the Electricity Department (the last of the tribe) and the first Managing Director of the Electricity Corporation of Ghana now Resident Director, West Africa and Managing Director of Kabel Medals (Ghana) Limited, Tema, K. A. Duker B.Sc. (Eng.) M.I.E.E., F.Gh.I.E., Managing Director of Electricity Corporation of Ghana and A. O. El Alawa, B.Sc., (Eng) F.Gh.I.E., former Accra City Engineer now head of the newly created Central Technical Directorate of the Ministry of Local Government, not to mention W. E. Coleman, G.M., M.B.E., B.Sc., (Eng.) D.E., F.Gh.I.E., F.I.E.E., first Ghanaian Director-General of Broadcasting who is now Telecommunications Specialist for Africa, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia among several others. Post and Telecommunications Engineering is another field in which Old Boys of Adisadel are holding their own. Peter Bawuah B.Sc.., (Eng.) M.E.I.C., etc. is Director of Engineering in charge of Internal Telecommunications Service (ITS) at the Post Telecommunications Corporation and his deputy, J. E. Sampson-Davis, B.Sc., (Eng.) M.Gh.I.E., is in charge of System Planning. J. Aggrey-Mensah, B.Sc., Hons. (Eng.), M.Gh.I.E., Chief Engineer has made a name of himself as the inventor of a highly sensitive Underground Telephone Cable Theft Detection System now installed at the Tema Post Office.\n\nThe Volta River Authority (VRA) is responsible for the Operations of the gigantic Volta River Hydro-Electric Power Dam and related project, seems also to have become the \"magnetic field\" for Old Santaclausians with specialised skills. Apart from Mr. Justice Enoch Edusei, L.L.B. (Leeds) B.C.L. (Oxon.) Justice of Appeal, who is Chairman of the Authority, Dr. L. K. A. Derban, M.B., Ch. B., D. P. H., D. I. H., D.T.M. & H., is Chief Medical Officer; L. Casely-Hayford, B.Sc. (Eng), F.Ch.I.E., Deputy Chief Executive (Engineering) E. Nanka-Bruce, B.Sc. (Eng.) M.Gh.I.E.. Director of Power Operations: F.V.L. Laryea, Director of Personnel, C.A. Nelson, Town Planning Manager and Joe Daniels, Senior Accounts Officer, among others.\n\nThen, in the sphere of Road Transport, Nana Fredua Mensah G.M., F.C.I.T., N.G.I.M. is Managing Director of the Omnibus Services Authority responsible for the country's internal and international bus services. M. K. Aifah, M.C.I.T., General Manager of State Transport Corporation, and his Chief Engineer, C. W. Tachie-Menson A.M.I.M.I., Traffic Manager, E. K. Anyim and Personnel Manager, Isaac D. Dickson A.C.C.A., all stand in a class by themselves in this field. L. Bakers-Woode sees to the transport service of the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board.\n\nThere are also many graduate and professionally qualified pharmacists who are Old Santaclausians serving in key positions. Prominent among them are: Martin S. Donkor, Ph.C., M.P.S., M.I. Pharm. M., M. Inst. Pkg. (UK) Pharmaceutical/Production Director, J. L. Morrison Sons and Jones (Ghana) Limited, J. Pearce-Biney, B. Pharm. (Glas.) Ph.C., M.P.S., M.I. Pharm. M., Pharmacy Merchandise Comptroller and T. O. Hutton-Mills, Ph.C., M.P.S., M.I. Pharm. M., Pharmacy Sales Manager, both of Kingsway Stores Division of U.A.C. (Ghana) Limited, T. E. C. Sagoe, Ph.C., M.P.S., M.I. Pharm. M., former Chief Pharmacist and M.A. Akiwumi, MPS etc. Supervising Pharmacist both of the Ministry of Health. Interestingly, Pearce-Biney, is the Director-Secretary of the Institute of Pharmacy Management International (Ghana Branch) and Ghana's representative on the Council of West African Pharmaceutical Federation. He served on the Ghana delegation to the 31st World Health Organsnisation (WHO) Assembly held at Geneva, Switzerland in May 1978. The Assembly deliberated on the issues of Drugs, among other things.\n\nTom Sagoe, now Managing Director of Netherlands African Manufacturing Company Limited (NAMCO) also served as Ghana's representative on the Narcotics Commission of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. He is currently a member of the Narcotics Enforcement Officers Association of the United States of America.\n\nChartered Accountancy and Auditing are yet other fields in which several Old Santaclausians have established themselves. For example, K. E. Woode, F.C.C.A., C.A., A.T.I.L, is Director of K. E. Woode and Company a local firm of Chartered Accountants and Auditors, so is S. K. B. Taylor, A.C.C.A,. F.C.A., C.A. Director of Kobina Taylor and Company. A. A. Adjei, A.C.C.A., Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax sees to the country's income tax operations while J.B.H. Coleman, C. J. Otoo and William Brown, as Directors of Audit in the Auditor-General's Department keep sharp eyes on the nation's accounts and ensure that public funds are - properly accounted for at all times. J. S. Haizel, A.C.C.A. of Deloitte and Company, Chartered Accountants, among others, similarly deals with the accounts of various private companies and corporations in the country.\n\nThen coming to the field of sports and physical culture, prominent sports personalities, past and present who are Old Santaclausians can be mentioned: In the 1960's when Ghana was on the ascendency as the \"Soccer Champions of Africa\", Nana Fredua Mensah was Chairman of the Ghana Football Association and one-time Executive Member of the African Football Confederation (AFC). Mr. Justice I. R. Aboagye has now stepped into his shoes as Chairman of tile Ghana Football Association (GFA) which has the task of developing soccer at various levels in the country in particular, building up the national team, the Black Stars, effectively for all international encounters. The present Executive-Chairman of the Sports Council of Ghana and General Secretary of the National Olympic Committee (NOC), R. T. Orleans-Pobee is a qualified Physical Education Specialist (Jordan Hill, Glasgow) so is the director of Physical Education and Culture at the Ministry of Education and Culture, S. A. Nelson, who was a plucky athlete and head prefect of the School in 1949. Sam Nelson has, for several years, been the Chairman of the Ghana Amateur Athletics Association (GAAA) and H. O. Nyarko., the- National Athletics Coach.\n\nS. L. Ackah-Yensu, yet another colourful sports personality, is well known for his interesting commentaries on soccer in T.V. Sports Programmes. He was formerly Secretary of the Ghana Football Association and Team Manager of the Black Stars, the national soccer team. Ackah-Yensu who is Chief Manager (Administration) of the State Insurance Corporation is the Safohene of Inkum a quarter, of Cape Coast. (Traditionally, `Safohene' is captain of the local militia, of which there are seven at Cape Coast).\n\nWillie Kwarteng, the Editor of \"Weekly Spectator\", carried the reputation of a champion in the 1950Â’s and set records in the 880 yards race in the inter-schools and colleges sports meetings. He also took part in international athletic competitions and was among the Ghana Sports Contingents to the Commonwealth Games held at Vancouver, Canada, in 1954. He won the Victores Laudorum in 1956.\n\nDr. Charles Van-Dyck won the enviable accolate \"Oxford Blue\" at Oxford University being probably the first African ever to win such a distinction in sports at that ancient British University, Incidentally Dr. Van-Dyck; was the head prefect of Adisadel in 1951 and besides he reigned as the Victores Laudorum from 1949 to 1951.\n\nApart from Orleans-Pobee who was a notable athlete of the School to become a athletics coach and later Headmaster of his Alma Mater (1963-1974) the others were active athletes, head prefects and/or winners of the Victores Laudorum the symbol of fine sporting tradition at Adisadel.\n\nOther Old Santaclausians are active as well in the music and entertainment fields. Frank K. Otchere is well known in the Popular Saturday Morning Radio Programme \"Uncle Frank Show\" which won for him a UNESCO CITATION in 1976 for his \"services to the youth\".\n\nDaniel K. Amponsah, popularly known to traditional music lovers as KOO NIMO is an exponent of traditional music based on Akan folklore. He is the leader of the Kumasi Adadam Agofomma traditional music group, whose records and T.V, appearances are hailed by all classes of people in the country. A technologist by profession, Amponsah works in the Department of Bio-Chemistry at the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi.\n\nAdisadel Scholars dyed in the Primus Vel Cum Primis tradition, will not be complete without Captain J. H. Tachie-Menson, F.C.I.T., M.I.N., who is not only the first Ghanaian to obtain a Master Mariner's Certificate but also the first African to command a merchant vessel on the high seas. The bearded maritime captain is a talented musician and composer and is now the Managing Director of the Black Star Line, Ghana's national shipping company. Another Old Santaclausian, Captain Powis Spencer, an experienced international aviator, pilots the new Ghana Airways DC-9 twin-jet airliner on the West African routes.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nAdisadel's Contribution To National Development\n\nAlmost four score years is a relatively short time in the life of an institution but a long one, indeed, a life time in human existence. During those years, however, the School has not only made itself felt but actually contributed its share to the development and progress of the nation in diverse ways.\n\nOver the years, the School has turned out into the world a steady stream of keen, capable young men, filled with enthusiasm and dedicated to the service of the country - men who have contributed and continue to contribute their quota to the enrichment of the life of the nation, in practically all fields of human endeavour, as eminent judges, lawyers, doctors, engineers, chiefs, administrators, civil servants, educationists, economists, agriculturists, company directors, bankers, soldiers, publishers, journalists and writers etc.\n\nThe School has produced as well leaders of thought and action. Not a few of the Old Boys have played vital roles in the affairs of the country and helped to shape its destiny. In the earlier movements for constitutional reforms, there are records of Old Santaclausians who, were influential. Dr. J. W. de Graft Johnson, Chas Sagoe, J. C. Fry and C. F. Hayfron-Benjamin, for instance, were among the compatriots of their day who were in the thick of the fight for constitutional reform for the country. Dr. de Graft-Johnson and Hayfron-Benjamin both seasoned barristers intelligently and effectively employed the medium of the press that is, the might of the pen, to the advantage of the country.\n\nAt certain stages in the constitutional history of the country, in the 1940's and 1950's new breed of active leaders of thought and action dominated the political scene. They were among the influential members of the Legislative Council, the country's law-making body. These included such notable figures as the late Nana Amanfi III, C.B.E., Omanhene of Asebu; Nana Sir Tsibu Darku X Kt.. O.B.E. Omanhene of Assin Attandaso, Nene Azzu Mate-Kole O.B.E., Konor of Manya Krobo. Odumase, Dr. I. B. Asafu-Adjaye, and the late Sir Edward O. Asafu-Adjaye, Kt.all Old Santaclausians. Sir Tsibu and Dr. Asafu-.Adjaye were also then members of the Governor's Executive Council. Their incisive but well-reasoned arguments enriched the debates of the Council and influenced the policy and direction of affairs. This helped to accelerate the pace of constitutional reform in the country.\n\nAt the height of the struggle for `Self-Government Now' spearheaded by the Convention People's Party (C.P.P.) led by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, of blessed memory a core of redoubtable Old Boys of Adisadel emerged among the stalwarts who dared, undeterred by imprisonment and other threats and harassments, to secure independence for the country, and thereafter went on to launch out Ghana on her course as a free, independent and sovereign Republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. Popular leaders in the government of the First Republic whose names were household words at that time included K. A. Gbedema, the able Minister of Finance and Kojo Botsio, the Minister of Agriculture, the late Sir-Edward O. Asafu-Adjaye, Minister of Local Government, K. O. Thompson, Minister of Mines and Natural Resources and J. E. Hagan, the Regional Commissioner for the Central Region who are all Old Boys.\n\nWhen the National Liberation Council (NLC) came to power, Old Santaclausians were not without their places too in the new order. Lt.-Gen A. A. Afrifa was Chairman of the 3-man Presidential Commission that took the country back to civilian rule in 1969. Matthew Poku, (now Otumfuo Nana Opoku Ware II, Asantehene and President of the National House of Chiefs) and David Andoh, Chairman of U.A.C. (Ghana) Limited, both barristers by profession, served as Commissioner for Transport and Communications and Commissioner for Lands and Mineral Resources respectively. The late Dr. A. A. Y. Kyerematen served as Commissioner for Local Government.\n\nThe government of the Second Republic (1969 - 1972) headed by the late Dr. K. A. Busia, also brought on the scene, Old Santaclausians. These included Dr. T. A. Aboagye, LLM, (Lond.) Ph.D., (Cantab.) who served as Ministerial Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, and S. K. C. Osei-Baidoo, Ministerial Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development. Casely Osei-Baidoo studied Trade Unionism at Ruskin College, Oxford and was at one time, Trade Union organiser at the erstwhile University College of Gold Coast, B. J. da Rocha LL.B., the first Ghanaian to enroll in the Supreme Court, following the attainment of independence, was the General Secretary of the Progress Party, the party of the government then in power.\n\nIn the Supreme Military Council regime, Dr. R. K. A. Gardiner served as Commissioner for Economic Planning, Major Kwame Asante, Commissioner for Transport and Communications and Major Michael Ofori-Akuamoah, Regional Commissioner for Upper Region.\n\nCol. F. G. Bernasko, who also served as Regional Commissioner for the Central Region later moved up as Commissioner for Agriculture, becoming the first Commissioner for Cocoa Affairs before retiring finally to devote himself to his chosen career as a legal practitioner.\n\nE. N. Moore a barrister and advocate of wide experience and practice (who is traditionally, the Oman-Supi of Eberarm in the Ekumfi traditional area) served as Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General during the first three years of the Council's rule. S. H. Annancy, Barrister-at-Law, took up the baton as Regional Commissioner for the Eastern Region, on the last lap of the race to constitutional rule in July 1979.\n\nK. Gyeke-Dako, during his tenure of office as Director of Public Prosecutions successfully led formidable legal brains in the conduct of several cases for the State at the Tribunals and the High Court. Gyeke-Dako is now Legal Adviser to the Ghana Police Force.\n\nThe above are some of the ways in which Old Santaclausians have served and continue to serve not only to run the affairs of state in the corridors of power but also to maintain the rule of law to ensure peace and security of the state.\n\nIn the exciting process of developing the country and of projecting the image of Ghana abroad since the attainment of independence, a number of Old Boys have played and continue to play important and vital roles as diplomats - High Commissioners and Ambassadors - the country's accredited representatives in other lands (see list of Old Boys who have served Ghana as diplomats later in this book) and as international civil servants some are serving in the United Nations and its specialised agencies not only helping to maintain peace and security in the world at large but also to promote harmony and the well-being of humanity.\n\nBusiness and Industry\n\nThe success stories of Old Santaclausians are however not confined exclusively to the political and academic spheres. They extend to the business and industrial fields as well. In the industrial sphere, W. C. Tandoh has established himself as an industrialist-cum-agriculturalist with a lot of guts and business acumen. With the country's economic development and prosperity at heart, Willie Tandoh has set up a wholly Ghanaian owned, financed and managed companies of a complex nature at Tema.\n\nThe industrial complex of which he is the Executive Chairman - The West Coast Group of Companies - incorporates a Spinning, Dyeing and Solid Construction Companies with extensive Cotton Farms constituting a regular source of raw materials not only for the Spinning Factory itself but also other textile factories and 'Kente' weaving industries in the country. A pilot livestock project is also in progress.\n\nThis incorporated group of companies is a splendid example of Self-Reliance which forms the basis of the country's economic and agricultural policies and gives, as well, a practical interpretation of the \"Operation Feed Yourself and Your Industries\" Programmes. The scope and importance of this great enterprise to the economy of Ghana is reflected in the fact that in September 1975, the West Coast Group of Companies was formally commissioned by General I. K. Acheampong (as he then was) the former Head of State and Chairman of the Supreme Military Council at a colourful ceremony in the presence of distinguished guests from all walks of life. Willie Tandoh is certainly playing a pivotal rule in the economic life of the country and deserves the support and co-operation of all fellow Old Santaclausians. His singular efforts reflect creditably on the Adisadel Spirit of Self Help and should inspire and motivate other Old Santaclausians to dare and accomplish similar ventures for the development and progress of the country.\n\nThe School with the support of the Old Boys extends to Willie Tandoh and the Management of West Coast Group of Companies of which he is the Executive-Chairman sincere gratitude and thanks for the splendid - gift of 5,000.00 cedis (five thousand cedis) for the equipment of the School's Science Laboratory, in addition to undertaking to sponsor the setting up of a Trade School, to serve as a Vocational/Technical Department of Adisadel College. Santaclausians are in duty bound to help, in every way possible, to realise this needful project for the School.\n\nI. B. Phillips, another enterprising Old Boy has been tireless in his efforts towards promoting the economic development of the country. As an astute industrialist and companies' director, Isaac Phillips has had wide and varied business experiences and interests. His ventures have included transport and bulk haulage services, estate agency, metal works, imports and exports and laundry. The Wiseway Cleaners Limited, a subsidiary of Development Consortium of which he is the Executive Director, serves as industrial launderers and provides efficient laundry services to educational institutions including the University of Ghana, and various other bodies. `Buck' as he is popularly called, is largely a self-made man. And like Willie Tandoh, his altruism and public-spritedness are praise worthy. J. W. Quashie, also an Old Santaclausian, is managing the City Laundries Limited, a dry cleaning company operating in Accra. He was formerly Deputy-Director, Post and Telegraphs Department. Other Old Santaclausians to reckon with in the local business field include Cyprian Nkansah and E.K. Osei, both general contractors. David Andoh is Chairman of the giant Anglo-Ghanaian firm, U.A.C. (Ghana) Limited.\n\nThe Learned Professions\n\nAdisadel is fairly well represented in the learned professions. In terms of popularity and sheer numbers, there appears to be a predominance of Old Santaclausians in the legal profession to the extent of literally \"swamping\" the Ghana Bench and Bar. In the Judicial Service itself, for instance, Adisadel is represented on the Bench by no less than three Justices of Appeal and about four High Court Judges, besides a number of Circuit Court Judges and top-grade State Attorneys, at the Attorney Generals Department headed by a Director of Public Prosecutions who is himself an Old Santaclausian.\n\nIt is remarkable that Adisadel has produced some of the legal luminaries of the country. Among the earlier generation of barristers and advocates were Dr. J. W. de Graft Johnson, M.A., D.C.L., Koi O. Larbi, M.A., B.C.L., one-time Judge of the Supreme Court, C. F. Hayfron-Benjamin, B.A., LL.B., and Sir Edward O. Asafu-Adjaye, B.A., LL.B., the first Ashanti barrister who had also the distinction of being the first African ever to win the coveted \"Profumo Prize\" for being the best scholar in law in the Final Bar examinations of the University of London in 1926, an achievement that did Ghana then the Gold Coast proud.\n\nSir Edward, one of the few elder statesmen in his time, served creditably in various spheres of our national life. He was one-time Minister of Local Government, later becoming Ghana High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland and received the Knighthood for distinguished service to the Commonwealth.\n\nNotable among the present generation of barristers is K. Gyeke-Dako, B.A., LL.B., Dip. International Law. Gyeke-Dako studied law at Southampton London and Cambridge Universities and held several fellowships including the Dag Hammerskjoeld Memorial International Law Fellowship, the United Nations Fellowship in International Law and the British Institute of International and Comparative Law Fellowship. He is the author of, among others, \"Economic Sanctions under the United Nations\" which deals with economic sanctions as an instrument for enforcing obedience to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Incidentally, Gyeke-Dako is known in traditional life as Nana Dako Ampem I, Kyidomhene of Adukrom, Akwapim.\n\nThe medical profession is another field in which the number of Old Santaclausians is increasing. In the Teaching Hospitals and especially in the country's medical schools, the Old Boys are a force to reckon with. At the University of Ghana Medical School at Korle Bu, Prof. B. Y. A. Andoh, B.Sc. (Wilberf.) M. A., (Harvard) M.D., DR. rer. nat. (Heidel) a medical scientist, specialises in Bio-Chemistry working special relation to Medicine and Metabolism and is currently working on the isolation and therapeutic uses of drugs prepared from plants from Ghanaian forests. Prof. J. O. M. Pobee, M.B., B.S., M.R.C.P. specialises in Cardiology, Dr. K. O. Bentsi-Enchill, M.D., F.R.C.S., D.O., in Opthalmology and Dr. A. R. Sarbah-Yalley, B.Sc., M.B., Ch.B., M.R.C.O.G., in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dr. L. K. A. Derban, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H., D.I.H., D.T. M. and H., formerly of the Ghana Medical School now Chief Medical Officer, Volta River Authority also specialises in Occupational Health Therapeutics, among several others.\n\nThe teaching profession usually an old beaten track has opened up new vistas of opportunity for fruitful careers for those who have intellectual turn of mind. The scholars are now breaking new grounds as Principals and Headmasters of Training. Colleges and Secondary Schools and as lecturers and professors at the universities. And as in the other spheres, Adisadel has produced an impressive number of university teachers in various disciplines. At Legon, the professors at present are: Dr. Ebenezer Laing. B.Sc., Ph.D., (Botany); Dr. J. A. K. Quartey, M.A., Ph.D., FRIC. (Chemistry); Dr. E. N. W. Oppong, M.R.V.C.S., B.V.S.C. and A.H., Ph.D., D.T.V.M. (Animal Science); Dr. G. S. Asante, B.S.A., Ph.D., (Bio-Chemistry); .J. E. Wiredu, B.A., B.Phil., (Philosophy); J. S. Pobee, B.D., B.A., M.Litt., (Religious Studies); Prof. W. E. Abraham, M.A., B.Phil., (Philosophy) former Vice-Chancellor (now in the United States of America).\n\nThe Senior Lecturers include: Dr. G. K. Osei, B.Sc., M.Phil., (Mathematics); Dr. P. G. Lamptey, M.Sc., Ph.D., (Crop Science); Dr. P. K. Twumasi, M.Sc., Ph.D., (Sociology), Dr. G. Adeleye, M.A., Ph.D., (Classics); Dr. K. A. Sampson, M.A., Ph.D., (Modern Languages); Dr. D. B. Ampratwum, M.Sc., Ph.D., (Agricultural Engineering) M. A. Kissi, M.A., (Philosophy); J. M. Akita, M.A., (Archival Studies). At the University of Cape Coast, Dr. R. A. Ampomah, M.Sc., Ph.D., specialises in Mathematics, C. E. Ameyaw-Akumfi, M.Sc., in Zoology, and K. Osafo-Gyirnah, M.A., in Economics. At the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, there are also Old Boys who are lecturers of similar ranks in various fields.\n\nE. A. K. Edzii, B.A. is Registrar of the University of Ghana, Legon; G. M. Pitcher. F.L.A., is Chief Librarian and Head of the Library Service of the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi.\n\nIt is gratifying that one of the old scholars of the School, E. F. Laing (now deceased) a former General Manager of the Anglican Educational Unit, founded the Holy Trinity Cathedral Secondary School, a co-educational day secondary school in Accra to meet the educational need of the Church, and was its first headmaster (1970-75). The school is at present located at the Bishopscourt under the shadow of the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity.\n\nAnother new education institution of the Church, a co-educational, Secondary/Commercial/Vocational School at Cape Coast, the Academy of Christ The King, was founded by His Lordship the Bishop of Accra, the Rt. Revd. I. S. M. LeMaire, GM., D.D., himself an Old Boy. The school has also an Old Boy as its first Principal in the person of the Revd. Fr. Robert G. A. Okine, B.Min., M.A., Ed.S.\n\nA number of Old Boys who have retired from the public civil services but are still virile and mentally active continue to Drake their service available to the nation in various fields. Those who are keen on judicial work and in the dispensation of justice are serving as non-professional Magistrates in the Grade II Courts. This class of judicial officers have included H. A. H. S. Grant, J. M. Awotwi, H. L. Aseidu-Akrofi, K. E. Essah, G. J. Tekyi-Mensah, N. S. Thompson, J. B. K. Anane, among others.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nInternational Service\n\nOld Boys of Adisadel can also be found serving in various international organisations. Apart from the Universities and other institutions of higher education abroad in which several scholars of Adisadel work shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts as professors, deans and heads of departments and faculties, there are many others serving in the various specialised agencies of the United Nations Organisation notably in the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nA few of the Old Boys may be mentioned. H. V. H. Sekyi is Ghana Permanent Representative at the United Nations and currently Vice-President of the UN Economic and Social Council. W.F. Coleman is currently Telecommunications Specialist for Africa at the E.C.A. based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Eric G. K. Adjorlolo is the Permanent Representative of the O.A.U to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea resident in Malabo, Dr. L. K. A. Derban, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H., D.I.H., D.T.M., and H. Chief Medical officer Volta River Authority one of the few Ghanaian Occupational Health Specialists in the country serves on the Expert Advisory Panel of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. N.

S., formerly of the Education Department and later Department of Social Welfare and Community Development is Associate Director of the American Peace Corps Volunteers in Ghana and is the first African to hold such a position in an American establishment in Africa.\n\nDr. R. K. A. Gardiner, M.A., (Cantab.), B.Sc., Econ. (Lond.), has achieved eminence as an international civil servant and an economist of repute. He is best known for his work as Executive-Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) a position which he held for over 12 years. Dr. Gardiner served during the forties as Area Specialist at the Trusteeship Division of the United Nations Secretariat in New York and during the Congo crisis of 1962, he was appointed Personal Representative of Dag Hammerskjoeld the then UN Secretary-General. In that capacity apart from supervising the UN Operations there, he managed to effect reconciliation among the feuding factions. He also did much to build up the tottering civil administration. following the withdrawal of the Belgians then the administering power from that territory. Dr. Gardiner was at one time Director of Extra-Mural Studies at the erstwhile University College of Ibadan, Nigeria and was David Livingstone Visiting Professor of Economics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Scotland (1970-75).

Danquah Memorial Lectures (1970) and the Aggrey-Fraser-Guggisberg Memorial lectures (1972).\n\nAt home, Dr. Gardiner held several responsible positions including Director of Social Welfare and Community Development, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Housing, Establishment Secretary and head of the Civil Service.\n\nBefore his appointment as Commissioner for Economic Planning, Dr. Gardiner was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Post and Telecommunications Corporation and was named Visiting Professor of Economics and Senior Consultant to the Centre for Development Studies, University of Cape Coast. He is a Fellow of Selwyn College Cambridge, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Science, and the Ghana Institute of Management. Just before retiring from active public service, he was awarded the insignia of Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of the Volta (CV) for distinguished services as Commissioner for Economic Planning.\n\nDr. Gardiner is the recipient of many honorary doctorate degrees conferred on him by various recognised Universities including the University of Science and Technology Kumasi for his scholarship and outstanding services to Africa and the International community. It has been said of him that at one time, he \"just missed\" becoming the Secretary General of the United Nations. Dr. Gardiner is one of the few distinguished Africans whom Ghana in particular and Africa in general, can well feel proud and grateful for.\n\nSacred Ministry\n\nOf the objectives that prompted the founding of the School, perhaps none was decisive and crucial to the Church more than that of producing priests for the \"propagation of the Gospel\". Although the rate of production has not been as rapid as should be expected over the years, nevertheless appreciable progress has been made. The future prospects look brighter now that better facilities for training are available locally i.e. Trinity College, Legon.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of the first Old Boy to become a clerk in Holy Orders - the Venerable C. H. Elliott, who providentally is the only survivor of the 29 foundation scholars - many other boys have dedicated their lives to the services of the Church, cheerfully labouring in the Master's Vineyard. In fact, they are finding fulfillment in the work of winning more souls for Christ, and ministering to the spiritual needs of their fellow men. This means, in practice, that one of the fundamental objectives that motivated the Founder to establish the School, i.e. to train suitable candidates for the work of the Church is manifestly being realised to the Glory of God.\n\nThough many of the older generation of Old Boys in the priesthood have retired from active service, due to age or infirmity, several of them form a pool of Extra Parochial Priests whose services are still available to the Church in their localities. In place of those retired priests, there has arisen a new crop of youthful, active, forward-looking priests many of them graduates from the universities and theological colleges both in and outside the country.\n\nThe lure of the priesthood seems to hold fascination for some of the Old Boys of the School. Joseph Agyeman Duah, an Ashanti-Mampong royal, for example, recently exchanged in the words of the \"Pioneer\" the `Silver Stool for the Silver Chalice', a step that means, in effect, giving up, at least temporarily, his right of succession to the Silver Stool of Mampong.\n\nThe Revd. Fr. Agyeman Duah, a chartered accountant by profession was, before his ordination, serving as Accountant/Financial Secretary at the Asantehene's Secretariat in Kumasi. The new Priest was a foundation member of the St. Nicholas Choir during his student days at Adisadel in 1944 and apart from serving as a chorister at St. Cyprian's Church, Kumasi for 25 years he went through the Order of Readers in the Diocese of Accra in 1968, before being admitted to the Associate of the Anglican Order of the Holy Cross in 1976, subsequently becoming a full Priest of the Church in September 1977.\n\nApart from C. H. Elliott, H. Tekyi-Mensah, L.Th., and K. P. Sakyiama, all former Archdeacons, now on retirement, the other older priest still in active service is the Venerable A. Dawson-Amoah. Of the present generation of Old Santaclausian priests and those who have close associations with the School, one way or the other, may be named: the Venerable Edmund Yeboah. B.D., A.K.C., M.A. Archdeacon of Cape Coast, formerly lecturer in Theology, Trinity College, Legon; Revd. Canon Leo Ankrah. B.Sc., (Econ.) B.Th., formerly Presentor, Holy Trinity Cathedral and Diocesan Accountant. (Canon Ankrah who is now Headmaster of Achimota School was at one time Chaplain of Adisadel College).\n\nThe others are the Venerable (Lt.-Col:) J. K. Dadson, B.A. (HODS.) Legon, M.A., (Long Island University, New York, (U.S.A.,) Archdeacon of Accra and Chaplain-General of the Ghana Armed Forces; Revd. Fr. T. S. A. Annobil, MLA., L.Th., Trinity College, Legon; Revd., Fr. A. E, Asmah, B.A., Priest-in-Charge of St. Paul's Labadi, Accra (formerly Comptroller of Customs and Excise) Revd. Fr. E. K. T. Arhin and Revd. Fr. J. A. Ackon, Dip. Th., S.Th., Dip. Ed., (Lancaster) former Senior Chaplain and Chaplain respectively of Adisadel College. Revd. Ackon is now Presentor of the Cathedral Church of the Most Holy Trinity and Chaplain of Holy Trinity Cathedral Secondary School, Accra; Revd. Fr. R. C. A. Okine, B.Min., M.,A., Ed.S., Principal, Academy of Christ The King, Cape Coast, and Revd., Fr., P. D. Aggrey, B.D., Headmaster, Anglican Secondary School, Kumasi, both one-time Chaplain of Adisadel College; Revd. Fr. T. A. Brient, Chaplain, Wiawso Training College. Revd. Fr. B. J.A. Adjaayi, L.Th., B.Th., and Revd. Fr. D. S. A. Allotey, B.A., Senior Chaplain and Chaplain respectively of Adisadel College.\n\n\"Once a clergyman, always a clergyman\". Those faithful servants of God, appear so much absorbed in their work in the Master's Vineyard as if to say with Pret Hart:\n\n\"I'm proud to live in the service of the Lord\n\nAnd I'm bound to die in His ArmyÂ”!\n\nOld Boys of the School are also serving as Diocesan officials. These include E. Brite-Gaisie, LL.B. Barrister-at-Law, S. H. Annancy, LL.B., Barrister-at-Law, who are Registrar and Assistant Registrar respectively of the Accra Diocese. (Barrister Annancy is now Regional Commissioner for the Eastern Region). W. S. Swatson, hon. Assistant Diocesan Accountant, formerly Chief Accountant, Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, G. K. Sam Amayih, former General Manager of the Anglican Church Educational Unit (ACEU) and now Ghana Representative of Rapid Results College London, J.O. Ayeh, General Manager of ACEU and J. A, Dennis, Diocesan and Synod Secretary, formerly Principal Secretary, Ministry of the Interior.\n\nBarrister James Mercer, a strong pillar of the Church, has served in several important capacities notably as Chancellor and Diocesan Registrar. Several Old Santaclausians are also ministers of other Churches among them the Revd. I. Aggrey Smith M.A. B.D.. who is Bishop's Deputy and Presiding Elder of the A.M.E. Zion Church, Cape Coast, and formerly Principal of Tafo Teacher Training College. Revd. J. S. Hutchful is the minister in charge of the Methodist Church, Ho. Before his ordination into the ministry, he was Chief Accountant, Accountant General's Department.\n\nAs their varied careers show, Old Boys of Adisadel have played and continue to play active and fruitful roles in the affairs of both the Church and the State.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nAdisadel Old Boys Association (AOBA)\n\nRemarkably, Old Boys of Adisadel College have an unusually strong, nostalgic, if sentimental, attachment to their Alma Mater. A healthy espirit de corps keeps them ever alive to their responsibilities to their Old School, through the Adisadel Old Boys Association (AOBA) branches of which exist in the regional capitals. The AOBA is a voluntary social organisation for all those who have attended the School and serves the purposes of bringing the Old Boys together to discuss matters of common interest and find ways, and means of strengthening their links with the School, and helping in every possible way, to maintain the momentum of life and traditions of the School.\n\nIn addition to voluntary contributions by the Old Boys, the Association organises social functions so as to raise funds to meet essential needs of the School, such as the provision of science and sports equipment; books and other prizes for distribution to deserving students during Speech and Prize-Giving Day.\n\nThere is also an Adisadel College Endowment Fund which is always open and to which Old Boys as well as well wishers of the School can make contributions. The Fund has been instituted for the purpose of financing needful projects at the School including the award of ad hoc bursaries to bright but needy students who are deserving of financial assistance in some way, to enable them to continue their education in the School.\n\nThe welfare of the staff and the students is as much the concern of the College Management Committee as it is of the Adisadel Old Boys Association. It is usually a matter given much thought at regular meetings of the Association. For instance, at an important meeting convened at Adisadel at the instance of the National Chairman, Dr. Robert Gardiner, just before the Speech and Prize-Giving Ceremony at the Great Hall on March 4, 1978, the main subject discussed centred on the welfare of the staff and students. And as should be expected, far-reaching decisions were taken not only in the interests of the staff and students in particular but also of the School generally. The problem of feeding the students in the light of the economic situation in the country, the awards of scholarship; and bursaries engaged the attention of the meeting, which was attended by many Old Boys mostly parents and guardians of the students who are concerned about the situation.\n\nIt is heartening that Old Boys of Adisadel have never been found wanting in giving practical expressions to their love for their Alma Mater and also in seeking the welfare of the staff and students.\n\nWillie C. Tandoh beautifully dramatised his great love for his Alma Mater when he donated the sum of C5.000.00 (five thousand cedis) for the equipment of the School Laboratory in addition to undertaking on behalf of himself and his company, to sponsor the establishment of a Trade School at Adisadel. This took place when he was the Guest Speaker at the College Speech and Prize-Giving Day held on March 11, 1977. The gist of his speech delivered on that occasion is given elsewhere (see Appendix VII).\n\nIsaac B. Phillips had also the honour of being the Guest Speaker, for the 1978 Speech and Prize-Giving Day ceremony, held on March 4 1978. And as is typical of him, after an illuminating speech in which he exhorted the students to endeavour to live up to all expectations both at work and play and thus add to the achievements and glories of the School, he made a handsome donation of C5,000.00 (five thousand cedis) to the School in addition to presenting a fat live cow to provide a feast for the staff and students to mark that occasion.\n\nThere is yet another evidence of Isaac Phillips altruistic spirit worth recording here. As the head of a local firm of launderers and dry cleaners - The Wiseway Cleaners Limited - Buck Phillips has taken a stake in the personal cleanliness of the boys at Adisadel. He has endeavoured to promote in the School the essence of personal cleanliness and clean living. Apart from offering prizes of books for the \"Cleaniest Boy\" competition which he has instituted in the School, he has also donated a Silver Cup for an annual Inter-House Cleaning Competition, which is still keenly competed for by the various School Houses.\n\nThe Roman adage, Mens Sana In Corporis Sano, the principle of sound mind in a healthy body has a strong educational appeal to people all over the world. It is encouraging that this ideal of healthy living is being given practical meaning at Adisadel in this novel way, thanks to the initiative and generosity of a remarkable Old Boy of the School.\n\nIronically, Isaac Buck Phillips was one of the students of Adisadel College who were dismissed from the School by the Colonial Government for their part in organising the massive students' strike in protest against the arrest and detention of THE BIG SIX in 1948.\n\nHe was convinced of the justness of the students' stand in supporting the cause of the country. He never regretted the steps he took and bears no one any grudge for his dismissal from the School. Rather he prides himself on the personal sacrifices which he and the others made which helped to accelerate the pace of freedom and self-government for the country, consequently ending colonial rule for all time in this country. He uses to say that lovers of freedom will always be free whatever the cost!\n\nRe-assuringly, Isaac Phillips attachment to his Old School is as deep and strong as ever to the extent that he tends to be solicitious about the welfare of the School and the students. Adisadel College, undoubtedly, has a soft spot in his heart and he delights to recall, with evident nostalgia, his student days at `Adisco', even though it was all but for a short period!\n\nJames Mercer is yet another outstanding Old Santaclausians who deserves equally honourable mention here for his generosity, and great love for his Alma Mater. As a benefactor of the School, he has devoted much of his time, energy and resources in the service of his Alma Mater and no less of the Church.\n\nIt will be recalled that in 1960, when the School celebrated the Golden Jubilee of its foundation, James Mercer chose to put up at his own expenses two decorative iron gates at the entrance to the School, to give dignity to the College and also enhance the occasion. Recently, he presented to the School, 12 collarettes for the use of the School Choir. These are examples of his numerous acts of generosity to both the College and the students.\n\nThe extent of the love that the Old Boys have for their Alma Mater is seen in various practical forms. Characteristically, S. E. Quarm while serving as Ghana Ambassador to the United States of America, generated American public interest in Adisadel. The happy outcome was that a 5,000-dollar jazz band equipment was donated to the School by an American philanthropist, William Wallace. In appreciation of his generosity, William Wallace has deservingly been elected a honorary member of the College. Thus, while in the States, Sammy (as he is affectionately called by his numerous friends) who is a true-blue Old Santaclausian did much to \"sell\" not only Ghana but also Adisadel College to the American public with fruitful results.\n\nThe publication of this book has been made possible thanks to the generosity of the Old Boys individually and collectively. The enthusiastic manner in which they responded to my appeal for funds surpassed my sanguine expectations. It was great and kind of them all for their wonderful gesture of encouragement and support in this venture. I am most grateful and indebted to them, all.\n\nAdisadel is proud of her distinguished Old Boys who have given years of faithful services to the country and thus by their examples and dedication, helped to \"gild the School with their fame.\"\n\nStudents of the School who pass out each year to join the happy Old Santaclausian Family should take inspiration from the zeal and dedication of those \"gone before\" and \"do exploits to add to their gain.\" They should always be conscious of their obligation and duty to their Alma Mater and help maintain the School's great traditions and achievements.\n\nAnd now Fellow Santaclausians young and old, let's stand up to honour, and toast the health of the Good Old School and lustily sing our inspirational refrain:\n\nPlay up, play up Santaclausians!\n\nPlay up and play the game!\n\nGive nothing but your best\n\nAnd never think of rest\n\nPlay up for the School's great name!\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nHonours And Awards\n\nA comparative study of national and international honours and awards so far as Old Santaclausians are concerned reveals that Adisadel has something impressive to show. In the academic fields and in the public services, the honours achieved by the Old Boys have justified the School motto: Vel Primus Vel Cum Primis in a practical way.\n\nIn the colonial days, Old Santaclausians gave dedicated and responsible public services that won them laudable commendations and honours ranging from the Knighthood down to various orders of the British Empire.\n\nOne of the Foundation Scholars, G. C. Mends, is on record as having risen to the position of Assistant Colonial Secretary in the Nigerian Civil Service in the 1940's and retired with an award of O.B.E. for \"distinguished service\", being probably the first African to achieve such honours in that country.\n\nLegislators, prominent among them, Nana Sir Tsibu Darku X, Omanhene of Assin Attandaso and the late Sir Edward O. Asafu-Adjaye, who later become Ghana High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland received the Knighthood while others, notably, Nene Azzu Mate Kole, Konor of Manya Krobo, Odumase and the late Nana Amanfi III, Omanhene of Asebu were awarded the O.B.E. and C.B.E. respectively, all for their leadership and devotion to public duty. W. F. Coleman had M.B.E. and later G.M. for service to Broadcasting.\n\nLt.-Gen. Akwasi Afrifa was honoured by the State with the insignia of the Most Distinguished Order of Commander of the Volta (C.V.) and also awarded the Distinguished Service Order, D.S.O. (Military) and later installed Okatakyie by the Asanteman Council for bravery and valour. The University of Ghana also conferred on the General an honorary doctorate degree of Doctor of Laws (L.L.D.) for scholarship and valour. Similarly, Nene Azzu Mate Kole had L.L.D. for Â“statesmanshipÂ”.\n\nThe University of Cape Coast similarly conferred on Nana Sir Tsibu Darku X, O.B.E., Omanhene of Assin Attandaso Traditional area, the honorary doctorate degree of Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) for his past distinguished public services as a Legislator and Elder Statesman. Dr. Robert Gardiner was likewise honoured with an award of D. Litt. (honoris causa) by the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, for his scholarship and dedicated service to Africa.\n\nThe same spirit of public service continues to animate other Old Boys in various positions of trust and responsibility. Again, Dr. Robert Gardiner former Commissioner for Economic Planning and Nana Fredua Mensah were awarded the insignias of the Most Distinguished Order of the Volta (CV) and the Grand Medal (GM) respectively, in the national awards marking Ghana's 21st Independence Anniversary in March 1978. The former for service to the nation in the field of economics and, the latter for his contribution to the development of transportation in the country.\n\nIn the 1979 Ghana Independence Anniversary awards, the Rt. Revd. I.S.M. LeMaire, Bishop of Accra, was the recipient of the Grand Medal (G.M.) while S. C. A. Chinery was appointed Member of the Order of the Volta (MV). Bishop LeMaire who happily is the Chairman of the College Management Committee is well known for his ethical and religious zeal and earlier in 1976, the honorary doctorate degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) had been conferred on him by Cuttington university in Liberia. Amu Chinery (Head Prefect, 1943) is an administrator of considerable experience and standing having retired as Deputy Head of the Civil Service after over 30 years devoted service to the country.\n\nAcademically, at Oxford and Cambridge, two scholars of Adisadel became the first Africans to be elected Fellows in these ancient British universities. Professor W. E. Abraham, at All Souls College, Oxford, and Professor J. A. K. Quartey, at Churchill College, Cambridge. Dr. Robert Gardiner is also a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. Fellows at the University institutions are learned men of proven scholarship and merit.\n\nRecently, too, both Robert Gardiner and David Andoh had the honour of being among the first to be elected honorary Fellows of the Ghana Institute of Management. As already mentioned elsewhere, Dr. Gardiner has been awarded many honorary doctorate degrees by various universities including the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi for his services to Africa and the international community which he had served so well. It is interesting to note that both David Andoh and Dr. Robert Gardiner served, successively, for sometime as Chairman of the University Council, University of Ghana, Legon. David Andoh is currently Chairman of the Council of the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi. He delivered the 1978 Alumni Lectures of the University of Ghana, Legon. His subject was: \"The Private Sector: A Case \".\n\nAnd significantly, too, yet another Old Boy, Dr. C. A. Ackah, first Ghanaian Principal of the erstwhile University College of Cape Coast, was awarded the honorary doctorate degree of D. Litt. by the University of Cape Coast. Dr. Ackah who had spent almost all his working life in the education of the youth of this country, had the honour and privilege of starting and nursing that University College, and it is his pioneering achievement that has resulted in its present status as a fully edged University. It was in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the development of higher education in the country that Dr. Ackah was awarded the honorary D. Litt. degree.\n\nThen there is the scholar, K. O. Hagan who created history as the first Ghanaian who without previously taking a degree, successfully, made a `shot' at the coveted B. Litt. degree at Oxford. Kwa Hagan was the first and for many years, the National Secretary of the People's Educational Association of Ghana (PEA) and later the Deputy Director of the Institute of Public Education, University of Ghana. `\n\nIn the 1960's he served on the UNESCO 24-member International Committee for the advancement of Adult Education at UNESCO, Paris, France and in that capaciiy, he represented the English speaking countries of Africa on that Committee. He was also a member of the UNESCO International Committee of Experts on Literacy. Kwa Hagan was also in the sixties, the Chairman of the Specialised Committee on Adult Education of the World Federation of the Organisation of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP) in Washington DC, USA. Other members of the Committee were acknowledged adult educationalists drawn from Europe North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia.\n\nAdisadel has indeed every reason to be proud of her scholars and men of affairs for the honour they have brought to themselves, the School and the country. It is to be hoped that their achievements, great zeal and dedication will inspire the rising generations of students to emulate their fine examples."
