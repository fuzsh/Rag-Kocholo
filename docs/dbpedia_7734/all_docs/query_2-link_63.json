Among them was fighting for Equality as well as encouraging Peacekeeping. One remarkable legacy was championing reforms at the UN. During an engagement with the Founder and Chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Dr Mo Ibrahim, Mr Annan acknowledged that the task of reforming the UN was enormous since the organisation was a complex one. The Late Kofi Annan, was also a strong voice against African leaders who entrenched themselves in power. To him, leaders must not always have their way but pause to listen to the ordinary citizen as well. During a recent engagement with Alumni of his Alma Mater Mfantsipim School, Mr Annan, said it is a shame to seek to remain in power indefinitely, citing countries like Uganda, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, and Cameroon. Mr Kofi Annan died at a hospital in Switzerland, Saturday morning after short illness. He was 80. He served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. He is the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders, an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela."
