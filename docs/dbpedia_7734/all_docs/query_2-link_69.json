        "text": "The University of California at Los Angeles has announced a record $25 million gift commitment for its department of history.\n\nThe gift, the largest-ever single donation to the department and to the UCLA College Division of Social Sciences, was made by Meyer Luskin and his wife, Renee. In recognition of the historic pledge, the university will name the department of history in their honor.\n\n“Meyer and Renee Luskin are cherished members of our Bruin family who have long helped UCLA live up to its highest ideals, changing countless lives through their generosity and leadership,” said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block in the university’s press release. “This visionary gift speaks volumes about their dedication to our academic community and their recognition that both UCLA students and the general public benefit greatly from a rich understanding of history.”\n\nIn addition to providing support for students, faculty and early-career scholars, the gift will support the expansion of the department’s public-facing centers and programs. These include the Luskin Center for History and Policy, the Public History Initiative, the “Why History Matters” series and the “Making History in Los Angeles” program.\n\n“We believe the study of history is vital in creating informed participants in a vibrant democratic society,” Meyer Luskin said, in the university announcement. “This gift will ensure that students and faculty have ample resources and opportunities to study the past, which will allow them to further understanding of the present in service to the public good.”\n\n“To understand and nurture the values that lay at the foundation of our democracy, it is essential to mine the past as a guide to a better future,” Renee Luskin added. “Such knowledge can aid in solving some of our world’s biggest challenges.”\n\nMeyer Luskin earned his bachelor’s degree in economics in 1949 from UCLA, and Renee received a bachelor’s in sociology from the university in 1953. Meyer went on to earn a Masters in Business Administration from Stanford University. In the 1950s, he founded Scope Industries, which became a leader in the recycling and processing of food waste. He has served as its president, CEO and chairman.\n\nThe Luskins have a long history of major philanthropy for their alma mater. They made a $5 million donation in 2017 for the creation of the UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy. It has become a leading center for using history to address major policy issues and bring the study of history into public life.\n\nIn 2011, they donated $100 million to support several academic programs and capital improvements. The gift was equally divided between the UCLA School of Public Affairs, which was renamed in their honor, and the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center, which opened in 2016.\n\nThat gift also established the annual Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership, which has included speakers such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution Lonnie Bunch III, and former National Science Foundation Director France Córdova.\n\nAccording to the university, Meyer Luskin said an impetus for the couple’s years of philanthropic support for UCLA was a $30 scholarship he received, which allowed him to continue his university studies after they were interrupted by his military service in World War II."
