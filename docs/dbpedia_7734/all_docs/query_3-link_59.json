        "text": "The Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), Kofi Annan, addressed the closing session of the Millennium Summit in New York on September 8th. He expressed appreciation to the 160 chiefs of state and heads of government for the Declaration they adopted defining the goals to be achieved in the next 15 years—by 2015. Their Declaration said that it is intolerable that millions of innocent people, especially women and children, should still fall victim to brutal conflict. It reaffirmed the vital importance of international law; it called for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council and for action and results to make the United Nations more effective.\n\nKofi Annan then spoke these crucial words to the assembled member states, words which are basic to any hope or possibility of making the UN more relevant and effective: “...You are yourselves the United Nations. It lies in your power, and therefore it is your responsibility, to reach the goals you have defined. Only you can determine whether the United Nations rises to the challenge...”\n\nThe Secretary-General has wisely welcomed and promoted growing links with international business and with non-governmental organizations that give hope of a constituency of support that the UN desperately needs. But it is the 189 member states that are in fact the United Nations; their governments must determine if the UN will be an important instrument of international governance. The great power and energy of the United States (US) is not available to lead this historic mission. We can regret that reality but we must confront it—and the results of the presidential elections in November will not change that reality.\n\nIn this paper, I will discuss the future of the UN in the context of the United States and the European Union (EU). I will argue that America’s faltering and provocatively negative role in the UN can now be transformed into opportunity by the European Union—an opportunity to bring the economic and military power of the member states of the European Union together for a universal purpose and in so doing give form and substance to the new Europe—an opportunity for the European Union to offer the leadership that is desperately needed and that the United States cannot presently give. The strategic and diplomatic decisions are complicated. They need intense effort and commitment by the European Union to be formulated and executed. If the EU accepts the challenge and carries it out successfully, it will give the 21st century an incomparable prospect of peace, purpose, and historic progress in achieving social justice.\n\nLet me begin by discussing the American relationship to the United Nations. It is important to understand some fundamentals as to how our government works. The US is not a parliamentary democracy where the executive power is an extension of the legislative power. We are a constitutional republic, founded by men whom experience and learning had taught to be distrustful of power, especially the concentration of power. The result is a commitment to the concept of balance of power with three branches of government—the executive, legislative and judicial, given express and implied powers, which 210 years of experience as a nation have defined, enlarged, and distilled. It is a remarkable system and it works for our country, now the oldest constitutional democracy in the world. Protected and isolated by two oceans, America has lived its history free of the destructive violence of foreign enemies that has diminished and destroyed other nations. Now, for more than 50 years, America has been the dominant military, economic and political force in the world. It reluctantly accepted the responsibility of international leadership. It has certainly been as generous and benign as any predecessor nation in world history, which has had its opportunity of power and leadership. Self-interest, national interest, sometimes arrogant self-confidence have all been a part of its decisions affecting other nations, but it has responded greatly to the challenges to humanity and democracy in the 20th century.\n\nThe relationship of the US to the UN since its founding has been creative, intense, often supportive, frequently insulting, sometimes disruptive, often undiplomatic, and increasingly destructive. The Americans who participated in the creation of the United Nations were tough, pragmatic politicians who, having witnessed the collapse of the League of Nations, were determined to avoid its weaknesses, yet build upon its ideals. The terrible cost to humanity—in life, in wealth, in spiritual values—of the Second World War and the advent of the nuclear age made age-old ideals of international governance into pragmatic necessities. The Holocaust showed us the depth of human evil. The Second World War cost more than 60 million lives, an overwhelming percentage of them innocent civilian lives. The great cities and countryside of Europe and Asia lay in the ashes of horrific destruction. The nuclear age provided the curtain to this awful episode of history. For the first time Mankind had a capacity to destroy itself and to make the world uninhabitable. The world was blessed to have an extraordinary generation of men and women of ideals and vision available to it.\n\nThe United Nations was the last great achievement of the President whom most agree was the greatest American leader of the 20th century. Franklin Roosevelt understood the history of American isolationism and the powerful forces that would resist US participation in international organizations. He was determined to avoid the political mistakes of Woodrow Wilson, creating a universal organization which would bring all nations together but where the most powerful nations, designated as permanent members of the Security Council, had a special responsibility for collective security and the obligations of the UN Charter. The Charter was not done by decrees from heaven. It was carefully crafted, with national interests and attitudes often in conflict. There was endless negotiation of the various proposals even as the war continued. Idealism and cynicism confronted each other but in the end, an intelligent, pragmatic, imperfect agreement was negotiated. In the midst of hope and with the echo of every political argument that still has resonance today, the UN Charter was adopted. The founders understood that a civil society needs to be built on law and order—that civilization needs a policeman. Since no single nation—and certainly not the United States—wanted to be that policeman, the Security Council was organized to carry out an important part of that responsibility through collective action. The Charter became an instrument by which the principle of self-determination could be realized. It insisted on respect for human rights, and encouraged economic, social, cultural and humanitarian cooperation among all nations. And every nation was signatory to that Charter—51 in 1945, 189 today. The founders knew—and we know—the gross imperfections of the world but they knew—and we know—what had to be done to make it better.\n\nAmerica made its commitment in 1945. President Harry Truman expressed it in his address to the delegates in San Francisco who adopted the Charter of the United Nations:\n\n“If we fail to use the Charter and the organization that we have created with it, we shall betray all of those who have died in order that we might meet here in freedom and in safety to create it. If we seek to use it selfishly for the advantage of one nation or small group of nations, we shall be equally guilty of that betrayal, but what a great day in history this can be. This Charter is no more perfect than our own constitution, but like the constitution it must be made to live. The powerful nations must accept the responsibility for leadership toward a world of peace.”\n\nSitting at President Truman’s right hand was Arthur Vandenberg, the most powerful Republican member of the Senate of the United States. This was not the commitment of a party or of a person. This was a commitment of a nation, proposed by its President and ratified by the Senate in the solemn manner ordained by our Constitution. Only two members of the Senate voted in opposition. The United States understood that it had to lead in organizing the community of nations if the United Nations was to succeed.\n\nThe depth and continuance of that commitment is a decision that each generation must make anew. Is the United Nations an instrument of international governance that serves American interests? Germany’s interests? Europe’s interests? The interests of the Atlantic community? Not to mention the countries separated from us by ideology and poverty and systemic failure? The question presupposes that we know what those interests are. Let us frame the question in terms of the countries of the Atlantic Alliance both individually and collectively. Is the international control of nuclear proliferation in our interest? Were their interests served by de-colonization, a process that has taken place for the most part peacefully because the United Nations served as the bridge that old Empires could cross so that new nations would emerge? Is it in their interest to advance the Rule of Law, to encourage respect for human rights, to ameliorate humanitarian crises so that the millions of refugees wandering the earth, devastated by famine and despair, have at least the option of surviving and resettling in their own countries and regions?\n\nAnd what does UN peacekeeping and peacemaking mean to their interests? Let us consider only some of the interventions since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Consider Cambodia, where in the 1970s the world witnessed the killing fields where two million innocent people were murdered and did nothing to stop the slaughter. Because of United Nations intervention, because of the end of the Cold War, because of the leadership of Australia and Japan, because of the support of the European Union and the United States, the violence has ended in Cambodia and there is hope for democracy. A United Nations force did not liberate South Africa, but its condemnation of Apartheid and its sanctions helped force the release of Nelson Mandela, a transforming event in the history of South Africa.\n\nAmericans especially should remember what peace in El Salvador means, having spent billions of dollars taking sides in a civil war that cost the lives of 80,000 people— 80,000 dead in one decade in one small Central American country in our own hemisphere. Was it in our interest to have the diplomatic intervention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that brought an end to that struggle?\n\nHow could Iraq’s aggression have been repulsed and the principle of collective security sustained without a Security Council mandate which allowed both Arab nations and Israel to support the liberation of Kuwait—and which made its $100 billion cost a shared responsibility? In 1992, American forces, under the flag of the UN, brought a quick end to the suffering in Somalia where 400,000 people a year were dying of starvation. The mismanagement of the subsequent military role by both the UN and the US in Somalia, instead of being a painful lesson in future preparations and restraints, became a political liability that President Clinton was unwilling to accept, permitting the UN to become the scapegoat of defeat.\n\nWhen the crisis exploded in Bosnia, none of our countries wanted to face the costs of peace, costs that Benjamin Disraeli calculated with extraordinary precision 114 years before. In a speech in 1878 in the House of Lords, Prime Minister Disraeli said: “No language can describe adequately the condition of that portion of the Balkan Peninsula— Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina. No words can describe the political intrigue, the constant rivalries, a total absence of all public spirit, a hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions, absence of any controlling power. Nothing short,” Disraeli said, “of an army of 50,000 of Europe’s best troops would produce anything like order in those parts.” We have seen the Serbs and the Croats and the Muslims kill each other with heartrending results six different times since 1878. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people have been murdered. In 1992, no country wanted to send their ground troops to be involved in another civil war among the Balkan nations. The United Nations was given an impossible mission. The Security Council sent unarmed peacekeepers into a shooting war with a mandate to be neutral in the face of criminal violence. Nevertheless, their very presence stopped the wholesale slaughter, which before their arrival had taken 250,000 lives. When the Security Council created the safe havens such as Sbrinica, it did the right thing. The obligation was to save innocent people. The concept was not wrong. The failure was the Security Council’s unwillingness to provide the resources to protect those safe havens despite the pleas of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali. The world was outraged by the massacre at Sbrinica. The UN Secretariat, as its recent reports candidly state, bears an important responsibility but the Security Council, which refused it the proper mandate and resources also bears the responsibility. The Dayton Accord, brilliantly negotiated by Richard Holbrooke, brought an end to the fighting. But peace is a process, not an event. The Balkan cauldron seethes with 600 years of hatred. The United Nations can have a critical role in reconciling ancient enemies and building the framework of a civil society. But this is the work of a generation and undoubtedly longer—and the very possibility of success depends on dedicated leadership, such as that being provided by Bernard Kouchner, and a willingness of Europe and America to make the necessary resources available.\n\nRonald Reagan in a speech at Oxford University in December 1992 spoke to the future of the United Nations:\n\n“And now the United Nations has been liberated by the end of the Cold War. We are at last able to recognize the vision of its founding fathers. Just as the world’s democracies banded together to advance the cause of freedom in the face of totalitarianism, might we not now unite to impose civilized standards of behavior on those who flout every measure of human decency? Are we not nearing a point in world history where civilized nations can in unison stand up to the most immoral and deadly excesses against humanity?”"
