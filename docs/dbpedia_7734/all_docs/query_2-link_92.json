Along with her polished sales skills, tough negotiating style, attention to detail, and innovative marketing ideas, she has managed to combine her extensive relationships within the broker community to consistently close deals no matter how impossible they seem during the selling and buying process. Working as a true entrepreneur, Juliette has the ability to create new and interesting ways of marketing properties throughout the Southland.\n\nAn admitted “houseaholic,” Juliette Hohnen’s true passion is real estate. Born in London, she studied interior design at The Inchbald School of Art and Design. Applying her talent for multi-tasking and her ability to see the next big trends, she has bought, renovated and sold houses on both U.S. coasts. Many of her designs, which cover a breadth of styles, have been featured in multiple magazines of note. Before real estate Juliette had a 15-year career as an award-winning television producer and journalist. She ran the West Coast Bureau of MTV where she produced their movie programming. Juliette was also an on-camera reporter for MTV news, and reporter and producer of The Big Picture.

As a grant maker she served 6 years as senior dance program specialist and site visit coordinator for the National Endowment for the Arts. In the corporate world she worked as a civil litigator for the law firm of Holland and Knight; as a corporate director for Just Toys, Inc.; as vice president of business affairs for de Passe Entertainment; and, as director of show development for Disney Entertainment Productions. However, Charmaine’s strongest passions have always been for the arts, culture and public service. She served 6 years as deputy and acting commissioner of New York City’s Department of Cultural Affairs where she helped manage the agency through significant city budget cuts, an expanded capital construction program, a public relations initiative, and the installation of arts education programs for children living in temporary housing. She served 6 years as executive director of Dance Theatre of Harlem helming that institution’s $7.8m capital expansion, company national and international tours, school operations, fundraising, marketing and board relations.\n\nCharmaine recently completed 11 years of dual service as the executive director of the state-agency California African American Museum (CAAM) in Los Angeles and vice president of its nonprofit partner Friends, the Foundation of the California African American Museum. Her tenure developed relationships for CAAM with numerous community based organizations to create shared programming opportunities, nationally shared exhibits, and completed plans for a $60M CAAM capital expansion through schematics. Despite significant state budget cuts caused by the recession, exhibit presentations rose from 6 to 13 annually. She conceived several exhibitions including The African Diaspora in the Work of Miguel Covarrubias, and the Getty’s “Pacific Standard Time” sponsored exhibition of more than 90 Los Angeles artists in Places of Validation, Art & Progression. She fostered exhibit collaborations with other museums including An Idea Called Tomorrow with the Skirball Cultural Center; Things That Cannot Be Seen Any Other Way: The Art Of Manuel Mendive in association with the City of Los Angeles and The Frost Museum; and A Memoir in Movement: Carmen de Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder with the DuSable Museum. During her tenure, CAAM’s annual attendance increased 68% to 100,000 and free public workshops and programs rose from 35 to 80 including the branding of the highly popular monthly “Target Sundays at CAAM” live performances. Charmaine is particularly proud of having implemented a strategic vision for “Mentoring Generations” that enhanced CAAM’s ability to give back to the community. She increased its “Buses & Docents” school field trip support, and expanded the “Young Docents” high school employment training from summer only to a year round program with student access through their first two years of college. In 2013, the Friends Foundation linked Young Docents to the City of Los Angeles’ youth employment program creating greater access for youth living in and transitioning out of foster care, encouraging the pursuit of a college education, and providing opportunities for access to paid employment and customer service experiences.\n\nCharmaine remains a staunch community advocate and arts expert, serving nonprofits through Kélan Resources, her cause driven consulting firm dedicated to integrating art, history, culture, business and diversity into the DNA of education, community, philanthropy, and public and private collaborations. A partial list of recent clients include the Tom & Ethel Bradley Foundation, Lula Washington Contemporary Dance Theatre, Rain Art Productions, Pasadena Playhouse and Opera Noir. Charmaine is equally active as a volunteer having served on innumerable boards and commissions throughout her career. She recently completed 8 years of gubernatorial appointments on the California Arts Council. She continues to serve on the Board of Directors of Arts for LA, as a college trustee and academic committee chair for the California Institute of the Arts, as a mayoral appointee and vice chair of the City of Los Angeles’ Cultural Affairs Commission, on the African American Advisory Council for PBS SoCal, and on the Advisory Committee for the Los Angeles County Cultural Affairs Commission’s “Cultural Equity and Inclusion Initiative.”\n\nPAIGE LAURIE\n\nPaige Laurie is the owner of Malibu’s Trancas Country Market and Vintage Grocers, a uniquely curated grocery store experience in the Los Angeles area.\n\nLaurie’s concept for Vintage Grocers – rooted in her conviction that a market should embrace all customers’ food beliefs – was first realized in 2014 with the opening of Vintage Grocers in Malibu, and followed by the 2016 launch of a second location in Westlake Village. The third Vintage Grocers store will open in Pacific Palisades in 2018.\n\nIn line with her entrepreneurial nature, Laurie has developed a hotel, commercial mixed-use centers, and restaurants in Florida, Illinois and Missouri. She also owns and manages commercial and rental properties throughout Southern California. One of those holdings, Trancas Country Market, is Malibu’s premier shopping destination, and home to the debut location of Vintage Grocers. Sensitive to the unique spirit of Malibu, Laurie has built on the success of Vintage Grocers by partnering with a cohesive mix of retailers for Trancas, including artisanal brands native to the area, as well boutiques and designer stores. Laurie is further enhancing the grounds with other attractions such as a local garden nursery, an open-air commons, and revamped restaurant offerings.\n\nLaurie’s knack for retail and property development is heavily influenced by her childhood, as she was immersed in her parents’ businesses from an early age. The knowledge she gained provided her with an innate understanding of the consumer landscape as it applies to demographics and lifestyles today. She is committed to improving the communities in which her markets are located.\n\nLaurie also has a passion for the arts, fashion, design, and travel. She grew up in Columbia, Missouri and has lived in Los Angeles for over 16 years.\n\nERIN MARTIN\n\nErin Martin is an entrepreneurial storyteller with 30 years of diverse management, consulting and creative work experience in both the for-profit and non-profit worlds.
