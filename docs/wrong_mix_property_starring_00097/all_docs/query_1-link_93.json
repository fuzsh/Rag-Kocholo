        "text": "Original Mean Girls once again on big screens? That’s so fetch!\n\nOne of the OG cast members, Amanda Seyfried expressed her willingness to have a role in an upcoming musical version of one of the hit movies in the early 2000s, Mean Girls.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight during the red carpet at SAG Awards, the 37-year-old actress shared an update regarding being cast in the upcoming musical movie, noting that Reneé Rapp, who will play the role of Regina George wanted them to be part of the new film.\n\n“I’m still hoping for a miracle, it’s not really up to us,” she told ET, sharing that her other co-stars, Rachel McAdams, Lindsay Lohan, and Lacey Chabert wanted to have a cameo as well.\n\n“All of us are 100% into it,” she said. Seyfried noted, however, that she would not want to reprise the role, but instead, they would want to play roles of the new casts’ mothers.\n\n\"Maybe the mothers of our characters?\" she said. \"That's what I was thinking, but listen, I have not even seen the script.\"\n\nThe American teen movie film Mean Girls first premiered in 2004 and was written by Tina Fey, birthing iconic memes and looks. In 2020, the stars gave fans a surprise reunion through a Zoom call to encourage voting and tease the movie’s musical adaptation."
