We just did a version of it.\n\n\"And I had to keep that separate and remember it's a different version of Elizabeth Holmes.\n\n\"It's hard. There's a lot of iconic things about her that we had to capture, but at the end of the day, it's our version. And the audience was able to follow along.\"\n\nAnd Amanda was proud to have even been nominated for her work on the show.\n\nShe said: \"It's the most exciting thing. How could you not love people paying attention to you and with positive feedback?\n\n\"You don't do it for that, but when you get it, it's the cherry on the top of a really great job.\""
