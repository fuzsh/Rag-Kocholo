        "text": "Amanda Seyfried has moved on from her days as Sophie in the Mamma Mia franchise (at least for now), and in 2021, she earned her first Oscar nod, a nomination for Best Supporting Actress Oscar in the 2020 film Mank.\n\nWhen it comes to her personal life, Seyfried is pretty private, though she does post a lot of photos of her dog, Finn.\n\nBut she's got another big love in her life, her husband, Thomas Sadoski.\n\nIn 2013, Seyfried spoke to ELLE about her love life and the importance of sexual attraction in a relationship.\n\n\"Everybody I've dated I've been sexually attracted to immediately,\" she said then. \"Sparks don't grow—your vagina doesn't become more inclined to wanting someone just because you're around them.\" At the time, she spoke about the person ELLE identified as her \"crush\": \"[He's] someone separate from my industry life—I've known him since he was 16… I picture him as the father of my children all the time. But it is a fantasy right now.\"\n\nLater in 2013, Seyfried ended up dating actor Justin Long, but the two split in September 2015. \"He wanted to get married, she wasn't ready to make the commitment,\" a source told Page Six then, while adding that she might be starting something with a new partner.\n\nSeyfried and Sadoski met on the set of their first film, The Way We Get By (2009), and by March 2016, they were a confirmed item. They were engaged by September 2016 and by early 2017, they were expecting their first child, their daughter, Nina.\n\nIn 2020, they shared that they had welcomed a son, Thomas. So, who is Seyfried's husband of four years and the father of her children? Here's what we know.\n\nHe grew up in Texas.\n\nPer WWD, Sadoski was born in Texas. When he was 4 years old, he and his parents moved to College Station, Texas, and by the time he was in high school, he knew he wanted to pursue acting. He tried college for three months: \"Things didn't really work out for me, and it didn’t really work out for them, so we had a mutual parting of ways.\" He moved to New York, where he studied at Circle in the Square Theatre School.\n\nHe's a professional actor.\n\nSadoski has spent much of his career onstage and got a Tony nomination for \"Reasons to Be Pretty\" (2009).\n\n\"For most of my career, I’ve held on really tightly trying to figure out what the hell I’m supposed to do next and controlling everything,\" he told WWD. \"I've gotten to a point in my life where I think that my job is to just follow the path that gets laid out in front of me.\"\n\nSadoski is most known for his role, Jon Keefer, in The Newsroom (2012-2014). You can also find him in John Wick (2014) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), the TV series The Slap (2015), and the series Life in Places (2015-2019). Here's his full IMDB for more.\n\nSeyfried is his second wife.\n\nBefore Seyfried, Sadoski was married to Kimberly Hope for what was reportedly eight years. The two split in 2015.\n\nIn 2018, that, when she met Sadoski on their off-Broadway play The Way We Get By, she noticed how respectful he was of his then-wife. She said they were friends at first, and when she had panic attacks onstage, he helped her through them.\n\n\"We were both in bad relationships,\" she said. She added that they \"never flirted, never disrespected his wife. That was another reason why I thought, later on, that I could marry him.\"\n\nWhen they were both out of their respective relationships, Seyfried suggested Sadoski for her love interest in her 2017 movie, The Last Word with Shirley MacLaine. It was then that their romantic relationship grew. \"It was amazing,\" Seyfried said. \"It felt healthy and freeing and clean. We can tell the story without any guilt.\"\n\nSeyfriend and Sadoski were married just before they welcomed their daughter. \"I really wanted to have rings on in the hospital, you know?\" she told PorterEdit “And what if something goes wrong, and he's not legally my husband?\" The magazine reports that she bought a dress at Free People, they got married in Topanga, California, and then they went to a favorite neighborhood café on Sunset Boulevard, Cheebo.\n\nNina was born less than two weeks later.\n\nHe stands up for what he knows is right.\n\nIn 2017, Seyfriend said Sadoski was fired from a job after he publicly supported Jessica Walter, who claimed she was \" \" by her Arrested Development co-star Jeffrey Tambor.\n\n\"Here's a somewhat recent post from my husband who, in return for standing beside a badass woman who’d recently been bullied, recently lost out on a job because of this,\" she wrote. \"I'd rather speak up and lose out. Integrity, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nThe original post from Sadoski read:\n\n\"This is Jessica Walter. She is a national goddamned treasure. It was an honor and a privilege to work with her. I don't give a fuck who you think you are or how good you think you are or how awesome you think your buddy/daddy is: screaming at someone isn't \"part of the business.\" It's bullshit. It's unhinged bullshit behavior and it has NEVER been acceptable. It wasn't cool in the 70's or 80's or whenthefuckever you \"came up.\" It was bullshit then, it is bullshit now. And excusing that kind of behavior is pathetic. Just pathetic. I worked in shitty greasy-spoon kitchens growing up: it wasn't acceptable behavior THERE and most of us were on HEAVY DRUGS. It certainly isn’t acceptable for some man-baby millionaire to do on a cozy ass tv show set. And it is even less acceptable for his male cast-mates to excuse it away IN FRONT OF THE PERSON THAT IT HAPPENED TO....(wait for it)....WHILE SHE IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HOW TRAUMATIZING THE EXPERIENCE WAS. What in the halfpenny fuck is happening?!\"\n\nHe loves being a dad.\n\nBack in 2017, Sadoski was admittedly \"terrified\" of becoming a parent, but he's since embraced the role. After the birth of his first daughter, he spoke to Fatherly about his favorite part of being a dad: \"When my daughter discovers something new. That’s the coolest thing in the world. That chokes me up every time she does it.\"\n\nHe uses his platform for good.\n\nSadoski and Seyfried are ambassadors for the nonprofit War Child, which assists children living in areas of conflict. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple led a huge donation campaign in support of the charity.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that there are people in this world who can literally not afford for the rest of us to turn a blind eye, and I don't mean afford in an economic sense, but I mean their lives are literally at stake,\" Sadoski told People. \"That's sort of why we're finding ourselves drawn specifically to this organization in this moment.\"\n\nSadoski added that fatherhood has inspired him to continue supporting War Child. \"I think all parents should be able to relate to the suffering of innocent children. It's just something that's deeply, inherently part of who we are—that we want to protect our little ones.\"\n\nSeyfried and Sadoski celebrated their fifth anniversary in 2022.\n\nSeyfried recognized the milestone on Instagram, where she shared photos of her and Sadoski with the caption \"Five fucking years.\"\n\nThe couple co-starred in The Crowded Room.\n\nSeyfried and Sadoski shared the screen in Apple TV+ series, The Crowded Rookm. The anthology's first season is inspired by Daniel Keyes' novel The Minds of Billy Milligan. Filming took place in 2022, and paparazzi managed to get snap some photos of Seyfried and Sadoski on set together.\n\nThe couple ultimately attended the premiere together in June 2023, marking a rare joint event for them:\n\nSeyfried and Sadoski largely keep their life private.\n\nSeyfried rarely shares photos of Sadoski on Instagram, choosing instead to keep posts focused on her work and animals she raises with him in their upstate New York farm. She gave a little look into her world on Jan. 1, 2024, writing, “God I am concerned and anxious about this new year but thankful so many things can be true at once. I also feel lucky that my starting off point is right here with my family (not pictured except for my dad and the mountains I call home).”\n\nSeyfried said that after starting a family with and marrying Sadoski, she is much more selective about her work."
