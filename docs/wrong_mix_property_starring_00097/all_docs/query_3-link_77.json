In the best supporting actor category, Heath Ledger and Ralph Richardson were nominated, with Ledger winning for “The Dark Knight” in 2009. 5 — African nations that have received nominations for best international feature, now that Tunisia has its first nominee, “The Man Who Sold His Skin.\" 4 — Nominations received by “Nomadland” director Chloé Zhao, a record for a woman in a record year for women. 1 — Man nominated for both best actor and best original song.\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 21, 2015 file photo, an Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)NEW YORK – Nominations to the 93rd Academy Awards on Monday will look — in more ways than one — unlike they ever have before. After a pandemic year that shuttered most movie theaters, the expected best-picture nominees will have hardly any box office to speak of. The most likely lead nominee Monday could be a traditional kind of Oscar movie: one about Hollywood. Viola Davis (“Ma Rainey”) could become the most nominated Black actress in Oscar history with four.\n\nZhao, the first woman of color nominated for best director, is the most nominated woman in a single year in Oscar history. She was also tipped for the film’s adapted screenplay, editing and as a producer in the best picture category. “I just quietly gave thanks and felt some gratitude.”Davis, who won for her performance in 2016’s “Fences,” landed her fourth Oscar nomination, making her the most nominated Black actress ever. The Academy Awards would typically have happened by now but this year will be telecast April 25. “Collective,” the Romanian documentary about investigative journalism and government corruption, became just the second film nominated for both best documentary and best international film.\n\nBill Murray poses for a portrait at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival in Toronto on Sepy.9, 2012, left, and Carey Mulligan poses for a portrait during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah on Jan. 25, 2020.

(Photos by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, left, and Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP)The Santa Barbara International Film Festival is always starry a celebration of up and coming filmmakers and Oscar hopefuls, but this year the programmers have also decided to make it more accessible. Virtuoso Award recipients include Riz Ahmed, Maria Bakalova, Kinglsey Ben-Adir, Andra Day, Sidney Flanigan, Vanessa Kirby, Tahar Rahim and Zendaya. AdThe Santa Barbara International Film Festival regularly attracts more than 100,000 attendees annually.\n\nThis image released by Altitude shows, from left, Kosar Ali, Ruby Stokes and Bukky Bakray in a scene from \"Rocks.\" Much like previous Academy Awards controversies, last year's nominations by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts were denounced for their all-male directing nominees and all-white acting nominees, a backlash that spawned a #BaftasSoWhite hashtag. The British academy responded with a seven-month review. Also nominated are Lee Isaac Chung for the family drama “Minari” and Thomas Vinterberg for the Danish dark comedy “Another Round.”More films were nominated, too. ___AP's Hilary Fox contributed to this report from London___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nWhile some people tune into the Golden Globe Awards to see what the best movies and shows are they should watch, many also tune in to see what everyone is wearing. This week on What’s the Buzz, Local 4 Style Editor Jon Jordan and The Michigan Chronical Editor AJ Williams gave their takes on the fashion hits and misses of the big night. Some looks they agreed on, like how actress/director Regina King sparkled in her one-shoulder black and silver dress. Both AJ and Jon had things to say about last night’s winner Jason Sudeikis’ tie-dye hoodie and Tina Fey’s unforgettable/forgettable dresses. Watch the video above to hear what Jon and AJ had to say about the fashion choices at the Golden Globes.\n\nAnd they were ready, style wise, as the Globes split hosts, with Amy Poehler at the Beverly Hilton and Tina Fey at the Rainbow Room in New York. Backstage after the show, Sudeikis told reporters he owns a multitude of hoodies but chose the one emblazoned with “Forward” on the front and “Listen + Lead” on the back as fitting for the unusual night. “I wanted to feel festive and go for it,” she told NBC. Sarah Paulson held her little black pooch on screen and Emma Corrin's fluffy white cat grabbed a moment for itself. AdLydia Marks, a New York set decorator, told The Associated Press the evening's technical challenges were many.\n\nThis image released by Searchlight Pictures shows Frances McDormand in a scene from the film \"Nomadland\" by Chloe Zhao. Here are our picks for the best movies of 2020:JAKE COYLE1. “David Byrne’s American Utopia”: Spike Lee’s fiction films make more noise but he’s quietly one of the best documentary filmmakers we have. He may have made the best film of the year in his short film “New York, New York,” a tribute to an undefeatable pandemic-stricken city. It's also, with a glorious rendering of Harlem, one of the best New York movies in years.\n\nBecause live shows aren’t really a thing in 2020, she’s launching a holiday TV special on Apple TV+ on Friday. “Mariah Carey’s Magical Christmas Special” will includes a mix of musical performances and dancing with amination. — Shawn Mendes released his debut album in 2015 and he’s dropping his fourth effort Friday. Along with the album is the Netflix documentary called “Shawn Mendes: In Wonder,” which is available for streaming and follows Mendes’ rise and journey over the last few years. — Christmas came early when Carrie Underwood released her first holiday album in September, and on Thursday she’ll debut a musical TV special to accompany the album."
