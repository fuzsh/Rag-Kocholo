        "text": "AMANDA SEYFRIED\n\nBorn: December 3, 1985 in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nHeight: 5’3\n\nPersonal Quotes:\n\n“At 11, I had a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio. Actually, it was not a crush. It was an obsession! I was also obsessed with Richard Dean Anderson, from MacGyver (1985) and Indiana Jones.”\n\n“It’s really easy to avoid the tabloids. You just live your life and don’t hang out with famous people who are in the tabloids. Don’t do anything controversial and be a normal person.”\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nAs you can tell by the quotes I was forced to use and the fact that the only solo movie awards / nominations to her credit are from MTV, Amanda Seyfried hasn’t yet been able to establish herself as a serious A-List talent (and I doubt her upcoming role as ‘Sam L. Jackson’ in Ted 2 is going to help her out). However, this young lady has still managed to prove herself at the box office, being part of some terrific ensemble casts (Mean Girls, Mamma Mia, Les Miserables) and also helping other films succeed despite poor reviews (Dear John, Red Riding Hood…Ted 2?).\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nBest Known For: Mamma Mia (‘Sophie’), Big Love (‘Sarah Henrickson’) and Les Miserables (‘Cosette’)\n\nBreakout Role (according to the masses): Mamma Mia\n\nBreakout Role (according to Leo Craven): Jennifer’s Body\n\n– I never watched Mamma Mia, but I was sold on Seyfried’s role as ‘Needy’ in the underrated horror film Jennifer’s Body…unfortunately, this lead me to watching her role as ‘Valerie’ in the Twilight-wanna-be Red Riding Hood…avoid at all costs!\n\nBox Office Status: Lucky Charm\n\nNext Project to Look Out for: Ted 2 (In theaters June 26th)\n\nMost Famous Role (Sophie in Mamma Mia: “Lay All Your Love On Me” scene):\n\nAWARDS:\n\nNominated for Best Female Performance (MTV Movie Awards) in 2010 for “Dear John”\n\nNominated for Breakthrough Performance by a Female (MTV Movie Awards) in 2009 for “Mamma Mia”\n\nONE LAST THING:\n\nIf you haven’t watched “Jennifer’s Body” I recommend checking out the preview below, and consider renting on-demand or at your local ‘throwback’ video store (we actually have one in our neighborhood). It’s not a great horror film, but it is highly entertaining (‘yes’, Megan Fox is in it too):"
