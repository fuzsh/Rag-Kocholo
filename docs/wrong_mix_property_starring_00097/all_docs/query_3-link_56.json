        "text": "Lehigh Valley-native Amanda Seyfried is once again up for gold, and things could turn out better this time.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, Seyfried netted her first Oscar nomination for Netflix’s 2020 film “Mank,” but now, she’s picked up a nomination for her work on the small screen. Seyfried is up for the “Best Actress in a Limited Series” Emmy for her portrayal of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in the Hulu miniseries “The Dropout.” The show as a whole is nominated for “Best Limited or Anthology Series,” technically giving Seyfried a second nom, as she’s credited as a producer on the series.\n\nThe Emmys air at 8 p.m. on Monday on NBC and streaming live on Peacock.\n\nSeyfried, a William Allen High School graduate, is up against tough competition in the category. Also nominated for “Best Actress in a Limited Series” are Toni Collette in “The Staircase,” Julia Garner in “Inventing Anna,” Lily James in “Pam & Tommy,” Sarah Paulson in “Impeachment: American Crime Story” and Margaret Qualley in “Maid.” Notably, every nominated role in this category is, or is based on, a real person.\n\n“The Dropout” traced Holmes’ rise and fall as the founder and CEO of Theranos, a revolutionary blood-testing company that, following a 2015 “Wall Street Journal” exposé, was found to have deceived investors and was laden with fraudulence.\n\nSeyfried’s turn as the wide-eyed, deep-voiced Holmes, who was convicted in January of this year on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, was deeply unsettling in the best way.\n\nOne clip from the show went wildly viral online, depicting Seyfried-as-Holmes, in an oversized puffer vest with green juice in hand, dancing in an awkwardly seductive way towards Theranos’ COO and Holmes’ romantic partner, Sunny Balwani (played by Naveen Andrews) while lip-syncing rapper Lil Wayne’s 2011 hit “How To Love.” You’ll cringe hard, but that’s why it’s great acting.\n\nIn 2021, after critics effusively praised Seyfried’s performance as early Hollywood starlet Marion Davies, she fell short of the Oscar win. This time around, things could be different. GoldDerby, the preeminent entertainment awards betting odds website, has Seyfried’s current odds to win at 69/20, far ahead of Lily James, who has the next-best odds at 9/2.\n\nWith the Emmys just on the other side of the weekend, entertainment publications have been publishing their experts’ predictions ahead of the awards ceremony, and Seyfried seems to be pulling ahead of the pack. Here’s what they have to say:\n\nLiz Shannon Miller, “Consequence” — Predicted winner: Amanda Seyfried, “The Dropout.” “Another great collection of actors (albeit a very white one), but Seyfried has a lot of different factors working to her advantage here — the level of transformation involved, not to mention that much-discussed dancing scene.”\n\nPete Hammond, “Deadline” — Predicted winner: Amanda Seyfried, “The Dropout.” “(Holmes) will be sentenced in September and could receive up to 20 years in prison right around the same time that, if my prediction is correct, Seyfried will be collecting her first Emmy.”\n\nKristen Baldwin and Darren Franich, “Entertainment Weekly” — “This award belongs to Margaret Qualley...But Amanda Seyfried is the bigger star, and she did a solid impression of the Elizabeth Holmes’ static-y baritone, so… congrats!”\n\nAdrian Horton, “The Guardian” — Will win: Amanda Seyfried. Should win: Amanda Seyfried. “The task of turning Elizabeth Holmes into a legible yet unsympathetic antihero was monumental, and she delivered, faux baritone and all.”\n\nDaniel Fienberg and Scott Feinberg, “The Hollywood Reporter” — Will win: Amanda Seyfried, “The Dropout.” Should win: Margaret Qualley, “Maid.” “Any of them could take it, but Seyfried, for her first major TV project since becoming a movie star, probably has a slight edge.”\n\nGlenn Whipp, “The Los Angeles Times” — Winner: Seyfried. Possible Upset: James. “Before the nominations, I thought Seyfried had this in the bag. But ‘Pam & Tommy’ earned more nominations than ‘The Dropout’ — though none for writing and directing — and now I’m not so sure.”\n\nAlan Sepinwall, “Rolling Stone” — “Seyfried was by far the most successful of this spring’s “movie stars play infamous people in a prestige miniseries” entrants, and it feels like the Academy will want to reward her for getting it right.”\n\nKatey Rich, “Vanity Fair” — Predicted winner: Amanda Seyfried, “The Dropout.” Could win: Julia Garner, “Inventing Anna.” Should win: Amanda Seyfriend, “The Dropout.” “From the moment we heard the voice, we knew Amanda Seyfried would be the one to beat in this category, for a portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes that got all the obvious things right—the messy hair, the messiah complex—but also showed a deeper empathy for how one person could cause so much exceptional damage.”\n\nJen Chaney, “Vulture” — Will win: Amanda Seyfried. Should win: Amanda Seyfried. “Seyfried elevates what could have easily been a wink-wink satirical portrayal of Elizabeth Holmes into something much richer and sobering to witness.”\n\nBrendan Morrow, “The Week” — Will win: Amanda Seyfriend, “The Dropout.” Might win: Lily James, “Pam & Tommy.” “It’s one the best performances of (Seyfried’s) career to date, and the entire series is built around it.”\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
