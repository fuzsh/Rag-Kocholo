They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nAmanda Seyfried is an American actress who has received numerous accolades throughout her career.\n\nSeyfried came to prominence following her feature film debut in the teen comedy Mean Girls (2004),[1] for which she received an MTV Movie & TV Award. She then appeared in the romantic comedy films Dear John and Letters to Juliet (both 2010), earning various nominations at the Teen Choice Awards, and the black comedy horror Jennifer's Body (2009), which won her a second MTV Movie & TV Award. She starred in the ABBA-inspired musicals Mamma Mia! (2008) and its sequel Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018),[2] for which she was nominated for two People's Choice Awards, and the period musical Les Misérables (2012), which earned her a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nSeyfried received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Marion Davies in David Fincher's biopic Mank (2020),[3] earning nominations in the Best Supporting Actress category at the Academy Awards, AACTA International Awards, Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and Golden Globe Awards. This acclaim continued for her starring role as Elizabeth Holmes in the drama miniseries The Dropout (2022),[4] for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film.\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref. 2021 Best Supporting Actress Mank Nominated [5]\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref. 2021 Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture Mank Nominated [6] 2023 Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film The Dropout Nominated[a] [7] Best Actress – Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film Won\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref. 2022 Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series The Dropout Nominated[a] [8] Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie Won\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref. 2023 Outstanding Producer of Limited or Anthology Series Television The Dropout Won[a] [9]\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref. 2013 Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture Les Misérables Nominated[b] [10] 2023 Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series The Dropout Nominated [11]\n\nYear Category Work Result Ref.
