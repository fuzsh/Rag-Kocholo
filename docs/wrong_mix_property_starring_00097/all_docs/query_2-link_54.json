        "text": "Craig Conover’s eight-figure lifestyle brand just received a pretty “fetch” cosign.\n\nOn Friday, July 12, the Southern Charm cast member opened his Sewing Down South-Charleston store to award-winning actress Amanda Seyfried. According to Post and Courier, the Mean Girls and Mamma Mia! star was at the flagship to host a private pop-up event for Make It Cute — her sustainable children’s company that specializes in playhouses and cottages.\n\nAmanda Seyfried gives a shoutout to Craig Conver's Sewing Down South\n\nAmanda’s Sewing Down South visit was documented in a series of Instagrams, which showed Craig posing with the Emmy winner alongside his fellow Bravolebs Rodrigo Reyes and Jennifer Snowden.\n\nAmanda also shared several glimpses at the exclusive event, which she led alongside her Make It Cute business partners/childhood friends, Anne Hoehn and Maureen North.\n\n“Thanks for having us [Sewing Down South]!” Amanda captioned a Story.\n\nHere's what you might have missed on Bravo:\n\nCraig Conover and Austen Kroll Provide a Taste of Their New Charleston Restaurant\n\nGet a New Look Inside Craig Conover's Charleston Home\n\nAll About Paige DeSorbo's Boyfriends and Hookups From Craig Conover To Carl Radke\n\nCraig Conover opens a Sewing Down South store in Nashville\n\nThe visit took place about a month after Sewing Down South reached another exciting milestone. On June 15, Craig and his team officially launched Sewing Down South-Nashville, marking the brand’s first brick-and-mortar outside of Charleston. The two-day grand opening reportedly drew hundreds of visitors who were treated to a meet-and-greet, beverages, and exclusive merch.\n\nCraig spoke about the opening in an interview with The Tennessean last month, explaining why the Music City was such a good fit for his brand.\n\n“This has been a goal of mine since we opened the Charleston store,” he said. “I love Nashville. I feel like it’s a sister city to Charleston, and I respect the city. I knew that if we had a second location one day, it would be here.”\n\nCraig’s Sewing Down South co-founder Amanda Latifi echoed the reasoning.\n\n“If you’re traveling to the South or you want to get a feel of it, a lot of times you might be picking between Nashville and Charleston, so why don’t we just meet people where they are?” she said. “It just felt like the foundation was laid out for us. It was really a matter of finding the right spot.”\n\nCraig says opening a business \"was the best thing [he] ever did\"\n\nThe Southern Charm-er launched Sewing Down South in 2018 after he took up a sewing hobby. He initially focused on decorative pillows but has since expanded into kitchen and dining goods, pet accessories, scented candles, branded apparel, and more. Although the company has proven to be quite lucrative, Craig admitted he had doubts about its success.\n\n“I grew up watching Shark Tank, and I was like, ‘I don’t know if I’m supposed to do that,’” he said. “But my dad said, ‘Do you want all of what’s turned into nothing after a year or a good piece of something that might really grow?’… It was the best thing I ever did.”"
