        "text": "A Walmart ad touting its Black Friday deals gathered three of the four stars of Mean Girls, with the movies’ Amanda Seyfried, Lindsay Lohan and Lacey Chabert diving into their iconic characters.\n\nThe spot, which dropped today, featured the trio as adult versions of the high schoolers they played in the 2004 movie directed by Mark Waters and written by Tina Fey.\n\nIn the spot, Chabert’s Gretchen is still trying to make “Fetch” happen except this time as a mom of a high schooler (spoiler: they’re still not buying it), while Seyfried’s Karen Smith is a news reporter still trying to nail down the facts. Lohan’s Cady, who narrates the ad like she did in the movie, is now a high school guidance counselor.\n\nNo sign of Rachel McAdams, who played the mean girls’ leader Regina in the movie, in the ad, which runs about 2 minutes.\n\nThe movie earned Fey a WGA Award nom for adapting Rosiland Wiseman’s nonfiction book Queen Bees and Wannabees: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and the New Realities of Girl World.\n\nThe IP was later turned into a musical that debuted on Broadway in 2018. It scored 12 Tony nominations and ran for more than 800 performances, and now has a national tour.\n\nWatch the Walmart ad above."
