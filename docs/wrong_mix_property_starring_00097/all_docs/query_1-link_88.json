        "text": "It was one of the iconic teen movies of the 2000s giving us so many classic lines for the pop-cultural lexicon. On Wednesdays we wear pink. And you can't sit with us.\n\nBut that aside, Mean Girls starred an host of talented actresses who have since gone on to have amazing careers: the already pretty famous Lindsey Lohan (who played Cady Heron), Rachel McAdams (who played the insufferable Regina George), Lacey Chabert (who played the spineless Gretchen Weaner) and of course Amanda Seyfried who played the character Karen, known for... well, let's just say she was known for not being the sharpest eyebrow pencil in the make-up bag.\n\nSpeaking to Marie Claire in a recent interview, actress Amanda Seyfried says the fame she experienced because of Mean Girls gave her pause for thought on how it must feel to be famous even younger than 18 (the age she was at the time): “I think being really famous [young] must really f**king suck,” she says. \"It must make you feel completely unsafe in the world. I see these younger actors who think they have to have security. They think they have to have an assistant. They think their whole world has changed. It can get stressful. I’ve seen it happen to my peers. So, I bought a farm. I was like, let’s go in the opposite way.”\n\nRead more:Viewers 'complain' as GMB accused of 'spoiling' Who Dares Win result\n\nThe actress maintains that not a day goes by when she doesn't get recognised for being in the movie. But says when the film came out, she didn't always enjoy the interactions that came with being recognised saying it was mostly boys asking her if she could predict the weather with her breasts. Amanda says: “I always felt really grossed out by that,” she says. “I was like 18 years old. It was just gross.”\n\nShe's referring, of course, to one of the classic lines from the film where Karen says: \"It's like I have ESPN or something. My breasts can always tell when it's going to rain. Well… they can tell when it's raining.\"\n\nAmanda has won praise for her most recent TV role in which she plays Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of failed Silicon Valley company Theranos in The Dropout, and even manages to nail the character's deep voice and infrequent blinking. Speaking to Marie Claire, the show's creator Liz Meriweather said: “Amanda’s casting saved the project in this amazing way. She’s just one of those few actresses that I’ve always known could do comedy and drama. She’d done a ton of work before we even got to the first rehearsals. At the first rehearsal, she had that voice; she had those mannerisms.”"
