        "text": "Background\n\nAmanda Michelle Seyfried was born on December 3, 1985, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to Ann and Jack Seyfried. Her mother worked as an occupational therapist, while her father was a pharmacist. Her sole sibling is Jennifer, her older sister. Her alma mater was William Allen High School. She began modeling at the age of 11 and missed school as a result of her modeling and acting commitments. Even with her hectic schedule, she managed to graduate from high school in 2003.\n\nSeyfried’s first acting job was as Lucinda Marie (Lucy) Montgomery in the serial opera “As the World Turns” when she was 15 years old. From 2006 to 2011, she starred as Sarah Henrickson in the H.B.O. drama series “Big Love.” She also started working for The Limited Too, a clothing company. Seyfried gave up modeling to pursue a career as an actor. After a few minor roles in various T.V. shows, she was hired as Karen Smith, a dim-witted teen in the teen film “Mean Girls” (2004). As a result of the film’s box office success, her fame soared. She went on to appear in films like “Nine Lives” and “American Gun.” In 2006, she appeared in five episodes of the T.V. show “Wildfire.” Sophie in the film “Mamma Mia!” was one of her most memorable parts. In “Jennifer’s Body,” she played one of the main leads, Anita. She is a talented singer who has contributed to the soundtracks of numerous films, notably “Mamma Mia!” which scored $395 million at the box office. In 2011, she appeared in the film “In Time” as Sylvia Weis. In 2013, she starred in the films “The Big Wedding” and “Lovelace.” Seyfried was part of an ensemble cast in the western comedy movie “A Million Ways to Die in the West.” She worked with Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane in the 2015 comedy “Ted 2,” in which she plays a marijuana-addicted lawyer Samantha Jackson. Despite being critically panned, the film was a huge financial success, grossing more than $216 million at the box office. She was a part of the comedy-drama “The Art of Racing in the Rain” in 2019.\n\nSeyfried then acted in the horror film “You Should Have Left.” In 2020, she starred in the biographical film “Mank,” for which she received critical acclaim and nominations for both a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. She was rumored to be dating actor James Franco.\n\nShe was romantically involved with actor Justin Long from 2013 to 2015. After splitting up with Long in early 2016, she began dating actor Thomas Sadoski. When the couple got engaged in September 2016, Seyfried was expecting, and the pair married in a private ceremony in March 2017. Seyfried and Sadoski have two children together."
