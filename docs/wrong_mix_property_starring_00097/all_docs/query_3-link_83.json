        "text": "Last night's Critics Choice Awards saw Amanda Seyfried once again looking back to the days of Old Hollywood. “If this look was a cocktail, it would be one part Greta Garbo in Berlin with two parts Liza Minnelli in Cabaret and add a dash of Charlie Chaplin,” stylist Elizabeth Stewart told British Vogue of Seyfried's sparkling, tuxedo-style Miu Miu get-up. Looking every inch a movie star, Seyfried, who received a nomination for her turn as starlet Marion Davies in Mank, wore a show-stopping beauty look that hinged on a sculptural pin-curled updo, soft smoky eyes, and a bold crimson lip.\n\n\"We wanted the makeup to be strong and beautiful with a hint of playfulness,\" said makeup artist Genevieve Herr, who helped Seyfried get ready ahead of joining the ceremony's virtual telecast from Savannah, Georgia. Winking at Minnelli's character Sally Bowles in Cabaret, Herr perfected Seyfried's natural glow with Lancôme Teint Miracle Radiant Foundation, blended Seyfried's lids with sooty and silver shades from the Hypnôse 5-Color eyeshadow palette in Smokey Chic, and punctuated her pout by lining it with a blue-toned red lip pencil and layering L’Absolu Rouge Intimatte in Rose Lancôme over it for a \"dash of pink.\" Here, a behind-the-scenes peek at Seyfried's getting-ready session."
