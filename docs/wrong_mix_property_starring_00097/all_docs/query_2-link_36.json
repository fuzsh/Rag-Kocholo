She held minor roles in multiple TV dramas and received vocal training in her teen years, later making her film debut in 2004â€™s Mean Girls as Karen Smith. Seyfriedâ€™s career continued to take off after she starred on HBOâ€™s series Big Love (2006). She landed a lead role alongside Meryl Streep in the 2008 musical film Mamma Mia! and returned for the sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, 10 years later. Seyfried earned her first Academy Award nomination for playing Cosette in Les Miserables (2012), won a Golden Globe as Marion Davies in Mank (2020) and took home a Primetime Emmy for her performance in the series The Dropout (2022). She also starred in Boogie Woogie (2009), Dear John (2010), Chloe (2019) and Letters to Juliet (2010). In 2015, Seyfried met now-husband Thomas Sadoski while working together on the Off-Broadway production The Way We Get By. At the time, Seyfried was dating Justin Long and Sadoski was married to Kimberly Hope. Following their respective breakups, Seyfried and Sadoski costarred in The Last Word (2016) and sparked a romance off camera. They tied the knot in 2017 and share two children: daughter Nina and son Thomas. Seyfried is a board member of the nonprofit organization INARA and also works closely with War Child to support and aid children wounded in war zones.",
