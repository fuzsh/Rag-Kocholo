        "text": "Amanda Seyfried began her career as a child model before venturing into acting in her mid-teens. She appeared on the CBS show ‘As The World Turns’ and ABC’s ‘All My Children’ before making her film debut in the highly successful teen comedy ‘Mean Girls’. During the 2000s, Seyfried followed up her role in ‘Mean Girls’ with a series of films spanning romantic comedies to erotic thrillers. She notably starred in ‘Mamma Mia!’ in 2008, ‘Jennifer’s Body’ alongside Megan Fox in 2009, and ‘Chloe’ that same year.\n\nSeyfried also bagged starring roles in ‘Letters to Juliet’ and ‘Dear John’ before appearing in the epic musical ‘Les Miserables’. In the 2010s, the actor continued her success by starring in ‘Lovelace’ alongside Adrien Brody and Sharon Stone, Seth McFarlane’s ‘A Million Ways to Die in the West’, and Paul Schrader’s ‘First Reformed’ with Ethan Hawke. Seyfried starred in several episodes of David Lynch’s ‘Twin Peaks: The Return’ in 2017.\n\nDemonstrating an ability for both light-hearted and dramatic roles, Seyfried has continually evolved with every role. With that, the actor recieved her first nod from the Academy when she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress after her portrayal of Marion Davies in David Fincher’s ‘Mank’. She has also won multiple MTV Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and several Satellite Awards.\n\nMore recently, Seyfriend portrayed disgraced entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes in ‘The Dropout’, for which she recieved much critical acclaim. She also voiced Daphne in the animated movie ‘Scoob!’ and reprised her role in ‘Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’."
