For the remainder of the war, the Division saw action on the Western Front, taking part in all of the major campaigns & seeing severe fighting. It was demobilised in May 1919.

World War II[]

At the outbreak of war in September 1939, the division was mobilised as motorised infantry under the title of the 1st London Division. It was reorganised as an infantry division in June 1940 and redesignated as the 56th (London) Infantry Division on 18 November 1940. The divisional insignia during the Second World War was changed to an outline of a black cat in a red background. The cat stood for Dick Whittington's cat, a symbol of London.

The division remained in the United Kingdom during the Battle of France, moving to the Middle East in November 1942, where it served in Iraq and Palestine until moving to Egypt in March 1943 and thence forward to Libya, and the front, in April. This involved the division travelling some 2,300 miles by road, a notable achievement and testament to the organization of the division and the ability of its mechanics and technicians. The division sat out the Allied invasion of Sicily (except for the 168th Brigade, which was attached to the understrength 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and moved to Italy in September 1943 and saw service in the Battle of Monte Cassino, in January, serving there until March 1944 and participated in the Anzio Campaign. After being withdrawn to Egypt at the end of March, the division returned to Italy in July 1944, where it took part in the Battles along the Gothic Line and remained there until after VE Day.

After crossing the Volturno in October 1943, the division entered the town of Calvi Vecchia. Their attempts to radio the United States Fifth Army to cancel a planned bombing on the town failed. As a last resort, the 56th released an American homing pigeon named G.I. Joe, which carried a message that reached the allies just as the planes were being warmed up. The attack was called off and the town was saved from the planned air assault.[1][2]

Post War[]

In 1946, the 56th Division was demobilised then re-constituted as the 56th (London) Armoured Division, T.A. The new formation included the 22nd Armoured Brigade and the 168th Lorried Infantry Brigade, with the Inns of Court and City Yeomanry acting as the Division's reconnaissance unit.

On 20 December 1955, the Secretary of State for War informed the House of Commons that the armoured divisions and the 'mixed' division were to be converted to infantry.[4] The 56th Division was one of the eight divisions placed on a lower establishment for home defence only.[5] The territorial units of the Royal Armoured Corps were also reduced in number to nine armoured regiments and eleven reconnaissance regiments. This was effected by the amalgamation of pairs of regiments, and the conversion of four RAC units to an infantry role.

On 20 July 1960, a further reduction of the TA was announced in the House of Commons. The Territorials were to be reduced from 266 fighting units to 195. The reductions were carried out in 1961, mainly by the amalgamation of units. On 1 May 1961, the TA divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts and matched with Civil Defence Regions to aid the mobilisation for war.[6] Thus the division ceased to exist as an independent entity, and was linked to London District.

The 4th Battalion, Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment was formed in 1961 by the amalgamation of the 6th Bn., East Surrey Regiment and the 23rd London Regiment, with a Battalion HQ and HQ Company at Kingston upon Thames.[7] It formed part of 47th (London) Infantry Brigade (56th London Division/District).

An echo of the Division emerged again from 1987 to 1993, when the public duties battalions in the London District were grouped as the 56th Infantry Brigade.
