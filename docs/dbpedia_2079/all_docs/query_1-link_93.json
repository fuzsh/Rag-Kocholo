        "text": "In the battle for Italy during the Second World War, Monte Cassino was not just a key strategic outpost for the Axis powers on the road to Rome â it was one of the strongest defensive positions in Europe.\n\nAmong the huge Allied coalition facing a gruelling uphill struggle to conquer this rugged mountain and its formidable defences, it was the Polish II Corps who finally broke the Axis line.\n\nAmid the monastery ruins, after five months of heavy fighting, slow progress and strategic blunders, these brave soldiers proudly raised the red and white flag of Poland.\n\nBut Monte Cassino was just one chapter in an extraordinary tale of occupation, exile and fightback.\n\nThis is their story.\n\nThe Polish II Corps formed in 1943, the same year as Operation Avalanche and just a year or so before the battles at Monte Cassino.\n\nBy 1945, they comprised approximately 55,000 men and 1,500 women, incorporating units such as:\n\n3rd Carpathian Infantry Division\n\n5th Kresowa Infantry Division\n\n2nd Armoured Brigade\n\nArmy Group Artillery\n\nWomenâs Auxiliary Service\n\nIf you were to read a list of Polish soldiers at Monte Cassino, you would find troops from many different walks of life, and an array of religious backgrounds â Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish.\n\nToday, the resting place of many can be found at the Monte Cassino Polish war cemetery, along with the ashes and gravestone of their general, WÅadysÅaw Anders.\n\nThe II Corps travelled a long, dangerous route from Poland to Monte Cassino â enduring the brutal Soviet Gulag and an arduous evacuation to the Middle East before they even arrived at the battlefield in Italy.\n\nThis saga ties closely to the history of their homeland, and its status in Europe at the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\nâFor our freedom and yoursâ â Poland 1918-1939\n\nPoland is set on the flat expanses of the North European plain â a historical crossing point for armies marching from east to west, and west to east, with few defensible borders.\n\nAs a result, the nation has often found itself at the mercy of powerful, expansionist neighbours. In fact, from 1795 to 1918, Poland didnât exist at all. Instead, it was partitioned by the Austro-Hungarian, German and Russian Empires.\n\nPolish self-determination and political consciousness were key weapons against their authoritarian rulers. During this period, âfor our freedom and yoursâ became a call to arms for Polish soldiers and exiles, as they fought in revolutionary uprisings at home and abroad.\n\nFreedom was a watchword in Poland for many decades to come. According to Matthew Parker, author of Monte Cassino: The Hardest Fought Battle of World War II, by the time of the Second World War, there had been âgenerations of Poles wanting to free their countryâ¦ a huge tradition.â\n\nAfter the First World War, when the map of Europe was redrawn, Poland reformed as a republic â seeming to beckon a new era of self-governance for the Polish people.\n\nBut in early 1919, just months after the conflict came to an end, Soviet troops invaded â hoping to use Poland as a jumping-off point to spread their revolution to Germany and Western Europe.\n\nThough the Poles repelled the invading Russian forces, this moment would be a foreboding sign of things to come, as well as a dark reminder of the past.\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the beginning of World War Two\n\nPoland was invaded again on September 1st, 1939, this time infamously by Nazi Germany â seeking lebensraum territorial expansion. As a result, the UK and France declared war on Germany, and the Second World War had begun.\n\nA few weeks later, the Soviet Union also invaded from the east. Despite being ideological enemies, the German regime and the Soviets had agreed to carve up Poland and Eastern Europe between them as part of a secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop nonaggression pact.\n\nThe people of Poland suffered brutal treatment at the hands of both regimes. In German-occupied territory, the Poles were considered untermenshen and were heavily persecuted.\n\nThe Nazis also began the systematic subjugation and extermination of millions of Polish Jews. By 1941, some of the most notorious concentration camps of the Holocaust had been built on Polish soil â including Auschwitz and Treblinka. Over the next few years, an estimated two million people were murdered in those two camps alone, while Warsaw became the site of Europeâs most notorious Jewish ghetto.\n\nMeanwhile, eastern Poland was incorporated into the Soviet territories of Ukraine and Belarus. There, the feared NKVD secret police carried out the deportation and massacre of Polish army officers, civil servants and professionals in the forest of Katyn.\n\nOthers were rounded up and sent by rail to the Gulag in the far reaches of the vast Soviet empire â from Kazakhstan to Siberia â where they faced starvation, disease and brutal forced labour.\n\nIn one Siberian camp, 40% of the prisoners were said to have died in the first year.\n\nFor many Poles, their treatment led to lasting trauma â and vigilance. Matthew Parker notes how some survivors of World War Two were left with permanent fear of a further Russian invasion.\n\nHowever, along with this trauma, there was also a deep-rooted desire among many Poles to fight back.\n\nWÅadysÅaw Anders forms a new Polish Army\n\nIn 1941, the surprise German invasion of the Soviet Union â codenamed Operation Barbarossa â put a swift end to the fragile German-Soviet alliance. Now allied with the United Kingdom, Stalin agreed to release his Polish detainees and allow them to form their own army on Soviet soil.\n\nGeneral WÅadysÅaw Anders was released from the NKVDâs feared Lubiyanka jail to lead the new force. Anders had fallen foul of the Soviet regime for fighting for Tsarist forces in World War One, and battling the Red Army in the Polish-Soviet conflict. He had faced years of interrogation, starvation, solitary confinement and torture.\n\nBut now, the resolute Anders called on \"all able-bodied Polish citizens to fulfil their duty to their country and to join the banner of the White Eagleâ.\n\nâOne might ask what our soldiers, scattered all over the world, are fighting for. There is only one, simple and clear answer: we fight for justice and for our nation, we fight for free and independent Poland, which every nerve in our body is craving so badly. We know that great hardships await us, that the way will be tough and bloody, and that perhaps not all of us will succeed. But weâll get there eventually â so help us God!\"\n\nFrom a radio speech in 1941\n\nThe Polish Army heads south\n\nThe troops and civilians who eventually answered Andersâ call were exhausted, malnourished and often extremely ill. They had faced 18 months in forced labour camps, building roads and railways, or working in mines and sawmills.\n\nThey gathered in the steppe of Kazakhstan, where they lived in tents in freezing conditions. Before long, however, it was time to journey south to the British territories of Iraq, and Iran â known then as Persia.\n\nOf the 1.7 million soldiers and civilians who were taken to the USSR, only around 115,000 made the long journey south between March and October 1942. According to one account:\n\nâMany thousands died of malnutrition, exhaustion, and diseases (typhoid was rampant), often on the doorstep to freedom, waiting to be transported to Persiaâ.\n\nParker notes the âsense of extreme joyâ of the Poles to leave the USSR, contrasted with their physical condition when they arrived in the Middle East:\n\nâTheyâre met by the British, and all of their clothes are instantly burnt because they're all full of lice. They're instantly given very urgent medical treatments and food. And some of them actually made themselves very ill, almost fatally ill, by eating too much too soon because they have been so starved for so long.â\n\nThose troops that made the journey were incorporated into the British Eighth Army, entering a steady training process to get them back to full strength. They then formed the Polish II Corps â numbering around 40,000 â before being posted to Persia, Iraq and Palestine, ultimately heading to Egypt and then on to the Italian campaign.\n\nOver the last few years, the Axis war machine had mercilessly torn through Europe and Africa. But the tide was turning.\n\nIn Egypt, the British Eighth Army defeated Erwin Rommelâs forces at El Alamein, while the Soviets had taken the upper hand at Stalingrad. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, the Americans were shortly to join the fray as well.\n\nAnders and his troops had witnessed the terror of invasion, the fear of occupation and the hell of the Gulag. They saw themselves as âall that was left of free Polandâ. With Hitler and Mussolini on the back foot, they now had a chance to fight through Axis territory to recapture and rebuild their homeland.\n\nHitlerâs soft underbelly?\n\nIn 1943, the Polish Corps landed in Taranto and joined a large Allied force taking on the Axis in Italy.\n\nItaly was said to be âHitlerâs soft underbellyâ, but breaking the rigorous defences on the road to Rome proved harder than expected.\n\nThe Gustav Line was a series of heavy fortifications that ran the width of the Italian peninsula. It made excellent use of the peaks, gorges and caves of the Apennine mountains, and was reinforced with machine gun turrets, barbed wire and mines. The area was âicy in the winter and baking in summerâ.\n\nMonte Cassino and its seemingly impossible obstacles formed the linchpin of the Gustav Line. If the Allies took this, the rest would crumble.\n\nBut it wouldnât be easy.\n\nThe Germans constructed cunning defences on the slopes and took up commanding positions on the higher ground.\n\nAtop the towering hill was a vast, ancient Benedictine monastery. Though this abbey was said to be a neutral zone, the Allies believed the enemy to be using it as a surveillance position from which they could direct attacks and artillery fire. At the bottom of the mountain, meanwhile, the Allies faced a quagmire of flooded rivers and brutal winter conditions.\n\nEvery move the Allied troops made seemed to be watched. The monastery took on an ominous, malevolent presence of its own: âYou couldnât scratch without being seenâ, said one soldier. âAnd it was a psychological thing. It grew the longer you were thereâ.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to take the position, British commanders demanded action to remove this obstacle. They directed waves of US bombs to flatten the monastery, despite dubious evidence of its occupation.\n\nThe bombings devastated the complex and killed 230 civilians. But while the cloisters, courtyards and statues were reduced to rubble and craters, the German forces, who indeed had not been using the monastery, quickly moved in and established defensive positions in the ruins.\n\nSubsequent Allied engagements achieved little progress and suffered heavy casualties.\n\nIt was at this moment, with the Allies in disarray, that the II Corps were assigned the task of taking the hill once and for all.\n\nIf they were successful, it would not only achieve the seemingly impossible â the morale boost and propaganda victory for the previously-oppressed Polish units would be incalculable.\n\nPolandâs army at Monte Cassino\n\nOn 12th May 1944, the Polish II Corps advanced on Monte Cassino, with Anders eyeing a relatively gradual assault on the monastery. Rather than heading straight towards the target and risking enemy fire, his troops would steadily take positions on the high ground beyond the ruins.\n\nThe Polish Corps were hungry for the fight. According to Matthew Parker, as they ascended the hillside, one British eyewitness noted how heâd ânever seen anyone so full of hatred. All they wanted to do is kill Germansâ.\n\nAs they marched, they were subject to propaganda through loudspeakers â urging them to surrender, join forces with Germany and take the fight to the Russians.\n\nIt is safe to say this did not work.\n\nOn their way to their attacking positions at Monte Cassino, the Polish troops noted the stark ruin of this once idyllic Italian hillside â the product of months of grinding battle.\n\nA bloody advance\n\nThey immediately found that the artillery fire had been ineffective, despite its scale. The ruins, craters, caves and other defences had provided excellent shelter for the German troops. If they were to vanquish their enemy, the Polish Corps would need to face them up close and personal.\n\nUnder heavy fire, the Carpathian Battalion succeeded in making progress onto Hill 593 despite mounting casualties. A German counterattack came, covered by mortar and machine gun, but the Poles defended their position with fierce determination. Eventually, they were forced to retreat â and only a few dozen evaded death or injury.\n\nMeanwhile, the fight for Phantom Ridge became an intense battle of attrition. The commanding German position made for slow progress â with Polish troops regularly needing to dive for cover and crawl.\n\nUltimately, enemy fire proved insurmountable for the Polish Corps and they were forced to withdraw. However, this push had provided an opportunity for other Allied attacks to make headway. The Free French Units were now making progress on the far side of the battle, while British divisions were soon to enter the field as well.\n\nDespite their heavy losses, the symbolic victory and morale boost for the Polish people was immeasurable.\n\nThe bravery of the Polish II Corps made global headlines in its aftermath. Monte Cassino graffiti was even found scrawled on walls across Poland as a mark of defiance against their Nazi occupiers â as âMonte Cassinoâ became a byword for Polish courage.\n\nWith Germanyâs defences all but broken, the Allies soon liberated Rome â albeit controversially. Hoping to lead the first Allied army into the Italian capital, American General Mark Clark missed a vital opportunity to cut off the entire German 10th Army, who regrouped and fought the Allies again at the Gothic Line, north of Florence.\n\nThough the fight for Italy would wear on for many more months, the noose would soon tighten fully around the Axis. The D-Day landings would open a new front of the war, while Soviet troops pushed in from the east.\n\nAs the Allies liberated German-occupied territory, discovered the atrocities of the Holocaust and entered Berlin, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels would ultimately take their own lives. The war in Europe ended on 8th May 1945.\n\nHowever, for Anders and many of the Polish troops, the Allied victory was bittersweet.\n\nPoland was again under Russian influence and â despite assurances at the Yalta conference that Polandâs government in exile would have a say on its future - the post-war reality was starkly different to the wishes of Anders and many of the Poles. Indeed, many chose to settle in Great Britain in the aftermath of the war.\n\nBack in Poland, the Soviet occupation gave way to a totalitarian state, which would remain under Soviet influence until the early 1990s.\n\nDespite its turbulent post-war era, the victory at Monte Cassino remains a huge source of pride for Polish veterans and civilians alike.\n\nToday, the elaborate Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino is something of a pilgrimage site, where coachloads of Polish people sing national songs, and priests conduct services."
