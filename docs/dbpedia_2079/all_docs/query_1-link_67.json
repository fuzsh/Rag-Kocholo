        "text": "The Libyan port of Tobruk became a key strategic position for the Allies during World War Two (WW2). But in 1941, the âdesert foxâ Erwin Rommel and his Afrikakorps had it well and truly surrounded.\n\nThe only thing stopping Rommel from capturing the city was a modest garrison of Australian, British and Commonwealth troops, who defended the position bravely in caves, tunnels and trenches. These plucky âRats of Tobrukâ fought something of a David vs. Goliath struggle against their Axis adversaries for 241 days, despite having only meagre supplies, ammunition and support.\n\nThe result was one of the first tactical Allied victories of the war â and arguably a turning point in the entire conflict. This is the story of the Battle of Tobruk.\n\n1940 was a dark year for the Allies in World War II. The German war machine had torn through Western Europe as far as the English Channel, and began pummelling British cities in The Blitz.\n\nOver in North Africa, the British still controlled the Suez Canal in Egypt â an essential Allied shipping route â but the Axis were closing in.\n\nItaly declared war on Great Britain in 1940 and invaded Egypt. Dictator Benito Mussolini was keen to expand his influence, and show he was no mere junior partner to his German allies.\n\nLike Hitler, he wanted an empire of his own. In fact, his imperial pretentions were such that he aimed to recapture the African territories of Ancient Rome. Egypt would be the connecting piece of the puzzle â bridging the gap between Italian East Africa and Libya, which was already an Italian colony.\n\nAt this point, some 300,000 Italian troops were stationed in North Africa. Only a mere 36,000 British and Free French troops defended the Suez Canal, under the command of General Sir Archibald Wavell.\n\nOn paper, it should have been a walkover for the Italians. But Marshall Rodolfo Grazianiâs forces launched a botched and ineffectual invasion. They advanced only around 60 miles to the port of SÄ«dÄ« BarrÄnÄ« before stopping, awaiting engineers to construct the so-called âVictory Roadâ along the coast.\n\nOperation Compass â and the fall of Tobruk to the Allies\n\nWhile Grazianiâs forces hesitated, General Wavell received reinforcements and made the first move. A mobile armoured force led by Lieutenant-General Nugent OâConnor stormed the Italian camps, while simultaneously cutting off their retreat. In just three days, the Allies seized nearly 40,000 prisoners.\n\nOâConnorâs forces chased the remaining Italian troops out of Egypt, into Libya and onto the hump-shaped region of Cyrenaica.\n\nThere, the Allies captured Tobruk, as well as the crucial stronghold of Bardia, taking a further 75,000 prisoners. Both had been heavily fortified by the Italians.\n\nThe British troops seemed unstoppable. Next, they launched an audacious move to outflank additional Italian troops as they fled Benghazi, covering 170 miles in 33 hours as they cut across Cyrenaica. The Italians surrendered in droves, despite massively outnumbering the Allied forces in men, tanks and guns.\n\nAt the end of the offensive, the Allies had captured 130,000 Italian and Libyan prisoners in total.\n\nBut the Alliesâ next move was to be a major strategic blunder:\n\nOperation Sonnenblume\n\nBritainâs newly captured Libyan cities fell like a deck of cards. Rommel took El Agheila on March 24th and Mersa BrÃ©ga soon after. Despite orders from his high command to hold back, he then pushed further forward, and overran Benghazi by the 2nd of April.\n\nThe Allies beat a hasty, chaotic retreat back along the coast to Egypt, losing tanks and men along the way.\n\nIn an especially audacious move, Dr Lyman notes that Rommel next cut across the desert of Cyrenaica on a trail âtraditionally used only by camel herdersâ, instead of following the expected coastal route. This cut off the British forces and sent them into further disarray.\n\nThe Alliesâ immense progress in Libya was rendered worthless. By April 11th, almost all of Cyrenaica was back in Axis hands.\n\nArchibald Wavell\n\nGeneral Sir Archibald Wavell commanded the Allied forces in Egypt, as well as the East African fronts against the Italians.\n\nIt was his decision to strike first against Grazianiâs Italian forces â and he was highly successful in doing so. However, he met his match in the desert fox Erwin Rommel, whose audacious tactics sent Wavellâs forces into disarray. He was later replaced as commander in North Africa, and redeployed to the fight in southeast Asia.\n\nLeslie Morshead\n\nThe Australian commander of the forces at Tobruk, Morshead was a former schoolmaster and veteran of World War I, known for enforcing discipline. Swearing was not permitted on his watch, and his reputation for running a tight ship earned him the nickname âMing the Mercilessâ. He was nonetheless a highly respected leader.\n\nWhile the odds were against the Rats of Tobruk, Morshead would not accept defeat lying down: âThere will be no Dunkirk hereâ, he said. âIf we should have to get out, we shall fight our way out. There is to be no surrender and no retreat.â\n\nRonald Scobie\n\nLieutenant-General Robert Scobieâs 70th Infantry Division arrived in Tobruk to relieve Morsheadâs Australian divisions, and he would later take control of the besieged forces. A multi-talented individual, Scobie was also a Scottish international Rugby Union player.\n\nErwin Rommel\n\nRommel was known for his wily tactical genius and audacious offences in the desert, which sometimes defied orders.\n\nâThe OKW, the military high command, never believed Rommel could get into Egypt, his job was simply to keep the British army occupied. But Rommel wanted to get to Cairo and make a name for himselfâ.\n\n- Dr Lyman\n\nAs a hands-on commander who impressed those he came up against, Rommel won the admiration of many Allied troops and officers. His successes in North Africa would make him a celebrity.\n\nHe was, however, less well-liked by his own German and Italian forces. With Rommel, diplomatic niceties went out of the window when it came to dispatching orders to his Italian generals!\n\nHis tactics in North Africa included capturing British depots to improve his supply lines â and thatâs why he wanted Tobruk.\n\nSir Philip Neame\n\nPhilip Neame was a high-ranking British Army officer in charge of a large but undermanned region of Cyrenaica. He commanded the Australian 9th Division and the British 2nd Armoured Division, both of which were forced into a hasty retreat at the onset of Rommelâs panzers. Neame was captured and sent to a POW camp in Italy.\n\nIt is said that Neame carries the distinction of being the only person ever to be awarded a Victoria Cross and an Olympic Gold Medal â which he won in a team shooting event at the Paris 1924 games.\n\nJohn Edmondson\n\nA famed Australian soldier who won the Victoria Cross for his valour at Tobruk, Edmondson fought off two Axis troops despite wounds to the neck and stomach â saving an officerâs life in the process.\n\nTom Derrick\n\nAn icon in his native Australia, Derrick came from a humble background in farming, and showed outstanding courage on the battlefield at Tobruk.\n\nLearn more about Tom Derrickâs story.\n\nAssault and defiance\n\nOn April 10th, 1941, the Axis began their siege. Rommel outlined his objective to capture the Suez Canal, and ordered his German and Italian forces to prevent a breakout from Tobruk.\n\nBy April 12th, Italian and German units were probing the defences of the Australian forces. Rommel was also bombarding the port with German Stuka planes, and took the nearby fortress of Bardia. From there, his troops launched frequent attacks with the heavy artillery weapon known as âBardia Billâ.\n\nHeavy fighting took place in mid-April around the El-Adem Road and Ras el-Madauar. A Panzer regiment was held off by the Australian infantry as it approached an anti-tank trench. This surprised the Germans â they had mistaken the ships coming in and out of Tobruk for an evacuation effort, and expected little resistance.\n\nThis was, however, a sign of things to come. Rather than abandoning their positions, the Allies put up an impressive defence against the armed might of Rommelâs forces. Squadrons of RAF planes attacked Axis vehicles, and resupplied themselves in airfields within the perimeter.\n\nThe Germans made another attempt to breach the anti-tank ditch. The 5th Panzer Regiment lay a small bridgehead and crossed the divide, only to run into a group of British cruiser tanks. The panzers came under fire from three directions and retreated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian infantry had pinned down the Germans. Before long, every gun and aircraft in Tobruk had joined the battle, firing into the area. The German 8th Machine Gun Battalion is said to have lost about three-quarters of its troops.\n\nThe Germans retreated, but aircraft picked up the slack. The Axis flew almost 1,000 sorties over Tobruk, and were also able to destroy a crucial anti-aircraft battery.\n\nMeanwhile, Rommel personally led an attack from the west, combining armoured, motorised and infantry divisions. Nevertheless, the Australian battalions counter-attacked with great success â and captured an entire regiment.\n\nThe Germans and Italians were unable to dig into the rocky ground, which left them exposed to Allied fire. Seizing the initiative, Morshead ordered his garrison to start patrols, launch sorties and implement guerrilla attacks on the Axis troops. On 22nd April, the Australians raided a small hill held by Italian troops, taking hundreds of prisoners and destroying two guns.\n\nTaken aback by this fierce resistance, Rommel hurried more Panzer divisions from Tripoli to help.\n\nThe Battle of the Salient\n\nRommel wanted to launch a larger-scale attack on the area â but supplies from the German high command were not forthcoming. Meanwhile, the besieged Australians and British continued to build up their defences, sow minefields, and receive supplies from Alexandria by boat.\n\nThe Battle of Tobruk would not, it seem, go smoothly for Rommel.\n\nBy April 30th, the Axis were ready to mount another attack. At 20:00, they shelled Allied defensive positions to the west of Tobruk, before destroying a section of barbed wire using tanks and grappling hooks.\n\nAxis infantry and tanks rushed into the gap under dusk and darkness. British and Australian soldiers fell quickly to enemy fire, while the tanks continued to devastate defensive positions. The advance continued.\n\nBy daybreak on May 1st, Axis tanks and infantry continued to capture key defensive positions, including the crucial high ground in the area. It is believed that the Australian and British troops lost half their strength due to casualty or capture.\n\nGerman forces advanced three kilometres, before a minefield bogged them down.\n\nOn the 3rd of May, the Australians launched a counterattack with reserve troops of the 18th Brigade. They captured just one post, but the Italian and German troops could no longer advance. Rommel called off the attack and retreated.\n\nBy this point, one of Rommelâs key weaknesses began to emerge. Dr Lyman puts the logistics of his challenge into perspective.\n\nâBy the time [Rommel] got to Tobruk, his lines of communications stretched about 1,000 or so milesâ¦ itâs a similar distance from London to Krakow. He was having to double that to get into Egypt, which was an impossible task.\n\nâAs a rule of thumb, for every soldier in a front-line battle, you need about ten behind to run the lines of communication. And of course, his resupply line from Italy down to Tripoli by ship across the Mediterranean was regularly being intercepted by Allied submarines.â\n\nRommel and his deputy, Major-General Friedrich Paulus, reported to high command that Libyan-Italian sea communications should be reinforced, and that the army needed ammunition, fuel and food before the dispatch of more vehicles and men.\n\nIndeed, the lack of progress at Tobruk made Rommel change tack.\n\nâHe then switches to mainly air attack and artillery attack,â notes Dr Lyman, âtrying to starve the defenders out.\n\nâThis was the moment when the Germans and Afrikakorps went off to fight in Egypt and the Italians were left to build a siege around Tobruk. The nature of the siege then changed. It ushered in an era where the Allies were besieged by artillery and aircraft. So, the period from May to November was basically one big air attack.â\n\nMeanwhile, the defenders of Tobruk settled into a battle routine of short, sharp offensives to regain their lost ground â such as the famous âTwin Pimples raidâ, launched by Allied commandos against Italian forces.\n\nLife under siege\n\nThe Rats of Tobruk fought not only against German and Italian troops, but against the climate and landscape too.\n\nThe Libyan weather is âeither hot or very hotâ, as Dr Lyman puts it, ranging from around 35Â°C to 50Â°C.\n\nThe ground was rocky and inhospitable as well, making it very difficult to dig in under enemy fire, or shelter from the sun.\n\nSandstorms also caused huge problems on both sides. An extraordinary cloud of sand called the khamseen would regularly sweep in, leaving troops no choice but to lie down and cover their head to stop the sand from getting into their lungs. These sandstorms were capable of stripping the paint off armoured vehicles.\n\nThen, there were flies and fleas that were endemic among the troops, and the fact that the natural water available was quite oily. Allied soldiers initially thought the water supply had been poisoned, owing to its petrol-like taste.\n\nThe Allies were supplied each night by ship, which brought food and water and took away the wounded. This was colloquially known as âthe spud runâ â and was a lifeline to the besieged Allies.\n\nBut even with the spud run, rations were poor at best. One account noted:\n\nFollowing the siege\n\nAfter 241 days, this notorious chapter in the battle of Tobruk was over â but the fighting was soon to reach new heights. Rommel would create a new front to the west of Tobruk at Gazala. There, he would decisively defeat the Allies and overrun the port in the space of a day.\n\nThe Allies fled in a state of total panic and disarray back to El Alamein â just 70 miles from the crucial Allied stronghold of Alexandria, and worryingly close to the Egyptian capital of Cairo. There, British officials burned documents and retreated to the train stations, believing Egypt, Suez and the precious oilfields of the middle east were finally lost to Axis control.\n\nBut the Allies tactical victory at Tobruk was more important than they realised.\n\nThe 8th Army had survived. Next, it dug in, regrouped and fought two gruelling battles against the Axis powers at El Alamein, defeating Rommel in North Africa â and pushing onwards into Italy. Just a few years later, the German war machine was being throttled from the south, east and west.\n\nWhile Tobruk may sometimes be overshadowed by more decisive Allied victories in WW2, Dr Lyman notes how important it is to think about what would have happened had the defenders of Tobruk not held their ground, and the British Army not lifted the siege:\n\nâWe only got to [the Normandy landings of] 1944 because we were successful in 1941 and 1942 by the skin of our teeth. And thatâs why the anchor of Tobruk, and El Alamein a year later, are so essential to the survival of this country during the war. [Without Tobruk and El Alamein] there is no victory, and no opportunity to rebuild a British Army, because it would have been lost. The 8th Army was the core that would be deployed into Italy and then Normandy in 1944â.\n\nDr Robert Lyman"
