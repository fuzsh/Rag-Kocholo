        "text": "Hi @scotia and welcome to the forum\n\nHave you checked out the Battalion War Diary? If not it can currently be downloaded for free from the UK National Archive. You do have to sign in with your account, but if you don't have one even that can be set up at the same time as placing your first order. Just click on \"sign in\" on any page of the National Archive Catalogue and follow the instructions - no financial details are requested.\n\nThe relevant page of the National Archive for the 5/6th Battalion Royal Scots covering June 1916 to February 1919 can be found here https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7353762\n\nUnlikely to mention his name, but will give you some idea of where they were and what they were up to.\n\nI've not checked them all, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, (CWGC), shows 115 fatalities of the 5/6th Battalion on this day. A recurring theme in the few I looked at show them as now buried at Bouchoir New British Cemetery, but they were moved there post-war. Each man's webpage includes an additional contemporary document called a Concentration Report which gives a map reference for where the body was found - may be worth a fuller check as some of the 115 may have been recovered from the battlefield.\n\nThe CWGC webpage for the Bouchoir New British Cemetery has this on it's history - \"The village of Bouchoir passed into German hands on 27 March 1918 but was recovered by the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade on 9 August 1918. The New British Cemetery was made after the Armistice when graves were brought there from several small Commonwealth cemeteries and from the battlefields round Bouchoir and south of the village. Almost all date from March, April or August 1918 The cemetery now contains 763 burials and commemorations of the First World War. 231 of the burials are unidentified but there are special memorials to five casualties known or believed to be buried among them.\" https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/31900/bouchoir-new-british-cemetery/\n\nSo potentially your relative may be one of the unknowns.\n\nCheers,\n\nPeter\n\nHi to all,\n\nI would like to thank you all for such a swift reply to my request and the amount of information you have supplied me with has been excellent so thank you all very very much for this.\n\nA while back I was lucky to aquire my G,granfathers war records and I found out that he was previously wounded having taken a gunshot wound to the head (mild) on the 18/4/1918 at Wimereux while he was with the Royal Scots Fusiliers before being re asigned to the 5/6th Royal Scots in Calais on 30/6/1918. Then the next and last entry was Killed in action 11/8/1918 with place only mentioned as Field.. There are also several enscriptions on his records that I have a hard time deciphering and understanding but I hope to achieve this over time the more research I do.\n\nAs I mentioned in my post I plan to go to France this year in hope of getting as close to where my G,grandfather fell or his place of rest and would like to obtain as much acurate info as I can before I go.\n\nI have attached the casualty report docs for anyone who would like to see.\n\nOnce again many thanks for your time.\n\nCheers,\n\nPaul.\n\n2 hours ago, scotia said:\n\nThere are also several enscriptions on his records that I have a hard time deciphering and understanding but I hope to achieve this over time the more research I do.\n\nMerging the two documents and expanding on the terms used produces the following:-\n\n18th April 1918. Admitted 8th Stationary Hospital, Wimereux. Gun Shot Wound forehead (mild).\n\n-Gun shot wound is a generic term usually, so it shouldn’t automatically be assumed it was a rifle \\ pistol \\ machine-gun bullet.\n\n-Our parent site, The Long, Long Trail, confirms that the 8th Stationary Hospital was at Wimereux from March 1915 to March 1919. https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/british-base-hospitals-in-france/\n\n13th May 1918. Admitted 1 Convalescent Depot, Boulogne, recovering from being wounded.\n\n19th May 1918. Transferred to 10 Convalescent, Depot, Escault, recovering from Gun Shot Wound, forehead, mild.\n\n23rd May 1918. Transferred to 12 Convalescent Depot, Aubergue, recovering from Gun Shot wound, forehead, slight.\n\n16th June 1918. Having been found fit, reached “M” Scots (Infantry) Base Depot, Calais. There he would have been assessed to see if he was fit for further frontline service. If he was found so, then he would be held for a draft to go to the next units served by the Deport that needed replacement men.\n\n23rd June 1918. While still at the Depot he was administratively transferred to The Royal Scots Regiment.\n\n27th June 1918. Caught up with the 5/6th Battalion in the field.\n\n11th August 1918. Killed in action.\n\nThere may be more details available under his Royal Scots Fusiliers number – each point along the medical evacuation route was required to keep a medical admission register, and post-war a 5% sample was retained for statistical purposes. Subsequently they ended up with the National Archive who have sold the image rights to FindMyPast.\n\nUnfortunately I’m struggling to read a name –service number looks like 48296 and unit as Royal Scots Fusiliers, but I’m finding absolutely nothing at all for that combination – no service records or medals records – so can’t check it out any further.\n\nWith a name and number it will increase the odds of finding him on the casualty lists. I suspect his fate was know pretty much from the start in August 1918, but there is a possibility he was initially recorded as Missing.\n\nCheers,\n\nPeter\n\nOn 16/02/2023 at 10:59, scotia said:\n\nI have found my G,Grandfathers service numbers Royel Scots Fusiliers 48296 and 5/6 Royal Scots 51397. ...\n\nps. I noticed that James surname was spelled with a Y rather than IE on this casualty report.\n\nJames HARDIE, 51397, Royal Scots showing up in WFA/Fold3 pension ledger pages and index cards [another great resource from WFA]\n\nHere's the probably most interesting and informative pension index card\n\nImage thanks to WFA/Fold3\n\nMuch is self explanatory, but a bit of interpretation may assist/perhaps be of interest.\n\nOf course, there was this sad aftermath - his widow made a claim for a war pension for herself and for a pension allowance for her child under the prevailing Royal Warrant [which in this case would initially have been the 1918 RW] - usually under Article 11 [widow] and Article 12 [child], we can see a small variation from this from the records [see below].\n\nThis pension index card was in the soldier’s name and there was another briefer card in the widow’s name so they could be cross-referenced/accessed. These came from/lead to a ledger page(s) via the claim case references and then to an awards file. Unfortunately, the awards file probably deliberately destroyed once its use was passed [as was the common case]. There were also other cards as will be explained later.\n\nThe original Case No. 2595 claim reference was replaced by a later Ministry of Pensions one of 1/WH/314 and then 1/APW/6421 - the 1 representing pension region 1 [Scotland Region] and APW the Alternative Pension Widow's [the widow would have had to produce some sort to evidence that her husband’s earnings before his service were sufficiently high to entitle her to a higher widow's pension rate] The Article 13 refers to this APW option. Hence the APW, AP and APB[ranch] references. APW details partially recorded on a pension ledger page. We can see quite a significant increase in total quantum due to the APW later in 1919.\n\nThe date of birth, 2.8.94, is the widow’s - required because her pension could be age-related/supplemented if she was >45 [which she obviously was not]. Such an age banding of pension is believed to address the less likely possibility of re-marriage with increasing age.\n\nThe pension was paid to his widow combined with the child's allowance [there usually was an approx. 6 month gap between death and paying of a pension - sometimes a bit longer to allow for all the calculations to be undertaken] - in the meantime standard Separation Allowances continued to be paid.\n\nS.A. means Separation Allowance - A portion of a soldier's pay which was matched by the government and sent to his dependants to make sure they were not left destitute while he was on active service. SA were often more generous than a standard pensions and child’s allowance because a wife had to maintain a home in the same level of comfort as before ready for her husband’s return whilst a widow did not have such a need and costs – after all, apparently, she could then cut back and down-size her home! Typically, the no of SA on the card reflected the number of children - as seen here.\n\n50F is Form 50F used to cease the Separation Allowance and start the pension & allowance\n\nThe child's allowance was paid to their mother, typically until they reached 16 when such payments ceased [occasionally up to 21 if they were in some form of further vocational training or sometimes if they had impairment/disability] - then the child would certainly be expected to go out to work to earn their keep. Or paid until the earlier death of a child.\n\nShe also got a £6 grant, 18.9.18 to cover urgent expenses arising from her husband's death [£5 plus £1 respectively] - often for mourning dress [though not worn much at that time in the war], sometimes for moving home [typically downsizing as she would no longer be expected to keep a home in the same level of comfort as her husband might have expected had he returned!] - most commonly used for local newspaper death notice inserts [these quite often had a photo = so a good place to search, e.g at British Newspaper Archive or through Find my Past]\n\nDEAD,1933 indicates the claim became dead eventually - seemingly because her child reached 16 in 1932. This raises the question had his widow remarried [and lost her pension in favour of a one year value one-off remarriage bounty] or died by then? The answer is provided on other pension index cards - she had remarried, sometime after 4/23 [from printer's marks on cards], becoming WALKER - her new address becoming 13 Fielden St, Bridgeton\n\nI hope of value.\n\nM\n\n2 hours ago, scotia said:\n\nI noticed that James surname was spelled with a Y rather than IE on this casualty report.\n\nSo on the latest B.103 Casualty Form Active Service its looks like:-\n\n9th December 1915. Enlisted under the Derby Scheme. Serves for one days and is discharged to the Army Reserve, being sent home to carry on with his civilian occupation until called for. For more on the Derby Scheme, (aka The Group System), see our parent site, The Long, Long Trail. https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/soldiers/a-soldiers-life-1914-1918/enlisting-into-the-army/the-group-scheme-derby-scheme/\n\n17th November 1917. He is mobilised and posted to the 3rd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers, receiving Regiment service number 48296.\n\nThe 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers were based then at Greenock according to the LLT. https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/the-royal-scots-fusiliers-in-1914-1918/\n\nWhile in training, (most likely), qualifies as a Bomber.\n\n28th March 1918. He sails from Folkestone as part of a draft intended for a fighting Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers – I can’t make out if it is intended to read 1st or 6th – both were in France & Flanders. Lands Boulogne later the same day.\n\n29th March 1918. Reaches the Scots (Infantry) Base Depot at Calais\n\n30th March 1918. While at Base Depot re-assigned to the 15th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots, receiving a new Regimental Service number 51397.\n\n3rd (?) April 1918 – the report is dated 6th April 1918, so 8th seems inconsistent. Joins up with his Battalion, (15th?) in the field.\n\n15th (Service) Battalion (1st Edinburgh)\n\nFormed at Edinburgh in September 1914 by the Lord Provost and City, although some 550 men were recruited in Manchester and for this reason the Battalion is sometimes referred to as the Manchester Scottish. Moved to Troon March 1915.\n\nJune 1915 : moved to Ripon and came under command of 101st Brigade, 34th Division. Moved to Sutton Veny September 1915.\n\nLanded at Le Havre 8 January 1916.\n\n16 May 1918 : reduced to cadre strength after suffering heavy casualties.\n\nhttps://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-scots-lothian-regiment/\n\nWar Diary in the National Archive catalogue:- https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7353893\n\nIf the clerk completing the joint Victory Medal and British War Medal Roll, (available on Ancestry only), followed the instructions on the form, then it should show all units served with in a Theatre of War. Hopefully it will confirm he served with both the 15th and 5/6th Battalions – although compliance with the instructions can vary even from page to page of the Roll.\n\n17th April 1918. Wounded in the field, Gun shot wound to forehead, being medically evacuated via 63 Field Ambulance and 36 Casualty Clearing Station on the same day.\n\nTheir War Diaries will tell you where both were located on that day.\n\n63 Field Ambulance, attached 21st Division: https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7353145\n\n36 Casualty Clearing Station, attached Second Army : https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/551ce3a77c064517bc498fa19598e620\n\nHaving been medically evacuated as far back as the coast, the chances of him re-joining his previous unit diminished drastically by this stage of the war – which is why I think you see him posted to the 5/6th Battalion on recovery.\n\nHope that is of interest,\n\nPeter\n\nEdited 16 February , 2023 by PRC\n\nTypos"
