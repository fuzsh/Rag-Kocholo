        "text": "FAQs\n\nWhat is Monte Cassino famous for?\n\nMonte Cassino is famous for its ancient, Benedictine monastery situated at the top of a hill, close to Rome. Monte Cassino abbey is one of the largest monasteries in Italy, and is in turn known for the infamous Battle of Monte Cassino, and the abbeyâs destruction in 1944.\n\nWhy did they bomb Monte Cassino?\n\nThe Allied forces attacked the abbey of Monte Cassino with 350 tons of explosives as part of their effort to break the Germanâs defensive Gustav Line during World War Two. The Allies then made further air assaults on Monte Cassino and the town of Cassino to try to weaken the German forces positioned there.\n\nWho rebuilt Monte Cassino after WW2?\n\nThe Italian government paid for the reconstruction of Monte Cassino, although Abbot Ildefonso Rea made the appeal to restore the monastery two years after it was destroyed. Before they could rebuild the abbey, they had to remove more than 900,000 cubic yards of rubble from the site.\n\nCan you visit Monte Cassino?\n\nYes, you can visit the reconstructed abbey of Monte Cassino, which is situated in the Latin Valley of Italy. Visitors can explore the cloisters and the crypt, as well as the museum, and pay their respects at the Monte Cassino war memorials.\n\nWhat does Monte Cassino mean in Italian?\n\nMonte Cassino is the name for the hill above the town of Cassino, Italy, with Monte translating to mountain in English. In this sense, it essentially means âMount Cassinoâ. You might also see it referred to as Montecassino in Italian."
