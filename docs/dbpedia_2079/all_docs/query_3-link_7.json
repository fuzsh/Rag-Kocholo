T.F.\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nOn the outbreak of the conflict, the Division's pre-war establishment units were mobilised individually rather than in their divisional formation, and were initially used for garrison duty overseas in Malta, or as reinforcements for other divisions on the Western Front. In January 1916 the Division was re-constituted as a fighting formation in the Abbeville district in France, consisting of:\n\n167th Infantry Brigade[]\n\n1/1st London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), T.F.\n\n1/3rd London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), T.F.\n\n1/7th Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own), T.F.\n\n1/8th Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own), T.F.\n\n168th Infantry Brigade[]\n\n1/4th London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), T.F.\n\n1/12th London Regiment (The Rangers), T.F.\n\n1/13th London Regiment (The Kensingtons), T.F.\n\n1/14th London Regiment (London Scottish), T.F.\n\n169th Infantry Brigade[]\n\n1/2nd London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers), T.F.\n\n1/5th London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade), T.F.\n\n1/9th London Regiment (Queen Victoria Rifles), T.F.\n\n1/16th London Regiment (Queen's Westminster Rifles), T.F.\n\nSupport Units[]\n\nArtillery[]\n\n280th (1/1st London) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, T.F.\n\n281st (1/2nd London) Brigade, R.F.A., T.F.\n\n282nd (1/3rd London) Brigade, R.F.A., T.F.\n\n283rd (1/4th London) Brigade, R.F.A., T.F.\n\n56th Divisional Ammunition Column, T.F.\n\nRoyal Engineers[]\n\n416th (1/1st Edinburgh) Field Company, T.F.

It was demobilised in May 1919.\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nAt the outbreak of war in September 1939, the division was mobilised as motorised infantry under the title of the 1st London Division. It was reorganised as an infantry division in June 1940 and redesignated as the 56th (London) Infantry Division on 18 November 1940. The divisional insignia during the Second World War was changed to an outline of a black cat in a red background. The cat stood for Dick Whittington's cat, a symbol of London.\n\nThe division remained in the United Kingdom during the Battle of France, moving to the Middle East in November 1942, where it served in Iraq and Palestine until moving to Egypt in March 1943 and thence forward to Libya, and the front, in April. This involved the division travelling some 2,300 miles by road, a notable achievement and testament to the organization of the division and the ability of its mechanics and technicians. The division sat out the Allied invasion of Sicily (except for the 168th Brigade, which was attached to the understrength 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and moved to Italy in September 1943 and saw service in the Battle of Monte Cassino, in January, serving there until March 1944 and participated in the Anzio Campaign. After being withdrawn to Egypt at the end of March, the division returned to Italy in July 1944, where it took part in the Battles along the Gothic Line and remained there until after VE Day.\n\nAfter crossing the Volturno in October 1943, the division entered the town of Calvi Vecchia. Their attempts to radio the United States Fifth Army to cancel a planned bombing on the town failed. As a last resort, the 56th released an American homing pigeon named G.I. Joe, which carried a message that reached the allies just as the planes were being warmed up. The attack was called off and the town was saved from the planned air assault.[1][2]\n\nOrder of battle[]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nThe division comprised four infantry brigades:\n\n167th (London) Infantry Brigade\n\n8th Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\n9th Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\n7th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry\n\n168th (London) Brigade\n\n1st London Scottish Regiment\n\n1st London Irish Rifles\n\n10th Royal Berkshire Regiment\n\n1st Welch Regiment\n\n169th (London) Infantry Brigade\n\n2nd/5th Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)\n\n2nd/6th Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)\n\n2nd/7th Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)\n\n201st Guards Motor Brigade\n\n3rd Coldstream Guards\n\n6th Grenadier Guards\n\nThe 24th Guards Brigade was assigned to the Division in Italy on 18 February 1945.[3]\n\nBattles[]\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nEnfidaville – 19 April 1943 – 29 April 1943\n\nTunis – 5 May 1943 – 12 May 1943\n\nSalerno – 9 September 1943 – 18 September 1943\n\nCapture of Naples – 22 September 1943 – 1 October 1943\n\nVolturno Crossing – 12 October 1943 – 15 October 1943\n\nMonte Camino – 5 November 1943 – 9 December 1943\n\nGarigliano Crossing – 17 January 1944 – 31 January 1944\n\nAnzio – 22 January 1944 – 22 May 1944\n\nGothic Line – 25 August 1944 – 22 September 1944\n\nCoriano – 3 September 1944 – 15 September 1944\n\nRimini Line – 14 September 1944 – 21 September 1944\n\nLamone Crossing – 2 December 1944 – 13 December 1944\n\nArgenta Gap – 12 April 1945 – 21 April 1945\n\nPost War[]\n\nIn 1946, the 56th Division was demobilised then re-constituted as the 56th (London) Armoured Division, T.A. The new formation included the 22nd Armoured Brigade and the 168th Lorried Infantry Brigade, with the Inns of Court and City Yeomanry acting as the Division's reconnaissance unit.\n\nOn 20 December 1955, the Secretary of State for War informed the House of Commons that the armoured divisions and the 'mixed' division were to be converted to infantry.[4] The 56th Division was one of the eight divisions placed on a lower establishment for home defence only.[5] The territorial units of the Royal Armoured Corps were also reduced in number to nine armoured regiments and eleven reconnaissance regiments. This was effected by the amalgamation of pairs of regiments, and the conversion of four RAC units to an infantry role.\n\nOn 20 July 1960, a further reduction of the TA was announced in the House of Commons. The Territorials were to be reduced from 266 fighting units to 195. The reductions were carried out in 1961, mainly by the amalgamation of units. On 1 May 1961, the TA divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts and matched with Civil Defence Regions to aid the mobilisation for war.[6] Thus the division ceased to exist as an independent entity, and was linked to London District.\n\nThe 4th Battalion, Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment was formed in 1961 by the amalgamation of the 6th Bn., East Surrey Regiment and the 23rd London Regiment, with a Battalion HQ and HQ Company at Kingston upon Thames.[7] It formed part of 47th (London) Infantry Brigade (56th London Division/District).\n\nAn echo of the Division emerged again from 1987 to 1993, when the public duties battalions in the London District were grouped as the 56th Infantry Brigade.\n\nSee also[]\n\nBritish Divisions in World War II\n\nBritish Army Order of Battle - September 1939\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
