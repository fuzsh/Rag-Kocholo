Frank Costa was born in Brooklyn to Eugene and Antoinetta Costa, both of whom had been born in Italy. Frank had four older sisters and an older brother, all born in New York. At the time of the 1930 federal census, Frank’s father was employed as a foreman. By 1940, according to that year’s federal census, 16-year-old Frank was living on East 38th Street with his family, which had grown to include a younger brother and a niece.\n\nAccording to his daughter, Costa attended Brooklyn Technical High School, and completed two years there. He was living at home on East 38th Street when he registered for the draft in 1942 at age 18. He was described then as standing 5′ 7″ tall, 172 pounds, with brown eyes and hair and a light complexion. According to his obituary, before Frank was inducted into the Army in February, 1943, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, where he spent time fighting forest fires in Idaho.\n\nCosta’s military assignment was with Battery B in the 161st Field Artillery Battalion, part of the 35th Infantry Division. He was a cannoneer—part of a gun crew—and in 1944 qualified as a carbine sharpshooter, the middle level of three possible qualifications. The 161st Battalion arrived in France in late May 1944. Costa took part in the Ardennes, Central Europe, Normandy, Northern France, and Rhineland battles and campaigns. He was injured in combat but, according to his daughter, refused the Purple Heart in order to keep his mother from worrying about the extent of his injuries. His other military honors were the American Service Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Service Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal.\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle listed Costa’s name as among the local boys of the 161st Battalion arriving back in the United States aboard the Queen Mary on September 10, 1945. There were more than 14,000 American troops on that ship. Eight weeks later, Costa was honorably discharged from the Army at Fort Dix, New Jersey.\n\nAfter the war, Costa worked in Brooklyn for many decades as a cab driver, according to his obituary.

However, his son reports that Vincent was a “medic in the army, treating the injured before transmitting them to the hospital. He also serviced military vehicles.” His son also shares that Vincent did his tour of duty in Italy, France, Africa, and Germany.

Despite the danger from fire and potential explosions of the bombs, Coughlin, who was a member of the Fire Department Crash Crew, rushed to the crash site to assist with firefighting and caring for the soldiers who had been injured in the plane crash. As a result of Coughlin’s heroic actions, his commanding officer issued a commendation which recited the facts and concluded, “This action on your part, while in constant danger due to the possibility of bombs exploding and fires spreading, displayed qualities of courage and consideration for the safety of fellow-officers which are worthy of high commendation.” According to articles from the Hawaii Times dated April 14, 1943 and April 16, 1943, several soldiers and one civilian were killed and seven civilians were injured in the accident. While stationed in Hawaii, Coughlin would have transitioned to a combat role in the Pacific Theater of Operations; however, the war ended before that happened.\n\nCoughlin and Helen M.

A little more than a year later, the attack at Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war, and DiCostanzo would spend his years in the Asia/ Pacific theater, serving in China, India, and Burma. Wearing his “sweetheart pin” in the United States was his wife, Christine M. Fasulo, whom he married on November 10, 1942.\n\nSome of his father’s experience with ships as a longshoreman must have rubbed off on his son, and DiCostanzo received his first wartime commendation from the Office of Provost Marshal Captain James T. Pronger of the transport ship that took the men from the United States to Hobart, Tasmania, for performing the duties of sergeant of the guard. The Ordnance Department, in which he served, returned the damaged materials that the troops required to operational status. From base shop work to organizational maintenance near the front lines, this work was accomplished as quickly as possible in order to keep the Army supplied and moving ahead in the field. Beyond the aforementioned commendation, DiCostanzo’s achievements during the war were recognized with the American Defense Service Medal, the Meritorious Unit Emblem, the American Campaign, Bronze Asiatic-Pacific, and World War II Victory Medals, as well a commendation for Good Conduct.\n\nThese medals would have adorned his uniform when he returned to Brooklyn after the war, and during dress occasions as post commander of the Fighting 14th Infantry Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In addition to those duties, DiCostanzo worked for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for thirty years and, together with his wife Christine, raised three children, Mary, Susan and Vincent.

Born into an Italian-American family, he was one of fourteen children. As a child and through his teenage years, Di Orio was an active parishioner of St. Rocco’s Church (located in Sunset Park). As a teen, he was a drum major of the St. Rocco’s Cadet Corps.\n\nDi Orio enlisted in the United States Army on March 16, 1943. As a private first-class infantry radio and communications operator, he and the 3rd Infantry Division of the United States Army served in all ten campaigns of World War II. Di Orio and the 3rd Division fought in North Africa, working their way through Sicily, ending the Sicilian Campaign. They broke to Rome, continued to the south of France, and, eventually, fought in Austria towards the end of the war. The 3rd Division was credited with 531 combat days, which was the most combat days of any unit in the European Theater. Di Orio was wounded in Anzio, Italy. He received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his contributions and efforts. Di Orio was discharged from the United States Army on October 25, 1945, returning home to Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\n\nOn June 9, 1945, Di Orio married Lena Masucci. They started a family, having four children, Andrew Jr., Kathryn Nagy, Richard, and Robert, with Richard and Robert sadly passing away in early adulthood. Di Orio was a grandfather to four grandchildren, Andrew III, Tracy, Michael and Rebecca, and great-grandfather to three great-grandchildren, Isabella, Dominique and Andrew IV.\n\nAfter his return from the war, Di Orio worked as the lead foreman in charge of the Brooklyn Army Terminal and three other ports. In 1956, he left this position to manage the newly constructed St. Rocco’s Youth Center at St. Rocco’s Church, his lifelong parish. For the next 25 years, Di Orio nurtured members of the youth group. He was a great influence and support system for the youth in the community, providing opportunities in recreation and education. He supervised the roller-skating rink, taught offset printing, and coordinated the basketball team. In addition, he brought back the Cadet Corps and proceeded to transform it into St. Rocco’s Drum & Bugle Corps, a full-fledged competitive marching and maneuvering corps. Although proud of the success in competition of the Drum & Bugle Corps, Di Orio was most proud of the inclusivity of members during a time when activities often were racially divided. Di Orio welcomed all members, regardless of race. In response to DiOrio’s impact on establishing the Drum & Bugle Corps, a former member of the youth center said, “If it were not for his efforts in building the Youth Center, I fear many of us would have been lost to the street.” (Obituary of Andrew “Andy” Di Orio, Legacy.com).\n\nIn the 1980s, while remaining a very active member of St. Rocco’s Parish, Di Orio left his position as general manager of the Youth Center. He embarked on a new career with the Kings County Court, where he was appointed as the principal administrative associate for the public administrator of Kings County. He also held the position of court analyst for the Surrogate Court of Brooklyn. He then served as deputy public administrator of Kings County until he retired.\n\nDi Orio was very active in his community. He was a member of Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee, the Knights of Columbus Christopher Council, Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, Sons of Italy, South Brooklyn Lions, and was on the board of directors of the Marien-Heim Towers of Sunset Park. He served 17 years as chairman of Community Board 7. He was instrumental in getting Sunset Park designated as a Neighborhood Strategy Area, receiving 10 million dollars for improvements to the area, including a new sanitation garage, construction of a new school-P.S.314, and upgrades to parks, sewers, and street lighting throughout the area.\n\nHis efforts and dedication did not go unnoticed. He received numerous awards and recognitions, such as Man of the Year from the Yankee Circuit and YMCA, Bishop Mugavero Award, Leif Erikson League Board of Directors Award, Panza-Sterrazza Memorial Service Award, and the 72nd Precinct Community Award. Upon his retirement, Di Orio was acknowledged by the Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden and New York City Mayor Edward Koch for his seventeen years of service to Brooklyn and Community Board 7.\n\nHe remained a resident of Sunset Park until his death. To recognize his hard work, influence, and dedication to the community, the street in front of the St. Rocco’s Youth Center, at 27th Street and 4th Avenue, has been named Andrew Di Orio Boulevard.

His employer was listed as E.W. Bliss and Company, a Brooklyn machine tool manufacturer.\n\nShortly thereafter, DiSpirito and Rose Casale applied for a marriage license, and they would go on to have three children. However, their happy family life was interrupted by DiSpirito’s deployment. He served in the Philippines as an Army combat engineer. The combat engineers were at the forefront of fighting theaters in World War II, enabling mobility operations for the troops, enacting counter-mobility operations against Axis powers, and serving as infantrymen when necessary. They constructed roads, bridges, and fortifications while also laying mines and destroying enemy infrastructure, using a wide variety of tools to accomplish this, from hand axes to dynamite to bulldozers. In the Pacific Theater, the U.S. Army 42nd Combat Engineers took part in the hard-fought high casualty Battle of Attu and the Battle of Manila, earning two Battle Stars. While we do not know the unit that DiSpirito was attached to, we do know he ranked as a sergeant by the end of his service, and according to his family, he served for four years.\n\nAfter his service, DiSpirito went on to work for Wackenhut Security. He last lived in Brooklyn. Section 28, lot 40963.\n\nDONNELLY, JOSEPH R. (1919-1975). Sergeant, Press, United States Army. Joseph Donnelly was born in Queens, New York.

His draft registration card records that he was working at the Plaza Hotel at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. His World War II Army enlistment records note that he had a grammar school education and a semi-skilled occupation in the production of paint and varnish.
