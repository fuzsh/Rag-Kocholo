        "text": "Nicknames of British Units during the Napoleonic Wars\n\nBy John Cook and Robert Burnham, FINS\n\nMost military units throughout the world have a nickname that they are often called in an informal setting. Sometimes these nicknames are given out of respect for some heroic deed, but more often they were given to the unit by people outside of the unit to make fun of it. The reasons why units received these negative nicknames varied from misconduct on the field to the color of their uniforms to their pretensions.\n\nUnfortunately over the years, even though the nickname has stuck, the reasons why they were given have been lost,. The British Army is rich in tradition and in many cases not only have the nicknames survived, but the reason why they received it has also. Interestingly, in a sampling of 60 British memoirs and diaries from the Napoleonic Wars, very few of the writers referred to their own units by their nicknames, which would re-inforce the negative side of the nickname.\n\nThe nicknames listed below are from a variety of sources. In some cases we were able to pinpoint exactly when the nickname came into use (such as the \"Die Hards\" for the 57th Foot). In others, the nicknames were in use prior to the Napoleonic Wars. Although the nickname may have been earned 50 - 75 years earlier, the regiment was still referred to by the nickname ( such as the \"Slashers\" for the 28th Foot.) In other cases, the nickname was earned earlier and was recorded in the regiment's official history, but it is difficult to determine whether they were still used.\n\nNicknames of the Divisions\n\nDuring the Peninsula War, the British Army was organized into eight infantry divisions. Each division had a nickname, usually based upon some action they had participated in.\n\nCavalry Regiments\n\nInfantry Regiments\n\nRegiment\n\nNickname\n\nFirst Used\n\nReason for Nickname\n\nFoot Guards\n\nOld Eyes\n\nPeninsula\n\nGiven to them by Light Dragoons\n\n1st Foot Guards\n\nThe Tow-Rows\n\nUnknown\n\nFrom the regimental march\n\nThe Coalers\n\n1600s\n\nThe regiment's officers once hired the men out to 'heave' coal to raise money to refurbish the officers' mess at St James' Palace.\n\n2nd (Coldstream) Foot Guards\n\nColdstreamers\n\n1600s\n\nRecruited from Coldstream, Scotland\n\n1st Foot\n\nPontius Pilate's Bodyguards\n\n1630s\n\nIt is the oldest regiment in the British army. Originally Régiment de Douglas; when in French service, the story goes that at a regimental 'function', to which officers of the Régiment Picardy had been invited, a dispute arose concerning which regiment was the oldest. An officer from the Régiment Picardy claimed that his regiment was the oldest in any army, anywhere, and that the Régiment Picardy had been on duty on the night following the Crucifixion. He then promptly passed out. An officer of the Douglas' replied that the Picardies must have been asleep at their posts, and that if the Régiment de Douglas had been on duty Christ would not have been crucified. Now, the flawed logic of this will not have escaped you, since on the night following the Crucifixion the deed was already done and, as a result they received the nickname.\n\n2nd Foot\n\nKirke's Lamb\n\n1682\n\nRegimental badge is the Paschal Lamb and they were commanded by a Colonel Kirke\n\n3rd Foot\n\nThe Buffs\n\n1700s/1800s\n\nBecause of their facing color\n\nThe Resurrectionists\n\n1810\n\nBecause of the large number of wounded men and those who escaped from the French who returned after Albuera\n\nResurrection Men\n\n1810\n\nSame as above\n\n4th Foot\n\nThe Lions\n\n1685\n\nRegimental badge had a lion\n\n5th Foot\n\nThe Fighting Fifth\n\nPeninsula\n\nWellington's comment \"The ever fighting, often tried, but never failing fifth.\"\n\nWellington's Bodyguard\n\nPeninsula\n\nOften served as the Army HQ guard\n\nThe Old and Bold\n\nc1808\n\nBecause of service at Rolica\n\n6th Foot\n\nSaucy 6th\n\n1790s\n\nBecause of high recruiting standards\n\n7th Foot\n\nThe Elegant Extracts\n\n1685\n\nWhen the regiment was raised, the officers came from many different regiments\n\n8th Foot\n\nThe Leather Hats\n\nc1780\n\nUsed civilian hats during American War of Independence\n\n9th Foot\n\nThe Fighting Ninth\n\nc1808\n\nUnknown\n\nThe Holy Boys\n\nPeninsula\n\nSpanish thought the figure of Britannia on their shako plate was the Virgin Mary\n\n10th Foot\n\nThe Yellow Bellies\n\n1700s/1800s\n\nAfter the Yellow Belly frog that lives in the Lincolnshire Fens\n\nThe Springers\n\n1776\n\nWas used as light infantry during the American War of Independence\n\n11th Foot\n\nBloody Eleventh\n\n1812\n\nDue to heavy casualties at Salamanca (340 of 412)\n\n12th Foot\n\nThe Old Twelfth\n\n1700s\n\nNumber of Regiment\n\nThe Old Dozen\n\n1700s\n\nNumber of Regiment\n\n14th Foot\n\nCalvert's Entire\n\nc1806\n\nColonel was Sir Harry Calvert and had three battalions from 1806 to 1824\n\n15th Foot\n\nThe Snappers\n\n1777\n\nAt the Battle of Brandywine the regiment ran short of ball which was distributed to the best shots, whilst the remainder 'snapped' powder charges only.\n\n16th Foot\n\nThe Old Bucks\n\n1700s/1800s\n\nFrom Buckinghamshire and senior to the 85th Regiment\n\n17th Foot\n\nThe Tigers\n\nc1804\n\nFor service in India; its regimental badge was the Bengal Tiger.\n\n18th Foot\n\nPaddy's Blackguards\n\n1684\n\nWas an Irish Regiment\n\nThe Namurs\n\n1695\n\nFor service at Namur\n\n19th Foot\n\nThe Green Howards\n\n1740\n\nBecause of facing color and their colonel was named Howard\n\n20th Foot\n\nKingsley's Stand\n\n1759\n\nHaving been stood-down by the Duke of Brunswick and placed in reserve due to casualties after Minden, Major General Kingsley, also Colonel of the regiment, declined to obey the order with the words \"Kingsley's Regiment, at its own request will resume its portion of duty in the line.\"\n\nThe Two Tens\n\n1700s/1800s\n\nBecause their regimental number was always shown in Roman numerals thus XX\n\nThe Minden Boys\n\n1700s/1800s\n\nService at Minden\n\nYoung Fusiliers 1800s Possibly because they joined the Fusilier Brigade in 1812\n\n21st Foot\n\nGrey Breeks\n\n1600s/1700s\n\nWhen first raised, wore grey trousers\n\n22nd Foot\n\nThe Red Knights\n\n1795\n\nUniform was entirely red: coat, waistcoat and trousers\n\nThe Two Twos\n\n1800s\n\nBecause of regimental number\n\n23rd Foot\n\nNanny Goats\n\n1800s\n\nMascot was a goat\n\nRoyal Goats\n\n1800s\n\nMascot was a goat\n\n24th Foot\n\nHoward's Greens\n\n1737\n\nTo prevent confusion with 19th Foot, who also had green facings and a colonel called Howard\n\n27th Foot\n\nThe Skins\n\nc1800\n\nCorruption of Inniskilling, from where they were recruited\n\n28th Foot\n\nThe Slashers\n\n1775\n\nAt the Battle of White Plains, the regiment had to leave its muskets behind to climb a cliff and drove the rebels from their positions with their short swords.
