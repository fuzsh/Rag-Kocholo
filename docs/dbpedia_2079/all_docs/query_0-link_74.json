        "text": "The first day of the Battle of the Somme was the worst day in the history of the British Army.\n\nAt 7:30am on July 1, 1916, thousands of British soldiers began an attack against a German trench line which was supposed to have been destroyed. It wasn't. Over the next 12 hours 29,000 people were killed and many more wounded. Many of those who survived were changed forever – as was the world, and Britain's understanding of itself.\n\nScroll down and read upwards to follow the events of that momentous day, minute by minute and hour by hour, just as they happened 100 years ago.\n\nSources\n\nIn assembling this account I am deeply indebted to the scholarship of the following:\n\nRobert Kershaw: 24 Hours at the Somme (WH Allen)\n\nMartin Middlebrook: The First Day on the Somme (Pen & Sword)\n\nJohn Keegan: The Face of Battle (Vintage)\n\nEdward Liveing: 24 Hours on the Somme (Amberley)\n\nAndrew Roberts: Elegy (Head of Zeus)\n\nGarry Sheffield: Douglas Haig – From Somme to Victory (Aurum)\n\nWilliam Philpott: Bloody Victory (Abacus)\n\nPaul Fussell: The Great War and Modern Memory (OUP)\n\nSiegfried Sassoon: Memoirs of an Infantry Officer (Faber)\n\nCecil Lewis: Sagittarius Rising (Pen & Sword)\n\nGeoffrey Malins: How I Filmed The War (Project Gutenberg)\n\nI would also like to thank the following for their generous help:\n\nThe National Army Museum\n\nStuart Eastwood at Cumbria's Museum of Military Life\n\nPeter Donnelly of the King's Own Royal Regiment Museum\n\nDavid Stevenson (info boxes) and Richard Burgess (graphics)\n\nJacob Furedi and Olivia O'Neill who helped greatly with research\n\nNigel Jones for showing me where to look\n\nConclusion: July 2, 1916\n\n\"Thank God! At last! A Blighty wound!\"\n\nEdward Liveing has made it to the field ambulance station, far behind the British lines. After almost being shot in the face by his own side as he crawled towards a firing line before tumbling back down into his own trenches, he is safe – apart from the occasional shrapnel shells falling nearby. To get out of the sun he has been placed in the officers' hut.\n\nOne man has forgotten his own name and argues vociferously with an ambulance corporal. Another believes he is still fighting:\n\n\"Keep 'em off, boys, keep 'em off! Give me a bomb, sergeant. Get down! My God! I'm hit. Put some more of those sandbags on the barricade. These damned shells! Can I stand it any longer? Come on, boys. Come along, sergeant! WE mut go for them! Oh! My God! I must stick it!\n\nLiveing cannot know it, but a crisis has developed. Despite Rawlinson's explicit requests, the Army has not provided enough ambulance trains. There is a gigantic backlog of moaning, screaming, dying men clogging up the casualty clearing stations. But not here.\n\nDecision points\n\nThe Germans too are under severe pressure as the French advance rapidly in the south. Behind the lines, Generalleutnant von Stein is throwing everything at Schwaben that he can.\n\n“In order to block a breakthrough on the left wing, I had to take battalion after battalion from the right wing, that had just defeated the attack. They had to be taken out, put on lorries and thrown against the left wing.”\n\nAs he orders out the final battalion, a staff officer objects: “Excellency, that is the last one!” Von Stein reponds: “Never forget this moment in your entire life. One has to find the right decision and commit the last, because the enemy can also be at the end of his tether.”\n\nPanic spreads among the Brits\n\nVon Bram’s three-pronged counter-attack is finally under way. Brits occupying the old German gun position at Grandcourt are charged twice with bayonets, forced out, and shot down as they flee.\n\nThe ejection sends a little spark of panic through the redoubt as the survivors dash for safety. Lieutenant Colonel F.O. Bowen, with the Belfast Young Brigade, recalls:\n\n\"We had to stop them at revolver point and turn them back, a desperate show, the air stiff with shrapnel, and terror-stricken men rushing blindly. These men did magnificently earlier in the day, but they had reached the limit of their endurance.\"\n\nThe jaws slowly close around the Ulstermen\n\nThe bruised and battered Ulsters are getting desperate. All afternoon they have been shelled, machine gunned, and attacked by waves of infantry, all from three sides at once. Now even field guns are being fired at them.\n\n\"We should call it a draw and I'll give you our garden in with it!\" remarks one soldier to Private FG Gardener, a trench mortar operator. Squads of Germans can be seen moving through the communication trenches.\n\nThe sun beats down. One man tries to drink his own urine.\n\nFighting still rages at the Schwaben Redoubt\n\nFriedrich Hinkel has been holding the southern flank of the Schwaben line, sniping at steel helmets and throwing grenades down at lost groups of Tommies. \"These lads did not seem to know where they were in our trenches,\" he observes.\n\nBut his own men are being hunted from above by British aeroplanes. The pilots look for the little puffs of white cooling steam produced by machine guns as they cool, and swoop in on the crews, scattering their brains across the shattered trees.\n\n\"I am the only officer left. Please send instructions.”\n\nAt Gommecourt Cedric Dickens sends a final message.\n\n“I have as far as I can find only 13 men left beside myself. Trenches unrecognisable. Quite impossible to hold. Bombardment fearful for two hours. I am the only officer left. Please send instructions.”\n\nHowe is wounded in an abortive charge\n\nThe whistles blow and once again Philip Howe climbs out of the trench.\n\nA single German machine gun opens fire. Its bullets graze Howe's face and punch through his rifle sling. The attack goes twenty yards before it takes so many casualties that it has to turn back. In three minutes 123 men have been killed or wounded.\n\nHaig: \"I have great hopes of getting some measure of success\"\n\nNewfoundlanders all but wiped out\n\nThe Ulsters hit a \"wall of flame\"\n\nThe last charge of the Lonsdales\n\nIn many places the British have managed to take parts of the German trench system. But anyone trying to reinforce them still has to cross No Man’s Land through a storm of artillery and machine guns.\n\nIn Authuille Wood the Lonsdales – a Pals battalion of the Border Regiment, drawn from Carlisle and Cumberland – leaves its reserve trench. These men have worked together – on the railways, in the iron ore mines, in the Carr’s biscuit factory – and they’ve trained together, on the racecourse in Carlisle. They have to move across open ground to their own front line before they even get to No Man’s Land.\n\nThe machine guns are waiting. Between the forest and the front line they lose around 250 men. In No Man’s Land they lose another 250. In all they lose 25 out of 28 officers and 519 ordinary soldiers out of 800.\n\nThis pattern is repeated across the Somme as brigade after brigade sticks to the plan.\n\nCrawling back to safety\n\nEdward Liveinglies by the German wire, listening to the chaotic noise. A familiar sergeant appears from the smoke. Their conversation is typically genteel.\n\n\"‘Hallo, K,’ I shouted.\n\n‘Are you hit, sir?’ he asked.\n\n‘Yes, old chap, I am,’ I replied.\n\n‘You had better try and crawl back,’ he suggested.\n\n‘I don’t think I can move,’ I said.\n\n‘I’ll take off your equipment for you.’\n\nTogether they start to crawl back to the British line. “Little holes keep” opening up in the ground around them – machine gun fire.\n\nTheir attempt is being mirrored on enormous scale across the field. Men whose attacks have faltered are sheltering in shell holes, occasionally sniping back at the Germans, but mostly trying to get back to their own lines. Many don't.\n\nThe Salford Pals lose 60 per cent in minutes\n\nIn Thiepval Wood the next wave of Irish troops prepare themselves. Many intone the Lord's Prayer under their breath. Shells are falling into the forest and trees are burningall around them like absurd candles. The whistles blow.\n\nNearby the 2nd Salford Pals have been watching the carnage; they know they are next. Captain Thomas Tweed, from Eccles, has personally recruited many of these men from the dockyards and mines, just three years after quite possibly beating them up as a special constable during the 1911 Liverpool strikes. Now he has to watch them die. In the kill zones his hundred-strong company is reduced to 40.\n\nA former shop assistant is sent back to call for reinforcements, but shot down as soon as he breaks cover. Tweed tries to write a second message but the notebook is shot out of his hands. The Salfords will be pinned down here for the next two hours.\n\nSausage and Mash\n\nNear the village of La Boiselle the British are advancing up two fortified valleys, \"Sausage\" and \"Mash\". Within ten minutes of attacking 80 per cent of the first wave troops are dead or wounded. The first soldiers to reach the parapet disappear in the plume of a German flame thrower.\n\nIn Sausage the Germans wait until the Brits are very close and then let loose. They are so eager, and the slaughter so complete, that many of them stand up in the open on the lip of their trench to shoot down into the valley.\n\nHaig: \"Reports most satisfactory\"\n\nAt his chateau headquarters, Haig reviews his messages.\n\n“Reports up to 8am most satisfactory. Our troops had everywhere crossed the enemy’s front frenches.”\n\nThe second line\n\nAs the first wave of Ulstermen force their way further in, Germans they have missed pop up behind them and start shooting. Machine guns strafe them from the villages on either side.\n\nThe fighting is savage. Lewis gunner Hugh Stewart recalls:\n\n\"I had never killed a man with a bayonet before and it sent cold shivers up and down my spine many's a night afterwards just thinking about it.\"\n\nThe attack is quickly unravelling\n\nRawlinson's fatal mistake\n\nLt Gen Rawlinson observes the action\n\nPilots, to your machines\n\nAt a British airfield behind the lines, Lieutenant Cecil Lewis is tending to his plane.\n\nAt just 18 years old he is a charming if reckless adventurer with many flight hours under his belt. Fascinated by the strange sights of war, enchanted by the power and majesty of flight, and most enamoured of the local women, his motto is: “Live gloriously, generously, dangerously. Safety last!”\n\nBut the war in the air is taking its toll. Day after day of rolling the dice and surviving while his friends die without warning has given him a false sense of invulnerability, and a penchant for unnecessary risks.\n\nFor weeks now he has been photographing the battlefield, observing , shooting down German observation balloons (and sometimes French ones by accident). The Allies have complete superiority in the air.\n\nLike many of the troops, he is convinced that today the German line will be broken, and the cavalry finally unleashed.\n\nThe hour approaches\n\nTo the south, in the centre of the British line near Ovillers, Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Bastard of the 2nd Lincolns reports with his fellow battalion commanders to brigade HQ for a final conference.\n\nTheir discussion is short. They synchronise their watches, wish each other luck, and go back through the intensifying German shellfire.\n\nUnlike the Kitchener men, Bastard is a regular soldier, an Eton graduate and a veteran of the Boer War. Professionals like him and his men, as well as formerly part-time Territorials, make up about half the British force of the Somme.\n\nThey are a spirited lot: while on parade, an unknown man had heckled his brigade commander: \"It's all right for you – you won't be there!\" But the commander took it in good spirit, calling back: \"No, I won't, but you will be.\" The previous night they held a concert in a field near the town of Albert, with loud renditions of popular songs.\n\nA clear dawn\n\nLt Edward Liveingof the London Regiment has hardly slept.\n\nFor seven days British artillery has been pounding the German lines in preparation for the offensive. More shells have been fired this week than in the whole of the war so far. And tonight, the night before the “big push”, it has been particularly intense.\n\nLiveing’s platoon is on the far north of the British advance, part of a huge diversionary attack aimed at the German-held town of Gommecourt. He recalls:\n\n“The wind blew east, and a few fleecy clouds raced along the blue sky overhead. The sun was infusing more warmth into the air. There was a freshness and splendour of a summer morning over everything. In fact, as one man said, it felt more as if were were going to start off for a picnic than for a battle.”\n\nIntroduction: July 1, 1916\n\nIt is now 21 months since the greatest war in modern memory collapsed into an exhausted stalemate. The Allies and the Central Powers face each other across 12,000 miles of fortified trench, neither side able to break through.\n\nSince December 1915 the French and the British have been planning a joint offensive to end the deadlock. Their goal was to attack on either side of the river Somme, a sleepy sector where both sides have settled into a comfortable routine. But in February the Germans struck first, drawing the French into a desperate struggle over their own soil at the Battle of Verdun. As casualties mounted the British were forced to take charge of the Somme offensive, which has now become a relief effort.\n\nThe task falls in part to \"Kitchener’s Army\" – two million volunteers who walked out of their factories, cricket clubs and insurance offices in that first golden flush of patriotic enthusiasm. Many have joined up with their friends, workplaces, football teams or unions; tiny communities have contributed whole battalions. What they are about to go through will change them forever: the largest battle of the First World War, the breaking of two armies, and the birth of the 20th century.\n\nThe night before the battle, Field Marshal Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, writes in his diary: “With God’s help, I feel hopeful for tomorrow.”"
