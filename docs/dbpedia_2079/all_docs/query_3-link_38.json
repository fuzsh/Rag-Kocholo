The medium-scale combined exercise was held Aug. 4-6 and was the first-ever exercise held in the state intended to conduct an agile combat employment (ACE) assessment across the state’s three Air National Guard wings. While exercising ACE concepts, the exercise increased tactical proficiency, developed a baseline knowledge in dissimilar operations, and combined capabilities and resources across three major commands to maximize operational success in a contested environment against a near-peer adversary.

Gen. Mark Schindler, Pennsylvania’s adjutant general. “Thanks to the unfailing support of the families and employers of our great service members, we are always ready, always there, to serve our community, our commonwealth and our country.”\n\nIn 2023, approximately 2,000 Pennsylvania National Guard members deployed in support of ongoing contingency and force protection operations in Kuwait, the Horn of Africa, Romania and other locations.\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard also supported domestic operations, mobilizing approximately 20 personnel to assist local authorities with natural disasters.\n\nFort Indiantown Gap continued to play a major role supporting National Guard activities as the Pennsylvania National Guard’s headquarters and primary training site. The installation hosted 139,391 personnel in 2023.\n\nFort Indiantown Gap was once again the busiest National Guard training center in the country in fiscal year 2023, with 858,523 total man-days of training. Man-days are a computation of the number of personnel multiplied by the number of days they trained on post.\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard rounded out the year with the implementation of access control at Fort Indiantown Gap Nov. 1, making the installation a safer place to live, work and train.\n\nDomestic Operations\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard faced comparatively few severe weather events or civil disturbances in 2023. Guardsmen are always on duty at the Pennsylvania National Guard’s joint emergency operations center. The center maintains continuous communications with the National Guard Bureau and the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency to anticipate future requirements that could be assigned to Pennsylvania National Guard Soldiers and Airmen.\n\nIn July, the Pennsylvania National Guard mobilized 19 personnel and one helicopter in support of flooding in Pennsylvania. In September, one public affairs officer was mobilized to support the relief efforts in Hawaii following their devastating wildfires.\n\nOverseas missions\n\nIn 2023, the Pennsylvania National Guard continued to play a key role in supporting the overall U.S. military mission overseas.\n\nApproximately 20 Airmen with the 211th Engineering Installation Squadron, 193rd Regional Support Group, 193rd Special Operations Wing left Jan. 20, 2023, for a six-month deployment to the Middle East in support of U.S. Central Command.

They all stepped off with a goal to march 22 kilometers in four hours, while carrying 22 pounds in full uniform.\n\nThe 252nd CSC, a subordinate unit of the 728th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 213th Regional Support Group, deployed in June 2022 in support of Operation Spartan Shield and U.S. Central Command and returned home in April 2023.\n\nMore than 500 Soldiers with the Pennsylvania National Guard's Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 28th Infantry Division, who deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Spartan Shield in Oct. 2022 returned home in 2023.\n\nMore than 300 Soldiers with the Pennsylvania National Guard’s 2nd Battalion, 112th Infantry Regiment were honored during a deployment ceremony Dec. 17, at Zembo Shrine Auditorium in Harrisburg. A battalion under the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, these Soldiers are leaving their homes and families for a nine-month deployment to the Horn of Africa. They will serve with Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa supporting U.S. Africa Command and partner forces with security objectives in the region.\n\nTraining for Excellence\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard is constantly training to be always ready, always there in support of our Warfight abroad, domestic operations at home, and our partnerships with allies and government agencies at all levels.\n\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard’s 3rd Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team trained in preparation for an upcoming external evaluation Feb. 2 in Harrisburg.

Schumaker Public Safety Center Feb. 17.\n\nIn an effort to reduce a shortage of Stryker mechanics – military occupational specialty 91S – both in the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team and the Washington National Guard’s 81st SBCT, a new six-week course was developed that will allow current Soldiers to reclassify without going back to Advanced Individual Training.\n\nInstructors with the Pennsylvania National Guard’s 4th Battalion, 166th Regiment Regional Training Institute (Medical Battalion Training Site) sent off the Army’s newest batch of combat medics March 3, 2023. Located at Fort Indiantown Gap, the 4/166th RTI (MBTS) is one of the largest Army National Guard medical schoolhouses in the nation. Their mission is to train medical tasks to medical and non-medical personnel, with the MOS transition course being one of its primary functions. The 68W MOS Transition Course lasts 57 days and is offered three times per year. Each class starts with 48 students.\n\nMarines from the 2nd Air-Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, part of the II Marine Expeditionary Force, conducted a variety of training exercises while at Fort Indiantown Gap in April, including individual and team level training. The training included air assaults with UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade and close air support training with MQ-9 Reapers from the 111th Attack Wing and A-10 Thunderbolts from the Maryland National Guard’s 175th Fighter Wing.\n\nSeventeen Pennsylvania Army National Guard Soldiers from around the state competed in three categories at the 2023 state Best Warrior Competition April 15-19.

It was the first phase of Army Materiel Command’s Operation Patriot Press, an annual nationwide ammunition redistribution mission that supports the Army’s overall strategic positioning goals.\n\nAir crews from the 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade conducted training with specialty rescue teams May 18 as part of an extreme weather exercise. The exercise was coordinated by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and was designed to test various emergency support functions in response to a simulated hurricane.\n\nMore than 2,100 service members from several states participated in a large-scale exercise known as a Warfighter June 2 to 11 at Fort Indiantown Gap. A Warfighter is simulated exercise designed to train and evaluate Army division-sized elements on mission command in large-scale combat operations.\n\nApproximately 25 Soldiers with 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat team conducted rappel training June 13 at a rock formation near Fort Indiantown Gap known as Boxcar Rocks.\n\nFive Pennsylvania National Guard Soldiers participated in Cyber Shield, the nation’s premiere unclassified cyber training exercise.

Despite that lack of access, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard’s State Family Programs office does what they can to connect National Guard kids and families and build a community where they can support each other such as through the child and youth summer camp program. The Pennsylvania ARNG’s Child & Youth team coordinates a handful of overnight camps throughout the year but more popularly in the summer.\n\nThe commander and senior enlisted leader of the Lithuanian Air Force visited Pennsylvania where they met with Pennsylvania National Guard leaders and toured Pennsylvania National Guard facilities.
