        "text": "The 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment was in position in the assembly trenches at 4.30 a.m. on 1 July 1916. Instead of the customary tot of rum, the men were issued with pea soup, which came in large cans reeking of petrol. While they waited, they munched on the large bacon sandwiches they had been given on their way to the trenches. Zero hour was set for 7.30 a.m.\n\nThe final British artillery bombardment began at 6.25 a.m. and, over the next 65 minutes, the field guns fired 11,660 rounds of shrapnel and high explosive while the heavy guns and howitzers unleashed 7,000 shells. At about 7.00 a.m. the German guns started to reply, concentrating their firepower on the assembly trenches and causing casualties across both the 46th Division and 56th Division. Then, at 7.20 a.m. a huge mine was set off under Hawthorn Ridge, near Beaumont Hamel, leaving nobody in any doubt that the “Big Push” by the Allies was about to start.\n\nAt 7.25 a.m. the mortars began firing smoke bombs into the German lines while men in the forward trenches lobbed smoke bombs into No Man’s Land to create smoke screens. Unfortunately, two problems occurred in the section of the front held by the 46th Division. Firstly, the wind direction was unfavourable and blew the smoke along No Man’s Land, rather than across No Man’s Land and into the German trenches as it did in the sector occupied by the 56th Division. Secondly, the smoke screen shrouding the British trenches and the British barbed wire was much thicker than normal and it obscured everything. By contrast, the smoke faded more quickly in and around the enemy trenches so, once the British assault waves were through the thick smoke and out into the open they were easy targets for the German machine guns.\n\nAt 7.30 a.m. the Allies lifted the bombardment of the German front line trenches in readiness for the advance by the British infantry. On the right flank, officers from the 56th Division waved their men forward; at Gommecourt they did not use the customary whistles. On the left flank, the first wave – the 1/6th South Staffords, 1/6th North Staffords, 1/5th Sherwood Foresters and 1/7th Sherwood Foresters – began to scramble their way out of the muddy trenches. The first and second waves of the 1/6th South Staffords attacked from the old front-line trench, which was very congested; weighed down with a minimum of 66 lbs of equipment, the men found it difficult to clamber out of the trench. They then found that the gaps in the British barbed wire were too narrow and the men's uniforms and equipment caught on the barbs slowing them down still further. Because of these delays, the 1/6th South Staffords fell behind the left flank of the 1/6th North Staffords, and this resulted in a staggered formation as the 137th Infantry Brigade advanced. The men were immediately caught by machine guns firing from Gommecourt village and Gommecourt Park. Some small groups of men did manage to reach the German barbed wire, however only a few made it into the German lines where most were either killed or forced to retreat. To all intents and purposes, the attack by the 1/6th South Staffords was over in the first thirty minutes.\n\nThe right flank of the 1/6th North Staffords began their attack from the old trench, the left flank starting from the new trench; the delays on the right – caused by the problems the 1/6th South Staffs experienced getting out of the trenches and through the British barbed wire – meant the men on the left emerged through the smoke with their right flank exposed. They were caught by German machine guns firing from Gommecourt Wood and from other positions to their left; the 1/6th North Staffs – plus some bombers from the 1/5th North Staffords – were quickly cut down. Small parties did get through the German wire and into the enemy trenches but – with supporting waves of the British advance cut off by German artillery and machine gun fire – they were swiftly driven out, many men taking refuge in shells holes just outside the German barbed wire. Like the attack on their right, the advance by the 1/6th North Staffords came to a halt soon after 8:00 a.m.\n\nIn their turn, the waves of the 1/5th South Staffords all moved forward as ordered. In the second wave, A, B and F bombing parties managed to reach the German front line; they had suffered very few casualties and immediately began to throw their Mills bombs at the enemy. In the third wave, only G bombing party managed to get into the enemy front line, while from C bombing party – which did not get beyond the German barbed wire – only two men were left, the others were all struck down by shrapnel. D and E bombing parties, in the fourth wave, were also held up at the German barbed wire and retreated to a hollow 50 yards from it. In the fifth wave, the detachment from the 1/5th South Staffs were unable to move further forward when they became blocked – in the old front line – by the Lewis guns of the 1/6th South Staffords; their commanding officer decided to bypass this obstruction and took his men forward to the new front line where he found 1 officer and about 20 men from the 1/6th South Staffs; they’d been in the second wave and had been forced to retreat. The officer sent this party forward again and then advanced with his own men, plus some men from the 6th wave, until they were forced to stop – in front of the German barbed wire – because of the number of casualties there.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after zero hour, the communication trenches were bombarded with 105 mm high explosive shells; the trenches were damaged and the 6th and 7th waves sustained several casualties which hampered their advance. The left platoon of the 6th wave was prevented from advancing any further - blocked by men from the 3rd and 4th waves of the 1/6th South Staffs still in the new front line – and there they stayed for the remainder of the operation. Led by Captain Ferdinand Eglington, the seventh wave detachment from the 1/5th South Staffords advanced beyond the new front line until Captain Eglington was killed 20 yards from the German barbed wire; his men were unable to make any further progress. The eighth wave, in their turn, were unable to advance beyond the old British front line.\n\nBy 8.00 a.m. the attack by the 137th Brigade was at a standstill and desperate messages were being sent up and down the mud-filled, casualty-strewn communication trenches as officers desperately tried to reorganise the survivors in the hope of making a new advance. By 8.30 a.m. the men who had been able to crawl back from the German barbed wire had sought refuge in the shell holes and long grass of No Man’s Land or were now huddled in the muddy advanced trench. By then the attack by the 46th Division was all but over.\n\nBy 9.30 a.m. the Germans of the 91st Regiment and 55th Reserve Infantry Regiment were reporting that their trenches had been cleared of those few men that had made it into the enemy lines. Accordingly, the German artillery switched their attention to the assault by the 56th Division. 46th Division Headquarters announced that the 46th would renew its attack at 12.15 p.m. but, realistically, the chaos in their ranks meant there was never any prospect of that happening. Times for that resumption were declared and then postponed throughout the early afternoon but, eventually, 46th Division Headquarters issued orders that the attack would recommence at 3.30 p.m. Their plan was for a group of men – drawn from the 1/5th North Staffords, 1/5th South Staffords, 1/5th Leicesters and 1/6th Sherwood Foresters – to advance under a new smoke screen and join up with men from the 139th Brigade who were thought to be still in the German lines and continuing to fight there; in fact, these men had all been killed, captured or driven back a lot earlier in the day. The Brigadier commanding the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters told his men not to attack unless there was a smoke screen and, when that failed to materialise, most of his men stayed in the trenches; however, a group of about 20 did advance and, almost to a man, were cut down by machine gun fire.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Colonel Robert Richmond Rayner – the officer commanding the 1/5th South Staffords – was wounded, that left no one to issue the order to resume the attack; the two young subalterns present were both aged 18 and had never seen the trenches or been in action before that day. Generally, there was chaos within the 137th Infantry Brigade; it was clear to most of the officers that any resumption of the attack would be a shambles. In the event, not a man of the 137th Brigade moved; their part in the attack on Gommecourt was effectively over.\n\nThe abortive assault that day was a costly one for the 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment. Aside from the death of Captain Ferdinand Eglington, Lieutenant Gavin Tennison Royle Knowles was reported missing, believed killed in action; his death was subsequently confirmed, as were the deaths of five other officers, all reported missing on that day: 2nd Lieutenant Herbert Allen, 2nd Lieutenant Stanley John Ellison, 2nd Lieutenant Frank Aldridge Fawcett, 2nd Lieutenant Thomas Rudolf Sanger and Lieutenant John Parry Thorne. Nine more officers were wounded, two of them suffering from shell shock. In addition, 12 men from the ranks were reported to have been killed and 13 more were missing; 1 was wounded and missing, 105 were wounded and 20 more were suffering from shell shock. Records show that the following men from the ranks were all killed in action on 1 July 1916 during the attack on Gommecourt:\n\nPicture 70\n\nAt about 3 o’clock in the afternoon of 1 July, the 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment received telephone orders to proceed to the trenches in support of the 1/5th North Staffs. The Battalion moved up via Absolem Trench, the leading half reaching the designated position in Abode Trench. However, the troops at the rear were held up by a heavy enemy barrage targeted at the Absolem and Agnes communication trenches; they could not move up until 10.30 p.m. and then only by half-platoons at intervals of 50 paces. When Lieutenant Colonel James Lamond – the Officer Commanding the 1/5th South Staffs – took charge of the sector at 5.30 p.m. he was told that two companies of the 1/5th North Staffs were surrounded in Aconite Trench and the remainder of the 1/5th North Staffs and 1/6th North Staffs were back in Ague Trench. The 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades had also been unable to make forward progress on the Battalion’s flanks.\n\nWhen he had verified the situation – to the extent that was possible – Lieutenant Colonel Lamond issued fresh orders for an attack. The intention was for the first two waves to reach the 1/5th North Staffs in Aconite Trench and secure that objective; the troops in the third wave were to act as moppers up, clearing the houses in the sector, with the 9th Hussars and 18th Lancers – in reserve – occupying Ague Trench. In the meantime, the 137th Infantry Brigade had also issued orders instructing the Battalion to launch an attack at 10 p.m. but these directives were not received until 6 minutes before that time, so the Brigadier – by telephone – delayed the assault by an hour; he also agreed Lamond’s plans for the attack. Lamond’s orders were issued at 10.05 p.m., and were sent out officer to officer, but – in the confusion – they took some time to reach the men at the front of the attack, 11.10 p.m. for the right flank, 11.25 p.m. for those on the left.\n\nThe leading half platoon of the Company on the right flank reached Ague Trench shortly after Lamond’s orders had been received; they then tried to make contact with the 138th Infantry Brigade on the Battalion’s right flank some 200 yards to the south. As they arrived, the remainder of that Company extended their line to the left, the last group reaching Ague Trench at about 11.50 p.m. Realising, through reconnoitring, that they were 200 yards from their target, the Company Commander began moving his men into the correct position and this took until 12.15 a.m. on 2 July. Meanwhile, the Company on the left – which was supposed to be making its way up Adroit Trench to Ague Trench – was misled by their guide into the wrong trench; they were finally led to the correct position at 12.05 a.m. by their Company Commander and it was not until after 12.15 a.m. that the junction between the two companies was established. However, neither company was able to establish contact with the units on their flanks, the 138th Infantry Brigade on the right, the 139th Infantry Brigade on the left. The Company Commander on the right flank sent out a patrol at about 12.10 a.m. to locate the 4th Dragoon Guards, who were supposed to be moving up roads that had been allocated to them, but nothing was seen of them all night.\n\nHaving been in position since 2 p.m., the 3rd wave – men from the 1/6th North Staffs – began to move forward, as ordered, at zero hour (midnight). Shortly afterwards, the Company Commanders at the front – hearing no bombing, rifle or machine gun fire, and seeing no signs that other men were advancing, the 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades in particular – decided in consultation at 12.20 a.m. not to attack.\n\nAfter he’d debriefed the Company Commanders, Lieutenant Colonel Lamond – in his report of 4 July to the 137th Infantry Brigade – gave reasons why his operational orders had not been carried out. He accepted that there had been considerable difficulty in getting the men to their designated positions prior to the attack and that the inexperience of junior officers had played a part in this. Lamond explained that the attack he had planned was not dependent on the support of the 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades, but the Company Officers had not appreciated this. In the debrief he had told the Company Officers that they should have informed headquarters – at once – that they felt the attack was inadvisable. They should have also made a special effort to locate the 4th Dragoon Guards and guide them into position; had they done so then the attack could have gone ahead as planned. Lamond acknowledged that the Company Officers had endeavoured to report to the senior officer in the trenches, Major Evans of the 1/6th South Staffs, but he had been withdrawn so they were not able to advise him of their opinion that the attack should not go ahead. Later, at 1.00 a.m. on 2 July they had been informed – by a cavalry officer in the headquarters previously occupied by Major Evans – that the 4th Dragoon Guards had withdrawn. By way of mitigation for the Company Officers’ decision, Lamond said that at zero hour (midnight) he had been outside his Headquarters listening for sounds to indicate that the attack had begun, but he too had heard nothing to suggest that it was taking place across the whole of the Battalion front. Lamond maintained that the delay in transmitting his orders was unavoidable, that signallers had been out constantly that night trying to repair the telephone wires. He had been forced to rely on runners who frequently lost their way on the shell torn ground and, on average, took an hour to deliver his orders. Lamond had sent 12 trained bombers from the 1/6th North Staffs to the 4th Dragoon Guards but these had also lost their way and had not arrived until 2.30 a.m. on 2 July. He said the 4th Dragoon Guards had failed to supply him with a report indicating whether they had been in the correct position at the designated time. Lamond acknowledged that his men were exhausted after all they had been through in the days leading up to this assault; however, he was confident they would have given their best if the attack had been carried out as planned.\n\nThis attack may have been abandoned but it was not without its casualties. 32903 Private Henry Beardall and 841/201341 Lance Corporal Thomas Ryan, both of D Company, were killed in the action on 1 July; 977/201413 Private Frank Henry, who was reported missing at the time, was also killed in action that day. One officer and eleven men from the ranks were wounded. 766/201300 Private Henry Hopson – who had been wounded on 28 June – also died of his wounds on 1 July. A further six men were wounded on 2 July as the Battalion was relieved by the 22nd Battalion (French Canadian) Canadian Expeditionary Force; three men were also reported missing but they all survived. The following day, the 1/5th South Staffs moved into Divisional rest billets at Burbure, 20 miles north west of Liévin, where they spent the next three weeks training. On 14 July, 9649/200786 Private Benjamin Perry, 200335 Corporal Ernest Picken and 9855/200883 Private Adam Priest were decorated with the Military Medal by the Third Army Commander, General Sir Julian Byng. On 25 July the Battalion moved into the Divisional Reserve at Fouquières-lés-Béthune, north-west of Lens, where their training continued until 2 August. They then relieved the 1/5th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment in the 137th Infantry Brigade Reserve at Mazingarbe, 7 miles north west of Lens, where their training continued until 7 August; every night they supplied parties to carry ammunition up to the 137th Infantry Brigade Trench Mortar Battery.\n\nOn 8 August, the 1/5th South Staffs went back into the line, relieving the 1/6th South Staffs in the trenches south of Hulluch. Early impressions suggested the enemy was nervous and on the defensive, and the enemy artillery was generally quiet except when it responded to Canadian bombardment. German soldiers reduced their visibility in the front line after Battalion snipers scored some initial successes and, on 10 August, 2nd Lieutenant Frank Grove Fernyhough led a patrol which got into one of the enemy trenches where they killed six German soldiers before returning without suffering casualties. After a brief spell in Brigade Support, the 1/5th returned to the front line on 14 August in preparation for the Canadian attack on Hill 70 that was to take place the next day. Battalion casualties for the first two weeks of August were 8 men wounded.\n\n{Things were not going well for the Allies as the war dragged on into the summer of 1917. Widespread mutinies had undermined the efforts of the French army and the revolution in Russia had fundamentally changed the dynamics on the Eastern Front. The major Allied offensive at Passchendaele was bogged down in the mud of Belgium and, at sea, the German u-boat campaign was strangling the flow of the vital supplies Britain needed to continue fighting. The United States had recently entered the war, but it would be some time before its troops were ready to join the battle. Meanwhile, men had come to Britain’s aid from all over the Empire, not least from the province of Canada.\n\nIn April 1917, Canadian troops had scored a significant victory for the Allies at Vimy Ridge. Shortly after, the British commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng, was promoted to General Officer Commanding the Third Army and Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie (who had played an important role in the planning and direction of the battle at Vimy Ridge) was named commander of the Canadian Corps, the first time a Canadian had been given that honour. His first major action was the Canadian attack at Hill 70, the high ground north west of Lens; it was hoped that this would force the German command to pull troops away from the heavy fighting around Passchendaele, weakening their position there.\n\nPicture 71\n\nThe Allied Commander, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, wanted Lieutenant-General Currie to attack the coal mining town of Lens, a few miles to the north of Vimy Ridge. The war had reduced large parts of Lens to a maze of ruined buildings and these provided the enemy with well-camouflaged defensive positions. The Germans also had full control of the high ground surrounding half the city. Currie surveyed the area extensively and concluded that it would be difficult for his artillery to destroy the German defences in Lens. Because the Canadians would be in the open, and the Germans would have them in their sites, a direct troop assault on the town would therefore result in a huge number of Allied casualties, and would make taking the city very difficult, let alone holding it.\n\nCurrie persuaded Haig that the nearby high ground – to the north of and overlooking the city – would need to be taken before Lens itself could be attacked. The area, Hill 70, was so named because it rose 70 metres above sea level. Currie’s plan was to take its slopes with a surprise assault and then to quickly set up Canadian defences on the high ground; these would hold back the enemy counterattacks the Germans were bound to launch as they would not want the strategically-located Hill 70 to remain for long in Allied hands.\n\nAllied artillery softened up the German positions in the area and trench raids were launched south of Lens to mislead the enemy regarding the focus of the main attack. The offensive was launched on 15 August 1917 and the Canadians rapidly seized most of their objectives on the slopes of Hill 70. Taken by surprise, the Germans reacted as expected, making 21 counterattacks over the days that followed. The result was carnage as the Germans advanced again and again into the hail of bullets from around 250 Canadian machine guns. The fighting at Hill 70 was remarkably brutal even for the most battle-hardened soldiers. Poison gas was used extensively, forcing the men to gasp for air inside their respirators while they struggled to see enemy attacks through their fogged-up goggles. There was desperate hand-to-hand fighting to repel those German assaults that did get through to the Canadian defences, but Hill 70 remained stubbornly in Canadian hands despite the ferocity of the German counterattacks.\n\nHowever, the Germans still held Lens itself and the Allies began to sweep the town with fire from the heights they now commanded to the north. The Canadians went on the offensive on 21 August, and again on 23 August, launching attacks on the town itself. As Currie had anticipated, the exposed Canadian troops suffered significant casualties from the heavy fire of the German defenders. They did manage to capture the western portion of Lens, but the Canadian attacks then petered out in the face of stiff enemy resistance. The Battles for Hill 70 and Lens came to an end on 25 August; although the Canadians had not achieved all of their goals, they had brought the Allies another remarkable success. The Canadian soldiers displayed enormous courage and six of their number were awarded the Victoria Cross, 3 posthumously. However, the fighting took a devastating toll: the 100,000-strong Canadian Corps suffered 9,200 casualties in the period 15–25 August and it is thought that the enemy was hit even harder, as many as 25,000 Germans soldiers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner during this period.}\n\nWith the 46th (North Midland) Division on their left, the Canadians launched their attack on Hill 70 at 4.25 a.m. on 15 August and the first enemy counterattack came six hours later. By 11.30 a.m. a dozen waves of the German 4th Guards Infantry Division were moving diagonally in front of the British 137th Infantry Brigade, heading towards Hill 70. They maintained admirable order and were directed by a German officer riding a grey horse. The Allied artillery seemed to have little impact on the enemy advance, the enemy troops not faltering despite the losses they sustained. At 1700 yards, the machine guns of the 137th Infantry Brigade came into play and – at closer range – the Battalion’s rifles and Lewis guns were also able to target the German advance, though to little effect. As the Germans approached the Canadian lines, they came under heavy rifle and machine gun fire from the higher ground on Hill 70 and the trenches that had been captured in the early hours. Having reached them, the closest trenches now became the front line for what remained of the 4th Guards Infantry Division.\n\nAt 12.30 p.m., C Company was withdrawn from the Battalion’s right front trenches to enable the British artillery to shell the German trenches that were close by. When C Company went to return in the afternoon, reports suggested that 2 or 3 German stragglers were in their trench. 2nd Lieutenant Reginald Briars and a couple of orderlies moved along the trench to see if this was true; in a dugout, they came upon – and shot – two soldiers from the German 5th Guard Regiment of Foot, a private and a Sergeant Major. Although the Battalion was not directly involved in the fighting for Hill 70, 4 officers and 11 men from the 1/5th South Staffs were wounded on 15 August. Two men from the ranks and one officer were also killed in that day’s action – 16/200957 Corporal William Butler, 242149 Private Walter Elliott Skevington and 2nd Lieutenant Harold Swindells, who had received his commission on 28 March 1917; he had landed in France on 19 June and had joined up with the Battalion on 2 July, just six weeks before the assault on Hill 70.\n\nThe weather was fine all day on 16 August and the Battalion trenches came under shellfire as the Germans again counterattacked the Canadian positions on Hill 70. The German walking wounded could be seen limping away from the fighting and, although they had been working throughout the night, enemy ambulances continued moving backwards and forwards during the daylight hours, carrying away the wounded. The Allied artillery did not interfere with this gruesome task. Apart from some aeroplane activity, 17 August passed quietly. The Battalion was relieved that evening by the 1/6th South Staffs. At 11.45 p.m., just as the relief had been completed, the Canadians sent up an S.O.S. and the artillery on both sides began firing once more. Again, the fighting was concentrated on the Canadian defences on Hill 70, though it was thought – at first – that the front line of the 137th Infantry Brigade was also involved. The artillery fire gradually quietened down, and the Battalion was informed that another German counterattack had been repulsed. Two men from the Battalion were wounded on 17 August, three more had been injured the day before.\n\nThe next three days were spent in the Brigade Reserve at Marzingarbe, 7 miles north west of Lens. At night, working parties carried poison gas cylinders from Vendin Dump up to the front line, a distance of more than a mile, along trenches made muddy by the rain. Each cylinder contained 60 pounds of gas and required two men to carry it; the men did two journeys each night. These working parties left camp at 9 p.m. each night and were not able to return until 6 a.m. the next morning.\n\nOn 21 August, the Battalion again relieved the 1/6th South Staffs in the Hulluch Sector. During this relief, nine men from A Company were gassed as they moved up to the front. This tour lasted until the evening of 25 August and, every night, small Battalion patrols tried to enter the German front line trenches, but the nervous enemy sentries were alert to this threat. Buoyed by the Canadian successes on Hill 70, the officers, NCOs and men of the 1/5th South Staffs were keen to raid the enemy trenches. To this end, the British artillery tried to break the German barbed wire at the point where the Battalion intended to penetrate the enemy defences, but their efforts were not successful. Several men were gassed during this tour and nine men were wounded. 8887/200451 Corporal Frederick Arthur Baldwin was killed in action on 23 August and, two days later, five more men lost their lives: 9126/200576 Private Oliver Davies, 9698/200810 Acting Corporal Joseph Hughes, 33054 Private John William Kirk, 1312/201601 Private Arthur Rogers and 8024/20135/235028 Sergeant Harold Skinner.\n\nThe Battalion spent 26 August in Brigade Reserve finalising the details for a double raid. The 1/6th South Staffs were to raid first, then – using the same penetration point – Captain Harold Alfred Ivatt, M.C. was to lead the Battalion’s raiding party, which was to be drawn from A Company and B Company. However, it rained intermittently all the next day, the intended day for the raid, and patrols from both the 1/5th and 1/6th South Staffs reported that the barbed wire had not been cut sufficiently so the raid was postponed for 24 hours. On 28 August, the heavy artillery was given the task of severing the barbed wire. At 6 o’clock that evening, reports were received saying the wire had now been cut sufficiently and 137th Infantry Brigade Headquarters gave the order for the raid to go ahead.\n\nAt 8 p.m. – when there was still some daylight – five officers and one hundred other men from the ranks of the 1/6th South Staffs rushed the German trenches. By 9 p.m. they had withdrawn, having reached their objective with ease and having sustained only a few casualties; they returned with 5 prisoners from the 3rd Battalion 393rd German Infantry Regiment. Somewhat surprisingly, the prisoners seemed pleased to have been captured and one provided the location of the dugout occupied by their company commander; this was shelled during the second raid which began at 1 a.m. on 29 August. Captain Ivatt’s raiders – 7 officers and 104 from the ranks, plus 4 men from the 137th Infantry Brigade Trench Mortar Battery – had been divided into six groups. These moved forward as the Allied artillery barrage of the German lines lifted from trench to trench to create a horse-shoe shape that provided a measure of protection for the raiders. The 1/6th South Staffs had done such a good job in the first raid that Captain Ivatt’s men met with little opposition. A few enemy soldiers were encountered by one group but these were driven back up the German front-line trench using bombs and a Lewis gun. A second group came up against dogged and determined resistance from a solitary German soldier. The raiders withdrew by 2.10 a.m., having ensured that the enemy had abandoned their trenches and dugouts. Two officers and sixteen men from the ranks were wounded, mainly by enemy machine gun fire as it traversed the Battalion parapet. Two men were killed: 9115/200569 Sergeant John Samuel Halling and 8392/200262 Acting Corporal Charles Thomas Warman; on 12 April 1917, Sergeant Halling had been awarded the Military Medal for the bravery he had shown in a previous action. One man – 9001/200513 Private John Cunningham – was reported missing at the time and it was later confirmed that he also died that day.\n\nTwo men were killed in action on 30 August: 4033/202975 Private Alfred Walters and 200184 Corporal John Ward. A third man was wounded the same day. In readiness for the winter, adjustments were made to the section of the front occupied by the 137th Infantry Brigade, and the Battalion received campaign orders to relieve the 1/6th North Staffs in the Hulluch sector. The relief was completed by 11.15 p.m. the next day.\n\nOn its first full day in the sub-sector, 1 September, the Battalion was informed about possible enemy mining in that area. To investigate this rumour, 2nd Lieutenant William Norman Clifton Clark and an NCO slipped out in daylight to examine the crater system between the two front lines, with a view to patrolling them after dark. They found footprints but no enemy troops and no evidence of mining in either of the two southern craters. After dark, 2nd Lieutenant Clark led a patrol to investigate further, in particular to check the northern crater. This time the southern craters were occupied, and the enemy sentries were on alert, so the patrol was forced to withdraw. At 11 p.m. the Battalion operator of the listening apparatus reported that the enemy had been taking great care to check their telephones; later, they had also synchronised their watches. The information that an attack was coming was relayed at once to Brigade Headquarters. Next morning, 2 September, when the Germans attacked the Brigade to the north of the 1/5th South Staffs, they found the men alert and ready, with the result that the British took one prisoner and sustained no casualties in the encounter. Following up 2nd Lieutenant Clark’s hunch that the Germans might be occupying them after dark, a small patrol got into the craters during daylight and lay in wait for German troops to arrive, but by 10.30 p.m. none had appeared. After two fine days in the trenches, and having suffered no further casualties, the Battalion was relieved that night and went into Brigade Reserve at Verquin. They stayed there until 9 September and, in the glorious weather, the programme of platoon, company and Battalion training was supplemented with football matches, boxing bouts and even a cricket match between the officers and the sergeants, which the latter won by 24 runs. Early on the morning of 5 September, the enemy released a large cloud of gas along the 46th Division front, but this had little effect on the Battalion’s positive mood at Verquin.\n\nPicture 72\n\nOn 10 September, the Battalion moved to Brigade Support in Mazingarbe where the training and physical exercise continued. On 12 September, A Company and B Company practised “trench to trench attack”: as the men going into battle always expected the artillery to have achieved more than was realistic by way of creating breaks in the barbed wire, this exercise included negotiating uncut wire. C Company and D Company went through the same practice the following day.\n\n{The hand-carried explosive device used to destroy enemy barbed wire entanglements was known to the soldiers as an “ammonal tube” or “Bangalore Torpedo”. They measured about two and a half inches in diameter and varied in length depending on the depth of the barbed wire that had to be severed. A pointed wooden end was inserted in the front of the tube and the ammonal – a mixture of ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder – was then added. A flat plug was inserted in the rear end and a fuse was pushed through its pre-drilled hole; the fuse was then ignited, causing the ammonal to explode.}\n\nThis period in Brigade Reserve – which ended during the evening of 14 September when the Battalion moved back into the front line at Hulluch – was notable for a freak accident to 20043/203337 Private Horace Hirst of C Company who was injured in the arm by a bullet that fell from the sky during an exchange of machine gunfire in an aerial dogfight between an allied aircraft and two enemy aeroplanes; at the time, the unfortunate Private Hirst had been diligently cleaning his mess tin by the canteen. Sadly, Private Hirst died later in the war, killed in action on 29 April 1918.\n\nThe Battalion spent the remainder of the month rotating between the front-line trenches at Hulluch, Brigade Support at Mazingarbe and Brigade Reserve at Verquin. During the whole of September there were only 3 casualties, and these were slight. The Battalion did a good deal of work putting the trenches into a better state of repair in preparation for the coming winter but the attempts of patrols to capture German soldiers were frustrated by uncut wire, the alertness of the German sentries, and the reluctance of the enemy to venture beyond their own barbed wire. On 29 September, 33 other ranks joined the Battalion and were distributed between the companies; the majority of these were 19-year old lads experiencing the Western Front for the first time. Even with these additions, the Battalion was still short of numbers.\n\nThe pattern of rotations continued on into October. During the night of 2/3 October, the Battalion sent out three patrols to find and penetrate the numerous gaps in the barbed wire that the 1/5th North Staffs had made with 14 ammonal tubes; however, they were unable to find any, so efficient was German organisation when it came to repair of their own wire. During the evening of 4 October, the Germans made a determined attack on Cité St Auguste and the left side of Hill 70 but the 6th Infantry Division managed to resist this assault. That night the British sent up a huge poison gas cloud along the fronts of the 46th and 2nd Infantry Divisions. Apart from the Lewis gunners, all the infantry was withdrawn from the front line during this operation. For a short time, the men in the Reserve line stood on the fire steps in the trenches admiring the high gas cloud which could be seen clearly in the bright moonlight, then the Germans exploded white star shells over the scene and traversed the British trenches with machine gun fire. On 6 October, Australian tunnellers reported that they could hear work going on in the southern crater; a patrol led by 2nd Lieutenant George Webb dashed forward under a barrage of 2-inch trench and Stokes mortar shells. They did not find the enemy, or any sign of work in the crater, but they did discover the body of a Cameron Highlander near the surface of the crater; it was decomposed beyond recognition and was incapable of being removed, so they covered it reverently, as best they could, until such time as his final resting place could be marked in safety.\n\nDuring the evening of 11 October, after a brief spell in Brigade Support, the Battalion moved to the front line in the right Hulluch subsector, occupying the trenches from Chalk Pit Alley to Vendin Alley. The trenches were very wet and slippery and, next day, the men worked hard in the heavy rain to prevent things getting worse. As the 1/5th South Staffs War Diary pointed out, being on a quiet front provided opportunities for training – especially for the inexperienced young officers who had just joined the Battalion – and for preparing the new recruits for the more intensive warfare they would face in the future.\n\nA night patrol on 14/15 October discovered the body of a soldier from the 393rd German Infantry Regiment; his body should have been recovered weeks before as he was carrying letters dated 28 July that had never been posted home. The following night, when the Battalion returned to Brigade Reserve in Verquin, special precautions were taken to protect the men’s feet from the cold rain and the poor state of the trenches. There were no casualties during this brief tour, however twelve men did report sick on 16 October, though none needed hospital treatment. That day, which was primarily spent cleaning and bathing, saw the Battalion’s first game in the football league organised amongst the units of the 46th Division; the match against the Royal Engineers 466th Field Company ended in a 2 – 2 draw. The following evening, with the permission of the Town Mayor, the Battalion held boxing contests in Whizz Bang Hall; these were well contested and were followed by a short concert.\n\nAt 5 p.m. on 18 October, the Battalion took over the tunnels in the Hulluch left subsector; having not suffered from the recent rain, these trenches were in good condition. Four patrols went out that night and managed to get beyond the German barbed wire, but they did not take any prisoners, a frustration that was to recur throughout this tour.\n\nOn 20 October, Captain Simpson, of the American 34th Regiment, arrived at Battalion Headquarters. {The first U.S. infantry troops had landed in France on 26 June 1917. However, the “Doughboys” – as the British referred to them – were untrained and ill-equipped, far from ready to take part in the fighting on the Western Front. The commander of the U.S. Expeditionary Force, General John J. Pershing, set up training camps in France and established communication and supply networks. The first American troops went into combat on 21 October – 18 weeks after they had landed in France – deployed alongside French soldiers in the trenches of the Lunéville sector near Nancy in France.} Captain Simpson was an aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, the Commander of the American 33rd Division. Two months earlier he had been on the US border, fighting with the American army against the Mexican revolutionary forces led by Pancho Villa. Captain Simpson spent the day observing a very different form of warfare, learning first-hand about life in the trenches. The Battalion found their visitor extremely informative, especially regarding America’s conscription of a new army corps to bolster the Allied forces on the Western Front.\n\nThat night of 20/21 October, a patrol of 2 officers and 15 men from the ranks got into the enemy’s front-line trench but they were unable to take advantage of their position. Further south, 224/201038 Sergeant Richard Hartshorne was killed when a second patrol could not find a gap in the German wire. The Battalion spent the next 4 days in Brigade Support at Mazingarbe, those men who needed it being vaccinated against enteric (typhoid) fever. During the afternoon of 24 October, the 1/5th South Staffs played their second football league match, this time drawing 1 – 1 against the 1st Monmouths; they considered this a good result as the 1st Monmouths had already played 5 times, winning four times and drawing once.\n\nThe following evening, the Battalion returned to the Hulluch left subsector. Once again regular patrols went out across No Man’s Land but – apart from discovering that the Germans had set up a row of dummies in their front line – only one group encountered a German patrol; there was a brief exchange of bombs and gunfire, and 2nd Lieutenant John Henry Hoare was wounded in the foot, the Germans then retired quickly to their own lines. Out of the blue, the enemy shelled the Quarry during the afternoon of 29 October; one of the six shells landed as a group of men were going to fetch their dinner; two men were killed – 202226 Private Joseph Norman Butler and 30120 Private Charles Henry Wilkes – and 4 others were wounded, though not seriously. This tour ended on 30 October and during it a lot of work went into improving the state of the trenches in readiness for a planned raid by the 1/6th North Staffs. The men of the Battalion were given tea at Mazingarbe on their way back to Brigade Reserve, and porridge and rum when they reached Verquin.\n\nOn 1 November, the 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment formed up in a hollow square and the Divisional Commander, Major General William Thwaites, presented the Military Cross to 2 soldiers from the 46th Division; 14 men received the Military Medal. Among the recipients was 8562/141468/200317 Lance Corporal Frank S Bailey from the 1/5th South Staffs; his citation read “During operations south-west of Lens on 28 June 1917, the NCO in charge of his Lewis Gun team was killed and Lance Corporal Bailey (then a Private) took command at once and led the team forward to the final objective. He established a post and, when attacked by a large party of the enemy, drove them off with the Lewis Gun and consolidated the post.”\n\nAfter the presentations, Major General Thwaites described the 1/6th North Staffs raid that had taken place the previous afternoon. Four minutes before zero hour, a dummy raid was made 100 yards to the north of the main attack and this drew the whole of the German artillery; those trenches had been filled with dummies and “only 20 of these inanimate heroes were left alive”. At 4.30 p.m. the 1/6th North Staffs went over the top on a 350-yard front 4 companies deep; they occupied the enemy’s first, second and third trenches and met no retaliation or machine gunfire. They estimated that they killed over 100 German troops; these had been occupying dugouts in the front line covered over with iron sheeting or sacking; they also took 48 prisoners. The raiders from the 1/6th North Staffs remained there for 40 minutes then returned with their prisoners. They were all back by 5.30 p.m. and, although 11 men were injured, their wounds were not serious. Major General Thwaites described it as “a devilish good raid, well planned and well carried out”.\n\nAfter the parade, the 1/5th South Staffs beat the 1/4th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment 4 – 0 in their third football match in the 46th Division league. The following evening, the men were entertained to boxing bouts and a concert, but 24 hours later the Battalion found itself back in the trenches of the Hulluch left subsector. On 4 November, 2nd Lieutenant Lester of the American Infantry joined D Company on a 3-day attachment. He was eager to gain experience and was interested to learn that the machine-gun bullets flying over his head were at least 50 yards above him; when they came down to body level, he learned his first lesson in practical warfare: how to jump into the nearest trench. That evening, a patrol led by 2nd Lieutenant George Lancelot Lamb got into the enemy front line; no Germans were found but a store of hand grenades was discovered and detonated.\n\nOn 5 November, listening apparatus picked up coded German conversations that suggested the enemy was planning a trench mortar bombardment; forewarned, the British artillery prepared to respond should the enemy begin shelling. At five minutes past ten that night, the British fired one hundred and fifty 30-lb poison gas shells at enemy positions in Hulluch and Cité St. Elie. The Gas Officer estimated that the barrage would kill 30 enemy troops and inflict about 200 casualties. At the same time, to the left of the Battalion, 3 officers and 80 men from the 1/4th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment left their assembly positions in No Man’s Land and rushed the enemy front line, killing a few German troops and capturing 2 others. However, the officers in command of the German line had just been carried away, wounded in the opening barrage. The enemy was now fully aware of the raid, and was ready to retaliate, so the 1/4th Lincolnshire abandoned their original intention to press forward into the 2nd and 3rd German lines.\n\nGood news began to filter through from a number of fronts: French success on the Aisne, British success in Gaza, and most especially the Allied capture of Passchendaele. However, suggestions at home that the war could be over by Christmas were tempered with news of a significant setback, the Germans and Austrians taking over 180,000 prisoners and pushing the Italians back to their own border. Meanwhile, with German connivance, Lenin had seized power in Russia; his government’s decision to sue for peace allowed German troops to be withdrawn from the East to bolster the enemy’s hard-pressed forces on the Western Front, and this prolonged the war.\n\nAfter another spell in Brigade Support at Mazingarbe, the 1/5th South Staffs returned to the Hulluch right subsector during the evening of 11 November. That night, three patrols went out; the first patrol was uneventful but the second made an unsuccessful attack on a German outpost and had 6 men wounded, one seriously. The third patrol, led by 2nd Lieutenant Leslie Frederick Burton, located another German outpost, and the following night he and 2nd Lieutenant Charles Lindop assembled in No Man’s Land with 28 other ranks; at 8.45 p.m. Lindop and 2 Lewis guns seized a crater and opened fire on the enemy’s front and second line. At the same time, Burton and 10 men made for the German outpost; they had some difficulty getting through the barbed wire but, once through, Burton fired at and wounded 2 German soldiers who quickly ran off; Burton and his men then jumped down into the outpost where they found and killed a third German. The party collected his papers: he was 35 years old, had a poor physique and was from the 215th Prussian Infantry Regiment which had previously seen service on the Eastern Front. The patrol – which had suffered no casualties – then withdrew to their own lines.\n\n202758 Private Robert Leighton of A Company was killed in action on 12 November. Both sides shelled the opposition front lines over the next two days, then, at 10.40 p.m. on 14 November, the Allies projected another 700 gas cylinders at enemy positions in Hulluch and Cité St. Elie. 8956/200481 Private Frank Coleman was killed in action that day. The Battalion was relieved the following evening and went into Brigade Reserve at Verquin, where they were joined by a draft of 48 reinforcements. The day after, the Battalion drew 2 – 2 in their next football match, their opponents, the 1/6th South Staffs, coming back from 2 – 1 down at half time to snatch a draw in the last 10 minutes. Bathing and equipment inspections occupied the next two days, but training was limited as the range was being rebuilt. On 17 November, an evening of boxing matches was followed by a concert, during which 8201/200198 Drummer George Getley recited the poem “Gommecourt Wood” that he had written about the action of the Staffords on 1 July 1916. {Drummer Getley was born in 1896 and lived in Bridgtown, Cannock. He joined up in March 1913 and went to France in March 1915. He served with the 1/5th South Staffords throughout the war, which he survived.}\n\nThe following day, the Battalion beat the Army Service Corps 2 – 1 in their next match in the 46th Division football league. On 19 November, the 1/5th South Staffs moved up once more to the front-line trenches in the Hulluch left subsector. The commander of the 46th Division, Major General William Thwaites, visited Battalion Headquarters on 20 November and commended the good bearing of the men. Night patrols went out again, but they found little of any significance to report, other than that they had entered the enemy front line and found it abandoned.\n\nPicture 75\n\nBy November 30th, the Germans had regrouped and were ready to mount a counter-attack to defend Cambrai. When it came, their response was extremely effective and by the end of the operation the Germans had recaptured much of the ground that had been lost in the early days of the battle, so much so that, on 3 December, Haig ordered the withdrawal of those British units that were still near Cambrai.\n\nThe Third Army reported losses of dead, wounded and missing of 44,207 between 20 November and 8 December. Of these, about 6,000 were taken prisoner in the enemy counter-attack on 30 November. Enemy casualties were estimated at approximately 45,000. However, by the end of the operation the tank had demonstrated its potential and the Allies had shown that the Hindenburg Line was not impregnable.}\n\nThe Battalion was relieved on 23 November and spent a brief spell in Brigade Support at Noyelles-lès-Vermelles where four officers joined as reinforcements. It was bitterly cold and there was a shortage of fuel. What with the rain, wind and cold – and the doctor giving inoculations against enteric (typhoid) – training was limited. On 27 November, the predicted rain failed to materialise as the men made their way back up to the trenches in the Hulluch right subsector, where the unoccupied sections were targeted early the following morning by the enemy’s “flying pigs” (heavy trench mortars). At 10.30 p.m. that night, the Royal Engineers – on the left – fired 830 gas bombs at Hulluch and Cité St. Elie, while the 11th Division discharged 500 more on the right; this provoked some artillery, trench mortar and machine gun fire from the enemy. At the same time, a patrol led by 2nd Lieutenant Leslie Frederick Burton tried to get through the enemy barbed wire, but it was too thick at that point; they had hoped the Royal Artillery bombardment would cut the wire sufficiently to allow them to proceed beyond it. Nevertheless, the patrol was able to establish that the enemy front line was unoccupied. A second patrol, led by 2nd Lieutenant George Lancelot Lamb, delayed their approach to a second section of the wire and were spotted as they clambered out of the front line; 6202/200015 Sergeant Alfred Edge was shot in the shoulder and, as he helped the sergeant back to the Battalion’s lines, 2nd Lieutenant Lamb was wounded in the thigh, though not seriously; 3139/240658 Private Joseph Edward Cox and 1211/201546 Private James Yates were also wounded and all four men were sent for hospital treatment; these setbacks put an end to that patrol’s work for the night. Sadly, Private Yates died of his wounds the next day; the War Diary describes him as “a most brave and good soldier, one of the keenest patrollers the Battalion had, the first to volunteer in any weather or conditions”; news of his death was received with great regret by his officers.\n\nOn the final day of November 1917, a night patrol of 25 men and 2 officers attacked an enemy post near Posen Crater. 2nd Lieutenant Reginald Frank Compton Dare and 6 men managed to get into the post, but they were driven back by heavy enemy bombing. 2nd Lieutenant Dare and three men were wounded; the death of 10582 Private Samuel Wilkinson – who was reported wounded and missing – was confirmed the following day; 18684 Private Alfred William Bayliss, who was also reported missing at the time, was killed in action a few days later, on 11 December.\n\nAfter a stormy night, a patrol of 2 officers and 29 men returned in the early hours of 1 December to an enemy post they had reconnoitred the night before. They launched an attack under cover of 3-inch Stokes mortars, but the post was fully manned and the men were forced to withdraw in the face of heavy rifle fire. When the patrol returned they were sent back out to try again to take the post, but the enemy maintained their resolute defence and halted the patrol’s second assault; 2nd Lieutenant Bernard Ryland Joseph Gilbert was killed by machine gun fire in the fighting and his men were forced to withdraw once more. The rest of the day passed quietly. In the evening the Battalion was relieved by the 1/6th South Staffs and marched to Brigade Reserve at Noeux-les-Mines where they spent the next 3 days training, cleaning and refitting.\n\nAt 8 o’clock the following morning, an enemy aeroplane dropped a bomb on Brigade Support killing Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Joseph Trump, the popular and respected Commanding Officer of the 1/6th South Staffs, and one other man. During the afternoon of 4 December, the Battalion played their next football match in the 46th Division football league. The game against the Division Signal Company, which ended in a 0 – 0 draw, was played as the village was being shelled; indeed a 10-inch shell fell on the centre of the pitch 5 minutes before full time; fortunately, it failed to explode and the football continued without any break in play. That evening the Battalion was treated to an excellent concert by the 160th Labour Company Pierrot Troupe. The following afternoon – as news came through of the major reverses inflicted on the Allied line by the German counter-attack in the Battle of Cambrai – the men began the march back to the trenches in the Hulluch left subsector. The Battalion officers were told that night patrols did not need to be conducted so diligently. They were told instead to focus their attention on strengthening the barbed wire, starting with the front line and working back from there. When they were out wiring in the cold weather, the men were given hot porridge, hot rice or hot soup at 12.30 a.m. and hot tea or hot cocoa at 3 a.m. They got a tot of rum when they began their shift and had breakfast at 7 a.m. when they stood down.\n\nAt half past ten in the morning of 7 December, a single-seater enemy aeroplane came in range of the Battalion’s anti-aircraft Lewis guns, and was shot down by 8862/200439 Corporal Walter Crutchley; however the Lewis gunners were so buoyed up by this success, and were so busy telling their comrades about it, that they failed to report it immediately, which allowed the Brigade Machine Gun Company to claim the hit.\n\nThat afternoon, the enemy began heavy shelling of Hill 70; the Battalion’s right sector was also targeted and two men from A Company – 203575 Private Thomas Allsop and 17084 Private Walter Lloyd – were killed by a trench mortar shell. At the request of A Company, the Allied Artillery provided appropriate retaliation. 47 reinforcements arrived at the trenches at half past six that evening and were distributed between the four companies; 11 more were kept back for baths, de-lousing and, in one case, treatment for scabies. At 7 o’clock, the enemy sent up numerous lights – red, green, orange and white – and did so again later in the evening, but nothing came of these colourful displays. Two days later, the Battalion was relieved and went into Brigade Support at Noyelles-lès-Vermelles for bathing, equipment cleaning and company inspections.\n\nIn the afternoon of 11 December, on the left flank of the 46th Division front, the 138th Infantry Brigade raided the enemy trenches north of Hulluch Road and penetrated, through the German front and second lines, to the third line. The enemy sustained heavy casualties and their trenches and dugouts were severely damaged. The 138th Infantry Brigade captured 5 prisoners in the attack, and a machine gun, for the loss of 4 men killed and 21 wounded.\n\nThe following afternoon, the 1/5th South Staffs beat Divisional Headquarters 3 – 0 in their latest match in the 46th Division football league. By then, news had reached the Battalion that Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Allenby’s Egyptian Expeditionary Force had surrounded and captured Jerusalem on 9 December, bringing to an end four centuries of rule by the Ottoman Empire. It also freed the city from Muslim control for the first time since the crusades. At home, bells were rung in celebration and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George described the liberation of Jerusalem as \"a Christmas present for the British people\".\n\nPicture 76\n\nBack in the trenches of the Hulluch right subsector, enemy machine gunfire killed 30965 Private William Murray and injured another man at dawn on 14 December. The barbed wire needed strengthening right across the front occupied by the 137th Infantry Brigade. This had become a matter of urgency as the British strategy became more defensive, in anticipation of enemy troops arriving from the Eastern front following the non-aggression pact between Germany and the new Bolshevik leadership in Russia.\n\nIn 1910, Britain’s traditional ally Portugal had overthrown its monarchy. The new Republic was then ruled by a series of unstable governments which seriously undermined the Portuguese economy. Although the country continued to assist its long-time ally, there was no widespread support for Portuguese involvement in the war. Then, in December 1917, a military junta overthrew the ruling Portuguese Government in a coup d'état. The parlous state of the Portuguese economy, and the new regime’s less than enthusiastic support for the war effort, meant that Portugal was now a far from reliable ally, even though it did send about 100,000 Portuguese troops to fight alongside the Allies, in the British sector of the Western Front and also in Mozambique; an estimated 10,000 of these were killed or wounded.\n\nOver the next three days, the weather turned much colder and snow began to fall on 17 December. The Battalion was relieved that afternoon and spent the next 4 days in Brigade Reserve at Noeux-les-Mines. With the hard frost and cheerful fires, at times it almost seemed seasonal, especially as gifts and Christmas cards began to arrive from home. The 1/5th South Staffs received a donation of £75 from the Mayor of Walsall – the 2/5th South Staffs received a similar amount – and Major John Lees, who was recuperating from his wounds back home, collected £100 from friends to swell the Battalion’s Christmas fund, which also received a 1000 Francs contribution from the 137th Infantry Brigade canteen and 500 Francs from the 46th Division.\n\nOn 21 December, the 1/5th moved back up to the front-line trenches in the Hulluch left subsector. Officers returning from leave reported a scarcity of sugar in Walsall, an indication that people back home were also feeling the effects of the war. On Christmas Eve, the 46th Division put on “a show”, targeting the enemy with 900 gas bombs in half an hour, with the 42nd Division on their left joining in to create a massive noise. The Germans retaliated but did little damage. As snow threatened on Christmas Day, the men received extra rations with their breakfast and each Company was provided with a case of bottles of beer, so each man could have one with his dinner. The Battalion was relieved during the afternoon and moved to Brigade Support in Mazingarbe for three days of cleaning, bathing and training in the freezing weather, before moving to the trenches in the Hulluch right subsector during the afternoon of 29 December, the coldest day of the year so far. With snow returning at 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, both sides fired their weapons to welcome in 1918.\n\nAfter a quiet day, the Germans began an intense artillery barrage at 8 o’clock in the evening of New Year’s Day 1918. They were targeting the 3rd Canadian Division on the Battalion’s right flank and the Canadians sustained a large number of casualties as the Germans attacked to the south of Hill 70. 28503 Private Lewis Blower was killed as the 1/5th South Staffs caught the fringe of the enemy shelling and 40024 Private George R. Stanley was wounded and taken to hospital. The following morning there was some aerial activity when two British aeroplanes prevented eleven enemy aircraft from flying over the Allied lines. That afternoon the Battalion was relieved and went again to Brigade Reserve at Noeux-les-Mines. At 1 o’clock the following afternoon, the sergeants carved and waited on the men as they finally got to enjoy a grand meal, their Christmas Dinner and New Year Dinner all rolled into one: 90 turkeys, 60 geese, hams, cake and a bottle of beer for each man. The sergeants then sat down to their own meal, and the officers had theirs at 8 p.m.\n\nThe weather was cold in Brigade Reserve, but strenuous training and gas mask practice filled the days until the men returned to the trenches in the Hulluch left subsector on 7 January: D Company in the tunnels; C Company providing troops for Vendin Post; A Company, B Company and the remnants of C Company in the Reserve Line. The 46th Division Commander, Major General William Thwaites, visited Battalion Headquarters at noon the following day; as he wished everyone a Happy New Year, he announced that the 46th Division was due to be relieved for a six-week holiday. On 10 January, as rain brought a welcome thaw in the weather, word came through that the divisional relief was scheduled to start on 16 January and that the Battalion would be replaced by the 33rd Infantry Brigade of the 11th Division. As part of the normal rotations, the 1/5th South Staffs were relieved that afternoon and, while A Company and B Company remained in Tenth Avenue, the rest of the men had a slushy and muddy march back to Brigade Support in Mazingarbe. Nightly patrols had resumed during this tour and, although they had taken no prisoners, the men’s morale remained high.\n\nAfter 2 days of heavy snow, the 1/5th moved back to the Hulluch right subsector on 14 January. There was little evidence that the winter weather had done any serious damage to the trenches which were in surprisingly good order. However, a raid that night by the Canadians brought a swift enemy response that left the Battalion’s front line “knocked about a bit”. The following evening, orders came through postponing the promised divisional relief. The decision had been taken as a precaution; after heavy snow – and now rain, hail and thunderstorms – the thaw had made movement treacherous; the mud made the trench boards so slippery that one company asked for pumps to remove some of the stagnant water.\n\nAfter another brief period in Brigade Reserve at Noeux-les-Mines, the Battalion moved up once more, during the afternoon and evening of 22 January, to the trenches in the Hulluch right subsector. Their first day passed quietly but, at 9 o’clock that night, 2nd Lieutenant Ronald Terence Bloor led a party of 8 men from C Company on patrol. There was bright moonlight and the patrol was spotted. The men came under rifle and machine gun fire near the enemy barbed wire and 40206 Private John Edward Williams and 2nd Lieutenant Bloor were wounded, the latter severely. 2nd Lieutenant Bloor’s men fetched a stretcher, and carried him back to the Battalion lines, but he died of his wounds at the dressing station.\n\nThe next day, 24 January, was quiet with the promise of good weather to come. That evening the Battalion was replaced by the 6th Battalion of the Border Regiment as part of the promised divisional relief; the men marched to billets in Houchin, Battalion Headquarters to Fouquières-lés-Béthune, as the 137th Infantry Brigade moved to Corps Reserve.\n\nThe first two days were spent cleaning up and re-organising from 2 to 3 platoons per company. Church Parade on 27 January was followed by two days of wiring south of Drouvin-le-Marais. Word came through on 30 January that the 1/5th North Staffs had been transferred to the 176th Infantry Brigade in the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division; a week later, they absorbed the remnants of the 2/5th North Staffs, that Battalion and the 2/6th North Staffs ceasing to exist as separate units. This was part of a wider re-organisation designed to reduce each brigade from 4 to 3 battalions because of the shortage of men on the Western Front. The weather turned much colder at the end of January, but practice continued on the firing range; wiring, training and inspections filled the first week of February 1918 which ended with the men preparing for a long march, though they were not told the destination. A loaded lorry went ahead on 8 February and, at twenty past eight the following morning, the Battalion marched to Vaudricourt where they formed up with the rest of the 137th Infantry Brigade – Brigade Headquarters, Billeting Parties, 1/6th North Staffs, 1/6th South Staffs, 1/5th North Staffs and 1/5th South Staffs. At 10 o’clock, the long column set off for Burbure via Fouquières-les-Béthune, Fouqueuril, Labeuvrière, Lapugnoy, Marles-les-Mines and Lozinghem, a distance of about 12 miles. Fortunately, the weather was fine and they reached Burbure at a quarter past two in the afternoon, no one having fallen by the wayside. At twenty past eight the following morning the Battalion marched to Heuchin via Hurionville, La Bellery, Amettes, Nédon, Fontaine-lès-Hermans and Fontaines-lès-Boulans, a similar distance to the previous day but in horrible, wet conditions that left 3 men unable to keep up.\n\nTraining, rest and recreation filled the rest of February but, on 1 March, the men were on the move once more. Over the next four days they made their way via Febvin-Palfart and Busnes to Beuvry. On 5 March, at half past eight in the morning, the 1/5th South Staffs moved up to the trenches in the Cuinchy north subsector, 5 miles east of Bethune; there they shared the 137th Infantry Brigade’s front and support lines with the 1/6th North Staffs who had moved to the Cuinchy south subsector. They were now about 5 miles north-west of the Hulluch subsector.\n\nPicture 77\n\nThe 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment occupied about 750 yards of the front, from The Lane to La Bassée Canal. The company on the left occupied the Brickstack area; the Allies held 15 of these stacks altogether. There were defended by machine gun emplacements in the stacks themselves and several had men, in position, in trenches behind them. Tunnels led to these posts but the tunnels in that area were markedly different to those the men had experienced in the Hulluch sector; these were very low and resulted in a great deal of bad language, even from the officers. The Germans held 13 brickstacks in front of the Battalion and the No Man’s Land that separated the two sides was a mess of unoccupied shell holes and craters, the barbed wire being in a poor state on both sides. The 1/6th South Staffs were in Support to the west, at Annequin and Le Préolan; the 138th Infantry Brigade were to the right of the 137th, and the 139th Infantry Brigade were in Divisional Reserve at Beuvry.\n\nThere was a great deal of noise on the Battalion’s left at 5.30 a.m. the following morning, as if the enemy was welcoming them to the area. The Company on the right flank and Battalion Headquarters in Glasgow Road were also targeted by gas shells; there were no casualties, just the inconvenience and discomfort of having to wear gas masks. Things settled down after that initial flurry and the days were generally fine and quiet. On 8 March, an officer from the Machine Gun Corps was attached to the 1/5th South Staffs as liaison; being young, he got his leg pulled repeatedly. Next day, the Battalion relieved the 1/6th South Staffs in Brigade Support; A Company and B Company moved into Village Line, C Company and D Company into the unshelled section of the village of Annequin that lay north of La Bassée Road. The men’s first tour in the Cuinchy sector had been generally quiet and free of casualties. That evening, 9 March, the enemy fired 200 gas shells, targeting battery positions to the Battalion’s rear. The response came in the very early hours of both the 11th and 12th March, when the Allied artillery harassed the enemy lines north of La Bassée canal. Although the nights were cold and frosty, these days in early Spring saw some glorious sunshine.\n\nA second tour of the front-line trenches, from 13th to 17th March, saw an increase in action from the enemy artillery; meanwhile, night-time Battalion patrols in No Man’s Land passed uneventfully. On 16 March, the enemy targeted the Cuinchy area and succeeded in knocking in the entrance to Marylebone Tunnel, burying one man from the 1/5th South Staffs. Although the German shells did not contain poison gas, the explosion caused afterdamp which injured 9 men, 3 of whom had to be sent away for treatment. The enemy artillery also caused some damage to Hertford Street and Esperanto Street. {“Firedamp” is the name given to the flammable gas – consisting primarily of methane – that accumulates in pockets in coal seams. Firedamp is derived from the German word “dampf”, meaning vapours. “Afterdamp” is the mixture of choking and suffocating gases found in a coal mine after a fire or explosion caused by firedamp; afterdamp has a high content of carbon dioxide, but can also contain nitrogen, carbon monoxide and sometimes hydrogen sulphide.}\n\nThe 55th Division raided the northern side of La Bassée canal at 5 o’clock in the morning of 17 March, but this had no effect on the Battalion’s relief by the 1/6th South Staffs which was completed by 11 a.m. The Battalion moved into Brigade Support in the Cuinchy Sector of the Cambrin defences; A Company and B Company moved into Village Line, north of La Bassée Road; C Company, D Company and Battalion Headquarters into Annequin. The Cambrin defences were in a state of neglect, but the Battalion was advised not to work on them too openly in case they attracted enemy attention. However, the barbed wiring was in good condition, and the machine gun placements had been sited with care, making the area difficult to attack. The trench lines were clear, so the men took picks and shovels with them as they made their way up to their posts. There were no accommodation dugouts, which forced the infantry to take what rest they could in the open trenches. At night, parties of 150 men worked on the barbed wire.\n\n18 March was a bright summer day with more enemy aerial activity than normal. That evening, the Germans lit up the sky as they shelled what they wrongly thought were allied gun positions near the Fosse. Reports – based on information supplied by a prisoner captured by the 138th Infantry Brigade – indicated that the Germans were planning an offensive that month directed against Richebourg and the area south of La Bassée canal. On 20 March, the Battalion completed its reconnaissance of the Cambrin Defences and prepared its defence scheme. The enemy artillery was very active the next morning as the Battalion moved to Le Préolan after being relieved by the 1/6th South Staffs. There was very heavy bombardment of the Allied front and shelling near the quartermaster stores left 9 men from the 1/5th wounded. The Battalion received telephone orders to stand to arms, which they did until the early hours of 22 March, when it became clear that the focus of the German attack had been the 138th Infantry Brigade, who had 2 men killed, 1 wounded and 14 taken prisoner.\n\nThe withdrawal of Russia from the war in December 1917 allowed the German Army to transfer 50 divisions from the Eastern Front, bringing relief to and substantially increasing its forces on the Western Front. Aware that submarine warfare had failed to force Britain to the negotiating table, the Germans launched a massive offensive on 21 March 1918 with the intention of bringing an end to the war before the American Expeditionary Force could be fully deployed. The German aim was to isolate the British Expeditionary Force first and, having done so, then compel the French to surrender.\n\nPicture 78\n\nOn 22 March, information reached the 1/5th South Staffs that the German Offensive had begun across a 50–mile front, focussing on the areas near Cambrai and to the south of Arras; however, early communiques indicated that the enemy had not, as yet, broken through divisional lines.\n\nOn 23 March, the Battalion marched about 5 miles to Divisional Headquarters at Fouquières-lès-Béthune where 28 officers and 568 other ranks were inspected by Major General William Thwaites, the General Officer Commanding the 46th Division; they then marched back to Le Préolan. The questioning of prisoners taken by the 138th Infantry Division had generated reports saying that three divisions had arrived to reinforce the 4th Ersatz, the enemy division facing the 1/5th South Staffs across No Man’s Land; furthermore, the enemy was planning to attack on 25 March. As a precaution the Battalion was ordered to stand to – with rifles loaded and bayonets fixed – from dusk till dawn during the night of 24/25 March. The Allied artillery was expected to hold back the assault by bombarding – at regular one-minute intervals – the German rear and front lines, and the roads and tracks the enemy would use. In the event, the Allied artillery did not go into action and the night passed quietly apart from a plane that flew low over Le Préolan firing tracer bullets at the Battalion billets; fortunately, these did no damage. In the meantime, the 55th Division took some prisoners as they carried out raids on the Battalion’s left.\n\nAt 9 o’clock in the morning of 25 March, the Battalion relieved the 1/6th South Staffs in the Cuinchy Sector. The 1/5th were careful and vigilant as they took over the posts previously held by the 1/6th, however the front line was occupied only at the tunnel entrances; isolated posts in the front line were also withdrawn in anticipation of the German attack; the Battalion did occupy the reserve line, but only with guns trained on the enemy trenches. Intelligence reports suggested that, to support their major offensive to the south, the Germans were planning subsidiary attacks, including one south of the La Bassée Canal. At 11.30 p.m. that night, the Battalion received orders to be on alert, to thin their front line at 2.30 a.m., and to listen out for tank movements on the roads as the enemy was expected to attack in the moonlight. In the event, the night again passed peacefully, patrols going out until 3.00 a.m. but finding nothing to report.\n\nAt 9 o’clock in the morning of 26 March, the Battalion heard that they might be ordered to move if the tactical situation changed. At 9.25 p.m. the Company on the left reported heavy motors on La Bassée Road, and the Allied artillery turned in anticipation of enemy tank movements, but – once again – the night passed peacefully. At 10.30 a.m. on 27 March, the Battalion was notified by Brigade Headquarters that the 46th (North Midland) Division was going to take over the front at Lens from the 4th Canadian Division, the 137th Infantry Brigade replacing the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Following its relief that afternoon by the 1/4th Battalion King’s Own Royal (Lancaster) Regiment, the 1/5th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment moved to Le Preol which was then, and still is, a village of just a few houses; meanwhile, the Division’s two other battalions went straight to the front line at Lens. The following afternoon, the Battalion marched to nearby Beuvry expecting to board buses at 4.30 p.m. but these did not arrive until 9 p.m. Once the equipment was loaded, the men boarded the 30 buses and left for Souchez, 12 miles to the south; from there they marched 3 miles to Lievin, the old mining town 3 miles to the west of Lens, where they took over the billets vacated by the 1/6th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment who had gone up into the front line. The Battalion War Diary describes Lievin at that time as “all broken houses and devastation, well shelled continuously”. On 30 March, the 46th (North Midland) Division was congratulated on its relief of the 4th Canadian Division, which had gone “without a hitch in difficult circumstances”. After dark that evening, the 1/5th South Staffs moved up to the Lens left sector in the rain to relieve the 1/6th North Staffs.\n\nOn the last day of March 1918, Lieutenant Colonel James Lamond returned from leave and resumed command of the Battalion. It was a fine day with a drying wind and the sun shone brightly. Information had been received that, on 28 March, the Germans had planned to capture the Arras-Lens railway line and then attack Vimy Ridge from the south; if they were successful, they would then launch an attack on the Hulluch front, south of La Bassée Canal, pushing on towards Hill 70. Thankfully, the enemy’s initial attack failed on 28 March otherwise the Battalion would have been in a difficult position.\n\nApril 1918 began with some gas shelling of the Brigade front in the very early hours but otherwise the first two days were quiet. On 3 April, the 1/5th South Staffs moved back to Brigade Support in Lievin; once again there was heavy gas shelling, but no casualties were sustained. The decision had been taken that only those personnel needed for a tour would be sent into the trenches; alongside this, a percentage of all ranks would go back to the Transport Lines where they would receive divisional training for offensive action; in particular, 16 NCOs would undertake a special class lasting 10 days. The first such batch – comprising the 2nd in Command, the Adjutant, 9 officers and 99 other ranks – left by train for Albert Camp at Carency at 8.15 p.m. on 3 April; the rest of the men remained behind, to go into the line at the next relief. It rained all that evening.\n\nOn 5 April the Battalion relieved the 1/6th North Staffs in the Lens right sector, where they stayed until 10 April when they were relieved in turn by the 1/6th South Staffs. Night patrols were largely unsuccessful, but a German officer was killed during the night of 8/9 April; a map was taken from his body showing details of an intended enemy raid on the left subsector; this information was passed on and the necessary precautions were taken. The following night one officer and a man from the ranks were wounded as another patrol tried, unsuccessfully, to take an enemy post.\n\nAfter a short period in Brigade Support, and a night at Marqueffles Farm, the companies moved by light railway to Aix-Noulette and from there marched to billets in Beugin, 15 miles to the west of Lens. After two days spent cleaning up and training, orders came through, just after midday on 17 April, to move to a position next to the site the No. 6 Casualty Clearing Station had just vacated in a camp at Hallicourt. Not unnaturally, the 34th Division Field Ambulance – which had remained there – objected to having combatant soldiers billeted so close and, after a night’s rest, the Battalion moved to the other side of the railway where they pitched camp with the 1/6th South Staffs. Five days of training followed, though the Battalion was given orders to be ready to move at 2 hours’ notice, though this was sometimes relaxed to 4 hours.\n\nOn 24 April, the 1/5th South Staffs moved to Verquin and the next day, with the 1/6th South Staffs on their left, the Battalion moved into trenches in the Gorre sector, B Company and C Company in the front line, A Company and D Company in the support line.\n\nEnemy airplanes were active at midday the next day and that afternoon and evening the enemy again targeted Battalion Headquarters, wounding Orderly Room clerk 200561 Private Reginald Nicholls. That night the 1/6th North Staffs relieved the 1/5th South Staffs who moved back to Brigade Support in Essars, the 1st Monmouth Battalion’s D Company remaining with the 1/6th North Staffs. Gas shelling of C Company on 28 May caused no further casualties, the enemy misjudging and landing the shells well behind the Battalion’s positions all day. Two officers joined the Battalion as reinforcements the following evening, the Battalion then moving up to relieve the 1/6th South Staffs in the Essars right subsector. During the very early hours of 30 May, a small German patrol approached B Company’s No.2 Post on the left front, threw some bombs and then bolted; the post’s Lewis gun opened fire and killed the patrol’s N.C.O. who was later identified as being from the German 190th Infantry Regiment. An hour later the enemy artillery targeted C Company on the right front but did no damage. It later became clear that this was to cover another unsuccessful enemy raid on Route A Keep. During the day, 6 more officers joined from the Base Reinforcement Camp and the final afternoon of May 1918 saw the enemy lay down a light 20-minute artillery barrage of the Battalion’s front line and left support line, but there were no casualties and no damage was done; from the amount of lights the enemy sent up, they appeared to be testing their S.O.S. lines. The weather in May had been fine and hot, the nights warm, but the Battalion’s night patrols had produced little of value. It had been a costly month for the 1/5th, with 5 officers and 3 men killed, 11 men wounded and taken to hospital, 4 officers and 184 men sent to hospital suffering from gas exposure, and 3 men wounded who remained on duty.\n\nSomehow, James Merrick had managed to survive another harrowing month on the Western Front. However, as he served in both C Company and D Company, it is possible that he was amongst those from D Company who were affected by the enemy gas shelling on 22 May.\n\nJune 1918 began with the Battalion in the line in the Essars right subsector. 1 June was a quiet day but, sadly, 14474 Private Daniel O’Connell from D Company was killed when two patrols went out. Patrols also went out during the night of 2/3 June, during which 20462 Private Sidney Colcombe of A Company was killed and 2nd Lieutenant Charles Joseph Murphy and another man from the ranks were wounded. Although these patrols often found little to report, the group that went out on a full daylight patrol on 3 June, led by 2nd Lieutenant Arthur Oswald Jones and 200358 Sergeant Victor Norman Marston, were commended by the 46th Division Commander for “a most excellent reconnaissance affording much valuable information”.\n\nRelieved by the 1/5th Battalion Leicestershire Regiment during the early hours of 4 June, the Battalion spent the next few days in 46th Division Reserve at Vaudricourt Wood, bathing and cleaning up before returning just after midnight on 8 June to the support line of the Gorre sector. That night the enemy targeted Battalion Headquarters with Yellow Cross mustard gas shells but the shell holes were successfully treated with chlorine and there were no casualties. During the evening of 9/10 June the Battalion relieved the 1/5th North Staffs in the Gorre right subsector. Two night patrols went out, followed by one in the daylight, but all was quiet; once again the 46th Division Commander sent his congratulations, this time for the “useful work” done by the group led by 2nd Lieutenant Cyril Stuart Embrey. There were no more casualties as the night and day patrols continued through to the end of this tour, and there was further praise, this time for the “good and useful reconnaissance” done by the party led by 2nd Lieutenant William Jennings Bond. Relieved by the 1/6th South Staffs during the night of 13/14 June, the Battalion moved into the Gorre support lines where they worked on the support defences. Then, during the night of 14/15 June, the German 3rd Division advanced their line on the left and – in the forward positions – A Company and D Company came under fairly heavy shell fire, during which 2271 240277 Private Fred Simpson was killed and five men from the ranks were wounded. Relieved 24 hours later, the Battalion returned to the 46th Division Reserve, A Company and B Company in Vaudricourt Wood, C Company and D Company at Verquin. Bathing, equipment cleaning and training were the order of the day, with A Company and B Company on the Lewis Gun range and all the men undertaking a one hour, 2-mile night march in box respirators before the 1/5th South Staffs moved to the left Essars sector during the night of 17/18 June. The following night the enemy artillery was very active, targeting the trenches leading to the Battalion’s front line. Two patrols went out and 241097 Private Edward Smith was killed; two men from the ranks were also wounded. Although the following night was quieter, the German artillery continued to shell the approach trenches and 5 men from the ranks were injured when a shell entered the Regimental Aid Post. The enemy artillery was very active between 10.15 and 11.30 p.m. on 21 June, targeting D Company on the Battalion’s right front. A night patrol went out, another in the daylight, and one man from the ranks was wounded. The 1/5th South Staffs moved into the Essars support line when they were relieved during the evening of 23 June; the next relief – 72 hours later – took them to the right Essars sector, where 2 more men were wounded, and the end of June 1918 saw the Battalion back in the 46th Division Reserve in Vaudricourt Wood.\n\nPicture 87\n\nDuring the evening of 1 July 1918, the 1/5th South Staffs relieved the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters in the Gorre right subsector; they remained there until the night of 3 July when they moved back to Brigade Support. From there they went to the Gorre left subsector where 3029 202723 Private William H Bainbridge was killed in action on 4 July 1918. At 7.10 p.m. on 7 July the enemy began heavy shelling in the vicinity of Battalion Headquarters and Gorre Bridge; 10 minutes later the bridge had been destroyed; after a further 10 minutes the shelling began to ease and, half an hour after it started, the shelling ceased altogether. Mercifully, the next day was quiet. The Battalion was relieved by the 1/4th Battalion Leicestershire Regiment between 9.30 p.m. on 9 July and 1.10 a.m. on 10 July, and then returned by light railway to Brigade Reserve for training and to clean up. The weather was fine on 13 July as the Battalion paraded and then, in the afternoon, enjoyed the Battalion’s combined Sports and Horse Show. After Church Parade on Sunday 14 July, the 46th Division Commander congratulated the men – of all ranks – whose daylight patrols had been particularly effective, saying that these were now being carried out across the 46th Division. Short tours of the Gorre and Essars front lines followed and, on 20 July, 9256 200637 Sergeant Herbert Stanley Marston was killed in action.\n\nJust after midday on 22 July, a daylight patrol consisting of 2nd Lieutenant Cyril Stuart Embrey and 46542 Lance Corporal Albert Edward Furze left No. 6 Post; moving east, they spotted the heads of 2 enemy soldiers in a shell-hole close to the barbed wire and a few yards from one of the Battalion’s front-line posts. Uncertain how many enemy troops were hiding there, the patrol returned, fetched 3 more men and then took up favourable positions either side of the shell-hole. When they were given the signal, the patrol threw 3 bombs and – covered by the smoke – rushed the enemy position. An officer and three German soldiers bolted and made their escape, although one of the three was wounded; 2 others surrendered and a third lay dying from his wounds. The enemy patrol were from the German 395th Reserve Infantry Regiment and had taken up their positions at about 3 a.m. in scooped-out shell holes, their intention being to attack an Allied patrol or one of the Battalion’s front-line posts if the opportunity arose. The two prisoners were brought in and a search was made for the wounded member of the German patrol, but only blood tracks were found. The remainder of that day, and the day that followed, were both quiet.\n\nAt 2.50 a.m. on 24 July, an attack was thwarted on one of the front posts of the brigade to the left of the 137th Infantry Brigade. Enemy shelling then spread along the whole length of the 46th Division front, finally easing at about 4 a.m. That day saw the death in action of 201803 Private Albert Adshead and 3815 3286 202973 Corporal Frank Edward Willmore. Also, at 6 o’clock that evening, a German carrier pigeon was caught and the coded message it was carrying was sent off to be deciphered.\n\nA brief period in Brigade Support was followed by a longer rest period in Divisional Reserve where the 1/5th South Staffs trained and cleaned up – on short notice to move in case an attack was made on the Allied 3rd Division. Sadly, the Brigade Horse Show on 29 July was rather spoiled by the rain. Battalion working parties continued to perform well, improving the trench system and digging a cable trench. In a memo dated 20 July, the General Officer commanding the 46th Division had commended the 137th Infantry Brigade – and, in particular, the 1/5th South Staffs – on the amount of salvage they had recovered from the battlefield; the memo went on to chastise 3 other battalions, one for recovering well below its average amount and two for reclaiming nothing at all. Casualties were light in July compared with earlier months, just 4 men killed in action and 17 wounded, 4 of whom remained on duty.\n\nIt rained all day on 2 August, the Battalion’s last day in the 46th Division Reserve. That evening, as the 137th Infantry Brigade relieved the 139th, the 1/5th South Staffs were taken by light railway as far as the La Bassée Canal then made their way on foot to le Hamel in the Essars right subsector where they relieved the 1/5th Sherwood Foresters. It stopped raining the next day and the weather the day after was fine as three new 2nd Lieutenants joined the Battalion. 4 August also saw the award of the Military Cross to 2nd Lieutenant Embrey and the Military Medal to Lance Corporal Furze for their part in the encounter with the enemy on 22 July.\n\nPicture 89\n\nThe rain returned on 5 August as rumours spread that the enemy was planning to withdraw on that front; however, in the short term, the speculation proved to be largely unfounded. A 3-day period in Brigade Support followed, and the area close to Essars Church was targeted for a quarter of an hour in the afternoon of 6 August by 50 high explosive shells but no serious damage was done. Although that night was quiet, there was a lot of aerial activity and both sides lit up the sky with searchlights after dark. A message was received the next day from the 1/6th North Staffs saying that one of its platoons had occupied Le Cason Farm but there had been no other enemy withdrawals on their side of the Lawe River; when they relieved the 1/6th North Staffs in the Essars left subsector during the night of 8/9 August, the Battalion’s posts on the bank of the Lawe River were more advanced than those of their predecessors. 2nd Lieutenant Bernard Whitecraft Tolton was wounded at 6 a.m. on 9 August while he led a morning patrol of the banks of the River Lawe; his patrol still managed to bring back useful information. Later in the day there was some shelling of the Battalion front and, in the early evening, the Allied guns responded. 9436 20060 203353 Private John Witsey was killed in action that day.\n\nThe weather was fine the following day, 10 August, but sadly 2405 20520 203423 Sergeant Thomas Hardwick was killed in action and 4259 201023 235398 Private Joseph Latham died from his wounds. Then, at about 7 o’clock in the evening, a deserter from the German 1st Guards Regiment surrendered to C Company; he said that the 1st Guards Division had moved into the enemy front line 3 days before, but he did not want to serve in the Prussian Army as he was from Lorraine. When he was questioned, he revealed that the enemy were completing a new front line, about three-quarters of a mile behind their present one, and the Germans were expected to move there in about 2 weeks’ time. {Following its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, France had been forced to cede the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire. As a result, Germany gained 26% of Lorraine in the upper Moselle valley and 93% of Alsace in the Rhine Valley; France retained the remaining parts of those two regions. Following its defeat in the First World War, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles compelled Germany to accept punitive territorial, military, and economic sanctions that included the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France.}\n\nDuring the hour before midnight, the enemy targeted D Company Headquarters with gas shells; an aeroplane then dropped a bomb that smashed the Company Headquarters, killing 6 men – 7962 200125 Sergeant Edward Cadnam, 8526 200305 Private John Henry Lewis, 564 201185 Acting Sergeant Frank Clifford Maskell, 6875 200034 Sergeant Albert William Stace, 2040 20110 235001 Private William Albert Taylor and 964 9611 200766 Private Thomas Tromans – and wounding 20 more. The following day was quieter but several men from D Company were suffering from the effects of the previous night’s gas poisoning; also, 3918 3365 203252 Private Albert Victor Myatt died from his wounds.\n\n12 August was also quiet but the following afternoon the enemy shelled Battalion Headquarters, killing 2 men – 14422 Private Joseph Howes and 1300 201597 Lance Corporal Thomas Edwin Metcalf – and injuring 7 others. 42470 Private John William Shaw also died that day; he passed away at the Number 6 Casualty Clearing Station from the effects of gas poisoning. During the evening of 14 August there was heavy shelling of the line occupied by the left support company, B Company, and its headquarters, but thankfully there were no further casualties. Overnight, the Battalion was relieved by the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters and moved to Divisional Support in Vaudricourt Wood. Their first full day there was hot and fine, and the men spent it cleaning up; in the afternoon, the XIII Army Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Lethbridge Napier Morland, toured the camp. After a hot day spent training, the 1/5th South Staffs received orders at 7 p.m. on 16 August to stand ready to move at 2 hours’ notice as Army Intelligence suspected the enemy were preparing to pull back from their current position; in the event the Battalion was not needed. Instead, its 19 officers and 467 men paraded at 2.45 a.m. before being taken by light railway to work on the Newcastle line in the Gorre sector; by 9.30 a.m. their tasks had been completed, to the satisfaction of the officers of the 1st Monmouth (Pioneers) Regiment, and the Battalion then returned by train to Vaudricourt Wood, arriving back at 11.30 a.m.\n\nIt remained quiet for the remainder of their time in Divisional Support but on 20 August the 137th Infantry Brigade relieved the 138th, the Battalion replacing the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters in Brigade Support in the Essars sector. After two more hot days, the weather broke and it turned much cooler. Wearing boots in the heat had caused particular problems and arrangements were made for the men to bathe their feet daily. During the evening of 23 August they were on the move again, this time to the Loisne area in the Le Hamel right subsector.\n\nAt 7.25 a.m. on 24 August the British artillery targeted the enemy positions facing the Battalion and the 46th Division front. The 55th Division attacked at the same time and secured the mine system at Festubert – 4 miles to the east of Essars – that had been taken by the enemy the previous March; fortunately, the enemy’s retaliation along the front occupied by the 137th Infantry Brigade was largely ineffective. The four companies of the 1/5th South Staffs pushed their outpost lines forward during the last week of August 1918. Then, on 29 August, the enemy at last showed signs of pulling back. The weather had turned fine after rain the previous day and the Battalion, advancing in three stages, moved forward about 2500 yards and succeeded in establishing a new outpost line that was then extended on the left by the 1/6th North Staffs.\n\nThe days had been fine and sunny, in the main, during the Battalion’s periods in the front-line during August 1918 but casualties had also been high, with 10 men from the ranks killed, 3 officers and 69 other ranks wounded (21 of them from gas poisoning).\n\nOn 2 September, the 1/5th South Staffs moved into 46th Division Reserve in Verquin. The following afternoon they marched 2½ miles to Hesdigneul-lès-Béthune. Such was the high regard in which the 46th (North Midland) Division Commander, Major General William Thwaites, was held that the men of the 137th Infantry Brigade lined the road and cheered as he left to take up the post of Director of Military Intelligence, having relinquished the command of the 46th that he had held since July 1916. He was succeeded by Major-General Sir Gerald Farrell Boyd.\n\nOn 5 September, after a day’s training at Hesdigneul-lès-Béthune, the Battalion marched 6 miles west to billets in Lozinghem, the 46th Division having been relieved by the 19th Division. It was a hot day and the men were out of training, having not marched in full packs for about six months. Sixteen fell out along the way and, although 6 re-joined the march, 10 had to be transported the rest of the way by ambulance. The following day, the 137th Infantry Brigade paraded as a guard of honour while the XIII Army Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Morland, presented medal ribbons; a French general also presented medals, then took the salute as the Brigade marched past. The men then returned to their billets while Major-General Boyd met the officers of the 137th in Lozinghem Church where he praised the Brigade’s fine standard.\n\nThe Companies resumed their training on 7th and 9th September; in between it rained all day and the planned Church of England and non-conformist Church Parades were cancelled, giving the men the opportunity to bathe. On 9 September, Major Charles Child Dowding DSO MC joined the Battalion from the King’s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment, taking up the post of 2nd in Command to Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred White who had taken command of the 1/5th South Staffs on 1 September when Lieutenant-Colonel James Lamond had returned to England for 6 months home service.\n\nOn 7 September, in his Special Order of the Day, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France, Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig, gave an upbeat assessment of Allied successes that had turned the tide of the war following the German Spring Offensive. A second Special Order three days later informed the men of the congratulatory telegram Haig had received from the Queen Mother, Queen Alexandra, the wife of King Edward VII, and Haig’s reply to her on behalf of the men he commanded.\n\nOn 10 September, as the Battalion prepared to move in the wet weather, Lieutenant General Morland thanked the 1/5th South Staffs for 2½ months of good work with the XIII Army Corps. The next evening, A Company moved by Divisional train number 3 from Lillers at 7.41 p.m., the remainder of the Battalion following on train number 6 at 10.41 p.m. The men travelled via Sai"
