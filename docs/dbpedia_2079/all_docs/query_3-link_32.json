        "text": "The 193rd Special Operations Wing, located at Harrisburg International Airport, Middletown, Pennsylvania, provides highly trained, multi-capable, relevant, and resilient combat and support forces…anytime, anywhere, all-purpose. In peacetime, the unit serves under the governor of Pennsylvania, bolstering missions such as support to civilian authorities during natural disaster or homeland security. In wartime or in a contingency, it reports to Air Force Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field, Florida, its gaining major command.\n\nMISSION\n\nThe 193rd SOW’s primary mission is to fly and maintain the MC-130J Commando II, flying clandestine, or low visibility, single or multiship, low-level infiltration, exfiltration and resupply of special operations forces, by airdrop or airland and air refueling missions for special operations helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft, intruding politically sensitive or hostile territories. The MC-130J primarily flies missions at night to reduce probability of visual acquisition and intercept by airborne threats. Its secondary mission includes the airdrop of leaflets.\n\nMANNING\n\nThe 193rd SOW employs more than 1,900 Guardsmen, mostly traditional Airmen who serve one weekend a month and at least 15 active duty days per year. Full-time federal technicians are the nucleus of the wing. They provide management continuity to keep the units combat ready. Technicians carry a dual status as full-time civil service employees for the Air Force who, as a condition of employment, must participate as Guardsmen. More than 450 technicians support the wing in day-to-day operations.\n\nUNIT HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe airborne radio and television broadcast mission originated in the mid-1960s with the EC-121, known as Coronet Solo. The mission later transitioned to the EC-130E , in 1980 and eventually to the EC-130J in 2004. Soon after the 193rd SOW received EC-130s, the Air National Guard unit participated in the rescue of American citizens in Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. Then known as Volant Solo, the aircraft acted as an airborne radio station, keeping the citizens of Grenada informed about the U.S. military action. Several years later in 1989, Volant Solo was instrumental in the success of coordinated psychological operations in Operation Just Cause. During this mission it broadcast throughout the initial phases of the operation, helping to end the Noriega regime.\n\nIn 1990, the 193rd joined the newly formed Air Force Special Operations Command, and the wing’s aircraft were re-designated Commando Solo, with no change in mission. In 1990-91, Commando Solo was deployed to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Its missions included broadcasting the “Voice of the Gulf” and other highly successful programs intended to convince Iraqi soldiers to surrender.\n\nIn 1994, Commando Solo was used to broadcast radio and TV messages to the citizens and leaders of Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was featured in these broadcasts, which contributed to the orderly transition from military rule to democracy. In 1996, Commando Solo was dispatched on short notice to the Balkans in order to broadcast information that ultimately led to the successful implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nContinuing its tradition, in 1997 the 193rd SOW and Commando Solo supported the United Nations’ Operation Joint Guard with radio and TV broadcasts over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of stabilization forces operations. In 1998, the unit and its aircraft participated in Operation Desert Thunder, a deployment to Southwest Asia to convince Iraq to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Commando Solo was again sent into action in 1999 in support of Operation Allied Force. The aircraft was tasked to broadcast radio and television into Kosovo to help prevent ethnic cleansing. In 2001, before one bomb was dropped or multitudes of troops deployed, the Commando Solo aircraft broadcasted messages to the local Afghan population and Taliban soldiers during Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2010, the unit and its aircraft, participated in Operation Unified Response, contributing to the relief efforts in Haiti after it the southern reign of the country was struck by the magnitude 7.0 earthquake.\n\nThroughout the Global War on Terror, the Commando Solo was deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. More recently, the EC-130J was redeployed to the Middle East in support of the Global War on Terror.\n\nThe first MC-130J Commando II aircraft arrived at Middletown, Pa., Feb 2, 2023, achieving a major milestone in the 193rd Special Operations Wing’s mission conversion from the Commando Solo. The 193 SOW is the first, and currently the only, Air National Guard unit to receive the Commando II mission, a flagship mission of Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nASSIGNED ORGANIZATIONS\n\n• 193rd Air Operations Group, State College, Pennsylvania.
