        "text": "Raised at Liverpool in Sydney's south west, the 4th Battalion was the last of the first - it became the fourth battalion of the 1st Brigade (/explore/units/139) in the 1st Division. Its members were originally drawn from New South Wales.\n\nOn August 4 1914 Great Britain declared war on Germany. Australia quickly followed the Mother Land’s call to arms. A rush of volunteers flocked to Victoria Barracks in Paddington and to Liverpool in Sydney's south west to enlist.\n\nFrom the city and suburbs clerks laid down their pens, shopkeepers and shop assistants walked out of their shops, solicitors paused with their briefs, workmen downed their picks and shovels and from the countryside bushmen, farmers, graziers, shearers, woodchoppers set out on by horse drawn buggy, by train, by horse and on foot starting their journey to join a new type of army - an all volunteer army - the Australian Imperial Force.\n\nOn 17th August all those that had volunteered and enlisted in the preceding days were called into Victoria Barracks where they were divided into four Battalions.\n\nThus 4th Battalion came into being alongside the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions, forming the 1st Australian Infantry Brigade. The Battalion was then marched to Randwick Racecourse where attestations were completed with the recruits signing on for the duration of the war and four months.\n\nIt departed Australia in October 1914.\n\nThe Battalion arrived in Egypt on 2 December 1914 and landed at Gallipoli on the first day, as part of the second and third waves; its CO was killed on the 26th.\n\nIt served on the peninsula until the evacuation in December. In Egypt in March 1916 the AIF was ‘doubled’: the 4th and 5th Divisions were added to the 1st and 2nd Divisions, which already existed. The sixteen battalions which had fought on Gallipoli were each split, with half the personnel in each going to form a ‘pup’ or 'daughter' battalion; the gaps were filled with new recruits from Australia. The 4th Battalion's 'pup' unit was the 56th Battalion, (/explore/units/205) which was part of the 14th Brigade (/explore/units/803) in the 5th Division.\n\nThe 4th Battalion moved to France in March 1916, and spent the rest of the war on or behind the Western Front, principally fighting on the Somme and near Ypres. It ceased active operations in September 1918.\n\nIn March 1916, the newly 'doubled' AIF began sailing for France and the Western Front. From then until 1918 the battalion was heavily involved in operations against the German Army.\n\nThe battalion's first major action in France was at Pozieres in the Somme valley in July 1916, where the AIF Divisions engaged (1st 2nd and 4th) formed the right flank of the British front. The 1st Division was committed to the attack on Pozieres village from 23 July, involving the reduction of the ‘Gibraltar’ blockhouse among other tasks. The enemy shelling was relentless and casualties mounted at a horrifying rate. Once the ‘Windmill’ was captured by the 2nd Division on 4th August and consolidated by the 4th Division, the direction of the Australian assault switched to Mouquet Farm, with the 1st Division leading once again. The aim was to outflank Thiepval, the main impediment and key objective of the British advance. The AIF Divisions had fought themselves to a standstill over five weeks; 23,000 casualties of whom 5,0000 were killed.\n\nAfter Pozieres the battalion fought at Ypres in Flanders then returning to the Somme for winter.\n\n1917 began with a German consolidation of their Front Line and an orderly withdrawal through what were called 'The Outpost Villages' through which they conducted a delaying defence. The AIF was tasked to follow this up and a series of engagements ensued, culminating in April with the first of two attacks on Bullecourt. First Bullecourt was an exclusively 4th Division attack which although successful in breaking in to the German line was not adequately supported and it subsequently failed. Second Bullecourt followed in May and involved the 1st 2nd and 5th Divisions. Tactically it was very similar to First Bullecourt with a break-in being achieved, the tanks failing - again - and inadequate artillery support because of difficulties getting the guns far enough forward. From a casualty perspective, it was Pozieres all over again.\n\nThe 1st Division was reconstituted and reinforced during the period May -end July, when all of the AIF (for the first time including the 3rd Division) was committed to the Third Ypres campaign. The 1st Division was committed to fighting at Menin Road in late September 1917 and at Broodseinde Ridge on 4th October. The Third Ypres campaign bogged down in misery of 1st and 2nd Passchendaele in late October and November.\n\nThe Battalion helped to repel the German Spring Offensive in March - April 1918 in Flanders. The AIF had been sent south to bolster the British 5th Army which was crumbling io front of the German onslaught.\n\nThen it was realised that an attack was to be made in Flanders as part of ‘Operation Georgette’, towards the rail head of Hazebrouk, so the 1st Division was rushed back to be told by British General Harrington CoS British 2nd Army, on arrival at Hazebrouk station, that they (the 1st Division) were the only formed body of troops between here and the Channel Ports (Calais and Bolougne).\n\nThey became a rallying point around which other troops consolidated. and the Operation Georgette attacks were blunted. As a result, the Battle Honours Lys Hazebrouck and Kemmel were awarded.\n\nThe troops of the 1st Division were later transferred south to the Somme once again to take its place in the Australian Corps consolidated under General Monash’s command, and to take part in the Great Allied offensive, the \"Last Hundred Days\" campaign beginning on the 8th August 1918.\n\nThe 1st Division started the Amiens offensive in reserve but was later committed to the left flank along the Somme, taking part in actions around Chipilly and Chuignes across the Somme towards Bapaume securing the right flank of the British Army while it advanced on Bapaume. It also allowed the 3rd Australian Division to cross the Somme and secure the Australian Corps northern flank for the attack on Mont St Quentin.\n\nThe First Division finished its last phase of combat operations in the vicinity of Epehy on the approaches to the Hindenburg Line. After the 2nd Division attack on the Beaurevoir Line at Montbrehain on the 5th October, the AIF was withdrawn from the line to reinforce and refit following the accumulated losses it had sustained since 8th August.\n\nhe 2nd Division attack on the Beaurevoir Line at Montbrehain on the 5th October, the AIF was withdrawn from the line to reinforce and refit following the accumulated losses it had sustained since 8th August.\n\nUnit History\n\nAustin, R.J.
