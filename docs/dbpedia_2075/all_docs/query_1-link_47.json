        "meta_description": "Abstract. Surface melting over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) may impact the\nstability of ice shelves and thus the rate at which grounded ice is\ndischarged into the ocean. Energy and mass balance models are needed to\nunderstand how climatic change and atmospheric circulation variability drive\ncurrent and future melting. In this study, we evaluate the regional climate\nmodel MAR over the AP at a 10âkm spatial resolution between 1999 and 2009, a\nperiod when active microwave data from the QuikSCAT mission is available.\nThis model has been validated extensively over Greenland, has is applied here\nto the AP at a high resolution and for a relatively long time period (full\noutputs are available to 2014). We find that melting in the northeastern AP,\nthe focus area of this study, can be initiated both by sporadic westerly\nfÃ¶hn flow over the AP mountains and by northerly winds advecting warm air\nfrom lower latitudes. A comparison of MAR with satellite and automatic\nweather station (AWS) data reveals that satellite estimates show greater melt\nfrequency, a larger melt extent, and a quicker expansion to peak melt extent\nthan MAR in the centre and east of the Larsen C ice shelf. These differences\nare reduced in the north and west of the ice shelf, where the comparison with\nsatellite data suggests that MAR is accurately capturing melt produced by\nwarm westerly winds. MAR shows an overall warm bias and a cool bias at\ntemperatures above 0ââC as well as fewer warm, strong westerly winds\nthan reported by AWS stations located on the eastern edge of the Larsen C ice\nshelf, suggesting that the underestimation of melt in this region may be the\nproduct of limited eastward flow. At higher resolutions (5âkm), MAR shows a\nfurther increase in wind biases and a decrease in meltwater production. We\nconclude that non-hydrostatic models at spatial resolutions better than 5âkm\nare needed to better-resolve the effects of fÃ¶hn winds on the eastern\nedges of the Larsen C ice shelf.",

Earth system models (ESMs) are a valuable tool for these estimates but typically run at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we present an evaluation of the variable-resolution CESM2 (VR-CESM2) for the first time with a grid designed for enhanced spatial resolution over Antarctica to achieve the high resolution of regional climate models while preserving the two-way interactions of ESMs.\n\nAntarctic surface climate and surface mass balance in the Community Earth System Model versionÂ 2 during the satellite era and into the future (1979â2100)\n\nDevon Dunmire, Jan T.

The representation of Antarctica in ESMs is important because it can inform projections of the ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise. Here, we compare output of Antarctica's surface climate from an ESM with observations to understand strengths and weaknesses within the model.\n\nSupraglacial lake bathymetry automatically derived from ICESat-2 constraining lake depth estimates from multi-source satellite imagery\n\nRajashree Tri Datta and Bert Wouters\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5115–5132, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5115-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5115-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ICESat-2 laser altimeter can detect the surface and bottom of a supraglacial lake. We introduce the Watta algorithm, automatically calculating lake surface, corrected bottom, and (sub-)surface ice at high resolution adapting to signal strength. ICESat-2 depths constrain full lake depths of 46 lakes over Jakobshavn glacier using multiple sources of imagery, including very high-resolution Planet imagery, used for the first time to extract supraglacial lake depths empirically using ICESat-2.\n\nContrasting regional variability of buried meltwater extent over 2 years across the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nDevon Dunmire, Alison F.

For 2018 and 2019, we compare areal extent of buried lakes. We find greater buried lake extent in 2019, especially in northern Greenland, which we attribute to late-summer surface melt and high autumn temperatures. We also provide evidence that buried lakes form via different processes across Greenland.\n\nThe 32-year record-high surface melt in 2019/2020 on the northern George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nAlison F.

However, the stability of ice shelves is vulnerable to meltwater lakes that form on their surfaces during the summer. This study focuses on the northern George VI Ice Shelf on the western side of the AP, which had an exceptionally long and extensive melt season in 2019/2020 compared to the previous 31 seasons.\n\nEvaluation of the CMIP5 models in the aim of regional modelling of the Antarctic surface mass balance\n\nC. Agosta, X. Fettweis, and R. Datta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 2311–2321, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-2311-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-2311-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimates of the Antarctic surface mass balance with regional climate models (RCMs) require proper fields for forcing; hence we evaluate 41 CMIP5 climate models over Antarctica and include six reanalyses. Most of the models are biased compared to ERA-Interim, ACCESS1-3 being the best choice for forcing RCMs. Climate change is less sensitive to global warming than it is to the present-day simulated sea ice and to the feedback between sea-ice decrease and temperature increase around Antarctica.\n\nInclusion of the ECMWF ecRad radiation scheme (v1.5.0) in the MAR model (v3.14), regional evaluation for Belgium and assessment of surface shortwave spectral fluxes at Uccle observatory\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois Grailet, Robin J. Hogan, Nicolas Ghilain, Xavier Fettweis, and Marilaure GrÃ©goire\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1858,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1858, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe MAR model is a regional climate model used for weather forecasting and studying the climate over various regions. This paper presents an update of MAR thanks to which it can decompose solar radiation into various ranges. In particular, MAR can now simulate precisely solar radiation in the ultraviolet and photosynthesis ranges, both being critical to human health and ecosystems. As a first application of this new capability, this paper presents a method for predicting UV indices with MAR.\n\nFirst results of the polar regional climate model RACMO2.4\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, Srinidhi N. Gadde, Maurice van Tiggelen, Tijmen van der Drift, Erik van Meijgaard, Lambertus H. van Ulft, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-895,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-895, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new version of the polar regional climate model RACMO, version 2.4p1, and show first results for Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic. We provide an overview of all changes and investigate the impact that they have on the climate of polar regions. By comparing the results with observations and the output from the previous model version, we show that the model performs well regarding the surface mass balance of the ice sheets and near-surface climate.\n\nUnderstanding the drivers of near-surface winds in AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nCÃ©cile Davrinche, AnaÃ¯s Orsi, CÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, and Christoph Kittel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2239–2256, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2239-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2239-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal surface winds in Antarctica are amongst the strongest winds on Earth. They are either driven by the cooling of the surface air mass by the ice sheet (katabatic) or by large-scale pressure systems. Here we compute the relative contribution of these drivers. We find that seasonal variations in the wind speed come from the katabatic acceleration, but, at a 3-hourly timescale, none of the large-scale or katabatic accelerations can be considered as the main driver.\n\nFirn air content changes on Antarctic ice shelves under three future warming scenarios\n\nSanne B. M. Veldhuijsen, Willem Jan van de Berg, Peter Kuipers Munneke, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1983–1999, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1983-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1983-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the IMAU firn densification model to simulate the 21st-century evolution of Antarctic firn air content. Ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula and the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf in Dronning Maud Land are particularly vulnerable to total firn air content (FAC) depletion. Our results also underline the potentially large vulnerability of low-accumulation ice shelves to firn air depletion through ice slab formation.\n\nAbrupt excursions in water vapor isotopic variability at the Pointe Benedicte observatory on Amsterdam Island\n\nAmaelle Landais, CÃ©cile Agosta, FranÃ§oise Vimeux, Olivier Magand, Cyrielle Solis, Alexandre Cauquoin, Niels Dutrievoz, Camille Risi, Christophe Leroy-Dos Santos, Elise FourrÃ©, Olivier Cattani, Olivier Jossoud, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Minster, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Mathieu Casado, AurÃ©lien Dommergue, Yann Bertrand, and Martin Werner\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 4611–4634, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4611-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-4611-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have monitored water vapor isotopes since January 2020 on Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean. We show 11 periods associated with abrupt negative excursions of water vapor δ18Ο. Six of these events show a decrease in gaseous elemental mercury, suggesting subsidence of air from a higher altitude. Accurately representing the water isotopic signal during these cold fronts is a real challenge for the atmospheric components of Earth system models equipped with water isotopes.\n\nModelling snowpack on ice surfaces with the ORCHIDEE land surface model: Application to the Greenland ice sheet\n\nSylvie Charbit, Christophe Dumas, Fabienne Maignan, Catherine OttlÃ©, Nina Raoult, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-285,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-285, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evolution of the Greenland ice sheet is highly dependent on surface melting and therefore on the processes operating at the snow-atmosphere interface and within the snow cover. Here we present new developments to apply a snow model to the Greenland ice sheet. The performance of this model is analysed in terms of its ability to simulate ablation processes. Our analysis shows that the model performs well when compared with the MAR regional polar atmospheric model.\n\nCoupling MAR (ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional) with PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model) mitigates the positive meltâelevation feedback\n\nAlison Delhasse, Johanna Beckmann, Christoph Kittel, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 633–651, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAiming to study the long-term influence of an extremely warm climate in the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea level rise, a new regional atmosphere–ice sheet model setup was established. The coupling, explicitly considering the melt–elevation feedback, is compared to an offline method to consider this feedback. We highlight mitigation of the feedback due to local changes in atmospheric circulation with changes in surface topography, making the offline correction invalid on the margins.\n\nRecent warming trends of the Greenland ice sheet documented by historical firn and ice temperature observations and machine learning\n\nBaptiste Vandecrux, Robert S.

Smeets, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Max Brils, Peter L. Langen, Ruth Mottram, and Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 609–631, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-609-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-609-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow fast is the Greenland ice sheet warming? In this study, we compiled 4500+ temperature measurements at 10 m below the ice sheet surface (T10m) from 1912 to 2022. We trained a machine learning model on these data and reconstructed T10m for the ice sheet during 1950–2022. After a slight cooling during 1950–1985, the ice sheet warmed at a rate of 0.7 °C per decade until 2022. Climate models showed mixed results compared to our observations and underestimated the warming in key regions.\n\nCloud- and ice-albedo feedbacks drive greater Greenland Ice Sheet sensitivity to warming in CMIP6 than in CMIP5\n\nIdunn Aamnes Mostue, Stefan Hofer, Trude Storelvmo, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 475–488, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe latest generation of climate models (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 – CMIP6) warm more over Greenland and the Arctic and thus also project a larger mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) compared to the previous generation of climate models (CMIP5). Our work suggests for the first time that part of the greater mass loss in CMIP6 over the GrIS is driven by a difference in the surface mass balance sensitivity from a change in cloud representation in the CMIP6 models.\n\nAdvancing Arctic sea ice remote sensing with AI and deep learning: now and future\n\nWenwen Li, Chia-Yu Hsu, and Marco Tedesco\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2831,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2831, 2024\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis review paper fills a knowledge gap in comprehensive literature review at the junction of AI-Arctic sea ice research. We provide a fine-grained review of AI applications in a variety of sea ice research domains. Based on these analyses, we point out exciting opportunities where the Arctic sea ice community can continue benefiting from cutting-edge AI. These future research directions will foster the continuous growth of the Arctic sea ice–AI research community.\n\nOn the importance of the humidity flux for the surface mass balance in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nLaura J. Dietrich, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Sonja Wahl, Anne-Katrine Faber, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 289–305, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-289-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-289-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe contribution of the humidity flux to the surface mass balance in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet is uncertain. Here, we evaluate the regional climate model MAR using a multi-annual dataset of eddy covariance measurements and bulk estimates of the humidity flux. The humidity flux largely contributes to the summer surface mass balance (SMB) in the accumulation zone, indicating its potential importance for the annual SMB in a warming climate.\n\nControl of the temperature signal in Antarctic proxies by snowfall dynamics\n\nAymeric P. M. Servettaz, CÃ©cile Agosta, Christoph Kittel, and AnaÃ¯s J. Orsi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5373–5389, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5373-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5373-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt has been previously observed in polar regions that the atmospheric temperature is warmer during precipitation events. Here, we use a regional atmospheric model to quantify the temperature changes associated with snowfall events across Antarctica. We show that more intense snowfall is statistically associated with a warmer temperature anomaly compared to the seasonal average, with the largest anomalies seen in winter. This bias may affect water isotopes in ice cores deposited during snowfall.\n\nFrom atmospheric water isotopes measurement to firn core interpretation in AdÃ©lie Land: a case study for isotope-enabled atmospheric models in Antarctica\n\nChristophe Leroy-Dos Santos, Elise FourrÃ©, CÃ©cile Agosta, Mathieu Casado, Alexandre Cauquoin, Martin Werner, Benedicte Minster, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Olivier Jossoud, Leila Petit, and AmaÃ«lle Landais\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5241–5254, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5241-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5241-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the face of global warming, understanding the changing water cycle and temperatures in polar regions is crucial. These factors directly impact the balance of ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic. By studying the composition of water vapor, we gain insights into climate variations. Our 2-year study at Dumont d’Urville station, Adélie Land, offers valuable data to refine models. Additionally, we demonstrate how modeling aids in interpreting signals from ice core samples in the region.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nA computationally efficient statistically downscaled 100 m resolution Greenland product from the regional climate model MAR\n\nMarco Tedesco, Paolo Colosio, Xavier Fettweis, and Guido Cervone\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5061–5074, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5061-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5061-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a technique to improve the outputs of a model that calculates the gain and loss of Greenland and consequently its contribution to sea level rise. Our technique generates “sharper” images of the maps generated by the model to better understand and quantify where losses occur. This has implications for improving models, understanding what drives the contributions of Greenland to sea level rise, and more.\n\nSpatially heterogeneous effect of climate warming on the Arctic land ice\n\nDamien Maure, Christoph Kittel, Clara Lambin, Alison Delhasse, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4645–4659, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4645-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4645-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the Earth. Studies have already shown that Greenland and the Canadian Arctic are experiencing a record increase in melting rates, while Svalbard has been relatively less impacted. Looking at those regions but also extending the study to Iceland and the Russian Arctic archipelagoes, we see a heterogeneity in the melting-rate response to the Arctic warming, with the Russian archipelagoes experiencing lower melting rates than other regions.\n\nA new model for supraglacial hydrology evolution and drainage for the Greenland Ice Sheet (SHED v1.0)\n\nPrateek Gantayat, Alison F. Banwell, Amber A. Leeson, James M. Lea, Dorthe Petersen, Noel Gourmelen, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nGeosci.

This model simulates surface meltwater routing, meltwater drainage, supraglacial lake (SGL) overflow, and formation of lake ice. The model was able to reproduce 80 % of observed lake locations and provides a good match between the observed and modelled temporal evolution of SGLs.\n\nHow well can satellite altimetry and firn models resolve Antarctic firn thickness variations?\n\nMaria T.

Precise knowledge of these variations is important for the detection of any long-term climatic trends in AIS surface elevation. We present a new product that spatially resolves these height variations over the period 1992–2017. The product combines the strengths of atmospheric modeling results and satellite altimetry measurements.\n\nSensitivity of the MAR regional climate model snowpack to the parameterization of the assimilation of satellite-derived wet-snow masks on the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nThomas Dethinne, Quentin Glaude, Ghislain Picard, Christoph Kittel, Patrick Alexander, Anne Orban, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4267–4288, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the sensitivity of the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) to the assimilation of wet-snow occurrence estimated by remote sensing datasets. The assimilation is performed by nudging the MAR snowpack temperature. The data assimilation is performed over the Antarctic Peninsula for the 2019–2021 period. The results show an increase in the melt production (+66.7 %) and a decrease in surface mass balance (−4.5 %) of the model for the 2019–2020 melt season.\n\nSentinel-1 detection of perennial firn aquifers in the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nLena G.

In order to detect the presence of such firn aquifers over large scales, satellite remote sensing is needed. In this paper, we present our new detection method using radar satellite data as well as the results for the whole Antarctic Peninsula. Firn aquifers are found in the north and northwest of the peninsula, in agreement with locations predicted by models.\n\nEvaluating the impact of enhanced horizontal resolution over the Antarctic domain using a variable-resolution Earth system model\n\nRajashree Tri Datta, Adam Herrington, Jan T.

Earth system models (ESMs) are a valuable tool for these estimates but typically run at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we present an evaluation of the variable-resolution CESM2 (VR-CESM2) for the first time with a grid designed for enhanced spatial resolution over Antarctica to achieve the high resolution of regional climate models while preserving the two-way interactions of ESMs.\n\nMass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 1992 to 2020\n\nInÃ¨s N.

Here, we present a new record of the Earthâs polar ice sheet mass balance produced by aggregating 50 satellite-based estimates of ice sheet mass change. This new assessment shows that the ice sheets have lost (7.5 x 1012) t of ice between 1992 and 2020, contributing 21 mm to sea level rise.\n\nCharacteristics of the 1979â2020 Antarctic firn layer simulated with IMAU-FDM v1.2A\n\nSanne B.

Veldhuijsen, Willem Jan van de Berg, Max Brils, Peter Kuipers Munneke, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1675–1696, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1675-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1675-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn is the transition of snow to glacier ice and covers 99 % of the Antarctic ice sheet. Knowledge about the firn layer and its variability is important, as it impacts satellite-based estimates of ice sheet mass change. Also, firn contains pores in which nearly all of the surface melt is retained. Here, we improve a semi-empirical firn model and simulate the firn characteristics for the period 1979–2020. We evaluate the performance with field and satellite measures and test its sensitivity.\n\nEvaluating Greenland surface-mass-balance and firn-densification data using ICESat-2 altimetry\n\nBenjamin E. Smith, Brooke Medley, Xavier Fettweis, Tyler Sutterley, Patrick Alexander, David Porter, and Marco Tedesco\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 789–808, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-789-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-789-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use repeated satellite measurements of the height of the Greenland ice sheet to learn about how three computational models of snowfall, melt, and snow compaction represent actual changes in the ice sheet. We find that the models do a good job of estimating how the parts of the ice sheet near the coast have changed but that two of the models have trouble representing surface melt for the highest part of the ice sheet. This work provides suggestions for how to better model snowmelt.\n\nSnow stratigraphy observations from Operation IceBridge surveys in Alaska using S and C band airborne ultra-wideband FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar\n\nJilu Li, Fernando Rodriguez-Morales, Xavier Fettweis, Oluwanisola Ibikunle, Carl Leuschen, John Paden, Daniel Gomez-Garcia, and Emily Arnold\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 175–193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlaskan glaciers' loss of ice mass contributes significantly to ocean surface rise. It is important to know how deeply and how much snow accumulates on these glaciers to comprehend and analyze the glacial mass loss process. We reported the observed seasonal snow depth distribution from our radar data taken in Alaska in 2018 and 2021, developed a method to estimate the annual snow accumulation rate at Mt. Wrangell caldera, and identified transition zones from wet-snow zones to ablation zones.\n\nThe surface energy balance during foehn events at Joyce Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica\n\nMarte G.

We study these dry and warm winds at Joyce Glacier and show they are caused by a different mechanism than that found for nearby valleys, demonstrating the complex interaction of large-scale winds with the mountains in the MDV. We find that foehn winds increase sublimation of ice, increase heating from the atmosphere, and increase the occurrence and rates of melt.\n\nAntarctic surface climate and surface mass balance in the Community Earth System Model versionÂ 2 during the satellite era and into the future (1979â2100)\n\nDevon Dunmire, Jan T.

The representation of Antarctica in ESMs is important because it can inform projections of the ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise. Here, we compare output of Antarctica's surface climate from an ESM with observations to understand strengths and weaknesses within the model.\n\nAssessing bare-ice albedo simulated by MAR over the Greenland ice sheet (2000â2021) and implications for meltwater production estimates\n\nRaf M. Antwerpen, Marco Tedesco, Xavier Fettweis, Patrick Alexander, and Willem Jan van de Berg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4185–4199, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice on Greenland has been melting more rapidly over the last few years. Most of this melt comes from the exposure of ice when the overlying snow melts. This ice is darker than snow and absorbs more sunlight, leading to more melt. It remains challenging to accurately simulate the brightness of the ice. We show that the color of ice simulated by ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional (MAR) is too bright. We then show that this means that MAR may underestimate how fast the Greenland ice is melting.\n\nSentinel-1 detection of seasonal and perennial firn aquifers in the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nLena G. Buth, Bert Wouters, Sanne B. M. Veldhuijsen, Stef Lhermitte, Peter Kuipers Munneke, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-127,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-127, 2022\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLiquid meltwater which is stored in air bubbles in the compacted snow near the surface of Antarctica can affect ice shelf stability. In order to detect the presence of such firn aquifers over large scales, satellite remote sensing is needed. In this paper, we present our new detection method using radar satellite data as well as the results for the whole Antarctic Peninsula. Firn aquifers are found in the north and northwest of the peninsula, in agreement with locations predicted by models.\n\nImproved representation of the contemporary Greenland ice sheet firn layer by IMAU-FDM v1.2G\n\nMax Brils, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Willem Jan van de Berg, and Michiel van den Broeke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7121–7138, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7121-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7121-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn covers the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and can temporarily prevent mass loss. Here, we present the latest version of our firn model, IMAU-FDM, with an application to the GrIS. We improved the density of fallen snow, the firn densification rate and the firn's thermal conductivity. This leads to a higher air content and 10 m temperatures. Furthermore we investigate three case studies and find that the updated model shows greater variability and an increased sensitivity in surface elevation.\n\nClouds drive differences in future surface melt over the Antarctic ice shelves\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, Stefan Hofer, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Ella Gilbert, Louis Le Toumelin, Ãtienne Vignon, Hubert GallÃ©e, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2655–2669, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel projections suggest large differences in future Antarctic surface melting even for similar greenhouse gas scenarios and warming rates. We show that clouds containing a larger amount of liquid water lead to stronger melt. As surface melt can trigger the collapse of the ice shelves (the safety band of the Antarctic Ice Sheet), clouds could be a major source of uncertainties in projections of sea level rise.\n\nHistorical and future weather data for dynamic building simulations in Belgium using the regional climate model MAR: typical and extreme meteorological year and heatwaves\n\nSÃ©bastienâââââââ Doutreloup, Xavier Fettweis, Ramin Rahif, Essam Elnagar, Mohsen S. Pourkiaei, Deepak Amaripadath, and Shady Attia\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 3039–3051, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3039-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3039-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis data set provides historical (1980–2014) and future (2015–2100) weather data for 12 cities in Belgium. This data set is intended for architects or building or energy designers. In particular, it makes available to all users hourly open-access weather data according to certain standards to recreate a Typical and an Extreme Meteorological Year. In addition, it provides hourly data on heatwaves from 1980 to 2100. Weather data were produced from the outputs of the MAR model simulations.\n\nSensitivity of Antarctic surface climate to a new spectral snow albedo and radiative transfer scheme in RACMO2.3p3\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1071–1089, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1071-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1071-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we improve the regional climate model RACMO2 and investigate the climate of Antarctica. We have implemented a new radiative transfer and snow albedo scheme and do several sensitivity experiments. When fully tuned, the results compare well with observations and snow temperature profiles improve. Moreover, small changes in the albedo and the investigated processes can lead to a strong overestimation of melt, locally leading to runoff and a reduced surface mass balance.\n\nImproving surface melt estimation over the Antarctic Ice Sheet using deep learning: a proof of concept over the Larsen Ice Shelf\n\nZhongyang Hu, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Stef Lhermitte, Maaike Izeboud, and Michiel van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5639–5658, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5639-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5639-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctica is shrinking, and part of the mass loss is caused by higher temperatures leading to more snowmelt. We use computer models to estimate the amount of melt, but this can be inaccurate – specifically in the areas with the most melt. This is because the model cannot account for small, darker areas like rocks or darker ice. Thus, we trained a computer using artificial intelligence and satellite images that showed these darker areas. The model computed an improved estimate of melt.\n\nSupraglacial lake bathymetry automatically derived from ICESat-2 constraining lake depth estimates from multi-source satellite imagery\n\nRajashree Tri Datta and Bert Wouters\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5115–5132, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5115-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5115-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ICESat-2 laser altimeter can detect the surface and bottom of a supraglacial lake. We introduce the Watta algorithm, automatically calculating lake surface, corrected bottom, and (sub-)surface ice at high resolution adapting to signal strength. ICESat-2 depths constrain full lake depths of 46 lakes over Jakobshavn glacier using multiple sources of imagery, including very high-resolution Planet imagery, used for the first time to extract supraglacial lake depths empirically using ICESat-2.\n\nGreenland ice sheet mass balance from 1840 through next week\n\nKenneth D. Mankoff, Xavier Fettweis, Peter L. Langen, Martin Stendel, Kristian K. Kjeldsen, Nanna B. Karlsson, Brice NoÃ«l, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Anne Solgaard, William Colgan, Jason E. Box, Sebastian B. Simonsen, Michalea D. King, Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m, Signe Bech Andersen, and Robert S. Fausto\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 5001–5025, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-5001-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-5001-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe estimate the daily mass balance and its components (surface, marine, and basal mass balance) for the Greenland ice sheet. Our time series begins in 1840 and has annual resolution through 1985 and then daily from 1986 through next week. Results are operational (updated daily) and provided for the entire ice sheet or by commonly used regions or sectors. This is the first input–output mass balance estimate to include the basal mass balance.\n\nWhat is the surface mass balance of Antarctica? An intercomparison of regional climate model estimates\n\nRuth Mottram, Nicolaj Hansen, Christoph Kittel, J. Melchior van Wessem, CÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Fredrik Boberg, Willem Jan van de Berg, Xavier Fettweis, Alexandra Gossart, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, Erik van Meijgaard, Andrew Orr, Tony Phillips, Stuart Webster, Sebastian B. Simonsen, and Niels Souverijns\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3751–3784, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3751-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3751-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the calculated surface mass budget (SMB) of Antarctica in five different regional climate models. On average ~ 2000 Gt of snow accumulates annually, but different models vary by ~ 10 %, a difference equivalent to Â± 0.5 mm of global sea level rise. All models reproduce observed weather, but there are large differences in regional patterns of snowfall, especially in areas with very few observations, giving greater uncertainty in Antarctic mass budget than previously identified.\n\nSignificant additional Antarctic warming in atmospheric bias-corrected ARPEGE projections with respect to control run\n\nJulien Beaumet, Michel DÃ©quÃ©, Gerhard Krinner, CÃ©cile Agosta, Antoinette Alias, and Vincent Favier\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3615–3635, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3615-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3615-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use empirical run-time bias correction (also called flux correction) to correct the systematic errors of the ARPEGE atmospheric climate model. When applying the method to future climate projections, we found a lesser poleward shift and an intensification of the maximum of westerly winds present in the southern high latitudes. This yields a significant additional warming of +0.6 to +0.9 K of the Antarctic Ice Sheet with respect to non-corrected control projections using the RCP8.5 scenario.\n\nSensitivity of the surface energy budget to drifting snow as simulated by MAR in coastal Adelie Land, Antarctica\n\nLouis Le Toumelin, Charles Amory, Vincent Favier, Christoph Kittel, Stefan Hofer, Xavier Fettweis, Hubert GallÃ©e, and Vinay Kayetha\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3595–3614, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3595-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3595-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow is frequently eroded from the surface by the wind in Adelie Land (Antarctica) and suspended in the lower atmosphere. By performing model simulations, we show firstly that suspended snow layers interact with incoming radiation similarly to a near-surface cloud. Secondly, suspended snow modifies the atmosphere's thermodynamic structure and energy exchanges with the surface. Our results suggest snow transport by the wind should be taken into account in future model studies over the region.\n\nBrief communication: Reduction in the future Greenland ice sheet surface melt with the help of solar geoengineering\n\nXavier Fettweis, Stefan Hofer, Roland SÃ©fÃ©rian, Charles Amory, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Christoph Kittel, Charlotte Lang, Joris Van Bever, Florent Veillon, and Peter Irvine\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3013–3019, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3013-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3013-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWithout any reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions, the Greenland ice sheet surface mass loss can be brought in line with a medium-mitigation emissions scenario by reducing the solar downward flux at the top of the atmosphere by 1.5 %. In addition to reducing global warming, these solar geoengineering measures also dampen the well-known positive melt–albedo feedback over the ice sheet by 6 %. However, only stronger reductions in solar radiation could maintain a stable ice sheet in 2100.\n\nContrasting regional variability of buried meltwater extent over 2 years across the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nDevon Dunmire, Alison F. Banwell, Nander Wever, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, and Rajashree Tri Datta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2983–3005, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2983-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2983-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we automatically detect buried lakes (meltwater lakes buried below layers of snow) across the Greenland Ice Sheet, providing insight into a poorly studied meltwater feature. For 2018 and 2019, we compare areal extent of buried lakes. We find greater buried lake extent in 2019, especially in northern Greenland, which we attribute to late-summer surface melt and high autumn temperatures. We also provide evidence that buried lakes form via different processes across Greenland.\n\nSurface melting over the Greenland ice sheet derived from enhanced resolution passive microwave brightness temperatures (1979â2019)\n\nPaolo Colosio, Marco Tedesco, Roberto Ranzi, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2623–2646, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2623-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2623-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new satellite dataset to study the spatiotemporal evolution of surface melting over Greenland at an enhanced resolution of 3.125 km. Using meteorological data and the MAR model, we observe that a dynamic algorithm can best detect surface melting. We found that the melting season is elongating, the melt extent is increasing and that high-resolution data better describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the melting season, which is crucial to improve estimates of sea level rise.\n\nMapping the aerodynamic roughness of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface using ICESat-2: evaluation over the K-transect\n\nMaurice van Tiggelen, Paul C. J. P. Smeets, Carleen H. Reijmer, Bert Wouters, Jakob F. Steiner, Emile J. Nieuwstraten, Walter W. Immerzeel, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2601–2621, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2601-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2601-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a method to estimate the aerodynamic properties of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface using either UAV or ICESat-2 elevation data. We show that this new method is able to reproduce the important spatiotemporal variability in surface aerodynamic roughness, measured by the field observations. The new maps of surface roughness can be used in atmospheric models to improve simulations of surface turbulent heat fluxes and therefore surface energy and mass balance over rough ice worldwide.\n\nPerformance of MAR (v3.11) in simulating the drifting-snow climate and surface mass balance of AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nCharles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Louis Le Toumelin, CÃ©cile Agosta, Alison Delhasse, Vincent Favier, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3487–3510, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3487-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3487-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents recent developments in the drifting-snow scheme of the regional climate model MAR and its application to simulate drifting snow and the surface mass balance of AdÃ©lie Land in East Antarctica. The model is extensively described and evaluated against a multi-year drifting-snow dataset and surface mass balance estimates available in the area. The model sensitivity to input parameters and improvements over a previously published version are also assessed.\n\nSpectral attenuation coefficients from measurements of light transmission in bare ice on the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nMatthew G. Cooper, Laurence C. Smith, Asa K. Rennermalm, Marco Tedesco, Rohi Muthyala, Sasha Z. Leidman, Samiah E. Moustafa, and Jessica V. Fayne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1931–1953, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1931-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1931-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured sunlight transmitted into glacier ice to improve models of glacier ice melt and satellite measurements of glacier ice surfaces. We found that very small concentrations of impurities inside the ice increase absorption of sunlight, but the amount was small enough to enable an estimate of ice absorptivity. We confirmed earlier results that the absorption minimum is near 390 nm. We also found that a layer of highly reflective granular \"white ice\" near the surface reduces transmittance.\n\nImpact of updated radiative transfer scheme in snow and ice in RACMO2.3p3 on the surface mass and energy budget of the Greenland ice sheet\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1823–1844, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1823-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1823-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbsorption of solar radiation is often limited to the surface in regional climate models. Therefore, we have implemented a new radiative transfer scheme in the model RACMO2, which allows for internal heating and improves the surface reflectivity. Here, we evaluate its impact on the surface mass and energy budget and (sub)surface temperature, by using observations and the previous model version for the Greenland ice sheet. New results match better with observations and introduce subsurface melt.\n\nDiverging future surface mass balance between the Antarctic ice shelves and grounded ice sheet\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Stefan Hofer, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Charlotte Lang, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1215–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe future surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) will influence the ice dynamics and the contribution of the ice sheet to the sea level rise. We investigate the AIS sensitivity to different warmings using physical and statistical downscaling of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Our results highlight a contrasting effect between the grounded ice sheet (where the SMB is projected to increase) and ice shelves (where the future SMB depends on the emission scenario).\n\nPhysics-based SNOWPACK model improves representation of near-surface Antarctic snow and firn density\n\nEric Keenan, Nander Wever, Marissa Dattler, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Brooke Medley, Peter Kuipers Munneke, and Carleen Reijmer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1065–1085, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1065-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1065-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow density is required to convert observed changes in ice sheet volume into mass, which ultimately drives ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. However, snow properties respond dynamically to wind-driven redistribution. Here we include a new wind-driven snow density scheme into an existing snow model. Our results demonstrate an improved representation of snow density when compared to observations and can therefore be used to improve retrievals of ice sheet mass balance.\n\nThe 32-year record-high surface melt in 2019/2020 on the northern George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nAlison F. Banwell, Rajashree Tri Datta, Rebecca L. Dell, Mahsa Moussavi, Ludovic Brucker, Ghislain Picard, Christopher A. Shuman, and Laura A. Stevens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 909–925, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-909-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-909-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves are thick floating layers of glacier ice extending from the glaciers on land that buttress much of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and help to protect it from losing ice to the ocean. However, the stability of ice shelves is vulnerable to meltwater lakes that form on their surfaces during the summer. This study focuses on the northern George VI Ice Shelf on the western side of the AP, which had an exceptionally long and extensive melt season in 2019/2020 compared to the previous 31 seasons.\n\nAn exploratory modelling study of perennial firn aquifers in the Antarctic Peninsula for the period 1979â2016\n\nJ. Melchior van Wessem, Christian R. Steger, Nander Wever, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 695–714, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-695-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-695-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the first modelled estimates of perennial firn aquifers (PFAs) in Antarctica. PFAs are subsurface meltwater bodies that do not refreeze in winter due to the isolating effects of the snow they are buried underneath. They were first identified in Greenland, but conditions for their existence are also present in the Antarctic Peninsula. These PFAs can have important effects on meltwater retention, ice shelf stability, and, consequently, sea level rise.\n\nFuture surface mass balance and surface melt in the Amundsen sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nMarion Donat-Magnin, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Christoph Kittel, CÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Hubert GallÃ©e, Gerhard Krinner, and Mondher Chekki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 571–593, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-571-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-571-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the West Antarctic climate in 2100 under increasing greenhouse gases. Future accumulation over the ice sheet increases, which reduces sea level changing rate. Surface ice-shelf melt rates increase until 2100. Some ice shelves experience a lot of liquid water at their surface, which indicates potential ice-shelf collapse. In contrast, no liquid water is found over other ice shelves due to huge amounts of snowfall that bury liquid water, favouring refreezing and ice-shelf stability.\n\nLong-term surface energy balance of the western Greenland Ice Sheet and the role of large-scale circulation variability\n\nBaojuan Huai, Michiel R. van den Broeke, and Carleen H. Reijmer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 4181–4199, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4181-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4181-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the surface energy balance (SEB) of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) using a SEB model forced with observations from automatic weather stations (AWSs). We correlate ERA5 with AWSs to show a signiï¬cant positive correlation of GrIS summer surface temperature and melt with the Greenland Blocking Index and weaker and opposite correlations with the North Atlantic Oscillation. This analysis may help explain melting patterns in the GrIS with respect to circulation anomalies.\n\nThe influence of fÃ¶hn winds on annual and seasonal surface melt on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica\n\nJenny V. Turton, AmÃ©lie Kirchgaessner, Andrew N. Ross, John C. King, and Peter Kuipers Munneke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 4165–4180, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4165-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4165-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFÃ¶hn winds are warm and dry downslope winds in the lee of a mountain range, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. FÃ¶hn winds heat the ice of the Larsen C Ice Shelf at the base of the mountains and promote more melting than during non-fÃ¶hn periods in spring, summer and autumn in both model output and observations. Especially in spring, when they are most frequent, fÃ¶hn winds can extend the melt season by over a month and cause a similar magnitude of melting to that observed in summer.\n\nContrasting seasonal changes in total and intense precipitation in the European Alps fromÂ 1903 toÂ 2010\n\nMartin MÃ©nÃ©goz, Evgenia Valla, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Juliette Blanchet, Julien Beaumet, Bruno Wilhelm, Hubert GallÃ©e, Xavier Fettweis, Samuel Morin, and Sandrine Anquetin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5355–5377, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5355-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5355-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study investigates precipitation changes in the Alps, using observations and a 7 km resolution climate simulation over 1900–2010. An increase in mean precipitation is found in winter over the Alps, whereas a drying occurred in summer in the surrounding plains. A general increase in the daily annual maximum of precipitation is evidenced (20 to 40 % per century), suggesting an increase in extreme events that is significant only when considering long time series, typically 50 to 80 years.\n\nGreenland liquid water discharge from 1958 through 2019\n\nKenneth D. Mankoff, Brice NoÃ«l, Xavier Fettweis, Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m, William Colgan, Ken Kondo, Kirsty Langley, Shin Sugiyama, Dirk van As, and Robert S. Fausto\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Temporal resolution is daily from 1959 through 2019. Spatial grid is ~ 100 m, resolving individual streams. In addition to discharge at outlets, we also provide the streams, outlets, and basin geospatial data, as well as a script to query and access the geospatial or time series discharge data from the data files.\n\nGrSMBMIP: intercomparison of the modelled 1980â2012 surface mass balance over the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nXavier Fettweis, Stefan Hofer, Uta Krebs-Kanzow, Charles Amory, Teruo Aoki, Constantijn J.

While the most complex (but expensive to compute) models remain the best, the faster/simpler models also compare reliably with observations and have biases of the same order as the regional models. Discrepancies in the trend over 2000–2012, however, suggest that large uncertainties remain in the modelled future SMB changes as they are highly impacted by the meltwater runoff biases over the current climate.\n\nThe firn meltwater Retention Model Intercomparison Project (RetMIP): evaluation of nine firn models at four weather station sites on the Greenland ice sheet\n\nBaptiste Vandecrux, Ruth Mottram, Peter L.

Box\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3785–3810, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3785-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3785-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the vast interior of the Greenland ice sheet, snow accumulates into a thick and porous layer called firn. Each summer, the firn retains part of the meltwater generated at the surface and buffers sea-level rise. In this study, we compare nine firn models traditionally used to quantify this retention at four sites and evaluate their performance against a set of in situ observations. We highlight limitations of certain model designs and give perspectives for future model development.\n\nEvaluation of a new snow albedo scheme for the Greenland ice sheet in the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2)\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, Stef Lhermitte, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3645–3662, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3645-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3645-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe reflectivity of sunlight, which is also known as albedo, is often inadequately modeled in regional climate models. Therefore, we have implemented a new snow and ice albedo scheme in the regional climate model RACMO2. In this study, we evaluate a new RACMO2 version for the Greenland ice sheet by using observations and the previous model version. RACMO2 output compares well with observations, and by including new processes we improve the ability of RACMO2 to make future climate projections.\n\nIntercomparison of surface meltwater routing models for the Greenland ice sheet and influence on subglacial effective pressures\n\nKang Yang, Aleah Sommers, Lauren C. Andrews, Laurence C. Smith, Xin Lu, Xavier Fettweis, and Manchun Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3349–3365, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3349-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3349-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study compares hourly supraglacial moulin discharge simulations from three surface meltwater routing models. Results show that these models are superior to simply using regional climate model runoff without routing, but different routing models, different-spatial-resolution DEMs, and parameterized seasonal evolution of supraglacial stream and river networks induce significant variability in diurnal moulin discharges and corresponding subglacial effective pressures.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

The results for two different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass until 2100, with contributions to sea-level rise of 90 Â± 50 mm and 32 Â± 17 mm for the high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) scenario, respectively.\n\nISMIP6 Antarctica: a multi-model ensemble of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the 21st century\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\nBayesian calibration of firn densification models\n\nVincent Verjans, Amber A. Leeson, Christopher Nemeth, C. Max Stevens, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Brice NoÃ«l, and Jan Melchior van Wessem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3017–3032, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3017-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3017-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheets are covered by a firn layer, which is the transition stage between fresh snow and ice. Accurate modelling of firn density properties is important in many glaciological aspects. Current models show disagreements, are mostly calibrated to match specific observations of firn density and lack thorough uncertainty analysis. We use a novel calibration method for firn models based on a Bayesian statistical framework, which results in improved model accuracy and in uncertainty evaluation.\n\nQuantifying spatiotemporal variability of glacier algal blooms and the impact on surface albedo in southwestern Greenland\n\nShujie Wang, Marco Tedesco, Patrick Alexander, Min Xu, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2687–2713, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2687-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2687-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacial algal blooms play a significant role in darkening the Greenland Ice Sheet during summertime. The dark pigments generated by glacial algae could substantially reduce the bare ice albedo and thereby enhance surface melt. We used satellite data to map the spatial distribution of glacial algae and characterized the seasonal growth pattern and interannual trends of glacial algae in southwestern Greenland. Our study is important for bridging microbial activities with ice sheet mass balance.\n\nExperimental protocol for sea level projections from ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet models\n\nSophie Nowicki, Heiko Goelzer, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Anthony J.

This paper describes the mission objectives, identifies the key contributions the CRISTAL mission will make, and presents a concept – as far as it is already defined – for the mission payload.\n\nRemapping of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance anomalies for large ensemble sea-level change projections\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Brice P. Y. NoÃ«l, Tamsin L. Edwards, Xavier Fettweis, Jonathan M. Gregory, William H. Lipscomb, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1747–1762, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture sea-level change projections with process-based ice sheet models are typically driven with surface mass balance forcing derived from climate models. In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the one used by the climate model. The proposed remapping method reproduces the original forcing data closely when applied to the original geometry and produces a physically meaningful forcing when applied to different modelled geometries.\n\nEvaluation of long-term Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent products\n\nColleen Mortimer, Lawrence Mudryk, Chris Derksen, Kari Luojus, Ross Brown, Richard Kelly, and Marco Tedesco\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1579–1594, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1579-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1579-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExisting stand-alone passive microwave SWE products have markedly different climatological SWE patterns compared to reanalysis-based datasets. The AMSR-E SWE has low spatial and temporal correlations with the four reanalysis-based products evaluated and GlobSnow and perform poorly in comparisons with snow transect data from Finland, Russia, and Canada. There is better agreement with in situ data when multiple SWE products, excluding the stand-alone passive microwave SWE products, are combined.\n\nBrief communication: CESM2 climate forcing (1950â2014) yields realistic Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance\n\nBrice NoÃ«l, Leonardus van Kampenhout, Willem Jan van de Berg, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Bert Wouters, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1425–1435, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1425-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1425-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a reconstruction of historical (1950–2014) surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet using the Community Earth System Model (CESM2; ~111 km) to force a high-resolution regional climate model (RACMO2; ~11 km), which is further refined to 1 km spatial resolution. For the first time, an Earth-system-model-based product, assimilating no observations, can reconstruct realistic historical ice sheet surface mass balance as well as the mass loss acceleration that started in the 1990s.\n\nUnprecedented atmospheric conditions (1948â2019) drive the 2019 exceptional melting season over the Greenland ice sheet\n\nMarco Tedesco and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1209–1223, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1209-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1209-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnprecedented atmospheric conditions occurring in the summer of 2019 over Greenland promoted new record or close-to-record values of mass loss. Summer of 2019 was characterized by an exceptional persistence of anticyclonic conditions that enhanced melting.\n\nExposure of real estate properties to the 2018Â Hurricane Florence flooding\n\nMarco Tedesco, Steven McAlpine, and Jeremy R. Porter\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 907–920, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-907-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-907-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the exposure of house property to extreme weather events is crucial to study their impact on economy. Here, we show that value of property exposed to Hurricane Florence in September 2018 was USD 52 billion vs. USD 10 billion that would have occurred at the beginning of the 19th century due to urban expansion that increased after 1950s and the increasing number of houses built near water, showing the importance of accounting for the distribution of new buildings in risk and exposure.\n\nTwenty-first century ocean forcing of the Greenland ice sheet for modelling of sea level contribution\n\nDonald A. Slater, Denis Felikson, Fiamma Straneo, Heiko Goelzer, Christopher M. Little, Mathieu Morlighem, Xavier Fettweis, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 985–1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in the ocean around Greenland play an important role in determining how much the ice sheet will contribute to global sea level over the coming century. However, capturing these links in models is very challenging. This paper presents a strategy enabling an ensemble of ice sheet models to feel the effect of the ocean for the first time and should therefore result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet's contribution to future sea level change.\n\nBrief communication: Evaluation of the near-surface climate in ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nAlison Delhasse, Christoph Kittel, Charles Amory, Stefan Hofer, Dirk van As, Robert S.

The aim was to evaluate the performance of ERA5 to simulate the near-surface climate of the Greenland Ice sheet (GrIS) against ERA-Interim and regional climate models with the help of in situ observations from the PROMICE dataset. We also highlighted that polar regional climate models are still a useful tool to study the GrIS climate compared to ERA5.\n\nCMIP5 model selection for ISMIP6 ice sheet model forcing: Greenland and Antarctica\n\nAlice Barthel, CÃ©cile Agosta, Christopher M. Little, Tore Hattermann, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Heiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Helene Seroussi, Fiammetta Straneo, and Thomas J.

We select models based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century.\n\nBrief communication: CMIP6 does not suggest any circulation change over Greenland in summer by 2100\n\nAlison Delhasse, Edward Hanna, Christoph Kittel, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-332,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-332, 2020\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSignificant melting events over Greenland ice sheet related to unusual atmospheric pattern in summer, as observed this summer 2019, are still not considered by the new generation of Earth-system models (CMIP6) and therefore the projected surface melt increase of the ice sheet is likely to be underestimated if such changes persist in the next decades.\n\nSensitivity of inverse glacial isostatic adjustment estimates over Antarctica\n\nMatthias O. Willen, Martin Horwath, Ludwig SchrÃ¶der, Andreas Groh, Stefan R. M.

Jourdain, Hubert GallÃ©e, Charles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Xavier Fettweis, Jonathan D. Wille, Vincent Favier, Amine Drira, and CÃ©cile Agosta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 229–249, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-229-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-229-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the interannual variability of the surface conditions over Antarctic glaciers is important for the identification of climate trends and climate predictions and to assess models. We simulate snow accumulation and surface melting in the Amundsen sector (West Antarctica) over 1979–2017. For all the glaciers, the interannual variability of summer snow accumulation and surface melting is driven by two distinct mechanisms related to variations in the Amundsen Sea Low strength and position.\n\nA module to convert spectral to narrowband snow albedo for use in climate models: SNOWBAL v1.2\n\nChristiaan T. van Dalum, Willem Jan van de Berg, Quentin Libois, Ghislain Picard, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 5157–5175, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-5157-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-5157-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models are often limited to relatively simple snow albedo schemes. Therefore, we have developed the SNOWBAL module to couple a climate model with a physically based wavelength dependent snow albedo model. Using SNOWBAL v1.2 to couple the snow albedo model TARTES with the regional climate model RACMO2 indicates a potential performance gain for the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nEffect of prescribed sea surface conditions on the modern and future Antarctic surface climate simulated by the ARPEGE atmosphere general circulation model\n\nJulien Beaumet, Michel DÃ©quÃ©, Gerhard Krinner, CÃ©cile Agosta, and Antoinette Alias\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 3023–3043, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3023-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3023-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe atmospheric model ARPEGE is used with a stretched grid in order to reach an average horizontal resolution of 35 km over Antarctica. Over 1981–2010, we forced the model with observed and modelled sea surface conditions (SSCs). For the late 21st century, we use original and bias-corrected sea surface conditions from RCP8.5 climate projections. We assess the impact of using direct or bias-corrected SSCs for the evolution of Antarctic climate and surface mass balance.\n\nEstimating Greenland tidewater glacier retreat driven by submarine melting\n\nDonald A. Slater, Fiamma Straneo, Denis Felikson, Christopher M. Little, Heiko Goelzer, Xavier Fettweis, and James Holte\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2489–2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ocean's influence on the retreat of Greenland's tidewater glaciers is a key factor determining future sea level. By considering observations of ~200 glaciers from 1960, we find a significant relationship between retreat and melting in the ocean. Projected forwards, this relationship estimates the future evolution of Greenland's tidewater glaciers and provides a practical and empirically validated way of representing ice–ocean interaction in large-scale models used to estimate sea level rise.\n\nGreenland Ice Sheet late-season melt: investigating multiscale drivers of K-transect events\n\nThomas J. Ballinger, Thomas L. Mote, Kyle Mattingly, Angela C. Bliss, Edward Hanna, Dirk van As, Melissa Prieto, Saeideh Gharehchahi, Xavier Fettweis, Brice NoÃ«l, Paul C. J. P. Smeets, Carleen H. Reijmer, Mads H. Ribergaard, and John Cappelen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2241–2257, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2241-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2241-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic sea ice and the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are melting later in the year due to a warming climate. Through analyses of weather station, climate model, and reanalysis data, physical links are evaluated between Baffin Bay open water duration and western GrIS melt conditions. We show that sub-Arctic air mass movement across this portion of the GrIS strongly influences late summer and autumn melt, while near-surface, off-ice winds inhibit westerly atmospheric heat transfer from Baffin Bay.\n\nDevelopment of physically based liquid water schemes for Greenland firn-densification models\n\nVincent Verjans, Amber A. Leeson, C. Max Stevens, Michael MacFerrin, Brice NoÃ«l, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1819–1842, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1819-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1819-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn models rely on empirical approaches for representing the percolation and refreezing of meltwater through the firn column. We develop liquid water schemes of different levels of complexity for firn models and compare their performances with respect to observations of density profiles from Greenland. Our results demonstrate that physically advanced water schemes do not lead to better agreement with density observations. Uncertainties in other processes contribute more to model discrepancy.\n\nAntarctic ice shelf thickness change from multimission lidar mapping\n\nTyler C. Sutterley, Thorsten Markus, Thomas A. Neumann, Michiel van den Broeke, J. Melchior van Wessem, and Stefan R. M. Ligtenberg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1801–1817, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1801-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1801-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost of the Antarctic ice sheet is fringed by ice shelves, floating extensions of ice that help to modulate the flow of the glaciers that float into them. We use airborne laser altimetry data to measure changes in ice thickness of ice shelves around West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. Each of our target ice shelves is susceptible to short-term changes in ice thickness. The method developed here provides a framework for processing NASA ICESat-2 data over ice shelves.\n\nRegional grid refinement in an Earth system model: impacts on the simulated Greenland surface mass balance\n\nLeonardus van Kampenhout, Alan M. Rhoades, Adam R. Herrington, Colin M. Zarzycki, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, William J. Sacks, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1547–1564, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1547-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1547-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new tool is evaluated in which the climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet are resolved at 55 and 28 km resolution, while the rest of the globe is modelled at ~110 km. The local refinement of resolution leads to improved accumulation (SMB > 0) compared to observations; however ablation (SMB < 0) is deteriorated in some regions. This is attributed to changes in cloud cover and a reduced effectiveness of a model-specific vertical downscaling technique.\n\nQuantifying the snowmeltâalbedo feedback at Neumayer Station, East Antarctica\n\nConstantijn L. Jakobs, Carleen H.

Meltwater can refreeze in the subsurface snow layers, thereby decreasing the surface albedo and hence allowing for more absorption of solar radiation. By implementing an albedo parameterisation, we show that this feedback accounts for a threefold increase in surface melt at Neumayer.\n\nIncreased Greenland melt triggered by large-scale, year-round cyclonic moisture intrusions\n\nMarilena Oltmanns, Fiammetta Straneo, and Marco Tedesco\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 815–825, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-815-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-815-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining reanalysis, weather station and satellite data, we show that increases in surface melt over Greenland are initiated by large-scale precipitation events year-round. Estimates from a regional climate model suggest that the initiated melting more than doubled between 1988 and 2012, amounting to ~28 % of the overall melt and revealing that, despite the involved mass gain, precipitation events are contributing to the ice sheet's decline.\n\nFour decades of Antarctic surface elevation changes from multi-mission satellite altimetry\n\nLudwig SchrÃ¶der, Martin Horwath, Reinhard Dietrich, Veit Helm, Michiel R. van den Broeke, and Stefan R. M. Ligtenberg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 427–449, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-427-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-427-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an approach to combine measurements of seven satellite altimetry missions over the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Our resulting monthly grids of elevation changes between 1978 and 2017 provide unprecedented details of the long-term and interannual variation. Derived mass changes agree well with contemporaneous data of surface mass balance and satellite gravimetry and show which regions were responsible for the significant accelerations of mass loss in recent years.\n\nAssessment of the Greenland ice sheetâatmosphere feedbacks for the next century with a regional atmospheric model coupled to an ice sheet model\n\nSÃ©bastien Le clec'h, Sylvie Charbit, AurÃ©lien Quiquet, Xavier Fettweis, Christophe Dumas, Masa Kageyama, Coraline Wyard, and Catherine Ritz\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 373–395, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-373-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-373-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea-level rise in response to atmospheric changes is important but remains challenging. For the first time a full representation of the feedbacks between a GrIS model and a regional atmospheric model was implemented. The authors highlight the fundamental need for representing the GrIS topography change feedbacks with respect to the atmospheric component face to the strong impact on the projected sea-level rise.\n\nEstimation of the Antarctic surface mass balance using the regional climate model MAR (1979â2015) and identification of dominant processes\n\nCÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Anais Orsi, Vincent Favier, Hubert GallÃ©e, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Jan Melchior van Wessem, Willem Jan van de Berg, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 281–296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic surface mass balance (ASMB), a component of the sea level budget, is commonly estimated through modelling as observations are scarce. The polar-oriented regional climate model MAR performs well in simulating the observed ASMB. MAR and RACMO2 share common biases we relate to drifting snow transport, with a 3 times larger magnitude than in previous estimates. Sublimation of precipitation in the katabatic layer modelled by MAR is of a magnitude similar to an observation-based estimate.\n\nSensitivity of the current Antarctic surface mass balance to sea surface conditions using MAR\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Coraline Wyard, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3827–3839, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate models (RCMs) used to estimate the surface mass balance (SMB) of Antarctica depend on boundary forcing fields including sea surface conditions. Here, we assess the sensitivity of the Antarctic SMB to perturbations in sea surface conditions with the RCM MAR using unchanged atmospheric conditions. Significant SMB anomalies are found for SSC perturbations in the range of CMIP5 global climate model biases.\n\nSeasonal to decadal variability in ice discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nMichalea D. King, Ian M. Howat, Seongsu Jeong, Myoung J. Noh, Bert Wouters, Brice NoÃ«l, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3813–3825, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3813-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3813-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe derive the first continuous record of total ice discharged from all large Greenland outlet glaciers over the 2000–2016 period, resolving a distinct pattern of seasonal variability. We compare these results to glacier retreat and meltwater runoff and find that while runoff has a limited impact on ice discharge in summer, long-term changes in discharge are highly correlated to retreat. These results help to better understand Greenland outlet glacier sensitivity over a range of timescales.\n\nA new surface meltwater routing model for use on the Greenland Ice Sheet surface\n\nKang Yang, Laurence C. Smith, Leif Karlstrom, Matthew G. Cooper, Marco Tedesco, Dirk van As, Xiao Cheng, Zhuoqi Chen, and Manchun Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3791–3811, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3791-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3791-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA high-resolution spatially lumped hydrologic surface routing model is proposed to simulate meltwater transport over bare ice surfaces. In an ice-covered catchment, meltwater is routed by slow interfluve flow (~10−3–10−4 m s−1) followed by fast open-channel flow (~10−1 m s−1). Seasonal evolution of supraglacial stream-river networks substantially alters the magnitude and timing of moulin discharge with implications for subglacial hydrology and ice dynamics.\n\nExploration of Antarctic Ice Sheet 100-year contribution to sea level rise and associated model uncertainties using the ISSM framework\n\nNicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Helene Seroussi, Michael P. Schodlok, Eric Y. Larour, Carmen Boening, Daniel Limonadi, Michael M. Watkins, Mathieu Morlighem, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3511–3534, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3511-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3511-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing NASA supercomputers and a novel framework, in which Sandia National Laboratories' statistical software is embedded in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's ice sheet model, we run a range of 100-year warming scenarios for Antarctica. We find that 1.2 m of sea level contribution is achievable, but not likely. Also, we find that bedrock topography beneath the ice drives potential for regional sea level contribution, highlighting the need for accurate bedrock mapping of the ice sheet interior.\n\nBrief communication: Impact of the recent atmospheric circulation change in summer on the future surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nAlison Delhasse, Xavier Fettweis, Christoph Kittel, Charles Amory, and CÃ©cile Agosta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3409–3418, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3409-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3409-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSince the 2000s, an atmospheric circulation change (CC) gauged by a negative summer shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation has been observed, enhancing surface melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Future GrIS surface mass balance (SMB) projections are based on global climate models that do not represent this CC. The modelÂ MARÂ has been used to show that previous estimates of these projections could have been significantly overestimated if this current circulation pattern persists.\n\nBrief communication: Recent changes in summer Greenland blocking captured by none of the CMIP5 models\n\nEdward Hanna, Xavier Fettweis, and Richard J. Hall\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3287–3292, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3287-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3287-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe latest/recent generations of global climate models do not simulate the recent (last 30 years) increase in atmospheric high pressure over Greenland in summer but rather projects decreasing pressure. This difference between climate models and observations raises serious questions about the ability of the models to accurately represent future changes in Greenland climate and ice-sheet mass balance. There are also likely effects on climate predictions downstream, e.g. over Europe.\n\nSeasonal mass variations show timing and magnitude of meltwater storage in the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nJiangjun Ran, Miren Vizcaino, Pavel Ditmar, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Twila Moon, Christian R.

Here, we combine data from the satellite gravimetry, surface mass balance, and ice discharge to analyze the mass budget of Greenland at various temporal scales. This study, for the first time, suggests the existence of a substantial meltwater storage during summer, with a peak value of 80–120 Gt in July. We highlight its importance for understanding ice sheet mass variability\n\nSeasonal monitoring of melt and accumulation within the deep percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet and comparison with simulations of regional climate modeling\n\nAchim Heilig, Olaf Eisen, Michael MacFerrin, Marco Tedesco, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1851–1866, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1851-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1851-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents data on temporal changes in snow and firn, which were not available before. We present data on water infiltration in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet that improve our understanding of liquid water retention in snow and firn and mass transfer. We compare those findings with model simulations. It appears that simulated accumulation in terms of SWE is fairly accurate, while modeling of the individual parameters density and liquid water content is incorrect.\n\nBrief communication: Improved simulation of the present-day Greenland firn layer (1960â2016)\n\nStefan R. M. Ligtenberg, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Brice P. Y. NoÃ«l, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1643–1649, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1643-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1643-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn is the transitional product between fresh snow and glacier ice, and a 10-100 m thick layer covers the Greenland ice sheet. It has the capacity to store meltwater and thereby mitigate runoff to the ocean. Using a model and improved atmospheric forcing, we simulate firn density and temperature that agrees well with observations from firn cores. Especially in the regions with substantial melt, and therefore the most sensitive to a warming climate, the results improved significantly.\n\nModelling the climate and surface mass balance of polar ice sheets using RACMO2 â PartÂ 2: Antarctica (1979â2016)\n\nJan Melchior van Wessem, Willem Jan van de Berg, Brice P.

The model successfully reproduces the present-day climate and surface mass balance (SMB) when compared with an extensive set of observations and improves on previous estimates of the Antarctic climate and SMB. This study shows that the latest version of RACMO2 can be used for high-resolution future projections over the AIS.\n\nChanging pattern of ice flow and mass balance for glaciers discharging into the Larsen A and B embayments, Antarctic Peninsula, 2011 to 2016\n\nHelmut Rott, Wael Abdel Jaber, Jan Wuite, Stefan Scheiblauer, Dana Floricioiu, Jan Melchior van Wessem, Thomas Nagler, Nuno Miranda, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1273–1291, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1273-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1273-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed volume change, mass balance and ice flow of glaciers draining into the Larsen A and Larsen B embayments on the Antarctic Peninsula for 2011 to 2013 and 2013 to 2016. The mass balance is based on elevation change measured by the radar satellite mission TanDEM-X and on the mass budget method. The glaciers show continuing losses in ice mass, which is a response to ice shelf break-up. After 2013 the downwasting of glaciers slowed down, coinciding with years of persistent sea ice cover.\n\nExtreme temperature events on Greenland in observations and the MAR regional climate model\n\nAmber A. Leeson, Emma Eastoe, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1091–1102, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1091-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1091-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is predicted using regional climate models (RCMs). Here, we assess the ability of the MAR RCM to reproduce observed extreme temperature events and the melt energy produced during these times at 14 locations. We find that MAR underestimates temperatures by >0.5 °C during extreme events, which leads to an underestimate in melt energy by up to 41 %. This is potentially an artefact of the data used to drive the MAR simulation and needs to be corrected for.\n\nModelling the climate and surface mass balance of polar ice sheets using RACMO2 â PartÂ 1: Greenland (1958â2016)\n\nBrice NoÃ«l, Willem Jan van de Berg, J.

The model successfully reproduces the present-day climate and surface mass balance, i.e. snowfall minus meltwater run-off, of the GrIS compared to in situ observations. Since run-off from marginal narrow glaciers is poorly resolved at 11 km, further statistical downscaling to 1 km resolution is required for mass balance studies.\n\nIncreased West Antarctic and unchanged East Antarctic ice discharge over the last 7 years\n\nAlex S. Gardner, Geir Moholdt, Ted Scambos, Mark Fahnstock, Stefan Ligtenberg, Michiel van den Broeke, and Johan Nilsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 521–547, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe map present-day Antarctic surface velocities from Landsat imagery and compare to earlier estimates from radar. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 89â¯% of the observed increase in ice discharge. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic have been remarkably stable. Our work suggests that patterns of mass loss are part of a longer-term phase of enhanced flow.\n\nCenturies of intense surface melt on Larsen C Ice Shelf\n\nSuzanne L. Bevan, Adrian Luckman, Bryn Hubbard, Bernd Kulessa, David Ashmore, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Martin O'Leary, Adam Booth, Heidi Sevestre, and Daniel McGrath\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2743–2753, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2743-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2743-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFive 90 m boreholes drilled into an Antarctic Peninsula ice shelf show units of ice that are denser than expected and must have formed from refrozen surface melt which has been buried and transported downstream. We used surface flow speeds and snow accumulation rates to work out where and when these units formed. Results show that, as well as recent surface melt, a period of strong melt occurred during the 18th century. Surface melt is thought to be a factor in causing recent ice-shelf break-up.\n\nRegional Antarctic "
