        "text": "The Bernoulli Society organizes or sponsors several meetings in the area of Mathematical Statistics and Probability, whether, physical, virtual, or mixed.\n\nBernoulli sponsorship entails the following three stipulations:\n\nDisplaying the Bernoulli logo in all publicity material, including webpages, posters, flyers, etc.\n\nNaming a Bernoulli Society member who will serve on the programme committee, and who will ensure the meeting is publicized in Bernoulli News as a Bernoulli sponsored meeting, and write a brief post-meeting report for Bernoulli News.\n\nOffering a reduced registration fee for Bernoulli Society members, unless the meeting charges a flat fee to all participants.\n\nOrganizers of a meeting seeking sponsorship should email their request to the Bernoulli Secretariat at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . Requests should (1) provide a succinct context and scientific rationale, and (2) explicitly address the three points listed above.\n\nPlease note that advertising sponsored meetings in Bernoulli News and E-Briefs is subject to deadlines and space being available.\n\nCALL FOR EMS PROPOSALS\n\nBernoulli announces a call for proposals for the European Meeting of Statisticians (EMS) 2026, 2027 and 2029. The European Meetings of Statisticians are central events for statistics and probability in Europe and worldwide. The meetings should be the natural forum where all European statisticians and probabilists meet to exchange ideas and learn about the latest scientific developments. The EMS is typically held in June or July at a time of year that helps maximize attendance, although timing may vary depending on the local circumstances of the chosen venue. The venue should be a location accessible to a large proportion of Bernoulli membership and European researchers.\n\nAnyone interested in hosting either EMS 2026, EMS 2027 or EMS 2029 should contact This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. who can provide detailed information for guidance on what is required. Pre-proposals to host EMS 2026 are encouraged to be sent by June 15, 2024 and will receive prompt feedback. Proposals are expected to be finalized by July 31, 2024.\n\nUpcoming meetings\n\nBernoulli-IMS 11th World Congress in Probability and Statistics in Bochum, Germany, August 12-16, 2024. conference website.\n\n44th Conference on Stochastic Processes and their Applications, Wrocław, Poland, July 14-18, 2025. conference website.\n\nOngoing seminars\n\nOne World Probability Seminar. conference website.\n\nOne World Extremes Seminar. conference website.\n\nOne World YoungStatS Webinar. conference website.\n\nAsia-Pacific Seminars in Probability and Statistics. conference website.\n\nBernoulli regular meetings\n\nBernoulli-IMS World Congress in Probability and Statistics\n\n12th 2028 - will be announced during the upcoming Congress in Bochum\n\n11th 2024 in Bochum, Germany, August 12-16, 2024, conference website.\n\n10th 2021 in Seoul, South Korea, July 19-23 2021, conference website.
