        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis study focuses on the history of the Russian empire's long acquaintance with a project that proposed alternative organization of political and cultural geography of the Northern Europe. Scandinavianism, nurtured by organicist rhetoric of Romanticism together with historical and philological investigations that dealt with kinship status of the Scandinavian languages at the beginning of the 19th century, proposed a supranational vision that primarily implied different forms of consolidation - from the intensification of the cultural ties to bold political designs of Scandinavian union-federation - primarily between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.1 Scandinavianism as a project that challenged contemporary, legally recognized state borders was hardly unique for mid-19th century Europe. It emerged during tectonic shifts that took place across the European intellectual landscape around the 1840s, when similar tendencies surfaced in German Confederation and Italian states.2 The political and cultural context of the Northern Europe, however, provided Scandinavianism with its distinct features.\n\nIn the case of (pan-)Scandinavianism, prefix 'pan' appears only in translation. In the Nordic mass-media, it has always been referred to as Skandinavism(en)3 since the first mention in a Danish newspaper in 1843 while it sometimes obtained the prefix in the foreign press with often pejorative connotations.4 Although Scandinavianism could back up expansionist ambitions, rhetorically it was often presented as based on agreement, trust, freedom of\n\n1 During the period that this research concerns with, Sweden and Norway were united by a personal union and are usually referred to as Sweden-Norway. See: Raymond E. Lindgren, Norway-Sweden: Union, Disunion, and Scandinavian Integration (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015); Bo Strath, Union och demokrati: de forenade rikena Sverige-Norge 1814-1905 (Nora: Bokforlaget Nya Doxa, 2005).\n\n2 Although some scholars trace the continuity of early Romantic impulses in 1800s as shaping firm grounds for 1840s movements, I am more inclined to see the breach between the two cases, than the genealogy. However, the organicist vocabulary of brotherly peoples coined at the beginning of the century was revoked, though with altered connotations.\n\n3 'En' is a definite suffix.\n\n4 Ruth Hemstad, \"Scandinavianism: Mapping the Rise of a New Concept,\" Contributions to the History of Concepts 13, no. 1 (June 1, 2018): 1-21, https://doi.org/10.3167/choc.2018.130102; Alexander Maxwell, \"Pan-Nationalism as a Category in Theory and Practice,\" Nationalism and Ethnic Politics 28, no. 1 (2022): 1-19, https://doi.org/10.1080/13537113.2021.2004767.\n\ndecision-making and even altruism.5 By the mid-19th century, the project, although it was contested by local nationalist and conservative programmes, gained momentum on the pages of the press, in the offices of foreign ministries, at professional and scientific conferences, and among the representatives of the royal courts in Denmark and Sweden-Norway. Scandinavianism was capable of mobilizing thousands of its adherents in the streets of the Nordic capitals and, just as importantly, dozens in the highest cabinets. Ultimately, however, Scandinavianism failed in its aspirations of the political unity of the Scandinavian nations, and the defeat of Denmark in the Second War for Schleswig in 1864 is usually presented as its dramatic but logical result in the historiography, although these views are being challenged by modern research.6\n\nThe Russian empire - by virtue of being a neighbor to Sweden-Norway - worried about social and political capital of Scandinavianism, exacerbated by usually hostile rhetoric of its advocates. Moreover, since the Grand Duchy of Finland - a polity that in many regards retained Swedish culture, legal foundations, and institutions - remained under the scepter of the Russian Emperor since 1808-9, Scandinavianist echoes that resonated there produced internal concerns for the resilience of the imperial abode. Indeed, in Finland certain student groups and political associations regarded Scandinavian orientation as a compelling alternative to the power gravity of Saint-Petersburg. The reception of Scandinavianism in the Finlandish educated society, however, produced tensions given the synchronic rise of the Finnish-centered cultural project of Fennomania that in some of its editions repudiated Scandinavian-leaning tendencies. The dynamics of the relations between Scandinavianism and Fennomania, however, were much more complex, as I attempt to demonstrate in this dissertation.\n\n5 On expansionist ambitions see, for example: Einar Hedin, Sverige-Norge och Preussen: 1860 -1863; projekt till Danmarks delning (Stockholm: Vitterhets historie och antikvitets akademien, 1952).\n\n6 Morten Nordhagen Ottosen and Rasmus Glenthej, Union eller undergang (Kebenhavn: Gads forlag, 2021); Ruth Hemstad, Fra Indian Summer til nordisk vinter: skandinavisk samarbeid, skandinavisme og unions0pplosningen (Oslo: Akademisk Publisering, 2008); Tim van Gerven, Scandinavism: Overlapping and Competing Identities in the Nordic World, 1770-1919 (Leiden: Brill, 2022).\n\nThe imperial concerns about the dynamics of the project in Scandinavia and in Finland, however, were not static. First, Scandinavianism itself was a vibrant and flexible programme that survived through several decades by transforming its principles and rhetoric that resonated with contemporary anxieties and hopes on regional and local levels. Second, the imperial cabinets and publics perceived Scandinavianism differently. Their perceptions were conditioned by particularity of communication channels, foreign politics combinations, internal tensions, imperial languages of rationalization, visions of ethnic or class-based groupness and management style of these groups.7 Scandinavianism was a kaleidoscope of meanings, threats, and anxieties determined, besides the mobility and flexibility of the project itself, by how variegated imperial agents - in Scandinavian capitals, ministerial cabinets, Saint-Petersburg palaces, streets of Ábo (Turku) and Helsingfors (Helsinki) - understood the empire, its present politics, demands, and expectations. The relevance of my work lies in revisiting many of the well-established historiographical notions of how imperial agents at various levels perceived the threat of pan-Scandinavism.\n\nWhereas there were synchronic contestations and debates about the nature of Scandinavianism in the press and among the government officials, I am mostly interested in how this perception changed on the diachronic timescale from the 1840s to the 1860s. The turbulent period from Nicholas I's conservative rule to Alexander II's unprecedented reforms witnessed European wars and revolutions, triumphs and defeats of the imperial power, repressions and emancipations of various scale, but most essentially, profound transformations of the social and political architecture of the regime that echoed in all composite parts of the empire. These changes resulted from comprehension of pan-imperial issues and were stipulated by imperial reactions on local manifestations, demands, and projects from the composite parts,\n\n7 Ilya Gerasimov et al., \"New Imperial History and the challenges of empire,\" in Empire Speaks Out: Languages of Rationalization and Self-Description in the Russian Empire, ed. Ilya Gerasimov, Jan Kusber and Alexander Semyonov (Leiden: Brill, 2010), 1-32, https://doi.org/10.1163/ej.9789004175716.i-280.4.\n\nincluding Finland. The relevance of my research is determined by addressing and reassessing essential topics of modern historiography related to Russian empire and Grand Duchy of Finland, imperial rule and its repertoire of power utilized within and beyond its borders, political languages, official institutional hierarchies, informal patron-client relations, practices of loyalty and opposition, and channels of information processing - all of which directly influenced imperial perceptions of and reactions on the issues related to pan-Scandinavian project.\n\nNovelty of the research\n\nThis dissertation attempts to bring together three distinct historiographical fields that are not usually treated together, namely the history of the Russian diplomacy, the history of diversity management within the imperial abode, and the history of Finland as a special composite part of the empire. I am trying to complete this endeavor through the analysis of imperial reactions to the phenomenon of Scandinavianism. Although each of these fields have enjoyed considerable attention of scholars, I argue that only a synthetic analytical work that combines these subjects and disciplinary subfields allows for complex questions to be posed and answered. The sophisticated picture of imperial and Finlandish responses to Scandinavianism, of their designs and implementations has never been provided before.\n\nThis study clarifies the workings of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian empire in presenting the threat of Scandinavianism to the emperor and acting upon it through various measures. The thesis first places the activity of the ministry in the context of the post-Napoleonic system of international relations, which established a repertoire of actions available for the Great Powers in relation to potential threats, as well as formulated a universal language for describing these threats. My research sheds light on the diplomats' attempts to translate regional Scandinavianist aspirations - usually regarded as perennial and geopolitical in the\n\nrelevant historiography8 - into this pan-European language of collective security to develop a follow-up response.\n\nBesides, the dissertation argues that Finland was a particular object of diplomatic concerns with regards to Scandinavianism both as an externally 'contested' territory and as an area threatened by potential domestic agitation. The Finlandish administration and especially governors-general played a particular role in diplomatic communication related to the issue.9 Finally, the dissertation addresses post-Crimean diplomatic perceptions of Scandinavianism, pointing to the limitations of the aristocratic-diplomatic surveillance over the project and omnipresent narrative of Scandinavianist downfall in their dispatches. The thesis reassesses the expectations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the idea of Scandinavian union during the crucial years of 1863-4, revealing adaptive rather than exclusively repressive response that was conditioned by the imperial exposure to new principles that manifested themselves in the diplomatic world.\n\nSecond, this dissertation traces previously unexplored genealogy of internal administrative reactions to the danger of Scandinavianism in the Grand Duchy of Finland that usually finds itself in the peripheral position in standard narratives about this pan-national project. The research attempts to demonstrate earlier understudied relations between the languages of rationalization of multilayered imperial diversity and instrumentalized practices elaborated to counter Scandinavianism. Ascribed revolutionary potential of Scandinavianism in the 1840s rather approximated it with other cosmopolitical threats coming from abroad, and Fennomania often stood close to the idea of the Scandinavian consolidation than seen as opposed to it in the administrative optics. Moreover, public reactions to Scandinavianism in\n\n8 Emanuel Halicz, Russia and Denmark 1856-1864: A Chapter of Russian Policy towards the Scandinavian Countries (Copenhagen: Reitzel, 1990), 549-53.\n\n9 For a similar argument on the role of the Finlandish administration, see also: Lidija Lempijajnen, \"Vneshnie kontakty Velikogo Knjazhestva Finljandskogo: 1809-1914 gg.\" (PhD diss., Herzen State Pedagogical University, 2007); Lolo Krusius-Ahrenberg, \"Finland och den svensk-ryska allianspolitiken intill 1830/31 ârs polska revolution,\" Historiska och litteraturhistoriska studier, no. 21-22 (1946): 153-346.\n\nFinland reinforced this vision, and some intellectuals could regard the two projects as complimentary.\n\nModern political-ethnographic mapping that was formulated as a result of the Crimean War and Polish Uprising as well as the development of academic inquiry into national characters and mores redefined Scandinavianism and resulted in its growing association with ostensible conspiracies of Swedish-speaking population in Finland. However, the definition was contested and in the situation of persisting censorship regulations, the struggle for this definition rather deployed in the administrative cabinets that articulated Scandinavian dangers - or their absence - to pursue their own goals. Scandinavianism appeared to be an inquisitorial label that the administration and especially governor-general used in their communication with Saint-Petersburg, attuned to the changing political language of the reforming and modernizing empire.\n\nThird, this study introduces new agents into the history of the imperial perception of Scandinavism. In addition to public intellectuals in Finland and Russian proper, whose opinions were not previously brought to light in the analysis of this problem, the dissertation addresses previously obscured institutions of surveillance and control - primarily that of the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery10 - that profoundly affected the treatment of Scandinavianism in Saint-Petersburg. The Third Section headquarters in Finland constituted alternative center of knowledge-production, monitoring, and feedback provision that partook in the formulation of Scandinavianist danger, its ethnographic profile as well as in the cabinet wars as a quasi-independent 'third party'.\n\n10 But see relevant studies on the Third Section in Finland without, however, particular focus on Scandinavianism: Osmo Jussila, \"Keisarikunnan moraalilaakarit: poliittinen santarmivalvonta Suomessa 1800-luvulla,\" in Ajankohta: poliittisen historian vuosikirja 1994 ed. Mikko Majander (Helsinki, 1993), 8-36; Marina Zagora, \"Gendarme control in the Grand Duchy of Finland in the 19th century,\" Vestnik YarGU, no. 3 (2020): 40-43; Marina Zagora, \"Portraying the Local Life? Gendarme Control in the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Gendarme Reports from the 'Periphery,' 1866-1881,\" Journal of Finnish Studies 25, no. 2 (December 1, 2022): 226-52, https://doi.org/10.5406/28315081.25.2.04.\n\nFinally, the source base for this study includes materials from eleven archival repositories located in the Russian Federation, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. Drawing on previously unexplored sources, this work sheds light on structural elements and details of the functioning of imperial institutions, transnational communication networks, and personal relations of various agents to the dynamics of the pan-Scandinavian movement.\n\nPurpose of the study and research question\n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to analyze the dynamics of multidimensional governmental, public, and private reactions to the phenomenon of Scandinavianism, its real and imagined effects in the Russian empire and Finland in 1843-1864. My research question is: 'How and under what circumstances were imperial perceptions of Scandinavianism changing during the period?'\n\nResearch objectives\n\n• Identify structural conditions, backgrounds, and factors of governmental acquittance with Scandinavianism in Finland and Russia\n\n• Determine genealogy, context, and details of the diplomatic response to Scandinavianism in Copenhagen and Stockholm as well as in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Saint-Petersburg\n\n• Trace the reactions of the imperial multilingual public spheres to the dynamics of pan-Scandinavian project\n\n• Analyze the range of institutional views on the challenges posed by pan-Scandinavian idea, as well as repertoire of measures designed and implemented to impede the intensification of this idea in the international and domestic political fields\n\nThe object of my study is the set of source materials related to the imperial diplomatic and government institutions, agents, and public spheres that in one way or another reflected and reacted on different aspects of Scandinavianism, whether real or imagined. The subject of this dissertation is the range of views, opinions, perceptions that crystallized in imperial cabinets and public spheres as a result of their acquaintance with pan-Scandinavian project, the context in which they were formulated, and measures that were created through the operationalization of these diverse insights.\n\nResearch methodology\n\nThis study mostly fathoms into the debates and decisions that took place in cabinets and palaces. Often, these 'debates' surface as my speculative constructions since the interlocutors might have never faced each other but 'communicated' by the means of their reports, dispatches, and letters sent to Saint-Petersburg. The dissertation does consider broader agency and other environments, of course, but it mostly concerns itself with these settings. On the one hand, this dissertation thus analyses institutions in a manner rather traditional for Russian imperial and Finnish national historiography.11 Moreover, since these negotiations often concerned policies that were meant to be applied to particular groups defined on the basis of their confession, class, or ethnic status, the dissertation draws on studies of the imperial policies with regards to particular communities and territories.12\n\nOn the other hand, and I would argue most essentially, the dissertation addresses conceptual languages of these debates and decisions, their rhetoric, metaphors, allusions,\n\n11 See classic studies, for example: Anatolij Remnev, Samoderzhavnoe pravitel'stvo: Komitet ministrov v sisteme vysshego upravlenija Rossijskoj imperii, vtoraja polovina XIX--nachalo XX veka (Moscow: ROSSPEN, 2010); Kristiina Kalleinen, \"The Nature of Russian Imperialism in Finland During the First Half of the Nineteenth Century,\" in Ethnic and National Issues in Russian and East European History, ed. John Morrison (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), 86-102.\n\n12 In this regard, see, for example: Paul W. Werth, The Tsar's Foreign Faiths: Toleration and the Fate of Religious Freedom in Imperial Russia (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014); Aleksei I. Miller, The Romanov Empire and Nationalism: Essays in the Methodology of Historical Research (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2008).\n\nreferences, comparisons, and other tropes that affected their appeal and their result. In this sense, the empire crystallized itself not in concrete buildings of Saint-Petersburg and Helsingfors or bureaucratic institutions but precisely in the tensions, misunderstandings, and errors that the interlocutors made in trying to grasp the complexity of what empire was and what it was meant to become. The empire, or rather imperial situation, manifests itself as the context of their negotiations and actions.13\n\nThis methodological intervention guides my analysis of multifaceted, often asymmetric communications that spanned around the issue - or even diverse issues - that related to Scandinavianism. In addressing these misunderstandings and attempts to overcome them, I introduce the term translation, meaning the attempts of imperial agents to introduce associations, equations, and common denominators - often altering the nature of the subject -between local or even foreign practices, legal procedures, and political categories with those imperial 'standards' understandable for the interlocutor. Theoretically, translation underscored synchronization but in reality it often resulted in uncalculated consequences.14\n\nExamining the period from 1843 to 1864, I can hardly ignore the rise of nationalism as one of the main challenges for imperial establishments across the globe.15 Challenges did not mean the inevitable imperial demise but rather required the adaptability of imperial regimes to new languages and practices of solidarity, and many European empires appeared surprisingly successful in this, being able to capitalize on respective nationalisms in the role of their guardians.16 The research on nationalisms encompasses thousands of volumes of theoretical\n\n13 Gerasimov et al., \"New Imperial History and the challenges of empire\"; Alexander Semyonov, \"Empire as a Context Setting Category,\" Ab Imperio, no. 1 (2008): 193-204, https://doi.org/10.1353/imp.2008.0140.\n\n14 I am particularly inspired by: Vicente L. Rafael, Motherless Tongues: The Insurgency of Language amid Wars of Translation (Durham: Duke University Press, 2016).\n\n15 It might be, however, that the role of nationalism as a challenge for empires was overdriven or misunderstood. See: Pieter M. Judson, The Habsburg Empire: A New History (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 2016).\n\n16 Stefan Berger and Alexei Miller, eds., Nationalizing Empires (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2015); Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper, Empires in World History: Power and the Politics of Difference (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011); Krishan Kumar, \"The Idea of Empire,\" in Visions of Empire: How Five Empires Shaped the World (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017), 1-36, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvc773dq.5.\n\nliterature enriched by detailed case-studies. Some of those have found their place in the core alphabet of the humanities, like Benedict Anderson's reflections on imagined communities or Ernest Gellner's principle of equation between national and political body.17 Methodologically, I am mostly indebted to Rogers Brubaker's elaborations on identity as a process rather than a crystallized entity. Brubaker highlights that groups - be they ethnicities or nations - are never givens but rather fields of struggle between different powers that competitively seek to categorize and classify the population while individuals or collectives, in their turn, might self-identify against the grain of such imposed procedures. Brubaker suggests moving from seeing groups to analyzing practices of groupness, and I completely share this principle.18\n\nIn studying diplomatic sources, I draw on the heterogenous theoretical intuitions of the new diplomatic history. Without much doubt, best examples of the classic diplomatic history around the issue of Scandinavianism transgressed the boundaries of the traditional disciplinary field and addressed questions beyond standard limits of the inquiry.19 New diplomatic history also calls for expanding boundaries of traditional diplomatic scholarship by focusing on issues of diplomatic culture and ritual, conceptual language of letters and dispatches, varieties of socialization and leisure, asymmetric negotiation and mediation.20 In building my research on subject works and these methodological interventions, I explore\n\n17 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (New York: Verso, 1991); Ernest Gellner, Nations and Nationalism (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008).\n\n18 Rogers Brubaker and Frederick Cooper, \"Beyond 'Identity',\" Theory and Society 29, no. 1 (February 1, 2000): 1-47, https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007068714468; Rogers Brubaker, \"Ethnicity without Groups,\" European Journal of Sociology /Archives Européennes de Sociologie /Europäisches Archiv Für Soziologie 43, no. 2 (2002): 163-89.\n\n19 Here are some of them: Henrik Becker-Christensen, Skandinaviske dromme ogpolitiske realiteter: Den politiske skandinavisme i Danmark 1830-1850 (Ârhus: Arusia, 1981); Halicz, Russia and Denmark 1856-1864; Erik Moller, Skandinavisk strœben og svenskpolitik omkring 1860 (Kobenhavn: G. E. C. Gad, 1948).\n\n20 Jennifer Mori, \"The State of the Art. The Way of the Future,\" Diplomatica 1, no. 1 (April 10, 2019): 5-12, https://doi.org/10.1163/25891774-00101002; Michael J.

Moreover, it also made implicit and explicit references to experiences of others within the borders of the region legitimate and justified by allusions to similarity of culture, origin, language, civilization, and other categories that rhetorically made them closer. On the one hand, this framework predated Scandinavianism and indeed laid foundations for its rise. On the other hand, Scandinavianism also dialectically solidified its mental reproduction.22\n\nState of the art\n\nScandinavianism as a political project\n\nAs early as 1900, Danish historian Julius Clausen made an observation that remains highly relevant even for contemporary research, namely that Scandinavianism is a term hard to define precisely.23 Indeed, up to this day Scandinavianism is competitively fashioned as a movement, vision, political trajectory, and diplomatic problem in the historiography. My dissertation focuses mostly on political and diplomatic workings around Scandinavianism, and I propose to start this section with analysis of political repercussions of the project.\n\n21 In this, I am intellectually indebted to: Harald Gustafsson, \"A State That Failed?,\" Scandinavian Journal of History 31, no. 3-4 (September 1, 2006): 205-20, https://doi.org/10.1080/03468750600930720; Torkel Jansson, \"Between Two Worlds : Nordic Political Cultures in a Comparative Perspective,\" in Scripts of Kingship: Essays on Bernadotte and Dynastic Formation in an Age of Revolution, ed.

He limits himself mostly to Danish sources and shows how Scandinavism emerged from political aspirations of the Danish national-liberals. Clausen discovers the roots of the project in cultural ties and romantic explorations of the late 18th century. Whereas cultural and intellectual connections are appreciated by the author, political reverberations are dismissed - in a rather teleological fashion - as nothing but a fantasy of the youngsters who misinterpreted European and regional context.24 This reflection on the gene of failure in the DNA of political Scandinavianism affected a great deal of the later research.\n\nThis work was later followed by deeper investigations of the national and local lives of Scandinavianism. John Sannes explored the Norwegian reception of the project and particular groups who sought to legitimize it in the public sphere.25 Examining the press and private correspondence, Sannes argues that Scandinavian idea was not particularly popular in Norwegian intellectual circles since its main objectives that included the introduction of constitution or more inclusive representation, continued existence of Denmark and Swedish revanchist plans, usually did not relate to the local interests. Although this approach is gradually being reassessed and nuanced,26 my research contributes little to the Norwegian edition of the project.\n\nThe Danish historian Henrik Becker-Christensen is skeptical of the movement's political ambitions as well.27 According to his argument, Denmark was in dire need of military and diplomatic support against Prussia and the German states. This necessity coupled with liberal rhetoric of the opposition turned Scandinavianism into a viable survival strategy.\n\n24 Julius Clausen, Skandinavismen.\n\n25 John Sanness, Patrioter, intelligens og skandinaver: Norske reaksjoner pa skandinavismen for 1848 (Oslo: Universitetsforlag, 1959).\n\n26 0ystein Serensen, Norsk idéhistorie: Kampen om Norges sjel, vol. 3 (Oslo: Aschehoug, 2001); Niri Ragnvald Johnsen, '\"Vi hafva ifran morgon till qvall varit ute och agiterat\": Skandinavismen og pressen 1848-1864' (MA diss., University of Oslo, 2018).\n\n27 Henrik Becker-Christensen, Skandinaviske dromme og politiske realiteter: Den politiske skandinavisme i Danmark 1830-1850 (Árhus: Arusia, 1981).\n\nBecker-Christensen makes extensive use of police reports and government communications to ascertain the Danish authorities' assessment of the dangers posed by the movement prior to the regime change of 1848. The historian, moreover, sheds light on the Russian diplomats' anxieties about the progress of the movement and argues that their pressure put a stop on many Scandinavianist impulses and organizing visions. Becker-Christensen's analysis of imperial perception of the project reveals many distinct intuitions of the diplomatic agents, although his exclusive focus on Denmark does not allow him to make broader conclusions.\n\nOther essential works put more weight on the aspects of political imagination and struggle in Denmark that affected visions of pan-Scandinavian futures there. Rasmus Glenth0j, Uffe Ostegaard, Hans Vammen, Michael Bregnsbo and Kurt Villard Jensen - each in their own way - attempt to contextualize national-liberal aspirations and Scandinavianist imaginaries against the backdrop of a complex imperial situation in the Oldenburg empire.28 Their works examine various aspects of nationalist and infrastructural challenges to imperial domains as well as strategies of suppression and accommodation exhibited by the Danish rule with regards to these obstacles. They address the rise of new political agents, languages, and visions of the future that competed for claiming their dominance in the political field. Their texts draw on modern theoretical and methodological foundations, but they also elaborate upon a solid tradition of the Danish political history of the 19th century, whose foundations were shaped by the works of Alexander Thors0e, Niels Neergaard, Erik M0ller and others.29\n\n28 Rasmus Glenthej, 1864 - Sonner af de Slagne (Kebenhavn: Gads forlag, 2014); Uffe 0stergaard, \"NationalBuilding and Nationalism in the Oldenburg Empire,\" in Nationalizing Empires ed. by Stefan Berger and Alexei Miller (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2015), 461-509; Hans Vammen, Den tomme stat: Angst og ansvar i danskpolitik 1848-1864 (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2011); Michael Bregnsbo and Kurt Villads Jensen, The Rise and Fall of the Danish Empire (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2022).\n\n29 Alexander Thorsee, Kong Frederik den Syvendes regering, et bidrag til den danske stats historie fra 1848-1863 (Kebenhavn: Gyldendalske boghandels forlag, 1884); Niels Neergaard, Under Junigrundloven, vol. 1 (Kebenhavn: P.G.

Ole Fsldbek and Inge Adriansen draw attention to the formulation of new national symbols and imaginaries that often were opposed or mutually exclusive with the semantic repertoire of Oldenburg empire.30 Aladin Largueche elaborates on the issues of the semantic border-mapping that assisted in formulating oppositions between Danish and German as well as between Scandinavian and Russian.31 Steed Bo Frandsen, however, demonstrates the broad range of self-identifications adhered to by the subjects of the Danish king, arguing that 'German' and 'Danish' positions were hegemonically projected by the nationalist rhetoric while the palette of statuses remained much more heterogenous even during the crisis years of wars and revolutions.32\n\nAlthough since the 2000s, there appeared a relative decline of interest for the political history of pan-Scandinavian project, giving way to research on its cultural visions, communication networks, and non-governmental agencies, Morten Nordhagen Ottosen and Rasmus Glenthoj have forcefully manifested the revival of investigations into the political dynamics of Scandinavianism in their huge volume Union eller undergang. Arguing against teleological narratives about the downfall of the Scandinavian union idea, the two historians reassess its chances, revealing the complex dynamics of negotiations, quarrels, and decision-making on both sides of the 0resund to argue that Scandinavian union served as a final goal of many other subordinate political programmes in Denmark and Sweden-Norway.

Without doubt, a new standard work that presents a fresh narrative of pan-Scandinavian project, the book is encyclopedic - not to say megalomaniac - in its ambitions. One of the main networks of communication that endowed Scandinavianism with real political capital, according to their argument, was\n\ndiplomacy.33\n\nDiplomacy and Scandinavianism\n\nThe historiographic tradition of diplomatic history has expanded the range of instrumentalized approaches that have been used to analyze pan-Scandinavian project. As early as 1912, Hjalmar Haralds published a history of Swedish diplomatic and military support for Denmark in 1848 then elaborated and continued by Erik Lofgren and Bo Lundqvist.34 Since Sweden and the Russian empire declared their collective demarche, Russian position was also briefly addressed in the texts. Although Haralds pointed to the fact that the Swedish assistance was not determined exclusively by the public impulse of Scandinavism, the political capital of the movement in 1848 was hard to ignore at the diplomatic level. Haralds, Lofgren and Lundqvist drawing on a large body of archival sources that pertained to the diplomatic discussions, have only briefly touched on another important aspect of Oscar I's politics, namely his engagement with leading Swedish journals to shape the public opinion that would favor and reinforce his Denmark-focused activities. This aspect would play a crucial role during another crisis, the Crimean War.\n\n33 Ottosen and Glenthej, Union eller undergang.\n\n34 Hjalmar Haralds, Sveriges utrikespolitik 1848, ett bidrag till belysning af danska frägans första skede.

Sven Eriksson's research focuses on the change in Swedish foreign policy during 1853-6, when Oscar I was shifting from Swedish-Danish neutrality towards a military alliance with the maritime powers. This policy shift was accompanied by a propaganda campaign launched under the king's aegis in the domestic journals and even European public sphere. Oscar I, having signed the November Treaty of 1855, was ready to join the coalition of European powers, but peace negotiations that soon started confused his plans.35 Mart Kuldkepp, capitalizing on the research of the Swedish position during the Crimean War, has recently revisited persistent narratives of Swedish neutrality, arguing that Sweden was in fact one step from entering the hostilities under the banners of Finnish-centered revanchism and Scandinavian union.36\n\nAke Holmberg extends Ericsson's focus to examine the extent to which Scandinavian ideas were popular among the Swedish elite and the significance of the pan-Scandinavian agenda in Swedish foreign policy. Drawing on a wide range of diplomatic and bureaucratic sources as well as on the materials of the press, he argues that Scandinavianism became one of the main ideas around which political debates unfolded in the cabinets and courts of the Scandinavian monarchs.37 Erik Moller, another researcher of Scandinavianism in the high cabinets has also stressed that the promotion of Scandinavian union was only possible in the context of a doppelganger diplomacy: monarchical figures and especially King Charles XV\n\n35 Sven Eriksson, Svensk diplomati och tidningspress under Krimkriget (Stockholm: P.A.

He pioneered the introduction of a new variable into the Scandinavianist equation, namely the diplomacy of the Russian empire and its influence on foreign policies of the Nordic kingdoms. Previous works, including that of M0ller and Becker-Christensen have engaged with Russian materials but Halicz's exhaustive research in the Russian archives, his impeccable knowledge of diplomatic personnel and its workings set this work on another level in its Russia-focused aspects. The historian addresses particularly the period 1853-1864 in two books. First of them explores the dynamics of the Scandinavian and, in particular, Danish neutrality arguing that non-intervention was not a simple status but rather a dynamic system of checks and balances, compromise-seeking, maneuvering, and negotiation with multiple agents involved.39 Another book investigates Russian position vis-à-vis Denmark in 1856-1864 with particular emphasis on the tensions that erupted between Denmark and the German states over the issues of Schleswig. Halicz argues that Scandinavian fears continuously affected the trajectory of the imperial politics and reinforced its position as a guardian of the Danish integrity, although its intervention remained limited due to the necessity of implementing domestic reforms.40 Drawing on Halicz's analysis, my dissertation expands the aspects of the Russian imperial engagements with Scandinavianism, contributing to and in some respects revising Halicz's analysis.\n\nWhile this body of work illuminated the dynamics of international politics, the picture of diplomacy they painted often seems disconnected from other transnational information networks and intellectual debates. These studies portray foreign policy as a calculated world of\n\n38 M0ller, Skandinavisk strœben og svenskpolitik omkring 1860.\n\n39 Emanuel Halicz, Danish Neutrality During the Crimean War (1853-1856): Denmark Between the Hammer and the Anvil (Odense: Odense University Press, 1977).\n\n40 Halicz, Russia and Denmark 1856-1864.\n\nministerial discussion, independent of domestic political and cultural reflections while real agency is relegated solely to the cabinets and high emissaries. Going against the grain of this perspective, Ruth Hemstad addresses grassroot diplomacy and professional corporations that began to shape in Scandinavia after the idea of political integration was abandoned in the late 1860s. Shifting the focus from the political field to entrepreneurial cooperation enables her to formulate a new periodization of Scandinavianism, stretching it into the early 20th century. She convincingly demonstrates how the idea of Scandinavian rapprochement adapted to the new conditions of the globalizing world, association, and cooperation pushed forward by nongovernmental organizations.41\n\nOther investigations conceptualize students as essential low-level diplomatic agents behind the dynamics of Scandinavianism. Scandinavian student festivals, a tradition invented in the 1840s, surfaces as the main arena where new programmes and designs of the Scandinavian future crystallized, spread, and were negotiated while emotive bonds tied these students in networks of trust, friendship, and altruism. Moreover, as Henrik Ullstad demonstrates, students conventions gravitated city-dwellers and commoners into their performative spectacles, contributing to the enwidening of the boundaries of participation in Scandinavianist affairs.42 Fredrik Nilsson argues that Scandinavian students capitalized on the features of modernity in their appearances and in their imagination, where their vehicles -steamships cruising through the Baltic shores - became significant entities of the semantic system. While the scenes of students conventions became more and more politicized, internal tensions and disagreements were alleviated by emotional aspects of the conventions.43\n\n41 Hemstad, Fra Indian Summer til nordisk vinter.\n\n42 Henrik Ullstad, \"'Med mjöd och manligt glam pä fädrens sätt': studentskandinavismen som ideologi och performativ praktik,\" in Skandinavism: en rörelse och en ide under 1800-talet, ed.

This cluster of works lays bare the agency of transnational horizontal cooperation as opposed to hierarchical relations. The map of the Nordic universities as well as the circuit of academic and professional societies produced alternative matrix of integration. The geography of the universities, spanning from Copenhagen to Christiania, Lund, Uppsala and to a degree even Helsingfors shaped the knots of this web. These networks of cooperation could either behave independently of power hierarchies or occasionally surface as tools that could reinforce governmental projects, as happened during the students convention in 1856 extensively and coordinatingly covered across the regions producing transnational media event.45\n\nLanguage, culture, and communication\n\nIndeed, cross-border communication, translation, organization of media programmes that contributed to the creation of Scandinavian-wide historical and literary narratives previously eluded the focus of historical investigations and relatively recently manifested themselves in the study of Scandinavian identities-in-the-making. Kari Haarder Ekman frames pan-Scandinavism as a politically modest but culturally appealing identity programme. Ekman investigates literary connections and cultural projects within the Scandinavian context, conceptualizing the multitude of these relations as a 'republic of letters'. As it is rather the state of connectedness that manifests Scandinavianism in her reading, political perturbations of 1864\n\n44 Johnsen, '\"Vi hafVa ifrän morgon till qväll varit ute och agiterat\": Skandinavismen og pressen 1848-1864.'\n\n45 Jonas Harvard and Magdalena Hillström, \"Media Scandinavianism: Media Events and the Historical Legacy of Pan-Scandinavianism,\" in Communicating the North: Media Structures and Images in the Making of the Nordic Region ed. Jonas Harvard and Peter Stadius (Burlington: Ashgate, 2013), 75-98.\n\ndo not represent the stalemate but rather a point of its reconfiguration. Ekman regards pan-Scandinavism as an umbrella-project that implied competing visions of integration.46\n\nRuth Hemstad addressed the issue of self-naming and terms that the advocates and critics of Scandinavianism used, concluding that concepts like Scandinavia and Norden changed their contents throughout the 19th century, and pan-Scandinavian project greatly contributed to the reformulation and wide-spread use of the terms.47 This reformulation and attempts to accentuate a macronational identity, however, were often opposed by local identity-building processes that rejected region-wide allure of the project.48 However, Scandinavianism often demonstrated potential for adaptability to local conditions, and trans-border communication networks that fostered its development mostly by the means of public press serve as a testament to that, as Jonas Harvard, Peter Stadius, and Magdalena Hillström demonstrate.49\n\nOftentimes, the echo of Scandinavianist events reached as far as to Finland where students festivals, diplomatic twists, and political tensions in the North were enthusiastically followed by liberal public and apprehensively looked at by the administration. Pieter Dhondt in his study explores Nordic university anniversaries of the 19th century, and the Alexander Imperial University in Helsingfors also falls in his scope.50 In the chapter dedicated to the University of Helsingfors bicentenary in 1840, Dhondt investigates orchestrated imperial attempts to formulate Finnish national tradition that would, however, manifest itself as loyal to\n\n46 Kari Haarder Ekman, \"Mitt hems gränser vidgades\": en studie i den kulturella skandinavismen under 1800-talet (Göteborg: Makadam förlag, 2010).\n\n47 Ruth Hemstad, \"Scandinavian Sympathies and Nordic Unity: The Rhetoric of Scandinavianness in the Nineteenth Century,\" in Contesting Nordicness ed.

Dhondt's analysis, however, does not go far enough in analyzing the threats and anxieties that the Russian rule in Finland faced during the 1830s and 1840s, and my dissertation seeks to address this context in more detail.\n\nRussian empire and management of diversity\n\nThe Russian empire governed diverse populations across its domains. The imperial rule demonstrated different faces in its borderlands and composite parts, that ranged from colonial exploitation to granting autonomous legal regimes. Such distribution of rule depended on many factors that included classificatory regimes, national and racial taxonomies, imperial position in the European system of international affairs, historical precedents, and monarchical will among other variables of the equation. Finland was granted with legal autonomy that became an exception, especially after the suppressions of the Polish Uprisings in 1830-1 and 1863 which justified administrative intervention of the Russian rule into earlier autonomous system while the special position of the Baltic provinces was gradually corroding during the 19th century.51\n\nIt is unnecessary to provide a historiographical overview of the imperial designs and transformations across all the domains. However, it is important to understand that Finland was often viewed by Saint-Petersburg and local administration as a part of the larger realm, and patterns of thinking, anxieties, epistemological regimes elaborated with regards to one territory and population often expanded to other areas of the imperial rule either to find contrasts or to discover parallels there. Recognizing this habit of the imperial rule, I draw on wide array of studies devoted to Russian rule in different territorial contexts. Andreas Kappeler's pioneering\n\n51 Alexander Morrison, The Russian Conquest of Central Asia: A Study in Imperial Expansion, 1814-1914 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2020); Darius Staliünas, Making Russians: Meaning and Practice of Russification in Lithuania and Belarus After 1863 (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2007); Edward C. Thaden, ed., Russification in the Baltic Provinces and Finland, 1855-1914 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981).\n\nstudy of Russia as a 'multinational realm' gave impetus to broader and deeper reflections on the consequences of this multinationalism for the government apparatus.52 With regards to the administrative borderland practices, I particularly draw on the analysis and conclusions made by Edward Thaden, Theodore Weeks, Alexei Miller, Mikhail Dolbilov, Anatoliy Remnev, Jane Burbank, and many others.53\n\nAnother conceptualization of the empire is proposed by a group of scholars behind the journal Ab Imperio. Their contributions, drawing on new analytical vocabulary of imperial situation, languages of rationalization and self-description, focus on the visions that those in power forge to manage the diversity. Distancing empire from the rigidness of a state that is usually supplied with territory and homogenous nation, their works provide optics able to address hybrid strategies of coexistence and management within the imperial abode. Flexible with regards to narration modes and theoretical frameworks, their umbrella-conceptualization seeks to avoid grand narratives and center-periphery dichotomies, providing a space for new interpretations. Focusing on the tensions between competing projects of self-organization and imperial aspirations to management of diversity, Marina Mogilner, Ilya Gerasimov, Sergey Glebov, and Alexander Semyonov highlight ambiguities of the imperial means as well as unpredictability of its ends.54\n\n52 Andreas Kappeler, Russland als Vielvolkerreich: Entstehung, Geschichte, Zerfall (Munich: C.H.

Politically and culturally, Finlandish identity also fluctuated between the two poles: Stockholm, with which Finland for a long period of time preserved institutional and commercial bond,56 and Saint-Petersburg, a new center of power and an alluring place for migration and career pursuits as studied by Max Engman.57\n\nThe history of Finland in the imperial context was extensively addressed in by Matti Klinge, Osmo Jussila, Robert Schweitzer, Juhani Paasivirta, and Lev Suni who formulated the picture of asymmetrical but ultimately peaceful negotiations - cultural, legal, and political -that characterized most of the Finlandish-Russian political relations up to the 1880s when the imperial reactionary programmes interfered in the borderland policies.58 Other works focus on the issues of administrative institutions in Finland, their range of responsibilities, power-relations between them, and their role in securing or thwarting the privileged position of\n\n55 Carl Gabriel von Bonsdorff, Opinioner och stämningar i Finland, 1808-1814 (Helsingfors: Söderström, 1918); Päiviö Tommila, La Finlande dans la politique européenne en 1809-1815 (Helsinki: Suomen Historiallinen Seura, 1962); Päiviö Tommila, Suomen autonomian synty, 1808-1819 (Helsinki: Valtioneuvoston kanslia, 1984); Vadim Vadimovich Roginskij, Bor'ba za Skandinaviju: mezhdunarodnye otnoshenija na Severe Evropy v jepohu Napoleonovskih vojn 1805-1815 (Moscow: Ves' Mir, 2012).\n\n56 Arvi Lajdinen, Razvitie kapitalizma vpromyshlennosti Finljandii: pervaja polovina XIXv (Leningrad: Nauka, 1979); Torkel Jansson, Rikssprängningen som kom av sig: finsk-svenska gemenskaper efter 1809 (Stockholm: Atlantis, 2009); Jansson, \"Between Two Worlds.\"\n\n57 Max Engman, Ett längt farväl: Finland mellan Sverige och Ryssland efter 1809 (Stockholm: Atlantis, 2009).\n\n58 Osmo Jussila, Suomen perustuslait venäläisten ja suomalaisten tulkintojen mukaan 1808-1863 (Helsinki: Frenckellin Kiijapino Oy., 1969); Robert Schweitzer, Autonomie und Autokratie: die Stellung des Grossfürstentums Finnland im russischen Reich in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.

I would argue that the contributions by Mikhail Borodkin, Kesar' Ordin, Magnus Schybergson, and Boris Nolde among others are still useful when critically approached.62 Besides addressing the administrative system and tensions\n\n59 Kristiina Kalleinen, Suomen kenraalikuvernementti: kenraalikuvernöörin asema ja merkitys Suomen asioiden esittelyssä, 1823-1861 (Helsinki: Painatuskeskus, 1994); Raimo Savolainen, Suosikkisenaattorit: Venäjän keisarin suosio suomalaisten senaattoreiden menestyksenperustana 1809-1892 (Helsinki: Painatuskeskus, 1994); Raimo Savolainen, \"Släktsenaten 1809-1870 - Senatorssläktema i kollegialitetens bojor,\" Historisk Tidskrift för Finland 77, no. 2 (June 1, 1992), 173-210; Keijo Korhonen, Suomen Asiain Komitea: Suomen korkeimman hallinnon jarjestelytja toteuttaminen vuosina 1811-1826 (Turku: University of Turku, 1963); Robert Schweitzer, The Rise and Fall of the Russo-Finnish Consensus: The History of the \"Second\" Committee on Finnish Affairs in St. Petersburg (1857-1891) (Helsinki: Edita, 1996); Kalleinen, \"The Nature of Russian Imperialism in Finland During the First Half of the Nineteenth Century.\"\n\n60 Carl von Bonsdorff, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, levnadskildring, 3 vols.

While earlier studies drew on the notions of simplified opposition between so-called Fennomania that put forward Finnish-centered cultural endeavors and Svekomania guarding the privileged position of Swedish language, the multifaceted debates on identity were more complex than that.\n\nKurunmaki addresses the fact that besides language, the debates focused on the very principles of nationality-definition as well as on cultural repercussions that were attached to various visions of political system.65 Liberalism, for example, was often attacked as a foreign, Swedish-leaning viewpoint, incompatible with Finnish national project. Jens Grandell demonstrates that Fennomania and Svekomania might have been less antagonistic than traditionally believed, especially during earlier stages of the formulation of respective programmes while also arguing that Finlandish liberalism did not always imply Scandinavianist foundations.66\n\n63 Jani Marjanen, \"Granserna for det offentliga samtalet i Finland 1809-1863,\" in Frie Ord i Norden?, ed.

Matti Klinge's fundamental work analyzes ideas that circulated among the students at the University of Helsingfors and practices of their political manifestation. He focuses on cultural and political tendencies that captured students' attention, including Scandinavianism and Fennomania during the years 1840s-1860s. Most importantly, however, the university provided them with education and space for their practices of self-organization, shared action, and network building that would become crucial for later political struggles and formulation of the principles of Finlandish autonomy.69\n\nAs other researchers demonstrate, visions of the united Scandinavia appeared appealing for certain groups in the duchy either due to the reasons of its liberal rhetoric or given the hopes\n\n67 Axel Lille, Den svenska nationalitetens i Finland samlingsrorelse (Helsingfors: Holger Schildts Tryckeri, 1921); Engman, Sprakfragan; Ilkka Liikanen, Fennomania ja kansa: joukkojarjestaytymisen lapimurto ja Suomalaisen puolueen synty (Helsinki: Suomen historiallinen seura, 1995); Jussi Kurunmaki and Ilkka Liikanen, \"The Formation of the Finnish Polity within the Russian Empire: Language, Representation, and the Construction of Popular Political Platforms, 1863-1906,\" Harvard Ukrainian Studies 35, no. 1/4 (2017): 399-416.\n\n68 Juhani Paasivirta, Finland and Europe: The Period of Autonomy and the International Crises, 1808-1914.\n\n69 Matti Klinge, Studenter och ideer, 2 vols.

The most prominent Scandinavian intellectual of Finlandish descent, however, resided in Stockholm, far from imperial government's direct reach. Emil von Qvanten authored the doctrine that united the struggle for Finnishness with pan-Scandinavian agenda. His work was assaulted by Johan Vilhelm Snellman, one of the leading ideologists of Fennomania, and scholars argue that their debate was crucial for accentuation of respective Scandinavian-leaning and Fennoman positions.71 The fact that this debate was transnational and regional, pertaining to the logic of communication characteristic for the Nordic media systems, however, escaped the attention of earlier researchers.\n\nSweden-oriented programmes of certain groups and newspapers - primarily that of liberal Helsingfors Dagblad - deeply concerned the government officials as Lolo Krusius-Ahrenberg and Lars-Folke Landgren demonstrate.72 Lolo Krusius-Ahrenberg's works, although they came out almost a hundred years ago, still retain their relevance due to her extensive archival research and especially synthetic design that addressed respective positions of Saint-Petersburg, Finlandish administration and public, and even that of Russian diplomats in Stockholm when she had a chance to investigate them. Finland's liminal position not only in terms of identity-building as set in-between Swedishness, Finnishness and imperial loyalty,\n\n70 Runar Johansson, \"Skandinavismen i Finland,\" Historiska och litteraturhistoriska studier, no. 6 (1930): 25668; Hugo E.

Her work, however, appears in the bridging position between Finlandish imperial history as the history of an entangled institutional system and Finlandish history as a story of self-organizations, public manifestations, political imaginations, and cooperations conditioned by the imperial, often repressive context. In a way, my dissertation also seeks to find a bridging position between the two in studying cabinet manifestations and ministerial visions - products of the bureaucratic system - through the optics of the second approach, attentive to political rhetoric, performative practices, and to empire as a context-setting category.\n\nSources\n\nSince the research examines, first, the dynamics of information processing and decision-making in the power grid between Saint-Petersburg, Russian diplomats in Copenhagen and Stockholm, and Finlandish administration, one set of sources addresses the workings of the bureaucratic institutions and patron-client networks that conditioned hierarchy of rule.

First date has been chosen since Scandinavianism as a term for the first time appeared in the Danish newspaper in 1843. Besides, first coherent programmes of the political consolidation under the aegis of Scandinavianism were formulated and declared during this year. One could argue, however, that the genealogy of Scandinavianism spans to earlier period that encompasses the Napoleonic Wars, rise of Romanticism, and union-projects of the beginning of the 19th century. I posit, however, that the driving forces and ideas behind Scandinavianism, apart from obvious continuity, demonstrated ruptures with earlier Romanticist formulations in being generally more exclusive towards German-speaking population of the Oldenburg composite monarchy, more federative-centered, and, essentially, much more diverse in the visions of consolidation.\n\nAlthough the research formally starts with 1843, I also attempt to elucidate processes that spanned from 1830s and involved the intensification of political struggle in Sweden for the reform of representation, liberal agitation there and their echoes in Finland that resulted in administrative concerns. Those years prepared governmental patterns of perceiving Swedish and Scandinavian politics that were afterwards projected onto Scandinavianism as well. Moreover, besides sharpening imaginations and visions, the decade witnessed the elaboration of specific policies aimed at increased administrative control over the Swedish-Finlandish border and circulations of material objects, people, and ideas across it.\n\nThe period from the 1840s to the 1860s was, undoubtedly, the most flourishing with regards to the range of imagined opportunities and expected futures under the flags of Scandinavianism. The proponents of Scandinavian consolidation produced various scenarios of the foreseen community or commonality. Ranging from the establishment of cultural\n\nBeretning om studentertoget til Upsala i juni maaned 1843 (Kebenhavn: Berlingske Bogtrykkeri, 1844); Anton Rosell, Studentbesöket i Finland, 1857 (Stockholm: C.A. Leffler, 1858).\n\nconnections to the Scandinavian federation or dynastic union, these projects often followed separate lines of argumentation, rooted in diverse discourses and practices. On the one hand, Scandinavian-wide context facilitated the quest for similarities, parallels, and closeness of the Nordic nations in past and present that were often framed in terms of their kinship relations. On the other hand, comparative framework also emerged, in which differences of political systems or, in some radical editions, even of national cultures were regarded as nuisances on the way of their rapprochement. The contingency between formulated projects of the Scandinavian future produced certain tension, but their proponents often sought for a path of reconciliation and compatibility, opting rather for hybrid alliances than for the purity of dogmatics.\n\nFinally, the year 1864 when Denmark was defeated during the Second War for Schleswig is regarded as a traditional watershed that put a stop to many ambitions projects of the Scandinavian consolidation, especially in the political field. This view has recently been more and more contested by addressing previously unexplored archival materials111 and by demonstrating the persistence of Scandinavianist imaginations and Scandinavian-wide framework of thinking and acting in other spheres.112 This dissertation, although formally its research scope is limited by 1864, also seeks to challenge the date from another angle. While political impulses of Scandinavianism slowly withered after 1864, the fears of the geopolitical ambitions and revolutionary inclinations of ostensible Scandinavianist ideologists persisted long until the end of the 19th century in Russian imperial cabinets and public discussions. This perseverance of Scandinavianism-related concerns is addressed in conclusion of the dissertation.\n\n111 Ottosen and Glenthej, Union eller undergang.\n\n112 Hemstad, Fra Indian Summer til nordisk vinter; van Gerven, Scandinavism.\n\nResearch design\n\nThe work consists of six chapters supplemented by introduction and conclusion.\n\nBibliography\n\n1.
